Some weights of the model checkpoint at vblagoje/dpr-question_encoder-single-lfqa-base were not used when initializing DPRQuestionEncoder: ['question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of the model checkpoint at vblagoje/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-lfqa-base were not used when initializing DPRContextEncoder: ['ctx_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'ctx_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRContextEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).

     \#\#\# User: According to the [Controlled Substance Act](http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm):

> § 801\. Congressional findings and declarations: controlled substances....
> 
> 
> ...(3\) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through interstate and foreign commerce. **Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because** \-

From what I understand, this means that because of [the Commerce Clause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power:

> To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.

...Controlled Substances may not be exchanged through interstate commerce. Also, because it is impossible to determine whether drugs produced for intrastate commerce are also crossing state lines, then:

> (5\)...**it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate.**
> 
> 
> (6\) **Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.**

Therefore, no intrastate commerce is allowed. However, I don't understand how possession or manufacturing of drugs for personal consumption is covered in the Commerce Clause.

For example, let's say I wish to grow one cannabis plant for personal consumption. In what way does this affect the cannabis market in other states so that Congress has the power to prohibit it?

 \-

\#\#\# Top Answer: To pick up on your comment 'Does this mean if I wish to build a chair for personal use, then since trade of chairs exists between states, Congress has the authority to outlaw possession or manufacturing of chairs?': Yes.

For example, the US Congress can legislate to prohibit a farmer from growing wheat for use on his own farm, on the basis that there is interstate trade in wheat and therefore the Commerce Clause permits Congress to regulate the growing of wheat: *Wickard v Filburn* (1942\) 317 US 111\.

If you grow marijuana, or build a chair, or whatever, you conceivably affect the number of marijuanas, chairs, etc that are traded between states. Therefore you affect interstate commerce. Therefore the US Congress can regulate you. The fact that your marijuana or your chair or your what is trivial in the scheme of the national economy is irrelevant if the aggregation of all regulated marijuana, chairs or wheat is significant: 317 US 111, 127\-128\.

If the law didn't prohibit possession of marijuana absolutely but instead prohibited, say, the carrying of marijuana in schools, then the US Congress might have trouble relying on the Commerce Clause: see *United States v Lopez* (1995\) 514 US 549 and replace 'marijuana' with 'handguns' (OK the marijuana/handgun analogy is bad but hopefully this illustrates that there are at least some limits on Congress' power \-\- it's not just 'any physical object that relates whatsoever to interstate trade therefore unfettered federal legislative power').
Question: 
     A small-scale farmer in Colorado decides to grow a single cannabis plant in their basement for personal use, arguing that it doesn't cross state lines or enter commerce. The federal government seeks to prosecute under the Controlled Substances Act. Which of the following best explains why this action might still be considered within Congress's power under the Commerce Clause?
Answers: 
     [0.110.210.50] - A) The aggregate effect of similar actions could substantially impact interstate commerce
     [0.120.180.56] - B) Personal cultivation of cannabis automatically becomes interstate commerce
     [0.130.200.40] - C) The farmer's action directly impacts the interstate cannabis market by reducing demand
     [0.110.150.34] - D) Growing cannabis, even for personal use, is inherently an economic activity
Correct Answer: 
     A) The aggregate effect of similar actions could substantially impact interstate commerce
