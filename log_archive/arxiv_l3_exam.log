Some weights of the model checkpoint at vblagoje/dpr-question_encoder-single-lfqa-base were not used when initializing DPRQuestionEncoder: ['question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

     The dynamics and prethermalization of one dimensional quantum systems
  probed through the full distributions of quantum noise. Quantum noise correlations have been employed in several areas in physics including condensed matter, quantum optics and ultracold atom to reveal non-classical states of the systems. So far, such analysis mostly focused on systems in equilibrium. In this paper, we show that quantum noise is also a useful tool to characterize and study the non-equilibrium dynamics of one dimensional system. We consider the Ramsey sequence of one dimensional, two-component bosons, and obtain simple, analytical expressions of time evolutions of the full distribution functions for this strongly-correlated, many-body system. The analysis can also be directly applied to the evolution of interference patterns between two one dimensional quasi-condensates created from a single condensate through splitting. Using the tools developed in this paper, we demonstrate that one dimensional dynamics in these systems exhibits the phenomenon known as "prethermalization", where the observables of {\it non-equilibrium}, long-time transient states become indistinguishable from those of thermal {\it equilibrium} states.
Question: 
     A researcher is studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional, two-component boson system using a Ramsey sequence. After analyzing the quantum noise correlations over time, they observe that certain observables of the system appear to match those of a thermal equilibrium state, despite the system not having reached true equilibrium. Which of the following best explains this phenomenon and its implications for understanding the system's dynamics?
Answers: 
     [0.180.240.55] - A) Quantum noise correlations are unreliable for non-equilibrium systems, leading to misinterpretation of the data
     [0.140.170.45] - B) The system has reached a quantum critical point, causing observables to converge regardless of the initial state
     [0.110.150.60] - C) Quantum decoherence has caused the system to rapidly thermalize, reaching a true equilibrium state
     [0.100.140.35] - D) The system has entered a prethermalized state, exhibiting long-time transient behavior that mimics thermal equilibrium
Correct Answer: 
     D) The system has entered a prethermalized state, exhibiting long-time transient behavior that mimics thermal equilibrium
