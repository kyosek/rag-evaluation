Some weights of the model checkpoint at vblagoje/dpr-question_encoder-single-lfqa-base were not used when initializing DPRQuestionEncoder: ['question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of the model checkpoint at vblagoje/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-lfqa-base were not used when initializing DPRContextEncoder: ['ctx_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'ctx_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRContextEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).

Documentation: 
     Item 2. Properties.
As of November 30, 1998, Multicare operated 156 eldercare facilities and 14 assisted living facilities (89 wholly owned, 8 joint ventures, 22 leased and 51 managed). Twenty-two of Multicare's facilities are leased by the respective operating entities from third parties. The inability of the Company to make rental payments under these leases could result in loss of the leased property through eviction or other proceedings. Certain facility leases do not provide for non disturbance from the mortgagee of the fee interest in the property and consequently each such lease is subject to termination in the event that the mortgage is foreclosed following a default by the owner.
The Company considers its properties to be in good operating condition and suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.
The following table summarizes by state certain information regarding Multicare's facilities and outpatient rehabilitation centers at November 30, 1998 (excluding 14 facilities with 1,668 beds at which Multicare provides quality assurance consulting services):
