They lease properties in Riverside and Oakland, California. They also lease a currently unused facility in Mt. Vernon, Ohio.\n\nB) Incorrect. While the company does have a large facility (164,000 sq ft) in Riverside, California, it's not the largest (St. Louis is 270,000 sq ft). Additionally, the undeveloped land is in Stuyvesant Falls, New York, not Toledo, Ohio.\n\nC) Incorrect. The company owns facilities in only three states (Missouri, Ohio, and New York), not four. While they do lease two properties in California, they have not consolidated all disposable products operations into St. Louis. The text mentions consolidating operations into Toledo, not St. Louis.\n\nD) Incorrect. This is close, but contains a crucial error. The company leases (not owns) the unused facility in Mt.

Calculate the average monthly rent\n2. Multiply the average rent by the number of months\n\n1. Average monthly rent:\n   Beginning rent: $55,000\n   Ending rent: $60,000\n   Average = ($55,000 + $60,000) / 2 = $57,500\n\n2. Number of months: 85\n\n3.

For the Salisbury, UK facility (DPL subsidiary):\n   - 15-year lease started in September 2010, so it will still be active in 2024.\n   - Monthly rent is approximately $12,000.\n   - Annual rent: $12,000 \u00d7 12 = $144,000\n\n3.

The closest option to $295,320 is $304,000, but this is not correct because it assumes both leases are active, which isn't stated in the question.\n\n6.
