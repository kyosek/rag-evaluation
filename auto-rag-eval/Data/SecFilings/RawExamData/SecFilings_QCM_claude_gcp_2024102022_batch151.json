Calculate the total gain by subtracting the net book value from the net proceeds:\n   $13.4 million - $11.9 million = $1.5 million total gain\n\n2. Divide the total gain by the number of properties to get the average gain per property:\n   $1.5 million \u00f7 5 properties = $300,000 per property\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and interpret financial data.
