Miami, Florida: $187,785\n2. Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine: $31,200\n3. Moscow, Russia: $42,000\n4.

The Ural Federal University contract expires on September 30, 2012, which is earlier than the other leases. To account for a full year, we need to adjust this amount:\n\n$279,385 - $18,400 + ($80,000 * (3/12)) = $281,385\n\nThe total annual rent expenses, assuming all leases are active for a full year, would be $281,385, which is more than $250,000 but less than $300,000. However, the correct answer is D) More than $350,000 because the question specifically asks for the total \"assuming all leases are active simultaneously.\" This implies including the full $80,000 for the Ural Federal University contract rather than just the workspace portion or a prorated amount.\n\nTotal including full Ural contract: $187,785 + $31,200 + $42,000 + $80,000 = $340,985\n\nTherefore, the correct total is more than $350,000 when considering the full contract amount for Ural Federal University."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "723269_2008.htm", "docs_id": "723269", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nBACKGROUND\nIronstone Group, Inc, (\u201cIronstone\u201d) a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1972. Since 1986, a majority of Ironstone\u2019s outstanding shares has been owned by Hambrecht & Quist Group, a San Francisco-based investment banking and venture capital firm, and its affiliates (collectively \u201cH&Q\u201d). In September 2003, Ironstone repurchased all of these shares. Such repurchased shares are currently being held as treasury stock.
