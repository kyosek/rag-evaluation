According to the documentation, EchoStar has \"multiple gateways throughout the Western part of the United States, Mexico and Canada that support the SPACEWAY 3, EchoStar XVII and EchoStar XIX satellites.\" This statement accurately reflects the company's gateway infrastructure for these specific satellites.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the gateways are not exclusively in the United States; they also extend to Mexico and Canada.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete.
