The correct answer, B, is the most strategic long-term solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Geographic distribution: The current owned locations are concentrated in the West Coast (Portland, OR; Ontario, CA; Newark, CA), East Coast (Upper Marlboro, MD; Elizabethtown, PA), and Midwest (Dubuque, IA; Cedar Rapids, IA; Gainesville, FL). There's a notable gap in the Southeast and central Midwest.\n\n2. Ownership vs. leasing: Nordstrom owns 8 locations and leases 2, suggesting a preference for owned properties in their supply chain strategy. This likely provides more control and long-term cost benefits.\n\n3. Future growth: With plans to open a new omni-channel center in Riverside, CA, Nordstrom is showing continued investment in owned infrastructure.\n\n4. Balance and efficiency: New owned locations in the Midwest and Southeast would create a more balanced network, potentially reducing transportation costs and improving delivery times to those regions.\n\nOption A is less ideal because converting all leased properties to owned ones doesn't address the geographic imbalance.

The correct answer, D, aligns most closely with MercadoLibre's approach for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states, \"Currently, all of our offices are occupied under lease agreements, except for our Argentine and Venezuelan offices.\" This indicates a strong preference for leasing over owning.\n\n2.

Given the information in the SecFilings documentation, which of the following strategies would most likely align with the company's current approach to facilities management?\n\nA) Purchase a large corporate campus to consolidate all operations in one location\nB) Sign long-term leases for multiple specialized facilities with staggered expiration dates\nC) Rely primarily on remote work and maintain only a small headquarters office\nD) Outsource all facility management to a third-party provider and use co-working spaces\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation demonstrates that the company employs a strategy of leasing multiple specialized facilities with different expiration dates. This approach is evidenced by:\n\n1. The principal executive offices and primary network control center are in separate leased spaces in Reston, Virginia, with leases expiring in February 2013 and June 2013 respectively.\n\n2. The company leases additional principal facilities, regional sales offices, and space for remote network switching equipment in various cities.\n\n3. These leases have expiration dates ranging from April 2011 to June 2018, indicating a staggered approach to lease management.\n\n4. While the company does own some space (67,500 sq ft in Lacey, Washington), this appears to be an exception rather than the rule, as it was acquired through an acquisition.\n\nThis strategy allows the company to maintain flexibility in its facilities management, adapt to changing needs, and potentially negotiate better terms by having leases expire at different times. It also aligns with the company's statement that they believe their existing facilities are adequate and that they can acquire suitable additional space as needed for expansion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company primarily leases rather than owns its spaces. Option C is not supported by the evidence, as the company maintains multiple physical locations. Option D is also incorrect, as the company directly manages its leased spaces rather than outsourcing facility management or relying on co-working spaces."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "1007330_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1007330", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "ITEM 2.

The correct answer, C, is the most accurate and relevant conclusion for assessing long-term adaptability because:\n\n1.

The correct answer, B, is the most strategic consideration because:\n\n1. The lease extension option represents a significant long-term financial decision. If exercised, it commits the company to an additional 36 months of obligations beyond the initial term.\n\n2. The extension terms show continued rent increases (from $9,730 to $10,523 over three years), which could impact the company's future cash flows and profitability.\n\n3.

The correct answer, B, is the most financially stable option for the following reasons:\n\n1. Historical context: The property has had inconsistent occupancy, including periods with no tenants and informal agreements with related entities. This suggests a need for a more stable leasing strategy.\n\n2. Current lease terms: The most recent lease agreement (as of 2012) shows a trend towards more formal, structured leasing with an unrelated entity, including options for renewal with built-in rent increases.\n\n3. Financial stability: A long-term triple net lease typically requires the tenant to pay property taxes, insurance, and maintenance in addition to rent. This reduces the landlord's expenses and provides a steady, predictable income stream.\n\n4. Property value: Annual rent increases protect against inflation and ensure growing income over time, which can positively impact property valuation.\n\n5.

The bank in the documentation uses a mixed approach of leasing and owning its financial centers, with 16 owned and 26 leased locations, which is close to a 40:60 owned-to-leased ratio.\n\nThis strategy offers several advantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: Leasing allows for quicker expansion and easier relocation if needed, which is beneficial in a dynamic market.\n2.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation shows that KB Home leases most of its premises across multiple states and even internationally (France and Mexico), including executive offices and branch offices for both housing and mortgage banking operations.\n\n2. This widespread use of leasing, rather than owning properties, suggests a strategy focused on flexibility. Leasing allows the company to more easily enter or exit markets, adjust to market conditions, and avoid the long-term commitments and capital expenditures associated with property ownership.\n\n3.

The correct answer, B, aligns best with the company's existing approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Mixed ownership model: ChoicePoint currently uses a combination of leased and owned properties. They lease most of their office spaces (73 offices in the U.S.) but own specialized facilities like laboratories and data centers.\n\n2. Emphasis on leasing: The documentation states, \"The Company ordinarily leases office space of the general commercial type for conducting its business.\" This suggests a preference for leasing general office space.\n\n3. Ownership of specialized facilities: ChoicePoint owns laboratories through ChoicePoint Health Systems Inc. and a data center in Alpharetta, indicating they prefer to own critical, specialized infrastructure.\n\n4.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that Altron is already constructing a new 104,000 square foot plant in Woburn, scheduled to begin operation in April 1997. This shows a commitment to expansion in that area.\n\n2. The new Woburn plant will be significantly larger (104,000 sq ft) than the current Woburn facility (30,000 sq ft), allowing for substantial capacity increase.\n\n3. By proceeding with the new plant and gradually phasing out the older one, Altron can maintain operational continuity while significantly increasing capacity. This approach minimizes disruption compared to other options.\n\n4. The documentation mentions that with the new Woburn facility, the company will have over 400,000 square feet of space, indicating this expansion is part of a larger capacity strategy.\n\nOption A is less ideal because the Wilmington plant is already quite large (204,000 sq ft) and described as \"one of the largest independent facilities of its kind,\" suggesting further expansion there might be less efficient.\n\nOption B would be disruptive and goes against the company's current investment in Woburn.\n\nOption C focuses only on West Coast operations, which doesn't align with the company's apparent strategy of expanding its East Coast presence.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, consider real-world business strategy, and apply critical thinking to a complex scenario."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "944744_1998.txt", "docs_id": "944744", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 1.
