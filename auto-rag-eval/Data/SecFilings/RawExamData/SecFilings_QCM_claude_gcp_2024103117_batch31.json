The correct answer is B because the document states that the Registrant had 46 producing wells as of December 31, 1995. It also mentions that three wells were sold in 1994 and ten wells were plugged and abandoned due to unprofitable operations over various years. The eight additional wells received in 1993 due to the back-in after payout provision are already accounted for in the 59 productive wells initially drilled. Therefore, the decrease from 59 to 46 is explained by the 3 sold wells and 10 plugged wells.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the information about the 8 additional wells and arrives at an incorrect final count.\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't account for the sold wells and misrepresents the reason for all 13 wells no longer producing.\nOption D is incorrect because while it correctly identifies all the changes, it arrives at an incorrect final count, not aligning with the stated 46 producing wells."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "1157758_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1157758", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.

The documentation clearly states that \"All manufacturing of the Company's products is performed by contract manufacturers having appropriate FDA registration approval for such manufacturing.\" It also mentions that \"Product released for sale is dependent on quality control testing by Alcide.\" This indicates that while manufacturing is outsourced, the company maintains control over quality testing.
