Calculate the number of owned facilities after selling 5: 27 - 5 = 22\n2. Calculate the number of leased facilities after terminating 10%: 45 - (45 * 0.10) = 45 - 4.5 = 40.5, which rounds to 41 (as we can't have partial facilities)\n3. Total facilities: 22 + 41 = 63\n4.

What does this most likely indicate about the company's financial situation and what accounting principle is being applied?\n\nA) The company is anticipating future tax benefits and is recording them as assets, adhering to the matching principle.\n\nB) The company is writing off deferred tax assets due to uncertainty about future profitability, applying the conservatism principle.\n\nC) The company is accelerating tax payments to improve cash flow, following the time value of money principle.\n\nD) The company is recognizing additional tax liabilities, in accordance with the full disclosure principle.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. A valuation allowance for deferred taxes typically indicates that a company is uncertain about its ability to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets in the future. This usually happens when a company has experienced losses or expects future profitability to be insufficient to utilize all of its deferred tax assets.\n\nBy recording this valuation allowance, the company is essentially writing down the value of its deferred tax assets, which is in line with the conservatism principle in accounting. This principle states that potential losses should be recognized as soon as they are probable, while potential gains should only be recognized when they are realized.\n\nOption A is incorrect because recording future tax benefits as assets would be the opposite of what's happening here. Option C is incorrect because accelerating tax payments isn't related to a valuation allowance. Option D is incorrect because while this does involve taxes, it's not about recognizing additional liabilities, but rather reducing the value of tax-related assets.\n\nThis question tests understanding of financial statement notes, deferred taxes, and accounting principles, making it suitable for an advanced accounting exam."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "40888_2017.htm", "docs_id": "40888", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.
