If 18 of these offices were owned by the company, what percentage of their banking offices were leased, and what was the approximate average net book value per banking office (owned and leased combined)?\n\nA) 66.04% leased; $1,034,000 per office\nB) 66.04% leased; $1,245,000 per office\nC) 69.81% leased; $1,034,000 per office\nD) 69.81% leased; $1,245,000 per office\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nTo solve this question, we need to break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Calculating the percentage of leased offices:\n   Total offices: 53\n   Owned offices: 18\n   Leased offices: 53 - 18 = 35\n   Percentage leased: (35 / 53) * 100 = 66.04%\n\n2. Calculating the average net book value per office:\n   Total net book value of premises and equipment: $54.8 million\n   Total number of offices: 53\n   Average net book value per office: $54.8 million / 53 = $1,034,000 (rounded to nearest thousand)\n\nTherefore, 66.04% of the banking offices were leased, and the average net book value per office was approximately $1,034,000.\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly combines both of these calculated values."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "835541_1998.txt", "docs_id": "835541", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nThe Company's manufacturing facilities are located throughout North America, Europe and Asia.

These patents cover some 35 inventions, 25 associated with the NOx reduction business; four associated with FUEL CHEM, one associated with ACUITIV and five associated with non-commercialized technologies.

Further, Fuel Tech believes that the protection provided by the numerous claims in the above referenced patents or patent applications is substantial, and affords Fuel Tech a significant competitive advantage in its business.

The importance of Fuel Tech's patents: The passage states, \"Fuel Tech believes that the protection provided by the numerous claims in the above referenced patents or patent applications is substantial, and affords Fuel Tech a significant competitive advantage in its business.\" It also mentions that \"any significant reduction in the protection afforded by these patents or any significant development in competing technologies could have a material adverse effect on Fuel Tech's business.\"\n\n2.
