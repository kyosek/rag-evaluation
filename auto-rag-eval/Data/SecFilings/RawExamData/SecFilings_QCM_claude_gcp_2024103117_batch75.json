Calculate the square footage for Consumer Solutions:\n   32% of 24.2 million = 0.32 \u00d7 24.2 million = 7.744 million square feet\n\n2. Compare owned vs. leased space:\n   Owned space: 10 million square feet\n   Leased space: 14.2 million square feet\n\nThe Consumer Solutions segment uses approximately 7.744 million square feet (32% of 24.2 million). The company leases more space (14.2 million sq ft) than it owns (10 million sq ft) globally.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most accurate statement, combining the correct calculation for Consumer Solutions' square footage and the correct comparison of leased vs. owned space."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "1078820_1999.txt", "docs_id": "1078820", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

The phrase \"pursuant to our management agreement with ISP\" suggests a more complex arrangement than simple ownership or a standard lease. This is further supported by the fact that the document states the campus is \"owned by a subsidiary of International Specialty Products Inc.\" but occupied by the reporting company under a management agreement. This implies a relationship that likely involves property management responsibilities and possibly shared ownership or other financial arrangements beyond a typical lease.

They lease approximately 121,000 square feet in Tarrytown, NY.\n2. They own the Rensselaer facility of about 104,000 square feet.\n3. They plan to lease an additional 10,000 square feet in Tarrytown.\n4. For future expansion, they mention potentially leasing or purchasing additional facilities, but the immediate plan is for leasing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Regeneron is not centralizing all operations in owned facilities; they use both owned and leased properties.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while they do use leases, there's no indication of a preference for short-term leases. In fact, they've exercised an option to renew their Tarrytown lease for an additional five years.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while purchasing facilities is mentioned as a future possibility, the document doesn't indicate an aggressive acquisition strategy.

Which of the following statements would be most concerning to a potential buyer regarding the long-term viability of this investment?\n\nA) The base rent is subject to adjustments every three years based on the Consumer Price Index.\nB) The original lease included approximately 32,600 square feet that was later removed from the agreement.\nC) The property includes a 100-room motel that was constructed in 1980.\nD) The current lease term ends in 2015, with only a possibility of extension for up to 15 additional years.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most concerning factor for a potential buyer. The current lease term ending in 2015 with only a possibility of extension (not a guarantee) creates significant uncertainty about the long-term control and use of the property. This could potentially limit the buyer's ability to make long-term plans or investments in the property.\n\nOption A is a standard practice and allows for rent adjustments to keep pace with inflation, which is not particularly concerning.\n\nOption B, while noteworthy, doesn't significantly impact the current property's value or usage.\n\nOption C simply states a fact about the property and doesn't present any immediate concern.\n\nOption D, however, introduces a critical time constraint and uncertainty that could significantly affect the property's long-term value and usability, making it the most concerning factor for a potential buyer."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "230498_2012.htm", "docs_id": "230498", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.\nPROPERTIES\nWe operate locations in the United States (38 states), Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Puerto Rico and China.
