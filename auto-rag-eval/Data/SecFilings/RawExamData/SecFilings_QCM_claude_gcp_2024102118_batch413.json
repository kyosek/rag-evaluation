Let's break it down:\n\n1. The sale price of the property was $4,053,000.\n2. The outstanding mortgage balance at the end of 2015 was approximately $1,998,000.\n3. The sale generated approximately $1.7 million in net cash after expenses and mortgage payoffs.\n\nTo calculate the net gain:\n- Start with the sale price: $4,053,000\n- Subtract the mortgage payoff: $4,053,000 - $1,998,000 = $2,055,000\n- This $2,055,000 represents the gross proceeds before expenses.\n- We're told that $1.7 million was generated after expenses and mortgage payoff.\n- Therefore, the expenses can be calculated as: $2,055,000 - $1,700,000 = $355,000\n\nThe net gain is the gross proceeds minus expenses: $2,055,000 - $355,000 = $1,700,000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the gain after accounting for the mortgage payoff and expenses, which is the $2,055,000 figure.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read financial information, perform calculations, and understand the concept of net gain in a property sale context."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "8177_1998.txt", "docs_id": "8177", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
