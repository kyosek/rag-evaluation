To find the square footage in Europe, we calculate 19% of 2,888,000:\n   2,888,000 * 0.19 = 548,720 sq ft\n\n2. To find the percentage this represents of space outside the US:\n   - Total space outside US = 28% of 2,888,000 = 808,640 sq ft\n   - Europe's space / Total space outside US = 540,000 / 808,640 = 0.675 or 67.5%\n\nThe correct answer is 540,000 sq ft (as stated in the text) and 67.5%.
