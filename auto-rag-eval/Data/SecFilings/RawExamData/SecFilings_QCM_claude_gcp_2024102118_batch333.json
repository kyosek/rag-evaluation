PROPERTIES\nThe following information describes the material physical properties owned or leased by the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company leases approximately 10,000 square feet of space for its New York City principal executive offices. The Company's Physical Science Group leases (i) approximately 78,000 square feet of an office building in Columbia, Maryland and (ii) approximately 275,000 square feet of office space at various other locations throughout the United States and (iii) 37 branch offices of General Physics occupy approximately 197,000 square feet of this space.\nThe Distribution Group leases 219,000 square feet in New Jersey and 112,000 square feet in Connecticut. The Optical Plastics Group owns 33,000 square feet of office space in Lancaster, PA and 12,594 square feet of office space in Westmont, IL.\nThe facilities owned or leased by NPDC are considered to be suitable and adequate for their intended uses and are considered to be well maintained and in good condition.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately summarizes the property holdings of the company and its subsidiaries as described in the documentation?\n\nA) The company owns all of its office spaces, with the largest being 275,000 square feet in various locations throughout the United States.\n\nB) The Physical Science Group leases the most square footage, totaling approximately 550,000 square feet across multiple locations.\n\nC) The Distribution Group leases more total square footage than the Optical Plastics Group owns.\n\nD) The company's principal executive offices in New York City occupy more space than the Optical Plastics Group's owned property in Lancaster, PA.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the company leases most of its spaces, not owns them. The 275,000 square feet mentioned is leased, not owned.\n\nB is incorrect. The Physical Science Group leases approximately 78,000 sq ft in Columbia, MD, 275,000 sq ft at various locations, and 197,000 sq ft for 37 branch offices of General Physics. This totals 550,000 sq ft, but it's not the most accurate summary of the overall property holdings.\n\nC is correct. The Distribution Group leases a total of 331,000 sq ft (219,000 in New Jersey + 112,000 in Connecticut). The Optical Plastics Group owns a total of 45,594 sq ft (33,000 in Lancaster, PA + 12,594 in Westmont, IL). The leased space by the Distribution Group is indeed more than the owned space of the Optical Plastics Group.\n\nD is incorrect.

In addition, during 1995 the Registrant renovated or relocated a number of its retail branch offices to accommodate the expanding number of investment brokers and improve client service.
