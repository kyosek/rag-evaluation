The total available space in the building is 253,000 square feet, of which the company leases 153,000 square feet. The lease is structured in two parts: a base lease for 100,000 square feet and an additional lease for 53,000 square feet. If the company decides to exercise both 5-year options on the base lease, and assuming the additional lease is not renewed, what percentage of the building's total available space will the company occupy at the start of the second 5-year option period?\n\nA) 39.5%\nB) 60.5%\nC) 39.9%\nD) 59.7%\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question requires several steps of analysis:\n\n1. The base lease of 100,000 square feet has two 5-year options, while the additional 53,000 square feet lease ends in May 2009.\n2. If both 5-year options are exercised on the base lease, only the 100,000 square feet will be retained long-term.\n3. The total available space in the building is 253,000 square feet.\n4. To calculate the percentage: (100,000 / 253,000) * 100 = 39.5%\n\nOption A (39.5%) is the correct answer. Option B is the current occupancy percentage (153,000 / 253,000 * 100).

Calculate the weighted average monthly lease cost for the known 30 restaurants:\n   (12 * $3,600 + 18 * $5,700) / 30 = $4,860\n\n2. Assume this average applies to all 30 leased restaurants:\n   30 * $4,860 = $145,800 per month\n\n3. Calculate the annual cost:\n   $145,800 * 12 months = $1,749,600\n\n4. Add the annual costs for executive offices, training center, and BYB Properties:\n   $80,040 + $42,500 + $5,200 = $127,740\n\n5.

Based on the given information, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's current European properties and potential relocation implications?\n\nA) The company owns its European headquarters in Geneva, so relocation would involve selling this property.\nB) The company could wait until June 2020 to relocate without breaking any leases.\nC) The company owns distribution facilities in both Strasbourg and Cambrai, providing flexibility for a potential headquarters relocation within France.\nD) The company's European headquarters lease expires in June 2014, necessitating an immediate decision on relocation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states that the European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland is leased, and the lease expires in June 2020. This means the company could wait until June 2020 to relocate without breaking any lease agreements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the European headquarters in Geneva is leased, not owned.\n\nOption C, while partially true (the company does own facilities in Strasbourg and Cambrai), does not address the headquarters situation and is not the most relevant to the question of relocation timing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses the lease expiration date of the Canadian facility in Strathroy, Ontario (June 2014) with the European headquarters lease expiration date (June 2020).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex property information, distinguish between owned and leased properties, and understand the implications of lease expiration dates on business decisions."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "831967_1995.txt", "docs_id": "831967", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "Item 2.
