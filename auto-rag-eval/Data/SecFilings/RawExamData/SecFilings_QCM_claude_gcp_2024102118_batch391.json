The filing states that the company owns numerous properties, including their corporate headquarters, but also mentions a substantial mortgage debt of $470.0 million. This suggests that the company has leveraged a significant portion of their owned real estate, likely to finance operations or expansion.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company does own properties, the large mortgage debt indicates they don't own all properties outright.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because although the filing mentions leasing some properties, it emphasizes ownership of numerous properties, including the corporate headquarters.\n\nAnswer D is an overreach.

The new leases in Herndon, Virginia cost $44,000 per month for both the operations and headquarters facilities.\n2. The company closed its Florida office, which had a monthly rent of $6,000.\n3.

It's clearly closing some facilities (UK, Texas, and Mexico).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Company is consolidating some operations in the Netherlands, it's not shifting all manufacturing there.

The document mentions two potential fees:\n   a) A broker-listing fee for the General Partner\n   b) A 2.5% broker-referral fee for an unaffiliated broker\n\n2. The broker-listing fee for the General Partner is mentioned, but its amount is not specified.

The 2.5% broker-referral fee for an unaffiliated broker is clearly stated.\n\n4.

The phrase \"maximum possible fees\" in the question implies that both fees would apply, but we can only be certain about the 2.5% broker-referral fee.\n\nTherefore, the given information is insufficient to determine the total fees as a percentage of the sale price, making option D the correct answer.
