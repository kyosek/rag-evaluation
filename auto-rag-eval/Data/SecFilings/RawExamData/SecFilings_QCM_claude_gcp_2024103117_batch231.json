The total book value is calculated by adding the $7.1 million (aggregate investment in properties, premises and equipment) and the $1.2 million (aggregate net book value of four other properties), totaling $8.3 million. However, $300,000 of this was classified as held for resale, so the actual book value on the balance sheet would be $8.3 million - $300,000 = $7.1 million.
