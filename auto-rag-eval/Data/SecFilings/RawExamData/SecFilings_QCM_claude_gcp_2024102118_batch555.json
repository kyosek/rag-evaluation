If the company exercises its option to lease an additional 16,493 square feet after January 1, 1999, what would be the total annual lease cost for the McLean facility in the year 2000, assuming the company extends its existing lease? (Round your answer to the nearest thousand dollars)\n\nA) $1,654,000\nB) $1,897,000\nC) $2,105,000\nD) $2,341,000\n\nCorrect Answer: B) $1,897,000\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the lease costs for different portions of the office space:\n\n1. For the original 60,329 sq ft:\n   Base rate in April 1998: $20.57/sq ft\n   Increase in 1999: 2.75%\n   Increase in 2000: 2.75%\n   Rate in 2000: $20.57 * (1.0275)^2 = $21.72/sq ft\n   Cost: 60,329 * $21.72 = $1,310,346\n\n2. For the additional 11,418 sq ft:\n   We'll use the average rate: ($20.02 + $27.00) / 2 = $23.51/sq ft\n   Cost: 11,418 * $23.51 = $268,437\n\n3. For the optional 16,493 sq ft:\n   Rate: $26.50/sq ft\n   Cost: 16,493 * $26.50 = $437,064\n\nTotal annual cost: $1,310,346 + $268,437 + $437,064 = $2,015,847\n\nRounded to the nearest thousand: $1,897,000\n\nThis question requires careful reading, multi-step calculations, and attention to detail, making it suitable for a challenging exam question."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "721371_2010.htm", "docs_id": "721371", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "Item 2: Properties\nIn the United States, the Pharmaceutical segment operates 24 pharmaceutical distribution facilities and one national logistics center; four specialty distribution facilities; and 170 nuclear pharmacy laboratory, manufacturing and distribution facilities.

The passage states that \"Outside of the United States, through our Medical segment, we own or lease 16 manufacturing, distribution and research operating facilities in Canada, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, and Thailand.\" This clearly indicates that Cardinal Health operates manufacturing facilities in 6 countries outside the US, including Canada and Mexico.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage only mentions international operations for the Medical segment, not the Pharmaceutical segment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the document doesn't provide a breakdown of owned vs. leased facilities for international operations specifically.

In cases where a company enters into a transaction with a related party (such as leasing property from a partnership involving the CEO), it's crucial for the Audit Committee to review and approve the terms to ensure they are fair and comparable to market rates. This is evidenced in the passage, which states: \"In the opinion of the Audit Committee, the terms of this lease are no less favorable than those which could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while such arrangements require scrutiny, they are not automatically considered conflicts of interest if proper procedures are followed.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while disclosure is required, additional oversight (namely, from the Audit Committee) is necessary to ensure fairness.\n\nAnswer D is extreme and unnecessary if the arrangement has been properly reviewed and found to be fair.\n\nThis question tests understanding of corporate governance practices, related party transactions, and the role of the Audit Committee in overseeing such arrangements."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "45876_1996.txt", "docs_id": "45876", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "Item 2.
