Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their land use rights situation?\n\nA) The company has permanent ownership of the land and can use it indefinitely for any purpose.\n\nB) The company's land use rights are limited to 50 years, after which they must vacate the property with no option for renewal.\n\nC) The company can renew their land use rights at the expiration of the initial term, and can use these rights as collateral for loans.\n\nD) The company has full ownership rights to the land, but must obtain government permission for any expansions or changes in land use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, land use rights for industrial purposes in China are granted for a period of up to 50 years. However, this period can be renewed at the expiration of the initial and subsequent terms. Additionally, the document states that granted land use rights are transferable and may be used as security for borrowings and other obligations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because in China, all land is owned by the State, and individuals or companies can only acquire rights to use the land, not permanent ownership.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the initial term is limited to 50 years, there is an option for renewal at the expiration of this term.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the company does not have full ownership rights to the land, as all land in China is state-owned. While they may need permissions for expansions, this is not related to land ownership but to land use regulations."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1289480_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1289480", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
