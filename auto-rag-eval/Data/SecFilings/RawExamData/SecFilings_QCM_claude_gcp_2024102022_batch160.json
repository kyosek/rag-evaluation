The document explicitly states that \"The Company utilized a majority of these net proceeds to pay down a $20 million mortgage debt.\" This action aligns with the company's overall property strategy as described in the document. The company leases all of its restaurant locations and seems to prefer this approach, as evidenced by the sale and leaseback transaction.

The document states that the company has entered into a long-term lease for a new global headquarters in Stamford and expects to move there in phases. Upon completion of this move, they plan to sell their owned and operated corporate facility and exit their leased spaces. Additionally, they will \"evaluate options for our television production studio facilities based on strategic, operating and financial considerations.\" This indicates a strategy of moving to a leased headquarters, divesting owned properties, and potentially restructuring their production facilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company is not maintaining its current headquarters but moving to a new leased location. Option C is wrong because they are leasing, not building, a new headquarters and plan to sell their current owned properties, not retain them. Option D is incorrect as the company is staying in Stamford, not decentralizing, and the mentions of Orlando and the UK are related to Performance Centers, not a major operational shift."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1071625_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1071625", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 1.\nBusiness.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the following discussion, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
