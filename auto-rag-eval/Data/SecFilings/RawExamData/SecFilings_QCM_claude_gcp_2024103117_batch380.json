What percentage of the company's owned assets and capitalized leases' original cost has been depreciated, and what does this suggest about the overall age of these assets?\n\nA) 48.0% - This suggests the assets are relatively new, with less than half of their value depreciated.\nB) 52.0% - This indicates the assets are slightly past their mid-life, with just over half of their value depreciated.\nC) 67.9% - This implies the assets are aging, with over two-thirds of their value already depreciated.\nD) 208.3% - This shows the assets are fully depreciated and the company is operating with outdated equipment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: To calculate the percentage of depreciation, we divide the accumulated depreciation by the total cost of owned assets and capitalized leases:\n\n$18.1 billion / $37.7 billion = 0.52 or 52.0%\n\nThis indicates that 52.0% of the original cost of the assets has been depreciated. In accounting terms, this suggests that the assets are slightly past their mid-life, as just over half of their depreciable value has been recognized as an expense. This level of depreciation implies a mix of newer and older assets, which is typical for a large retail operation with ongoing investments in new stores and equipment alongside older, established locations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it underestimates the depreciation percentage. Option C overestimates it, while option D presents an impossible scenario where depreciation exceeds the original cost.
