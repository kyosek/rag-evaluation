This can be concluded from the following information:\n\n1. The 3,750 sq ft research/warehouse facility lease in Shreveport was terminated on November 1, 2016, and not renewed. The rental expense for this space dropped from $28,600 in 2016 to $0 in 2017.\n\n2. The 1,250 sq ft office space lease in Shreveport was also terminated on November 1, 2016, and not renewed.

Of this, 490,000 square feet are used for the distribution center, and 50,000 square feet for service offices. The lease for this location is explicitly stated to expire on January 31, 2007.
