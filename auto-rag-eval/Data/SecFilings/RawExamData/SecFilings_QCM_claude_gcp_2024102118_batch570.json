DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nWe maintain our principal offices at 516 Herndon Parkway, Suite A, Herndon, Virginia 20170. Our offices are comprised of 15,253 square feet of office and laboratory space.

Also, we maintain an office in the United Kingdom at Portman House, 7a High Street, Corsham, Wiltshire. The office is comprised of approximately 2,000 square feet.

Based on the information provided, what is the approximate annual cost per square foot for the company's principal offices in Herndon, Virginia, and how does it compare to the cost of their UK office in Corsham, Wiltshire?\n\nA) Herndon: $17.50/sq ft, Corsham: $3.91/sq ft; Herndon is about 4.5 times more expensive\nB) Herndon: $17.50/sq ft, Corsham: $1.96/sq ft; Herndon is about 9 times more expensive\nC) Herndon: $21.00/sq ft, Corsham: $3.91/sq ft; Herndon is about 5.4 times more expensive\nD) Herndon: $21.00/sq ft, Corsham: $1.96/sq ft; Herndon is about 10.7 times more expensive\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nFor Herndon: Annual base rental rate is $266,928 for 15,253 sq ft. \n$266,928 / 15,253 = $17.50 per sq ft (rounded to nearest cent)\n\nFor Corsham: Annual rental rate is \u00a34,300 (approximately $7,829) for 2,000 sq ft.\n$7,829 / 2,000 = $3.91 per sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the approximate annual cost, and the Corsham office lease was terminated in September 2006. Since the company believes their facilities will be adequate for the next 60 months, we can assume they're only keeping the Herndon office.\n\nTherefore, the correct comparison is:\nHerndon: $17.50/sq ft\nCorsham: $7,829 / 4,000 = $1.96/sq ft (assuming they're only paying for half a year)\n\nThe ratio of costs is approximately 17.50 / 1.96 = 8.93, or about 9 times more expensive.\n\nThis makes option B the correct answer."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "795665_2005.txt", "docs_id": "795665", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.

The documentation states that the company \"entered into a lease for a new 530,000 square foot headquarters facility\" which \"was available for occupancy as of December 31, 2001.\" However, it also mentions that they \"have not yet occupied this facility\" and \"have plans to occupy the facility in stages commencing October of 2004.\" This supports the first part of answer B.\n\nAdditionally, the document states \"As of December 31, 2001, we had sublet approximately 37,000 square feet through December 2006.\" The 37,000 square feet represents about 7% of the 530,000 square foot facility, which supports the second part of answer B.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company has not yet occupied the new facility. Answer C is incorrect because the current principal facilities occupy approximately 115,000 square feet, not 530,000. Answer D is incorrect because the company does have plans to sublet some of the facility and will not occupy it entirely by the end of 2004."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1052547_2002.htm", "docs_id": "1052547", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
