The passage states, \"We are in the process of establishing a manufacturing facility in the PRC. To date we have entered into a letter of intent to lease a facility and have commenced recruiting local personnel.

The documentation states that the Trust's G-3 Notes are essentially \"pass-through\" securities, meaning the Trust's financial activities are limited. Its primary function is collecting payments on residential mortgage loans (income) and paying out interest on various notes and compensation (expenses).

Assuming all options to extend the lease terms are exercised, what is the maximum potential occupancy period for the company in this building?\n\nA) 30 years\nB) 45 years\nC) 60 years\nD) 75 years\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that the company leases its headquarters building \"for an initial term of 30 years which expires in 2003 with options for two 15-year renewal periods.\" To calculate the maximum potential occupancy period, we need to add:\n\n1. Initial term: 30 years\n2. First renewal option: 15 years\n3. Second renewal option: 15 years\n\nTotal: 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 years\n\nTherefore, if the company exercises both renewal options, they could potentially occupy the building for a total of 60 years.\n\nOption A (30 years) is incorrect as it only accounts for the initial lease term.\nOption B (45 years) is incorrect as it only includes one renewal period.\nOption D (75 years) is incorrect as it exceeds the maximum potential occupancy period stated in the documentation."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "876883_2009.htm", "docs_id": "876883", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
