The company moved to gain \"more efficient manufacturing and laboratory space\" and is \"expected to save the Company approximately $1,100,000 per year in future occupancy costs.\" Additionally, the new location is described as \"approximately 20 miles outside of Boston.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the move resulted in cost savings, not higher occupancy costs, and the location is further from Boston, not closer.\n\nOption C is partially correct about lower occupancy costs and room for future growth, but it incorrectly states reduced laboratory space, when the passage mentions more efficient laboratory space.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the building is 160,000 square feet, the company only occupies 105,600 square feet.
