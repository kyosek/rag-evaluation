The documentation states that the weighted average occupancy level for the Mini-Warehouse Properties was 89% in 1998 compared to 90% in 1997, indicating a slight decrease. However, the monthly average realized rent per square foot increased from $0.58 in 1997 to $0.61 in 1998.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the occupancy rate actually decreased slightly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the trend in rent per square foot.
