It not only offers the possibility of expanding the physical space by a significant amount (91,000 square feet), but also allows for extending the lease term for two additional five-year periods. This combination of physical expansion and long-term occupancy rights gives the company the most room to grow and adapt over time.\n\nOption A and B only offer extensions of the lease term without any expansion possibilities, which limits growth potential. \n\nOption C does provide good flexibility in terms of lease extension (three five-year periods) and potential expansion into adjacent buildings, but it doesn't guarantee additional space like Option D does with its specific expansion clause.\n\nTherefore, for a company prioritizing flexibility for future growth, Option D would be the most suitable choice based on the information provided."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1042787_2001.txt", "docs_id": "1042787", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.
