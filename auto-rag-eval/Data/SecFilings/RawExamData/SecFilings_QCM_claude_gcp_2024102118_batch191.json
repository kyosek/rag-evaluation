The passage states that the Company \"continually evaluates the need for expansion of facilities based on its expected growth\" and that management believes \"the Company's manufacturing facilities are presently adequate for current levels of operation.\" This indicates a strategy of maintaining current facilities while planning for potential future expansion. Additionally, the Company was planning to relocate its Corporate Headquarters to a separate location in the Miami area in 1995.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Company did sublease its former ATC, there's no indication of downsizing operations. The relocation of headquarters seems to be a separate decision.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Company owned \"most\" of its principal facilities, not all of them. There's also no explicit mention of expanding manufacturing capabilities in the listed locations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the sublease was not terminated in December 1994.
