Hauppauge, NY property: \n   Final year (2006) rental cost: $372,000\n\n2. Valley Stream, NY property:\n   Final year (2002) rental cost: $170,000\n\n3. Las Vegas, NV property:\n   Final year (2004) rental cost: $52,000\n\nTotal: $372,000 + $170,000 + $52,000 = $594,000\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading of the document to extract the correct information for each property's final year rental cost, and then perform the calculation.

The correct answer, B, accurately combines two key pieces of information: The Hartford leased approximately 1.6 million square feet throughout North America, and owned 1.77 million square feet for its home office complex in Hartford, Connecticut. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while The Hartford did own approximately 1.8 million square feet, the majority was in Hartford, not London. \n\nOption C is incorrect because it misrepresents the overseas leased properties. The company leased 22 thousand square feet in London and 10 thousand square feet in other overseas locations, not an even split.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses owned and leased properties. The Hartford owned 22 thousand square feet in Belgium but leased 22 thousand square feet in London, not the other way around.\n\nThis question requires careful reading and the ability to distinguish between owned and leased properties across different locations, making it challenging for test-takers."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "779544_2008.htm", "docs_id": "779544", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.
