Additionally, the total square footage for these locations is 67,800 (44,400 + 23,400), not 70,000.\n\nB) is incorrect because the document states that the 45 additional offices have \"remaining terms of up to 10 years,\" not exactly 10 years for all.\n\nC) is correct.

As of the date of this report, the Company believes that its equipment and facilities are adequate for its present purposes. The Company\u2019s inactive subsidiary, AZUR Environmental Limited, is the lessee for a real property lease located in the United Kingdom. In 2001, the landlord of the property gave AZUR Environmental Limited its consent to allow AZUR to assign the lease and its related obligations to a third party.

The lease term expires in November 2016 and provides for annual principal rent payments of approximately $150,000.

The annual rent is $150,000, and the lease expires in November 2016. As of the date of this report (assumed to be early 2016), what is the maximum potential liability the company faces related to this lease guarantee, assuming the third party defaults immediately and the company receives no sublease income?\n\nA) $150,000\nB) $300,000\nC) $187,500\nD) $225,000\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C) $187,500.\n\nTo calculate the maximum potential liability, we need to consider the time remaining on the lease and the annual rent amount.\n\nThe lease expires in November 2016, and we're assuming the report date is early 2016. This means there's approximately 9-10 months left on the lease.\n\nThe annual rent is $150,000. To find the liability for the remaining period:\n\n$150,000 / 12 months = $12,500 per month\n\nAssuming 9 months remaining: 9 * $12,500 = $112,500\nAssuming 10 months remaining: 10 * $12,500 = $125,000\n\nThe actual amount would be between these two figures, closer to $125,000 given that November is late in the year.\n\nHowever, as a guarantor, the company might also be responsible for additional costs such as property taxes, insurance, or maintenance. A conservative estimate would add about 50% to the base rent for these potential additional liabilities.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable maximum liability estimate would be:\n$125,000 * 1.5 = $187,500\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze lease terms, calculate prorated amounts, and consider additional potential liabilities beyond just the base rent in a guarantee situation."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "709337_2016.htm", "docs_id": "709337", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.

Option B is inaccurate because not all leases expire within the next year (the Princeton lease extends to 2003), and immediate space concerns are not mentioned.

The company expects to commence mining activities in the first half of 2013. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company is not yet actively mining or distributing minerals, and has only one employee as of December 31, 2012. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the company specifically states it is focused on non-gold industrial minerals, not gold exploration. Additionally, mining activities had not yet commenced as of the end of 2012. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the company mentions the possibility of acquiring companies through equity swap arrangements, there is no indication that this has actually occurred yet.
