Calculate the total subleased space\n2. Identify the space covered by the lease expiring in 2015\n3. Subtract these from the total leased space\n4. Calculate the percentage of remaining space\n\n1. Total subleased space: 57,701 + 68,738 = 126,439 sq ft\n2. Space covered by lease expiring in 2015: 71,746 sq ft\n3. Space to be subtracted: 126,439 + 71,746 = 198,185 sq ft\n4.

This implies the office lease was already in place. The office lease has a 5-year initial term plus a 5-year extension. \n\nBy the time 5 years have passed since the start of the industrial lease, the office lease will likely be in its extended term at $5,617.50/month.\n\nTherefore, the correct total monthly rent after 5 years will be:\n$5,617.50 (office) + $11,519.00 (industrial) = $17,136.50\n\nThis corresponds to answer B."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "6951_1999.html", "docs_id": "6951", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "Item 2: Properties\nInformation concerning Applied Materials\u2019 principal properties at October 31, 1999 is set forth below:\n(1)\nIncludes approximately 941,000 square feet that is \t either currently being subleased or is being marketed for \tsublease.\n(2)\nSubject to loans of $41 million, secured by \tproperty and equipment having an approximate net book value of \t$64 million at October 31, 1999.\nApplied Materials also leases office space for sales and service offices in 70 locations throughout the world: 22 in North America (primarily the United States), 2 in Taiwan, 23 in Japan, 12 in Europe, 6 in Korea and 5 in Asia-Pacific.\nApplied Materials currently owns 167,000 square feet of manufacturing and other operating facilities in California that have not yet been completed and placed in service.
