The documentation states that the company leases its corporate headquarters space with a lease expiring in 2008. It also mentions that the broadcasting studios and office spaces for owned and operated stations are in leased facilities with leases expiring through December 2023.

The lease was originally set to terminate in August 2012 but was extended to February 2013. \n\nTo calculate the approximate lease payment in February 2013:\n\n1.

We can estimate that half of the second year's increase would have been applied:\n\n4. Half of the second year's increase: ($33,880 - $30,800) / 2 = $1,540\n5.

In 2010, the company spent $35,452 on the new corporate office space (from June 1 to December 31) and $25,820 on the old office (from January to May).

If the firm's primary goal is to maximize potential rental income per square foot while minimizing the risk of vacancies, which property should they choose?\n\nA) Mountain View Plaza Shopping Center\nB) Castle Oaks Village Shopping Center\nC) Tower Place Festival Shopping Center\nD) None of the above, as the data is insufficient to make a decision\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) Mountain View Plaza Shopping Center is the correct choice. It has the highest maximum lease rate at $20.88 per square foot and is 100% leased, indicating strong demand and potential for high rental income. The wide range of lease rates ($6.83 to $20.88) also suggests potential for increasing lower-rate leases in the future.\n\nB) Castle Oaks Village Shopping Center has the lowest maximum lease rate ($12.50 per square foot) and is only 92% leased, indicating less demand and potential for vacancies.\n\nC) While Tower Place Festival Shopping Center has a higher average lease rate than Castle Oaks, it's lower than Mountain View Plaza. Additionally, the Partnership only owns an 85% interest in this property, which could complicate management and profit distribution.\n\nD) This is incorrect because the given data is sufficient to make a decision based on the stated criteria of maximizing potential rental income and minimizing vacancy risk.\n\nThis question requires students to analyze multiple factors, including occupancy rates, lease rates, and ownership structures, to make a strategic real estate investment decision."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "46619_2002.txt", "docs_id": "46619", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "Item 2.
