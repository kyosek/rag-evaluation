The Waterbury facility is leased under three separate leases, while the Rocky Mount facility is leased under four separate leases. If the company decides to consolidate its executive offices to a single location with equivalent total square footage, which of the following statements would be true?\n\nA) The company would save approximately $608,000 in annual base rent by consolidating to the Rocky Mount location.\nB) The company would need to lease approximately 67,800 square feet to maintain the same total area.\nC) The average cost per square foot is higher for the Rocky Mount location than the Waterbury location.\nD) The company would have more renewal options if they chose to consolidate to the Waterbury location.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. The annual base rent for Waterbury is $847,000 and for Rocky Mount is $239,000. The difference is $608,000, but this would be the amount saved by consolidating to Rocky Mount, not the other way around.\n\nB) Incorrect. The total square footage of both locations is 44,400 (Waterbury) + 23,400 (Rocky Mount) = 67,800 sq ft. However, the question asks about maintaining equivalent footage, not the sum of both.\n\nC) Correct. The cost per square foot can be calculated as:\n   Waterbury: $847,000 / 44,400 sq ft = $19.08 per sq ft\n   Rocky Mount: $239,000 / 23,400 sq ft = $10.21 per sq ft\n   The Rocky Mount location has a higher average cost per square foot.\n\nD) Incorrect.

The passage states that the company's total manufacturing and research space is approximately 3.4 million square feet, of which approximately 75 percent is owned by the company. This implies that the remaining 25% is leased, making option C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while most sales offices are leased, not all manufacturing facilities are owned. The passage mentions that some manufacturing space is leased.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company has approximately 126 locations in over 40 countries, not over 50.
