Calculate the total annual lease expenses\n2. Calculate the percentage of that total represented by the $5 million for the 138 operating facilities\n\nTotal annual lease expenses = $5 million (operating facilities) + $167.5 million (outdoor sites) = $172.5 million\n\nPercentage for operating facilities = ($5 million / $172.5 million) x 100 = 2.9%\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and calculate percentages.
