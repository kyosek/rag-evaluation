While the Belgian property has the longest current lease term, it's not the largest financial commitment. The Irvine property has a much higher monthly rental ($45,892 vs. approximately $4,000 for the Belgian property).\n\nB) Incorrect. Although the Wilmington property has a lower absolute monthly rental ($4,588), it's actually more expensive per square foot than the Irvine property.

Calculate the total square footage: 72,000 + 21,000 = 93,000 sq ft\n2. Assume the owned buildings have an equivalent lease value, so we keep the $0.6 million annual lease payment for the entire space\n3. Calculate the sq ft per $100,000 of lease payment:\n   93,000 sq ft / ($600,000 / $100,000) = 93,000 / 6 = 15,500 sq ft\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret financial information, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations.
