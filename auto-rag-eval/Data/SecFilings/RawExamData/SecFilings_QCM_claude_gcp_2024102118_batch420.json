The documentation states that Gerald G. Mercer, the Chairman, CEO, and President of the Company, owns the building and leases the land from The Port Authority of Columbus. Mercer then leases the land and building complex to the Company under an agreement expiring in 2004. The land lease between Mercer and The Port Authority of Columbus is a 25-year lease expiring in 2009, with a 20-year renewal option.
