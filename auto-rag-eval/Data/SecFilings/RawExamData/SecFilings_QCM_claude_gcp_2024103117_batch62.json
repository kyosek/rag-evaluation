The documentation clearly states that the company leases most of its restaurant properties in various countries, including South Africa, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Australia, and Hungary. Lease terms vary by country, ranging from two to ten years, and many include options to extend. However, the key distinguishing factor is that the company owns one commercial real estate property in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, which they intend to open as a new Hooter's location. This combination of primarily leasing properties while owning one specific property for future development makes option D the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases its South African restaurant properties, not owns them. Option B is incorrect because U.S. restaurant lease terms vary from two to ten years and do include options to extend.

Based on the information provided in the documentation, specifically the last paragraph, the partnership only wrote down properties to their estimated net realizable values when preparing for liquidation. In this case, the partnership is only considering selling one property, not liquidating. Additionally, the appraised value ($1,100,000) is higher than the book value ($1,000,000), which doesn't necessitate a write-down.
