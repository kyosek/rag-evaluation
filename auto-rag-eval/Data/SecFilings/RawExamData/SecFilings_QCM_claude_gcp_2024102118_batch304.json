Bellmawr, NJ office:\n   The documentation doesn't provide the annual cost for this lease. However, it's mentioned as the corporate headquarters, so we can assume it's significant.\n\n2. Port of Palm Beach lease:\n   The annual cost is clearly stated as $183,200 per year.\n\n3. Toms River, NJ office:\n   This is leased on a month-to-month basis, and the size is much smaller (200 sq ft vs 4,000 sq ft for Bellmawr). We can estimate this cost to be relatively small.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most reasonable estimate for the total annual lease expense would be $199,200 (option C).
