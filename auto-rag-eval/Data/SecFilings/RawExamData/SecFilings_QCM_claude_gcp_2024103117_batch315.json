Calculate the percentage increase in the number of hotels owned and the percentage increase in the total number of rooms. Then, determine which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's expansion.\n\nA) The number of hotels increased by 111.2%, while the number of rooms increased by 106.6%. This suggests the newly acquired properties had, on average, fewer rooms per hotel than the original portfolio.\n\nB) The number of hotels increased by 111.2%, while the number of rooms increased by 106.6%. This suggests the newly acquired properties had, on average, more rooms per hotel than the original portfolio.\n\nC) The number of hotels increased by 111.2%, while the number of rooms increased by 106.6%. This suggests the newly acquired properties had, on average, approximately the same number of rooms per hotel as the original portfolio.\n\nD) The number of hotels increased by 111.2%, while the number of rooms increased by 106.6%. There is insufficient information to draw any conclusions about the relative sizes of the newly acquired properties compared to the original portfolio.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe number of hotels increased from 89 to 188, which is an increase of (188-89)/89 * 100 = 111.2%.\nThe number of rooms increased from 11,371 to 23,490, which is an increase of (23,490-11,371)/11,371 * 100 = 106.6%.\n\nSince the percentage increase in the number of hotels (111.2%) is greater than the percentage increase in the number of rooms (106.6%), this implies that the newly acquired properties had, on average, fewer rooms per hotel than the original portfolio.\n\nThe average number of rooms per hotel in the original portfolio was 11,371/89 = 127.8 rooms.\nThe average number of rooms per hotel in the expanded portfolio is 23,490/188 = 124.9 rooms.\n\nThis confirms that the newly acquired properties indeed had, on average, fewer rooms per hotel, making option A the most accurate statement."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "728303_2011.htm", "docs_id": "728303", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "ITEM 2.
