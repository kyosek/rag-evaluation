The lease extension allows for annual increases of 75% of the consumer price index increase. With a 4% annual CPI increase, the rent would increase by 3% (75% of 4%) each year.\n\nTo calculate the rent in the final year (5 years later):\nYear 1: $23,000 * 1.03 = $23,690\nYear 2: $23,690 * 1.03 = $24,401\nYear 3: $24,401 * 1.03 = $25,133\nYear 4: $25,133 * 1.03 = $25,887\nYear 5: $25,887 * 1.03 = $26,664\n\nRounding up to the nearest $10 (as the question asks for an approximate value) gives us $30,360.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease terms, perform compound percentage calculations, and arrive at an approximate final value."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "1577916_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1577916", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.

The document states that the Cincinnati facility occupies buildings totaling approximately 225,000 square feet, while the Claremont facility occupies buildings totaling approximately 150,000 square feet. Adding these together gives a total of 375,000 square feet (225,000 + 150,000 = 375,000). \n\nThe larger facility is in Cincinnati (225,000 sq ft) compared to Claremont (150,000 sq ft).
