As of December 21, 2004, Sicor has an existing sublease for 44,000 square feet expiring in September 2005, and they have also entered into a new lease agreement for up to 82,000 square feet. The new lease commences on the later of September 1, 2005, or when certain improvements are completed. This means there will likely be a period where both leases are active simultaneously.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the move-in date for the new facility is not guaranteed to be September 1, 2005. It could be later depending on when improvements are completed.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the current sublease does not have an option to renew. The document explicitly states they do not have a contractual option to renew the sublease.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the new lease has an initial term of 10 years with two 5-year renewal options, this totals a maximum of 20 years, but it's not a fixed 20-year term."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "352955_2015.htm", "docs_id": "352955", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.\nPROPERTIES\nThe Company owns a total of approximately 13,195 net acres all located in Louisiana.
