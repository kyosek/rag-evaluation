Calculate the current rent per square foot:\n   $234,000 / 27,400 sq ft = $8.54 per sq ft\n\n2. Calculate the new annual rent for 20,100 sq ft:\n   20,100 sq ft * $8.54 per sq ft = $171,654\n\n3. Subtract the tenant improvement allowance:\n   $171,654 - $154,400 = $17,254\n\n4. Add back the prorated allowance for 3 months (April 1 to June 30):\n   $154,400 / 12 months * 3 months = $38,600\n   $17,254 + $38,600 = $55,854\n\n5. Add the regular rent for 9 months (July 1 to March 31):\n   $171,654 / 12 months * 9 months = $128,740.50\n\n6. Total approximate net annual rent:\n   $55,854 + $128,740.50 = $184,594.50\n\nThe closest answer is $172,360 (D), which accounts for some rounding and estimation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "883981_2000.txt", "docs_id": "883981", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

The company already owns a 360,000 square foot distribution facility in South Carolina, indicating that distribution is a key part of their operations.\n2. They have a short-term lease for an additional 26,000 square feet of distribution space, suggesting a need for more distribution capacity.\n3. The company sold or closed all manufacturing facilities in 1999 and 2000, making option B unlikely.\n4. The retail outlet stores only comprise about 104,000 square feet total, so a 50,000 square foot expansion (option D) would be disproportionate.\n5.

This dual role creates a potential conflict of interest, as Harris could potentially influence the terms of the office arrangement to benefit either Frontier or Empire Foods/Ledbetter unfairly.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the initial arrangement was rent-free, and the subsequent rent is not necessarily proven to be at market rate.\n\nAnswer C, while identifying a relationship between Frontier and Ledbetter, does not fully capture the core conflict of interest involving Terry Harris's dual roles.\n\nAnswer D, while noting a legitimate concern, does not address the primary conflict of interest issue stemming from Harris's positions in both companies.\n\nThis situation raises corporate governance concerns as it could be seen as a related-party transaction that might not be at arm's length, potentially benefiting insiders at the expense of other stakeholders."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "948545_2003.htm", "docs_id": "948545", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
