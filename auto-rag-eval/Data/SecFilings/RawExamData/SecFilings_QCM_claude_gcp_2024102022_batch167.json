PROPERTIES Rio Blanco Properties - On December 17, 1987, The Oil Shale Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tosco Corporation exercised the Purchase Option on the Rio Blanco Properties. Details of the transaction are as described in the discussion of the Asphalt Feasibility Program. Pilot Plant Lease - On October 15, 1982, Paraho Development leased 200 acres of private land near Rifle, Colorado from an individual for an initial term of ten years with provisions for extensions. The leased land provides a location for the Company to operate its pilot oil shale retort facility, and management considers the land to be adequate space to enable New Paraho to carry out research operations. As renegotiated on October 8, 1992, the lease calls for an annual minimum rent of $6,000 and an operational rate of $28,296 per year. The new lease expires in October, 2002. The rent for the land at the operational rate for the twelve months ended June 30, 1996 was prorated on a daily basis.

The documentation states that New Paraho leases 200 acres near Rifle, Colorado for their pilot plant, with the current lease expiring in October 2002. In Utah, the company owns an undivided 80% interest in 160 acres, and controls the remaining 10,272 acres through State of Utah Leases or agreements with third parties.

The Company has 27 leased dental laboratories.\n2. The average annual base rent for these laboratories is $45,100.\n\nWe're not given the exact total square footage of the leased laboratories, but we can calculate an estimate:\n- The laboratories range from 1,000 to 21,000 square feet.\n- If we assume an average size, it would be (1,000 + 21,000) / 2 = 11,000 square feet.\n- Total estimated square footage: 27 x 11,000 = 297,000 square feet\n\nNow we can calculate the average annual rent per square foot:\n$45,100 / 11,000 sq ft = $4.10 per square foot\n\nHowever, this is the average for each individual laboratory. The question asks for the overall average, which would be:\n(27 x $45,100) / (27 x 11,000) = $1,217,700 / 297,000 sq ft = $2.86 per square foot\n\nThis makes A) $2.86 per square foot the correct answer.
