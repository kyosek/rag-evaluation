We know that:\n1. Univest has a total of 37 properties.\n2. There are 28 traditional offices, 7 supermarket branches, 1 work site office, and 1 express banking center.\n3. 15 banking offices are in Montgomery County.\n4. The work site office and express banking center are in Montgomery County.\n\nTo solve:\n1. Total banking offices = 28 + 7 = 35 (traditional + supermarket)\n2. Offices in Montgomery County = 15\n3. Offices in Bucks County = 35 - 15 = 20\n4. However, the question asks for the total banking offices, which includes the work site office.\n5. The work site office is in Montgomery County, so it doesn't affect the Bucks County count.\n6. Therefore, the total banking offices in Bucks County is 20 + 1 = 21 (adding the 1 to account for the difference between the total 37 properties and the 36 we've accounted for so far).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read, extract relevant information, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "740553_1998.txt", "docs_id": "740553", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 8.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nBACKGROUND\nIronstone Group, Inc, (\u201cIronstone\u201d) a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1972. Since 1986, a majority of Ironstone\u2019s outstanding shares has been owned by Hambrecht & Quist Group, a San Francisco-based investment banking and venture capital firm, and its affiliates (collectively \u201cH&Q\u201d). In September 2003, Ironstone repurchased all of these shares. Such repurchased shares are currently being held as treasury stock. The Hambrecht 1980 Revocable Trust presently owns over 50% of Ironstone\u2019s outstanding voting shares.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nCurrently, the Company is reviewing options and new business opportunities. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $10,920 in marketable securities, $1,566 in cash, an investment in Salon Media Group, Inc. valued at $92,297 and tax loss carry-forwards at its disposal.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will acquire businesses, form additional alliances, or expand its existing services. Failure to expand the scope of services provided by the Company may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company had one part-time employee.

Additionally, the company had only one part-time employee who received no compensation. This situation aligns with a company that is in a transitional phase, looking for new opportunities while operating with minimal resources.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document does not indicate any active expansion of services or a large workforce. In fact, it mentions only one part-time employee.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while Hambrecht & Quist Group (an investment banking and venture capital firm) previously owned a majority of Ironstone's shares, the company repurchased these shares in 2003.
