The passage states that John Deere owns approximately 59.1 million square feet of facilities and leases an additional 15.2 million square feet. The total is therefore 59.1 + 15.2 = 74.3 million square feet. To calculate the percentage leased, we divide the leased square footage by the total: 15.2 / 74.3 \u2248 0.2046, or 20.5% when rounded to one decimal place. This makes option A the correct answer. Options B and D use the owned square footage as the total, which is incorrect.
