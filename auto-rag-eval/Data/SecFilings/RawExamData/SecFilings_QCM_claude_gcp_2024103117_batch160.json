Let's break down the options:\n\nA) Building #1 (144,315 sq ft) + Building #2 (122,435 sq ft) = 266,750 sq ft. Adding 133,250 sq ft from adjacent land reaches 400,000 sq ft, but involves developing the owned land, which is not mentioned as an immediate option.\n\nB) Building #2 (122,435 sq ft) + Building #3 (158,075 sq ft) = 280,510 sq ft.
