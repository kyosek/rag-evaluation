In October and November 2009 the Company moved its operations to this facility. Total rent expense for fiscal 2009 was $168,000 and for fiscal 2010 was $236,872.

It also mentions that \"Part of the increase was due to overlapping rents.\" The increase from $168,000 to $236,872 represents a 41% increase (($236,872 - $168,000) / $168,000 = 0.41 or 41%).
