The series of transactions described in the document suggests that the company's primary motivation was to secure a rent-free lease agreement for a transitional period.

According to the documentation, on November 27, 1996, the Partnership, DSC, and SFN executed the Liquidating Sale. As a result of this sale, the Partnership received net proceeds of $2,772,051 for its crane fleet and $7,366,940 in distributions from DSC attributable to its interest in the proceeds from the sale of the DSC crane fleet. The total of these two amounts is $10,138,991.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Partnership did not acquire DSC and SFN; rather, it participated in a sale with them.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the Partnership is in the process of dissolving, it has not yet been dissolved due to a pending class action suit. Additionally, there's no mention of distributing the entire amount to unitholders.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while there is a mention of a class action lawsuit, it's not stated that this lawsuit resulted in freezing the assets.
