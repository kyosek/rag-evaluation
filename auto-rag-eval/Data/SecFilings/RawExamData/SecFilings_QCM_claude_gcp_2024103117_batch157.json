The CompuSafe\u00ae service is showing strong growth potential, with unit installations outpacing revenue contribution. The 37% increase in installed units (from about 7,500 to 10,300) represents significant expansion of the service. While it currently accounts for only 7% of North America's revenues, the rapid growth in installations suggests that Brink's is investing heavily in this service, likely anticipating future revenue growth. The discrepancy between the high growth rate in units and the current revenue contribution indicates that there's potential for increased revenue as these newly installed units begin generating income over time.
