Additionally, the 250,000 square feet of owned buildings contradicts the claim that all stores were leased.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document explicitly states that Coach operated stores in mainland China: \"41 Coach-operated department store shop-in-shops, retail stores and factory stores in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\""}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1066256_2000.txt", "docs_id": "1066256", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 8.

There are separate financial statements for \"January 1, 1998 to May 21, 1998 (predecessor)\" and \"May 22, 1998 to December 31, 1998\". This split in reporting periods, along with the term \"predecessor\", strongly suggests that the company underwent a significant change in ownership or structure on or around May 21, 1998.\n\nOption C is the most likely explanation for this change. When a company is acquired or undergoes a leveraged buyout, it's common to have separate financial reporting periods for the time before and after the transaction. The use of \"predecessor\" for the earlier period further supports this interpretation.\n\nOption A (IPO) typically wouldn't cause such a split in reporting periods. Option B (merger) could potentially cause this, but the term \"predecessor\" is more commonly used in acquisition scenarios. Option D (changing fiscal year) wouldn't explain the mid-year split or the use of \"predecessor\".\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to interpret financial reporting structures and infer significant corporate events from the presentation of financial statements."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "884130_2000.txt", "docs_id": "884130", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.
