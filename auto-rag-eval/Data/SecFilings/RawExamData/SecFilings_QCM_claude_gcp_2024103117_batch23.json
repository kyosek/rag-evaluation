There are indeed 556 total condominium units. However, the key lies in understanding that some larger units can be split into smaller accommodations. The document states that \"three-bedroom condominium units become hotel accommodations as a two-bedroom suite with a separate adjoining hotel room\" and \"Some two-bedroom condominium units become hotel accommodations as a one-bedroom suite with a separate adjoining hotel room.\" This splitting allows for more hotel accommodations than the total number of condominium units. Furthermore, the document specifies that as of December 31, 2020, there were 508 hotel accommodations participating in the Rental Pool, which is already more than the 408 units specifically designed for hotel occupancy in the Walking Village.

While the Fremont facility is the largest at 61,500 sq ft, its lease only extends to December 2006. The Armenia facility is owned, so it doesn't have a lease term.
