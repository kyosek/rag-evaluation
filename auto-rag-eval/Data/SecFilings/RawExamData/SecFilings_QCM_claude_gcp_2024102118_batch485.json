A majority of the land owned or leased by the Company is intended to serve as aggregate reserves. There are no significant encumbrances against owned property. The Company's leases for aggregate reserves generally limit the Company's interest in the reserves to the right to mine the reserves. These leases range from month-to-month leases to leases with expiration dates ranging from January 2000 to June 2016.

It also mentions that the Company leases approximately 4,302 additional acres of land in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that all owned land is permitted and in use, which contradicts the information about 1,500 acres being un-permitted reserves.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage specifically mentions that the leases for aggregate reserves generally limit the Company's interest to the right to mine the reserves, not full ownership.\n\nOption C is partially correct about the owned and leased office and shop space, but it's not the most comprehensive answer.

The text states that KPL's operational headquarters in Wichita, Kansas, is held under a lease expiring in 2004. For ST, it's mentioned that the majority of its facilities are owned, but the remainder, including most terminal facilities in port areas and its operational headquarters in Dallas, Texas, are held under lease agreements. This combination of owned and leased properties for ST, along with the leased KPL headquarters, is only accurately captured in option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it states all properties are owned, which contradicts the information about leased properties. Option B is wrong because it incorrectly states that ST only leases its operational headquarters, ignoring the leased terminal facilities.
