The documentation clearly states that Empire does not maintain any office facilities, including a principal executive office. It only uses a mailing address in Toronto for which it pays no rent. Furthermore, the company disposed of its subsidiary IMM on January 4, 2010, which held an investment in Armistice Resources Corp. As a result of this disposal, Empire no longer has any interest in mining operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Empire does not maintain a principal executive office and no longer has active mining operations.\n\nOption B is wrong because while Empire once had an interest in Armistice Resources Corp. through its subsidiary IMM, it no longer owns this subsidiary or has any interest in Armistice.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Empire does not rent any office space, and there's no mention of actively seeking to acquire mining properties.
