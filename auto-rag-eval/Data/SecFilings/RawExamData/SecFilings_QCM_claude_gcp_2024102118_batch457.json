For the Portland office, we know the rate will increase to $29,988 by the end of the lease. To account for this, we should use the average of the current and future rates:\n\nAverage monthly rate for Portland: ($27,846 + $29,988) / 2 = $28,917\nAdjusted annual expense for Portland: $28,917 x 12 = $347,004\n\nTotal adjusted annual expense:\n$347,004 + $150,504 = $497,508\n\nRounding up to the nearest option gives us $501,456, which is answer B.\n\nThis question tests understanding of lease accounting, attention to detail in extracting relevant information, and the ability to apply straight-line accounting principles."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "883522_1997.txt", "docs_id": "883522", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.
