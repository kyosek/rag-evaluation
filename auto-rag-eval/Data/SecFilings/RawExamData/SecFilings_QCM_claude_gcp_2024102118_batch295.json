The Oceanside office lease still has 1 year remaining on a 3-year term. While it's mentioned that the rate is above market and they're looking to renegotiate, it may be challenging to achieve significant savings in the short term due to the existing contract.\n\nB) Incorrect. The Las Vegas office has a 40-month lease, which suggests it's a relatively new and long-term commitment. Terminating this lease early would likely incur penalties, making it an ineffective short-term cost-saving measure.\n\nC) Correct. The Sacramento main office (5,000 sq ft) and warehouse (2,500 sq ft) are both on month-to-month leases, costing $2,746 and $1,200 per month respectively, totaling $3,946. By consolidating these into a single location, Pro-Tech could potentially save a significant portion of this amount. Given the flexibility of month-to-month leases and the mentioned availability of office and warehouse space in the market, this option is the most feasible for achieving a 20% reduction in short-term lease expenses.\n\nD) Incorrect. While the Reno office is on a month-to-month lease and they are considering renegotiation, it's unlikely that renegotiating this single lease would achieve a 20% reduction in overall lease expenses, especially considering it's not the highest cost lease among their properties."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "837893_1997.txt", "docs_id": "837893", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.
