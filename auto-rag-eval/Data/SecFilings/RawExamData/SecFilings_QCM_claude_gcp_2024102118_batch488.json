The documentation clearly indicates that SecFilings uses a mixed approach to property ownership and management. They own voice, video, and data distribution plant and equipment, but often attach this equipment to utility poles under rental agreements with various utility companies. The company both owns and leases real property for signal reception sites, headend locations, market administrative offices, customer call centers, data centers, and corporate offices. This hybrid model allows SecFilings to balance control over critical infrastructure with the flexibility of leasing where appropriate.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company owns much of its equipment, it doesn't exclusively own all assets, as evidenced by the pole rental agreements and leased properties.\n\nAnswer B is inaccurate because the company doesn't primarily lease all real estate and equipment. The documentation states they own various assets and properties as well.\n\nAnswer D is entirely incorrect, as the documentation clearly shows that SecFilings directly manages and owns much of its infrastructure rather than outsourcing everything to third parties."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1518487_2013.htm", "docs_id": "1518487", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "ITEM 2.
