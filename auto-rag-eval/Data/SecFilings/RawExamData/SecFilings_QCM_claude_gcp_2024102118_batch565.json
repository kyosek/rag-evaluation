The documentation states that the company leases space for \"substantially all\" of its stores and service centers, with most leases being five-year terms. These leases also contain renewal options for additional periods of three to five years. This approach balances flexibility (shorter initial terms) with stability (renewal options). It allows the company to adjust its real estate portfolio as needed while maintaining some consistency in location. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company leases most locations, not owns them. Answer B is incorrect because the leases are typically five years, not long-term (10+ years), and they do have renewal options.

The documentation clearly states that SpinCycle leases 166 of their store locations and owns the real estate for six stores. \n\nOption A is incorrect because not all stores were leased; some were owned.\nOption B is incorrect because SpinCycle owned 6 out of 172 stores, which is approximately 3.5%, not 10%.\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation states that stores generally range from 3,500 to 5,500 square feet, not 2,500 to 4,500 square feet.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret numerical data from the given text, as well as their attention to detail in distinguishing between similar but incorrect options."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "807524_2001.txt", "docs_id": "807524", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.
