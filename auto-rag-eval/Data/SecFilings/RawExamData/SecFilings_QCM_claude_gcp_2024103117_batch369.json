The documentation states that \"Twenty-eight of the plants are located on-site at customer facilities,\" which is approximately one-third of the total 85 plants mentioned. Additionally, the footnote (1) indicates that \"Substantially all of the Company's domestic tangible and intangible assets are pledged as collateral pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Company did have 85 plants, they were not all located outside the United States. The US is listed among the countries where plants were located.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that the Company believed its plants were in good condition, but it's not specified that they owned facilities in all 14 countries listed. Also, the total number of countries is 14, not just the owned facilities.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document does not state that all manufacturing facilities were leased. It mentions both owned and leased facilities.
