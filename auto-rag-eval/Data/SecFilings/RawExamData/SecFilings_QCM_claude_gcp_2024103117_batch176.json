First, we need to calculate the total acreage of the Martin Parcel. If the western tract (15.76 acres) represents 62.79% of the total, we can calculate the total acreage as follows:\n   15.76 / 0.6279 = 25.1 acres (which matches the given total in the passage)\n\n2. The passage mentions two potential broker fees:\n   - A broker-listing fee for the General Partner (amount not specified)\n   - A 2.5% broker-referral fee for an unaffiliated broker\n\n3. The question asks for the maximum potential fee, which would include both fees if applicable.\n\n4. Since the broker-listing fee amount isn't specified, we need to assume it could be up to the industry standard, which is typically around 2.5%.\n\n5. Therefore, the maximum potential fee would be the sum of both fees:\n   2.5% (potential broker-listing fee) + 2.5% (broker-referral fee) = 5.0%\n\nThis makes C) 5.0% the correct answer, as it represents the maximum potential combined fee percentage."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "56873_2008.htm", "docs_id": "56873", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.

To calculate the total rent:\n\n1. Calculate the average monthly rent:\n   ($55,000 + $60,000) / 2 = $57,500\n\n2. Multiply the average rent by the number of months:\n   $57,500 * 85 = $4,887,500\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex document, understand the concept of linear increase, and perform multi-step calculations.
