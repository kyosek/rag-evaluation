Calculate the average rent per facility\n2. Determine the total number of facilities after expansion\n3. Calculate the new total rent\n\n1. Average rent per facility:\n   Total facilities = 10 + 11 = 21\n   Average rent = $6.3 million / 21 = $0.3 million per facility\n\n2. New total facilities:\n   Current = 21\n   New additions = 2 manufacturing + 1 wood mill = 3\n   Total after expansion = 21 + 3 = 24\n\n3. New total rent:\n   $0.3 million x 24 = $7.2 million\n\nHowever, the question asks for the approximate total rent, and the original $6.3 million likely includes other leased properties not explicitly mentioned (e.g., executive headquarters). So we should add the incremental rent to the original amount:\n\n$6.3 million + (3 x $0.3 million) = $6.3 million + $0.9 million = $8.19 million\n\nTherefore, the approximate total rent after expansion would be $8.19 million."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "830122_2008.htm", "docs_id": "830122", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.

What is the most likely total size of this building, and what can we infer about the company's property management strategy?\n\nA) Approximately 164,000 square feet; the company is focused on maximizing the use of owned property through partial leasing.\nB) Exactly 164,000 square feet; the company is primarily a real estate management firm.\nC) At least 164,000 square feet; the company prioritizes owning large properties and leasing excess space for additional income.\nD) About 200,000 square feet; the company maintains significant unused space for future expansion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that the company occupies 59,000 square feet and leases 105,000 square feet to Siemens, totaling at least 164,000 square feet. However, the use of \"approximately\" for their occupied space and the lack of a total figure suggests the building could be larger than 164,000 square feet. \n\nThe company's strategy of owning a large property and leasing a significant portion to another company indicates they prioritize property ownership and generate additional income through leasing excess space. This approach allows for flexibility in future space needs while offsetting costs.\n\nAnswer A is close but doesn't account for potential additional space.
