BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nPrize Energy Corp., including its subsidiaries (\"Prize\" or the \"Company\"), is a mid-size public independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the acquisition, enhancement, and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties. Prize began operations in January 1999 as a privately-held company. On February 8, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Vista Energy Resources, Inc. (\"Vista\") through a reverse merger and became a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol \"PRZ\". Consequently, the description of Prize's business and oil and gas properties will be based upon the combined companies, as if the merger had already taken place.\nPrize currently owns oil and gas properties in three core operating areas which are principally located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area of Texas and Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent area of Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Over 90% of Prize's oil and gas property base is located in Texas.

According to the documentation, Prize Energy Corp. became a publicly traded company on February 8, 2000, through a reverse merger with Vista Energy Resources, Inc. This led to Prize being listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol \"PRZ\". The documentation explicitly states that the description of Prize's business and oil and gas properties is based on the combined companies, as if the merger had already taken place. This process allowed Prize to transition from a privately-held company to a public one.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of an IPO or the New York Stock Exchange. Option C is false as there's no information about a leveraged buyout or a focus on the Gulf of Mexico. Option D is incorrect because the company wasn't spun off from a parent corporation, and while it does have operations in the Permian Basin, this isn't its exclusive focus.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to identify the specific corporate action that led to Prize becoming a public company and its impact on how the company's business is described in the documentation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1496454_2015.htm", "docs_id": "1496454", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had investments in 144 real estate investment properties.

The company is selling its controlling interest in two properties:\n   - One with a 90% controlling interest (mentioned in footnote 1)\n   - One with a 75% controlling interest (mentioned in footnote 4)\n4.
