The document states that \"Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property.\" It also mentions that \"Lands over which pipeline rights-of-way have been obtained may be subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants.\" Additionally, it notes that \"In some cases, property on which our pipeline was built was purchased in fee.\" This combination of rights-of-way (which could be subject to prior liens) and some outright land purchases aligns with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does not own all land in fee simple. Option C is wrong because the company doesn't lease all land; they have rights-of-way and some owned property. Option D is inaccurate because rights-of-way are not exclusively granted by government authorities; they are primarily granted by property owners."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "4319_1996.txt", "docs_id": "4319", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.
