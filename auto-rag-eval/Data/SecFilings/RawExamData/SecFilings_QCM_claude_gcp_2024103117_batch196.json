These patents cover some 44 inventions, 32 associated with the NOx reduction business; 2 associated with FUEL CHEM, 2 associated with ACUITIV and 9 associated with non-commercialized technologies. These inventions represent significant enhancements of the application and performance of the technologies. Further, Fuel Tech believes that the protection provided by the numerous claims in the above referenced patents or patent applications is substantial, and affords Fuel Tech a significant competitive advantage in its business. Accordingly, any significant reduction in the protection afforded by these patents or any significant development in competing technologies could have a material adverse effect on Fuel Tech's business.\nApart from its intellectual property, the property of Fuel Tech is not material.\nFuel Tech and its subsidiaries operate from leased office and engineering facilities in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles; Batavia, Illinois; Stamford, Connecticut; and Milan, Italy.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Fuel Tech's intellectual property portfolio includes patents covering various inventions.

The identical statements across multiple subsidiaries (AEGCO, AEP, APCO, etc.) strongly suggest that these are part of a consolidated entity, likely subsidiaries of a parent company. This is a common practice for large corporations with multiple subsidiaries. The uniform reference to Item 14 for all subsidiaries indicates a centralized, consistent approach to financial reporting within the corporate structure. This allows for streamlined reporting and often reflects a parent-subsidiary relationship where the parent company consolidates financial information for all its subsidiaries.

Main office and shop floor space: $10,290 per month for 12 months = $123,480\n2. Excess office and storage space: $6,047 per month for 12 months = $72,564\n3.
