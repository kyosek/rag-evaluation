The text then specifies that \"all remaining assets of the Company not covered under the Industrial Revenue Bond are secured under the Company's $20 million term loan.\" This clearly shows that the security structure is split between the Industrial Revenue Bond (for part of the Wilmot facility) and the term loan (for remaining assets), making option C the most accurate description.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all assets are secured under the term loan; part of the Wilmot facility is secured by the Industrial Revenue Bond.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it states the entire Wilmot facility is secured by the Industrial Revenue Bond, which contradicts the \"certain of the Wilmot, Wisconsin facilities\" statement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no indication of an equal division of assets between the two security arrangements."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1000180_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1000180", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur principal facilities are located in Sunnyvale, California.
