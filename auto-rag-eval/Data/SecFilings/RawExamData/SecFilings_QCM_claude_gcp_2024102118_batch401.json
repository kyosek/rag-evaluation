Cheese's restaurants and managed 4 restaurants for others, with no franchise operations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. The passage states that as of March 15, 1996, the company operated 226 Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants (including four managed for others), and franchisees operated an additional 93 restaurants. It also mentions that the Company and its franchisees operate in a total of 44 states, with the company concentrating its ownership and operation within a 27-state area.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misrepresents the number of states (50 instead of 44) and doesn't account for the 4 managed restaurants.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the total number of restaurants is accurate (226 + 93 = 319), it wrongly states that all locations are across 27 states, when in fact they are spread across 44 states.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the 93 franchised locations and incorrectly states the number of company-operated restaurants."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1091171_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1091171", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 1.\nBusiness\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve many risks and uncertainties.
