The Company estimates that its strip facilities operated at an estimated 80% of productive capacity in fiscal 1996, and the Company's slitting equipment at its steel service centers operated at approximately 70% of productive capacity in fiscal 1996.\nThe Company continually reviews its space needs and opportunities for expansion and in fiscal 1996 began a major expansion at its facility in Ottawa, Ohio to increase the Company's conventional strip capacity. The estimated $22 million project will increase the square footage of the plant by approximately 90,000 square feet, increase capacity for cold-rolled strip production by approximately 40% and will increase maximum product width capabilities. The new facility is scheduled to start\nproduction in mid-fiscal 1997. In connection with this project, the Company has obtained a $21.8 million term loan, subject to certain contingencies. Upon completion of the project, the loan proceeds will be used primarily to retire committed facility borrowing associated with the Ottawa plant expansion.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The company's expansion project in Ottawa, Ohio is expected to have several impacts.

Calculate the monthly rental expense for both facilities\n2. Multiply the total monthly expense by 12 to get the annual cost\n\nHouston monthly rent: $10,000\nBeijing monthly rent: $11,000\nTotal monthly rent: $10,000 + $11,000 = $21,000\n\nAnnual rent: $21,000 \u00d7 12 months = $252,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) $252,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it's the result of calculating 11 months instead of 12.\nOption C is incorrect as it only accounts for the Houston facility for 12 months ($10,000 \u00d7 12).\nOption D is incorrect as it only accounts for the Beijing facility for 12 months ($11,000 \u00d7 12)."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "791519_2012.htm", "docs_id": "791519", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.

In structured finance, higher interest rates typically correspond to higher risk and longer maturity. The Class A-4 Notes offer the highest interest rate at 4.03%, which suggests they likely have the longest maturity and/or highest risk profile among the four classes.
