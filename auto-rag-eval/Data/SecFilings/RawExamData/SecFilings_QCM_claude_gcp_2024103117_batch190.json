The information provided indicates a complex lease arrangement. Future Property Limited (the building owner) has a five-year lease with United Power, Inc. United Power, Inc. then subleased space to the Registrant for five years. However, the key detail is that United Power, Inc., as the overtenant, has two additional five-year options to renew its lease with Future Property Limited. This means that if United exercises both options, its lease (and potentially the Registrant's sublease) could extend up to 15 years (5 + 5 + 5). While the Registrant's current sublease is for 5 years, the potential exists for it to be extended if United renews its lease with Future.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Registrant does not have a direct lease with Future Property Limited. \nOption C is incorrect because while the current sublease is for 5 years, there's a possibility of extension based on United's options.\nOption D is incorrect because the renewal options are granted to United Power, Inc., not directly to the Registrant."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "889609_2003.txt", "docs_id": "889609", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
