The key points are:\n\n1. The company has 12 total facilities, 10 owned and 2 leased.\n2. The total production space is about 2 million square feet.\n3. The leased facilities are in Maryland and Florida.\n\nGiven that the majority of facilities (10 out of 12) are owned, it's reasonable to assume that the leased facilities are not significantly larger than the owned ones. In fact, they may be smaller, as companies often own their primary facilities and lease smaller or temporary spaces.\n\nIf we assume an even distribution of space, each facility would account for about 8.33% of the total space (100% / 12). However, since the leased facilities are likely smaller, their combined share is probably less than this.\n\nTherefore, the loss of the two leased facilities is unlikely to result in a 20% decrease in capacity (ruling out A). It's also not severe enough to require immediate building of new facilities (ruling out B) or force significant outsourcing (ruling out D).\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the loss of these two facilities will have a relatively small impact on overall capacity, probably less than 5%, making C the correct answer.
