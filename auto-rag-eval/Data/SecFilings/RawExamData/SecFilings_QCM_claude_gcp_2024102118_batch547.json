Additionally, it mentions that they \"own or lease\" their transmitter and antenna sites, indicating a mix of ownership and leasing for these facilities.\n\nA) This is incorrect because while they own many properties, they don't own all of them.

The company owns 25 of its 28 locations, not leases them. The 1.7 to 3.9 years range refers to the lease terms for the 3 locations they don't own.\n\nD) This is incorrect because the company doesn't lease all transmitter and antenna sites.

It has the largest total square footage at approximately 16,500 square feet.\n2. It's located on El Camino Real, which is typically a major thoroughfare, potentially offering better visibility and access.\n3. Being a two-story building, it already has a multi-use layout that could be adapted for various purposes.\n4. The property is described first in the documentation, which might indicate its importance to the Company.\n\nWhile the other properties have merits, they are smaller in size and may not offer the same development potential. The Paso Robles office, despite having a basement, has less total usable space. The Arroyo Grande and Santa Maria offices, while also two-story buildings, are significantly smaller than the Atascadero location.\n\nThis question requires candidates to analyze and compare multiple factors across different properties, making it a challenging task that tests their ability to evaluate real estate potential from limited information."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1029932_1998.txt", "docs_id": "1029932", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
