The documentation states that the company leases approximately 32,000 square feet of office space and research facilities in Foster City, California through the second quarter of 2004. It also mentions that the company owns approximately 50,000 combined square feet in two facilities near Cardiff, United Kingdom.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases its U.S. facilities and owns facilities in Europe, not the other way around.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the company does lease 13,400 square feet in Indianapolis, this is not their largest leased facility.
