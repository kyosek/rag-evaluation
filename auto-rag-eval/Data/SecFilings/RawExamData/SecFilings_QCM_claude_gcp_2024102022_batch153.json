The corporate office lease rate is approximately $11.00 per square foot, which is already the lowest rate mentioned in the document. Renewing at this rate would not result in further cost reduction.\n\nB) Incorrect. While subleasing non-operating locations could offset some costs, these locations have the highest rental rates ($33.00 to $57.00 per square foot) and represent only 6 properties. Subleasing them would not likely result in the most significant overall reduction.\n\nC) Correct. The corporate office is the largest single property at 38,130 square feet, currently leased at $11.00 per square foot. Pie Five Units have lease rates ranging from $18.00 to $42.00 per square foot for much smaller spaces (1,765 to 4,634 square feet). By relocating the corporate office to a Pie Five Unit-sized location, the company could potentially reduce its total square footage significantly, resulting in the largest overall cost reduction despite a higher per-square-foot rate.\n\nD) Incorrect. While terminating Pizza Inn Buffet Unit leases might reduce some costs, there is only one such unit mentioned, and its specific lease rate is not provided.
