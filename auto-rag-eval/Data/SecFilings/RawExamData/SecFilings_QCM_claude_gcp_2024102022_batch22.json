The \"safe harbor\" provision, created by Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 21E of the Exchange Act, offers limited legal protection for forward-looking statements. This protection is designed to encourage companies to provide investors with information about future plans and projections without fear of litigation if those projections don't materialize, as long as the statements were made in good faith.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the protection is not absolute; companies can still face legal action if statements were made in bad faith or without reasonable basis.\n\nOption B is overly broad and mischaracterizes the purpose of the safe harbor provision.
