Given that the initial base terms of these leases range from 15 to 25 years, with options to extend for up to an additional 20 years, and assuming the company does not believe the renewal options are reasonably assured at inception, what is the maximum possible total lease term the company should consider for accounting purposes if it were to sign new leases for all locations today?\n\nA) 25 years\nB) 35 years\nC) 45 years\nD) 65 years\n\nCorrect Answer: A) 25 years\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of lease term consideration in accounting. The key information is that the company does not believe the renewal options are reasonably assured at inception, and therefore only considers the initial base term as the lease term. The initial base terms range from 15 to 25 years. Since we're asked for the maximum possible total lease term, we should consider the upper limit of this range, which is 25 years. The additional 20-year extension option is not considered part of the lease term for accounting purposes under these circumstances. Therefore, the maximum lease term the company would consider is 25 years, even if some leases have longer potential extensions."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "1162283_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1162283", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 1.
