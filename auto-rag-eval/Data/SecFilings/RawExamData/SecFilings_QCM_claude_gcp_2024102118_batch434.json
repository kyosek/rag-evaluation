This gives us (21.1 + 16.4 + 15.0) / 3 = $17.5 million.\n\nFor the estimated average annual future minimum rental charges, we're given a total of $137.7 million, but not the time period.

Assuming the information is from 2013 (as they mention potentially opening new offices in 2013), this gives us a period of about 11 years (2013-2024).

The rates have consistently improved from 87.60% in 1992 to 91.70% in 1996, with rates remaining above 90% since 1994. This overall positive trend suggests that the property's performance is improving, which would likely continue up to 2003. Waiting until 2003 to refinance would allow the Partnership to potentially negotiate better terms based on the property's improved performance and higher occupancy rates.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there was a slight decline from 1995 to 1996, the overall trend is positive, and immediate refinancing might not offer the best terms.\n\nOption C is too drastic given the property's generally improving performance and doesn't consider the potential for further improvement up to 2003.\n\nOption D, while conservative, may not be the most strategic use of the property's cash flow, especially if refinancing terms in 2003 could be favorable based on the property's performance."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1020710_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1020710", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.

The company owns its headquarters in Houston and the MRO segment owns or leases 48 service center facilities, while the Electrical Contractor segment owns one facility. This accounts for at least 49 owned service centers. Additionally, the document mentions leased facilities with terms ranging from one to five years, renewable options, and specified rental payments. Option A is incorrect because it states the company owns all 48 facilities, which contradicts the \"owns or leases\" statement.
