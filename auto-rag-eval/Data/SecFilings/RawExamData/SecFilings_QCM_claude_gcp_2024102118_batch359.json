The Partnership leases the 15.7 acres of land from General Electric, owns a 2.1 mile pipeline, and has entered into a lease arrangement with the Town of Bethlehem Industrial Development Agency (IDA). This arrangement exempts the Partnership from certain taxes, including some mortgage recording taxes, state and local real property taxes, and sales and use taxes in New York State.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Partnership leases the land from General Electric, not owns it. Also, General Electric granted the easements to the Partnership, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the IDA does not own the Facility, and the tax exemptions are only for certain taxes, not all state and local taxes.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it reverses the ownership and lease arrangements.
