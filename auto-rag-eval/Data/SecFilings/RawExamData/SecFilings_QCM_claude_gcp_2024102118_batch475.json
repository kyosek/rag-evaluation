This means about 22,000 sq ft (2/3 of 33,000) is currently used for manufacturing and warehousing in the owned building.\n\nThe leased warehouse space is 43,000 sq ft.\n\nTo maintain the same warehousing capacity after cancelling the lease, the company would need to fit 43,000 sq ft of warehouse space into the owned 33,000 sq ft building.\n\n43,000 / 33,000 = 1.30303 or about 130% of the entire owned building.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of the owned building's space, not the entire building. Since 130% is more than 100% of the building, we know the correct answer must be higher than 130%.\n\nTo calculate the correct percentage:\n43,000 / 33,000 * 100 = 130.30%\n130.30% + 66% (the original two-thirds used for manufacturing/warehousing) = 196.30%\n\nTherefore, 196% of the owned building's space would need to be dedicated to warehousing, which is closest to answer C."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "901038_1996.txt", "docs_id": "901038", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.
