The company owns its cable distribution plant and equipment, as stated in the first sentence. It also generally owns the towers on which its equipment is located, as mentioned in the third paragraph. The document indicates that cable plant is attached to utility poles under rental agreements, and that the company leases some parcels of land for headend and tower locations.
