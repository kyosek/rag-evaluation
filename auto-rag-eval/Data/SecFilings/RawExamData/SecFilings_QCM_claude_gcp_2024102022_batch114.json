To calculate the annual rent per square foot:\n\nAnnual rent = $33,500 * 12 = $402,000\nAnnual rent per square foot = $402,000 / 120,000 = $3.35\n\nThe documentation states that the facility can support sales levels of approximately $220 million at current pricing levels, and given the current level of sales, they are operating the facility at approximately 35% of overall capacity.\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately represents both the annual rent per square foot ($3.35) and the current utilization of sales capacity (35%).\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they misstate either the rent per square foot or the capacity utilization.\n\nOption D has the correct capacity utilization but an incorrect rent per square foot calculation."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1552946_2013.htm", "docs_id": "1552946", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "ITEM 8.
