This explanation is supported by the following reasons:\n\n1. The question states that the REIT owns 14 retail properties, but it doesn't specify if this number changed from 2012 to 2013.

Option B (selling underperforming properties) is less likely because it would require selling a significant portion of the portfolio to have such a large impact on the average rent.\n\n3. Option C (existing tenants renewing at higher rates) is possible but unlikely to cause such a large increase in just one year across the entire portfolio.\n\n4. Option D (reducing total square footage) is unlikely because it would typically be mentioned in the documentation if there was a significant reduction in the portfolio's size.\n\nThe acquisition of new properties with higher rental rates is a common strategy for REITs to grow their portfolio and increase their average rental income, making it the most plausible explanation for the observed increase in annualized base rent per square foot."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "1474439_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1474439", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.
