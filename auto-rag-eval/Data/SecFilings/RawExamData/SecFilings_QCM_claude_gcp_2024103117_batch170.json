Carsen's lease in Markham, Ontario:\n   This lease expires in July 2000. Without renewal, it won't be active in August 2000.\n\n2. MediVators' lease in Eagan, Minnesota:\n   This lease expires on September 30, 2001, so it will be active in August 2000.\n   The monthly base rent for \"next year\" is $13,000.\n\n3. Executive offices in Clifton, New Jersey:\n   This lease expires in January 2000, so it won't be active in August 2000 without renewal.\n\nTherefore, in August 2000, only the MediVators lease will be active, with a monthly base rent of $13,000.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"total monthly base rent,\" which implies we should include all active leases. Since the company states \"The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs,\" we can assume they would renew the executive office lease in Clifton, NJ.\n\nSo, the total monthly base rent in August 2000 would be:\n$13,000 (MediVators) + $3,500 (Executive offices) = $16,500\n\nThis makes B) $16,500 the correct answer."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "1178862_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1178862", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.
