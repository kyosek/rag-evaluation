The US facility is 2,479 square feet in Cambridge, MA, with a lease expiring in May 2022 and an option to extend for two years. The Belgian facility was originally 1,577 square meters, but in January 2021, the company entered an agreement to extend the lease from February 2021 to January 2030 and add 201 square meters of space. This brings the total Belgian space to 1,778 square meters (1,577 + 201). The question asks for the total space as of February 1, 2021, which is when the new Belgian lease took effect. Therefore, the correct total space is 2,479 square feet (US) and 1,778 square meters (Belgium). Options A and B are incorrect because they mix units or have incorrect total areas.
