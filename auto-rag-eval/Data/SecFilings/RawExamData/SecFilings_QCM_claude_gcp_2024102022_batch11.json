The total square footage of all mentioned facilities is 51,289 (Fremont) + 4,294 (Tokyo) = 55,583 sq ft.\n2. The annual rental payments for all facilities is given as approximately $927,000.\n3. We need to calculate the proportion of the rent that's likely attributable to the Fremont facility.\n4. The Fremont facility represents 51,289 / 55,583 = 92.3% of the total square footage.\n5. Assuming rent is proportional to square footage, the Fremont facility's rent would be approximately 92.3% of $927,000.\n6. This calculation is: (51,289 / 55,583 * $927,000) = $855,706\n\nOption A is incorrect as it's the total rent for all facilities. Option B is a plausible but incorrect guess.
