While the total square footage in options A and C is correct (61,000 sq ft), the expiration dates are incorrect.\n\nThe correct expiration dates are:\nCorporate headquarters: April 2011\nU.S. fulfillment center: October 2011\nIreland fulfillment center: December 2011\n\nThe earliest expiration date is April 2011 for the corporate headquarters. Therefore, the correct answer is D, which provides the correct total square footage (51,000 sq ft) and identifies the corporate headquarters as having the earliest lease expiration date (April 2011)."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1653876_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1653876", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.
