Based on these actions and the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The company's strategy demonstrates poor financial management, as they paid $1 million to terminate a lease only to immediately enter into a new lease agreement.\n\nB) The company's actions show a clear long-term real estate strategy, as evidenced by the substantial savings from early lease termination and the flexibility of the new sublease agreement.\n\nC) The company's decision to terminate the TIAA lease was financially sound, but the subsequent Redmond sublease indicates a lack of coherent property management planning.\n\nD) The company's property decisions reflect a shift towards more flexible, short-term commitments, potentially in response to changing business needs or market conditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The company's actions demonstrate a clear shift towards more flexible, short-term property commitments. This is evidenced by:\n\n1. Terminating a long-term lease obligation (extending through 2007) with TIAA, despite having to pay a $1 million fee. This saved the company over $5 million in future lease obligations.\n\n2. Entering into a sublease agreement in Redmond with very flexible terms, including the ability to terminate with just 30 days' notice.\n\n3. Providing notice to terminate the Redmond sublease after only a few months and planning to secure office space on a monthly rental basis.\n\nThese actions suggest the company is prioritizing flexibility and short-term commitments in its property decisions, likely in response to changing business needs or market conditions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company did pay to terminate one lease and enter another, the new lease was much more flexible and the termination saved significant money long-term.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while there were financial benefits to the decisions, the rapid changes in leasing strategy do not indicate a clear long-term real estate strategy.\n\nAnswer C is partially correct about the TIAA lease termination being financially sound, but it fails to recognize the strategic flexibility gained through the subsequent property decisions."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1351667_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1351667", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.

Old Republic Building: 151,000 sq ft, 50% occupied = 75,500 sq ft\n2. Title Insurance Group HQ: 110,000 sq ft, 65% occupied = 71,500 sq ft\n3. Eleven smaller buildings: We don't have the exact size, but we assume they're fully occupied by Old Republic.\n\nTotal known space: 151,000 + 110,000 = 261,000 sq ft\nSpace occupied by Old Republic: 75,500 + 71,500 = 147,000 sq ft\n\nPercentage occupied: 147,000 / 261,000 = 0.5632 or 56.32%\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for the eleven smaller buildings. Since we don't know their size, we need to estimate. If we assume these buildings add about 10% to the total space and are fully occupied, we get:\n\nTotal space including smaller buildings: 261,000 * 1.1 = 287,100 sq ft\nTotal occupied space: 147,000 + (261,000 * 0.1) = 173,100 sq ft\n\nFinal percentage: 173,100 / 287,100 = 0.6027 or 60.27%\n\nThe closest answer to this is 62.7%, which accounts for potential variations in the size of the smaller buildings.\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading, making assumptions about unknown data, and performing multiple calculations."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1092367_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1092367", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.
