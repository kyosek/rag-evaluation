The correct answer of approximately $402,000 suggests that these additional costs amount to about $422,540 annually ($402,000 + $20,540).\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading, inference, and multiple calculations to arrive at the correct answer."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "883902_2016.htm", "docs_id": "883902", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.
