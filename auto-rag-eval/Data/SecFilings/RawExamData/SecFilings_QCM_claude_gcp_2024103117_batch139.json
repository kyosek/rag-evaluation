Additionally, the company acquired ASBI through a pooling-of-interests transaction. How would these events impact the company's financial statements and reporting?\n\nA) The stock dividends would increase total shareholders' equity, while the ASBI acquisition would be reported as a purchase transaction.\n\nB) Both stock dividends would require retroactive adjustment of earnings per share, and the ASBI acquisition would be reflected as a combination of historical financial information.\n\nC) Only the August 1, 2000 stock dividend would affect prior period reporting, and the ASBI acquisition would be treated as a subsidiary investment.\n\nD) Neither stock dividend would impact previously reported financial data, but the ASBI acquisition would require a restatement of prior period financial statements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Stock dividends of 10% or more are typically considered large enough to require retroactive adjustment of earnings per share and other per-share data for all periods presented. This is evidenced by the notes indicating adjustments for both the August 1, 2000, and May 3, 2001 stock dividends. \n\nAdditionally, the acquisition of ASBI is specifically mentioned as being accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. In a pooling-of-interests (which was an acceptable method during the time period referenced in this document), the financial statements of the combined entities are presented as if they had always been a single company. This requires a restatement of prior period financial information to include the results of both companies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because stock dividends don't increase total shareholders' equity, and the ASBI acquisition was not a purchase transaction. Option C is incorrect because both stock dividends would affect prior period reporting, not just the earlier one. Option D is incorrect because both stock dividends do impact previously reported data, particularly per-share amounts."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1179351_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1179351", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.

The term of the lease was five years and it commenced on August 1, 2007. Monthly rent for the first year of tenancy was $3,500.
