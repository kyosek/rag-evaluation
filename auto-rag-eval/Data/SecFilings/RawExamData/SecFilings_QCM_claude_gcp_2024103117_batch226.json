The documentation states that Vail Banks is \"currently in the design phase for a new facility in Glenwood Springs to replace an existing branch office.\" Additionally, it mentions that Vail Banks \"leased three properties previously occupied by WestStar branches\" and is making plans to \"either terminate these leases or find tenants to sublease the properties.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because Vail Banks doesn't own all 23 properties (it owns 14 and leases 9), and there's no mention of selling the vacant Glenwood Springs facility.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Vail Banks is not planning to continue the WestStar leases until 2028. The document states these leases expire between 2005 and 2006, and the company is looking to terminate or sublease them.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the ownership and lease numbers are correct, there's no mention of plans to encumber the owned properties for financing.
