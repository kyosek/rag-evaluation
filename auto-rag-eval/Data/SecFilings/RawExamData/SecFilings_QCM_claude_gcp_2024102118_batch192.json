The total monthly lease payments would be $22,290 ($13,507 + $1,500 + $3,491 + $3,792), but this is not true as of January 1, 2018, because the month-to-month lease expires on December 31, 2017.\n\nB) Incorrect. The principal executive offices lease expires in June 2018, which is not the longest remaining term. The lease described in point (3) expires in August 2019, which is later.\n\nC) Incorrect. While most leases will expire within 18 months, the lease described in point (3) expires in August 2019, which is more than 18 months from January 1, 2018.\n\nD) Correct.

In this case, while the company has effectively satisfied the debt obligation, accounting standards typically require the company to remove the liability from its balance sheet but disclose the outstanding defeased debt in the notes to the financial statements. This approach balances the economic reality of the transaction with transparency in financial reporting. Option A is incorrect because immediate removal without disclosure is not typically allowed.

The lease was renewed in November 2002 for five years with annual payments of $82,000, adjusted for cost of living increases. The company had an option to purchase the building, which increased in price over time. If the company exercised its option to purchase in November 2007, how long after the initial option became available did they wait to buy the building?\n\nA) 4 years\nB) 6 years\nC) 10 years\nD) 11 years\n\nCorrect Answer: C) 10 years\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that the company had an option to purchase the building for $1,000,000 upon 60 days notice for six years beginning December 5, 1997. After that, the purchase price increased by $50,000 each year, and the option expired at the end of the tenth year. The company exercised its option to purchase the building in November 2007 for $1,200,000.\n\nTo calculate the time:\n1. Initial option date: December 5, 1997\n2. Purchase date: November 2007\n3. Time difference: Approximately 10 years\n\nThe purchase price of $1,200,000 also confirms this timeline:\n$1,000,000 (initial price) + ($50,000 x 4 years) = $1,200,000\n\nTherefore, the company waited 10 years after the initial option became available to purchase the building."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1004155_1996.txt", "docs_id": "1004155", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "Item 2.
