In October and November 2009 the Company moved its operations to this facility. Total rent expense for fiscal 2009 was $168,000 and for fiscal 2010 was $236,872.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. Corporate offices: No monthly rent (excluded from calculation)\n2. Dallas operations center: $3,700 per month\n3.
