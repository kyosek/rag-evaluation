The company has two New York locations:\n   - 1115 Broadway: 31,000 sq ft, $1,109,000 annual rent\n   - 180 Madison Ave: 3,000 sq ft, $90,000 annual rent\n\n2. To consolidate, the company would need to fit all New York operations (34,000 sq ft total) into one location.\n\n3. The 180 Madison Ave. location is too small, so the only viable option is 1115 Broadway.\n\n4. By moving all operations to 1115 Broadway, the company would no longer need to pay rent for 180 Madison Ave.\n\n5. This would result in savings of $90,000 annually (the rent for 180 Madison Ave.).\n\n6. The total savings would be $1,109,000 + $90,000 = $1,199,000.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct. The company could save approximately $1,199,000 in annual rent by consolidating operations into the 1115 Broadway location (which is effectively the same as saying they save this amount by eliminating the 180 Madison Ave. location)."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "914537_1999.txt", "docs_id": "914537", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

Consider the sales representatives:\n   The document states there are 2,101 sales representatives.\n\nSince the number of sales representatives (2,101) matches the number of employees not accounted for in the main offices or as field managers, we can deduce that almost all of these employees work outside the main office locations.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"most accurate estimate,\" and it's unlikely that every single sales representative works outside the main offices.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the Company's current property situation and operational strategy?\n\nA) The Company owns all of its branch offices and leases only its principal office in Raleigh.\n\nB) The Company's operations center is located in Raleigh, where it processes all data and bank items.\n\nC) The Company leases 28 properties across North Carolina, with plans to vacate one mortgage office by March 31, 2008.\n\nD) The Company owns 17 branch office properties, leases its principal office, and consolidated its statewide operations to an in-house processing center in Burlington.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is the most accurate and comprehensive statement based on the information provided. The documentation states that the Company owns 17 properties used as branch offices throughout North Carolina. It also mentions that the Company leases its principal office space in Raleigh. Furthermore, it explicitly states that the Company completed the consolidation of its statewide operations during the first quarter of 2006 and now processes data and bank items in-house at the operations center located in one of the Burlington offices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company does not own all of its branch offices; it leases 11 properties used as branch offices in addition to the 17 it owns.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the operations center is specifically mentioned to be in Burlington, not Raleigh.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misrepresents the number of leased properties. The Company leases 12 properties (11 branch offices plus the principal office), not 28. While it's true that one mortgage office in Holly Springs will be vacated, this doesn't justify the larger error in the number of leased properties."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "715446_2012.htm", "docs_id": "715446", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 1.
