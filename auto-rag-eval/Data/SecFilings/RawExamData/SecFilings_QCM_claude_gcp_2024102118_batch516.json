The documentation states that as of December 31, 2017, Herc owned approximately 11% of its locations, which means about 89% are leased. It also specifies that these leases are typically triple net leases, where Herc is responsible for ongoing expenses including real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance, in addition to rent and utilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Herc owns only about 11% of its locations, not the majority.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the leases are described as triple net leases, not standard commercial leases where the landlord would be responsible for those expenses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that the rental locations are generally located in industrial or commercial zones, not residential areas.\n\nThis question tests the examinee's ability to carefully read and interpret complex real estate and operational information, requiring them to synthesize multiple pieces of data to arrive at the correct conclusion."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1790982_2019.htm", "docs_id": "1790982", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "Item 2.

The company currently utilizes 25,928 square feet as its main office, and the remainder is either leased to third parties or vacant. This means the maximum available space for immediate use would be the total square footage minus the space already used by the company: 65,880 - 25,928 = 39,952 square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes all space in the building is available, which is not the case.\nOption C is incorrect because the leased space is not owned by the company and its lease is expiring in May 2015, so it's not part of the property being considered for purchase.\nOption D is incorrect for the same reason as C, and it only considers the leased space, not the owned corporate headquarters."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "879181_1998.txt", "docs_id": "879181", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
