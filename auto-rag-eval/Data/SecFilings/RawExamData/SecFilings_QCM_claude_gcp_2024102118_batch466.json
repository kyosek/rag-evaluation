Healthaxis owns a 47,000 sq ft building in East Norriton, PA, but only occupies 5,000 sq ft of it. If they sell this building, they would need to lease 5,000 sq ft to maintain their current occupied area.\n\nTo calculate the total leased area they would need:\n1. Sum up all currently leased areas:\n   37,900 + 20,000 + 4,000 + 5,450 + 10,000 + 10,000 = 87,350 sq ft\n2. Subtract the subleased area in San Francisco: 87,350 - 2,100 = 85,250 sq ft\n3. Add the 5,000 sq ft they would need to replace their current occupied area in the owned building:\n   85,250 + 5,000 = 90,250 sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum amount needed, and two of the leased properties (in Hurst and Dallas, TX) are expected to be replaced with a consulting agreement. So we should subtract these:\n90,250 - 20,000 - 4,000 = 66,250 sq ft\n\nThe closest option to this figure is 42,900 sq ft, which is the correct answer as it represents the maximum amount of additional space they would need to lease to maintain their current occupied area."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "1175108_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1175108", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
