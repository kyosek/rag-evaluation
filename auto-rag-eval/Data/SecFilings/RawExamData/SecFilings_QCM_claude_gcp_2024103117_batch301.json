Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's real estate strategy and operations?\n\nA) The company's primary research and development activities are conducted at the Alachua facility, which is larger and has a longer lease term than the Cambridge location.\n\nB) The Cambridge facility focuses mainly on business development and basic research, while the Alachua location serves primarily as corporate headquarters.\n\nC) Both facilities have similar square footage and lease terms, indicating an equal distribution of resources and activities between the two locations.\n\nD) The company has shown a pattern of rapid expansion, with both facilities more than doubling in size within a year of the initial lease signing.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation clearly states that the Alachua, Florida facility serves as the corporate headquarters, consisting of 21,500 square feet of laboratory and office space. In contrast, the Cambridge, Massachusetts facility is described as primarily focusing on business development, pharmacology, and basic research and development, occupying a smaller space of approximately 8,000 square feet after an expansion.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the Alachua facility is indeed larger and has a longer initial lease term, the documentation doesn't specify that it's the primary location for research and development.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the facilities have significantly different square footages (21,500 vs. 8,000) and lease terms (12 years vs. 7 years).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Cambridge facility did expand, it was not a doubling in size within a year. The Alachua facility doesn't mention any expansion in the given information."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "313151_1995.txt", "docs_id": "313151", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "Item 2.
