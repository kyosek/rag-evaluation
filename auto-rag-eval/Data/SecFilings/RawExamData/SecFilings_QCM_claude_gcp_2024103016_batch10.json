The San Francisco executive office lease is $300 per month, but this is not the most expensive lease. Several Global Hotline properties in Japan have much higher monthly payments.\nB) Correct. The sum of all monthly lease payments for Global Hotline properties in Japan (Tokyo and Osaka) is $238,717.
