The documentation explicitly states, \"The Company is currently renovating its facility in O'Hara Township in order to increase production capacity and improve efficiencies for existing product lines as well as provide space to integrate future acquisitions. It is expected that renovations will continue through fiscal 2009.\" This directly corresponds to option B, which accurately captures the reasons for renovation and the expected timeline.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions reducing production capacity, which is the opposite of what's stated, and provides an incorrect completion date.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the document mentions facility ages ranging up to 100 years, it doesn't specify the O'Hara Township facility as being 100 years old or that the renovation is specifically to modernize its age.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although the document mentions the possibility of adding shifts to increase capacity, this is not stated as a reason for the O'Hara Township renovation.

How would this likely impact the company's financial statements and what additional information might an investor seek to properly assess the company's financial health?\n\nA) It would only affect the balance sheet by reducing assets, with no impact on the income statement. An investor should focus solely on the next quarter's revenue growth.\n\nB) It would result in a significant operating loss for the quarter, potentially leading to a net loss. An investor should investigate the reasons for the impairment and assess if it's an isolated event or indicative of ongoing issues.\n\nC) It would be recorded as an extraordinary item below the operating income line, with minimal impact on core operations. An investor should disregard this one-time event entirely.\n\nD) It would increase the company's operating income by $84.5 million as it's a non-cash charge. An investor should view this positively as it improves cash flow.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because a large impairment charge directly affects the operating loss as stated in the documentation. This would likely result in a significant operating loss for the quarter and could lead to a net loss depending on other factors. An impairment of this magnitude is a serious event that investors should investigate further. They should try to understand the reasons behind the impairment, whether it's due to changing market conditions, obsolete technology, or other factors. It's crucial to determine if this is an isolated event or if it points to ongoing challenges the company faces. This approach provides a more comprehensive view of the company's financial health and future prospects.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the impairment would affect both the balance sheet and income statement. Option C is wrong because impairments are typically included in operating expenses, not as extraordinary items. Option D is incorrect as an impairment charge would decrease, not increase, operating income."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "30625_2006.htm", "docs_id": "30625", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES.\nOur corporate headquarters is a leased facility located in Irving, Texas, which we began to occupy on January 1, 2004.
