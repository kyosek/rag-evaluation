The documentation states that \"As of January 30, 2012, 21 of 41 of the Company's restaurant facilities were leased.\" This means that 21 restaurants were leased, and the remaining 20 were owned. To calculate the percentage owned:\n\n20 / 41 = 0.4878 or 48.78%\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage owned, so we need to round this to 51.2% (as 48.8% would be the percentage leased).\n\nFor the second part of the question, the document states \"The leases expire on dates ranging from 2012 to 2035.\" Therefore, the latest possible year that one of their current leases could expire is 2035.\n\nOnly option C correctly combines both of these pieces of information."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "1157972_2001.htm", "docs_id": "1157972", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.
