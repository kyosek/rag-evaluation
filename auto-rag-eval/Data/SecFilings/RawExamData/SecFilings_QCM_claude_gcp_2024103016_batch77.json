First, the bank has 10 locations total (including the main office), not 10 branches. Second, the majority of locations are in Holmes County, not Knox County.\n\nC is incorrect because $5.5 million is the net book value of the bank's office property and equipment, not the total investment. The total investment is stated as $11.1 million.\n\nD is correct. The document states that the bank has seven offices in Holmes County, two in Knox County, and one in Tuscarawas County.
