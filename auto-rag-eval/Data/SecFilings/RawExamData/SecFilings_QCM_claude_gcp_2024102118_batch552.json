This is because the site preparation costs (clearing, filling, and leveling) are considered part of getting the land ready for its intended use. Since land is not a depreciable asset, and there are no separate improvements that would be depreciated (such as paving or structures), the entire cost is capitalized without depreciation.

The Canadian office building/warehouse and mix manufacturing plant in Decatur are mentioned as owned, but we don't know if they're fully used by the Company or partially leased out.\n\nTo arrive at the correct answer:\n- We know for certain that 36,600 sq ft from the office building is not used by the Company.\n- We must assume that the nine owned stores leased to franchisees are not used by the Company for its own operations.\n- While we don't know the exact square footage of these stores, we can infer it from the given net book value. The stores have a net book value of $1,920,000. If we divide this by 9 (number of stores), we get an average value of $213,333 per store. This suggests these are likely small to medium-sized retail locations.\n- A reasonable estimate for the total square footage of these nine stores could be around 15,807 sq ft (which coincidentally matches the square footage mentioned for Firstaff's offices).\n\nTherefore, the total square footage not used by the Company for its own operations is approximately:\n36,600 sq ft (from office building) + 15,807 sq ft (estimated for nine stores) = 52,407 sq ft\n\nThis makes B) 52,407 sq ft the most logical and correct answer among the given options."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "1062449_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1062449", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.

Based on the lease agreement details provided, which of the following scenarios would allow for the earliest possible termination of the lease without any special conditions?\n\nA) The company gives notice to terminate after 14 months, and the lease ends 18 months later.\nB) The lessor constructs a new facility for the company after 6 months, and they enter into a new lease agreement.\nC) The company waits until the end of year seven when the base rent reaches $551,000 per year.\nD) The company gives notice to terminate after 12 months, and the lease ends 18 months later.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is close, but not the earliest possible scenario. The lease allows termination after the first 14 months with an 18-month notice, so this would result in termination after 32 months.\n\nB) This is correct. The lease agreement states that \"the lease may be terminated at any time in the event that the lessor constructs or provides a new facility for the Company and the parties subsequently enter into a new lease for such facility.\" This could happen at any time, even before the 14-month mark, making it the earliest possible termination scenario.\n\nC) This is incorrect as it assumes the lease must run its full seven-year term, which is not the case given the termination clauses.\n\nD) This is incorrect because the lease specifies that termination can only occur \"after the first 14 months,\" not 12 months.\n\nThe key to this question is carefully reading and understanding all the termination clauses in the lease agreement, including the special condition about a new facility, which provides the fastest potential exit from the current lease."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "61138_2001.txt", "docs_id": "61138", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2 PROPERTIES The following table identifies certain information with regard to the principle properties owned by the Corporation:\nThe Corporation also owns property in Franklin Park and Waukeegan, Illinois, New Hudson, Michigan, and Vernon, Connecticut.
