For the third building (39,000 square feet), the Company entered into a 10-year lease, but it's owned by a limited liability company of which the Company owns 91.5%. This arrangement demonstrates that the Company sold and leased back two buildings while partially owning the third through a separate entity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company doesn't own all three buildings outright. Option B is incorrect because while it does lease two buildings from SPEC, it doesn't own the third building outright, but rather has a majority stake in the LLC that owns it.

This means the total number of theatres was 527 (468 + 59).
