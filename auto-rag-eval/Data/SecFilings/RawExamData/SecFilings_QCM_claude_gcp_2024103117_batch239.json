This was done \"in order to drive company-wide savings.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because Ultratech was actually reducing its presence in the UK and Texas, not expanding.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no mention of renewing all existing U.S. leases.

This extensive international operation suggests a strong global footprint, which can bring benefits such as market diversification and access to different resources. However, it also implies potential risks such as currency exchange fluctuations when dealing with multiple currencies and geopolitical challenges that can arise from operating in various countries with different political and economic systems.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the statement clearly indicates a presence beyond North America, including Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.
