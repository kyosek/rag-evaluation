Key points supporting this answer include:\n\n1. The document states that Globe \"leases space for all of its store and warehouse operations under operating leases expiring at various times through 2004.\"\n2.

The company leases its corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, with an option to terminate in 2017.\n2. The company owns three manufacturing sites: Wilmington, Ohio (195,000 sq ft), Athlone, Ireland (460,000 sq ft), and Gainesville, Georgia (90,000 sq ft), which indeed total approximately 745,000 square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Wilmington is not the largest manufacturing space (Athlone is), and while the Waltham lease can be extended, it's for two five-year periods, not 10 years total.\n\nOption B is partially correct about Athlone being the largest owned facility, but incorrectly states there are no extension options for the Chelsea sublease (there are two five-year extension options).\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Chelsea facility is being sub-let, not available for immediate expansion, and the Waltham lease does have extension options."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "33565_1993.txt", "docs_id": "33565", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1993", "text": "Item 8.
