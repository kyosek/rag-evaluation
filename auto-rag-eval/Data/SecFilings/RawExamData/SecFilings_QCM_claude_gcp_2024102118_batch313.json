The rental expense has been increasing each year:\n   From 2000 to 2001: Increase of $2,229,000\n   From 2001 to 2002: Increase of $3,303,000\n\n2.

If we assume this trend continues, we would expect the rental expense for 2003 to be around:\n   $50,669,000 + $2,766,000 = $53,435,000\n\n4. However, we also need to factor in the new leases with a commitment of $21,301,000. Assuming these leases are spread over multiple years (typically 10 years as per the document), we might expect about 1/10 of this amount to impact the first year:\n   $21,301,000 / 10 \u2248 $2,130,000\n\n5. Adding this to our projected expense:\n   $53,435,000 + $2,130,000 = $55,565,000\n\nTherefore, the most likely range for the 2003 rental expense would be $54,000,000 - $56,000,000, which corresponds to option B."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "55805_2007.htm", "docs_id": "55805", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "ITEM 2.
