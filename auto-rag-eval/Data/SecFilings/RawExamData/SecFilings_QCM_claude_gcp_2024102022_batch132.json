The annual base rent is approximately $1.1 million\n\nIf Hot Topic exercises both renewal options, they would extend the lease for an additional 10 years (two 5-year terms) beyond 2014. \n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n$1.1 million per year * 15 years (5 years for the first renewal + 5 years for the second renewal + 5 years for the remainder of 2014 to 2019) = $16.5 million\n\nOption A ($5.5 million) represents only 5 years of rent.\nOption B ($11 million) represents 10 years of rent.\nOption D ($22 million) is an overestimation, possibly from miscounting the years or including the pre-2014 period."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1534675_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1534675", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.
