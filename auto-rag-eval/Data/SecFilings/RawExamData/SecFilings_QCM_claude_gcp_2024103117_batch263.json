What percentage of the company's 102 facilities are leased, and what strategic advantage might this provide?\n\nA) 17.6% are leased, potentially providing flexibility in market expansion and contraction\nB) 82.4% are leased, likely reducing capital expenditure requirements\nC) 17.6% are leased, probably increasing long-term occupancy costs\nD) 82.4% are leased, possibly limiting customization options for specialized storage needs\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The text states that out of 102 facilities, 18 are leased and the remaining 84 are company-owned. This means 17.6% (18/102) of the facilities are leased, which corresponds to option A. The strategic advantage of having a mix of owned and leased properties, with a smaller percentage being leased, is that it provides flexibility. The company can more easily expand or contract its presence in different markets by adjusting its leased properties, while maintaining a strong base of owned facilities. This approach balances the benefits of ownership (like long-term cost control and customization) with the flexibility of leasing. Options B and D are incorrect because they state that 82.4% are leased, which is the opposite of what the text indicates. Option C, while correctly stating the percentage of leased properties, suggests a disadvantage rather than a strategic benefit."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1437213_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1437213", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.
