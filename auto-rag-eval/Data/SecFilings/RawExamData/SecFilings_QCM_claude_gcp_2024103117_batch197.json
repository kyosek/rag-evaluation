Calculate the number of leased properties initially: 281 - 146 = 135\n2. Calculate the number of owned properties without mortgages: 146 - 17 = 129\n3. Calculate half of the sold properties to be leased back: 129 \u00f7 2 = 64.5 (round up to 65)\n4. Add the initial leased properties, the 17 mortgaged properties, and the leased-back properties: 135 + 17 + 65 = 217\n\nHowever, the question asks how many facilities would be leased, not the total number of facilities.
