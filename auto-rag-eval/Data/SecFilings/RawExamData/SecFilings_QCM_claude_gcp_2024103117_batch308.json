The New York City office has the largest space (17,000 sq ft) and houses the most personnel (100).\n2.

The lease for the New York City office expires in March 2010, which is further in the future compared to the Los Angeles office (December 2004).\n4. While the Draper, Utah office has a similar expiration date (April 2010), it has less space and fewer personnel, suggesting less room for growth.\n5. The Los Angeles office has a near-term expiration date (December 2004), making it less suitable for immediate expansion plans.\n6.
