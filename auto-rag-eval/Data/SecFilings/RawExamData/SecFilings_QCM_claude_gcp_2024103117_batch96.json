For the Carthage facility, while it's permitted to process 100 tons per day of healthcare-related waste, the actual processing capacity is the sum of the incinerator capacity (40 tons per day, with 10% or 4 tons for medical waste) and the autoclave capacity (8 tons per day), totaling 48 tons per day (4 + 8) for medical and healthcare-related waste."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1433269_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1433269", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "ITEM 2.

The company owns properties in Utah and Ireland, while leasing in Oregon. The text details a wide range of in-house capabilities including machining, plastics-forming, sensor production, assembly, testing, and packaging. Additionally, the company has R&D facilities and a global communications network. This comprehensive approach across multiple locations and countries reflects a vertically-integrated strategy with diverse in-house capabilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage indicates significant in-house manufacturing rather than outsourcing. Option B is wrong because UTMD operates in multiple locations, not just Utah.
