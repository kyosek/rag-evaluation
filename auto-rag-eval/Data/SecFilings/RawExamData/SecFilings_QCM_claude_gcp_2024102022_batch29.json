This is because a valuation allowance is typically set up when a company believes it may not be able to realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets, which results in an expense.\n\nCeasing to amortize goodwill as of December 31, 2001, in accordance with SFAS 142, would generally lead to an increase in net income in subsequent periods. This is because goodwill amortization is an expense that reduces net income. By stopping this amortization, the company would no longer incur this expense, thus potentially increasing net income.\n\nOption A correctly captures both of these effects: the immediate decrease in net income due to the tax valuation allowance charge, and the potential increase in net income in subsequent periods due to the cessation of goodwill amortization."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "40888_2017.htm", "docs_id": "40888", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.
