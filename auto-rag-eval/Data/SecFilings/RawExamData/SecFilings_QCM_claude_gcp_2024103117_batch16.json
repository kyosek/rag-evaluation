The company leases approximately 764,000 square feet in total (120,000 + 144,000 + 150,000 + 175,000 + 175,000 = 764,000 sq ft), considering the executive offices, Operations Center, two warehouse facilities in the U.S., and the European centralized warehouse. The European warehouse lease in Venray, Netherlands, expiring in June 2007, is indeed the latest expiration date mentioned.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the total square footage is wrong, and not all leases expire by the end of 2006 (the European warehouse lease goes until June 2007).\n\nOption C is incorrect because it only accounts for U.S. properties and mistakenly states that all U.S. leases expire by October 2006, when in fact the Memphis warehouse lease extends to August 2006.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the total square footage is wrong, and the Memphis warehouse lease is not the earliest to expire (it expires in August 2006, while others expire in February and June 2006)."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1177702_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1177702", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.
