Rentable square footage outside Hawaii = Total - Hawaii\n   34.9 million - 16.8 million = 18.1 million sq ft\n\n2.

The documentation states that Community has 25 branch offices in Georgia, Community-Alabama has 1 branch in Montgomery, Alabama, and Community-Troup has 2 branch offices (one in LaGrange, Georgia and one in Columbus, Georgia). This totals 28 branch offices. Additionally, the main office of Community-Troup in LaGrange is mentioned separately, bringing the total to 29 locations. The information also specifies that 15 of Community's branches are operated in supermarkets, and the branches of Community-Alabama and Community-Troup are also in supermarkets, supporting the statement that 15 of the total branches are in supermarkets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all branches are owned (only 5 are owned, 20 are leased) and not all are in standalone buildings (15 are in supermarkets).\n\nOption B is incorrect as Community-Alabama is stated to have only one branch in Montgomery, not three.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Financial Supermarkets is not described as operating the supermarket branches.
