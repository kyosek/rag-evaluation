The correct answer is D because the passage states that the \"Extensive underground gas storage facilities and equipment are located in an area in North St. Louis County extending under the Missouri River into St. Charles County.\" Additionally, the text mentions that \"All of the utility properties of Laclede Gas are held in fee or by easement or under lease agreements,\" and specifically notes that \"The principal lease agreements include underground storage rights that are of indefinite duration.\" This combination of information leads to the conclusion that these facilities are likely held through a mix of ownership types across the described geographic area."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "932696_2000.htm", "docs_id": "932696", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.
