The company's continued use of leased properties without formal new agreements, even while making payments, puts them at risk of lease termination or unfavorable terms during renegotiation. This is because they lack the legal protection of a formal lease agreement, which could allow the lessor to end the arrangement or demand significantly different terms when formalizing the lease.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate eviction is unlikely if the company is still making payments and negotiating.\n\nOption B is incorrect because trespassing typically involves unauthorized use, whereas the company is making payments and in negotiations, suggesting some level of permission.\n\nOption C is possible but less likely to be the primary risk, as unexpected rent increases would typically occur within the context of a formal lease renegotiation.\n\nOption D best captures the overall risk to the company's property rights and potential business disruption that could result from this uncertain lease situation."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "57055_2005.txt", "docs_id": "57055", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.
