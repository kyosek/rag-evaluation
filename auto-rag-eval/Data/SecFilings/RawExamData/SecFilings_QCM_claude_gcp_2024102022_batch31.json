In September 2003, Ironstone repurchased all of these shares. Such repurchased shares are currently being held as treasury stock.

The document states that Plant 2 has a rated capacity of 116,000 gst and Plant 3 has a rated capacity of 71,000 gst, totaling 187,000 gst.\n2.

Option B is incorrect because while Plant 2 does have higher capacity, reopening Plant 1 is not suggested as it was closed due to discontinued production and would require significant capital expenditures to modernize.\n4. Option C is incorrect because the practical capacity is not equal to the rated capacity, and it's not evenly split between the plants.\n5.

They are subleasing approximately 16,409 square feet of their El Segundo office to a KMC subsidiary, which will result in savings of about $1,550,000 over 40 months.\n2. They have listed approximately 10,000 square feet for lease in Kent, Washington.\n3.

What percentage of this space is dedicated to manufacturing and manufacturing support, and how does this compare to the company's new large-scale manufacturing facility completed in 2006?\n\nA) 42.8% of the leased space is for manufacturing and manufacturing support, which is approximately 37% larger than the new facility completed in 2006.\nB) 42.8% of the leased space is for manufacturing and manufacturing support, which is approximately 27% smaller than the new facility completed in 2006.\nC) 37.4% of the leased space is for manufacturing and manufacturing support, which is approximately 37% larger than the new facility completed in 2006.\nD) 37.4% of the leased space is for manufacturing and manufacturing support, which is approximately 27% smaller than the new facility completed in 2006.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The company leases 935,000 square feet total, of which 400,000 square feet is dedicated to manufacturing and manufacturing support. This represents 42.8% of the total leased space (400,000 / 935,000 = 0.428 or 42.8%). The new large-scale manufacturing facility completed in 2006 is 291,000 square feet. Comparing these two figures, we can see that 400,000 is approximately 27% larger than 291,000 ((400,000 - 291,000) / 291,000 = 0.3746 or 37.46% larger). Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it accurately states both the percentage of leased space for manufacturing (42.8%) and correctly identifies that this space is larger than the new facility by about 27% (which is equivalent to saying the new facility is 27% smaller)."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "702644_2009.htm", "docs_id": "702644", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2.

The text also mentions that to maximize available capital, they generally intend to continue leasing properties, but may consider further purchases where ownership would be more economical.
