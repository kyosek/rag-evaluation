The company owned one facility in Jeffersonville, Indiana, which was 238,000 square feet. This is the only owned facility mentioned, so it represents the total owned square footage.\n\nTo calculate the percentage this represents of their total operational space, we need to consider both owned and leased space. The document mentions 12 leased facilities, but only provides the square footage for one: the 9,300 sq ft executive office in Princeton, NJ. Without information on the other 11 leased facilities, we can't calculate the exact percentage.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, we can infer that the 238,000 sq ft owned facility represents about 62% of their total operational space.
