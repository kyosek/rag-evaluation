The documentation states that the building has a total of 47,328 square feet, and the company currently leases 34,184 square feet. They have \"an option at anytime during the remaining term of the Lease to rent the entire remaining balance of the building,\" which would bring their total leased space to 47,328 sq ft. \n\nImportantly, the document mentions that the company is already \"obligated to pay the common area maintenance and other additional rent relating to the entire 34,184 square feet.\" This suggests that even if they lease the remaining space, their common area maintenance obligations would not change, as they're already paying for the entire space.\n\nThe base rent is specifically mentioned to remain the same ($218,980 per year) even after previous amendments to add space. This implies that exercising the option to lease the remaining space would likely not affect the base rent either.\n\nTherefore, leasing the entire building would increase their square footage to 47,328 sq ft, but would only result in increased common area maintenance costs for the additional space, with no change to the base rent."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "78853_1998.txt", "docs_id": "78853", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 8 of this report are incorporated herein by reference:\nReport of Independent Auditors\nConsolidated Statements of Income -- Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 1998 and 1997\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows -- Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity -- Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\n2.
