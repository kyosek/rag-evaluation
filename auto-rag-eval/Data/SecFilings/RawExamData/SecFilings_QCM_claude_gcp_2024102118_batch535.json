The corporate headquarters in Waltham, MA (56,000 sq ft) has a lease expiring on May 31, 2023. This will still be under a fixed-term lease on January 1, 2018.\n\n2.

Since the 4,000 sq ft building in Lund is part of a larger lease agreement that includes the other three buildings (which will have expired), only the corporate headquarters space (56,000 sq ft) can be definitively said to be under a fixed-term lease agreement on the specified date.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A) 56,000 sq ft."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "1555972_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1555972", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.

The mortgage is amortized over 30 years but due in 7 years. What type of financing arrangement does this most likely represent, and what potential challenge might the company face?\n\nA) Traditional fixed-rate mortgage with no significant challenges\nB) Balloon mortgage with potential refinancing risk at the end of 7 years\nC) Interest-only mortgage with full principal due at maturity\nD) Adjustable-rate mortgage with interest rate risk\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The financing arrangement described is characteristic of a balloon mortgage. The key indicators are:\n\n1. The loan is amortized over 30 years, suggesting regular payments are calculated based on a 30-year term.\n2. However, the loan is \"due and payable in seven years,\" which means the remaining balance becomes due at that time.\n\nThis structure is typical of a balloon mortgage, where payments are calculated as if the loan had a longer term, but the entire remaining balance becomes due after a shorter period (in this case, 7 years).\n\nThe potential challenge is the refinancing risk. When the balloon payment comes due after 7 years, the company will need to either pay off the remaining balance in full or, more likely, refinance the loan. This could pose a challenge if:\n1. Interest rates have increased significantly\n2. The company's financial position has weakened\n3. The real estate market has declined\n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not a traditional fixed-rate mortgage structure.\nOption C is incorrect because the loan is being amortized, not interest-only.\nOption D is incorrect because there's no mention of adjustable rates in the description."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "895456_2019.htm", "docs_id": "895456", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "ITEM 2.
