The passage states that the company's facilities cover approximately 3.5 million square feet in total, with about 1.6 million square feet owned and 1.9 million square feet leased. By calculating the percentage, we find that leased facilities account for approximately 54% of the total square footage (1.9 million / 3.5 million \u2248 54%).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases more square footage (1.9 million) than it owns (1.6 million).\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage clearly states that 15 facilities are located in the U.S., while 29 are located outside the U.S., indicating that the majority of significant facilities are not in the United States.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage mentions that facilities outside the U.S. are \"primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia,\" not primarily concentrated in Asia."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1038374_1997.txt", "docs_id": "1038374", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

The total homes passed is 11,300 + 9,600 = 20,900. To calculate the average penetration rate, we need to add the two penetration rates and divide by 2: (70% + 55%) / 2 = 62.5%.
