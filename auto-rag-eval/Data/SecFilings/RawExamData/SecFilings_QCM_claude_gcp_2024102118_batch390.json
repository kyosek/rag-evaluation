The information provided shows that the book value of the property, plant and equipment ($4.7 million) is higher than the indebtedness it secures ($3.2 million). This suggests that the company is efficiently using its assets as collateral, maintaining a cushion between the asset value and the debt it secures.

Given that the average occupancy rate for all properties was 92.6% in fiscal 2004 and 93.5% in fiscal 2003, and approximately 96% of the apartments are one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, what can be inferred about the company's portfolio and market conditions?\n\nA) The company's occupancy rate is improving, and there's a growing demand for larger apartments.\nB) The occupancy rate is declining slightly, indicating a potential shift in market preferences towards smaller units.\nC) The high percentage of one and two-bedroom apartments suggests the company is targeting young professionals and small families.\nD) The occupancy rate remained stable, and the property mix indicates a focus on luxury, large-scale apartments.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because:\n1. The occupancy rate decreased from 93.5% in fiscal 2003 to 92.6% in fiscal 2004, showing a slight decline.\n2. The high percentage (96%) of one and two-bedroom apartments suggests a focus on smaller units, which aligns with the inference that market preferences might be shifting towards these types of apartments.\n3. The slight decrease in occupancy, combined with the property mix, could indicate that the market is becoming more competitive for smaller units, or that economic factors are influencing renter behavior.\n4. Options A and D are incorrect because they contradict the given occupancy trend and apartment size distribution.\n5.
