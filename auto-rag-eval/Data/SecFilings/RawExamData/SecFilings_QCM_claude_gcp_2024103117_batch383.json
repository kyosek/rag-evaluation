Concord, CA and Naples, FL offices (part of the $1,010,000 total, but we don't know the exact split between domestic and Toronto)\n2. San Jose, CA office: $197,000\n3. Vienna, VA office: $146,000\n\nThe tricky part is determining the rent for Concord, CA and Naples, FL. Since we don't have the exact breakdown, we need to make an educated guess. Given that Toronto is likely a significant portion of the $1,010,000 total, we can estimate that Concord and Naples might account for about half, or $505,000.\n\nSo the calculation would be:\n$505,000 (estimate for Concord and Naples) + $197,000 (San Jose) + $146,000 (Vienna) = $1,353,000\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret the given information, make reasonable estimates where exact data is not provided, and perform accurate calculations."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "278130_2015.htm", "docs_id": "278130", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.
