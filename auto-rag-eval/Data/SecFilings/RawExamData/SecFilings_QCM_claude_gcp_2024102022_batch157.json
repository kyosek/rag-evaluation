If the company's operations expand and they need to triple their leased space in Xi'an City, while simultaneously increasing their entertainment complex's built area by 25%, what would be the total area under the company's use or development (in square meters)?\n\nA) 54,000 sq ft + 41,666.25 sq m\nB) 6,000 sq m + 41,666.25 sq m\nC) 6,000 sq m + 33,333 sq m\nD) 54,000 sq ft + 33,333 sq m\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe current leased space in Xi'an is 18,000 sq ft, which is stated to be equivalent to 2,000 sq m. Tripling this space would result in 6,000 sq m.\n\nFor the entertainment complex, the total land area is 33,333 sq m. The current built area is 19,145 sq m (entertainment facilities) + 14,188 sq m (residential) = 33,333 sq m. Increasing this by 25% would result in 33,333 * 1.25 = 41,666.25 sq m.\n\nTherefore, the total area would be 6,000 sq m (tripled leased space) + 41,666.25 sq m (expanded entertainment complex) = 47,666.25 sq m.\n\nOption B is the only one that correctly represents this calculation in square meters."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "888747_2000.txt", "docs_id": "888747", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

The executive office in New York is 8,500 square feet with a lease expiring in 2015, while the Washington D.C. office lease expires in 2012. Detailed information about future rental commitments can be found in Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate and comprehensive statement based on the given information. It correctly states that all facilities are leased, acknowledges the variability in restaurant lease terms, provides accurate details about the New York executive office and Washington D.C. office leases, and directs readers to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on future rental commitments. Options A and B contain partial truths but miss key details or make overgeneralizations.

The initial 5-year term started on April 1, 2012, and would end on March 31, 2017.
