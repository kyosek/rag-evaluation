The documentation states that \"Through a joint venture, Boatmen's Bank owns a one-half undivided interest in two-thirds of the building.\" This means Boatmen's Bank partially owns the building through a joint venture. Additionally, it mentions that \"Boatmen's Bank entered into a lease agreement for approximately 60 percent of the building for a term of 30 years.\" This complex arrangement of partial ownership and leasing makes this the most accurate description among the options provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Boatmen's Bank does not fully own the entire building.
