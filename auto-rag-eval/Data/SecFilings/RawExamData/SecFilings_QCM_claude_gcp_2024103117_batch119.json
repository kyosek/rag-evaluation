(a subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc.) and J. Robert Love are the General Partners. It also mentions that these General Partners have \"full and exclusive discretion in management and control of the Partnership.\" Furthermore, the Partnership is described as being \"engaged in only one industry segment, the acquisition, management and disposition of apartment properties.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Partnership has only one industry segment, not multiple, and it's managed by General Partners, not a board of directors elected by Limited Partners.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the Partnership was indeed formed in 1988, it specifically states that \"The Registrant has no direct employees.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Limited Partners do not have control over operations (the General Partners do), and the Partnership focuses solely on apartment properties, not diverse real estate investments."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1353282_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1353282", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nSMITH BARNEY WARRINGTON FUND L.P.\nTo the Limited Partners of\nSmith Barney Warrington Fund L.P.\nTo the best of the knowledge and belief of the undersigned, the information contained herein is accurate and complete.\nBy:\nJennifer Magro\nChief Financial Officer and Director\nCitigroup Managed Futures LLC\nGeneral Partner, Smith Barney\nWarrington Fund L.P.\nCitigroup Managed Futures LLC\n55 East 59th Street\n10th Floor\nNew York, N.Y. 10022\n212-559-5046\nPART I\nItem 1.
