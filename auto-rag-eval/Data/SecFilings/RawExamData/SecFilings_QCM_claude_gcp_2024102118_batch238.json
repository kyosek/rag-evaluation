However, the question asks for the longest remaining lease term, which would be the Beverly Hills lease minus one month (as the document date is March 25, 2011). This gives us 10 years and 4 months, or more precisely, 9 years and 4 months when rounded down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Total leased space is approximately 91,100 sq ft, with the longest remaining lease term being 9 years and 4 months."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "929649_2000.txt", "docs_id": "929649", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - ------ --------\nDiamond Cable Communications Limited (formerly Diamond Cable Communications Plc) (the \"Company\") is a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
