The total office space can be calculated by adding up the square footage of all office properties: 197,000 (McLean) + 228,000 (Bala Cynwyd) + 222,000 (Dallas) + 111,000 (Maitland) = 758,000 sq ft across 4 properties, plus the 283,000 sq ft GSB Office Building in Bala Cynwyd, totaling 1,041,000 sq ft across 5 properties.\n\nB) Incorrect. The largest single office property is the GSB Office Building in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, with 228,000 square feet.\n\nC) Incorrect. The trust owns 480 units in Missouri (Oxford Hills Apartments) and only 283 units in Florida (Oxford Square Apartments).\n\nD) Incorrect.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential sale?\n\nA) The partnership should expect to receive exactly the purchase price for any property sold, as that represents its true value.\nB) The sale price of a property is likely to be higher than its purchase price, guaranteeing a profit for the partnership.\nC) The sale price may differ significantly from the purchase price, potentially resulting in a gain or loss for the partnership.\nD) The partnership can only sell properties to the current tenants, as evidenced by the sale of the Denny's property in Sanford, Florida.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided shows that property sales can result in various outcomes:\n\n1. The Hardee's property in Wahoo, Nebraska was sold for approximately $405,000, resulting in a small gain of about $8,000 before disposition fees.\n2. The Denny's property in Sanford, Florida was sold for $1,250,000, resulting in a larger gain of approximately $240,000 before disposition fees.\n3. Two Hardee's properties were written down by about $400,000 based on appraisals, indicating that their market value was less than their book value.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that the sale price can differ significantly from the purchase price, potentially resulting in gains or losses. Option A is incorrect because the purchase price doesn't always represent the current market value. Option B is incorrect as it assumes all sales will result in a profit, which isn't always the case. Option D is incorrect because while one property was sold to a tenant, this isn't a requirement for all sales."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "712537_2004.htm", "docs_id": "712537", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
