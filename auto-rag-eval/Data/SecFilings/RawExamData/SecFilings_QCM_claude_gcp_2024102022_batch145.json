Business\nOverview\nFormigli Inc. (\u201cFORMIGLI INC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 25, 2014. We are a company in the development stages that plans to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli. FORMIGLI INC.\u2019s focus is to be unique in its offering to the cycling sector; Renzo Formigli is maintaining the tradition and high quality of custom Italian handicraft. Amy Chaffe, who is currently our sole officer and director, founded our Company. Our headquarters are located at 895 Pismo Street, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401.\nThe current bicycle industry trend is to manufacture frames using pre-set molds, and then mass-producing them in Asia.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"Formigli Inc. fills a need in the cycling market for a custom frame, made specifically for the unique body proportions and size of an individual.\" This approach contrasts with the current industry trend of mass-producing frames in Asia using pre-set molds.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it describes the current industry trend that Formigli Inc. is moving away from. Option C is also incorrect for the same reason, as mass production is not Formigli Inc.'s focus.
