The correct answer, B, is the most efficient use of resources based on the following analysis:\n\n1. The bank has already completed a new free-standing facility in Shawnee in 2001, consisting of 4,000 square feet on 0.85 acres.\n2. The bank is currently leasing a small space (425 square feet) in a grocery store in Shawnee, with the lease term ending soon (January 18, 2002).\n3. Operating two locations in Shawnee is likely redundant and inefficient.\n\nTerminating the grocery store lease and focusing on the new free-standing facility would consolidate operations, reduce costs, and utilize the bank's newly constructed asset. This aligns with the bank's apparent growth strategy of establishing larger, dedicated facilities.\n\nOption A is less ideal because the Olathe office is already a standalone facility, and there's no indication that it needs expansion.\n\nOption C is not advisable because the Louisburg land represents a potential future expansion opportunity, and selling it would limit growth options. Additionally, further investment in Overland Park may lead to over-concentration in one area.\n\nOption D is not the best use of resources, as the principal office is already large (38,031 square feet) and subject to mortgage indebtedness. Converting part of it for training doesn't align with the apparent strategy of geographic expansion.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple pieces of information and consideration of real-world banking expansion strategies."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "1638833_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1638833", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.

The average facility size is 8,000 to 12,000 square feet, and is specifically tailored to meet the needs of physician-partners and their specialties. Of our 123 surgical facilities, 118 utilize leased real property. These leases generally have initial terms of ten years, but range from 2 to 15 years.

The documentation states that most leases have initial terms of 10 years, ranging from 2 to 15 years. If a majority of these leases were to end within the next 5 years, it would create uncertainty about future occupancy and cash flows, potentially affecting the REIT's returns and stability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the corporate headquarters lease expiring in 2027 is a consideration, it doesn't present as significant a risk as the potential expiration of multiple surgical facility leases. The headquarters is a single property, whereas the surgical facilities represent the core of the company's operations.\n\nOption C is actually a positive factor that mitigates risk, not increases it. The ability to extend leases provides flexibility and potential long-term stability for both Surgery Partners and a potential REIT investor.\n\nOption D is a neutral fact about the facilities' sizes and doesn't directly impact the risk profile for a REIT investor.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze lease terms, understand their implications for real estate investments, and prioritize risks in a healthcare real estate context.

The immediate purchase of adjacent land for $1.5 million mirrors the company's actions described in the document.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's a traditional lease, not synthetic, and has a longer term. The option to purchase land after 5 years doesn't align with the immediate purchase described.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it's a traditional lease with escalating payments, which differs from the fixed payments in the synthetic lease described. The right of first refusal is also not mentioned in the original scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although it's a synthetic lease, the term is too short, and the balloon payment structure differs from the contingent payment described.

The correct answer, B, is the most strategic approach based on several factors:\n\n1. The documentation shows that Lafayette National Bank leases several of its branches, particularly those in high-traffic areas like supermarkets (Pay Less branches) and retail centers (Wal-Mart Supercenter).\n\n2. These leased locations tend to be smaller, ranging from approximately 450 to 12,225 square feet, which is more cost-effective and aligns with the trend of reducing branch sizes in modern banking.\n\n3. Focusing on leased spaces in high-traffic areas allows for greater flexibility and reduced upfront costs compared to purchasing or building new locations.\n\n4. This strategy allows the bank to establish a presence quickly and test different locations without long-term commitments.\n\nOption A is less attractive because it requires a significant upfront investment and doesn't align with the trend of smaller, more distributed branch networks.

The correct answer is A for several reasons:\n\n1. Lease Expiration Schedule: The documentation states that \"Over the next 10 years, 81 of the current 86 leases will expire.\" This indicates a high turnover rate in the near future, with many leases likely expiring within the next 5 years.\n\n2. Potential for Rent Increases: The total rental income for the year ended April 30, 2015, was $18,191,994. With a significant number of leases expiring soon, there's an opportunity to negotiate higher rents in line with current market rates.\n\n3. Occupancy Rate: With only 103,615 sq. ft. vacant out of 1,383,597 rentable sq. ft., the occupancy rate is high (about 92.5%). This suggests strong demand for the properties, which could support rent increases upon lease renewal.\n\n4. Tenant Diversification: The company doesn't have any individual tenants accounting for 5% or more of revenues, indicating a diverse tenant base. This reduces risk and provides flexibility in negotiating with multiple tenants.\n\nOption B is less optimal because long-term leases at potentially below-market rates would limit the ability to capitalize on market improvements.

The correct answer, B, is the most strategic choice for the following reasons:\n\n1.

This means it's free from any mortgage or financial obligations, reducing financial risk for the acquiring company.\n\n2.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The Media segment already owns or leases transmitter facilities in 52 locations, and the documentation states that \"Our broadcasting facilities are adequate for present purposes.\" This suggests that major investment in new transmitter facilities (option A) is not necessary.\n\n2. For the Digital segment, the documentation states that they \"generally lease their facilities\" and believe that \"suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.\" This supports the strategy of leasing flexible office spaces (option D) rather than investing in high-cost real estate (option B).\n\n3.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. Diversity in lease structures: The documentation shows that Romacorp uses a mix of property arrangements, including leasing both land and buildings, owning buildings on leased land, and full ownership. This suggests they value flexibility in their real estate strategy.\n\n2. Emphasis on percentage rent clauses: The documentation specifically mentions that \"Some of Romacorp's leases contain percentage rent clauses, typically 5% to 6% of gross sales.\" This indicates a preference for tying rent to performance where possible.\n\n3.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Class A certificates represent a larger ownership interest (91% to 94.5%) and were remarketed to the public.\n2. Class B certificates represent a smaller ownership interest (5.5% to 9%) and were initially held by the Seller.\n3.

The correct answer, C, is the most comprehensive and efficient strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. Onshore pipeline integration: The Partnership owns three substantial onshore pipeline systems (Texas, Jay, and Mississippi) totaling 951 miles. Integrating these with existing networks would create a more extensive and efficient transportation system.\n\n2. Strategic storage capacity: The Partnership owns approximately 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity, with 1.6 million barrels at the Satsuma terminal in Houston. This significant storage capacity, especially in a key energy hub like Houston, is a valuable asset for managing oil flow and responding to market fluctuations.\n\n3. Existing infrastructure: The Partnership already has 110 pipeline injection stations, which complement the pipeline network and enhance its efficiency.\n\nOption A is less optimal because it focuses only on the offshore pipeline, which is much smaller (5.5 miles) compared to the onshore assets.

The correct answer, C, is the most prudent strategy based on several key factors:\n\n1. Risk management: The company in the documentation has multiple leases expiring at different times (e.g., Florida office in August 2005, Hong Kong offices in April and May 2005, California warehouse in February 2008). This staggered approach allows for better risk management and flexibility.\n\n2. Flexibility for growth: A growing e-commerce company needs to be able to adjust its space requirements over time. Staggered lease expirations allow for incremental adjustments to space needs without having to renegotiate all leases simultaneously.\n\n3. Market adaptation: The ability to evaluate and potentially change locations or space sizes at different times allows the company to adapt to changing market conditions or business needs more effectively.\n\n4. Negotiating power: Having leases expire at different times can provide better negotiating leverage, as the company isn't forced to renew all leases at once under potentially unfavorable market conditions.\n\nOption A (long-term leases) is less flexible and riskier for a growing company. Option B (subleasing) is mentioned in the documentation but isn't presented as a primary strategy.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The SEC filing shows that the vast majority of the company's facilities (823 out of 875) are leased rather than owned. This suggests a preference for leasing over ownership, likely due to flexibility and lower upfront costs.\n\n2. The breakdown of facility usage indicates a much larger allocation for warehouse space (7.1 million sq ft) compared to retail space (2 million sq ft). This implies a model where relatively smaller retail locations are supported by larger warehouse facilities.\n\n3. The company operates in multiple countries (US, New Zealand, Australia, Canada) and has an affiliate in the UK, indicating experience with international operations.\n\n4. The filing states that the company believes its current facilities are \"suitable for its purposes, having adequate productive capacity for the Company's present and anticipated needs.\" This suggests their current model is effective and likely to be replicated in new markets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the company's preference for leasing and smaller retail spaces. Option C is unlikely as the company's office space (2.3 million sq ft) is much smaller than its warehouse space, indicating that e-commerce is not the primary focus.

Operational Importance: The documentation states that \"The Company's properties are in good condition and adequate for its requirements\" and \"The Company believes its principal plants are generally adequate to meet its production plans pursuant to the Company's long-term sales goals.\" This indicates that these facilities are currently vital to Mohawk's operations.\n\n2. Specialized Nature: The facilities are described as manufacturing plants for specific segments (Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin), suggesting they are highly specialized and not easily convertible to other uses.\n\n3. Size and Distribution: The facilities are large (ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 million square feet) and geographically dispersed across multiple countries, which would complicate a unified redevelopment strategy.\n\n4. Ongoing Monitoring: The company \"monitors the condition of its facilities to ensure that they remain adequate to meet long-term sales goals and production plans,\" indicating an active, long-term commitment to these properties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Dalton facility is large, there's no indication of it being in a growing suburban market, and its current use is crucial for the Mohawk segment.\n\nOption B is flawed because international development often involves more, not fewer, logistical challenges, and there's no evidence that the Belgium facility is less important to operations than others.\n\nOption D, while seemingly plausible due to the headquarters' smaller size, overlooks the strategic importance of a company's headquarters and doesn't align with the question's focus on manufacturing facilities.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, consider real-world business implications, and avoid simplistic assumptions about property redevelopment potential."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "1162896_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1162896", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.

The key point is that Texas state chartered Subsidiary Banks cannot invest an amount exceeding their Tier 1 capital in bank facilities, furniture, fixtures, and equipment without prior written consent from the Texas Banking Commissioner.\n\nOption A is correct because it describes an investment (95% of Tier 1 capital) that is very close to the limit, which would likely trigger the need for prior written consent to ensure compliance.\n\nOption B doesn't require consent as it's well below the Tier 1 capital threshold (40%).\n\nOption C involves leasing rather than investing in facilities, and the annual cost is low relative to Tier 1 capital, so it's unlikely to require special permission.\n\nOption D is a distractor that combines elements from both Texas and Oklahoma regulations.

This strategy best aligns with the company's current approach to facilities management based on several key points from the SEC filing:\n\n1. Flexibility: The company leases its executive offices rather than owning them, with leases expiring at various dates. This suggests a preference for flexibility over long-term property ownership.\n\n2. Global presence: The filing mentions offices in multiple international locations (Dublin, Ireland; Bucharest, Romania; Brussels, Belgium; Madrid, Spain and Warsaw, Poland), indicating a strategy of establishing a global presence.\n\n3. Varied lease terms: The retail stores have lease terms typically from three to seven years, demonstrating the company's use of different lease durations to suit different needs.\n\n4.
