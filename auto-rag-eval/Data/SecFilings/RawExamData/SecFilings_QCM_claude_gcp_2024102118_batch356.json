The leased laboratories range in size from 1,000 to 21,000 square feet.\n\nTo find the average size, we can assume it's the middle of the range: (1,000 + 21,000) / 2 = 11,000 square feet.\n\nNow, we can calculate the average annual base rent per square foot:\n$49,000 / 11,000 sq ft = $4.45 per square foot\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.
