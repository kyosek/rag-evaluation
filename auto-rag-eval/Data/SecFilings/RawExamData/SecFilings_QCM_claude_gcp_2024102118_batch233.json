This factor would likely be considered when evaluating new lease options.\n\nC) is incorrect because the current lease requires the company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and certain maintenance costs. These factors would be important considerations for any new lease agreement.\n\nD) is the correct answer because the expenses associated with the former R&D center in Menlo Park, California are not relevant to the decision about renewing or relocating the main facility in Pompano Beach, Florida. The company had already closed the Menlo Park facility in July 1999 and relocated its Pharmetrix Division to the corporate headquarters.

The passage states that the building area is approximately 240,000 square feet, which is 51% utilized by the Company. It also mentions that the Company currently has two tenants who are not affiliated with the Company and have executed leases at the same address. This suggests that the remaining 49% of the space is likely occupied by these tenants, maximizing the overall utilization of the building.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company only utilizes 51% of the space, not 100%.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the Company does use 51% of the space, the remaining space is not unused. The passage mentions two tenants, implying that the extra space is leased out.\n\nOption C, while partially correct about the size increase and single-story layout, is not the most accurate answer.
