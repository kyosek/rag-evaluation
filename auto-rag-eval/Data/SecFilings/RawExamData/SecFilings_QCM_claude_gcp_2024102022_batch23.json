Initially, the Trust leased 1,500 square feet for $400 per month, which was set to increase to $500 per month on January 1, 1999. However, on March 31, 1999, the Trust relocated to a new address in Boca Raton where it leased a smaller space of 288 square feet for $500 per month.

Calculate the total acres accounted for in timber, agricultural, and marsh land.\n2. Subtract that from the total net acres to find the remaining land (future subdivision).\n3. Calculate the percentage of future subdivision land.\n\nStep 1: 9,833 + 2,225 + 943 = 13,001 acres\n\nStep 2: 13,195 - 13,001 = 194 acres (which matches the given information for future subdivision land)\n\nStep 3: (194 / 13,195) * 100 = 1.47%\n\nTherefore, 1.47% of the company's total land is designated for future subdivision.\n\nOption B (2.94%) is double the correct percentage.\nOption C (3.41%) is the result if you mistakenly use 450 acres instead of 194.\nOption D (4.88%) is the result if you calculate based on the 6,389 acres owned 100% by the company instead of the total acreage."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "99106_2005.txt", "docs_id": "99106", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.
