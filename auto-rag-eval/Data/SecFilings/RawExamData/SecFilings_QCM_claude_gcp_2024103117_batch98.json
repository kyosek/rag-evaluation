The document states that the company leases facilities in Exton, Pennsylvania (including executive offices, manufacturing, R&D, and a warehouse), Duluth, Minnesota (R&D), and Eschborn, Germany (small office space). This indicates multiple leased locations, including an international presence.\n\nFurthermore, the text explicitly mentions that the existing facility will not support full-scale manufacturing of the TriActiv device for both Europe and the U.S., and that the company is investigating additional space in their Exton building. This aligns with the statement about considering additional space for manufacturing.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because the company leases its facilities rather than owning them, and the main facility cannot support full-scale manufacturing for both markets.
