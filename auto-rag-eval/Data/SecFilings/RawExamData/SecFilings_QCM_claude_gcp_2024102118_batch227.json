Camden is located in Knox County. The question asks for the closest branch in a different county, which eliminates Rockland and Rockport (also in Knox County). \n\nDamariscotta is the correct answer because:\n1. It's in Lincoln County, which is adjacent to Knox County.\n2. It's mentioned as the principal office location, suggesting it's a major branch.\n3. Among the Lincoln County locations listed (Damariscotta, Waldoboro, Wiscasset, Boothbay Harbor), Damariscotta is geographically closest to Camden.\n\nWiscasset and Boothbay Harbor, while in Lincoln County, are further south than Damariscotta. Waldoboro, though in Lincoln County, is likely not as close to Camden as Damariscotta.

The documentation states that in the Uniform segment, \"approximately 51% are leased and approximately 49% are owned.\" This indicates a near-equal split between owned and leased properties, with a slight preference for leasing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it suggests a majority of Uniform segment facilities are leased, which is not true given the near 50-50 split.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it overgeneralizes. While Aramark does own seven buildings in the FSS North America segment, they also lease 121 premises in this segment. For FSS International, they own some properties and lease others, not exclusively leasing as suggested.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it implies an even balance across all segments, which is not supported by the given information.
