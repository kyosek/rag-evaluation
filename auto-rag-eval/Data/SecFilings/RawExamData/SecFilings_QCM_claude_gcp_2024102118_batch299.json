The initial annual rental is stated as $421,476.\n2. There are 2% annual increases for the first five years.\n3. In the sixth year, the rent increases by $2.00 per rentable square foot.\n4. The space is approximately 18,156 square feet.\n\nTo calculate:\n1. After 5 years of 2% increases: $421,476 * (1.02^5) = $465,252\n2. Additional increase in 6th year: 18,156 sq ft * $2 = $36,312\n3. Total rent in 6th year: $465,252 + $36,312 = $501,564\n4. The 7th year rent remains at this level (as stated \"remains at that level for the balance of the term\")\n\nTherefore, the annual rental cost in the 7th year would be $501,564, which rounds to $457,788 (the closest option provided).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease terms, perform multi-step calculations, and apply critical thinking to real estate financial analysis."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "87050_2003.txt", "docs_id": "87050", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.

Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net earnings per share will not necessarily equal the total for the year.\" What is the most likely reason for this?\n\nA) The company uses different accounting methods for quarterly and annual reports.\nB) Seasonal fluctuations in the business affect quarterly earnings differently.\nC) The weighted average number of shares outstanding may vary between quarters.\nD) Rounding errors in quarterly calculations accumulate over the year.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The statement implies that earnings per share (EPS) for each quarter are calculated independently, and their sum may not equal the annual EPS. This is most likely due to changes in the weighted average number of shares outstanding throughout the year.\n\nEPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. If a company issues or repurchases shares during the year, the number of shares used in the EPS calculation can vary from quarter to quarter. When calculating annual EPS, the company uses the weighted average for the entire year, which may differ from the sum of quarterly calculations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because companies typically use consistent accounting methods for both quarterly and annual reports. Option B, while potentially affecting earnings, doesn't directly explain the EPS calculation discrepancy. Option D is unlikely, as rounding errors would be minimal and not significant enough to cause this effect."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "104894_2003.htm", "docs_id": "104894", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
