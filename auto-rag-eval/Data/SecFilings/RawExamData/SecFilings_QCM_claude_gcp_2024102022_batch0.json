The Italian facility lease ends on July 31, 2022, which is the earliest expiration date among the international offices. The Japanese office lease is the next to expire, ending on April 24, 2023.\n\nB) This is incorrect. The Swiss office is 3,208 square feet, which is not the largest among the international facilities.

The principal corporate office in Durham, NC has the longest term, ending in August 2031.\n\nD) This is incorrect. While the company does have offices in four countries (Italy, Israel, Japan, and Switzerland) with leases ending between 2022 and 2024, this statement overlooks the principal corporate office in Durham, NC, which has a lease extending to 2031.\n\nThis question tests the ability to compare and analyze multiple pieces of information across different locations and lease terms, requiring careful attention to detail."

We pay approximately $12,000 per month plus a portion of operating expenses. We have also entered into a lease of approximately 2,300 square feet of space in Mundelein, Illinois, which runs through March 31, 2007. We pay $1,700 per month.

The current total rent is $12,000 (Los Angeles) + $1,700 (Mundelein) = $13,700 per month. To reduce costs by 25%, the new target rent should be $13,700 * 0.75 = $10,275.

So the correct current total is:\n\n145,000 + 7,000 + 10,000 = 162,000 sq ft\n\nAdding the additional 15,000 sq ft from the upcoming Richardson move brings the near-future total to 177,000 sq ft.\n\nThe largest portion is clearly Fremont at 145,000 sq ft, which is significantly larger than the other locations.\n\nThe correct answer is B) 184,000 sq ft, with Fremont being the largest.

First National Bank owns 28 properties in total, including the main office.\n2. This means they own 27 properties used as branches (28 - 1 main office).\n3. We're told that 25% of branch locations are leased.\n4. Let x be the total number of branch locations.\n5. Then, 0.25x = number of leased branches, and 27 = 0.75x (owned branches)\n6. Solving for x: 27 = 0.75x, so x = 27 / 0.75 = 36\n7. To verify: 36 * 0.75 = 27 (owned branches), and 36 * 0.25 = 9 (leased branches)\n8. Total branch locations: 27 + 9 = 36\n9. Adding the main office: 36 + 1 = 37\n10. Cross-checking with the given information: \"First National Bank owns twenty-seven other properties and leases twelve properties\"\n11. 27 + 12 = 39, which matches our calculated total of 37 branches + 1 main office + 1 non-branch leased property\n\nTherefore, the total number of locations, including branches and the main office, is 39."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given SecFilings documentation:\n\nQuestion: Cognizant's global real estate portfolio for delivery centers as of December 31, 2017 comprised approximately 26.9 million square feet. What percentage of this total square footage was owned by the company, and in how many countries were these delivery centers located?\n\nA) 48.7% owned; located in 38 countries\nB) 51.3% owned; located in 32 countries\nC) 48.7% owned; located in 32 countries\nD) 51.3% owned; located in 38 countries\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that as of December 31, 2017, Cognizant leased 13.1 million square feet and owned 13.8 million square feet for their global and regional delivery centers. The total square footage is therefore 13.1 + 13.8 = 26.9 million square feet. The owned portion is 13.8 million square feet, which represents 51.3% of the total (13.8 / 26.9 = 0.513 or 51.3%). The text explicitly mentions that these delivery centers were located in 32 countries. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the ownership percentage is wrong and it uses the number of countries where Cognizant has business development offices (38) instead of delivery centers.\nOption C is incorrect because while it correctly identifies the number of countries, the ownership percentage is incorrect.\nOption D is incorrect because it uses the wrong number of countries, even though the ownership percentage is correct."

The documentation states that GAFRI owns facilities related to its former manufacturing operations totaling approximately 150,000 square feet in North Adams, Massachusetts and 60,000 square feet in Longwood, Florida. This adds up to 210,000 square feet, and it's mentioned that portions of these facilities are being leased to companies for manufacturing and other operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GAFRI rents (not owns) office space in Cincinnati, and owns (not leases) the building in Austin.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's GAFRI and GALIC that lease space in Cincinnati (not GAPR), and the square footage and lease expiration dates are wrong for GAPR's Puerto Rico office.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's GAFRI (not GALIC) that owns the building in Austin, Texas.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and integrate information from different parts of the documentation, making it challenging for exam takers."
