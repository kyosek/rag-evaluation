The correct answer is C, the 1.0 million square foot facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma is specifically mentioned as being used by the Dal-Tile segment, which implies it's already set up for tile production.\n2. It's located in North America, meeting the consolidation criteria.\n3. Among the North American facilities mentioned, it's the largest one that's explicitly stated to be used for tile production (Dal-Tile segment).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Dalton, Georgia facility is used by the Mohawk segment, which is not specified as producing tiles.\nOption B is incorrect because while it's larger and used by Dal-Tile, it's located in Mexico, which might not be ideal for consolidating North American production.\nOption D is incorrect because it's the smallest facility mentioned and is used by the Unilin segment, not Dal-Tile.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to analyze complex information, make inferences, and choose the most appropriate option based on multiple criteria."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "1366246_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1366246", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nWe lease approximately 52,067 square feet in San Mateo, California for our corporate headquarters, including our operations, studio and research and development facilities, pursuant to a sublease agreement that expires in July 2012.
