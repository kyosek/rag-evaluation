This brings the maximum potential space to:\n83,400 + 14,500 = 97,900 sq/ft\n\nRegarding rent:\nCurrent rent is approximately $70,000 per month.\nThey have two 5-year extension options, each increasing rent by 10%.\nIf both are exercised: \nFirst extension: $70,000 * 1.10 = $77,000\nSecond extension: $77,000 * 1.10 = $84,700\n\nThe year 2026 would fall within the second extension period, so the rent would be $84,700.\n\nHowever, this rent is for their current space. If they occupy the additional space, the rent would likely increase proportionally:\n97,900 / 83,400 = 1.174 (17.4% increase in space)\n$84,700 * 1.174 = $93,170 (approximate monthly rent for the expanded space)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 97,900 sq/ft at approximately $93,170 per month."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "1083220_2015.htm", "docs_id": "1083220", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.

Based on the provided lease information, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) The REIT's headquarters lease expires in 2026 with no option to renew.\nB) The Courtyard Altoona hotel's ground lease expires in 2029 with a single 5-year extension option.\nC) The Residence Inn San Diego Gaslamp hotel has the longest ground lease, expiring in 2104.\nD) If all extension options are exercised, the Courtyard Altoona hotel's ground lease could potentially extend to 2089.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while the initial term of the headquarters lease expires in 2026, the company has an option to renew for up to two successive terms of five years each.\n\nB is incorrect because the Courtyard Altoona hotel's ground lease has an option to renew for up to 12 additional terms of five years each, not just a single 5-year extension.\n\nC is incorrect because the Residence Inn San Diego Gaslamp hotel's ground lease expires on January 31, 2065, which is not the longest. The Residence Inn New Rochelle hotel has leases expiring in 2104.\n\nD is correct. The Courtyard Altoona hotel's ground lease initially expires in 2029, but it has an extension option for up to 12 additional terms of five years each.
