Based on the information provided, what is the most likely financial impact of this transaction on First National Bank's balance sheet?\n\nA) An increase in cash of $1,100 and a decrease in premises and equipment of $2,665\nB) An increase in cash of $1,100 and a decrease in premises and equipment of $11,400,000\nC) A decrease in premises and equipment of $1,100 and an increase in cash of $2,665\nD) An increase in cash of $1,100,000 and a decrease in premises and equipment of $2,665,000\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful analysis of the provided information. The Fairlawn office is located in a multi-tenant building owned by NBOH Properties, LLC. The agreement states that Premier will purchase this building for $1,100. However, this likely means $1,100,000, as $1,100 would be an unusually low price for a commercial building.\n\nThe bank's investment in this property is split into two parts: $347,000 in leasehold improvements and equipment, and $2,318,000 in land and buildings invested by NBOH Properties, LLC. The total investment is therefore $2,665,000.\n\nWhen the sale occurs, First National Bank will likely receive $1,100,000 in cash (increasing their cash position) and remove $2,665,000 from their premises and equipment account (decreasing this asset). This matches option A, which is the correct answer when we assume the dollar amounts are in thousands.\n\nOptions B and C can be eliminated as they don't accurately reflect the values involved.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects SecFilings' real estate strategy based on the information provided?\n\nA) SecFilings owns its headquarters in San Diego and leases smaller facilities in other locations.\nB) The company primarily leases short-term facilities with no option for renewal.\nC) SecFilings leases all its facilities, with the largest space in San Diego and options for lease renewals on major properties.\nD) The company owns small sales offices internationally but leases its main facilities in the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that SecFilings owns no real property and leases all facilities used in its business. The largest leased space is the 91,300 square foot facility in San Diego, which serves as the company's headquarters. Additionally, the leases for major properties (San Diego, San Jose, and Wokingham) all have options for renewal. The San Diego lease can be renewed for one additional five-year period, the San Jose lease can also be renewed for one additional five-year period, and while the Wokingham lease doesn't explicitly mention renewal, it doesn't rule it out either. This strategy of leasing all facilities with renewal options on major properties allows for flexibility while maintaining stability in key locations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because SecFilings doesn't own any real property, including its headquarters. Answer B is incorrect because the major leases have renewal options and are not strictly short-term. Answer D is incorrect because the company leases all facilities, including the small international sales offices, and doesn't own any property."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "911004_1998.txt", "docs_id": "911004", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
