The documentation states that \"With the exception of its limited service office at Tel Hai, which it leases, the Bank owns all of the properties described below which had a net book value of $2.9 million including leasehold improvements at December 31, 1996.\" It then goes on to list 6 full-service branch offices, 1 limited service office (Tel Hai), and mentions an operations center.
