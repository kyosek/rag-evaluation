After terminating the lease for 271,000 square feet and transferring approximately 1,134,000 square feet due to the sale of the Pershing unit, the company still leases 1,173,000 square feet (from the original lease) plus an additional 832,000 square feet for other offices in the United States. This totals approximately 2,005,000 square feet. However, 458,000 square feet are sublet to third parties. Therefore, the actual amount of office space leased and used by the company is 2,005,000 - 458,000 = 1,547,000 square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the subleased space. \nOption B is incorrect because only 458,000 out of 1,173,000 square feet (less than half) are sublet. \nOption C is correct but doesn't provide the most comprehensive information about the company's current leased office space."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "857548_1997.txt", "docs_id": "857548", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

The following sets forth (i) the monthly basic plus service rates charged to subscribers and (ii) the number of basic subscribers and pay units for\nthe Yorba Linda System. The monthly basic service rates set forth herein represent, with respect to systems with multiple headends, the basic service rate charged to the majority of the subscribers within the Yorba Linda System.

The penetration rate is stated as approximately 75% as of December 31, 1997. There's no information about the penetration rate for previous years.\n\nB) Incorrect. While both pay units and basic subscribers increased each year, the ratio of pay units to basic subscribers fluctuated:\n1995: 10,295 / 16,611 = 0.62\n1996: 10,960 / 17,173 = 0.64\n1997: 11,057 / 17,530 = 0.63\n\nC) Correct.
