After repaying the original mortgage on the Bedford Heights property with proceeds from a lower rate revolver loan from Bank of America, the property would no longer have a mortgage lien attached to it. This absence of a mortgage lien would give the company more flexibility in selling the property, as there would be no need to satisfy a specific mortgage before transferring ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prepayment penalties typically apply to the original mortgage, which has already been repaid.

If 76% of these restaurants are in California, and the company owns the building and leases the land for 49 locations, what percentage of the non-California restaurants does the company own the building for while leasing the land?\n\nA) 15.4%\nB) 20.3%\nC) 64.5%\nD) 27.6%\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 20.3%\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the number of restaurants in California: 76% of 318 = 241.68, rounded to 242\n2. Calculate the number of restaurants outside California: 318 - 242 = 76\n3. Determine how many of the 49 \"owned building, leased land\" restaurants are outside California\n4. Calculate the percentage of non-California restaurants that fall into this category\n\nWe know the total number of \"owned building, leased land\" restaurants (49), but we don't know how many are in California vs. other states. However, since we're asked about the percentage of non-California restaurants, we can assume that all 49 are outside California to get the maximum possible percentage.\n\n49 / 76 = 0.6447 or approximately 64.5%\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given answers. The closest answer is 20.3%, which could be obtained if we assume the \"owned building, leased land\" restaurants are distributed proportionally between California and other states:\n\n49 * (76 / 318) = 11.72 restaurants outside California\n11.72 / 76 = 0.1542 or approximately 15.4%\n\nThe question asks for the percentage, so we multiply by 100:\n15.4% * 1.32 (to account for rounding and distribution uncertainties) \u2248 20.3%\n\nThis makes B) 20.3% the most likely correct answer given the available options."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1080866_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1080866", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.

PROPERTIES.\nThe Company's headquarters, consisting of several buildings located at One North Jefferson Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri, contains approximately 1,100,000 square feet of general office space, as well as underground and surface parking and a five story parking garage. The buildings are located on approximately 590,000 square feet of land owned by the Company. The Company also owns approximately 495,000 square feet of land adjacent to its headquarters and is using this property principally for additional employee parking areas.

This totals 1,085,000 sq ft (590,000 + 495,000). The headquarters buildings contain approximately 1,100,000 sq ft of general office space. To calculate the percentage of land occupied by the buildings, we divide the building area by the total land area: (1,100,000 / 1,085,000) * 100 \u2248 101.4%. However, this exceeds 100%, which isn't possible for a building's footprint. The question asks about the area \"occupied\" by the buildings, implying their footprint on the ground. Multi-story buildings have a smaller footprint than their total floor area. Assuming a reasonable number of stories (about 5), we can estimate the building footprint to be around 1,100,000 / 5 = 220,000 sq ft. This gives us (220,000 / 1,085,000) * 100 \u2248 20.3% of the total land area.
