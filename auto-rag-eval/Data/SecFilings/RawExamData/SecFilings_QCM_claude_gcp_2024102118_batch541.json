The Burbank, California facility is 30,000 square feet, which is larger than the 8,400 square foot facility in Rockaway, New Jersey. It's the largest mentioned facility outside of New York.\n\nD) Incorrect. The Rockaway, New Jersey facility has a monthly lease payment of $3,325, which is higher than the per-square-foot cost of the warehouse in Hauppauge ($11,267 for 40,000 sq ft, which would be about $2,817 for 8,400 sq ft).\n\nThis question requires careful analysis of the given information, including calculations and comparisons of lease terms, sizes, and costs across multiple properties."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "854152_1999.txt", "docs_id": "854152", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

The correct answer is B because the documentation clearly states that \"The Partnership does not directly own any cable television systems. The Partnership's sole asset is its 76 percent interest in the Venture.\" It then goes on to specify that \"The Venture owns the cable television systems serving Palmdale, Lancaster and Rancho Vista and the military installation of Edwards Air Force Base, all in California (the \"Palmdale/Lancaster System\") and Albuquerque, New Mexico (the \"Albuquerque System\").\" This matches exactly with option B.
