Additionally, its lease doesn't expire until 1998, which may not be immediate enough for cost-saving measures.\n\nOption D is not the best choice because while the DeSoto property is the largest, it serves multiple crucial functions (corporate office, manufacturing, warehouse) and selling it could disrupt core operations more than it would benefit the company financially."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "310826_2019.htm", "docs_id": "310826", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "Item 2.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Banner Corporation has branches in Washington (62), Oregon (14), and Idaho (8).\n2. The total number of branches is 62 + 14 + 8 = 84.\n3. To have an equal number of branches in each state, the company needs to bring the number of branches in each state up to the highest current number, which is 62 (Washington).\n4. Oregon needs 62 - 14 = 48 new branches.\n5. Idaho needs 62 - 8 = 54 new branches.\n6. The total number of new branches needed is 48 + 54 = 102.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum number of new branches needed for an equal distribution. Instead of bringing all states up to 62, we can find a number in between that requires fewer new branches:\n\n7. The total branches after expansion should be divisible by 3 (for equal distribution among 3 states).\n8. The next number above 84 that's divisible by 3 is 87.\n9. 87 \u00f7 3 = 29 branches per state.\n10. This means adding: 0 in Washington, 15 in Oregon, and 21 in Idaho.\n11.
