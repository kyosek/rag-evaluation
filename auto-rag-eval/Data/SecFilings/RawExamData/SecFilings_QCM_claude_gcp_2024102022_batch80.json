According to the documentation, land use rights in China for industrial purposes are granted for a period of 50 years. The text explicitly states that \"This period may be renewed at the expiration of the initial and any subsequent terms.\" Therefore, Guanwei has the option to apply for a renewal of their land use rights when the current term expires in 2056.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no indication that Guanwei would automatically lose rights without the possibility of renewal.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the land use rights have a specific expiration date, and continued use requires renewal.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because in China, all land is owned by the State, and individuals or companies cannot purchase land outright.

The property is leased from the State of Hawaii under a 40-year commercial lease expiring in 2035.
