This is the number of homes passed, not the number of pay units.\n\nC) 87,570 is incorrect. This would be the number of pay units if each basic subscriber had exactly two pay units, but the question asks for the maximum possible.\n\nD) 138,355 is correct. This represents the maximum possible number of pay units. Here's why:\n1. The number of basic subscribers is approximately 43,785 (69,500 * 63%).\n2. The documentation states that basic subscribers can subscribe to more than one pay TV service.\n3. The maximum possible scenario is if every basic subscriber subscribed to all available pay TV services.\n4. The total number of homes passed (69,500) represents the theoretical maximum number of pay units per subscriber.\n5. Therefore, the maximum possible number of pay units is 43,785 * 69,500 / 43,785 = 69,500.\n6. Since each basic subscriber is assumed to have at least one pay unit, we add this to the maximum: 69,500 + 43,785 = 138,355.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the relationships between homes passed, penetration rate, basic subscribers, and pay units, as well as the ability to calculate and reason about maximum possible values."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "1639691_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1639691", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.

This was done through the creation of a special purpose entity that acquired the property from the financial institution for $73.0 million. This special purpose entity then leased the facility back to DreamWorks for a five-year term. This arrangement replaced the original operating lease that had been in place since the campus was completed in 1998.\n\nOption A is incorrect because DreamWorks did not purchase the property directly. Option B is incorrect as this describes the arrangement for the Redwood City facility, not the Glendale campus. Option D is incorrect because the company did not simply extend the original lease, but rather restructured the arrangement through a special purpose entity."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1120792_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1120792", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
