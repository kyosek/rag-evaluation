The headquarters in City of Industry, California is leased, with the lease expiring in April 2014 and an option to renew for two more five-year terms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases all store locations, not owns them.\nOption B is incorrect because the average store size for Torrid (2,494 square feet) is larger than Hot Topic (1,758 square feet).\nOption D is incorrect because the lease for the headquarters expires in 2014, not 2020, and it does have renewal options.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex property arrangements from financial documentation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1534675_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1534675", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.

According to the documentation, Remuda Investment Corporation changed its business plan on September 1, 2009, to focus on investing in mortgage loans throughout the United States, with the intention of purchasing performing, sub-performing, and non-performing commercial and residential mortgages at discounts and then liquidating them.
