United Power, Inc. indeed serves as an intermediary in the lease arrangement, which adds a layer of complexity to the Registrant's occupancy terms. This is evident from the fact that Future Property Limited leased the building to United Power, Inc., which then subleased a portion to the Registrant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Registrant does not have direct control over lease renewal options. The document states that United Power, Inc., not the Registrant, has two additional five-year options to renew its lease with Future Property Limited.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Registrant's sublease with United Power, Inc. is explicitly stated to be for five years, not 15 years.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the base monthly rent is $15,000, the document mentions a possible increase of up to 3% each year based on increases in the Consumer Price Index, so it's not fixed for the entire lease term."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1069533_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1069533", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.
