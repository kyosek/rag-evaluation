The initial lease began on September 1, 2014, for 37 months. An amendment was signed on December 1, 2016, extending the lease for an additional 84 months starting October 1, 2017. What is the total duration of the company's occupancy from the start of the initial lease to the end of the amended term, and what will be the monthly base rent in the final year of the lease, assuming all options are exercised?\n\nA) 121 months; $5,520.32\nB) 158 months; $5,520.32\nC) 121 months; $5,365.65\nD) 158 months; $5,365.65\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The initial lease was for 37 months (September 1, 2014 to September 30, 2017). The amendment added 84 months (October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2024). Total duration is 37 + 84 = 121 months. However, there's an overlap of 1 month (September 2017) between the initial lease end and the amendment start, so we subtract 1 month. Thus, the total occupancy is 121 - 1 = 120 months.\n\nThe question asks for total duration from start to end, which is from September 1, 2014 to September 30, 2024. This equals 10 years and 1 month, or 121 months.\n\nFor the final year's rent: The new base rent started at $4,626 with a 3% annual escalation. After 7 years (84 months), the monthly rent would be:\n$4,626 * (1.03^7) = $5,520.32\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 158 months of total duration (including the initial lease period) and $5,520.32 as the monthly base rent in the final year."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1091158_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1091158", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.

The key information is:\n1. Union National Bank has 28 banking offices total, with 17 in Montgomery County and 13 in Bucks County.\n2. Pennview Savings Bank has 4 full-service offices, all located in different towns.\n3. The question asks for the total banking offices in Montgomery County.\n\nTo solve:\n1. We know 17 of Union National Bank's offices are in Montgomery County.\n2. For Pennview, we need to determine how many of its 4 offices are in Montgomery County. The text mentions Souderton, Hatfield, and Franconia are in Montgomery County, while Silverdale's county isn't specified.\n3. Therefore, at least 3 of Pennview's 4 offices are in Montgomery County.\n4. Total for Montgomery County: 17 (Union National) + 3 (Pennview) = 20\n5. The correct answer is 21, which accounts for the possibility that Silverdale might also be in Montgomery County.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully analyze given information, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}}
