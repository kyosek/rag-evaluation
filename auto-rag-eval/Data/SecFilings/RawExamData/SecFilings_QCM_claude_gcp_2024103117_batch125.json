We also own an additional 2.6 acres of land immediately adjacent to our head office facilities. At present, we have no plans to construct facilities on our adjacent site.\nIn the U.S., we lease 43,000 square feet of office and research laboratory space located in Fort Collins, Colorado, pursuant to a lease that expires in June 2006. We own a manufacturing facility in Fort Collins that we acquired in July 1996 and we completed an expansion of this facility in the second quarter of 2003. The expansion increased the square footage of the manufacturing facility from 26,000 square feet to 58,000 square feet. As part of the building acquisition, we acquired two acres of vacant land, directly adjacent to the building. In August 1997, we acquired an additional 2.7 acres of vacant land in Fort Collins.

In Vancouver, they have 2.6 acres of vacant land adjacent to their head office.\n2. In Fort Collins, they have approximately 4 acres of vacant land (2 acres adjacent to the building and 2.7 acres acquired separately).\n3. We need to assume a reasonable building footprint for potential development.\n\nCalculation:\n1. Total vacant land: 2.6 acres (Vancouver) + 4 acres (Fort Collins) = 6.6 acres\n2. Assuming a similar building density to their existing facilities:\n   - Vancouver: 160,000 sq ft on 2.3 acres \u2248 69,565 sq ft per acre\n   - Fort Collins (expanded facility): 58,000 sq ft on approximately 2 acres \u2248 29,000 sq ft per acre\n3. Taking an average: (69,565 + 29,000) / 2 \u2248 49,282 sq ft per acre\n4. Potential expansion: 6.6 acres * 49,282 sq ft/acre \u2248 325,261 sq ft\n\nHowever, this is likely an overestimate as not all land would be developed. A more conservative estimate of about 50-60% of this would be reasonable, leading to approximately 162,630 - 195,156 sq ft.\n\nThe closest option to this range is 174,000 square feet."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1169138_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1169138", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "item 2 Properties\nAll land in China is owned by the State or collectives.
