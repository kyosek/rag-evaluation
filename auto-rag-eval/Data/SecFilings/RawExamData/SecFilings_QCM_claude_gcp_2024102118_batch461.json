The documentation explicitly states that if the Company were required to relocate any of its towers, \"the cost could be significant.\" This is due to several factors:\n\n1. Limited suitable sites: The number of locations in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited.\n\n2. Zoning and land use restrictions: These regulations can further limit the number of alternative sites available for tower placement.\n\n3. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations: These can also restrict potential tower locations or increase the cost of acquiring suitable sites.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the Company owns many of its properties, it doesn't own all of them, and ownership doesn't negate the challenges of relocation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as it contradicts the information provided, which emphasizes the limited availability of suitable sites.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation focuses on the challenges of relocating transmission towers, not sales offices, and emphasizes the importance of tower locations for market coverage."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1027443_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1027443", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.
