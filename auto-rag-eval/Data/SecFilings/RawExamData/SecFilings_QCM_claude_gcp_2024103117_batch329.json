The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The text states: \"As of February 3, 2007, the continuing operations of the Company operated 858 retail stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam, comprising a total of approximately 156,400,000 square feet.\"\n\n2.

To calculate the percentage of owned stores:\n   463 (fully owned) + 122 (owned building, leased land) = 585 owned stores\n   585 / 858 total stores \u2248 0.6818 or approximately 54%\n\n4. The total square footage is clearly stated as \"approximately 156,400,000 square feet.\"\n\nTherefore, option C correctly combines the percentage of owned stores (54%) with the accurate total square footage (approximately 156,400,000 square feet)."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1328015_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1328015", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.

The company tends to lease rather than own its properties, with a focus on relatively short-term leases. The size of the proposed facility (9,000 square feet) is similar to their existing research spaces (e.g., 8,500 square feet in Santa Cruz). The location in San Diego is consistent with their strategy of having facilities in various US locations. The 3-year lease term is longer than some of their current leases but still relatively short-term, allowing for flexibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because purchasing a large building for long-term use doesn't match their current leasing strategy.

Number of plants in Europe:\n   Total plants = 77\n   Percentage of space in Europe = 24%\n   Plants in Europe = 77 * 24% = 18.48 \u2248 18 plants\n\n2.
