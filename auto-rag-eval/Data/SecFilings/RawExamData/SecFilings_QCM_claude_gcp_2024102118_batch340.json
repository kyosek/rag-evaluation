In the most recent year's Q4 (Nov 30), the company reported a Gross Profit (Loss) of ($1,130,000). This is a significant shift from positive gross profits in previous quarters and years. When gross profit becomes negative, it means the cost of goods sold exceeded revenues, suggesting severe operational issues such as drastically increased production costs, inventory write-downs, or pricing problems. This gross loss directly led to the large operating loss of ($1,898,000) and ultimately the net loss of ($1,949,000) for that quarter.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Interest and Other (Income) Expense did become income, it was a relatively small amount and not the primary factor in the overall loss.\n\nOption B is incorrect because revenues actually increased slightly from the previous year's Q4 ($2,876,000 vs $2,778,000), so this wasn't the main cause of the loss.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while there was a small tax expense despite the loss (which is unusual), it was not the primary factor causing the significant overall loss for the quarter.\n\nThe gross loss is the most direct and impactful factor leading to the company's poor performance in that quarter, indicating fundamental issues with the company's core operations."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "99106_2000.txt", "docs_id": "99106", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

The company currently leases a 215,000 sq ft warehouse in Brockton, with a lease expiring in 2007. Additionally, they hold an option exercisable in 2001 to lease an additional 240,000 sq ft in the same facility.

This is most likely due to changes in the weighted average number of shares outstanding throughout the year.\n\nEPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

The original HUD-insured mortgage in 1992 was $2,997,800.\n2. The outstanding mortgage balance on December 31, 1999, was $2,867,486.\n3. We need to estimate the property's value. Since RPILP VI A contributed $497,911 for a 32% stake in 1992, we can estimate the total property value after the mortgage as: $497,911 / 0.32 = $1,556,597\n4. The total property value in 1992 would be: $1,556,597 + $2,997,800 = $4,554,397\n5.
