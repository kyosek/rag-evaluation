Total rent expense for 2008 is stated as $98,000.\n\n2. For the San Jose headquarters:\n   - Annual rent is given as $50,734\n   - However, this is based on a lease that expired in March 2007\n   - The company converted to a month-to-month lease after that\n   - There are mentions of annual rent increases based on CPI\n\n3. For the Salt Lake City lab:\n   - Annual rent is $25,000\n   - This lease started in September 2008, so only 4 months apply to 2008 (25,000 * 4/12 = $8,333)\n\n4. There's also mention of storage space rental, but the cost is negligible compared to the office spaces.\n\n5. Given these factors, we can estimate that the San Jose rent is still close to $50,734, maybe slightly higher due to CPI increases.\n\n6. $50,734 / $98,000 \u2248 0.5176 or about 52%\n\nTherefore, the San Jose headquarters rent represents approximately 52% of the total rent expense, making B) the correct answer.

The information provided suggests that the company has significant vertical integration in the paper industry. The large investment in paper mills (72% of property, plant and equipment) indicates that paper production is a core part of their business. Additionally, owning timberland and operating wood harvesting facilities shows that they control their supply chain from raw materials (timber) to finished products (paper).\n\nThis vertical integration can be advantageous for controlling costs and quality, but it also exposes the company to risks. The heavy reliance on natural resources (timberland) and manufacturing facilities makes the company potentially vulnerable to environmental regulations that could affect both their harvesting practices and manufacturing processes.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company appears heavily invested in the paper industry, not highly diversified.\n\nAnswer C is wrong because paper mills represent the majority of their fixed asset investment, indicating that paper production is likely their primary business, not secondary.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the company clearly has significant fixed assets in the form of paper mills, timberland, and harvesting facilities, rather than relying on outsourcing."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "30554_1997.txt", "docs_id": "30554", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 8.
