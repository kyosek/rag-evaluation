According to the passage, on February 2, 2000, JG Industries, Inc. closed all of its stores, entered into an agreement to sell seven of its eight department store locations to an affiliate of Ames Department Stores, Inc., and began liquidating all of its inventory and operating assets. This action followed the Board of Directors' decision on February 1, 2000, to cease operating as an ongoing concern and liquidate assets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company was closing stores, not expanding.\nOption B is incorrect because while the company did eventually reduce its workforce to 16 full-time employees, this occurred later (after April 1, 2000) and was not the immediate action taken on February 2.\nOption D is incorrect because the name change occurred much earlier, in 1985, not in 2000."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "719547_1995.txt", "docs_id": "719547", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "ITEM 2.
