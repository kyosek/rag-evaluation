It could just be that I need to play that mission a whole bunch more, but its making me wonder:\n\nAre some items only available in the \"event\" (ie Weapons Wednesday) missions, even though their tier is available in the standard missions? The in\\-game help suggests some cards can only be achieved by playing in the Arena, but mentions characters specifically (not promotion items).\n\nTo be super clear, is there any Tier 1,2, or 3 item that is not given though the standard promotion missions?

The information provided states that \"Sabaac Cards and the Medal of Alderaan are only in Arena Crates, so I'd say it's really rare since arena crates now only go up to Tier 3.\" This indicates that these specific items are exclusively available in Arena Crates and not in standard promotion missions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the existence of items only available in Arena Crates contradicts the statement that all Tier 1, 2, and 3 items are obtainable through standard missions. \n\nOption B is false because Sabaac Cards and the Medal of Alderaan are specifically mentioned as being only in Arena Crates, not in standard promotion missions. \n\nOption C is incorrect as the original text suggests that Tier 4 and 5 items are difficult to obtain without participating in event missions, contradicting the idea that they are easily obtainable through standard promotion missions."

Put `appService.service` in `~/.config/systemd/system/` and remove the `User=` line. Then you can control it with:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user start appService.service\nsystemctl --user stop appService.service\n\n```\n\n2. Add a polkit rule. I think this question is very close to what you're looking for: [systemd start as unprivileged user in a group](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504806/systemd-start-as-unprivileged-user-in-a-group/557634#557634). If you are on debian/ubuntu (polkit \\< 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/service-auth.pkla\n---\n[Allow yourname to start/stop/restart services]\nIdentity=unix-user:youname\nAction=org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\nResultActive=yes\n\n```\n\nIf you are on Arch/Redhat (polkit \\>\\= 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/service-auth.rules\n---\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if (action.id == \"org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\" &&\n        subject.user == \"yourname\") {\n        return polkit.Result.YES;\n    } });\n\n```\n\n3. `sudo`. I'm not a big fan of this because `sudo` shouldn't need to rely on a `NOPASSWD:` configuration and I don't feel that it's designed to be invoked indirectly. That's what polkit is designed for.\n\n```\n/etc/sudoers.d/sysctl\n---\nyouname ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl\n\n```\n\n---\n\nIf this is for software you plan to distribute, I'd definitely go with the polkit solution and do it per group (per the linked answer). It means you don't have to hard\\-code a username, instead add whichever users you like to that group to get the functionality."

Let me assume that $E$ is modular. Then there will be some level 1 Hilbert modular form over $F$ corresponding to $E$. But my understanding is that the cohomology of $E$ will not show up in any of the \"usual suspect\" Shimura varieties associated to this situation (the level 1 Hilbert modular surface, or any Shimura curve \\[the reason it can't show up here is that a quaternion algebra ramified at precisely one infinite place must also ramify at one finite place]).\n\nIf you want a more concrete assertion, I am saying that the Tate module of $E$, or any twist of this, shouldn't show up as a subquotient of the etale cohomology of the Shimura varieties attached to $GL(2\\)$ or any of its inner forms over $F$ (my knowledge of the cohomology of Hilbert modular surfaces is poor though; I hope I have this right).\n\nBut here's the question. I have it in my head that someone once told me that $E$ (or perhaps more precisely the motive attached to $E$) should not show up in the cohomology of *any* Shimura variety. This is kind of interesting, because here is a programme for meromorphically continuing the L\\-function of an arbitrary smooth projective variety over a number field to the complex plane:\n\n1\\) Observe that automorphic forms for GL\\_n have very well\\-behaved L\\-functions; prove that they extend to the whole complex plane. \\[standard stuff].\n\n2\\) Prove the same for automorphic forms on any connected reductive algebraic group over a number field \\[i.e. prove Langlands functoriality]\n\n3\\) Prove that the L\\-functions attached to the cohomology of Shimura varieties can be interpreted in terms of automorphic forms \\[i.e. prove conjectures of Langlands, known in many cases]\n\n4\\) Prove that the cohomology of any algebraic variety at all (over a number field) shows up in the cohomology of a Shimura variety. \\[huge generalisation of Taniyama\\-Shimura\\-Weil modularity conjecture]\n\nMy understanding is that this programme, nice though it looks, is expected to fail because (4\\) is expected not to be true. And I believe I was once assured by an expert that the kind of variety for which problems might occur is the elliptic curve over $F$ mentioned above. At the time I did not understand the reasons given to me for why this should be the case, so of course now I can't reproduce them.\n\nHave I got this right or have I got my wires crossed?\n\nEDIT (more precisely, \"addition\"): Milne's comment below seems to indicate that I did misremember, and that in fact I was probably only told what Milne mentions below. So in fact I probably need to modify the question: the question I'd like to ask now is \"is (4\\) a reasonable statement?\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an example of an elliptic curve $E$ over $Q(\\\\sqrt{997})$ of conductor 1: $\\[ 0, w, 1, \\-24w \\- 289, \\-144w \\- 2334 ]$, where $w\\=(1\\+\\\\sqrt{997})/2$ (thanks to Lassina Dembelle; this curve even has rank 2!). Shimura's paper \"Construction of class fields and zeta functions of algebraic curves\" suggests (according to MathSciNet) how to construct a Shimura variety of dimension 2 that isn't a curve but is associated to the relevant quaternion algebra. Shimura lets the quaternion algebra act on the product of two copies of the upper half plane instead of 1, and is able to show the relevant variety is defined over Q by using Siegel modular forms. Perhaps the cohomology of $E$ shows up there? I don't know."

Option B is too strong - while E's cohomology may not appear in common Shimura varieties, it's not ruled out for all Shimura varieties. Option D is incorrect because Shimura curves associated to quaternion algebras ramified at one infinite place must also ramify at a finite place, which doesn't match E's everywhere good reduction. \n\nOption C is the most likely correct answer. Shimura's paper suggests a method to construct a 2-dimensional Shimura variety using Siegel modular forms that might capture the cohomology of such an elliptic curve. While not guaranteed, this approach offers a potential avenue for the cohomology of E to appear in a Shimura variety, making it the most plausible option given our current understanding."

The **`nm`** utility is used to find symbols in an object file or executable. On most systems, **`ldd`** (`otool` on macOS) shows the shared libraries used by an executable. For the former, for example, I have a script ([*`listused.sh`*](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/listused.sh)) in ncurses which lists all of the symbols in its libraries and whether those are testable by a program using the libraries (see [report](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/ab10836a5884f5ca9a8c09110ce7486a9cbad9ec/test/README#L74) in [**`test/README`**](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/README)).\n\nThe `-C` option is useful (if you're interested in C\\+\\+ libraries), but the libraries may be *stripped* (lacking debugging information). However, the **`-D`** option (available on \"recent\" systems, e.g., almost anything updated in the past 10\\-15 years) provides symbols for *dynamic* libraries:\n\n* [GNU binutils](https://github.com/gittup/binutils/blob/252b5132c753830d5fd56823373aed85f2a0db63/binutils/nm.1), since 1999\n\n> Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.

This is the symbol table used by ld.so.1 and is present even in stripped dynamic executables. If **`\u2013D`** is not specified, the default behavior is to display the `SHT_SYMTAB` symbol information.\n\nThis is not a feature of less recent systems, at least according to their documentation:\n\n* [AIX](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/n_commands/nm.html)\n* [HP\\-UX](https://nixdoc.net/man-pages/HP-UX/man1/nm.1.html)\n\n(someone might know offhand the timeline for introducing the feature).\n\nI've used the feature in a few scripts such as [`analyze-curses-symbols`](https://invisible-island.net/scripts/readme.html#item:analyze-curses-symbols).\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* [Shared Library Symbol Conflicts (on Linux)](https://holtstrom.com/michael/blog/post/437/Shared-Library-Symbol-Conflicts-%28on-Linux%29.html)  provides examples showing how to use `nm` for this purpose.\n* [Chapter 3\\. Using Dynamic Shared Objects](http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/%7Etorgerse/Kokua/More_SGI/007-2360-010/sgi_html/ch03.html) from an old SGI manual mentions that `elfdump` has a relevant option:\n\n> If you use the \\-quickstart\\_info option, ld tells you if conflicts arise. It also tells you to run elfdump with the \\-Dc option to find the conflicts. See the elfdump(1\\) man page for more information about how to read the output produced by elfdump.\n\n* However, elfdump is not standardized (even to the extent that [**`nm`**](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/nm.html) is), and that **`-Dc`** is not found in other implementations such as [this one](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36870/elfdump-1.html), for Solaris.

Not hide them completely, but just make it a bit more obvious that their `__init__` functions aren't part of the public interface, even though their methods are.\n\nFrom the user perspective, it seems it would be logical for the classes to be in a separate module.

I just mean that if the factory functions are in one file and the classes are in another, then in order to understand how my code works, future\\-me will have to first look up `create_object` in one file, and then find the constructors it calls in a different file. There are many classes and many factory functions, so this would have to be done a lot. I find this sort of jumping back and forth taxes my short\\-term memory unnecessarily, and generally makes things harder to understand. I'd prefer to have a single file, containing square and rectangle classes, followed by functions that create squares and rectangles, followed by circle and ellipse classes, followed by functions that create those, etc.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: \n\n(1\\) Is there a way to create the `objects` module without having a separate file for it? I know I can create a module by instantiating `types.ModuleType`, but I can't work out how to declare the classes to be in the new module.\n\n(2\\) Assuming I can solve (1\\), would that actually be a sensible thing to do?\n\n(3\\) Or am I thinking about this the wrong way somehow? What would be the standard way to solve this issue in Python?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think it's sensible to separate the classes from builder if this causes cross\\-references (and probably cyclic imports to solve). If your goal is simply to expose what is meant to be public or private there are better ways to explicit that.\n\nThe easiest I can think of is to have your module structured as follow :\n\n```\nmylib\n|-- __init__.py\n|-- objects.py\n\n```\n\nWhere `objects.py` is exactly what you already have and `__init__.py` simply does:\n\n```\nfrom .objects import create_object\n\n```\n\nSo if a user imports `mylib` the only available symbols in it will be the public API.\n\nIf there are many functions like `create_object` following naming convention, you can automate their import into `__init__.py` by including something like the following in `__init__.py`:\n\n```\nimport objects\nimport inspect\nimport sys\n\ncurrent_module = sys.modules[__name__]\ncreate_functions = [(name, func) for (name, func) in inspect.getmembers(objects, inspect.isfunction)\n                    if name.startswith('create_')]\n\nfor name, func in create_functions:\n    setattr(current_module, name, func)\n\n```"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Python library where objects are represented as classes but users should not create instances directly, what is the recommended approach to structure the code and separate the interface from the implementation?\n\nA) Create separate files for classes and factory functions, with classes in objects.py and functions in __init__.py\nB) Use a single file containing both classes and factory functions, with no additional structuring\nC) Create a separate objects module programmatically using types.ModuleType and declare classes within it\nD) Use a single objects.py file with classes and functions, and an __init__.py file that selectively imports and exposes only the public API\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate solution according to the documentation. It suggests using a single objects.py file to contain both the classes and factory functions, maintaining readability and avoiding unnecessary file switching. The __init__.py file then selectively imports and exposes only the intended public API (like create_object functions), effectively hiding the internal class implementations. This approach balances code organization, maintainability, and proper API exposure without resorting to complex module manipulations or separating closely related code into different files."

Sometimes I'll have an answer accepted, and 5 days later (or sometime much longer) the acceptance is rescinded in favor of another answer. Occasionally I'm on the flip side of that as well.

Originally they were constructed by hand, but they also arise naturally in the real life, that is, theory of dynamical systems. (See, for example, this [http://www.math.cornell.edu/\\~hubbard/pendulum.pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/pendulum.pdf) paper of John Hubbard.)\n\nFrom dynamical construction it is clear that one can have a homeomorphism that permutes the lakes. For example, this expository paper [http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea\\-coudene.pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea-coudene.pdf) gives such a homeomorphism (in fact, a diffeomorphism) for lakes on the sphere $S^2$. The dynamics on the boundary of the lakes is chaotic. \n\n\\=\\=\n\nQuestion 1: Let $U\\_1$, $U\\_2$ and $U\\_3$ be open subset of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ with common boundary $C$. Assume that each $U\\_i$ is an image of an injective continuous map $\\\\mathbb R^d\\\\to\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that permutes open sets $U\\_i$ and is identity on $C$?\n\nQuestion 2: Let $U\\_i\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^d$, $i\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z$, be a disjoint collection of open sets each of which is homeomorphic to $\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that satisfies the following\n\n* $h$ maps $U\\_i$ onto $U\\_{i\\+1}$\n* every point in $\\\\partial U\\_i$ is periodic under $h$\n\n\\=\\=\n\n**Edit:** Below Andr\u00e9 Henriques has produced two examples when such a homeomorphism does not exist. Both examples make use of some local structure that cannot be permuted. It is still not clear what happens for \"abstact Wada Lakes\": are these examples exceptions or arbitrary Wada Lakes cannot be permuted as well? \n\n**Edit2** (Jan. 9th 2012\\) \n\n* In is clear now that there is no such homeomorphism if the dimension $d\\=2$. (See the comments below).\n* The answer to Q1 is also negative in higher dimension as explained in the reference given by Andres Koropecki.\n* For $d\\\\ge 3$ there are examples by Andr\u00e9 Henriques of open sets for which one cannot find such a homeomorphism. In general, Question 2 is still open.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In dimension 2, the answer is also \"no\".\n\nRecall the classical construction of the [Wada lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lakes_of_Wada.jpg).\nIn the linked picture, one sees little \"straits\" connecting the red/blue/green regions at stage $n$ with the extra windy strip that is added at stage $n\\+3$. For example, one sees a blue strait roughly in the middle of the picture, and a red strait (barely visible) on the upper left part. The location of these straights are free parameters in the construction of the Wada lakes.\n\n---\n\nNow I proceed to construct the desired counterexample.\nLet $P$ be a point on the boundary of the yet\\-to\\-be\\-constructed Wada lakes. And let $U$ be a fixed ball around $P$.\nThe straights can be picked so that:\n\n* The blue straights forms a converging sequence with limit point $P$.\n* The red and green straights all lie outside $U$.\n\nIn that case, there is no homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ fixing $P$, and exchanging the blue lake with a lake of another color. The reason is the following:\n\n* There exist arbitrarily small neighborhoods $V$ of $P$ such that all connected components of Red\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ and Green\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ intersect $\\\\partial V$ in exactly two intervals (taking $V$ be a metric ball will do).\n* For every sufficiently small neighborhood $V$ of $P$, there exist connected components of\nBlue\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ that intersect $\\\\partial V$ in at least three intervals (the components containing the straights)."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the existence of a homeomorphism h of R^2 that permutes these open sets and is identity on their common boundary?\n\nA) Such a homeomorphism h always exists for any configuration of Wada lakes in R^2.\n\nB) Such a homeomorphism h exists only if the lakes have rotational symmetry.\n\nC) Such a homeomorphism h never exists for any configuration of Wada lakes in R^2.\n\nD) The existence of such a homeomorphism h depends on the specific construction method used to create the Wada lakes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because, as demonstrated in the counterexample, there are configurations of Wada lakes in R^2 for which no such homeomorphism can exist. The key insight is that one can construct Wada lakes where one lake (e.g., the blue lake) has a fundamentally different local structure near a boundary point compared to the other lakes. Specifically, the blue lake can have arbitrarily small connected components intersecting the boundary of a small neighborhood in three or more intervals, while the other lakes only intersect in two intervals. This local asymmetry makes it impossible for any homeomorphism to permute the lakes while fixing the boundary. Since this is possible for any construction of Wada lakes in R^2, no such homeomorphism can exist in general for Wada lakes in the plane."

To prove this (using forcing) one seems to need a countable transitive model of ZFC. The texts I am reading avoid this by proving Con(T \\+ CH) for all (suitable) finite fragments T of ZFC using the Reflection principle to prove the existence of a countable transitive model of T. But doesn't the Reflection principle operate outside of ZFC? From what I understand it just shows how, given a list of axioms of ZFC, one can write down a proof that constructs a model of these axioms.\nAm I confused here or is there an other way to achieve this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reflection principle is a theorem scheme; each of its instances is provable in ZFC. \n\nThe following proof works entirely in ZFC:\n\n1. Assume Con(ZFC) together with not\\-Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) and aim for a contradiction.\n2. By assumption plus completeness theorem, there is a model (M,E) of ZFC.

(Because any proof of an inconsistency would be coded by a natural number, which is represented in M.)\n\nBtw, I think the sketch I just gave is not ideal since it seems to rely on the existence of infinite sets. The implication from Con(ZFC) to Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) can really be shown in ZF minus infinity, or even in a weak version of Peano arithmetic."

The implication Con(ZFC) \u2192 Con(ZFC + \u00acCH) can indeed be proven entirely within ZFC. The key point is that the Reflection Principle is not an external axiom, but rather a theorem scheme with each instance provable in ZFC. The proof sketch provided in the documentation demonstrates how this can be done using only ZFC, without relying on assumptions outside the system. It uses the Reflection Principle applied to finite subtheories of ZFC, the Completeness Theorem, and properties of forcing, all of which can be formalized within ZFC itself. This approach avoids the need for an actual countable transitive model of ZFC, instead working with what the assumed model of ZFC \"thinks\" is a countable transitive model of a finite subtheory."

C., \\& Steyvers, M. (2013\\). Choosing a strictly proper scoring rule. Decision Analysis, 10(4\\), 292\\-304](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/MerkleSteyvers.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is appropriate to use an improper scoring rule when the purpose is actually forecasting, but not inference. I don't really care whether another forecaster is cheating or not when I am the one who is going to be doing the forecast.\n\nProper scoring rules ensure that during estimation process the model approaches the true data generating process (DGP). This sounds promising because as we approach the true DGP we will be also doing good in terms of forecasting under any loss function. The catch is that most of the time (actually in reality almost always) our model search space doesn't contain the true DGP. We end up approximating the true DGP with some functional form that we propose.\n\nIn this more realistic setting, if our forecasting task is easier than to figure out the entire density of the true DGP we may actually do better. This is especially true for classification. For example the true DGP can be very complex but the classification task can be very easy. \n\nYaroslav Bulatov provided the following example in his blog:\n\n[http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log\\-loss\\-or\\-hinge\\-loss.html](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log-loss-or-hinge-loss.html)\n\nAs you can see below the true density is wiggly but it is very easy to build a classifier to separate data generated by this into two classes. Simply if $x \\\\ge 0$ output class 1, and if $x \\< 0$ output class 2\\.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)\n\nInstead of matching the exact density above we propose the below crude model, which is quite far from the true DGP. However it does perfect classification. This is found by using hinge loss, which is not proper.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)\n\nOn the other hand if you decide to find the true DGP with log\\-loss (which is proper) then you start fitting some functionals, as you don't know what the exact functional form you need a priori. But as you try harder and harder to match it, you start misclassifying things.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)\n\nNote that in both cases we used the same functional forms. In the improper loss case it degenerated into a step function which in turn did perfect classification. In the proper case it went berserk trying to satisfy every region of the density. \n\nBasically we don't always need to achieve the true model to have accurate forecasts. Or sometimes we don't really need to do good on the entire domain of the density, but be very good only on certain parts of it."

Because English is not my first language (Spanish is), I'd like some help making sure I index these correctly. \n\nFor example, in my index, should I use:\n\n* ***Description of the project*** or ***Project Description***\n* ***Benefits of this proposal*** or ***Proposal benefits***\n* ***Preliminary schedule of the project*** or just ***Preliminary schedule***\n\nAre there any rules or guidelines that would help me know the best way to set up my index for entries that could be listed in more than one way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, for section headers, I would favor the briefer forms, such as: *Project Description, Project Justification, Project Scope, Benefits, Project Deliverables, Preliminary Schedule*, etc. \n\nIn an actual sentence, though, either form could be used; for example, either \"Here is the preliminary schedule for this project\" or \"Here is the project's preliminary schedule\" would be acceptable.\n\nIn an index, you need to take a best guess as to which word the readers will look for when they want to find the information. I would avoid starting any index entry with \"Project\", as your index would be flooded with entries under the letter P. Instead, I would use a form like this:\n\n> **D**  \n> \n>  Deliverables for the project  \n> \n>  :  \n> \n> **S**  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, detailed  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, preliminary\n\nIt's not uncommon for an index to list multiple forms for an entry, but usually the page number is only given in one place (this makes the index easier to maintain should new information be added). So, you might consider using something like this, if you feel it would enhance the usability of the index:\n\n> **P**  \n> \n>  Project Deliverables: see *Deliverables for the project*"

Instead, use concise forms like \"Deliverables\" and provide cross-references when necessary. This allows for easier navigation and maintenance of the index. The answer also aligns with the advice to use briefer forms for section headers and to consider how readers might search for information.

It\u2019s likely the MOV (metallic oxide varistor) type. Its purpose is to catch and dissipate high\\-voltage spikes that can damage the power supply primary side.\n\nYour power supply can work without it, but it will be more susceptible to transient spikes on the line, so better to keep it, or if it\u2019s damaged, replace it.\n\nCommon vendors for these include Panasonic, TDK, Littelfuse.\n\nIf the MOV is fried, probably other things downstream are damaged too, like the input filter caps.

MOVs are designed to protect electronic circuits from high-voltage spikes or transients on the power line. They act as voltage-dependent resistors, conducting heavily when voltage exceeds a certain threshold and dissipating the excess energy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ceramic capacitors are typically used for filtering, not spike protection.\nOption C is incorrect as electrolytic capacitors are mainly used for bulk energy storage, not transient protection.\nOption D is incorrect because while Zener diodes can provide voltage regulation, they are not typically used for high-voltage transient suppression in power supplies.\n\nThe correct answer (B) accurately describes the component's identity and primary function in protecting the power supply from damaging voltage spikes."

Out of these, one band (suffixed as \\_maxcorr) is actually not computed by the servers but still exists in the output as a GLCM band with all zero pixel values. \n\nThis \\_maxcorr band creates a problem when band\\-wise normalization of the image composite is attempted by the unitScale() function as this function requires min value to be less than the max value.\n\nHow to tackle this issue? \n\nI thought of two possibilities:\n\nPrevent glcmTexture() from generating the \"\\_maxcorr\" band\nOR\nRemove \"\\_maxcorr\" band before input to unitScale() function\n\nHow to remove a specific band from an image in GEE?\nTrying reverse by using .select() function is not feasible as there are hundreds of other bands in the composite that need to be selected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to remove particular bands from an image, you can take the image's `bandNames`, `filter` that list to only the bands you want, and `select` those bands from the image:\n\n```js\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(\n    glcmImage.bandNames().filter(\n      ee.Filter.stringEndsWith('item', '_maxcorr').not()));\n}\n\nMap.addLayer(removeMaxCorr(myImage.glcmTexture()));\n\n```\n\n(The pseudo\\-property name 'item' is [the name used to refer to the value of a `List` item that isn't a feature with its own properties](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-list-filter) \u2014 here, a string.)."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Google Earth Engine, you need to remove a specific band named \"_maxcorr\" from a GLCM texture image before applying the unitScale() function.

This function uses the bandNames() method to get all band names, then applies a filter to exclude any band name ending with '_maxcorr'. The filtered list of band names is then used to select only those bands from the original image, effectively removing the '_maxcorr' band.\n\nOption A incorrectly attempts to select all bands using a regex, which doesn't remove any specific band.\nOption C tries to use the select() method incorrectly, attempting to exclude '_maxcorr' but not properly implementing the removal.\nOption D incorrectly attempts to remove the band name from the list of band names, but doesn't actually modify the image itself."

Could it be that the Brazilian phrase is a translation from American English or is there some earlier origin from Latin, Greek, mythology, etc? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For hundreds of years, in English and no doubt in other languages, flies have been cited metaphorically in connection with the idea of enjoying unseen intimacy or intelligence. Thus for example, in [*Romeo and Juliet*](http://books.google.com/books?id=c1MrAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA148&dq=%22In+carrion+flies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k4WPU7W-HI_6oAT484HADA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20carrion%20flies%22&f=false) (by 1595\\) we have this (in an 1821 edition):\n\n> *Romeo*.

Then I waits an hour, an' out she comes with the little kids, kissin' 'em, an' the biggest little kid arsks 'er 'er nime! If she didn't know 'im, why did she kiss 'im? An' before we'd got to the corner out comes the lean 'un, lookin' like a bloomin' corpse. Something must 'ave 'appened in that old 'ouse, an' I'll keep a lookout in the People and see wot it was. I'd like to 'ave been **a fly on the wall** during that there interview, I would. **A fly on the wall** with a tiste for short'and.\"\n\nSo we have five instances of \"a fly on the wall\" used in the modern idiomatic sense in the space of 52 years, all in novels by female writers\u2014the first English, the next American, the third probably American but with a special interest in Germany, the fourth Anglo\\-Indian (but living in England when she wrote her book), and the fifth American. This is not an especially random\\-looking group of sources.\n\nThereafter, Google Books finds matches from [1915](http://books.google.com/books?id=FUkgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA183&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), [1916](http://books.google.com/books?id=u-8WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA366&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and [1930](http://books.google.com/books?id=CgQU09UDVaIC&pg=PA10&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and then seven unique instances during the period from 1945 through1947\\.\n\nWhether Julia Stretton is directly responsible for popularizing the notion of being \"a fly on the wall\" in order to gather information or witness a private scene is difficult to determine; but it seems fair to say that the six English and American women cited above whose relevant novels appeared between 1855 and 1907 almost certainly deserve credit for popularizing (in English) that wording for a very old idea."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the origin and development of the phrase \"a fly on the wall\" is most accurate?\n\nA) The phrase was first coined in the 1920s in American English and quickly spread to other languages.\n\nB) The concept of using a fly metaphorically to represent unobserved observation dates back to at least Shakespeare's time, but the exact phrase \"a fly on the wall\" emerged in the mid-19th century.\n\nC) The phrase \"a fly on the wall\" was independently developed in multiple languages and cultures due to the universal nature of flies as unobtrusive observers.\n\nD) The idiom \"a fly on the wall\" was popularized primarily by male authors in the early 20th century as a literary device in detective novels.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that the concept of using flies metaphorically to represent unseen intimacy or intelligence dates back centuries, with examples from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (late 16th century). However, the exact phrase \"a fly on the wall\" in its modern idiomatic sense first appears in Julia Cecilia Stretton's novel \"Woman's Devotion\" in 1855. The phrase then gained popularity through works by several female novelists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While the concept is old, the specific phrasing emerged in the mid-19th century and was popularized over the following decades, making option B the most accurate statement."

How does it emerge from the Standard Model?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not accidental, at least in the sense that this term is used.\n\nThe accidental symmetry is the symmetry that is forced on you by the renormalizability \\- i.e. for a given field set you can't write the interaction that would violate such symmetry. On the other hand nonrenormalizable interactions or renormalizable interactions with extra fields (these two options are related) may violate symmetry. The example is the baryonic number conservation which is easily violated in many extensions of the standard model.\n\nOn the other hand the lepton universality is the property of the non\\-abelian gauge invariance. In qft the non\\-abelian gauge interaction is determined solely by the representation of the field and the coupling constant, common for all the fields. I.e. you can't have $SU(2\\)$ doublet interacting with $W$ boson 1% stronger than another doublet.\n\nOf course this constraint is weaker for $U(1\\)$ interaction, such as hypercharge field. But if you change somewhat $Y$ for some lepton, this may ruin the gauge invariance of the mass terms and the triangle anomaly cancellation."

In quantum field theory, non-abelian gauge interactions are determined solely by the representation of the field and a common coupling constant for all fields. This means that all lepton flavors must interact with the same strength with gauge bosons like the W boson. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Lepton Flavour Universality is not an accidental symmetry arising from renormalizability constraints. \n\nOption C is incorrect because violating Lepton Flavour Universality would require modifications to the fundamental structure of the Standard Model, not just introducing non-renormalizable interactions. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while the U(1) hypercharge field does play a role in lepton interactions, it is not the primary reason for Lepton Flavour Universality. The non-abelian SU(2) weak interaction is more fundamental to this property."

I've contributed some fixes to the origin (such as working around canvas rendering limitations on low\\-memory devices), but I've also added in a bunch of functionality that I wanted in the software, such as:\n\n1. `viewMode: 4`: When the image is rotated, it scales so that the entire image is always visible inside the container. The cropBox is also always constrained within the *image*, rather than just the *canvas*.\n2. `getCroppedCanvas` tiling: The ability to tile (eg: duplicate matrix\\-style) the cropped image on a canvas.\n\nHowever, the original author does not want to merge in this new functionality because he wants to keep his original plugin as simple as possible.\n\nI've tried negotiating and bargaining, but am just getting ignored.\n\nSo, I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to continue to maintain this public fork. Not ideal, but I really want that other functionality.

I know that I'm effectively working on a new version that is my own, but it's based on a foundation that was authored by someone else.\n2. Is it ok to masquerade as if this new fork is totally mine? eg: Replace links to the github.io page for the original project to my own in my forked README? It sort of feels wrong to not link back to the original, but the github.io has demos on it, and I'd like to demo the new functionality I'm putting in.\n3. Is there any part of a repo, be it the README.md, the site etc that I should totally replace with my own work to make it more...appropriately mine?\n4. Should I change the licence wording to remove the original Author's name, and replace it with mine?\n\nBasically, it doesn't feel like the fork is mine, even though all the new work is my own.\nI don't want to pi$$ anyone off, and the original work was really good.\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance that people can offer so that I do the right thing, which is all I want to do, really.\n\n**Update**  \n\nHere's what I did in the end <https://github.com/OddPrints/cropper> :\n\n1. Added the Credit and Why the Fork? sections plus the mention under the main blockquote.\n2.

He was discussing the very peculiar phenomena of dropping an oversized slinky and watching as the bottom of the slinky remains suspended in mid air. Tyson goes onto explain that the bottom of the slinky simply does not know to fall until the arrival of the top which carries information of the gravitational force \\- it is essentially oblivious to the gravity exerted on it (I may be butchering his more eloquent explanation a bit).\n\nI have more recently heard a somewhat simpler (and for easier to accept) explanation regarding the fact that the spring is constantly applying an elastic force on the bottom of the spring to keep it suspended. I suppose this would even delay the decent of rigid objects to a very subtle degree since there is always some elasticity?\n\nSeeing as the former explanation is some what more grand and makes for a better story, I would like to confirm which of these holds more weight.\n\nI have already done a bit of searching on this site and understand that gravity is limited by the speed of light, but I do not believe that this is necessarily applicable here, so as far as I know this question has not been tackled here as of yet.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably confused what he was saying a bit. The information that the bottom of the slinky is waiting for is the information that the top of the slinky is no longer supported. This travels down the slinky as the higher bits fall down and no longer exert a force (tension) supporting the lower bits.\n\nIncidentally in other circumstances the speed of gravity (which travels at the same speed as light) is significant. The standard example is if someone stole the sun it would take 8 minutes for that information to get to us. The light from the sun and the sudden lack of it's gravity would both take about 8 minutes to get here. In the intervening 8 minutes we would continue to orbit the place the sun used to be as normal."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A slinky is held vertically and then released. Why does the bottom of the slinky appear to remain stationary for a brief moment before falling?\n\nA) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information about gravity to reach it at the speed of light.\nB) The elastic force of the spring exactly counteracts gravity until the top of the slinky reaches the bottom.\nC) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information that the top is no longer supported, which travels down the slinky as tension is released.\nD) The slinky's material has a delayed response to gravitational forces due to its unique molecular structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The bottom of the slinky remains stationary because it's waiting for the information that the top is no longer supported. This information travels down the slinky as the higher parts fall and stop exerting tension on the lower parts. This is different from waiting for information about gravity itself (A), which travels at the speed of light and is not the limiting factor here. While the elastic force of the spring does play a role (B), it doesn't exactly counteract gravity throughout the entire fall. The slinky's material properties (D) are not the primary cause of this phenomenon. This question tests understanding of force transmission in a dynamic system and distinguishes between different types of \"information\" travel in physics."

Whitney's condition (b) is usually defined using local coordinates and specifically the notion of convergence in the usual Euclidean topology.\n\nIt turns out that if $M$ is a nonsingular complex algebraic variety and $S$ is a subvariety, then there is a canonical Whitney stratification of $S$ whose strata are nonsingular algebraic sets.\n\nMy question is: in the complex algebraic category, can one define the notion of Whitney stratifications using only commutative algebra?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a purely algebraic characterisation of Condition (B) due to Le and Teissier, see Proposition 1\\.3\\.8 of the paper\n\n*L\u00ea D\u0169ng Tr\u00e1ng; Teissier, Bernard*, [**Limites d\u2019espaces tangents en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie analytique.

Assume that $X$ is a complex algebraic variety (embedded in $\\\\mathbb{C}^n$ if affine or $\\\\mathbb{P}^n$ if projective) and that $Y \\\\subset X$ is a smooth quasiprojective subvariety. Then the pair $(X\\_\\\\text{reg},Y)$ satisfies Condition (B) if and only if there is a containment of ideals $$I\\[\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\cap \\\\textbf{Con}(Y)] \\\\subset \\\\overline{I}\\[\\\\kappa\\_X^{\\-1}(Y)]$$\n\nSome explanation: here $I\\[Z]$ means the generating ideal of $Z$, while $\\\\textbf{Con}(X)$ is the conormal variety of $X$ and $\\\\kappa\\_X:\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\to X$ is the conormal map.

What I am asking is whether or not I am able to use everything that is available to me at my level.\n\nFor example, as a monk, I have unlocked all four spirit generators. However, many guides have been telling me to use two generators, such as crippling wave for AOE damage and FoT for single target. What about the other two? \n\nI just do not understand how the system works, because it's not like I can level up CW/FoT to a higher rank every level.\n\nThe same question applies to runes. If I choose to use, say for example, Thunderclap with my Fists of Thunder, will I be able to use Bounding Light later on? Or am I stuck with Thunderclap?\n\nSorry in advance if this seems like a simple question; I am new to the Diablo series. And thank you for reading.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You may use up to a total of 6 skills at a time, one for each of your mouse buttons and then another 4 which may be bound to any key and defaults to the numbers 1\\-4\\. You can attach a single rune to each of these skills at a time. You can change skills and runes at any time, including in combat, but doing so triggers a cooldown on that slot. You may choose any skill for any slot, if you have Elective Mode enabled in the games options.\n\nGetting used to changing skills often is ill advised as at end\\-game doing so is penalised heavily in the form of resetting a buff you gain called Nephalem's Valor which improves the number and quality of drops you obtain through your game session. However you are very able to change skills easily at any time to any skill you have access to in the case that you find you just don't like the way your character is playing."

According to the documentation, players can change skills and runes at any time, including during combat. However, making changes triggers a cooldown on that skill slot. This allows for flexibility in skill selection while still maintaining some balance in gameplay. \n\nOption A is incorrect because players don't level up individual skills; they gain access to skills and runes as they level up their character. \n\nOption B is false because players are not locked into their rune choices and can change them at will. \n\nOption D is incorrect because players are not limited to using only two spirit generators; they can choose to use any combination of unlocked skills, up to a total of 6 active skills at a time."

It is asking for **translating C\\+\\+ code into Java**. In addition to this point, it is also a mix of low quality and lack of clarity.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I flagged the question for moderator attention:\n\n> This question is off\\-topic (translating C\\+\\+ code to Java), but I can't vote to close because it has a bounty on it.\n\nThe flag got declined with the following statement:\n\n> That doesn't make a question off\\-topic.

That statement alone is not enough information for a moderator to act on, to begin with it does not prove that the question is off\\-topic. It is merely arguably a strong indicator that it is so.\n\nIf you flag for moderator intervention, you should make sure you are basically laying out the situation on a silver platter such that the required action can be understood without first having to study the source question. It helps to specifically state what moderator intervention is requested. Should the bounty be removed? Should the question be closed? Something else?\n\nTo provide a background to that interpretation, I have this other meta question in mind:\n\n[How should questions that contain links to an infected/virus page be flagged?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293973/how-should-questions-that-contain-links-to-an-infected-virus-page-be-flagged)"

The specs you should be most concerned with are the output voltage (12V) and current (no less than 850mA \\- more is ok)."

Using it with 120V mains could result in improper operation or damage. The VA rating suggests it's likely a simple transformer-based adapter, which would output a lower voltage if used with 120V input.

It can either be set to SPI Motorola mode (0\\) or to SPI TI mode (1\\). (See the ARM reference manual page 695 [here](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/REFERENCE_MANUAL/CD00225773.pdf).)\n\nThe datasheet of the SPI Flash (available [here](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEIQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.gaw.ru%2Fproject%2Fdownload.php%3Fid%3D17019&ei=qEVjT4e1BYa48gP3z7iSCA&usg=AFQjCNGxHADH0jlYEafp0A31GarfzkfrFQ)) does not give indication regarding which mode I should use.\n\nWhat are the two different modes, and which should I use for the specific Flash chip I am using?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A brief glance at the ARM data sheet would suggest that the main difference between the TI mode and Motorola mode have to do with their handling of an output signal called SSPFSSOUT which many devices simply don't need. This signal is supposed to pulse high between bytes so as to indicate which bit of each byte should be considered the first. In TI mode, it goes high during the transmission of the last bit of a byte, while in Motorola mode it goes high and then low between bytes. The flash chip wants a chip\\-select signal which is held low for the entire duration of a transaction, so an output which goes high between bytes won't be useful for it.\n\nI would expect that even when SSPFSSOUT isn't used, Motorola mode would make data easier to read on a scope (since there would be a pause after every byte) but TI mode might be faster (since it wouldn't waste any time pausing between bytes). What's important, however, is to ensure that the sequence of signals the controller generates meets the requirements given in the peripherals' data sheet."

The choice between Motorola and TI mode depends on the specific requirements of the SPI Flash device, but Motorola mode is generally more suitable for devices requiring a continuous chip select signal. This is because:\n\n1. Many SPI Flash devices require a chip select signal that remains low for the entire duration of a transaction.\n2. Motorola mode handles the SSPFSSOUT signal (which can be used as a chip select) by keeping it low between bytes, which aligns with the requirements of most SPI Flash devices.\n3. TI mode pulses the SSPFSSOUT signal high during the last bit of each byte, which may not be compatible with the continuous chip select requirement of many SPI Flash chips.\n4. While TI mode might offer slightly faster communication by not pausing between bytes, the compatibility with the device's chip select requirements is more critical for proper operation.\n5. The datasheet of the specific SPI Flash device should be consulted to determine the exact requirements, but in the absence of specific guidance, Motorola mode is often the safer choice for SPI Flash communications."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the root cause of the issue where Firefox installed via Snap on Ubuntu 22.04 fails to open the Dropbox website when launched from the Dropbox application?\n\nA) A bug in the Dropbox application's code for launching external websites\nB) Incompatibility between Firefox and Ubuntu 22.04\nC) Limitations of the Snap package management system's sandboxing\nD) A file permission issue in Ubuntu's /tmp directory\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue is most likely related to the limitations of Snap's sandboxing. Snap packages run in isolated environments for security reasons, which can sometimes lead to integration problems with other applications or system components. In this case, the Snap version of Firefox is unable to access the temporary HTML file created by Dropbox, resulting in the \"File not found\" error.\n\nThe fact that the issue is resolved by installing Firefox without Snap further supports this explanation. Snap is a relatively new technology, and such integration issues are not uncommon as the ecosystem continues to develop and mature. While this provides better security and easier package management, it can sometimes lead to breakage of certain use cases that worked fine in traditional package management systems.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are less likely to be the primary cause, as the problem specifically occurs with the Snap version of Firefox and is resolved when using a non-Snap installation."

This is suggested by the following factors:\n\n1. The two users are colleagues, implying they might be accessing the site from the same location.\n2. There was a correlation in voting patterns, as indicated by the remaining user's reputation decreasing when the other account was deleted.\n3. The answer specifically mentions that if there was a high correlation in terms of voting on each other's activity, the vote fraud detection algorithm might have determined the accounts to be the same person.\n\nWhile the other options are possible reasons for account deletion in general, they are not supported by the specific information provided in this scenario.

Due to storage limitations, I want the repository to be empty initially and download packages once they are accessed.\n\n### Background\n\nI work a lot with local VMs. Anytime I create a new VM and install Fedora, a lot of packages are downloaded from the internet, and most of the downloaded packages are the same. To speed up the process I would like the RPMs to be cached on a server located on the same network.\n\nSimilar questions have been answered with a combination of `createrepo` \\& `reposync`. I do not like the `reposync` part, because I don't want to clone the whole repository up\u202ffront when I need only some of the packages.\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nI would like the server on my local network to act as an RPM repository for my Fedora installations. It should pass\\-through the metadata from whatever is configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`. The server should deliver the requested RPM if it is present in the local cache, or else download it and then deliver it.\n\nA less ambitious approach would be to configure a single RPM repository instead of `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/...` and just use an http proxy.\n\n### Update: 02 Nov. 2015\n\nI already have an nginx running on the network, so I played around with a combination of `proxy_pass` and `proxy_cache`. It kinda works, but IMHO it has more drawbacks than benefits:\n\n* a separate configuration for every repo configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`.\n* can't use `metadata` from `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/` because of alternate mirrors.\n\nI dropped the nginx thing and installed `squid`, as suggested in comments. `squid` works great for me. With the `store_id_program` configuration, I am even able to use the alternate mirrors and still hit the cache, no matter where the RPM came from originally.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here you can find fine\\-tuned squid.conf for rpm caching:\n\n<https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/blob/master/proxy/installer/squid.conf>\n\nYou just should modify memory and port setting."

From Googling I still can't tell which programming language I should use for this and whether I would need any external addons or just the functions built in to LibreOffice.\n\n(I'm happy to migrate this question to StackOverflow if it's decided that it really belongs there.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After 4 years, they still haven't implemented the suggested `FILTERJSON()`.\n\nThis is obviously not a real solution, but one that works for now, for very simple cases:\n\n1. Send a request to your API using: `=WEBSERVICE(\"http://example.com/v1/stuff\")` in eg. cell A1\n2. In cell A2 for example, add `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"rootProperty\";A1)+2;10)` (remember to change the separator characters (semicolons in my case) to match your locale in LibreOffice)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `MID()` will take a partial text from the full response\n* `SEARCH()` will look for the beginning index of the given text, eg. \"rootProperty\"\n* `+2` is the offset where to start reading the value (basically substring)\n* `10` is how many characters to read from the beginning of the text `SEARCH()` found (after the `+2` offset)\n\nSo if for example you get the following response in cell A1:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 12345678,\n  \"something\": \"Example\",\n  \"myThing\": \"Hello\",\n  \"another\": \"Not needed\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd your cell A2 has the formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1);13)`\n\nWhat the cell would have as value is: `myThing\": \"He`\nWhich is `13` characters starting from the first character in `myThing`, that you searched for in `SEARCH()`.\n\nSo obviously you wouldn't want to have the `myThing\": \"` part of it. To only get the value `Hello` from `myThing`, you would use this formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1)+11;5)`.\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Find where `myThing` begins (caveat: if there's two instances of the string, you'll get the first one)\n2. Return 5 characters from the offset. So: `myThi`\n3. Then offsets the beginning to be from index `11` (the `+11` in the formula)\n4. So it skips the first 11 characters (`myThing\": \"`) and returns 5 characters from there on, which is `Hello`\n\nOf course, it's still fairly manual, but at least one workable way for simple things. Good luck!"

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As a non\\-English speaker whose native language does not have articles I am always unsure about the use of them. \nThis time I would like to clarify the use of the article \"THE\" together with positions of persons. For example:\n\n> John Smith and **the** director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nIf I state the name of the person do I need \"THE\"? I understand that if I said just \"John and the director of my department went...\" \"THE\" would be necessary but does that change when stating the name also? \n\nSimilarly, do I need to put \"THE\" in this type of sentence:\n\n> **The** Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron announced changes in immigration policy.\n\nIf I don't need the definite article here then why so? Are the two examples equal? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use them with or without an article, but the meaning is ever so slightly different. When you use them without the definite article, *THE*, then you are using an official title. Grammatically it is like a name, it's a Proper Noun. In this case you need to use capital letters for the title: *Managing Director*, for example.\n\nWhen you use the titles or positions without an article, that's just a description of the person's job. Its a bit like saying *I'm a teacher*. So we can say:\n\n* Managing Director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nor:\n\n* The managing director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nThe first is a title, the second a description. When we are using the second form we have the option to use capitals if we want to: *The Managing Director ...*\n\nIn the Original Poster's example:\n\n* John Smith and the director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nWe need to use the definite article here. The reason is that *the director of my department* is a description, not an official title. However if you wanted to use a title you could:\n\n* John Smith and Director of Marketing, Adam Gray, both attended the\nmeeting.\n\nThis is similar to how we use proper noun titles like *King* or common noun descriptions like *king*.\n\n* The king of my country is an idiot.\n* King of Spain, Felipe VI was asked yesterday ...\n\n*Hope his is helpful!*"

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of articles with titles and positions is most accurate?\n\nA) The definite article \"the\" must always be used before a person's title or position when it's followed by their name.\n\nB) Capitalizing a title or position eliminates the need for any article, regardless of context.\n\nC) Using a title without \"the\" makes it a proper noun, while using \"the\" before a title turns it into a description of the person's job.\n\nD) Articles are never necessary when stating both a person's title and name in the same sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the nuanced difference between using a title with and without the definite article \"the\". When a title is used without \"the\", it functions as a proper noun (like a name) and should be capitalized. This usage implies an official title. On the other hand, when \"the\" is used before the title, it becomes a description of the person's job rather than an official title.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the definite article is not always necessary, especially when using an official title.\n\nAnswer B is oversimplified and incorrect. While capitalizing a title can indicate it's being used as a proper noun, the context still matters for whether an article is needed.\n\nAnswer D is too extreme. Articles can be necessary in some cases when stating both a person's title and name, particularly when the title is being used as a description rather than an official title."
