This is a reasonable estimate given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, with the corporate offices at $12.17/sq ft and retail centers estimated at $25.33/sq ft."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "912833_2015.htm", "docs_id": "912833", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nOur executive offices and support center are located in a 104,000 square foot facility in Watsonville, California, which we occupy under a lease that expires in 2016.
