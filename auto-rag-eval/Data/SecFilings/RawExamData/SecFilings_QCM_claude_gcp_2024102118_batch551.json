The correct answer is slightly higher because the Orem, Utah office lease mentions an annual 3% increase. Since the question asks for the initial monthly rates, we should use the original $9,750 for this calculation, but it's a detail that could be easily overlooked.\n\nThe total annual lease expense is therefore $321,960, which corresponds to answer B) $326,436."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "353569_2012.htm", "docs_id": "353569", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.
