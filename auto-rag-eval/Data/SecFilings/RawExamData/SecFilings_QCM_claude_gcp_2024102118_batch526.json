The total monthly rent based on the given information is $2,900 ($1,000 + $700 + $250 + $250). This amounts to $34,800 annually, which is close to the 2012 figure of $36,400 but significantly higher than the 2011 figure of $31,000. The most plausible explanation for this difference is that the laboratory lease in Riviera Beach was not in effect for the full year in 2011, but was for the entire year in 2012. This would account for the approximate $5,400 increase in rent expenses from 2011 to 2012.\n\nOption A is unlikely because a midyear move would not explain the full increase and would likely be mentioned in the property description.
