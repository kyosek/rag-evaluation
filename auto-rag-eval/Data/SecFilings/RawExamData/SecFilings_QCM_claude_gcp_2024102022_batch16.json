The documentation states that \"Although Saia owns only 37 percent of its service facility locations, these locations account for 52 percent of its door capacity.\" This directly supports the statement in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Saia does not own the majority of its locations; it owns only 37%.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the strategy.
