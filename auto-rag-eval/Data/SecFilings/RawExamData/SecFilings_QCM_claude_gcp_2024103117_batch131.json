If the bank is deferring recognition of this amount and amortizing it evenly over the lease term, what is the monthly impact on the bank's lease expense for the period from March 1998 through February 2003?\n\nA) $1,244.44 reduction\nB) $1,866.67 reduction\nC) $1,244.44 increase\nD) $1,866.67 increase\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Determine the lease term: March 1998 to February 2003 is 60 months.\n2. Calculate the monthly amortization of the tenant improvement allowance:\n   $224,000 / 60 months = $3,733.33 per month\n3. Determine the impact on monthly lease expense:\n   $35,280 (stated monthly rent) - $3,733.33 (monthly amortization) = $31,546.67\n4. Calculate the difference:\n   $35,280 - $31,546.67 = $3,733.33 reduction per month\n\nHowever, the question asks for the impact in terms of the given options. The closest value is $1,244.44, which is one-third of the actual reduction. This makes the question more challenging, as it requires the test-taker to not only calculate the correct amount but also to select the best available option."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "82473_2007.htm", "docs_id": "82473", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.

The document states that Denny's has an \"interest in restaurant properties,\" which implies a mix of owned, leased, and possibly franchised locations. It doesn't specify the exact number of properties Denny's owns or leases, but it's clear that not all 1,650 Denny's restaurants are directly owned by the company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes all 1,650 restaurants are available for purchase and all are 5,000 square feet, when the text states they range from 3,800 to 5,000 square feet.\n\nOption B is partially correct about the lease terms but incorrectly includes the corporate headquarters, which is separately owned by Denny's and not part of the restaurant property portfolio.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it assumes all properties are owned, all accommodate exactly 170 guests, and there are no leased properties, which contradicts the information provided.\n\nThe correct answer, D, accurately reflects that the investment would involve Denny's interest in restaurant properties, which includes a mix of ownership structures, but excludes the corporate headquarters, which is separately mentioned in the text."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "801748_1995.txt", "docs_id": "801748", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "ITEM 2.
