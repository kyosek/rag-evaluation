If the company wants to increase its total storage capacity by 150% from its current capacity, how many additional metric tons of storage will they need to add beyond the new Gujiao facility?\n\nA) 55,000 metric tons\nB) 75,000 metric tons\nC) 105,000 metric tons\nD) 125,000 metric tons\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 75,000 metric tons\n\nExplanation: \n1. Current capacity at headquarters: 50,000 metric tons\n2. New facility in Gujiao: 70,000 metric tons\n3. Total capacity after Gujiao facility: 50,000 + 70,000 = 120,000 metric tons\n4. Target capacity (150% increase from current): 50,000 * 2.5 = 125,000 metric tons\n5.

The net book value of the Company's owned assets and capitalized leases can be calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation ($14.5 billion) from the total cost ($29.4 billion), which equals $14.9 billion.
