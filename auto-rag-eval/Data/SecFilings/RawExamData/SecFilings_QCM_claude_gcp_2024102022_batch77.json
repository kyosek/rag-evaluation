This means there are approximately 22 months remaining on the lease (from January 2015 to November 2016). The annual rent is $150,000, so for two full years, the liability would be $300,000. Although there are actually 22 months rather than 24, the question asks for the maximum potential liability, which would be two full years of rent. Therefore, the correct answer is $300,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only accounts for one year of rent. Option C is incorrect because it accounts for three years of rent, which exceeds the lease term.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The bank has 10 branches: 7 in Holmes County, 2 in Knox County, and 1 in Tuscarawas County, totaling 10 branches across 3 counties.\n2. The text specifically states: \"All office properties are owned by the Bank except the German Village Branch, which is leased.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect because it mentions 11 branches and 4 counties, which is inaccurate.\nOption C is incorrect because it wrongly states that all properties are leased except the Main Office, which contradicts the given information.\nOption D is incorrect because it mentions 11 branches, which is one more than the actual count provided in the text.\n\nThis question requires careful attention to detail and the ability to cross-reference information from different parts of the text, making it challenging for exam takers."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "922475_2010.htm", "docs_id": "922475", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "Item 2.
