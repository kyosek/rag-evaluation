The documentation states that the company generally owned sites associated with major pipeline facilities, such as compressor stations. However, for transmission facilities (including transmission and distribution pipelines), they typically operated using rights of way pursuant to easements, rather than owning the land outright. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company owned some facilities, it did not own all transmission pipelines. \n\nOption B is incorrect as the company generally owned, not leased, sites associated with major pipeline facilities. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation specifically mentions that, except for a note reference, none of the properties were secured by mortgages or other material security interests as of December 31, 2008.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret complex property ownership arrangements typical in the energy infrastructure industry."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "763744_2009.htm", "docs_id": "763744", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
