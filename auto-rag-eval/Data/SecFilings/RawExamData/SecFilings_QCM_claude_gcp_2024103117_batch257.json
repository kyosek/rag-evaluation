While the 4th Quarter has a larger dollar amount, it's an increase from FY1997 to FY1998, not the other way around.\n\nThis question tests the ability to calculate percentage changes, compare absolute values, and pay attention to the direction of change (increase vs. decrease) across different time periods."}}
