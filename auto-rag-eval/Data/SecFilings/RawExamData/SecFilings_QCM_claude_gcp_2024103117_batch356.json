Properties\nThe Company operates its own facilities in Durham, North Carolina. Direct control over SiC crystal growth, wafering, epitaxial deposition, device fabrication and test operations allows the Company to shorten its product design and production cycles and to protect its proprietary technology and processes. In November 1997, the Company acquired its present manufacturing facility, a 30-acre industrial site in Durham, North Carolina, consisting of a 139,000 square foot production facility and 33,000 square feet of service and warehouse buildings. Cree is currently constructing an addition to the main production facility containing 42,000 square feet. The Company also recently purchased a 79-acre site close to its present facility for potential future expansion.\nThe Company currently leases space for some of its manufacturing facilities, which occupy 21,900 square feet in Durham, North Carolina.

To calculate the utilization rate, we divide actual production by capacity: 802,800 / 1,200,000 = 0.669 or 66.9%. This corresponds to answer B, 66.9% utilization.\n\nThis utilization rate suggests moderate efficiency with significant unused capacity. It indicates that the company has room to increase production without requiring additional capital investments in the finishing mill. However, it's important to note that the melting capacity utilization was higher (937,900 / 1,200,000 = 78.2%), which might be a limiting factor for overall production increases.\n\nThe question tests the ability to calculate and interpret capacity utilization rates, as well as draw insights about operational efficiency and potential for expansion based on these figures."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "1006264_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1006264", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReference is made to the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements on page for a listing of the Company\u2019s financial statements and notes thereto and for the financial statement schedules contained herein.\nManagement Responsibility for Financial Statements\nThe financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
