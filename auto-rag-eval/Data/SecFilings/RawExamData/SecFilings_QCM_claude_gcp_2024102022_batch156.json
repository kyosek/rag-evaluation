In 1999, the Company built out the remaining space in the Sunnyvale facility to consolidate all of its research and development laboratories and headquarter offices in one building. In 1999, the Company also leased a neighboring 33,400 square foot office building to house certain of its employees. The Company's annual lease payments for the Sunnyvale facilities are approximately $1,543,000.

The passage states that in 1999, the company consolidated all its operations in Sunnyvale, California. They leased a 52,000 square foot building and an additional 33,400 square foot office building nearby, totaling 85,400 square feet. The annual lease payments for these Sunnyvale facilities are mentioned as approximately $1,543,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the consolidation was in Sunnyvale, not Mountain View. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it confuses the details of two separate transactions. The Baltimore facility was sold in May 1999, but the $19.2 million proceeds were from the sale of the Mountain View properties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the company leased the 33,400 square foot building, not built it. Additionally, the capital expenditure anticipation for 2000 was approximately $1.0 million, not $5.0 million.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and synthesize multiple pieces of information from the passage, making it challenging for students."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "784011_2018.htm", "docs_id": "784011", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 1.
