This significant difference could indicate aggressive tax accounting practices, where the company may be using different valuation methods or recognition criteria for tax purposes to potentially minimize tax liabilities. The 31.4% figure represents how much lower the Financial Statement value is compared to the Tax Return value, which is the most appropriate way to express this difference in the context of potential underreporting in financial statements.\n\nOptions B and D are incorrect because they reverse the relationship between the two figures.

The correct calculation is:\n\n27,000 (Norfolk) + 17,000 (Jacksonville) + 2,300 (Killeen) + 1,100 (San Diego) + 1,500 (Tacoma) + 18,400 (First Community Finance branches) = 67,300 square feet total\n\nThe longest lease expiration date mentioned is 2006 for the Norfolk location. While some leases expire earlier (e.g., 2001 for Jacksonville), 2006 is the latest date provided.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overestimates the total space and doesn't identify the longest lease.

The document states that \"Most of these leases have an option to renew or to purchase the property at fair market value after a specified date during the lease term.\" Additionally, it mentions that \"Some of these leases will become month-to-month after the lease term ends in March 2003. We are in the process of renegotiating the leases.\" This combination of facts makes D the most comprehensive and accurate answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document specifically states that facilities of DDi Europe are not facilities of DDi Capital.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the executive office space is explicitly stated to be included in the 114,000 square foot Anaheim, California location.\n\nOption C is too broad and inaccurate, as only some leases are mentioned to potentially become month-to-month after March 2003, not all of them."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "1209821_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1209821", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nA description of the Partnership\u2019s properties is contained in \u201cItem 1.
