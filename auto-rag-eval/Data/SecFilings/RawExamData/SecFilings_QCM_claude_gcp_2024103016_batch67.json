The property consists of two building complexes totaling 185,000 square feet. If the company occupies 97,000 square feet for its principal offices and distribution center, and 48% of the property is leased to two tenants, approximately how many square feet remain unleased or unused?\n\nA) 0 square feet\nB) 3,200 square feet\nC) 11,600 square feet\nD) 14,800 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 3,200 square feet\n\nExplanation: \nTotal square footage: 185,000 sq ft\nCompany occupies: 97,000 sq ft\n48% leased to tenants: 0.48 * 185,000 = 88,800 sq ft\nTotal occupied: 97,000 + 88,800 = 185,800 sq ft\n\nThe difference between total square footage and occupied space is:\n185,800 - 185,000 = 800 sq ft over-allocated\n\nThis suggests there's an overlap of about 800 sq ft in the reported usage. To account for this and find the true unleased/unused space, we subtract 800 from the tenant-leased area:\n88,800 - 800 = 88,000 sq ft actually leased to tenants\n\nNow we can calculate the unleased/unused space:\n185,000 - (97,000 + 88,000) = 3,200 sq ft\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex property information, perform multi-step calculations, and account for discrepancies in reported figures."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1396838_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1396838", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The passage states that \"During the year ended 1998, the Partnership sold all of its remaining real property investments,\" indicating that it's no longer in the business of acquiring or managing real estate.\n\n2. The Partnership is described as \"currently addressing post sale matters,\" which is characteristic of a liquidation phase.\n\n3. The document mentions a \"final liquidating distribution\" that will occur after certain conditions are met, further confirming the liquidation status.\n\n4. The Partnership's main focus is on monitoring an environmental remediation at a previously sold property, which is a post-sale matter.\n\n5.

This strongly suggests that the company has taken on significant debt, using its real estate assets as security. This is a common practice for companies to leverage their assets to obtain financing, but it also indicates a level of financial obligation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while using assets as collateral can be a sign of financial strain, it doesn't necessarily mean bankruptcy. \nOption C is wrong because being a collateral agent doesn't imply ownership of the company. \nOption D is incorrect as the statement doesn't suggest a sale of properties, only that they are used as collateral."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1157647_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1157647", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nWe currently conduct our business through our eleven banking offices and twelve off-site ATMs. As of December 31, 2012, the properties and leasehold improvements owned by us had an aggregate net book value of $11.1 million.\nLocation\nOwnership\nYear Opened\nYear of Lease or\nLicense Expiration\nMain Office:\n141 Elm St., Westfield, MA\nOwned\nN/A\nLoan Center:\n136 Elm St., Westfield, MA\nLeased\nBranch Offices:\n206 Park St., West Springfield, MA\nOwned\nN/A\n655 Main St., Agawam, MA\nOwned\nN/A\n26 Arnold St., Westfield, MA\nOwned\nN/A\n300 Southampton Rd., Westfield, MA\nOwned\nN/A\n462 College Highway, Southwick, MA\nOwned\nN/A\n382 North Main St., E.
