However, it also explicitly mentions that these statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. This aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage specifically states that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\n\nOption B is too limited, as the passage indicates that forward-looking statements go beyond just intent and beliefs to include projections and characterizations of future events.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the passage does mention specific words as examples, it also states that \"variations of these words, as well as similar expressions\" and \"other characterizations of future events or circumstances\" are considered forward-looking statements, making this option too restrictive."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "849976_1997.txt", "docs_id": "849976", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.
