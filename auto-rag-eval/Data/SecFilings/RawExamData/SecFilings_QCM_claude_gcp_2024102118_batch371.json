The documentation states that the Company leases 34,559 square feet of office space in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and 47,400 square feet in Greenwood Village, Colorado. These two figures add up to 81,959 square feet of leased corporate office space, with the larger office indeed being in Colorado.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Company doesn't own all its facilities; it leases many, including corporate offices. Also, the 196,000 square feet in Washington, D.C. refers to three owned warehouses, not a single facility.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the Company does own warehouses in these locations, the total owned space is not 355,000 square feet. The correct total of owned warehouse space mentioned is 355,000 square feet (196,000 + 112,000 + 47,000).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it misrepresents some of the property details.
