A 10% expansion means adding 50 new stores (10% of 500). The additional space needed is 50 * 4,700 = 235,000 sq ft. The total after expansion is 2,350,000 + 235,000 = 2,585,000 sq ft. However, the question asks for the approximate total square footage needed to lease. Since 25% of each store's space is used for offices and storage, we can assume this might be owned rather than leased. Therefore, we need to calculate 75% of the total: 0.75 * 2,585,000 = 2,326,500 sq ft, which corresponds to answer B."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "773915_1995.txt", "docs_id": "773915", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "Item 2.
