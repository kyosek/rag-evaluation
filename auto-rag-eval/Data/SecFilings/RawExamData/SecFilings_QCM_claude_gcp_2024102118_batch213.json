Calculate the number of fully owned stores (not on ground leases)\n2. Calculate this number as a percentage of total stores\n\nFully owned stores = Owned stores - Stores on ground leases\n                   = 387 - 110 = 277\n\nPercentage = (277 / 846) * 100 = 32.7%\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of stores likely used as collateral. Since the company fully owns these stores, it's reasonable to assume they would all be used as collateral.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 45.7%, which is 100% minus 32.7% (representing the stores that are not fully owned and thus unlikely to be used as collateral)."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "71675_2003.htm", "docs_id": "71675", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 8.
