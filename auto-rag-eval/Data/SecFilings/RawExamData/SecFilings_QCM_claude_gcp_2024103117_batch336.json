The largest space (30,000 sq ft) has the latest expiration date in March 2021, while other significant spaces have earlier expiration dates (22,000 sq ft in 2015, 29,000 sq ft in 2017).

However, the documentation also mentions that the company owns approximately 2,400 square feet of office space in Hanau, Germany, which it is currently leasing out.
