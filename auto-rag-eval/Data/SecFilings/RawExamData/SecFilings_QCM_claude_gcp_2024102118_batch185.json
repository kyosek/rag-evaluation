The company leases most of its banking offices (35 leased vs. 18 owned), has reduced its physical footprint by consolidating five locations (four in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut), and expanded into Maryland by leasing an office in Baltimore for its LH-Finance division. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the bank leases the majority of its offices, not owns them, and the Maryland expansion was for an office, not a full-service branch. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it mistakenly states that all five consolidated branches were in Connecticut, when in fact four were in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the bank does not have an equal number of owned and leased properties, and it has expanded beyond Connecticut, including the new office in Maryland."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "835541_1998.txt", "docs_id": "835541", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nThe Company's manufacturing facilities are located throughout North America, Europe and Asia.

The Boston lease expires soonest (2021), making it the easiest to terminate without incurring significant penalties.\n2. It's a relatively small space (2,490 sq ft), so its loss would have less operational impact than larger offices.\n3. Acting on this lease first allows the company to assess the impact of downsizing before making decisions on larger, longer-term leases.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the 767 Third Avenue office in New York is small, subleasing can be complicated and may not be allowed under the lease terms. Additionally, it doesn't expire until 2023, so immediate cost savings might be limited.\n\nOption C is incorrect because terminating the largest lease (San Francisco headquarters) early would likely incur substantial penalties and significantly disrupt operations. It's also not expiring until 2024, so there may be better short-term options.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't address the goal of reducing costs in the near term.
