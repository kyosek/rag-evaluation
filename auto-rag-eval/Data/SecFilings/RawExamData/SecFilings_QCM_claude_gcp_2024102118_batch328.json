If the company decides not to renew the lease upon expiration, which of the following statements is most likely true regarding the company's financial reporting?\n\nA) The company will need to recognize an impairment loss on its right-of-use asset in the final year of the lease term.\nB) The company's balance sheet will show an increase in property, plant, and equipment as they prepare to move to a new location.\nC) The company will need to accelerate the amortization of any leasehold improvements to fully depreciate them by the end of the lease term.\nD) The company will recognize a gain on its income statement due to the termination of the lease liability.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a company knows it will not renew a lease, it needs to reassess the useful life of any leasehold improvements associated with that leased property. Leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term. If the company decides not to renew the lease, it must ensure that any remaining leasehold improvements are fully depreciated by the end of the lease term (April 30, 2018 in this case), which may require accelerating the amortization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication of impairment of the right-of-use asset. The asset is still in use until the end of the lease term.\n\nOption B is incorrect because deciding not to renew a lease doesn't automatically mean the company will purchase new property. Even if they plan to move, new property would likely be leased or purchased after the current lease expires, not before.\n\nOption D is incorrect because terminating a lease at its natural expiration doesn't typically result in a gain.

Critical function: The facility manufactures Spinal Specialties regional anesthesia devices, which seems to be an important product line.\n\nThe other options are less urgent:\n\nA) The headquarters lease in Lake Forest was entered in 1997 with a 10-year term and an option to extend for 5 more years, giving it a longer timeframe.\n\nB) The Northern Mexico plant lease was entered in 2000 with a 5-year term, making it less urgent than the San Antonio lease.\n\nC) The Infusystem subsidiary building is rented on a month-to-month basis, which provides flexibility and doesn't require immediate long-term decision-making.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze multiple lease terms, prioritize based on urgency and business importance, and make strategic real estate decisions."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1031029_2002.htm", "docs_id": "1031029", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.

What was the approximate net gain realized from these property sales, and what percentage of the total square footage owned by the Company (as of December 31, 1999) does the remaining property for sale likely represent?\n\nA) Net gain of $1.5 million; remaining property likely represents 25% of owned square footage\nB) Net gain of $1.5 million; remaining property likely represents 33% of owned square footage\nC) Net gain of $0.5 million; remaining property likely represents 25% of owned square footage\nD) Net gain of $0.5 million; remaining property likely represents 33% of owned square footage\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The net gain can be calculated by subtracting the net book value of the sold properties ($11.9 million) from the net proceeds ($13.4 million), which equals $1.5 million. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nAs for the remaining property, we know the Company owned two facilities totaling 40,000 square feet at the end of 1999. Since one property remains for sale, it's likely to represent half of this owned square footage, or 20,000 square feet. 20,000 is 25% of 80,000, so the remaining property for sale likely represents 25% of the total owned square footage.
