Q2 contributed most. 2003 total was lower than 2002.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: To solve this, we need to:\n1. Sum the foreign exchange gains/losses for 2003:\n   Q1: -\u00a36,417 + Q2: \u00a315,060 + Q3: \u00a32,058 + Q4: \u00a321,719 = \u00a332,420,000\n2. Identify the quarter with the highest contribution: Q4 with \u00a321,719,000\n3. Calculate the total for 2002:\n   Q1: -\u00a37,418 + Q2: \u00a325,079 + Q3: \u00a310,701 + Q4: \u00a36,657 = \u00a335,019,000\n4. Compare 2003 total (\u00a332,420,000) to 2002 total (\u00a335,019,000)\n\nTherefore, the total gains in 2003 were \u00a332,420,000, Q4 contributed the most, and the 2003 total was lower than 2002. However, the question asks which answer states that 2003 was higher, making B the correct choice."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1071625_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1071625", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.
