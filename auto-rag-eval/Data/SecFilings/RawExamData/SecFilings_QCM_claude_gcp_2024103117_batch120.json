Southern operates the facility for TPS and remains primarily responsible for lease payments if sublessees default.\nD) The lease agreement expired, and Southern now owns the LNG plant outright after exercising its purchase option.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, in 1998, Southern began subleasing the LNG facility to CNE Energy, who in turn subleased it to TPS. Southern continues to operate the LNG facility under an agreement with TPS. Importantly, Southern remains primarily responsible for the lease payments in case the sublessees (CNE Energy or TPS) fail to make the required payments. This complex arrangement demonstrates Southern's ongoing involvement and financial responsibility for the facility, despite not being the primary lessee anymore.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Southern is no longer operating the facility independently, having subleased it.\nOption B is wrong as the facility wasn't sold, but subleased, and Southern still has responsibilities.\nOption D is incorrect because there's no mention of Southern exercising its purchase option or the lease expiring.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to understand complex business arrangements and ongoing financial responsibilities in the context of utility company assets."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "797721_2012.htm", "docs_id": "797721", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.

This location is the most strategic choice for expanding rapid prototyping capabilities while minimizing real estate investments for several reasons:\n\n1. It's the only facility explicitly mentioned as having rapid prototyping capabilities.\n2. The facility is leased, not owned, which minimizes real estate investment.\n3. At 11,000 sq. ft., it's one of the smaller facilities, making expansion potentially more cost-effective.\n4.
