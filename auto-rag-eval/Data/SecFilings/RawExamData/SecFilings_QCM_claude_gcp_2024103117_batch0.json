The passage states that \"Although Saia owns only 32 percent of its service facility locations, these locations account for 55 percent of its door capacity.\" This indicates that Saia's owned facilities, while fewer in number (35 owned vs. 74 leased), represent a disproportionately large share of its operational capacity. This aligns with the stated strategy of \"owning strategically located facilities that are integral to its operations and leasing service facilities in smaller markets to allow for more flexibility.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because Saia does not own the majority of its facilities. Option B, while partially true about leasing in smaller markets, doesn't capture the full strategy.
