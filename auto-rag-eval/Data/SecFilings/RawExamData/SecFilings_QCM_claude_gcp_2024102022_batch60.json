The text states that the company currently occupies a 45,000 square foot office under a sublease that expires in February 2001. It then mentions that they have entered into a lease agreement for a new 188,000 square foot facility in San Mateo, which they intend to begin occupying in March 2001. This timing suggests they will move from the current office to the new one as the sublease expires. \n\nOption A is incorrect because they are moving to a larger facility, not downsizing. Option B is incorrect because there's no indication they will maintain both San Mateo facilities simultaneously. Option D is incorrect because while they are expanding in Dallas, the 8,000 square foot facility is much smaller than the new San Mateo office and is not described as the primary expansion."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1509190_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1509190", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.

Using the rate of the 10,000 sq ft space ($5.60 per sq ft annually), we can estimate the rent for 13,900 sq ft as approximately $77,840.\n\nTherefore, the approximate total annual base rent for all spaces is $442,000 + $77,840 \u2248 $498,000.\n\nOption B is correct because it accurately represents both the total square footage (68,900 sq ft) and the approximate total annual base rent ($498,000) for all leased spaces."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "1019671_2001.txt", "docs_id": "1019671", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2.
