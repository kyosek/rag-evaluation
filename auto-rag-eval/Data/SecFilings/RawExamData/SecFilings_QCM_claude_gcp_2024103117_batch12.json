As of December 1, 2009, only the $4,092/month (production center) and $2,733/month (remaining corporate office) leases were active.\n\nTherefore, the total monthly rent as of December 1, 2009 was:\n$4,092 + $2,733 = $6,825\n\nThis matches option A, which is the correct answer.\n\nOption B ($7,153) is incorrect as it includes the terminated lease.\nOption C ($9,153) is significantly higher and doesn't match any combination of the given figures.\nOption D ($6,233) is close but lower than the correct total, possibly from using an outdated rent figure for the production center."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "1071341_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1071341", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 2.

This is the correct calculation, eliminating options C and D.\n\nThe key distinction is in interpreting what this means for the condition of the assets.
