Determine the depreciable amount (cost of the building, excluding land)\n2. Use the given depreciation method (straight-line) and useful life (40 years)\n\nSteps:\n1. Total purchase price = $210,000\n   Land value (30%) = $210,000 * 0.30 = $63,000\n   Building value = $210,000 - $63,000 = $147,000\n\n2. Annual depreciation = Building value / Useful life\n   = $147,000 / 40 years\n   = $3,675 per year\n\nHowever, the question states that the federal tax basis is $162,000, which is lower than our calculated building value. In depreciation calculations, we must use the lower of cost or tax basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct annual depreciation is:\n$162,000 / 40 years = $4,050 per year\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, understand depreciation concepts, and apply the appropriate calculations while considering tax implications."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "1302573_2013.htm", "docs_id": "1302573", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "Item 2.

The company's current position of not recording a liability is based on their assessment of the third party's financial strength. If the third party's financial condition significantly deteriorated, it would increase the risk that they might fail to perform their lease obligations.
