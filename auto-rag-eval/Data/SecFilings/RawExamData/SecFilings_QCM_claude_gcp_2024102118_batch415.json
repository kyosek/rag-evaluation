In this case, the balance sheet shows that Gold Hill Corporation has no current liabilities (\"Current Liabilities none\") and no long-term liabilities are listed. Therefore, the total liabilities are $0. The total equity is $762,470.63.\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n                     = $0 / $762,470.63\n                     = 0\n\nThis results in a debt-to-equity ratio of 0, indicating that the company has no debt and is entirely financed by equity.\n\nOption B (1) would indicate equal amounts of debt and equity, which is not the case here.\nOption C (0.5) would suggest that the company has some debt, but less than its equity, which is also not true.\nOption D is incorrect because we have sufficient information to calculate the ratio.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to interpret a balance sheet, understand the components of the debt-to-equity ratio, and perform the calculation correctly even in an unusual scenario where there is no debt."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1085280_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1085280", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "ITEM 2.
