The ROU asset is typically equal to the lease liability at adoption, adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs.\n\nThe fact that the ROU asset is $2.89 million suggests that the lease liability is likely close to this amount. However, the lease liability is often slightly higher than the ROU asset at adoption due to adjustments like prepaid rent or lease incentives.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of some of the leases (up to 11 years), it's probable that the total undiscounted future lease payments exceed the ROU asset value. When discounted to present value, this would likely result in a lease liability greater than the ROU asset.\n\nOptions A and B are unlikely because the lease liability is typically not less than or exactly equal to the ROU asset at adoption.
