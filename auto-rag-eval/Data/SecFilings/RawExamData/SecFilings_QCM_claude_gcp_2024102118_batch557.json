The Bryan facilities run second shift operations on selected toy items during seasonal demand peaks and the Stryker, Ohio plant is normally scheduled on the basis of three-shift operations.

The document explicitly states, \"Because of the seasonal nature of its business and the fact that a portion of its manufacturing facilities operate on a one-shift or limited two-shift basis, the Registrant's facilities have operated below maximum productive capacity in recent years, including 1995.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the information indicates that production is primarily on a one-shift basis at Bryan, with second shifts only during peak seasons, and three shifts at Stryker. It does not operate at full capacity year-round.\n\nOption B directly contradicts the statement in the document about operating below maximum capacity.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it reverses the shift information.

The headquarters is 48,700 sq ft.\n2. Regional offices range from 280 to 4,900 sq ft.\n3. Total rental expense for 2001 was $2,150,841.\n4. We need to estimate the total square footage of regional offices.\n\nLet's assume an average of 2,590 sq ft for each regional office (midpoint between 280 and 4,900). With 4 regional offices, the total regional square footage would be approximately 10,360 sq ft.\n\nTotal square footage: 48,700 (HQ) + 10,360 (regional) = 59,060 sq ft\n\nRegional office percentage of total space: 10,360 / 59,060 \u2248 17.5%\n\nAssuming rental costs are proportional to square footage, the regional offices would account for about 17.5% of the total rental expense.\n\n17.5% of $2,150,841 \u2248 $376,397\n\nTo account for potential variations and the fact that smaller offices might have higher per-square-foot costs, we can estimate this might represent about 25% of the total rental expense.\n\nThis question tests the ability to make reasonable assumptions, perform calculations with limited data, and apply critical thinking to a complex real-estate scenario."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "878522_2004.htm", "docs_id": "878522", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 2.
