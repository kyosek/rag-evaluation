Calculate the total rent paid over 10 years if they don't purchase.\n2. Subtract the purchase price from the total rent to find the savings.\n\nThe lease states that the rent escalates over the life of the lease from $16,000 to $35,000 per month. Without more specific information on the escalation schedule, we can assume a linear increase over 10 years.\n\nAverage monthly rent = ($16,000 + $35,000) / 2 = $25,500\nTotal rent over 10 years = $25,500 * 12 months * 10 years = $3,060,000\n\nIf they purchase for $2,600,000, the savings would be:\n$3,060,000 - $2,600,000 = $460,000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum amount they would save. This occurs if they paid only $16,000 per month for the entire 10-year period without purchasing:\n\nMaximum total rent = $16,000 * 12 months * 10 years = $1,920,000\nMaximum savings = $6,800,000 - $2,600,000 = $4,200,000\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount they could save over 10 years is $4,200,000 (option D)."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "1332551_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1332551", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania:\nWe maintain offices through our Manager.
