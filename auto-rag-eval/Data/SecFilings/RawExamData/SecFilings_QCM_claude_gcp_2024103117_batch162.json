Given that the company owns half of its distribution centers, let x be the total number of centers. Then x/2 are owned.\n\n2. The total space of owned centers is (x/2) * 120,000 sq ft (average size of owned centers).\n\n3. If this represents half of the total space, then the total space is 2 * (x/2) * 120,000 = 120,000x sq ft.\n\n4. We know the total space is 3.9 million sq ft, so:\n   120,000x = 3,900,000\n\n5.

The company's assessment that no liability needs to be recorded is based on their evaluation of the current financial strength of the third party that assumed the lease. If this financial strength were to significantly deteriorate, it would increase the risk that the third party might fail to perform its lease obligations.
