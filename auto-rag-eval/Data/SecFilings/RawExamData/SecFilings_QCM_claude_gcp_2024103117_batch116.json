On June 29, 2009, Insight Management completed a reverse triangular merger with Microresearch Corporation. Pursuant to the agreement, Microresearch shareholders received 1.5 ISIM shares for each share they own in Microresearch Corporation. Prior Insight Management shareholders did not change their holdings in Insight Management. The address of our website is www.insightmanagementcorp.com.\nInsight Management Corporation is a public holding company focused on the energy industry. The company's strategic plan is to acquire oil and gas services businesses with substantial revenues, profitable operations, established customers and proven management teams. Insight Management creates synergistic alliances, provides access to capital markets and capitalizes on the expertise of its subsidiaries to achieve company growth and value for shareholders.\nITEM 1A."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Insight Management Corporation completed a reverse triangular merger with Microresearch Corporation on June 29, 2009. As a result of this merger, what happened to the shareholders of Microresearch Corporation?\n\nA) They received 1 ISIM share for each share they owned in Microresearch Corporation\nB) They received 1.5 ISIM shares for each share they owned in Microresearch Corporation\nC) They had to surrender their Microresearch Corporation shares without compensation\nD) They retained their Microresearch Corporation shares with no changes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, \"Pursuant to the agreement, Microresearch shareholders received 1.5 ISIM shares for each share they own in Microresearch Corporation.\" This clearly indicates that option B is correct. Option A is incorrect because the exchange ratio was 1.5, not 1. Option C is incorrect because shareholders did receive compensation in the form of ISIM shares. Option D is incorrect because the merger resulted in a change in shareholding, not retention of original shares."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "8063_2008.htm", "docs_id": "8063", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nThe Company owns manufacturing and office facilities of approximately 125,000 square feet in the Buffalo, New York area.

The company maintains laboratories in Australia, Brazil, China, France, Mexico, Sweden, and Turkey (7 countries outside the US). It has a joint venture in Japan called Nagase-Landauer that owns a manufacturing facility.
