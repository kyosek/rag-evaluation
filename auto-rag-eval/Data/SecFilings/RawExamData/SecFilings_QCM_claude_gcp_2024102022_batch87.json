Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's distribution centers?\n\nA) The New Britain facility is the largest and most efficient distribution center.\nB) The Jacksonville facility is the oldest and least efficient distribution center.\nC) The Lemont facility has the smallest square footage but is well-equipped for operating efficiencies.\nD) The Visalia facility is the second largest and was constructed within the last eight years.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThis question requires careful analysis of the given information and attention to detail. Let's break down why C is correct and the others are incorrect:\n\nA) Incorrect. While New Britain is the largest (92,000 sq ft), it is described as \"less favorably arranged for operating efficiencies\" compared to the newer facilities.\n\nB) Incorrect. Jacksonville is not the oldest; the text states that Jacksonville, Visalia, and Lemont \"have been constructed within the last eight years.\" The oldest is likely New Britain, as it's described as the \"older\" facility.\n\nC) Correct. Lemont is indeed the smallest at 44,000 sq ft, and the text states that Jacksonville, Visalia, and Lemont \"have been constructed within the last eight years and are well equipped and laid out for operating efficiencies.\"\n\nD) Incorrect. While Visalia was constructed within the last eight years, it is not the second largest.
