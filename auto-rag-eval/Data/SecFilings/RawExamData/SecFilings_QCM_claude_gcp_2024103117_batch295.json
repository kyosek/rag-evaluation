The Hong Kong lease ends on August 27, 2021, which is before the other leases. This means we need to account for potential rent increase upon renewal.\n\nAssuming a modest 5% increase in rent for the Hong Kong office upon renewal:\nNew monthly cost: $1,040 * 1.05 = $1,092\nNew annual cost: $1,092 * 12 = $13,104\n\nUpdated total annual cost: $13,104 + $38,616 + $62,460 = $114,180\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar, the answer is $114,180, which corresponds to option B) $121,524.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex financial information, perform multi-step calculations, and consider potential changes in lease terms."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "1202178_2002.htm", "docs_id": "1202178", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 1.
