The document states that a two-for-one stock split was declared on April 1, 1996, and paid on May 13, 1996. In a two-for-one stock split, each existing share is split into two shares, so an investor owning 1,000 shares before the split would own 2,000 shares after the split.\n\nRegarding the EPS calculation, the document specifically mentions that \"All quarters have been restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split.\" This means that the EPS figures for quarters after the split would be adjusted to account for the increased number of shares. In a two-for-one split, the EPS is typically halved because the earnings are now spread across twice as many shares.\n\nThe document also notes that \"Earnings per common share are computed independently for each of the quarters.\" This doesn't change the fact that the EPS would be halved due to the split, but it emphasizes that each quarter's EPS is calculated separately, rather than being derived from an annual figure.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they misstate either the number of shares after the split or the effect on EPS.

The failure rate of 11.4% (5/44) is present but not emphasized in the question, eliminating B. Answer C is incorrect because it only considers the producing wells (38) out of the productive wells (39), ignoring the abandoned wells and thus overstating the success rate. \n\nThe 89.7% success rate indicates a moderately aggressive exploration strategy.
