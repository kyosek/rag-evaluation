For the corporate headquarters in Paramus, NJ:\n   - The annual rent is $550,000 through November 30, 2013.\n   - After this date, the adjacent business suite lease expires.\n   - The document doesn't specify the separate cost for the adjacent suite, so we can't determine the exact rent after November 30, 2013, but we know it will be less than $550,000.\n\n2.

Grotewohl is the sole general partner and the partnership acquired properties outright rather than leasing them.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states that Grotewohl Management Services, Inc. is the general partner of the Partnership, and it is 50% owned by Philip B. Grotewohl. Additionally, the offering consisted of 5,000 units of limited partnership interest sold at $1,000 per unit. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the general partner is not wholly owned by Philip B. Grotewohl (only 50%), and the number and price of units are wrong. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the partnership was formed under California law, not Nevada law, and the amount raised ($5 million) does not match the stated $10 million. \n\nOption D is incorrect because Philip B.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The total square footage is 24,500 + 48,600 = 73,100 sq ft\n2. Both facilities are leased from MDC Land LLC (not directly from the Moshayedi individuals)\n3. The base rents are approximately $17,000 and $33,000 per month, totaling $50,000, but the question asks for approximate total, so $51,000 is the closest match among the options\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect due to the wrong total base rent or square footage. Option B is incorrect on all three aspects (square footage, lessor, and rent amount)."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "225971_1993.txt", "docs_id": "225971", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1993", "text": "Item 2.
