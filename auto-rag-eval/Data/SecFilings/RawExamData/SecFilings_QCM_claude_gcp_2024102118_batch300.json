Of the total 5.4 million square feet of space, 4.2 million square feet are owned. What percentage of the company's total facility space is leased, and what is the maximum typical lease term for the majority of these leased facilities?\n\nA) 18.5% leased; maximum typical lease term of 5 years\nB) 22.2% leased; maximum typical lease term of 10 years\nC) 22.2% leased; maximum typical lease term of 5 years\nD) 18.5% leased; maximum typical lease term of 10 years\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: To calculate the percentage of leased space, we first determine the leased square footage by subtracting owned space from total space: 5.4 million - 4.2 million = 1.2 million square feet leased. The percentage of leased space is (1.2 million / 5.4 million) * 100 = 22.2%.\n\nThe document states that \"The leased facilities are for the most part occupied under leases for terms ranging from one month to 10 years, a majority of which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at our option.\" This indicates that while some leases may extend up to 10 years, the maximum typical lease term for the majority is 10 years.\n\nOption B correctly combines the 22.2% leased space calculation with the maximum 10-year lease term mentioned in the document."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "879993_2004.htm", "docs_id": "879993", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
