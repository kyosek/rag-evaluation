Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's property situation as of the time this report was filed?\n\nA) The company's headquarters lease in Irvine, California is set to expire within the next year, with no option for extension.\n\nB) The company is currently utilizing all of its leased properties for active operations.\n\nC) The largest facility leased by the company is its headquarters in Irvine, California, which is approximately 35,528 square feet.\n\nD) The company's lease expenses are expected to decrease significantly after June 1, 2001, due to the expiration of multiple leases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because the headquarters lease in Irvine expires on January 31, 2003, which is not within the next year from the time of the report. Additionally, there is an option to extend for five years.\n\nB) is incorrect because the document mentions a 27,680 square foot facility in Dublin, Ohio that is vacant.\n\nC) is correct. The headquarters in Irvine, California is explicitly stated to be 35,528 square feet, which is the largest facility mentioned in the document.\n\nD) is incorrect because while the Dublin, Ohio lease expires on June 1, 2001, there's no indication that multiple leases are expiring or that expenses will decrease significantly. The headquarters lease, which is the most expensive, continues until 2003.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex property information, compare facility sizes, and understand lease terms and their implications."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1028734_2001.htm", "docs_id": "1028734", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 8.
