The passage states that \"FMC owns the land and mineral rights to the Salar del Hombre Muerto lithium reserves in Argentina\" and \"Trona ore, used for soda ash production in Green River, WY, is mined primarily from property held under long-term leases.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all facilities are owned; some are leased, and the trona ore deposits are specifically mentioned as being held under long-term leases.\n\nOption B is inaccurate as it mixes up the locations. The phosphorus plant is in Pocatello, Idaho, supplied by local shale and ore deposits, while the lithium reserves are in Argentina.\n\nOption C is wrong because the major research facility is in Princeton, NJ, not Philadelphia.

Let's break down the changes:\n\n1. New Woburn facility: 82,000 sq ft\n   Sublet space: 8,900 sq ft\n   Net Woburn space: 82,000 - 8,900 = 73,100 sq ft\n\n2.

Net change:\n   New space - Old space = 73,100 - 95,000 = -21,900 sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the change assuming they successfully release the Andover lease. So we need to subtract the Andover space from our calculation:\n\n   -21,900 + 33,000 = 11,100 sq ft\n\nThe closest option to this figure is a decrease of 13,000 square feet (option A).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex real estate information, perform multi-step calculations, and select the closest approximation from the given options."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "318833_2008.htm", "docs_id": "318833", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.
