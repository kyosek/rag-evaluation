The documentation states that \"Many of the leases for recently opened stores permit the Company to terminate the lease within two to three years after commencement of the lease term if sales fail to meet minimum thresholds.\" This provides flexibility for newer locations. Additionally, it's mentioned that \"Approximately 85% of the leases have percentage rent clauses,\" which aligns with the statement in option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases all of its stores, not owns them. The $12.25 per square foot is the average base rent, not occupancy cost.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the distribution center was designed to handle 1,000 stores, not 2,000.\n\nOption C is incorrect because approximately 46% of leases contain renewal options, meaning about 54% do not.

The company plans to sublease the Arlington facility after its temporary reopening, indicating a desire to reduce operations there. The Linden facility is the largest (495,000 sq ft) with a long-term lease until 2026 and extension options, suggesting it's a key location.

The total number of new branches needed is 54 + 52 + 49 = 155. \n\nIf this expansion is done equally across all four states, each state would get 155 \u00f7 4 = 38.75 new branches. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, this means 39 new branches per state.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about Ohio. Since Ohio already has 3 branches, it would need 20 new branches to reach the target of 23 (3 + 20 = 23).\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex information, perform multi-step calculations, and think critically about expansion strategies."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "913610_2001.htm", "docs_id": "913610", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM\n2.

Subtract the leased area from the total to find the owned area\n\nStep 1: 95% of 13.3 million = 0.95 \u00d7 13,300,000 = 12,635,000 sq ft (leased)\nStep 2: Total - Leased = Owned\n13,300,000 - 12,635,000 = 665,000 sq ft (owned)\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and extract relevant information, perform percentage calculations, and work with large numbers.
