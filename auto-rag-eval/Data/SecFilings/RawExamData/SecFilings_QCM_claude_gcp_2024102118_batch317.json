The data shows that the Registrant's principal product (life insurance) consistently accounts for around 80-84% of total sales from 1988 to 1997. There is a slight downward trend observed, from 84.18% in 1988 to 81.43% in 1997.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the data shows a slight overall decrease, not an increase, in the percentage of life insurance sales over the decade.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the company does sell annuity contracts including variable annuities, the documentation clearly states that life insurance is the principal product.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the employee count is only provided for December 31, 1997, and there's no information about previous years.
