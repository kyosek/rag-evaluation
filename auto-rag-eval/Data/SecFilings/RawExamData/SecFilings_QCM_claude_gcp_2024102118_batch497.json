The data shows an unusual pattern in the third quarter of 1996. Despite having lower income from operations ($7,512,000) compared to the second quarter ($10,134,000), the third quarter had the highest net income ($14,291,000) of any quarter that year. This discrepancy between operating income and net income suggests there might have been significant non-operating gains, such as investment income, sale of assets, or tax benefits that contributed to the higher net income.\n\nThis pattern is noteworthy because it doesn't follow the typical relationship between operating income and net income. It could indicate that the company had substantial non-operating activities or received tax benefits in that quarter. It might also suggest that investors should look closer at the company's financial statements to understand the source of this anomaly.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't capture this unusual aspect of the company's 1996 performance.

The passage indicates that the company leases various types of properties, including corporate offices, warehouses, and numerous diagnostic imaging facilities across multiple states. The lease terms are described as varying \"in length from month to month to 15 years with renewal options upon prior written notice, from 1 year to 15 years depending upon the agreed upon terms with the local landlord.\" Additionally, it states that \"Rents under our facility lease amounts generally increase from 1% to 6% on an annual basis.\" Importantly, the passage explicitly mentions, \"We do not have options to purchase the facilities we rent.\" This diverse range of lease terms, coupled with the lack of purchase options, makes D the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage clearly states they do not have options to purchase the facilities they rent.\n\nOption B is inaccurate because while some leases are short-term (month to month), others extend up to 15 years, and there's no indication that the majority are expiring within 2 years.\n\nOption C is wrong because the lease terms and rent increases are described as varying, not standardized."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "860451_2001.txt", "docs_id": "860451", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 8.
