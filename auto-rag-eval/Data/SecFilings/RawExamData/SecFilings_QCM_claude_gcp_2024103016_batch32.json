Additionally, it mentions that \"In January of 2010, the Bank opened its eleventh branch in Bloomingburg in a building it purchased in 2009.\" This means that by the end of 2009, the Bank owned 7 branch buildings (6 + 1 in Bloomingburg).\n\nFor the total number of branches, the passage initially states that \"the Bank has ten branch locations.\" It then mentions the eleventh branch in Bloomingburg that was purchased in 2009 (though opened in 2010).
