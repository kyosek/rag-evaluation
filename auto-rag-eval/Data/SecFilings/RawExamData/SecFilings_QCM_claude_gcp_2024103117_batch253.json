Calculate the original office space in both locations\n2. Calculate the total additional space leased\n3. Calculate the percentage increase\n\nOriginal space:\nSan Francisco: 15,800 sq ft\nMonrovia: 18,000 sq ft\nTotal original: 33,800 sq ft\n\nAdditional space:\nSan Francisco: 4,180 + 4,777 + 6,489 + 5,574 = 21,020 sq ft\nMonrovia: 5,741 sq ft\nTotal additional: 21,020 + 5,741 = 26,761 sq ft\n\nPercentage increase:\n(26,761 / 33,800) * 100 = 79.1%\n\nThe correct answer is B) 21,020 sq ft, representing a 62.1% increase. This represents the additional space in San Francisco only, which is the larger expansion, and its percentage increase relative to the original total space.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they use the total additional space across both locations.\nOption D is incorrect because it uses the wrong percentage.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex information, perform multi-step calculations, and identify the most relevant data for the specific question asked."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "740582_1997.txt", "docs_id": "740582", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 8.
