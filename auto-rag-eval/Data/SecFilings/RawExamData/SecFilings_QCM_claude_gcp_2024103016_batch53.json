The documentation clearly states that SecFilings leases all of their real properties, including office facilities, distribution centers, and retail locations. They have operations spread across multiple states, with office facilities in Colorado, Kentucky, Virginia, and Minnesota, distribution centers in California and Kentucky, and retail locations in 32 states. This demonstrates a diverse geographic spread and a consistent lease-based real estate strategy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases all properties, not just retail locations. Option B is misleading because while they do have a large distribution center in California, their largest one is actually in Franklin, Kentucky (250,000 sq ft). Option C is incorrect on two counts: the retail operations are in 32 states, which is not a small number, and the average store size ranges from 10,000 to 64,000 sq ft, not averaging 37,000 sq ft."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1547638_2013.htm", "docs_id": "1547638", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nOur real property falls into two categories:\n1.\nparcels that we own in fee title; and\n2. parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations.\nPortions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands.

First, the company recorded $12.5 million of estimated legal costs related to ongoing litigation matters in the second quarter of 2008. Second, they reversed $3.0 million of tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2009. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it mixes up the timing and amounts of the legal cost adjustments. Option C, while partially correct about the legal costs, omits the tax valuation allowance reversal in 2009. Option D is incorrect because it confuses the tax valuation allowance reversal with legal costs and attributes it to the wrong year."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "946673_2020.htm", "docs_id": "946673", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2 - Properties\nBanner Corporation maintains its administrative offices and main branch office, which is owned by us, in Walla Walla, Washington.

The passage explicitly states, \"The Company considers its facilities to be in excess of its requirements, and efforts are underway to lease or sell excess facilities.\" This indicates that the company has more space than it needs and is trying to optimize its real estate usage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company owns 600 acres of unoccupied land adjacent to its Huntsville facilities, suggesting ample room for expansion if needed.\n\nOption B, while the company does own 90,000 square feet in the UK, the passage doesn't provide enough information to conclude this represents its strongest international presence.\n\nOption C contradicts the information given, as the company is described as having excess capacity, not inadequate facilities."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "25232_2004.htm", "docs_id": "25232", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 8.
