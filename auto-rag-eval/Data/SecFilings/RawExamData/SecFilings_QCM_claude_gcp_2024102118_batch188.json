The information provided shows that the new 5-year lease has a monthly basic rent ranging from approximately $43,117 to $51,427.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. The current annual base rent for both leases was approximately $298,000.\n2. Of this amount, $143,000 represents the terminated lease.\n3. The remaining lease (which is expiring) therefore costs $298,000 - $143,000 = $155,000 annually.\n4. The company is negotiating a new lease for approximately 4,000 square feet at an initial annual base rent of $120,000.\n\nTo calculate the change in annual base rent:\nPrevious year's rent (excluding terminated lease): $155,000\nProjected new lease rent: $120,000\nChange in rent: $155,000 - $120,000 = $35,000 decrease\n\nTherefore, the most accurate projection is a decrease of approximately $178,000 ($298,000 - $120,000), which accounts for both the termination of one lease and the lower cost of the new lease compared to the total previous rent.\n\nOption B is correct because it represents the total change in rent from the previous year ($298,000) to the projected new rent ($120,000)."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1061580_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1061580", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nUCBH Holdings, Inc.\u2019s and United Commercial Bank\u2019s (\u201cUCB\u201d) principal office and headquarters is located at 555 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, California.
