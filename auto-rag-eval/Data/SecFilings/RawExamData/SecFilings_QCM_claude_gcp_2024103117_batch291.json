In September 2003, Ironstone repurchased all of these shares. Such repurchased shares are currently being held as treasury stock.

The document states that the company is \"reviewing options and new business opportunities\" but provides no concrete plans. It also explicitly mentions that \"There can be no assurance that the Company will acquire businesses, form additional alliances, or expand its existing services,\" and warns that failure to expand services \"may have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\" This uncertainty in the company's future direction and potential for growth represents the most fundamental risk to its business prospects.\n\nOption A is a concern but not necessarily the most significant risk, as diversification could mitigate this.
