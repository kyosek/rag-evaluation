If the company exercises its right to renew the headquarters lease for an additional five years, and assuming all other leases remain unchanged, in which year will the company have the highest number of leases expiring?\n\nA) 2006\nB) 2007\nC) 2011\nD) 2012\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires careful analysis of the given information and some assumptions. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. The 1,038 store leases have varying expiration dates, which are not specified in detail.\n2. The headquarters lease in Grapevine, Texas, originally expires on January 31, 2006, but can be renewed for 5 more years, potentially extending to 2011.\n3. The Minneapolis office lease expires in February 2007.\n\nIf the company renews the headquarters lease, it will expire in 2011. This is later than both the original 2006 expiration and the Minneapolis office's 2007 expiration. \n\nWhile we don't have specific data on the store lease expirations, it's reasonable to assume that a significant number of the 1,038 store leases would be expiring around the 10-year mark (given the typical 3-10 year initial terms mentioned). The year 2011 would be about 9 years from the reference date of February 2, 2002, falling within this range.\n\nTherefore, 2011 is likely to have the highest number of lease expirations, including the renewed headquarters lease and potentially many store leases reaching the end of their terms."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1463258_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1463258", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "ITEM 2.\nProperties\nThe following table lists each of our owned production facilities and their location, use, and nameplate production capacity.

The mortgage is amortized over 30 years but due in 7 years.

This structure is characteristic of a balloon mortgage. In a balloon mortgage, payments are typically calculated as if the loan would be paid off over a longer term (in this case, 30 years), but the entire remaining balance becomes due at an earlier date (here, after 7 years).\n\nThe main risk associated with this type of loan is refinancing risk. When the balloon payment comes due after 7 years, the company will need to either pay off the remaining balance in full or, more likely, refinance the loan. If economic conditions, interest rates, or the company's financial situation have changed unfavorably during those 7 years, refinancing might be difficult or more expensive, posing a significant financial risk to the company.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would not be due in 7 years. Option C is incorrect because while an adjustable-rate mortgage does carry interest rate risk, the described loan doesn't mention rate adjustments.
