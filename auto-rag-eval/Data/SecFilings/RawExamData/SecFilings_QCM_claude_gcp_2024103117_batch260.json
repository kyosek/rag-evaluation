The company owns service vehicles and generally owns the towers for their equipment. However, they lease space for business offices and use utility poles under rental agreements with local utilities. The cable plant is attached to these poles or buried underground. Additionally, headend and tower locations are on owned or leased land. This combination of owned and leased or shared assets best fits the description in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that the company leases some assets, like office spaces.\n\nOption B is inaccurate because while the company does lease some assets, it also owns others, such as service vehicles and often the towers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while underground ducts and trenches are mentioned, they are not described as the primary method of distribution.

Subtracting the 3 leased offices (Hubbard, Niles Park Plaza, and Hudson) from the total 13 offices leaves 10 owned offices. The two financial service centers are separate from the 13 main offices. Therefore, the bank owns 10 of its main offices, leases 3 main offices, and leases 2 additional financial service centers.
