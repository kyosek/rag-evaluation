The documentation states that the Registrant initially acquired equity interests in ten local limited partnerships. Five of these were sold through trustee's sales (foreclosures). The assets of three additional properties have been sold. However, one of these (Alms Hill Partnership) still exists with a note receivable for the sales proceeds.

Option B is incorrect as it overstates the number of remaining investments and doesn't account for the three sold properties that weren't foreclosed.

According to the documentation, the European operations are conducted primarily in Cambridge, England, where the company leases approximately 4,000 square feet \"pursuant to a lease that expires in April 2007.\" This is the earliest expiring lease mentioned in the document, and it directly relates to the European operations in question. Therefore, if the company is planning to relocate its European operations, it would need to prioritize this move and complete it by April 2007 when the current lease expires.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Maryland engineering lease expiration in March 2008 is unrelated to the European operations.\nAnswer B is incorrect because the principal executive office lease expiration in March 2010 is for the Westport, Connecticut location, not the European operations.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Artera Turbo product development lease expiration in March 2009 is for the Middlebury, Connecticut location, not the European operations.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease information, identify relevant data, and make logical conclusions about business operations and timing based on the provided information."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1272928_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1272928", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 2.
