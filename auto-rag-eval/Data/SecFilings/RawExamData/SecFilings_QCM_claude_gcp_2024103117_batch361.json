The document states the quarry has approximately 33 million tons of remaining reserves, assuming a 20% loss factor for unusable material.\n\n2. We need to calculate the usable reserves:\n   33 million tons * 0.8 (accounting for 20% loss) = 26.4 million tons of usable reserves\n\n3. The annual production rate is given as 1.1 million tons in 2004.\n\n4. To find the number of years the reserves will last:\n   26.4 million tons / 1.1 million tons per year \u2248 24 years\n\n5. However, the question asks for the number of years assuming a constant production rate AND accounting for the 20% loss factor.\n\n6. To account for this, we need to divide the total reserves (33 million tons) by the annual production plus the 20% loss:\n   33 million tons / (1.1 million tons * 1.2) \u2248 30 years\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 30 years.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret the given information, perform multi-step calculations, and account for all factors mentioned in both the passage and the question."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "859163_2004.htm", "docs_id": "859163", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nWe conduct manufacturing operations throughout the world.

The documentation states that the Investment Partnership acquired interests in 31 Operating Partnerships. Two of these (Springchase Apartments and Trinidad Apartments) lost their properties in a December 1997 foreclosure sale and were subsequently liquidated. Additionally, one property was sold in November 2001. This leaves 28 properties that were still owned and occupied as of December 31, 2001, plus the one sold property (totaling 29) that had occupants for most of the year until its sale. \n\nOption A is incorrect because not all 31 partnerships were operational at the end of 2001. \nOption B is close but incorrectly states that 28 were still owned and occupied at year-end, when it should be 29 that had occupants during the year (including the one sold in November).\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't account for the foreclosed and sold properties."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "882742_1996.txt", "docs_id": "882742", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.
