Twenty-foot container: ~1,360 cubic feet\n2. Forty-foot container: ~2,720 cubic feet\n3. Forty-foot high-cube: ~3,040 cubic feet\n\nOption C provides:\n150 x 3,040 + 100 x 2,720 = 456,000 + 272,000 = 728,000 cubic feet\n\nThis exceeds the required 200,000 cubic feet. More importantly, it uses forty-foot high-cube and forty-foot containers, which have the highest utilization rates (89% for dry cargo, which includes both types). This combination maximizes the use of high-demand containers while meeting the space requirement.\n\nOptions A and D rely heavily on twenty-foot containers, which have lower utilization rates. Option B doesn't provide enough space (only about 668,000 cubic feet). Therefore, C is the most likely choice to meet the requirement while maximizing utilization rates."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1642453_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1642453", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.

To calculate the percentage of leased properties:\n78 / 105 = 0.7429, or 74.3%\n\nThis high percentage of leased properties (74.3%) suggests that Daseke prefers a leasing strategy for most of its locations. This approach typically allows for greater flexibility in adapting to market changes and reduces the need for large capital investments in real estate. It also allows the company to allocate more resources to its core business operations rather than tying up capital in property ownership.\n\nThe other options are either incorrect calculations or misinterpretations of what this percentage might imply about the company's strategy.
