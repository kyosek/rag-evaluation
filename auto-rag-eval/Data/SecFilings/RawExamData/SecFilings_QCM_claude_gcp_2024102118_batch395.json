According to the documentation, Covance owns a substantial facility in Geneva, Switzerland and leases a substantial facility in Indianapolis, Indiana for its central laboratory services. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Covance does own facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and Vienna, Virginia for early development services, it owns (not leases) the facility in Geneva for central laboratory services.\n\nOption B is partially correct about leasing facilities for clinical development services, but it's wrong about owning facilities for bioanalytical services. The document states that Covance leases facilities for bioanalytical services in Indianapolis and Chantilly.\n\nOption D is entirely incorrect. Covance owns (not leases) facilities for early development services in Muenster, Germany, and leases (not owns) facilities for clinical development services in Horsham, UK.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and accurately interpret complex information about a company's property arrangements across different locations and service areas."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1505732_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1505732", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.
