The Company terminated the Eden Prairie lease effective March 31, 1998.\nEffective in the first quarter of 1998, the Company's principal executive and administrative offices are located in Seattle, Washington. Starting in January 1998, the Company began subleasing approximately 1,500 square feet of office space in Seattle, Washington on a month-to-month basis. The Company has entered into a lease for approximately 7,000 square feet of space and anticipates moving into the new building in May 1998. The lease expires approximately 62 months from the move in date.\nEffective March, 1998, the Company's sales personnel are located in an office building in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The lease is for approximately 1,000 square feet and expires in September 1998.\nThe Company also leases space in the following locations: (1) 4,124 square feet in an office building in Carlsbad, California ending in approximately June 1999 and (2) 790 square feet in an office building in Carlsbad, California ending in May 1998. The Company does not currently intend to renew either of these leases.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In 1998, the company underwent significant changes in its office locations. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the company's office situation by the end of 1998, assuming all plans mentioned were executed?\n\nA) The company's principal executive offices were located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, occupying approximately 40,000 square feet.\n\nB) The company maintained offices in Seattle, Edina, and two locations in Carlsbad, with a total leased space of approximately 13,414 square feet.\n\nC) The company's main offices were in Seattle, occupying 7,000 square feet, with additional space in Edina and one location in Carlsbad, totaling approximately 12,124 square feet.\n\nD) The company had offices in Seattle and Edina, with a combined leased space of approximately 8,000 square feet.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires careful analysis of the provided information and attention to timing. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The Eden Prairie office was terminated on March 31, 1998, eliminating option A.\n\n2. The company moved its principal offices to Seattle, initially subleasing 1,500 sq ft, but planned to move into a 7,000 sq ft space in May 1998.\n\n3. A 1,000 sq ft office in Edina, Minnesota was leased until September 1998.\n\n4. Of the two Carlsbad offices, one lease (790 sq ft) ended in May 1998, while the other (4,124 sq ft) continued until June 1999.\n\n5. The company stated it did not intend to renew either Carlsbad lease, but the larger one would still be active at the end of 1998.\n\nTherefore, by the end of 1998, the company would have:\n- 7,000 sq ft in Seattle\n- 1,000 sq ft in Edina (assuming they extended or found a new space after September)\n- 4,124 sq ft in Carlsbad\n\nThis totals 12,124 sq ft, matching option C. Option B is incorrect because it includes both Carlsbad locations and uses the initial Seattle sublease size. Option D underestimates the total space by excluding the Carlsbad office that was still active."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "701719_2009.htm", "docs_id": "701719", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2.

Furthermore, the company expresses confidence in its ability to find replacement facilities if needed, demonstrating flexibility in their approach to real estate management.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company owns its new headquarters, it leases most other facilities.
