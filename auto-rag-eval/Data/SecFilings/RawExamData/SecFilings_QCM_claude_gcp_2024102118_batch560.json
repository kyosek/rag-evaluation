The information provided states that the facilities generally operate at about 60% of capacity, with each division averaging slightly less than two shifts operating at full capacity for a five-day work week.

States starting with letters A through M include: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi.\n4. We need to count only Company-owned facilities in these states.\n5. The question doesn't provide the exact distribution of facilities per state, so we must assume the Company-owned properties are evenly distributed across all 13 states.\n6. 87 Company-owned facilities divided by 13 states gives an average of 6.69 facilities per state.\n7. There are 7 states starting with letters A through M.\n8. 6.69 facilities per state * 7 states = 46.83 facilities.\n9.
