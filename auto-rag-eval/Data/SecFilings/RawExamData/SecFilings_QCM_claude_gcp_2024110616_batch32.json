The correct answer, B, is supported by several key points:\n\n1. The data shows Expeditors has significantly more leased properties (182) than owned properties (51), especially in foreign markets (140 leased vs. 23 owned).\n2. This high number of leased foreign facilities suggests a strategy of rapid market entry and expansion, as leasing allows for quicker setup and easier exit if needed.\n3. However, the reliance on leased properties, particularly internationally, exposes the company to potential risks from lease market fluctuations and currency exchange rate changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the data shows a low ratio of owned to leased properties, not a high one. Option C is inaccurate because the domestic approach isn't particularly balanced (28 owned vs. 42 leased), and it doesn't reflect the global picture. Option D is wrong because the owned properties are not concentrated in the U.S. (28 domestic vs. 23 foreign owned), and the large number of foreign leased properties contradicts a risk-averse approach to international expansion.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (property ownership, leasing strategies, international business risks) and apply them to a complex business scenario, targeting higher-level cognitive skills in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "97052_1998.txt", "docs_id": "97052", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

The correct answer (B) is based on the following analysis:\n\n1. The documentation states that the approximate lease expenditure for Suite 1200 is $24,255 annually for 2014, 2015, and 2016, \"including sales tax.\"\n2. However, the lease description for the principal executive offices (presumably including Suite 1200) mentions that the rent is \"all-inclusive and includes electricity during normal business hours, heat, air-conditioning, and water.\"\n3. Given that utilities are included and the $24,255 figure only accounts for base rent plus sales tax, the total annual cost is likely to be significantly higher when factoring in these additional services.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the lease is described as \"long-term non-cancellable,\" which doesn't suggest more flexibility than typical.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the company has entered into long-term leases (39 months) and is anticipating executing a new lease for Suite 2250, indicating a preference for longer-term commitments.\n\nOption D is misleading because while the company did expand its space in 2013, there's no clear indication of anticipated significant growth in the near future based on the current lease information.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, consider real-world implications (like total cost of leasing), and apply critical thinking to a business scenario."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "46709_1997.txt", "docs_id": "46709", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 8.

The correct answer, B, is based on several key points:\n\n1. The document states that the \"major portion\" of Berkshire's distribution mains are \"constructed of coated steel, plastic or cast iron,\" indicating these are preferred materials.\n\n2. It mentions that \"gas mains are primarily located under public highways and streets,\" suggesting this is the most common and likely preferred location for new mains.\n\n3.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. Prepayments: The Trust experienced 4,999 prepayments totaling $130,440,187.76 out of the original $699,376,130.00. This represents a significant portion (about 18.7%) of the original receivables being paid off early, indicating strong borrower financial health.\n\n2.

The correct answer, C, is the most beneficial strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. \"Triple net\" leases, as mentioned in the documentation, require the tenant (Buffalo Wild Wings) to pay for rent, taxes, maintenance, and insurance. This arrangement typically results in lower base rent and transfers most property-related expenses to the tenant, which is advantageous for the property owner.\n\n2. The \"exclusive use\" provisions prohibit landlords from leasing space to competing restaurants. This protects Buffalo Wild Wings' business interests and makes the property more valuable to them, potentially leading to longer tenancy and more stable income for the property owner.\n\n3. This option integrates multiple concepts from the documentation and requires understanding of real estate investment principles.\n\nOption A is less ideal because while short-term leases offer flexibility, they also introduce uncertainty and potential turnover costs.

This can be deduced from several key points:\n\n1. PMC-Sierra leases properties in 34 locations worldwide, indicating a broad global presence rather than a centralized approach.\n\n2. They operate fourteen additional research and development centers spread across multiple countries (Canada, U.S., India, Israel, Germany, and China), showing a strategy of distributed R&D rather than centralizing all activities in one location.\n\n3.

The company primarily leases office spaces of varying sizes (from approximately 35,000 sq ft for headquarters to smaller spaces) across multiple locations in the United States. This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: Leasing allows the company to adjust its real estate portfolio more easily as needs change, which is crucial for a rapidly growing tech company.\n\n2. Geographic diversity: The company has offices spread across various states, allowing it to tap into different talent pools and serve clients in multiple regions.\n\n3.

The correct answer (C) aligns most closely with EastGroup's current strategy and portfolio composition for several reasons:\n\n1. Geographic focus: The documentation states that EastGroup's properties are \"located primarily in the Sunbelt states of Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.\"\n\n2. Property type focus: EastGroup's primary focus is \"the ownership of business distribution space (currently 75% of the total portfolio).\"\n\n3. Development strategy: The company has \"developed over 24% of its total portfolio,\" indicating a significant focus on property development.\n\n4. Property characteristics: The documentation describes business distribution space properties as \"typically multi-tenant buildings with a building depth of 200 feet or less, clear height of 20-24 feet, office finish of 10-25% and truck courts with a depth of 100-120 feet.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests expanding into residential properties and the Midwest, neither of which align with EastGroup's current focus on industrial properties in Sunbelt states.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while EastGroup does have some bulk distribution space (20% of the portfolio), it's not their primary focus, and the question specifies \"large-scale\" centers, which doesn't align with their typical property characteristics.\n\nOption D is incorrect because high-rise office buildings in financial districts are completely outside of EastGroup's current portfolio and strategy, which focuses on industrial properties.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the company's current strategy and apply that understanding to a potential future business decision, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation."}, "65": {"documentation": {"source": "106926_1997.txt", "docs_id": "106926", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2: PROPERTIES\nThe Company owns no real estate in its own name.

The correct answer, C, is supported by several key points:\n\n1. Ownership vs. Leasing: The document states that the bank owns approximately 70% of its branch facilities, with the remainder being leased. This indicates a balanced approach rather than a preference for leasing (ruling out option A) or a focus on generating leasing revenue (ruling out option D).\n\n2.

Given Biomerica's current leasing arrangements, which of the following scenarios would most likely present the greatest financial risk to the company in the next 5 years?\n\nA) Exercising the option to extend the Irvine headquarters lease for another 60-month period after August 2021\nB) Terminating the lease for the manufacturing space in Mexico before the 10-year term is complete\nC) Failing to secure a long-term lease for the small office in Lindau, Germany\nD) Continuing the month-to-month lease for the smaller manufacturing unit in Mexico\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the company's current lease commitments and their potential impact on future operations. Option B presents the greatest financial risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Long-term commitment: The Mexican subsidiary entered a 10-year lease for a significant manufacturing space (8,100 sq ft). Terminating this lease early would likely involve substantial penalties or buyout costs.\n\n2. Strategic importance: Manufacturing space is crucial for a biotech company's operations. Losing this space could disrupt production and affect the company's ability to meet demand.\n\n3. Financial implications: The base rent for this space ($2,926/month) represents a significant ongoing commitment. Early termination would mean losing the benefit of this locked-in rate over the full 10-year term.\n\n4. Growth potential: The size of this space suggests it's intended to support long-term growth. Terminating early could hinder expansion plans.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Option A involves a known quantity (the current headquarters lease) and the company has already successfully extended this lease once, suggesting less risk.\n- Option C, while potentially disruptive, involves a smaller office space that likely has less impact on core operations.\n- Option D is a month-to-month arrangement, offering flexibility with minimal long-term risk.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze lease terms, understand their strategic importance, and evaluate potential risks in a real-world business scenario."}, "74": {"documentation": {"source": "1166789_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1166789", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nWe maintain our corporate headquarters in Providence under an operating lease that expires on December 31, 2009.\nEach of our stations has facilities consisting of offices, studios, sales offices and tower and transmitter sites.

The correct answer, D, is the most beneficial strategy because:\n\n1. Long-term leases (20-30 years) align with the company's current practice, as mentioned in the documentation: \"Generally, store leases have primary terms ranging from 20 to 30 years.\"\n\n2. Multiple renewal options (5-20 years) are included, providing flexibility for future growth, as stated: \"and include renewal options ranging from 5 to 20 years.\"\n\n3. Variable rent components are maintained, as per the current model: \"Store leases generally require the Company to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location.\" This allows the company to share risk with landlords during economic fluctuations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because eliminating percentage-based rent removes the benefit of sharing risk with landlords during slower sales periods. Option B is flawed because purchasing properties would increase upfront costs and reduce flexibility. Additionally, the documentation states that even owned locations still have some common area maintenance responsibilities. Option C is incorrect because shorter lease terms without renewal options would reduce long-term stability and potentially increase costs due to more frequent negotiations and possible relocations.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the candidate to integrate multiple aspects of lease structure and apply them to a real-world scenario of business expansion and cost optimization."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "718924_2015.htm", "docs_id": "718924", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 1.

The correct answer, D, represents the most insightful conclusion that can be drawn from the given information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document shows annual renewals, which might actually be beneficial for a growing company that may need flexibility.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on a common misconception. While lease deposits are mentioned ($1,592), they are not significantly high compared to the annual payments, and thus unlikely to cause major cash flow issues.\n\nOption C is incorrect and represents a misinterpretation of the data.
