Lauderdale office likely does not include operating expenses. A reasonable estimate for operating expenses might be about 50% of the base rent, which would add approximately $3,000 to the Ft.

BUSINESS.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements contain projections of our future results of operations or our financial position or state other forward-looking information. In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" and \"would\" or similar words. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that might cause these differences are described under Item 1A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the nature and purpose of forward-looking statements in an Annual Report on Form 10-K, according to the provided excerpt?\n\nA) Forward-looking statements are guaranteed predictions of a company's future performance and should be relied upon by investors for making financial decisions.\n\nB) Forward-looking statements are historical facts that provide an accurate representation of a company's past results and current financial position.\n\nC) Forward-looking statements are projections of future results or financial positions that involve known and unknown risks, and should not be solely relied upon due to potential material differences in actual outcomes.\n\nD) Forward-looking statements are legally binding commitments that a company must fulfill, as outlined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The excerpt clearly states that forward-looking statements \"contain projections of our future results of operations or our financial position or state other forward-looking information.\" It also warns that these statements involve \"known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors\" that may cause actual results to \"differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the excerpt explicitly states that one \"should not rely on forward-looking statements\" due to associated risks and uncertainties.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the passage clearly distinguishes forward-looking statements from historical facts, stating that they \"are not historical facts.\"\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because forward-looking statements are not described as legally binding commitments.

The total number of stores leased is the sum of U.S. stores (213) and Canadian stores (200), which equals 413. The passage states that \"the majority of the leases have an original term of five years plus two optional five-year renewal options.\" This means the maximum potential lease term is 5 years (original term) + 5 years (first renewal) + 5 years (second renewal) = 15 years total.

The Ensenada, Mexico facility is owned, but the land is held in a 30-year trust expiring in 2019. By 2020, this will need to be addressed.\n3.

It's also not serving other major functions like corporate headquarters, making it a more focused site for chemical production expansion.\n\nC) Augusta, GA, while having a large land area (46 acres), is not a viable option because the plant was closed in 2001.
