The documentation states that \"2008 amounts include the results of Trane since the acquisition date (June 5, 2008 through December 31, 2008).\" This means that the 2008 financial data is not directly comparable to 2007 and 2009 due to the inclusion of Trane's results for part of the year.

The Company did not, however, develop any surgery centers.\nIn April, 1984, the Company commenced efforts to develop nursing homes in an effort to diversify its efforts. The Company built and sold to an unrelated purchaser a 187-bed skilled nursing home in Vista, California. The Company presently owns and operates a 156-bed skilled nursing home in Colton, California. The Company does not at this time have any plans to develop other nursing homes.\nThe Company has invested funds in nursing homes, in residential real estate developments and in the oil business.\nAll of the industries in which the Company has invested are extremely competitive in all phases. Many of its competitors, both public and private, possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially greater than those which are currently available to the Company.\nItem 2."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: InterWest Medical Corporation has diversified its business activities since its incorporation. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the company's current operational focus and history?\n\nA) The company primarily operates surgery centers and is expanding its presence in the medical services sector.\nB) The company has successfully developed multiple nursing homes across different states and continues to focus on this area.\nC) The company owns and operates a single skilled nursing home while having past involvement in various other industries.\nD) The company is primarily focused on residential real estate development and oil business investments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation states that InterWest Medical Corporation currently owns and operates a 156-bed skilled nursing home in Colton, California. While the company was originally incorporated to develop surgery centers, it did not actually develop any. The company built and sold one nursing home in Vista, California, but does not have plans to develop more. Additionally, the document mentions that the company has invested in nursing homes, residential real estate developments, and the oil business, indicating past involvement in various industries. However, the current operational focus appears to be on the single skilled nursing home they own and operate in Colton.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company never developed any surgery centers. Option B is incorrect as the company only built and sold one nursing home besides the one they currently operate, and has no plans for further development. Option D is incorrect because while the company has invested in real estate and oil, these are not described as the primary focus of their current operations."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "8868_2000.txt", "docs_id": "8868", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

The Company also leases approximately 84,000, 34,000, 30,900, 15,300, and 11,300 square feet of office space in Reston, Virginia, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Annapolis Junction, Maryland, Lowell, Massachusetts, and Seabrook, Maryland, respectively, which space is used primarily for the performance of study, system engineering and hardware contracts. The Reston facility leases expire in 1997 through 2001. The Colorado Springs, Annapolis Junction, Lowell, and Seabrook leases expire in 1999, 2003, 2001, and 1997, respectively.

Which of the following statements would be the most critical consideration for the acquiring company regarding the target's real estate situation?\n\nA) The company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, comprises approximately 172,000 square feet of leased space.\n\nB) The leases for the Reston, Virginia facility will expire between 1997 and 2001.\n\nC) The company has additional leased offices in Colorado Springs, Annapolis Junction, Lowell, and Seabrook.\n\nD) The Sunnyvale facility leases will expire in the year 2000, potentially requiring immediate action or renegotiation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While all options provide factual information from the SEC filing, option D represents the most critical consideration for an acquiring company. The impending expiration of the headquarters' lease in Sunnyvale (172,000 square feet) in the year 2000 is the most pressing issue. This situation could require immediate attention, potentially involving complex negotiations, relocation plans, or significant capital expenditure. The other options, while informative, do not present the same level of urgency or potential impact on the company's operations. The headquarters houses the principal engineering and manufacturing facilities, making it crucial to the company's core functions. An acquiring company would need to factor this imminent lease expiration into their acquisition strategy and post-acquisition planning."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "915290_2002.htm", "docs_id": "915290", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "Item 2.
