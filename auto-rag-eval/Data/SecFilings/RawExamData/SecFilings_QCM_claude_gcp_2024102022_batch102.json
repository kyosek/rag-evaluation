The rental revenue adjustment of $43,000 is likely already accounted for in the company's regular income statement, so we shouldn't double-count it here.\n\nTherefore, the correct total impact on income is:\n$506,000 (gain from sale) + $106,000 (deferred revenue recognition) = $612,000\n\nThe closest option to this amount is $394,000 gain (option B).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read financial information, understand various components of a transaction, and accurately calculate its overall impact while avoiding double-counting."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "350832_1995.txt", "docs_id": "350832", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "Item 2.

Based on the given information, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's property leases?\n\nA) The company will need to renew or relocate its largest office space first, as the Costa Mesa lease expires before all others.\nB) The company has the most flexibility with its Michigan office, as it operates on a month-to-month lease.\nC) The Texas office in Irving provides the most long-term stability, as its lease extends furthest into the future.\nD) The Boston office lease will be the last to expire, giving the company the most time to plan for that location.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct because the Costa Mesa office, which is the largest at approximately 39,000 square feet and houses the principal executive offices, has a lease expiring in September 2009. This is the earliest expiration date mentioned for any of the current leases.\n\nB) is incorrect because the document states that the Michigan office was previously leased on a month-to-month basis but has been replaced by the new Texas office in Irving.\n\nC) is incorrect because while the Irving, Texas office lease does extend to January 2010, the Boston office lease actually extends further, to June 2010.\n\nD) is incorrect because the Boston office lease, expiring in June 2010, is not the last to expire.
