The Company anticipates that in most cases retail space for new stores opened or acquired will be leased.

The passage indicates that Little Switzerland employs a balanced approach of strategic ownership and flexible leasing to optimize its capital allocation and location selection. This is evidenced by:\n\n1. The company owns its facility in Philipsburg, St. Maarten, and the building housing its headquarters and warehouse on St. Thomas, showing strategic ownership of key properties.\n\n2.

It specifically mentions that two of these buildings are leased from unaffiliated third-party landlords, and one is owned. Furthermore, it states that the unaffiliated third-party landlords bought these three Evansville buildings from the Company and its subsidiaries in December 2006.

The original lease (11,856 sq ft) started in 2006, so by 2010 it would be past its second year. Its monthly rent would have increased by 3% at least once, but we don't have enough information to calculate it precisely.\n\n2. For the lease that started on November 1, 2008 (11,834 sq ft):\n   First year: $5.50 per sq ft annually\n   Second year: $5.50 * 1.03 = $5.665 per sq ft\n   Third year: $5.665 * 1.03 = $5.83495 per sq ft\n\n   Monthly rent in third year: (11,834 * $5.83495) / 12 = $5,754.06\n\n3. Adding this to the original lease's monthly rent of $8,151 (which would be higher due to annual increases):\n   $8,151 + $5,754.06 = $13,905.06\n\nThe closest option to this calculated amount is $13,961 per month.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease terms, perform calculations with percentage increases, and combine information from multiple leases."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "100331_2004.htm", "docs_id": "100331", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
