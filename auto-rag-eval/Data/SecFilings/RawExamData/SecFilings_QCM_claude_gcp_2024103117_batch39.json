The company has restructured and recorded a charge of $180,000 to reflect excess capacity at the Berkeley facility, which it intends to vacate and sublease. This indicates a one-time expense of $180,000. Additionally, if the company successfully subleases the excess space, it may generate some income to offset its lease expenses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the new lease payments are $184,000 per year, this is not an immediate reduction from previous years' expenses, which were higher.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the new lease actually covers less space (28,000 square feet) compared to the previous lease, and the company is actively trying to reduce its space usage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the company has already exercised its option to terminate the lease that was due to expire in 1999, and has entered into a new, shorter lease.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to interpret financial information related to leases and restructuring, and to understand the short-term financial implications of corporate restructuring decisions."}}
