Let's break down the correct answer and why the others are incorrect:\n\nA) Correct. The future rental commitments are $31.6 million, while the investment in premises and equipment is $25.3 million. The difference is $6.3 million, which is indeed 24.9% of $25.3 million. This indicates a slight preference for leasing over ownership.\n\nB) Incorrect. While the ratio of 5 owned to 18 leased branches is correct, this alone doesn't provide enough information to conclude about strategic balance or operational flexibility.\n\nC) Incorrect. The investment in premises and equipment ($25.3 million) is actually 80.1% of the future rental commitments ($31.6 million), not the other way around.\n\nD) Incorrect. While there are indeed 23 total branch locations (5 owned + 18 leased), the $31.6 million in future rental commitments is not necessarily evenly distributed among the leased branches.
