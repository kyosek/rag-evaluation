One operation \"will be relocated to a new and larger leased facility during fiscal 2002.\"\n\nThese actions indicate a strategic approach to facility management, aiming to improve efficiency and optimize operations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the document explicitly states that the Company \"does not believe that it will have difficulty renewing such leases or finding alternative sites.\"\n\nAnswer B is false because the text mentions that \"The Company's facilities generally are capable of being utilized at higher capacities, if necessary,\" indicating that they are not operating at maximum capacity.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the document clearly mentions leased facilities and discusses lease renewals, showing that the Company does engage in leasing arrangements."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "315849_2008.txt", "docs_id": "315849", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.

The document states that Pathmark has 135 supermarkets in total, with 18 owned and 117 leased. It also mentions that 29 leases expire during the current and next four calendar years, and Pathmark has options to renew all of them. Additionally, the document indicates that Pathmark will consider entering into sale/leaseback or mortgage transactions for owned properties if financially advantageous. This combination of leasing, ownership, renewal options, and openness to sale/leaseback arrangements demonstrates a flexible and strategic approach to property management.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that all supermarkets are owned, which contradicts the information provided. Option B is incorrect because it reverses the numbers of owned and leased properties and suggests a plan to convert all leased properties to owned status, which is not mentioned in the document.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential investment?\n\nA) The property is likely to have at least 100,000 square feet of total space, including outdoor areas.\nB) If the current lease expires in 2000, the investor can be certain the property will be vacant after that date.\nC) The property is one of 14 stores owned by Hechinger, making it a rare opportunity to acquire a company-owned location.\nD) The investor should anticipate possible long-term tenancy due to renewal clauses, even if the current lease is nearing expiration.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because Hechinger stores average about 70,000 square feet under roof and 22,000 square feet of outdoor space, totaling 92,000 square feet, which is less than 100,000.\n\nB) is incorrect because the document states that \"Almost all leases contain renewal clauses or continue on a year-to-year basis after their respective expiration dates,\" meaning expiration doesn't guarantee vacancy.\n\nC) is incorrect because the document states \"The Company currently owns 14 stores and leases the remaining stores.\" Since Hechinger leases most of its stores, it's more likely that the property in question is leased, not owned.\n\nD) is correct because the document mentions that almost all leases contain renewal clauses or continue year-to-year after expiration. This suggests that even if a lease is nearing its expiration date, there's a high likelihood of continued tenancy through renewals or extensions."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1017916_1997.txt", "docs_id": "1017916", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.
