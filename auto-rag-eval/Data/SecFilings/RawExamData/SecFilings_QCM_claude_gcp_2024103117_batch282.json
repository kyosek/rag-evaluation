This would have ended in January 2016. However, the documentation states that in February 2010, they amended the lease and \"extended the lease term for one year through January 2017.\" This gives us the new expiration date of January 2017. \n\nRegarding the rent, the amendment in February 2010 reduced the annual rent to approximately $512,000 \"for the remaining term.\" Since this reduction applies to the entire remaining term, including the extension, the annual rent for the final year (2017) would still be approximately $512,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) January 2017; $512,000."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "857499_2000.txt", "docs_id": "857499", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2\nPROPERTIES\nThe main office of the Bank is located at 100 Slade's Ferry Avenue, Somerset, Massachusetts at the junctions of U.S. Routes 6, 138, and 103.
