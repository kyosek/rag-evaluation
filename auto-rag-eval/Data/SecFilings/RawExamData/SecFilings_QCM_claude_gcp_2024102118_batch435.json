It also mentions that if this agreement were not renewed or terminated, the company believes other suitable facilities could be obtained.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the company both owns and leases properties, and has storage agreements with commercial facilities.\n\nOption B is partly correct but ultimately incorrect. While the Matamoros facility does produce penta products, the Tuscaloosa location is used to formulate penta solutions, not produce MSMA products. The text states that MSMA products are also made at the Matamoros facility.\n\nOption D is incorrect on two counts.

Omaha, NE: $3,859 per month * 12 months = $46,308\n2. Huntington Beach, CA: $2,860 per month, but sublet for $2,700\n   Net cost: $160 per month * 12 months = $1,920\n3. Dallas, TX: $1,000 per month * 12 months = $12,000\n\nTotal annual cost: $46,308 + $1,920 + $12,000 = $60,228\n\nHowever, the question asks for the cost if all leases were maintained for the entire year without considering the actual termination dates. So, we need to calculate as if the Huntington Beach lease wasn't terminated in March:\n\nHuntington Beach, CA (full year): $2,860 * 12 = $34,320\n\nNew total: $46,308 + $34,320 + $12,000 = $92,628\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret the given information, perform accurate calculations, and consider hypothetical scenarios based on the provided data."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1135185_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1135185", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nAircraft\nOwned and leased aircraft at December 31, 2007 include the following:\nLease expirations for our operating leased aircraft included in the above table range from October 2010 to February 2025.
