They also lease properties in multiple states and have a $50 million revolving line of credit with Comerica Bank. What is the most likely reason for pledging their Iowa properties as collateral for this line of credit?\n\nA) To expand their campus operations into new states\nB) To finance the construction of additional buildings in Iowa\nC) To secure favorable interest rates on student loans\nD) To maintain financial flexibility for ongoing operations and potential future needs\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The university's decision to pledge their Iowa properties as collateral for a $50 million revolving line of credit with Comerica Bank is most likely aimed at maintaining financial flexibility for ongoing operations and potential future needs.\n\nA revolving line of credit is a flexible borrowing option that allows an organization to draw funds as needed up to a certain limit, repay, and then borrow again. This type of financial instrument is typically used to manage cash flow, fund short-term operational needs, or provide a safety net for unexpected expenses.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because expanding campus operations into new states would likely require a more substantial and long-term financing arrangement, not a revolving line of credit.\n\nAnswer B is plausible but less likely. While the line of credit could potentially be used for construction, the revolving nature of the credit suggests it's not intended for a specific large-scale project like new building construction.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because student loans are typically handled through separate financial mechanisms and would not require the university to pledge its properties as collateral.\n\nThe documentation states that the facilities are \"suitable and adequate for current requirements,\" which supports the idea that the line of credit is more likely for maintaining flexibility in operations rather than for specific expansion or construction projects."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1021561_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1021561", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur principal properties consist of the following:\nOffices\nWe have administrative offices at our corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah, and in various markets, including in Shanghai, China.\nDistribution Centers\nWe distribute our products through distribution centers and warehouses in many of our markets, including in Provo, Utah; Shanghai, China; Chungcheong buk-do, South Korea; Venlo, Netherlands; and Tokyo, Japan.\nResearch and Development Centers\nWe operate research and development centers in Provo, Utah, and in Shanghai, China.\nManufacturing Facilities\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in Mainland China, and in 2018 we acquired two manufacturing companies in Utah.\nRetail Stores, Service Centers, Walk-in Centers and Pick-up Locations\nWe operate walk-in centers and pick-up locations in many of our markets.
