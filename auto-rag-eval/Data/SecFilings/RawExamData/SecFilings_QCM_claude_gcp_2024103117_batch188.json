The company has a total of 144 restaurants (129 Joe's Crab Shack + 15 Brick House Tavern + Tap). The document states that \"Only two of our leases are set to expire without provisions for renewal within the next five years.\" This represents 2 out of 144 restaurants, or approximately 1.4%.

The documentation states that approximately 21,200 square feet under the current lease will no longer be included after the end of September 2013, and this space has been subleased. The company is utilizing the remaining approximately 28,600 square feet under a lease that terminates at the end of September 2018.

Calculate the total square footage of all stores: 798 * 18,000 = 14,364,000 sq ft\n2. Subtract the square footage of owned stores: 6 * 18,000 = 108,000 sq ft\n3. The remaining square footage is leased: 14,364,000 - 108,000 = 14,256,000 sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the approximate leased space assuming all stores are of average size. Since the company owns 6 stores and leases the rest (792), we calculate:\n792 * 18,000 = 14,256,000 sq ft\n\nThe correct answer is B) 14,364,000 square feet, which represents the total retail space, including both owned and leased stores, assuming all are of average size.
