Total given: $623,659\n\nThe warehouse lease includes a 3-month rent abatement of $113,412. To calculate the full year's rent without abatement, we need to add this back:\n\n$623,659 + $113,412 = $737,071\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because the Macau office lease was renewed on May 1, 2016, with a new annual rent of $16,154. We need to adjust for this:\n\n$737,071 - $15,484 (old Macau rent) + $16,154 (new Macau rent) = $737,741\n\nFinally, we need to consider that the corporate headquarters lease expires on December 31, 2016, which is 9 months into the next fiscal year. Assuming the rent remains the same, we need to adjust for a full year:\n\n$737,741 + ($98,885 / 4) = $737,741 + $24,721.25 = $762,462.25\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us $762,462.\n\nThe closest answer to this is B) $680,225, although it's still off by a significant amount.
