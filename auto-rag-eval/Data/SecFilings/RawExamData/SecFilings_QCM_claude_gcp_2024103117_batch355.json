However, this is not the most significant information in the context of the question about consolidating operations based on lease expiration dates.\n\nThe key to this question is recognizing that the Chicago lease provides the longest operational timeframe, expiring last in 2009, making it the most strategic choice for consolidation if all other leases were allowed to expire."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1124827_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1124827", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.
