However, the question is designed to be difficult, and there's a subtle detail to consider. The lease for Brea, California and Northbrook, Illinois is mentioned as \"aggregate monthly lease payments of $8,265.\" This likely includes both facilities.

Sum up the leased office spaces:\n   Brasilia (HQ + Brasilia System): 37,000 sq ft\n   Goiania System: 29,000 sq ft\n   Belem System: 22,000 sq ft\n   Campina Grande System: 16,000 sq ft\n   Total: 37,000 + 29,000 + 22,000 + 16,000 = 104,000 sq ft\n\n2. Calculate the percentage of the Brasilia office:\n   (37,000 / 104,000) * 100 = 35.58%\n\nThe question is tricky because it mentions owned property (the lot in Brasilia and 1,500 sq ft in Goiania) which should not be included in the calculation of leased space. Additionally, it requires careful reading to distinguish between the total leased space and the specific Brasilia leased space."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1559998_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1559998", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "ITEM 2.
