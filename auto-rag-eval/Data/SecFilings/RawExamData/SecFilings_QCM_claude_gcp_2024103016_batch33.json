However, their presence in East Asia is limited compared to their European footprint. Expanding into other East Asian countries like China and Thailand would build upon their existing Asian operations while filling gaps in their global manufacturing network. This strategy aligns with their current international presence and diversification approach.\n\nOption A is less likely as the company has no current presence in South America or Australia, making it a more risky expansion.\nOption B is less optimal because the company already has a strong presence in Europe with facilities in multiple countries.\nOption D focuses on domestic growth, which doesn't align with the company's evident strategy of global diversification."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1086222_2001.htm", "docs_id": "1086222", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

If they decide to exercise their option to renew leases on 75% of their leased properties for the maximum renewal period mentioned, and assuming all leases are eligible for renewal, how many theatre locations would have lease terms extended by up to 20 years?\n\nA) 65\nB) 129\nC) 172\nD) 237\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful reading and multiple steps to solve:\n\n1. The company owns 65 theatres and leases 172 theatres.\n2. The question asks about renewing leases, so we focus on the 172 leased theatres.\n3. They decide to renew 75% of the leased properties.\n4. To calculate 75% of 172: 172 * 0.75 = 129\n5. The document states that renewal periods can be up to 20 years.\n\nTherefore, 129 theatre locations would have lease terms extended by up to 20 years.\n\nOption A (65) is incorrect as it refers to the number of owned theatres, not leased ones.\nOption C (172) is incorrect as it's the total number of leased theatres, not 75% of them.\nOption D (237) is incorrect as it's the total number of theatres (owned + leased), not the number of renewed leases."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "825313_2004.htm", "docs_id": "825313", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 2.
