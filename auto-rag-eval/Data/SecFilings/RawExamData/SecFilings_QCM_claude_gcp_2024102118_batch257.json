This strategy aligns best with the company's current geographical distribution and expansion pattern for several reasons:\n\n1. Regional focus: The company has a strong presence in the Midwest and neighboring states. Missouri fits this regional pattern.\n\n2. Gradual expansion: The company tends to have a moderate number of stores in most states, typically between 2 and 27 (with Nebraska being an outlier at 47). Opening 8 stores in Missouri would be consistent with this approach.\n\n3. Existing presence: The company already has 2 stores in Missouri, suggesting it has some familiarity with the market. Expanding from 2 to 10 stores represents a logical growth step.\n\n4. Avoiding oversaturation: Option A (20 stores in California) and D (30 stores in Texas) represent too aggressive an expansion for a company that typically has fewer than 30 stores per state.\n\n5.

The documentation states that \"Under the terms of the existing NELHA lease, we could be required to remove improvements at the end of the lease term.\" However, it also mentions that the company does not believe the projected cost for such removal to be reasonably estimable or likely, given historical practices.

The identical statements across multiple subsidiaries (AEGCO, AEP, APCO, CSPCO, I&M, KEPCO, and OPCO) all refer to Item 14 for the financial statements and supplementary data. This approach is common in SEC filings when a parent company files a consolidated report that includes financial information for all its subsidiaries. The financial statements and supplementary data for all entities are typically presented together in Item 14, which allows for a more comprehensive and efficient presentation of the company's financial position.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this approach is not about concealing information, but rather organizing it efficiently.
