Calculate total owned space: 65% of 15 million = 9.75 million sq ft\n2. Calculate total leased space: 35% of 15 million = 5.25 million sq ft\n3. Calculate unused owned space: 68% of 1 million = 0.68 million sq ft\n4. Calculate total used owned space: 9.75 million - 0.68 million = 9.07 million sq ft\n5. Calculate total used space: 15 million - 1 million = 14 million sq ft\n6. Calculate used leased space: 14 million - 9.07 million = 4.93 million sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the approximate value, and the closest option to 4.93 million is 5.25 million square feet, which is the total leased space.
