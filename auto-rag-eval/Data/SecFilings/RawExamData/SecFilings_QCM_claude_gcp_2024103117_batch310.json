The pattern of financial events throughout the year strongly suggests that the company is undergoing a significant restructuring and expansion process. The gain on sale of assets in the first quarter could be part of divesting non-core assets. The major acquisition of Viasystems in May and the associated high acquisition costs in the second quarter indicate a significant expansion.
