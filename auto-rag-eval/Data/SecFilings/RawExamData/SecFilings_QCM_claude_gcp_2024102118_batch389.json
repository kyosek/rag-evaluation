The company made changes to its allocation of purchase price related to acquisitions, which affected previously reported figures for acquisition, restructuring, and other expenses, as well as net income per share. However, the reclassification of financial results related to the sale of certain product lines and technologies did not impact net income, but required restatement of previous Form 10-Qs to reflect the reclassification from net revenue to income from sale of technologies and product lines.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while reclassifications were made, they did not affect net income.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the changes affected previously reported figures, not just the current fiscal year.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation states that the quarter ended June 30, 1997, was comprised of 14 weeks, not 13 weeks like the others."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "1057083_2004.txt", "docs_id": "1057083", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nIn November 2004, the company purchased a building with approximately 75,000 square feet located in Bloomingdale, Illinois for APG.

The acquisition of ConsumerCo in 2000 for $13,111.0 million, including $8,879.0 million in intangibles, followed by a goodwill impairment of $8,077.8 million in 2001, strongly suggests that the acquisition was overvalued.

While the impairments and costs are significant, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate severe financial distress without more information about the company's overall financial position and cash flows.\n\nOption C is not the best answer because the loss on the sale of ConsumerCo's off-net indirect access customers, while smaller than the goodwill impairment, is still substantial at $88.5 million.
