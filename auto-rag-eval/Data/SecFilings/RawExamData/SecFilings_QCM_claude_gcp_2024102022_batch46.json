The tricky part is that the rent for the executive office suites was reduced \"beginning 2002.\" This could be interpreted as the reduction taking effect at the start of 2002 or at some point during 2002.

Additionally, the last paragraph indicates that acquiring property in which a director has an interest requires approval by a majority of the Board of Directors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states all banking offices were owned, which contradicts the 65% leased information.
