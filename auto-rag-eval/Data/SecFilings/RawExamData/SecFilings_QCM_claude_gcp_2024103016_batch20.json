The document states that approximately $1,600,000 was paid in 2017. Assuming similar amounts for 2008 and 2009, we add:\n$1,600,000 * 3 = $4,800,000\n\nTotal payments = $8,610,000 (Farm 1) + $3,280,000 (Farm 2 annual) + $4,800,000 (Farm 2 installments) = $16,690,000\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is $16,225,000, which is option C."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "1052637_1998.txt", "docs_id": "1052637", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

The new building's 14,000 square feet is described as \"potential manufacturing, warehouse and office space.\" Given that the company's existing facilities have a much higher proportion of manufacturing space compared to office and warehouse space, it's reasonable to assume that most of the new space will be used for manufacturing.\n\nThe company also already owns 11,000 square feet of manufacturing space in the main facility and 7,500 square feet in the adjacent building, totaling 18,500 square feet.

It specifically mentions that this includes \"an approximately 38,000 square foot, two story office center that houses the administrative staff, research laboratories, computer services and the test salon.\" This matches exactly with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it has the correct total square footage, it incorrectly states a 25,000 sq ft single-story office center.\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the total square footage (476,000 instead of 438,000), even though it correctly identifies the office center.\nOption D is incorrect on both counts, overstating the total square footage and mischaracterizing the office center.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and synthesize multiple pieces of information from a dense text, requiring attention to detail and accurate recall."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1002114_1997.txt", "docs_id": "1002114", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

The documentation states that Pixar paid $5.8 million to purchase the land in Emeryville, which would decrease their cash reserves. Additionally, it mentions that Pixar will incur \"substantial capital expenditures in 1998 and 1999\" to construct the facility. The text also indicates that Pixar has been using its \"existing cash resources to fund facility-related costs\" but may need to consider additional financing options in the future, such as \"issuance of additional equity or debt securities, by obtaining a credit facility or by some other financing mechanism.\" This supports the idea of a decrease in cash reserves and a potential need for additional financing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while debt financing is mentioned as a possibility, it's not stated as an immediate or definite action.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no mention of increased rental expenses during the transition. In fact, the new facility would likely replace their current leased space, potentially reducing rental expenses in the long term.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document explicitly states that capital expenditures will increase, not decrease, in 1998 and 1999 due to the construction of the new facility."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "904979_2002.htm", "docs_id": "904979", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "Item 2.
