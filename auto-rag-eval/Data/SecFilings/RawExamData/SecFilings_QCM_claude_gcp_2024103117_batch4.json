DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nLannett owns two facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from where all operations are based. The administrative offices, quality control laboratory, and manufacturing and production facilities are located in a 38,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road in Philadelphia. The second facility consists of 65,000 square feet, and is located within 1 mile of the State Road location, 9001 Torresdale Avenue in Philadelphia. Our research laboratory, package, warehousing and distribution operations, sales and accounting departments are located in the second building.\nIn December 2005, the Company refinanced the mortgages on these two properties. As of June 30, 2006, the mortgage balance was approximately $6 million.\nIn June 2006, Lannett signed a lease agreement on a 66,000 square foot facility located on seven acres in Philadelphia. An additional agreement which gives us the option to buy the facility was also signed. This new facility will hold the warehouse, and will become the future headquarters of the Company. We expect to\nbegin occupying the building in December 2006, with full conversion of the facility to take place over another 6 to 9 months.

According to the documentation, in June 2006, Lannett signed a lease agreement for a new 66,000 square foot facility in Philadelphia, along with an option to buy this facility. The document also states that \"The existing facilities will continue to operate,\" indicating that Lannett is retaining its two current Philadelphia facilities (the 38,000 sq ft facility on State Road and the 65,000 sq ft facility on Torresdale Avenue) while adding this new leased facility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Lannett is leasing, not purchasing, the new facility, and there's no mention of selling the State Road facility.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while Lannett did refinance mortgages on two existing facilities in December 2005, the new facility in 2006 was leased, not purchased.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the new facility is 66,000 sq ft, not 38,000 sq ft, and there's no mention of selling the Torresdale Avenue facility."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "776867_2000.txt", "docs_id": "776867", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

It owned 10 offices outright, owned 1 building but leased the land, and leased the remaining 67 offices.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the total number of offices mentioned is actually 74 (28 bank branches + 31 retail loan offices + 15 wholesale loan production offices), not 59.

The documentation clearly states that SecFilings has \"a concentration of manufacturing (including assembly and test) in Asia, primarily in China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea.\" It also explicitly mentions that if manufacturing in this region were disrupted, their overall production capacity could be significantly reduced. This indicates a potential risk due to the geographical concentration of their manufacturing operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company owns only about 6.3 million square feet out of a total of 9 million square feet, which is not a majority. Additionally, it does have a significant concentration in Asia.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the information provided does not suggest an even spread of facilities across different continents.
