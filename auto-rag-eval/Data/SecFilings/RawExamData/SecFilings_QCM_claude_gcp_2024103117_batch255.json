While the sum of headquarters ($1,268,000) and other offices ($235,220) rental payments for 1995 does equal $1,503,220, this represents projected minimum future rental payments, not necessarily the actual rental expense.\n\nB) This is correct.

Delray Beach office: $4,003.90 x 12 = $48,046.80\n2. Storage facility: $202 x 12 = $2,424\n3. Fredrickstown warehouse: $1,000 x 12 = $12,000\n4.

The Fredrickstown warehouse lease started in October, so we need to add 3 more months to make it a full year:\n\nAdditional cost for Fredrickstown: $1,000 x 3 = $3,000\n\nNew total: $81,670.80 + $3,000 = $84,670.80\n\nFinally, we need to account for the initial Delray Beach office lease, which had a lower rate before switching to month-to-month:\n\nDifference in monthly rate: $4,003.90 - $3,813 = $190.90\nAdditional cost for a full year at the higher rate: $190.90 x 12 = $2,290.80\n\nFinal total: $84,670.80 + $2,290.80 = $93,650.80\n\nTherefore, the correct annual leasing cost if all leases were active for a full year is $93,650.80."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "1002390_2001.htm", "docs_id": "1002390", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2 - Facilities\nThe Company's headquarters and principal management, sales and marketing and support facility is located in Fremont, California, and consists of approximately 18,400 square feet under a lease that will expire in February 2003.

The documentation clearly outlines a two-step relocation process for Ariba. First, the company plans to move from its Palo Alto facilities to a temporary location in Sunnyvale over the first two quarters of 2000. This Sunnyvale lease will expire in July 2001. Second, Ariba plans to move into its new corporate headquarters in San Jose, which is scheduled for completion by June 2001.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the temporary move to Sunnyvale.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the new San Jose headquarters is scheduled for completion by June 2001, not by the end of 2000.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the company plans to exit its Palo Alto facilities in early 2000, not maintain them throughout the year.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and synthesize information about a company's complex relocation plans, requiring attention to detail and chronological understanding."}}
