The percentage of owned towers out of total towers\n2. The number of towers they planned to sell\n\n1.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The text states \"With the exception of 11 locations which are owned, all other offices are leased from unaffiliated third parties.\" This indicates that 11 locations are owned, while the rest are leased.\n\n2. The company conducts business through \"24 full service banking offices\" in various metropolitan areas, but these are not all owned.\n\n3.
