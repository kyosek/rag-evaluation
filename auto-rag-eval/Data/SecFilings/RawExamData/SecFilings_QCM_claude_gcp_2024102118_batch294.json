The annual rated capacity for Plant 3 is approximately 71,000 gst. Industrial and municipal castings are produced in both plants. Rated capacity is based on an assumed product mix and, due to the Company's current industrial product mix, which includes numerous complex castings, practical capacity is currently approximately 5% to 6% less than rated capacity. The Company owns seven and leases six distribution and sales centers. In early 1994, the Company closed Plant 1, its oldest and lowest capacity plant, which was primarily producing large castings for HVAC Systems.

The question specifically asks about ductile iron casting production, and the documentation states that \"Plant 3 produces ductile iron castings.\" While Plant 2 can produce both gray and ductile iron castings, Plant 3 is specialized in ductile iron. Additionally, Plant 3 is equipped with two Disamatic molding machines specifically for this purpose. Plant 1 is not a viable option as it was closed in 1994. The practical capacity being slightly less than rated capacity applies to both plants and doesn't significantly impact the decision.

Staggered lease terms: The lease commencement dates range from April 2003 to May 2008, with expiration dates between April 2010 and January 2022. This suggests a deliberate strategy to avoid having all leases expire simultaneously.\n\n2. Optimization of space usage: The company sublets excess space in three locations, indicating efforts to maximize the utility of leased properties.\n\n3. Adaptability: Most leases contain rent escalation provisions and renewal options, allowing for adjustments to changing market conditions and business needs.\n\n4. Mix of property types: The company leases various types of properties including branch offices, administrative spaces, and parking areas, showing a tailored approach to different operational requirements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company leases rather than owns its properties. Answer B is wrong as subleasing is mentioned for only three locations and is not described as a significant revenue stream.

Calculate the total number of encumbered properties:\n   Ground leases: 10\n   Mortgages: 39\n   Total encumbered: 10 + 39 = 49\n\n2. Calculate the current percentage of encumbered properties:\n   49 / 179 = 27.37%\n\n3. Calculate 15% of total properties:\n   179 * 0.15 = 26.85 (round down to 26)\n\n4. Determine how many unencumbered properties can be sold without increasing the percentage of encumbered properties:\n   Total unencumbered: 179 - 49 = 130\n   Let x be the number of properties sold\n   (49 / (179 - x)) \u2264 27.37%\n   Solving this inequality: x \u2264 22.4\n\nTherefore, the REIT can sell a maximum of 22 properties while keeping the percentage of encumbered properties at or below 27.37%.
