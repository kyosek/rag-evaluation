It also mentions the possibility of an additional $50,000 incentive payment if certain conditions are met over the next two years. These conditions are specifically related to \"adding employees and their average annual wage.\" Therefore, the total potential incentive is $100,000 ($50,000 received + $50,000 potential), and the primary conditions for the additional incentive are related to employment and wages.\n\nOption B is incorrect because expanding the facility is not mentioned as a condition for the incentive.
