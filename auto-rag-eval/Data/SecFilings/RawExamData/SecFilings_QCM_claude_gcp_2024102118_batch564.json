Miami, FL: 10,000 sq ft, lease expires in 2003\n\nTo determine the year with the least leased square footage:\n\n- After 2000, the Saugus property lease expires, leaving 167,000 sq ft (157,000 + 10,000)\n- After 2003, the Miami property lease expires, leaving 157,000 sq ft (Brentwood only)\n- After 2005, all leases expire if not renewed\n\nThe correct answer is B (2003) because this is the year when the company would have the least amount of leased square footage (157,000 sq ft) if no leases were renewed. This is less than the initial total (272,000 sq ft), the amount after 2000 (167,000 sq ft), and assumes the Brentwood lease is not yet expired."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "717306_2002.htm", "docs_id": "717306", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "Item 2.
