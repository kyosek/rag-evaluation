What does this impairment suggest about the company's assessment of the lease, and what are the implications for the company's financial statements?\n\nA) The company expects higher future cash flows from the lease and is increasing its book value.\nB) The impairment indicates that the lease's carrying value exceeds its fair value, resulting in a reduction of the asset's value on the balance sheet and a loss on the income statement.\nC) The impairment is a routine accounting procedure with no significant impact on the company's financial position.\nD) The company is writing off the entire value of the lease and terminating the agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. When a company records an impairment on an asset, it means that the carrying value of the asset on the books exceeds its fair value or recoverable amount.
