Let's break it down:\n\nFirst quarter: No significant charges mentioned.\nSecond quarter: $0.9 million restructuring charge.\nThird quarter: $0.4 million restructuring charge.\nFourth quarter: $4.2 million restructuring charge and $2.6 million impairment of long-lived assets charge.\n\nThe fourth quarter clearly had the highest combined impact, with a total of $6.8 million ($4.2 million + $2.6 million) in charges. This is significantly higher than any other quarter in 2008.\n\nOption A is incorrect as there were no notable charges in the first quarter.\nOption B is incorrect as the second quarter only had a $0.9 million restructuring charge.\nOption C is incorrect as the third quarter only had a $0.4 million restructuring charge.\nOption D is correct as it represents the quarter with the highest combined financial impact from restructuring and impairment charges in 2008.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze financial data across multiple periods and identify the most significant financial events."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "34782_1998.txt", "docs_id": "34782", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n1st Source's headquarters building is located in downtown South Bend. In 1982, the land was leased from the City of South Bend on a 49-year lease, with a 50-year renewal option.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. We're asked to calculate for 2005, excluding the corporate headquarters.\n2. The total annual lease payments for additional facilities is stated as approximately $1.6 million.\n3.

Assuming these leases are renewed at the same rates, we still need to account for Charleston's lease expiring in 2003.\n\n5. We don't have individual lease amounts, so we need to estimate. If we assume Charleston's lease is proportional to its square footage compared to the total (2,500 out of 110,724 sq ft of additional office space), it would account for about 2.26% of the $1.6 million, or approximately $36,000.\n\n6.
