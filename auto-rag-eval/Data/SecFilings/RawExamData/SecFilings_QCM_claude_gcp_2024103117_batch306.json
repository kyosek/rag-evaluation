Option C is correct because:\n\n1. The building is described as 100 ft. by 100 ft., which equals 10,000 square feet total.\n2. One section measuring 50 ft. by 100 ft. (5,000 sq ft) is used by civic organizations and will be modified into office spaces as needed.\n3. The other section is described as \"roughly 10,000 square feet of office space,\" which is likely an approximation of the remaining 5,000 sq ft.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they state the building has 20,000 square feet total, which contradicts the given dimensions.
