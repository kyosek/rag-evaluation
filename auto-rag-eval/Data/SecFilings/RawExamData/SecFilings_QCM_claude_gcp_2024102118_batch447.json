The company owns 244 acres in the Cleveland area, with manufacturing facilities covering approximately 3,017,090 square feet. If the company decides to expand its Cleveland operations by 15% in terms of manufacturing space, while maintaining the same ratio of manufacturing space to total property area, approximately how many additional acres would the company need to acquire?\n\nA) 15.6 acres\nB) 36.6 acres\nC) 51.2 acres\nD) 67.8 acres\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 36.6 acres\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current ratio of manufacturing space to total property area:\n   3,017,090 sq ft / (244 acres * 43,560 sq ft/acre) \u2248 0.2838 or 28.38%\n\n2. Calculate the new manufacturing space after 15% expansion:\n   3,017,090 sq ft * 1.15 = 3,469,653.5 sq ft\n\n3. Calculate the new total property area needed to maintain the same ratio:\n   3,469,653.5 sq ft / 0.2838 = 12,225,699.1 sq ft\n\n4. Convert the new total area to acres:\n   12,225,699.1 sq ft / 43,560 sq ft/acre \u2248 280.6 acres\n\n5. Calculate the additional acres needed:\n   280.6 acres - 244 acres = 36.6 acres\n\nTherefore, the company would need to acquire approximately 36.6 additional acres to expand its manufacturing space by 15% while maintaining the same ratio of manufacturing space to total property area."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1276591_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1276591", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "ITEM 1.
