Which of the following locations would be the LEAST suitable option based on the information provided?\n\nA) Atlanta, Georgia\nB) Chicago, Illinois\nC) Glasgow, Scotland\nD) Washington, DC\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThis question requires careful analysis of the information provided in the document. Let's break down each option:\n\nA) Atlanta, Georgia - The document specifically mentions that SecFilings has leased space in Atlanta, Georgia, where they run research operations. This makes it a suitable option.\n\nB) Chicago, Illinois - While Chicago is mentioned as one of the locations where SecFilings leases office space, it's not described as a principal facility or research operation center. It's listed among \"other metropolitan areas,\" suggesting it might be a smaller or less significant location.\n\nC) Glasgow, Scotland - The document states that SecFilings runs research operations out of a leased space in Glasgow, Scotland, making it a key location for the company.\n\nD) Washington, DC - This is where SecFilings' headquarters is located, occupying a significant amount of space (149,500 square feet). Additionally, they mention having two facilities in downtown Washington, DC.\n\nGiven this analysis, Chicago (option B) appears to be the least significant location among the choices provided, making it the least suitable option for a company looking to expand its operations in connection with SecFilings' facilities. The other locations are either headquarters, principal facilities, or research operation centers, which would likely offer more resources and opportunities for collaboration."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "774569_2015.htm", "docs_id": "774569", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The document states that \"The Hubbard, Niles Park Plaza and Boardman offices are leased, while all of the other offices are owned by Cortland Banks.\" There are 13 offices listed in total, so 13 - 3 = 10 offices are owned.\n\n2.

The main administrative office is actually in Cortland, Ohio (194 West Main Street), not Beachwood, which eliminates option A.\n\n4.
