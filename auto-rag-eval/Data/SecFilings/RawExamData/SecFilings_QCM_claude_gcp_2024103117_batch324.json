The company owns only a few properties: a 50,000 sq ft office building in Deerfield Beach, small staffing offices in Chicago and Waukegan, and a condominium in Boca Raton.\n2. In contrast, the company leases 131 facilities, primarily staffing office locations, totaling approximately 300,000 sq ft.\n3. The annual base rent for these leased facilities is about $2.8 million, suggesting these are smaller, more affordable spaces rather than large corporate offices.\n4. The company states it believes its facilities are generally adequate and doesn't anticipate difficulty replacing or adding facilities if needed, indicating a flexible approach.\n\nThis leasing-heavy strategy with a few owned properties suggests a focus on maintaining a flexible and scalable physical presence, which is typical for staffing companies that need to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company owns only one large office building and primarily leases smaller spaces. Option C is wrong because the company does own some properties. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of owning large warehouse spaces; only a small leased warehouse is mentioned."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "877422_2012.htm", "docs_id": "877422", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.
