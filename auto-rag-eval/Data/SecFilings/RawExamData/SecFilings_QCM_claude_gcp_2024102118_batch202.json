Additionally, the occupancy data shows that the lowest rate in the given 5-year period was indeed 92.7% in 2001.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it wrongly states the lump-sum payment is due in 2012, and while 2003 did have the highest occupancy, this isn't the key point asked about the occupancy data.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it fails to mention the lump-sum payment and incorrectly states that occupancy consistently increased, which is not true according to the data.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it states the mortgage details are not specified (which they are) and provides inaccurate occupancy trend information."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "940716_1998.txt", "docs_id": "940716", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
