Calculate the total number of off-lease containers:\n   16% of 8,452 = 1,352 containers\n\n2. Calculate 5% of the off-lease containers (those identified for sale):\n   5% of 1,352 = 68 containers\n\n3.

Unlike typical business entities, the Trust's only \"business\" is to collect payments on the Mortgage Loans and distribute them to Certificateholders.

The documentation states that the Company operates 63 dialysis centers, \"six of which are located in owned facilities and the remainder of which are located in leased facilities.\" Additionally, it mentions that the Company owns its corporate headquarters in Oak Park, Illinois. For the leased facilities, the document specifies that \"These leases generally have terms of 10 years and typically contain renewal options.\" This information directly corresponds to option C, which accurately represents the Company's mix of owned and leased properties, as well as the typical lease terms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company doesn't own all its properties, and the lease term is inaccurate. Option B is wrong because the Company does own some properties, and the lease term and renewal option information is incorrect.
