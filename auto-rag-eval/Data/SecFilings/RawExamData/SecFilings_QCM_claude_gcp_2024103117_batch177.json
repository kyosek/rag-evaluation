The documentation states that FGIC-SPI has standby purchase agreements with issuers of floating rate municipal securities. Under these agreements, FGIC-SPI is obligated to purchase unremarketed securities at par from holders who wish to sell. To manage its own liquidity risk, FGIC-SPI has entered into standby loan agreements with GE Capital, which is irrevocably obligated to lend funds to FGIC-SPI as needed to purchase these securities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because FGIC-SPI does not directly remarket the securities; this is typically done by registered broker-dealers.\n\nOption B is incorrect because FGIC-SPI purchases the securities at par, not market value, and does not resell them to GE Capital.\n\nOption D is incorrect because FGIC-SPI's role is not described as a guarantor ensuring timely payment, but rather as a liquidity provider in case of failed remarketings."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "914025_1997.txt", "docs_id": "914025", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding AutoZone's distribution centers?\n\nA) AutoZone owns all of its distribution centers, with a total square footage of 4.6 million.\nB) AutoZone leases approximately 2.7 million square feet of distribution center space and owns the remaining 1.9 million square feet.\nC) AutoZone has nine distribution centers, with two additional centers under construction in Mexico.\nD) AutoZone leases approximately 1.9 million square feet of distribution center space and owns the remaining 2.7 million square feet.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The document states that AutoZone has \"approximately 4.6 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our AutoZone stores, of which approximately 1.9 million square feet is leased and the remainder is owned.\" This means that AutoZone leases 1.9 million square feet and owns the remaining 2.7 million square feet (4.6 million - 1.9 million = 2.7 million).\n\nOption A is incorrect because AutoZone does not own all of its distribution centers; some are leased.\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the leased and owned square footage.\nOption C is incorrect because while AutoZone does have nine distribution centers, only one additional center in Mexico is mentioned as being under construction, not two. The document also mentions two additional domestic distribution centers under development, but these are separate from the Mexico facility."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "786947_2011.htm", "docs_id": "786947", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "ITEM 2.
