While the Waltham lease is short-term (3 years), Lionbridge has demonstrated a mix of short-term and long-term lease strategies globally. The Dublin office has leases extending to 2025-2026, indicating comfort with long-term commitments in key locations. As the headquarters houses principal administrative, finance, legal, and marketing operations, it's likely that Lionbridge would seek a more stable, longer-term arrangement for this crucial location after the current lease expires. This aligns with their statement about obtaining additional space as needed on commercially reasonable terms, suggesting a flexible but strategic approach to office space globally.
