The company leased spaces in North America, Europe, and Asia for various purposes such as sales, marketing, and technical support. However, it specifically mentions that in September 1996, the company purchased a 376,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia.

The only purchased property mentioned is in Malaysia.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no indication of an equal distribution between owned and leased properties.

The passage states that the company \"currently lease[s] approximately 67% of our restaurant sites\" and that \"In the future, we intend to continue to construct and own a significant number of new restaurants on owned or leased land.\" This indicates a strategy of both leasing and owning properties, with plans to increase ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does not lease 100% of its sites; it leases about 67%.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the ownership and leasing percentages. The company leases 67%, not owns 67%.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage specifically mentions that most leases include options for renewal and additional rent based on sales volume: \"Initial lease expirations primarily range from five to ten years, with the majority of the leases providing for an option to renew for at least one additional term\" and \"most leases call for additional rent based on sales volume at the particular location over specified minimum levels.\""}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "880807_2006.htm", "docs_id": "880807", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 2.

The total number of studios is therefore 864 + 117 + 40 = 1,021. To calculate the percentage of studios in Sears stores in the United States, we divide 864 by 1,021 and multiply by 100, which gives us 84.6%.
