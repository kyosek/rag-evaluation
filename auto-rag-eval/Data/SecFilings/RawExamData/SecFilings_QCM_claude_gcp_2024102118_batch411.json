The documentation states that Cellceutix rents 200 square feet of office space from Kard Scientific on a month-to-month basis. It also mentions that Cellceutix subcontracts laboratory research and development work to Kard Scientific, which occupies 10,000 square feet in the same building. Importantly, the document specifies that Cellceutix retains all intellectual property resulting from the services provided by Kard. This arrangement allows Cellceutix to utilize Kard's facilities and expertise while maintaining control over its intellectual property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Cellceutix does not own Kard Scientific, and their arrangement is not exclusive. Option C is wrong because Kard Scientific is not a subsidiary of Cellceutix; they are separate entities with a business relationship. Option D is incorrect because the document clearly shows that the two companies share resources (office space) and have a business relationship (subcontracting of research work)."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "355777_2012.htm", "docs_id": "355777", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Canton, Massachusetts, the lease for which expires in February 2022.
