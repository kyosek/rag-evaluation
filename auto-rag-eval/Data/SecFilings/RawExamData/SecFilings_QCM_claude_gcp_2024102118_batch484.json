The education segment's properties are not primarily in western states, and there's no indication that the information segment owns most of its properties in the eastern U.S.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the information segment does lease properties in 11 states, they are not mostly concentrated in the Midwest.

This means that 997 - 391 = 606 stores were company-operated. The percentage of company-operated stores is (606 / 997) * 100 = 60.8%, which means 39.2% were franchisee-operated.\n\nFor non-retail properties, the document mentions a 50,000 sq ft office space in Salt Lake City and a 40,000 sq ft batter facility in Atlanta.
