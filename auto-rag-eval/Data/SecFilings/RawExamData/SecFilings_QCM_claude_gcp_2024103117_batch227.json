What is the most likely reason for this approach, and what potential issue does it raise?\n\nA) The company is trying to hide the restatement from investors and regulators.\nB) The restatement is immaterial and doesn't require amending previous filings.\nC) The company is following SEC guidance that allows for comprehensive disclosure in the current 10-K instead of amending prior filings.\nD) This approach is standard practice and raises no potential issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The company's approach of not amending previously filed reports but instead providing comprehensive disclosure in the current Form 10-K is often based on SEC guidance. This method is sometimes preferred as it provides all the restated information in one place, making it easier for investors to understand the full impact of the restatement.\n\nHowever, this approach does raise a potential issue: investors or analysts who rely on the originally filed reports without cross-referencing the latest 10-K might be using outdated or incorrect information. This is why it's crucial for users of financial statements to always check the most recent filings for any restatements or corrections to previously reported information.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company is disclosing the restatement in the current 10-K, not hiding it. Answer B is likely incorrect because if the restatement were immaterial, it probably wouldn't be mentioned at all. Answer D is incorrect because while this approach is sometimes used, it's not standard practice for all restatements and does raise potential issues regarding the accuracy of previously filed reports."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "351238_1998.txt", "docs_id": "351238", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning the Bank's sole real property lease commitment:\nRentable Square Expiration of Renewal Banking Offices Footage Current Lease Period(s)\n550 Montgomery Street 89,000 2010 One option for an additional San Francisco, CA 25 years\nThe Bank's headquarters at 550 Montgomery Street is an 89,000 square foot historically significant office building on Clay and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco's Financial District.

The passage states that Old Republic owns the Old Republic Building in Chicago and one other major office building in Minneapolis. Additionally, it mentions that \"Six smaller buildings are owned by Old Republic and its subsidiaries in various parts of the nation.\" This totals eight buildings. The passage also explicitly states, \"The carrying value of all owned buildings and related land at December 31, 2016 was $49.2 million.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because Old Republic owns only two major office buildings, not three, and they are not fully occupied by the company.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the occupancy percentages. The Chicago building is 47% occupied by Old Republic, not 53%.\n\nOption D is close but not entirely accurate. While the total floor space of the two major buildings is correct (261,000 sq ft), the overall occupancy by the company is not 65%. The Chicago building is 47% occupied by Old Republic, and the Minneapolis building is 91% occupied by the Title Insurance Group, which would average to about 66.5%, but this doesn't account for the different sizes of the buildings."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1429764_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1429764", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "ITEM 2.
