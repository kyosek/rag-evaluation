The key is to understand the relationship between the monthly production capacity and the daily yield.\n\nThe factory can produce 1,800,000 plants per month, and the daily yield is 12,000 bags or 2,500 kg of vegetables. To find the growth cycle, we need to calculate how many days it takes to produce 1,800,000 plants.\n\nIf we divide 1,800,000 by the daily production (12,000 bags), we get:\n1,800,000 / 12,000 = 150\n\nThis means it takes 150 batches to produce 1,800,000 plants. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we can calculate the number of batches per day:\n150 / 30 = 5\n\nThis indicates that 5 batches of plants are harvested each day. For this to be possible, the growth cycle must be 10 days, as stated in option B. This allows for a continuous cycle where a new batch is planted every 2 days (10 days / 5 batches), ensuring a constant daily yield."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "77449_2015.htm", "docs_id": "77449", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "ITEM 2 PROPERTIES\nThe Company owns its five-story, approximately 300,000 square foot corporate headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The documentation clearly states that the company uses a mix of owned and leased properties. It mentions \"Franchisee-operated\" properties that are owned by the company and subleased to franchisees, as well as leased corporate headquarters and distribution center in Anaheim. The leases have varying expiration dates through 2023, and many contain renewal options. The staggered expiration dates are not expected to have a material impact on operations in any particular year.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company clearly uses both owned and leased properties. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the leases do not all expire simultaneously in 2023; rather, they have various expiration dates through 2023.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it reverses the ownership status of the facilities.
