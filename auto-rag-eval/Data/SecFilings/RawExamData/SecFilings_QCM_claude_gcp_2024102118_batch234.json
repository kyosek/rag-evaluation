The documentation clearly states that BB&T employs a mixed strategy of both owning and leasing properties. It specifically mentions that BB&T leases its headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, while owning or leasing other significant office spaces nearby. The company owns or leases free-standing operations centers, with primary operations and IT centers located in various places in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. Additionally, BB&T operates retail branches and other offices in multiple states, primarily concentrated in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions, which are either owned or leased.\n\nOption A is incorrect because BB&T does not exclusively lease all properties; it owns some as well. Option B is wrong because the company does not own all properties outright; it leases some, including its headquarters. Option C is incorrect because while BB&T does use a hybrid approach of owning and leasing, its primary focus is not on the Northeastern United States, but rather on the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "19724_1993.txt", "docs_id": "19724", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1993", "text": "ITEM 2.
