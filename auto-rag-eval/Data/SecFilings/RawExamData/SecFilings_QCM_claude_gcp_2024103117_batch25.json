The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The text states that \"the Registrant currently has eight loans in its portfolio.\"\n2. It mentions that \"Ten properties were acquired through foreclosure\" but then notes \"The Registrant sold one of the properties and currently has nine properties.\"\n3. The document explicitly states that \"two loans were reclassified to investment in joint ventures-affiliates.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the original number of loans (34) instead of the current number (8).
