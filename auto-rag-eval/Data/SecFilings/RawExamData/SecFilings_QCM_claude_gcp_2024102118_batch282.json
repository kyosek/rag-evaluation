Therefore, 44,000 \u00f7 44 = 1,000 square feet per state.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it divides the number of restaurants (259) by the office space (44,000).\nOption C is incorrect as it divides the office space (44,000) by the number of restaurants (259).\nOption D is incorrect as it divides the office space (44,000) by 40 instead of 44 states.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read the provided information, identify the relevant data points, and perform a simple division calculation."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "701719_2010.htm", "docs_id": "701719", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.

Properties\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 16 properties. Other than these owned properties, we lease the real property and buildings from which we operate. Our facilities are located in 27 states and consist of offices, shops and fabrication, maintenance and warehouse facilities. Generally, leases range from three to ten years and are on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable. A majority of these premises are leased from individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship. In certain instances, these leases are with current or former employees. To the extent we renew, enter into leases or otherwise change leases with current or former employees, we enter into such agreements on terms that reflect a fair market valuation for the properties. Leased premises range in size from approximately 1,000 square feet to 110,000 square feet. To maximize available capital, we generally intend to continue to lease our properties, but may consider further purchases of property where we believe ownership would be more economical.

The documentation states that as of December 31, 2020, the company owned 16 properties. It also mentions that other than these owned properties, they lease the real property and buildings from which they operate. The facilities are located in 27 states, and the company generally intends to continue leasing properties to maximize available capital. This aligns with option C, which accurately summarizes the company's mixed ownership/leasing strategy and the preference for leasing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company does own 16 properties and has facilities in 27 states, it doesn't own all of its properties.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it misrepresents the lease terms. The document states that leases generally range from three to ten years, not five to fifteen.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it wrongly suggests that all 16 owned properties are in Houston, Texas.
