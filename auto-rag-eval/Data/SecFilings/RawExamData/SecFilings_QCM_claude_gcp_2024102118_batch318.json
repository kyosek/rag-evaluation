DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES\nThe Company leases substantially all of its store facilities under operating leases that generally have terms of three to five years and require the Company to pay real estate taxes, utilities and maintenance. The Company has optional renewal privileges on most of its leases for additional periods ranging from three to five years at rental rates generally adjusted for increases in the cost of living. There is no assurance that the Company can renew the leases that do not contain renewal options, or that if it can renew them, that the terms will be favorable to the Company. Management believes that suitable store space is generally available for lease and that the Company would be able to relocate any of its stores without significant difficulty should it be unable to renew a particular lease. Management also expects that additional space will be readily available at competitive rates for new store openings. The Company owns its corporate headquarters located in Erie, Pennsylvania, which comprises 74,000 square feet. The Company owns an office building in Erie, Pennsylvania, which was a satellite office of its former headquarters and is now listed for sale.

The company leases \"substantially all of its store facilities\" under short-term operating leases (three to five years), which provides flexibility. However, many leases have renewal options, though not guaranteed. The company also owns key corporate facilities, including its 74,000 square foot headquarters and an 8,200 square foot building for record retention in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company has some owned properties, most store facilities are on short-term leases without guaranteed long-term control.\n\nAnswer B is overly pessimistic. While there are short-term leases, the company has renewal options on most leases, and management believes suitable space is generally available if relocation is necessary.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the text clearly states the company leases substantially all of its store facilities rather than purchasing them.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the company's strategy of maintaining flexibility with leased retail spaces while owning critical corporate infrastructure."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "34151_1998.txt", "docs_id": "34151", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
