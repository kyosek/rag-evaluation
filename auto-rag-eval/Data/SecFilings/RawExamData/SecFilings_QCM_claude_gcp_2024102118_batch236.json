The company indeed has a mixed portfolio of owned and leased properties. It owns 226 branches, some on leased land, indicating a mix of ownership structures. The significant owned presence in San Antonio is evident from the 545,000 square-foot office complex on a 111-acre site. The documentation also explicitly states that the company \"continuously evaluates the suitability and adequacy of the Company's offices and has a program of relocating or remodeling them as necessary,\" which aligns with the strategy mentioned in the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company does have properties in 9 states, not all 226 branches are fully owned on company-owned land. Some are on leased land.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the main operational hub appears to be in San Antonio, Texas, not Oakland, California.
