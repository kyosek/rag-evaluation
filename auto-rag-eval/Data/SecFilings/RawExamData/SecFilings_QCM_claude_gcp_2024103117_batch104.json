Based on the information provided, what is the total annual rent expense for the company's active leases as of the end of fiscal year 1998, excluding any facilities that were liquidated or assigned to other parties?\n\nA) $180,000\nB) $120,000\nC) $234,000\nD) $156,000\n\nCorrect Answer: B) $120,000\n\nExplanation: To calculate the correct annual rent expense, we need to consider only the active leases at the end of fiscal year 1998. Let's break it down:\n\n1. California facility: $5,000 per month * 12 months = $60,000 per year\n2. SEEPZ facilities in India: $5,000 per month * 12 months = $60,000 per year\n\nThe Sri Lanka facility lease was assigned to a related party during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, so it's no longer an expense for the company. The Scotland facility was liquidated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 to satisfy liabilities, so it's also not included in the ongoing rent expense.\n\nTherefore, the total annual rent expense for active leases is:\n$60,000 (California) + $60,000 (India) = $120,000\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, identify relevant data, and perform accurate calculations while excluding non-applicable expenses."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "819793_2003.htm", "docs_id": "819793", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.

Let's break it down:\n\nA) Houston and Jackson - Incorrect. While Jackson's lease expires in 2005, which is before 2008, one of Houston's leases expires in 2007 and the other in 2010. This means the company would still be bound by a lease in Houston in 2008.\n\nB) Garden City and San Francisco - Correct. Both of these leases expire in 2007, which means by 2008, the company would be free to relocate from both these locations without breaking any lease agreements.\n\nC) Dallas and Hunt Valley - Incorrect. Both of these leases expire in 2006, which is before 2008. However, the question asks for the \"most immediate opportunity\" in 2008, and there are other options that expire closer to 2008.\n\nD) Charlotte and Los Angeles - Incorrect. The Charlotte lease expires in 2009 and the Los Angeles lease in 2012, both of which are after 2008. Relocating from these cities in 2008 would require breaking existing lease agreements.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease information, and to identify the most suitable option based on a specific timeframe."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "814139_2004.htm", "docs_id": "814139", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.

However, Uniflow has a larger total square footage with 30,300 + 16,700 + 32,000 = 79,000 square feet.\n\nB) Incorrect.
