If the resort wanted to maximize its hotel occupancy while maintaining some longer-term rental options, what would be the optimal configuration of units in the Rental Pool, assuming all units in the Walking Village are included?\n\nA) 408 hotel units from Walking Village + 121 units from Lakeside Village\nB) 408 hotel units from Walking Village + 148 units from Lakeside Village\nC) 529 total units, with some three-bedroom units split into a two-bedroom suite and a separate hotel room\nD) 556 total units, with all condominiums participating in the Rental Pool\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful analysis of the given information. We know that:\n1. There are 556 total condominium units.\n2. 408 units are in the Walking Village, designed for hotel occupancy.\n3. 148 units are in the Lakeside Village, designed for longer-term rental.\n4. At December 31, 2014, there were 529 hotel accommodations in the Rental Pool.\n5. Three-bedroom units can be split into a two-bedroom suite and a separate hotel room.\n\nOption C is correct because it aligns with the total number of units in the Rental Pool (529) while also accounting for the flexible use of three-bedroom units to maximize occupancy. This configuration allows for some Lakeside Village units to remain available for longer-term rentals while optimizing hotel capacity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the full 529 units in the Rental Pool.\nOption B is incorrect because it would include all Lakeside Village units, leaving no options for longer-term rentals.\nOption D is incorrect because it exceeds the number of units in the Rental Pool and doesn't allow for any longer-term rental options."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1157303_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1157303", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.
