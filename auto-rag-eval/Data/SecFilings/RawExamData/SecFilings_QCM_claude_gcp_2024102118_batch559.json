Calculate the amount that would be distributed to each quarter:\n   $1,500,000 / 4 = $375,000\n\n2. Convert $375,000 to thousands to match the given data:\n   $375,000 / 1000 = $375 thousand\n\n3. Calculate the new first quarter revenue:\n   $92,632 + $375 = $93,007 thousand\n\n4. Calculate the percentage increase:\n   ($93,007 - $92,632) / $92,632 * 100 = 0.41%\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret financial data, understand the impact of adjustments, and perform percentage calculations.
