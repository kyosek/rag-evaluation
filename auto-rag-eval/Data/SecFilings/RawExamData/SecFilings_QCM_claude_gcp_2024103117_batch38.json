As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding loan balance was MYR75,012. Given the information provided, what is the approximate annual interest rate of this loan, and what potential financial risk does the company face?\n\nA) Annual interest rate is about 2.06%, and the company faces exchange rate risk due to the loan being denominated in MYR.\nB) Annual interest rate is about 3.94%, and the company faces no significant financial risks.\nC) Annual interest rate is about 6.06%, and the company faces interest rate risk due to the floating rate nature of the loan.\nD) Annual interest rate is about 5%, and the company faces both exchange rate and interest rate risks.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The loan bears interest at the base lending rate less 3.94% per annum. While we don't know the exact base lending rate, we can estimate the interest rate by calculating the reduction in the loan balance over the first year. The loan decreased from MYR80,000 to MYR75,012 in about 13 months, a reduction of MYR4,988. This represents an interest rate of approximately 2.06% annually.\n\nThe documentation explicitly states that loans acquired for the motor vehicle are denominated in MYR and are \"subjected to the fluctuation in reporting currency.\" This indicates that the company faces exchange rate risk, as the value of the loan in the company's reporting currency may fluctuate based on exchange rates between MYR and the reporting currency.\n\nOption A correctly identifies both the approximate interest rate and the exchange rate risk. Options B, C, and D either misstate the interest rate, ignore the exchange rate risk, or introduce risks not mentioned in the provided information."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "796534_2001.txt", "docs_id": "796534", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

In January 2004, the company amended their lease to 7,500 square feet with a monthly payment of $9,290. To calculate the annual cost:\n\n$9,290 per month * 12 months = $111,480 annually\n\nTo compare this to their previous arrangement, we need to look at the lease terms from August 2002 to December 2003, where they paid $16,606 monthly. Annual cost for the previous arrangement:\n\n$16,606 per month * 12 months = $199,272 annually\n\nTo calculate the percentage difference:\n($199,272 - $111,480) / $199,272 = 0.44 or 44%\n\nTherefore, the new arrangement costs approximately 44% less than the previous one. \n\nOption A is correct because it accurately states both the annual cost ($111,480) and the percentage difference (44% less) compared to the previous arrangement."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "815910_1998.txt", "docs_id": "815910", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 2.
