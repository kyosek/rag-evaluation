Additionally, it explicitly states that the Company owns 13,800 square feet of office space in Oak Park, Illinois for its corporate headquarters. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Company does not own all 68 dialysis centers, and it owns (not leases) its corporate headquarters.\n\nAnswer C is close but not entirely accurate. While it's true that the Company leases all regional offices and the majority of dialysis centers, it owns 5 dialysis center facilities, not just leasing all of them.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Company does not lease all dialysis centers (it owns 5), and it does not own all regional offices (the document states that regional offices are leased)."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1045540_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1045540", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
