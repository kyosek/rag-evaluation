Based on the information provided, what is the approximate percentage of the building that the pharmaceutical company retains for its own use, and what potential event could significantly impact their lease arrangement in the near future?\n\nA) 31% of the building; Mendel could terminate the sublease early in 2012\nB) 69% of the building; The main lease expires in 2016\nC) 31% of the building; The main lease expires in 2016\nD) 69% of the building; Mendel could terminate the sublease early in 2012\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The pharmaceutical company leases a 72,000 square foot building and subleases 48,000 + 1,550 = 49,550 square feet to Mendel. This means they retain approximately 22,450 square feet, which is about 31% of the total space (22,450 / 72,000 \u2248 0.31 or 31%). The potential event that could significantly impact their lease arrangement in the near future is Mendel's option to terminate the sublease early on September 1, 2012 for a termination fee of $225,000.
