If the company exercises its option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term, and assuming the monthly rent remains constant at $30,000, what would be the total rent paid for the extension period, taking into account the rent deferrals negotiated in 2008 and 2009?\n\nA) $1,800,000\nB) $1,845,000\nC) $1,881,000\nD) $1,917,000\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe question requires careful analysis of the given information and some assumptions:\n\n1. The lease extension is for 5 years (60 months).\n2. The average monthly rent is $30,000.\n3. Rent deferrals were negotiated for 6 months total:\n   - 3 months at $15,000 each (Nov 2008, Dec 2008, Jan 2009)\n   - 3 months at $12,000 each (Feb, Mar, Apr 2009)\n\nCalculation:\nBase rent for 60 months: 60 * $30,000 = $1,800,000\n\nTotal deferrals: (3 * $15,000) + (3 * $12,000) = $45,000 + $36,000 = $81,000\n\nAssuming the deferrals need to be paid back during the extension period:\nTotal rent for extension = $1,800,000 + $81,000 = $1,845,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) $1,845,000.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "767920_2008.htm", "docs_id": "767920", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.
