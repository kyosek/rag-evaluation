The passage indicates that while the company has been unable to raise the necessary capital to implement its original billboard business plan, it is now engaged in two parallel activities:\n\n1. Searching for other business opportunities that may benefit shareholders and allow the company to raise capital and operate.\n2. Continuing to seek capital to implement its current (original) business plan if the new opportunity does not develop.\n\nThis dual approach is clearly stated in the last sentence: \"If this opportunity does not develop, however, we will continue to both seek new opportunities and look for capital to implement our current business plan.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company hasn't abandoned its original plan entirely.

The Partnership started with an original portfolio of eleven aircraft.\n2. The document states that the Partnership has sold six aircraft and one airframe from its original aircraft portfolio.\n3. Additionally, four aircraft were transferred to aircraft inventory during 1992 and 1993 and were disassembled for sale of their component parts.\n\nSo, let's count:\n- 6 aircraft sold\n- 1 airframe sold (which counts as one aircraft)\n- 4 aircraft disassembled\n\nThis accounts for 11 aircraft (6 + 1 + 4 = 11).\n\nHowever, the question asks about aircraft that remain unsold or not fully disassembled as of December 31, 2001. The document mentions that at this date, the Partnership owned \"certain inventoried parts, which included one engine, out of its original portfolio of eleven aircraft.\"\n\nThis implies that while all aircraft have been either sold or disassembled, parts from at least one of the disassembled aircraft still remain in inventory. Since these parts are from the original portfolio and the aircraft is not fully sold off, we can consider this as one aircraft that is not fully disposed of.\n\nAdditionally, the document doesn't explicitly state what happened to the eleventh aircraft from the original portfolio. Given the careful accounting of sales and disassembly, we can infer that this aircraft also remains in some form of inventory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 2 aircraft from the original portfolio remain unsold or not fully disassembled as of December 31, 2001."}}
