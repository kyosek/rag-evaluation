The documentation states that as of March 9, 1998, the Partnership had sold substantially all of its assets to FHGLP, except for the Somerset System. It specifically mentions that the Partnership's remaining assets related to the Somerset System included its cable plant and converters. Furthermore, the Partnership entered into an agreement with FHGLP to rent the usage of the headend site, office, and related equipment for the Somerset System, which aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Partnership sold its program production and headend equipment to FHGLP, not retained them. Option B is wrong because the Partnership did not sell the Somerset System and did not cease all operations. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of a profit-sharing agreement, and the Partnership did sell most of its assets rather than maintaining ownership of all of them."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1267565_2018.htm", "docs_id": "1267565", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.
