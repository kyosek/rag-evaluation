Calculate the shop floor space: 26,632 - 6,452 = 20,180 sq ft\n2. Calculate the annual rent: $13,865 * 12 = $166,380\n3. Assume the office space costs more per sq ft, let's say 1.5 times the shop floor space cost\n4. Set up an equation: 20,180x + 6,452(1.5x) = 166,380, where x is the annual cost per sq ft of shop floor space\n5. Solve the equation: 20,180x + 9,678x = 166,380\n                       29,858x = 166,380\n                       x = 5.5723 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n6.

It mentions headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina (leased), but also notes administrative offices, maintenance facilities, and network infrastructure across 17 states where they operate Local Exchange Carriers (LECs). \n\nThe company employs redundant power systems, as evidenced by the mention of \"Auxiliary battery or other non-utility power sources\" at each central office. The distributed nature of their network is highlighted by the description of transport and distribution facilities, including fiber optic backbones and copper wire distribution.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company both owns and leases properties, and uses non-utility power sources as backup. Answer B is wrong as the company has a significant presence beyond Charlotte in 17 states.
