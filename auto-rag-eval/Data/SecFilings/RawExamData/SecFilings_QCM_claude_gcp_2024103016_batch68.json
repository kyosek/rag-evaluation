Estimating total leased space:\n   - Houston office: 258,000 sq ft\n   - If this is 25% of total, then total space = 258,000 / 0.25 = 1,032,000 sq ft\n\n2. Calculating rent per square foot:\n   - Annual rent expense: $45.2 million\n   - Rent per square foot = $45,200,000 / 1,032,000 = $43.80 per sq ft per year\n\n3. Adjusting for average lease term:\n   - Average lease term is 4 years\n   - Total rent over lease term = $43.80 * 4 = $175.20 per sq ft\n\n4. The question asks for annual rent, so we divide by 4:\n   $175.20 / 4 = $43.80 per sq ft per year\n\nThe closest answer is $70.24, which is option B.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extrapolate information, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations based on given data."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "804269_2012.htm", "docs_id": "804269", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur executive offices are located at 801 Cherry Street, Suite 3500, Fort Worth, Texas, in a 95,000 square foot office space under a lease that expires in May 2019.\nWe also lease 66,000 square feet of office space in Charlotte, North Carolina under a lease expiring in June 2021, 89,000 square feet of office space in Peterborough, Ontario under a lease expiring in July 2019, 62,000 square feet of office space in Chandler, Arizona under a lease expiring in August 2018 and 250,000 square feet of office space in Arlington, Texas, under a lease expiring in August 2017.
