Calculate 25% of total leased space: 478,877 * 0.25 = 119,719.25 sq ft\n2. Assume this space comes from higher-than-average rate offices, so the savings will be the difference between the highest rate ($22) and the average rate ($10): $22 - $10 = $12 per sq ft\n3. Calculate annual savings: 119,719.25 sq ft * $12 per sq ft = $1,436,631\n\nHowever, the company will still receive income from subleasing at the average rate:\n4.

Winona has the most lines at 15.\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately states the total number of lines (29) and correctly identifies Winona as having the most lines (15).\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it has the correct total (29), it wrongly states Angleton has the most lines.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it overstates the total number of lines.\n\nOption D is incorrect on both counts - the total number of lines and the facility with the most lines."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1067077_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1067077", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
