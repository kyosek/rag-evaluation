The series of transactions described in the documentation suggests a strategy to gain control over the property while assuming minimal financial risk. Here's why:\n\n1. The company initially sold the building and leased it back in 1998, which typically allows a company to free up capital while maintaining use of the property.\n\n2. In 2004, the company purchased all membership interests in TVCA, LLC, which owns the property, for only $10.00.

The company isn't directly liable for the $8.8 million note, but it controls the entity that owns the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication that tax liability was a primary concern.\nOption B is unlikely because purchasing TVCA would add to the balance sheet, not remove assets.\nOption D is not supported by the information given, as there's no mention of a broader real estate strategy."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "1677576_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1677576", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "ITEM 2.

Properties.\nAs of December 31, 2008, we conducted operations through 809 leased facilities and 231 facilities that we own. Our facilities are divided among our reportable segments as follows: North American Physical Business (687), International Physical Business (341) and Worldwide Digital Business (12). These facilities contain a total of 65.4 million square feet of space. Facility rent expense was $197.0 million and $230.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The leased facilities typically have initial lease terms of ten to fifteen years with one or more five year options to extend. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of first refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, with the largest number of facilities in California, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Canada and the U.K. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require that we acquire additional real property either by leasing or purchasing.

This gives us approximately 62,885 sq ft per facility, which rounds to 62,800 sq ft.\n\nThe document states that \"The leased facilities typically have initial lease terms of ten to fifteen years with one or more five year options to extend.\" This matches the lease terms described in option B.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they misstate the typical lease terms.
