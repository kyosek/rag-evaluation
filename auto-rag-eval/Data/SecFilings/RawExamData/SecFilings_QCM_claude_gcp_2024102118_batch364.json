The documentation explicitly states that Grace \"conducts ongoing, long-range forecasting of its capital requirements to assure that additional capacity will be available when and as needed.\" This approach demonstrates a proactive strategy for managing capacity and growth.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text does not mention maintaining excess capacity at all times.
