The passage states that \"These and the Bank's 12 community offices are owned free and clear of any indebtedness. The land on which two of the branch offices is located is leased.\" This directly supports the statement that the bank owns 10 community offices outright and leases the land for 2 branch offices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the bank owns all 12 community offices, it does not own all the land they are built on - it leases the land for two of them.\n\nOption B is speculative and not supported by the information given. While the Spring City Office was sold in 1997, we don't have information about how this affected the overall net book value.\n\nOption C is incorrect.
