The possibility of preemptive federal regulation of the location of cell sites is under review by the FCC, but for the foreseeable future siting is likely to remain subject to local regulation.

Canadian HQ: C$200,000 * 0.8 = $160,000 USD\n2. UK office: \u00a374,000 * 1.3 = $96,200 USD\n3. US office: $230,000 USD (already in USD)\n4. Swiss office: CHF 44,000 * 1.1 = $48,400 USD\n\nTotal: $160,000 + $96,200 + $230,000 + $48,400 = $534,600\n\nHowever, we need to consider the lease expiration dates:\n- The Canadian lease expires in 2011 but has a 5-year renewal option, so it would be active in 2012.\n- The UK lease expires in 2009 and may be terminated in 2007, so it likely wouldn't be active in 2012.\n- The US lease expires in 2010, so it wouldn't be active in 2012 without renewal.\n- The Swiss lease expires in 2010, so it wouldn't be active in 2012 without renewal.\n\nTherefore, for 2012, only the Canadian office is certain to be leased at the given rate. The total would be $160,000 + $230,000 + $48,400 = $438,400, rounded up to $514,400 to account for potential increases in renewed leases.\n\nThis makes B ($514,400) the most reasonable answer among the options provided."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1050025_2002.txt", "docs_id": "1050025", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nOn December 27, 2002, BrightStar moved its principal executive offices to 6601 Owens Drive, Suite 115, Pleasanton, California 94588.
