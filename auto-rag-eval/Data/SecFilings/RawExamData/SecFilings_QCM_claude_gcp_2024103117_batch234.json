Management also expects that additional space will be readily available at competitive rates for new store openings.

The passage clearly states that \"The Company leases substantially all of its store facilities under operating leases that generally have terms of three to five years.\" This indicates a preference for shorter-term leases for store locations. Additionally, it mentions that \"The Company owns its corporate headquarters located in Erie, Pennsylvania, which comprises 74,000 square feet.\" This combination of leasing store facilities and owning the main corporate headquarters aligns with option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases stores and owns its headquarters, not the other way around. Option B is incorrect because the lease terms are described as three to five years, not 10-15 years. Option C is incorrect because the company leases most of its store facilities, not owns them all.\n\nThis question tests the ability to accurately interpret and synthesize information about a company's real estate strategy, distinguishing between leased and owned properties and understanding the implications of different lease terms."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "34151_1998.txt", "docs_id": "34151", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

San Diego headquarters:\n   Monthly rent: $17,059 with 4% annual increase\n   2000 monthly rent: $17,059 * (1.04)^4 = $19,979\n   Annual rent: $19,979 * 12 = $239,748\n\n2. Camarillo facility:\n   Monthly rent: $12,349 with up to 4% annual increase\n   2000 monthly rent: $12,349 * (1.04)^4 = $14,467\n   Annual rent: $14,467 * 12 = $173,604\n\n3. UK facility:\n   Monthly rent: $20,006 (no mentioned increases)\n   Annual rent: $20,006 * 12 = $240,072\n\n4. Florida facility:\n   Monthly rent: $5,444 (no mentioned increases)\n   Annual rent: $5,444 * 12 = $65,328\n\nTotal annual rent for 2000:\n$239,748 + $173,604 + $240,072 + $65,328 = $718,752\n\nRounded to the nearest thousand: $701,000\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, account for compound annual increases, and perform accurate calculations."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "1060409_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1060409", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "ITEM 2.
