For the corporate headquarters in Paramus, NJ:\n   - The annual rent is $550,000 through November 30, 2013.\n   - After this date, the adjacent business suite lease expires.\n   - The document doesn't specify the rent for just the primary lease after this date.\n\n2. For the office space in Niwot, CO:\n   - The leases expire on July 31, 2012.\n   - The annual rent is $145,000 through this date.\n   - There's no information about rent after the expiration if the option to extend is exercised.\n\n3. As of December 1, 2013:\n   - The Niwot, CO leases would have expired (unless renewed, but we have no information on new terms).\n   - The adjacent business suite in Paramus, NJ would have just expired.\n   - Only the primary lease for the corporate headquarters in Paramus, NJ would still be active.\n\n4. Since we don't have specific information about the rent for just the primary lease in Paramus, NJ, we must calculate it:\n   - Total annual rent for both Paramus leases: $550,000\n   - We can assume the adjacent suite is smaller and less expensive.\n   - A reasonable estimate might be that the primary lease accounts for about 75% of the total rent.\n\n5. Calculation: 75% of $550,000 = $412,500\n\nThe closest answer to this estimated amount is $405,000, which is option D.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex lease information, make reasonable assumptions where information is incomplete, and perform calculations based on those analyses."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "925544_2000.txt", "docs_id": "925544", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.

The total cost was $28.1 billion, and the accumulated depreciation was $13.6 billion. Therefore, the net book value is $28.1 billion - $13.6 billion = $14.5 billion.\n\nThis value suggests that the Company has relatively new assets with significant remaining useful life because less than half of the total asset value has been depreciated. If we choose A, it indicates that the Company has been investing in assets over time and maintaining a balance between new and older assets.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it represents the total cost without considering depreciation.

The documentation states that the company \"lease[s] office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\" This approach allows the company to maintain flexibility in its international operations while establishing a presence in key global markets. The company has a mix of longer-term leases for its main offices (like Cambridge, San Francisco, and London) and shorter-term leases for other international locations, suggesting a strategy that balances commitment in key areas with flexibility in emerging markets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company's international leases are described as \"relatively short-term,\" not long-term 10+ year leases.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no mention of the company purchasing office buildings.
