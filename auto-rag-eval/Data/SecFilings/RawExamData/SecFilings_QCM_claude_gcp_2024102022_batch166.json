Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's property holdings?\n\nA) X-Rite owns more square footage than it leases, with approximately 80% of its total space being owned.\nB) The company's largest owned facility is located in Ann Arbor, MI, which houses manufacturing, R&D, and sales operations.\nC) X-Rite's European presence is entirely based on leased properties, with no owned facilities outside the United States.\nD) The company leases more properties than it owns, but the total square footage of owned properties is significantly larger.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, X-Rite and its subsidiaries own approximately 288,000 square feet of space and lease approximately 58,000 square feet. This indicates that while the company leases more individual properties (as evident from the list provided, where most international locations are leased), the total square footage of owned properties (288,000 sq ft) is significantly larger than the leased space (58,000 sq ft).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while X-Rite does own more square footage, the owned space represents about 83% of the total, not 80%.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Ann Arbor, MI facility is listed as leased, not owned. The largest owned facilities appear to be in Grandville, MI and North Sutton, NH.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while many European locations are leased, the statement is too absolute.
