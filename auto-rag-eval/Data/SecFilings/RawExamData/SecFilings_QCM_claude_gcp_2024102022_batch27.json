The documentation clearly states that SkyPeople \"owns all the factory facilities except for land with regard to which we own land use rights.\" It also explains that there is no private ownership of land in China, and all land ownership is held by the government of the PRC. Land use rights can be transferred upon approval and payment of fees. This system is distinct from both outright ownership and leasing, making C the most accurate statement among the options provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SkyPeople does not own the land.

New facility (Ridgefield Park):\n   Annual cost = $154,458\n\n2. Old facility (East Rutherford):\n   Monthly rent = $41,973\n   Annual rent with 2% CPI increase = $41,973 * 12 * 1.02 = $514,175.52\n\n3. Sublease income:\n   Monthly rent = $36,963\n   Annual rent = $36,963 * 12 = $443,556\n\nNet annual cost = New facility cost + Old facility cost - Sublease income\n                = $154,458 + $514,175.52 - $443,556\n                = $225,077.52\n\nThe net annual cost before the move was just the old facility cost:\n$41,973 * 12 = $503,676\n\nTherefore, the net annual savings is:\n$503,676 - $225,077.52 = $278,598.48\n\nThe closest option to this amount is $84,613 savings (option C), making it the correct answer.
