The company has vertically-integrated manufacturing capabilities including plastics-forming and sensor production.\n\nD) UM leases all its facilities and concentrates its advanced packaging and clean room operations in the Redmond, Oregon location.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. UM owns its facilities in Utah (Midvale) and Ireland (Athlone), while leasing the facility in Oregon (Redmond). There is also a mention of a long-term lease on one section of the Midvale parking lot. The documentation describes UM as a vertically-integrated manufacturing company with capabilities including plastics-forming and sensor production, among others. \n\nOption A is incorrect because UM doesn't own all facilities outright (Oregon is leased) and the capabilities at each location are not specified as equivalent. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the ownership status (UM owns in Utah and Ireland, not leases) and there's no specific mention of the R&D lab being in Ireland. \n\nOption D is incorrect because UM doesn't lease all facilities, and there's no indication that advanced packaging and clean room operations are concentrated in Oregon."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "798287_2002.txt", "docs_id": "798287", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.

The main facility in Oldsmar, Florida had a rent expense of $310,970 for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. The smaller office in Miami, Florida has an annual rent of approximately $27,120. To get the total annual rent expense for both properties, we need to add these two figures:\n\n$310,970 + $27,120 = $338,090\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only accounts for the Oldsmar facility's rent in 2017.\nOption B is incorrect as it represents the Oldsmar facility's rent for 2016, not 2017.\nOption D is incorrect; while it's close, it doesn't accurately represent the total rent expense for both properties.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex document, combine data from different sections, and perform accurate calculations."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1181001_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1181001", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.
