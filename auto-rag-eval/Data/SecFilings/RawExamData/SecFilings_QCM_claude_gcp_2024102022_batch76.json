The company moved from a 52,322 square foot facility in Cambridge to a 27,250 square foot facility in Burlington. This represents a reduction of approximately 48% in square footage. Burlington is indeed a suburb of Boston.\n\nB) This is incorrect. The new Burlington facility (27,250 sq ft) was smaller than the previous Cambridge location (52,322 sq ft).\n\nC) This is incorrect. While the new lease in Burlington does have a 5-year renewal option, the initial term is not specified as 5 years. The lease is said to expire on January 31, 2006, which is approximately 5 years from the relocation date, but without knowing the exact start date, we can't confirm it's exactly a 5-year initial term.\n\nD) This is potentially misleading. While the company did move to a smaller facility, which could suggest lower rental expenses, we don't have information about the 2001 rental expenses. The $1.9 million figure given is for 2000, before the relocation. Additionally, rental rates could vary between locations, so a smaller space doesn't necessarily guarantee lower overall expenses."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "936105_1997.txt", "docs_id": "936105", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.
