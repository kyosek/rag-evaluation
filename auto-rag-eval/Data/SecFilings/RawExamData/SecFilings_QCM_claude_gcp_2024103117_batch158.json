The document states that in Michigan and Florida, Comerica Bank operated 290 offices, of which 180 were owned and 110 were leased. In California and Texas, two other banking affiliates operated 114 offices, of which 50 were owned and 64 were leased.\n\nB) This is incorrect. The executive offices were located in the Comerica Tower at Detroit Center, which was leased through Comerica Bank from an unaffiliated third party, not owned by Comerica.\n\nC) This is incorrect. While Comerica owned some operations centers, the document specifically mentions a sale/leaseback agreement for an operations center in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nD) This is incorrect. When totaling the offices across all mentioned U.S. locations (Michigan, Florida, California, and Texas), Comerica operated 230 owned offices (180 + 50) and 174 leased offices (110 + 64).
