The company leases two main facilities in Florida (Fort Lauderdale and Delray Beach) for a monthly aggregate rent of $10,232. Additionally, the systems integration division (Hayes Computer Systems) leases a facility in Tallahassee for $7,500 per month.\n\nTo solve this:\n1.

Calculate the percentage for the systems integration division:\n   ($7,500 / $17,732) * 100 \u2248 42.3%\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately represents both the total monthly rent ($17,732) and the percentage allocated to the systems integration division's facility (42.3%).\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect as they either have the wrong total rent or incorrect percentage calculations."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "70033_2000.txt", "docs_id": "70033", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.

Apartment rental in Cambodia: $1,500 per month * 12 months = $18,000 per year\n\nTotal annual expenses: $0 + $10,000 + $18,000 = $28,000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total assuming all leases and rentals are maintained for a full year. The document mentions a security deposit of $20,000 for the land lease and $4,500 for the apartment rental. While these are one-time payments, we should include them in our calculation as they are property-related expenses that would be incurred in the first year of operations.\n\nTherefore, the total annual property-related expenses for the first year would be:\n$28,000 (recurring expenses) + $20,000 (land lease security deposit) + $4,500 (apartment security deposit) = $52,500\n\nThe closest option to this amount is $38,000 (option C), which makes it the most appropriate answer among the given choices, even though it's not the exact calculated amount."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "898770_2015.htm", "docs_id": "898770", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "ITEM 2.

The documentation describes a complex arrangement where Zhone Technologies purchased the land and buildings in Oakland, but then transferred ownership to a new entity called Zhone Technologies Campus, LLC. Zhone Technologies is the sole member and manager of this LLC, and now leases the property from it. This structure is more complex than a traditional lease (A) or direct ownership (D). It's also not a sale-leaseback with Fremont Bank (B), as Fremont Bank's involvement is limited to holding a deed of trust as part of the financing arrangement.
