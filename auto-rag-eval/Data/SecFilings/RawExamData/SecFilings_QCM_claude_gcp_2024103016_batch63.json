This means that approximately 16% (17/107) of the facilities are leased, while the company owns the rest.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company does not own all 107 facilities; it leases 17 of them.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the facilities are spread across various states in the South, Mid-Atlantic, and some northeastern states, but they are not primarily concentrated in the northeastern U.S.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the executive office is explicitly stated to be located in Newport News, Virginia, not West Virginia.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to carefully analyze numerical information and geographical details provided in the documentation, as well as their attention to specific facts such as the location of the executive office."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1289766_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1289766", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 1.
