What can be inferred about the remaining $3,670,000 of miscellaneous property, and what does this suggest about the bank's operational strategy?\n\nA) It represents investments in new branch locations, indicating an aggressive expansion plan.\nB) It consists of outdated technology equipment, suggesting the bank needs to modernize its operations.\nC) It represents duplicate or excess bank-owned premises, implying potential for cost-cutting through consolidation.\nD) It consists of luxury assets for executive use, indicating potential misuse of company funds.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explicitly states that of the $8,876,000 in miscellaneous property, $5,206,000 is from properties acquired from borrowers, and the remaining $3,670,000 is \"duplicate or excess bank-owned premises.\" This suggests that the bank may have more real estate than it currently needs for its operations, potentially due to branch closures, mergers, or changes in its operational footprint. The presence of excess premises implies that the bank might have an opportunity to reduce costs by consolidating its real estate holdings or selling off unnecessary properties.

Calculating the percentage of leased facilities:\n   - Total facilities: 70\n   - Owned facilities: 12\n   - Leased facilities: 70 - 12 = 58\n   - Percentage of leased facilities: (58 / 70) * 100 = 82.86%\n\n2. Estimating states with multiple facilities:\n   - Total states: 22\n   - Total facilities: 70\n   - Average facilities per state: 70 / 22 = 3.18\n   \n   Since the average is more than 3 facilities per state, and assuming an even distribution, we can estimate that most states would have multiple facilities. A reasonable estimate would be that 10 states have multiple facilities (slightly less than half of the total states).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 82.86% leased, 10 states with multiple facilities.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they either have the wrong percentage of leased facilities or an unreasonable estimate of states with multiple facilities given the information provided."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "866734_2008.htm", "docs_id": "866734", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nEffective February 2008, the Company moved its corporate offices to a leased facility in Boca Raton, Florida.
