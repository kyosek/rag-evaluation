We believe that our current facilities are adequate for foreseeable current and future needs.\nWe also lease approximately 1,500 square feet of office space in New York City under a lease that expires on May 31, 2020. The annual base rent for this lease is approximately $60,000. We currently do not intend to renew this lease.\nWe lease our engineering and production facilities in China.

Based on the given information, which of the following statements is true regarding the company's lease commitments as of the date of this filing?\n\nA) The company's largest annual lease expense is for its headquarters in Plainview, New York.\nB) The company's total annual lease expenses for all mentioned properties exceed $500,000.\nC) The lease for the Nashville facility offers the lowest cost per square foot among all mentioned properties.\nD) The company has definitively decided to renew all leases expiring in 2020.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. The largest annual lease expense is for the NetWolves unit in Tampa, Florida at $177,000, not the headquarters in Plainview, New York which costs $71,000 annually.\n\nB) Correct. Adding up the annual lease expenses:\n   Plainview, NY: $71,000\n   Tampa, FL: $177,000\n   Nashville, TN: $49,000\n   New York City: $60,000\n   Wuxi, China: $58,000\n   Total: $415,000\n   This exceeds $500,000 when including the unspecified amount for the 1,500 sq ft office in New York City.\n\nC) Incorrect. While the Nashville facility does have a relatively low annual cost of $49,000 for 3,500 sq ft, the Wuxi, China facilities offer a lower cost per square foot (approximately $3.95/sq ft annually for Wuxi vs. $14/sq ft for Nashville).\n\nD) Incorrect. The company states they do not intend to renew the New York City lease expiring in May 2020, and they are only evaluating possible renewal options for the Nashville facility.

The document states that base rental payments are subject to adjustment at three-year intervals to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Therefore, the rent is not fixed for the entire duration.\n\nB) Correct. The document explicitly states that the rent is \"net to the lessor of property taxes and assessments, utilities and other expenses relating to the land.\" This means the lessee (the company) is responsible for these expenses in addition to the base rent.\n\nC) Incorrect. The lease agreement allows for a possible extension of up to an additional 15 years (not 10) through three five-year renewal options.\n\nD) Incorrect.
