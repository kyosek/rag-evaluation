Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results. We generally use the words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"likely,\" \"will\" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, including those concerning our expectations, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

The passage clearly states that forward-looking statements \"reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results.\" It also emphasizes that these statements involve risks, uncertainties, and factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. This aligns with option C, which captures both the predictive nature of these statements and the inherent uncertainty associated with them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that forward-looking statements are guarantees or legally binding commitments. In fact, the text implies the opposite by highlighting the potential for discrepancies between expectations and actual results.\n\nOption B is wrong because the passage explicitly states that forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but rather expectations about the future.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the forward-looking statements are made by the company itself, not by competitors or external analysts, as evidenced by the use of \"our\" and \"we\" throughout the text."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1169640_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1169640", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
