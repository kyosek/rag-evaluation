On August 1, 2002, the company abandoned 18,180 square feet of this space, resulting in a $2.1 million facility lease loss charge. Of this charge, $1.8 million relates to base rent and fixed operating expenses through the end of the lease term.

The lease expires in April 2006, so we're dealing with approximately 3 years and 8.5 months (from August 1, 2002 to April 15, 2006).\n2. The total annual commitment is $1.9 million.\n3. The abandoned space is 18,180 sq ft out of 63,548 sq ft, which is about 28.61% of the total space.\n4. Annual cost for abandoned space: $1.9 million * 0.2861 = $543,590\n5. For 3 years and 8.5 months: $543,590 * 3.708 years = $2,015,631\n6. Add the $1.8 million charge for base rent and fixed operating expenses: $2,015,631 + $1,800,000 = $3,815,631\n7. Add the remaining $300,000 from the total facility lease loss charge ($2.1 million - $1.8 million): $3,815,631 + $300,000 = $4,115,631\n\nThe total comes to approximately $4.12 million, which is closest to option C) $6.65 million.
