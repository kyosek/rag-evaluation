The company has both owned and leased properties, with leased properties (2.4 million sq ft) outnumbering owned properties (0.8 million sq ft), showing a preference for leasing but still maintaining ownership of some properties.\n\n2. The document states that they have properties in the United States and 25 other countries, indicating a global presence.\n\n3. The last paragraph mentions that they consider various alternatives for long-term facilities needs and may lease, acquire, or sell additional space to accommodate future business needs. This shows they remain flexible and open to changes based on business requirements.\n\n4. They believe their current properties are adequate for immediate needs but acknowledge potential future changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because they do lease properties and are open to changes. Option B is wrong because owned properties make up about 25% of their total square footage, not less. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of plans to sell all owned properties or transition to a fully leased model."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "110621_2013.htm", "docs_id": "110621", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "Item 2.
