The second building, a five-story, 80,000 square foot facility at One National Data Plaza, was purchased by the company in May 1999, and the company assumed an existing $3.2 million mortgage on this property. Therefore, one building has no debt, while the other has a $3.2 million mortgage, making option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the mortgage on the second building.

The documentation states that Sharps leases space in Houston, initially 119,489 square feet, with an additional 9,368 square feet added in 2015, totaling 128,857 square feet. They own a fully-permitted facility in Carthage, Texas, which is described as an estimated 12,000 square foot building on 4.5 acres of land.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the ownership status of the facilities.\nOption C is incorrect because they lease, not own, the Houston space, and while the Carthage facility can process 100 tons of waste per day, this is not exclusively medical waste.\nOption D is incorrect because it understates the total leased space in Houston and misrepresents the waste treatment capacity in Carthage. The incinerator can treat 40 tons of municipal solid waste per day, with only 10% applicable to medical waste, not 40 tons of medical waste."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1433269_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1433269", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "ITEM 2.
