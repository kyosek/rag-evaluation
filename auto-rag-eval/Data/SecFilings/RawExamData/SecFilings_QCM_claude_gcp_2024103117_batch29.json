Let's break it down:\n\n1. The company's current principal executive offices cost $3,000 per month for approximately 2,500 square feet.\n2. The company has vacated their prior lease in Mesa, Arizona, and is negotiating early cancellation. Therefore, we don't include this cost.\n3.

The MEGAsys offices in Taiwan are not considered the company's principal executive offices, so we don't include their cost.\n\nAdding the current principal executive office rent ($3,000) and the assumed data center hosting fee ($5,000), we get a total of $8,000 per month.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is B) $10,541.
