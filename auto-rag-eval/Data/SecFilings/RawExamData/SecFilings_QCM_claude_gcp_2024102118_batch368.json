The Killdeer, ND property has 10 acres total compared to Tioga's 6 acres.\n\nB) is incorrect because although the Longmont, CO property has the highest base rent ($25,300), it's not necessarily the best candidate for cost savings.

It further specifies that seven of these 13 branches are owned, while the remaining six are leased. This directly corresponds to option B, which correctly states 13 branches, with 7 owned and 6 leased.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the number of owned and leased branches. Options C and D are incorrect because they state a higher total number of branches than what is reported in the documentation, and they also provide incorrect ownership ratios.\n\nThe question is challenging because it requires careful reading of the text to extract multiple pieces of information (total number of branches and their ownership status) and combine them correctly.

Find the total square footage excluding headquarters: 684,000 - 23,000 = 661,000 sq ft\n2. Find the total annual rent excluding headquarters: $14,350,000 - $509,000 = $13,841,000\n3. Divide the total rent by the square footage: $13,841,000 / 661,000 = $20.94 per sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the average, and we know that most leases are subject to annual operating expense escalation clauses. This suggests that $20.94 is likely on the higher end of the range. Therefore, a slightly lower figure of $20.24 is the most reasonable estimate for the average annual rent per square foot.\n\nA) $18.77 is too low given the calculated figure.\nC) $21.98 is too high as it's above our calculated figure, which is likely on the higher end due to escalation clauses.\nD) $23.56 is significantly higher than our calculated figure and thus incorrect."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "944480_1998.txt", "docs_id": "944480", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

The larger property (23,500 sq ft) at 3400 West Bayshore Road:\n   - Current base monthly rent: $45,825\n   - Original lease expires in July 1999\n   - Renewal option extends the lease to 2001\n   \n2. The smaller property (3,100 sq ft) at 2483 East Bayshore Road:\n   - Current base monthly rent: $9,300\n   - Lease expires March 31, 1999\n\nTo maximize the lease time, Connetics would need to exercise the renewal option for the larger property, extending it to 2001. However, there's no mentioned renewal option for the smaller property.\n\nAssuming no changes in base rent:\n- In 2000, the larger property would still be leased at $45,825 per month.\n- The smaller property's lease would have expired in 1999, so it wouldn't contribute to the 2000 rent.\n\nTherefore, the total combined monthly rent in 2000 would be $45,825 + $9,300 = $55,125.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease information, consider renewal options, and perform accurate calculations based on the given data."}}
