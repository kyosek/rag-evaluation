If the company decides to terminate the lease, what is the minimum notice period they must provide, and what is the approximate annual cost per square foot of the leased space (rounded to the nearest cent)?\n\nA) 30 days notice; $6.78 per square foot annually\nB) 90 days notice; $6.78 per square foot annually\nC) 30 days notice; $8.13 per square foot annually\nD) 90 days notice; $8.13 per square foot annually\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, the company must provide 90 days written notice to terminate the lease. To calculate the annual cost per square foot:\n\nMonthly rent: $4,066\nAnnual rent: $4,066 * 12 = $48,792\nSpace: 7,200 square feet\nAnnual cost per square foot: $48,792 / 7,200 = $6.776 per square foot\n\nRounded to the nearest cent, this is $6.78 per square foot annually.
