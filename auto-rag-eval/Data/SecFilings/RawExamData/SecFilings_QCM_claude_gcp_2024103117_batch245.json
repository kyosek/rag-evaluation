The company owned approximately 750,000 square feet of buildings, with an additional 208,000 square feet under construction at the headquarters campus. Adding these together gives 958,000 square feet. Additionally, they leased back 262,500 square feet. The total of owned and leased space is therefore 1,220,500 square feet.\n\nB) While the company did lease back 262,500 square feet, the statement \"exactly\" makes this answer incorrect. The text states \"approximately 262,500 square feet.\"\n\nC) This is incorrect because the 750,000 square feet mentioned refers only to owned buildings. The additional leased facilities are not quantified, so we cannot determine if the total exceeds 750,000 square feet.\n\nD) This is incorrect. The document states that the company believes its current facilities and those under construction are adequate for current needs, but also mentions that \"suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations.\" This implies that they are open to future expansion beyond the current construction."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "22872_2019.htm", "docs_id": "22872", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "ITEM 2.
