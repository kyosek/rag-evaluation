Apply this ratio to the remaining facilities to find the number of owned facilities\n\nStep 1: 70 facilities - 15% = 70 - (70 * 0.15) = 70 - 10.5 = 59.5 facilities\nRound down to 59 facilities as we can't have partial facilities.\n\nStep 2: Current ratio of owned to leased facilities\nOwned: 62\nLeased: 8\nTotal: 70\nRatio = 62:8 = 31:4\n\nStep 3: Apply this ratio to 59 remaining facilities\n31x + 4x = 59\n35x = 59\nx = 59/35 = 1.6857\n\nOwned facilities = 31 * 1.6857 = 52.26\n\nRound up to 53 as we can't have partial facilities.\n\nTherefore, 53 owned facilities would remain operational."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1244824_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1244824", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 2.

The Company has 25 leased dental laboratories.\n2. These laboratories average $49,000 in annual base rent.\n3. The laboratories range in size from 1,000 to 21,000 square feet.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total annual base rent for all leased laboratories:\n25 * $49,000 = $1,225,000\n\nNext, we need to estimate the total square footage of the leased laboratories. Since we don't have the exact size for each lab, we can use the average of the range:\nAverage size = (1,000 + 21,000) / 2 = 11,000 sq ft\n\nTotal estimated square footage = 25 * 11,000 = 275,000 sq ft\n\nFinally, we divide the total annual base rent by the total square footage:\n$1,225,000 / 275,000 sq ft = $4.45 per sq ft\n\nRounding to the nearest cent gives us $3.12 per sq ft.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1103982_2011.htm", "docs_id": "1103982", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.
