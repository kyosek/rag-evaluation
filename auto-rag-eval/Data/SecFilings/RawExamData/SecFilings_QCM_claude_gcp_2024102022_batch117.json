The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states \"The corporate headquarters' lease includes a negotiated annual increase in the monthly rental payments.\" This feature has important accounting implications:\n\n1. Straight-line rent expense: Under GAAP, even with escalating payments, companies typically recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Disclosure requirements: Companies must disclose significant lease terms, including escalation clauses, in their financial statement notes.\n\n4.

The document states 10 hotels are subject to ground leases (5.6% of 179), while 39 are encumbered by mortgage notes (21.8% of 179).\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that none of the 20 management companies are affiliated with the Company.\n\nOption D is correct. The document states that 39 hotels are encumbered by mortgage notes, which is approximately 21.8% of the total 179 hotels.

The passage states, \"It is not certain whether we will negotiate new leases as existing leases expire. These determinations will be based on an assessment of our requirements at that time.\" This indicates that the company will evaluate its needs and make decisions when leases expire, rather than having a predetermined plan.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company explicitly states that it's uncertain whether they will negotiate new leases, contradicting the idea of automatic renewal.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company mentions having renewal options for at least one location and believes it can obtain additional space if necessary, indicating flexibility.\n\nOption C is incorrect as there's no mention of a plan to consolidate operations into a single location.
