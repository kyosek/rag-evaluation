The key points are:\n1. Each line of automation can produce 100,000 kWh annually.\n2. Each line requires 20,000-30,000 square feet of manufacturing space.\n3. The company is installing two lines of automation.\n\nTherefore, with two lines, the maximum production capacity would be 200,000 kWh (100,000 kWh x 2). The space required would be between 40,000-60,000 square feet (20,000-30,000 x 2). The upper end of this range is 60,000 square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it only accounts for one line of automation.\nOption C is incorrect as it underestimates the production capacity and overestimates the space required.\nOption D is incorrect as it overestimates the space required.\nOption B is correct as it accurately represents the maximum production capacity and the approximate space required for two lines of automation."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "918578_2003.htm", "docs_id": "918578", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nThe Company\u2019s headquarters, which includes approximately 20,000 square feet of office space and 60,000 square feet of warehouse space, is located in Boston, Massachusetts The lease expires on December 31, 2011.
