The document explicitly states that the company expects these buildings and land to be adequate for its business purposes through fiscal 2001.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Maxim did acquire property in Oregon, it's not relocating its headquarters there. Option B is wrong because the document states that the company anticipates no difficulty in retaining or replacing its leased properties.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The text states that 1st Source \"sold the building and entered into a leaseback agreement with the purchaser for a term of 30 years,\" indicating that they lease their headquarters building.\n\n2.
