While the lease was renewed in September 2004, it began upon termination of the previous lease in October 2007 and expires in October 2022, which is a 15-year term, but ending in 2022, not 2019.\n\nC) Incorrect. While the company does have offices in multiple cities, the exact count is 13 cities (not 12) across 4 divisions. There's not enough information to determine which division is the largest.\n\nD) Incorrect.
