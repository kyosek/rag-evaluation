Which of the following statements accurately reflects the company's lease situation by the end of 2003?\n\nA) The company had fully settled all its real estate lease obligations worldwide.\nB) The company maintained a large office space in Los Angeles with a long-term lease commitment.\nC) The company had approximately $70,000 of unpaid rent remaining from its previous global leases.\nD) The company had entered into a new 11-month lease agreement for a smaller office space in Los Angeles.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the text, after terminating most of its global leases in 2002, the company entered into an 18-month lease for a 4,675 square foot office in Los Angeles in May 2002. Then, in October 2003, the company entered into a new lease agreement for the same office space, but this time for a term of 11 months. This demonstrates that by the end of 2003, the company had downsized its operations and committed to a shorter-term lease for a smaller office space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text mentions that approximately $70,000 of unpaid rent remained. Option B is incorrect because the new lease was for a relatively small space (4,675 square feet) and a short term (11 months), not a large office with a long-term commitment. Option C, while mentioning the correct amount of unpaid rent, is not the most comprehensive answer about the company's lease situation by the end of 2003."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1261068_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1261068", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.

Calculate the percentage increase\n\nFrom Aug 1, 2013 - Jul 31, 2015, the rate is $4.95 per square foot.\nAnnual rent (2013-2014) = 49,000 sq ft * $4.95 = $242,550\n\nFrom Aug 1, 2010 - Jul 31, 2013, the rate was $4.70 per square foot.\nAnnual rent (2012-2013) = 49,000 sq ft * $4.70 = $230,300\n\nPercentage increase = ($242,550 - $230,300) / $230,300 * 100 = 5.32%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) $242,550; 5.32% increase."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1054102_2000.txt", "docs_id": "1054102", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.
