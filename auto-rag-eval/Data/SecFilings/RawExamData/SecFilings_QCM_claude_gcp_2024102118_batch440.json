Based on the information provided, what is the maximum potential retail square footage the company could have by the end of 2009, assuming they open the maximum number of new stores mentioned, all new stores are the largest size indicated, and no existing stores are closed?\n\nA) 145,000 sq ft\nB) 130,000 sq ft\nC) 85,000 sq ft\nD) 170,000 sq ft\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe question requires several steps of analysis:\n\n1. Current retail square footage at the end of 2007: 25,000 sq ft\n2. Number of stores to be opened in 2008: at least 20\n3. Number of stores to be opened in 2009: approximately 20\n4. Maximum size of new stores: 3,000 sq ft\n\nCalculation:\n25,000 sq ft (existing) + (20 stores \u00d7 3,000 sq ft) + (20 stores \u00d7 3,000 sq ft) = 25,000 + 60,000 + 60,000 = 145,000 sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum potential square footage. Since it states \"at least 20 stores in 2008\" and \"approximately 20 stores in 2009\", we should account for possible additional stores. A reasonable interpretation would be to add a few more stores to the 2009 estimate.\n\nIf we assume 25 stores in 2009 instead of 20, the calculation would be:\n25,000 + (20 \u00d7 3,000) + (25 \u00d7 3,000) = 25,000 + 60,000 + 75,000 = 160,000 sq ft\n\nRounding up to the nearest answer choice gives us 170,000 sq ft, but this exceeds what's reasonably implied by the given information.

The second facility in Perris has approximately 120,000 square feet of covered production space, plus 80,000 square feet as a metal working facility.\n3.

The finishing mill capacity was indeed 1,200,000 tons, and the actual production was 802,800 tons. To calculate the percentage of capacity utilized:\n802,800 / 1,200,000 = 0.669 or 66.9%\n\nFor the other options:\nA) While the melting capacity was 1,200,000 tons, the actual production was 937,900 tons, which is 78.2% of capacity.
