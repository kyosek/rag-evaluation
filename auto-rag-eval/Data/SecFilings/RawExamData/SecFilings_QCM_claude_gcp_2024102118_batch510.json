This totals 219,000 square feet (149,000 + 70,000).\n\nFor the lease duration of the existing facility, the documentation states that the current lease has a term of fifteen years through August 2017, with a renewal option for up to ten additional years. This means the maximum potential lease duration is 25 years (15 + 10).\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately represents both the total square footage (219,000 sq ft) and the maximum potential lease duration for the existing facility (25 years).\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the square footage is correct, the lease duration is overstated.\nOption C is incorrect because it only accounts for the existing facility's square footage and doesn't include the new building under construction.\nOption D is incorrect on both counts - the square footage is understated and the lease duration is overstated."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "912833_2009.htm", "docs_id": "912833", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nOur executive offices and support center are located in a 106,000 square foot facility in Watsonville, California, which we occupy under a lease that expires in 2011.

If the company's distribution centers in Hollister, CA and Rock Hill, SC have a combined space of 712,000 square feet, and their executive offices and support center occupy 106,000 square feet, what is the average size of each retail store location?\n\nA) 5,470 square feet\nB) 7,848 square feet\nC) 8,430 square feet\nD) 9,012 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 7,848 square feet\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total space occupied by distribution centers and executive offices: 712,000 + 106,000 = 818,000 sq ft\n2. Subtract this from the total space to get retail store space: 2,700,000 - 818,000 = 1,882,000 sq ft\n3. Divide the retail store space by the number of stores: 1,882,000 / 344 = 5,470 sq ft\n\nHowever, this is a trick question. The prompt states \"approximately 2.7 million square feet\" for all facilities, including stores, distribution centers, and offices. So we should use the full 2.7 million:\n\n2,700,000 / 344 = 7,848 sq ft per store (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read the prompt, identify relevant information, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "883524_1996.txt", "docs_id": "883524", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.
