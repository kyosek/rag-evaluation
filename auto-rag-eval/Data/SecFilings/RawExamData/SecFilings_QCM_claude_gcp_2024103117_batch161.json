At their Irving, Texas location, they occupy 17,612 square feet with a lease expiring on November 15, 2011. They also lease space in El Paso, Texas. If the company's total leased office space is 34,392 square feet, and their El Paso lease expires on May 31, 2011, what is the square footage of their El Paso location, and what is the status of its previous ownership?\n\nA) 16,780 sq ft; previously owned by an affiliated party until January 2007\nB) 16,780 sq ft; always owned by an unaffiliated third party\nC) 14,309 sq ft; previously owned by an affiliated party until January 2007\nD) 14,309 sq ft; always owned by an unaffiliated third party\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful reading and calculation. The Irving location is stated to be 17,612 sq ft. The total leased space is given as 34,392 sq ft. By subtracting the Irving space from the total, we get 16,780 sq ft for the El Paso location (34,392 - 17,612 = 16,780).

The passage clearly states that the company \"provide[s] contract land drilling services and equipment to oil and natural gas producers in the United States.\" It also mentions that they offer \"drilling rigs,\" \"drilling crews,\" and \"most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs.\" Furthermore, the text indicates that they \"presently focus our operations in selected oil and natural gas production regions in the United States,\" which aligns with the specialized and regionally focused nature described in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does not engage in exploration, production, or marketing of oil and gas products. Option B is too broad, as the company focuses specifically on drilling services rather than offering a wide range of oilfield services. Option D is incorrect because the company operates the drilling rigs rather than manufacturing and selling them to other operators."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "929061_1996.txt", "docs_id": "929061", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "Item 2.
