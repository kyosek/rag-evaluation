What potential concern does this arrangement raise, and what additional information would be most relevant to assess this situation?\n\nA) Conflict of interest; The exact percentage of ownership each officer, director, and shareholder has in the partnership\nB) Tax evasion; The total revenue generated by each leased office location\nC) Antitrust issues; The market share of the company in each location where it has an office\nD) Inefficient use of capital; The comparative costs of leasing vs. owning office space in each location\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A) Conflict of interest; The exact percentage of ownership each officer, director, and shareholder has in the partnership.\n\nThe arrangement described in the SEC filing raises potential conflict of interest concerns. When officers, directors, and shareholders of a company are also limited partners in a partnership that owns the company's principal executive office, there's a risk that these individuals could benefit personally from the company's real estate decisions.\n\nKnowing the exact percentage of ownership each officer, director, and shareholder has in the partnership would be most relevant to assess the situation. This information would help determine the extent of the potential conflict and whether any individuals stand to gain significantly from the arrangement.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no indication of tax evasion, and revenue from each office is not directly relevant to the conflict of interest issue.\n\nOption C is incorrect because antitrust issues are not implied by the given information, and market share is not pertinent to the described arrangement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while efficient use of capital is important, it's not the primary concern raised by the described situation.

Original space (17,600 sq ft):\n   The initial rent was $141,000 per year for the first two years (2004-2006), with escalation thereafter. Although we don't have the exact escalation rate, we can assume it has increased somewhat by 2010.\n\n2. Additional space (9,600 sq ft):\n   The lease amendment states that there will be annual increases after July 31, 2009, up to a maximum of $13,176 per month for the additional space.\n\nCalculation:\n- Original space (estimated): $141,000 + some escalation, let's estimate conservatively at $150,000 per year\n- Additional space (at maximum rate): $13,176 x 12 months = $158,112 per year\n\nTotal: $150,000 + $158,112 = $308,112\n\nThe closest option to this calculation is $414,112, which allows for further escalation of the original space rent that we couldn't precisely calculate from the given information.\n\nOptions A and B are too low to account for both spaces, while D is likely too high even with maximum escalation."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "885639_2018.htm", "docs_id": "885639", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "Item 2.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The text states: \"Approximately one-fourth of the leases provide for additional rent based on a percentage of sales over designated levels.\" This corresponds to about 25% of leases.\n\n2. Regarding distribution centers, the text mentions: \"We own all of the distribution centers except Corsicana, Texas, which is leased.\" This indicates that Kohl's owns most of its distribution centers, with only one exception.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they misstate either the lease percentage or the distribution center ownership. Option D is incorrect on both counts, making it a plausible distractor for those who didn't read the passage carefully."}}
