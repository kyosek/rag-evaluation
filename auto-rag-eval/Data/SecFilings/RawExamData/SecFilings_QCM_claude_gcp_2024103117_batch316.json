What percentage of the office floor space is currently occupied by Oriental's operations and outside tenants combined?\n\nA) 84%\nB) 87%\nC) 97%\nD) 100%\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 87%\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that Oriental's centralized units and subsidiaries occupy approximately 84% of the office floor space. Additionally, approximately 3% of the office space is leased to outside tenants. Together, these sum up to 87% occupancy (84% + 3% = 87%). The remaining 13% is available for lease, which accounts for the full 100% of the building's office space.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret numerical information, combine relevant data points, and calculate percentages.
