The company has already closed the San Diego facility in July 2001 but is still paying for the lease due to inability to find a sublessee. Successfully subletting this property would immediately reduce expenses by eliminating the need to pay for an unused facility. The company has already recorded a loss for all contractual lease payments through March 2004, so any sublease income would directly improve their financial situation.\n\nC) Incorrect. Developing the 20 acres of adjacent property would likely require significant capital investment and time, and would not result in immediate cost savings.

The current monthly lease rate is $65,000. If the company exercises both of its remaining 5-year extension options and extends the lease until 2031, what would be the approximate monthly lease rate in the final year of the extended term?\n\nA) $78,650\nB) $86,515\nC) $71,500\nD) $95,166\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires multiple steps of analysis:\n\n1. The original lease was extended until 2021.\n2. There are two 5-year extension options remaining.\n3. Each extension increases the base rent by 10%.\n\nIf both extensions are exercised, the lease would run until 2031 (2021 + 5 + 5).\n\nThe rent increases would compound:\n- First extension (2026): $65,000 * 1.10 = $71,500\n- Second extension (2031): $71,500 * 1.10 = $78,650\n\nHowever, the question asks for the rate in the final year of the extended term. Since the 10% increase applies at the beginning of each 5-year extension, we need to calculate one more 10% increase:\n\n$78,650 * 1.10 = $86,515\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) $86,515."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1653821_2019.htm", "docs_id": "1653821", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nCEN has one facility in Lakeshore, Ontario. 20 North Rear Road is a 10.4 acre site of land that was subleased from Creative.
