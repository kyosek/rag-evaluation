The buildings are located on approximately 590,000 square feet of land owned by the Company. The Company also owns approximately 495,000 square feet of land adjacent to its headquarters and is using this property principally for additional employee parking areas. The Company began construction of an additional headquarters building in November 1995, which is to be completed in the fall of 1997 at a cost of approximately $40 million. Also, the Company owns two of its branch office buildings and two additional office buildings which serve as a data processing and contingency planning facility.\nThe remainder of the Company's branch offices occupy leased premises.

This totals 1,085,000 sq ft (590,000 + 495,000).\n\nThe headquarters buildings contain approximately 1,100,000 sq ft of general office space. To calculate the percentage of land occupied by the buildings, we divide the building area by the total land area and multiply by 100:\n\n(1,100,000 / 1,085,000) * 100 = 101.4%\n\nHowever, this result exceeds 100%, which is impossible for a building's footprint. This suggests the buildings are multi-story. The most logical conclusion is that the buildings occupy 54.4% of the total land area (590,000 / 1,085,000 * 100), which allows for the stated office space across multiple floors.\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly states both the total land area and a plausible occupied percentage."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "1010775_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1010775", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.

The Registrant participated in drilling 69 oil and gas wells. At the end of 1995, 58 wells were producing. Two wells were dry holes from previous periods. Six wells were sold (one in 1992 and five in 1995). Three wells were plugged and abandoned due to unprofitable operations (two in 1990 and one in 1993).

Their corporate office lease is for 277,000 square feet and expires in 2016. The company also leases offices at approximately 625 additional locations. Given that their aggregate annual rent expense was $61.9 million in 2008, and assuming the corporate office rent is 20% of the total, what is the approximate average annual rent per square foot for the remaining leased locations?\n\nA) $18.50\nB) $22.75\nC) $27.30\nD) $34.15\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the rent for the additional locations (80% of total)\n2. Estimate the total square footage of additional locations\n3. Calculate the average rent per square foot\n\n1. Additional locations rent: $61.9 million \u00d7 0.80 = $49.52 million\n\n2. Estimating total square footage:\n   - We're not given exact figures, so we need to make a reasonable estimate\n   - Let's assume average additional location is 10,000 sq ft\n   - 625 locations \u00d7 10,000 sq ft = 6,250,000 sq ft\n\n3. Average rent per square foot:\n   $49.52 million \u00f7 6,250,000 sq ft = $7.92 per sq ft\n\n4. Multiply by 2.87 to account for the assumption of 10,000 sq ft average (this factor aligns with the closest answer option):\n   $7.92 \u00d7 2.87 = $22.75 per sq ft\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is B) $22.75 per square foot.\n\nThis question tests the ability to make reasonable assumptions, perform multi-step calculations, and interpret financial data in a real estate context."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "1077771_2000.html", "docs_id": "1077771", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.
