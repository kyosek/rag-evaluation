The key information is that the company purchased \"approximately 64 acres of land adjacent to our property for a total purchase price of approximately $646,000.\" To find the cost per acre, we need to divide the total purchase price by the number of acres:\n\n$646,000 / 64 acres \u2248 $10,094 per acre\n\nThis matches option B. \n\nOption A is too low, likely from misplacing the decimal point. \nOption C is too high, possibly from multiplying instead of dividing. \nOption D is unrealistically high for farmland, showing a misunderstanding of land prices or a calculation error.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a longer text, perform a calculation, and select the most appropriate answer among similar-looking options."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "789790_1995.txt", "docs_id": "789790", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "ITEM 2.
