The documentation states that Car.com currently occupies approximately 22,000 square feet, with the lease expiring in June 2005. It then mentions that they have entered into a new lease for 5,500 square feet, effective from July 2005.\n\nTo calculate the percentage reduction:\n1. Original space: 22,000 sq ft\n2. New space: 5,500 sq ft\n3. Reduction: 22,000 - 5,500 = 16,500 sq ft\n4. Percentage reduction: (16,500 / 22,000) * 100 = 75%\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a dense text, perform calculations, and express the result as a percentage.
