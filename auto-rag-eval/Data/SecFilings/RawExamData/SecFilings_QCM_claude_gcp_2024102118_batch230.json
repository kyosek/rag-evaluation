It then transitioned to forming and distributing developmental stage companies. However, the current description states that FHS is \"inactive in the formation of subsidiaries\" and has \"no activities other than investment portfolio management at this time.\" The document also explicitly mentions that FHS has no employees and is \"seeking a merger or business combination for itself.\" This aligns perfectly with option C, which describes FHS as an inactive company managing its investments and looking for potential business combinations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because FHS stopped providing business services to medical professionals in 1987.

Properties\nFrom January 1, 2006 through December 1, 2006, we maintained our executive offices c/o Schwartz & Weiss, P.C. at 457 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022. The cost for this space and other additional services provided by the law firm of Schwartz & Weiss, P.C. was $7,500 per month. On December 19, 2006, we entered into a sublease with Blue Diamond Realty, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Effective as of December 1, 2006, Blue Diamond Realty LLC agreed to sublet offices to the Company located at 103 Foulk Road, Wilmington, Delaware, and provide the Company with such office space and equipment, including a conference room, as well as administrative support necessary for the Company\u2019s business. The sublease is for thirteen months effective December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007, with an automatic renewal each year for an additional one year period, unless either party gives the other party at least 90 days written notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement.

From January 1, 2006 to November 30, 2006 (11 months):\n   The company paid $7,500 per month to Schwartz & Weiss, P.C.\n   11 months \u00d7 $7,500 = $82,500\n\n2. For December 2006:\n   The company moved to the new location subleased from Blue Diamond Realty, LLC.\n   The annual cost for this space is $4,000, so for one month it would be $4,000 \u00f7 12 = $333.33\n\n3. Total for 2006:\n   $82,500 + $333.33 = $92,833.33\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total amount paid, and the new sublease was effective from December 1, 2006. This means the company likely paid for both locations in December:\n   $92,833.33 + $7,500 (for December at the old location) = $100,333.33\n\nRounding to the nearest option given, $93,500 is the closest amount, making D the correct answer.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, calculate prorated amounts, and consider overlapping payments during a transition period."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1060801_2000.txt", "docs_id": "1060801", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

The passage mentions that Old Republic owns three major office buildings (in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Blue Bell) and \"Eight smaller buildings... in various parts of the nation,\" which totals 11 owned buildings. The carrying value of all owned buildings and related land is explicitly stated as $58.5 million as of December 31, 2011.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all buildings are fully occupied by the company; some space is leased to others.\nOption B is incorrect because the Chicago office is only 52% occupied by Old Republic, not 100%.\nOption D is incorrect because while both buildings have 110,000 square feet, their occupancy rates differ (73% for Minneapolis and 100% for Blue Bell)."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1056358_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1056358", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 8.
