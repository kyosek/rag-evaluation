The document states that \"Pharmacy lease terms vary from less than one year up to approximately ten years, and average approximately five years. Leased areas average approximately 4,500 square feet.\" This directly supports the statement in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company leases most locations and only owns \"an interest\" in a few specific pharmacies. The average lease term is 5 years, not 10.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the main Corporate Office in Chatsworth is leased, not owned. The lease commenced in 1987, but this doesn't mean the Company owns it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the secondary Corporate Office in Norcross is on a 3-year sublease, not a 10-year lease with renewal options.

While the company has offices in Japan and India, there's no specific mention of focusing expansion efforts in Asia.\n\nOption B is incorrect because although Fremont, California is mentioned as a principal facility, there's no indication that expanding manufacturing capabilities there is a priority.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the expiration of leases does not necessarily imply that the company won't expand.

The documentation states that the building area is approximately 240,000 square feet, which is 51% utilized by the Company. This indicates that the company is using just over half of the available space, leaving significant room for potential expansion or the possibility of leasing out additional space to more tenants.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company is not fully utilizing the facility; it's only using 51% of the space.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the new facility is described as being approximately five times larger than the company's previous facility in Brooklyn, not the same size.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation only mentions this single property in Harrison, New Jersey, and does not indicate that the company owns multiple properties.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the company's current space utilization and potential for future growth within their existing property."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "105608_2012.htm", "docs_id": "105608", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 8.
