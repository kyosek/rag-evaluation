Based on the information provided, which of the following locations would be the most suitable option, considering the space requirements and lease expiration dates?\n\nA) Needham, Massachusetts - 38,000 square foot office\nB) Los Gatos, California - 33,000 square foot office\nC) Salem, New Hampshire - 26,000 square foot facility\nD) Needham, Massachusetts - 31,000 square foot manufacturing facility\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe most suitable option for consolidating engineering, sales, and marketing functions is the Los Gatos, California office. Here's why:\n\n1. Space: The Los Gatos office is approximately 33,000 square feet, which is large enough to accommodate multiple departments.\n\n2. Functions: The document specifically states that this office is used for \"engineering, sales, marketing and administration,\" which matches the company's consolidation goals.\n\n3. Lease expiration: The lease for this facility expires in 2006, giving the company more time before needing to renew or relocate.\n\n4. Single location: Unlike the Needham options, which are spread across multiple facilities, the Los Gatos office is a single location, making it ideal for consolidation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's part of multiple facilities in Needham and may not be sufficient on its own. Option C is too small and its lease expires sooner (2003). Option D is a manufacturing facility and not suitable for the required functions."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1405495_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1405495", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "Item 2.\nPROPERTIES.\nWe own, subject to a mortgage, our corporate headquarters, which is located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and consists of approximately 52,000 square feet of administrative office and research space.
