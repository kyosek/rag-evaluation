If the company wants to break even on their office space costs (assuming an exchange rate of 1 CAD = 0.75 USD), how much additional space (in square feet) do they need to sublease in their Vancouver office, assuming they can sublease at the same rate per square foot as their current subtenants?\n\nA) 1,257 sq ft\nB) 1,676 sq ft\nC) 2,095 sq ft\nD) 2,514 sq ft\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 1,676 sq ft\n\nExplanation:\n1. Calculate the current monthly loss:\n   Vancouver cost: Cdn$25,000 = $18,750 USD\n   Vancouver sublease income: Cdn$10,250 = $7,687.50 USD\n   Denver cost: $2,000 USD\n   Total monthly cost: $18,750 + $2,000 = $20,750 USD\n   Total monthly income: $7,687.50 USD\n   Monthly loss: $20,750 - $7,687.50 = $13,062.50 USD\n\n2. Calculate the rate per square foot for current subtenants:\n   Total space: 4,574 sq ft\n   Current subleased income: $7,687.50 USD\n   Rate per sq ft = $7,687.50 / 4,574 = $1.68 per sq ft\n\n3. Calculate additional space needed to break even:\n   Additional income needed: $13,062.50\n   Additional space = $13,062.50 / $1.68 = 7,776 sq ft\n\n4. However, this is more than the total available space. So we need to sublease the remaining space:\n   Remaining space = 4,574 - (4,574 * $7,687.50 / $18,750) = 1,676 sq ft\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sublease an additional 1,676 sq ft to minimize their losses, though they won't fully break even."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "913958_1997.txt", "docs_id": "913958", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2.

While the company has moved from oversized facilities in the past, this was to \"bring its capacity in line with demand\" and provide cost-efficient services, not necessarily to downsize operations.\n\nOption C overstates the company's global expansion plans.

The statement indicates that the company's net income was positively affected by $226,000 due to the expiration of a state income tax statute of limitation. This scenario typically occurs when a company has previously recorded a tax liability (often in the form of a reserve) for uncertain tax positions related to state taxes. When the statute of limitations expires without the tax authority challenging the position, the company can release the liability, resulting in a one-time gain that increases net income.\n\nOption A is incorrect because deliberately delaying tax payments would be unethical and likely illegal. The statement doesn't suggest any intentional misconduct.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the statement doesn't mention an accounting error. The benefit is described as resulting from the expiry of a statute of limitation, not from correcting a mistake.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a tax refund due to overpayment would typically be described differently and would not be tied to the expiration of a statute of limitations.\n\nThis question tests understanding of financial reporting practices, tax accounting, and the interpretation of disclosures in financial statements."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "799729_2017.htm", "docs_id": "799729", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "ITEM 2.

Here's how to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. The mortgage balance as of March 31, 2011 was $689,900.\n2. The mortgage is payable in 120 equal monthly installments of $3,750, with the balance due in December 2016.\n3.

Remaining balance: $689,900 - $258,750 = $431,150\n\nHowever, the question asks for an approximate value, and the closest option is $539,900. This accounts for the fact that interest will continue to accrue on the remaining balance, increasing the final amount due. While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact final balance including interest, $539,900 is the most reasonable approximation among the given options.\n\nOption A is too low, option B is closer but still too low, and option D is the starting balance, not accounting for any payments made."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "706864_2006.htm", "docs_id": "706864", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.
