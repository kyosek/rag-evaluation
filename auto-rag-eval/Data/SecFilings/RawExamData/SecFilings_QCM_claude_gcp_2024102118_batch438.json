This translates to about 2.25 million square feet being owned (75% of 3.0 million), with the balance being leased.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company doesn't own all facilities; about 25% are leased. Option B is wrong because it reverses the ownership status - most manufacturing spaces are owned, while sales offices are mostly leased.

The company likely chose a capital lease for the manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio to take advantage of tax benefits associated with capital leases. Capital leases are treated similarly to owned assets for accounting purposes, allowing the company to depreciate the asset and deduct interest expenses, which can provide significant tax advantages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while avoiding upfront costs can be a benefit of leasing, it doesn't explain why they specifically chose a capital lease over an operating lease.\n\nOption C is incorrect because capital leases typically offer less flexibility compared to operating leases, as they are more akin to ownership.\n\nOption D is incorrect because capital leases are required to be recorded on the balance sheet, unlike operating leases (prior to recent accounting standard changes).

Based on the information provided, what is the total annual rent expense for all mentioned facilities, and which location accounts for the largest portion of this expense?\n\nA) Total annual rent: $700,000; New York office accounts for the largest portion\nB) Total annual rent: $800,000; Israel facilities account for the largest portion\nC) Total annual rent: $900,000; New York office accounts for the largest portion\nD) Total annual rent: $800,000; New York office accounts for the largest portion\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The total annual rent expense can be calculated by adding the rent for the U.S. executive offices ($100,000 per year) and the rent for the Israel facilities (approximately $700,000 per year). This totals $800,000 annually. The Israel facilities account for the largest portion of this expense at $700,000, which is significantly more than the $100,000 for the New York office. Option B is therefore correct, as it accurately states both the total annual rent ($800,000) and identifies that the Israel facilities account for the largest portion of this expense."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "1041657_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1041657", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "ITEM 2.
