Those facilities were owned and operated by Ms. Janet Moore (an officer and director of the Company), Ilse Sultanian, Susan Irani Rigdon and Jennifer Irani, some of whom are shareholders.

If the company had continued leasing from related parties at the previous rate of $14,000 per month, the expense for 24 months would have been $14,000 * 24 = $336,000. The difference is $468,775 - $336,000 = $132,775, with the new lease being more expensive.

We know the total rental expense for all facilities ($8,880,000) and the expense for sales and service offices ($6,778,000). The difference, $2,102,000, must account for the principal executive office and any other facilities not categorized as sales and service offices.\n\nGiven that the principal executive office is owned by a partnership in which several of the company's officers, directors, and shareholders are limited partners (as mentioned in the text), it's likely that the company receives favorable terms for this space. The relatively small difference between total expenses and sales/service office expenses, despite the large size of the principal office (34,000 sq ft), suggests that the company is paying below-market rent for this space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because market rate rent for such a large office would likely result in a larger difference between total expenses and sales/service office expenses.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is still a significant amount ($2,102,000) unaccounted for by sales and service offices, suggesting some payment for the principal office.\n\nOption D is too specific and unsupported by the given information.\n\nTherefore, the most logical inference is option C, that the company pays below-market rent for its principal executive office to City Square Limited Partnership."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "1165231_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1165231", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.
