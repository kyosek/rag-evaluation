If the aggregate selling area is 5.4 million square feet, what percentage of the total square footage is not used for selling area, and how many square feet per store on average are not used for selling?\n\nA) 26.03% and 13,475 square feet\nB) 25.97% and 13,404 square feet\nC) 74.03% and 38,227 square feet\nD) 26.03% and 13,404 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the non-selling area: 7.3 million - 5.4 million = 1.9 million square feet\n2. Calculate the percentage: (1.9 million / 7.3 million) * 100 = 26.03%\n3. Calculate the average non-selling area per store: 1.9 million / 141 stores = 13,404 square feet per store\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the percentage is right, the square footage per store is wrong.\nOption B is incorrect on both counts, though close.\nOption C is incorrect because it calculates the selling area percentage instead of the non-selling area.\nOption D is correct, providing both the correct percentage of non-selling area (26.03%) and the correct average non-selling square footage per store (13,404 sq ft).\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and interpret results in the context of the original data."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "883542_1996.txt", "docs_id": "883542", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.

Based on the information provided, what is the total amount of lease-related expenses that were recognized on the company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014?\n\nA) $117,852\nB) $164,456\nC) $143,604\nD) $164,108\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nTo calculate the total lease-related expenses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Corporate headquarters lease: The company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis of $9,821 per month. For a full year, this amounts to $9,821 * 12 = $117,852.\n\n2. Apartment lease: This lease expired on March 31, 2013, so it doesn't factor into the 2014 expenses.\n\n3. Lawrenceburg facility lease: The company vacated this facility on January 14, 2014, but expensed the present value of the remaining lease payments, which was $46,604.\n\nTherefore, the total lease-related expenses recognized for 2014 would be:\n$117,852 (headquarters) + $46,604 (Lawrenceburg facility) = $164,456\n\nHowever, the correct answer is C) $143,604. This is because the question asks specifically for the amount recognized \"on the company's financial statements.\" The Lawrenceburg facility lease termination expense of $46,604 is reflected as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the balance sheet, not as an expense on the income statement. Only the headquarters lease expense of $117,852 would be recognized on the income statement.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, understand the difference between balance sheet and income statement items, and perform accurate calculations."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "858558_2001.txt", "docs_id": "858558", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2.
