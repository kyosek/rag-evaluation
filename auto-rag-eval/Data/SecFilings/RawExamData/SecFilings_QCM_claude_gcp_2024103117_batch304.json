The 85,000 square foot facility in Shelton, Connecticut is indeed the largest leased space mentioned, and its lease, which commenced in June 1991 for a ten-year term, would indeed expire in June 2001.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the executive office lease in Shelton does expire on September 1, 2001, it is not the longest-standing lease (the warehouse lease from 1991 is older).\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the Toronto lease does expire on December 31, 2000, it's not the smallest leased space (the Switzerland space is smaller at 7,000 square feet).\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Switzerland lease is the smallest, it's not necessarily the most recently acquired (the document doesn't specify when all leases were initially acquired, only when they commenced)."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "77776_2005.htm", "docs_id": "77776", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nOur principal offices are located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt.
