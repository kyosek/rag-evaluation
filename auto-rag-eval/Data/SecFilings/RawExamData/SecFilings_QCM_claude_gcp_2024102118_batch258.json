The Little Elm facility produced 21.6% of total units in 2016.\n2. The company used 18.0% of its total U.S. productive capacity in 2016.\n3. If 18.0% of capacity produced 21.6% of units, we can set up a proportion:\n   18.0% capacity : 21.6% production\n4. To find what 100% capacity represents, we divide 21.6 by 0.18:\n   21.6 / 0.18 = 120\n5. This means the Little Elm facility represents 120% of the company's total U.S. productive capacity.\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires multiple steps of reasoning and the ability to recognize that the Little Elm facility's capacity exceeds 100% of the company's current U.S. productive capacity, suggesting that the company has more potential production capacity than it's currently utilizing."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "921114_2006.htm", "docs_id": "921114", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 1.
