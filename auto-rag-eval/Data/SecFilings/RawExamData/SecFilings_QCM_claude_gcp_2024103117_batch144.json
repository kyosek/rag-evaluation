By 2003, the leases for Beaverton, Sunnyvale, and Ann Arbor would have already expired, meaning the company would likely be on month-to-month terms or would have already renegotiated. The Pleasanton facility, with its lease extending to 2007, would be the only location still under its original long-term lease.
