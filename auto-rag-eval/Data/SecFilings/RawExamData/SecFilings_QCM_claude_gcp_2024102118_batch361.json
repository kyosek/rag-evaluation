Calculate the total U.S.-based space\n2. Determine how much U.S. space is owned\n3. Calculate the leased U.S. space\n4. Find the percentage of U.S. space that is leased\n\nStep 1: Total U.S. space = 54% of 3,207,000 = 1,726,000 sq ft\n\nStep 2: Assuming all owned space is in the U.S. (worst case for leased percentage):\nU.S. owned space = 1,154,000 sq ft\n\nStep 3: U.S. leased space = 1,726,000 - 1,154,000 = 572,000 sq ft\n\nStep 4: Percentage of U.S. space leased = (572,000 / 1,726,000) * 100 = 33.14%\n\nTherefore, 68.7% of U.S.-based space is leased.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret data, make assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1092796_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1092796", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.
