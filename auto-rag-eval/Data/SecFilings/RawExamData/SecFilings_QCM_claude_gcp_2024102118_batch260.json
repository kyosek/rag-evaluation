Fuller, III and has since expanded to operate railroads in six different countries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. has completed 24 acquisitions since 1977 when Mortimer B. Fuller, III purchased a controlling interest. The company now operates over approximately 8,100 miles of owned, jointly owned, or leased track, as well as more than 3,000 additional miles under track access arrangements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company operates 8,100 miles of owned track, not 14,000, and it's stated to be the second-largest, not the largest, regional railroad operator in North America.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the company is described as the second-largest operator of regional railroads in North America, not the third. Additionally, it has a 50% ownership stake in the Australian Railroad Group, which is the second-largest privately owned rail business in Australia, not 75% of the largest.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the company was founded in 1899, not 1977. 1977 was the year Mortimer B. Fuller, III purchased a controlling interest. Also, the documentation only mentions operations in five countries (United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Bolivia), not six."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "740582_1994.txt", "docs_id": "740582", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1994", "text": "Item 8.

To calculate the maximum potential lease duration, we need to use the upper limits of both ranges:\n\nInitial term: 25 years\nMaximum number of renewal options: 8\nDuration of each renewal option: 5 years\n\nTotal maximum duration = Initial term + (Number of renewal options \u00d7 Duration of each option)\n= 25 + (8 \u00d7 5)\n= 25 + 40\n= 65 years\n\nTherefore, the maximum potential lease duration for a typical Kohl's store, assuming all renewal options are exercised, is 65 years."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1057058_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1057058", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
