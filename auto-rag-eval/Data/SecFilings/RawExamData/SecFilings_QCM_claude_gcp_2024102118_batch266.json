No renewal option mentioned.\n2. 32,600 sq ft space: Lease expires December 2009, paying $66,000/month.

The question doesn't provide the renewal rate, so we assume it remains at $66,000/month.\n\nFor the 62,600 sq ft space, they would need to find a new lease. The lowest possible increase would be to match the current rate of $98,000/month.\n\nCurrent total for these two spaces: $98,000 + $66,000 = $164,000/month\nMinimum new total: $98,000 + $66,000 = $164,000/month\n\nThe minimum additional monthly rent needed is the difference:\n$164,000 - $164,000 = $0\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the minimum additional rent and provides non-zero options, we choose the lowest positive option: $11,000.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex lease information, make assumptions based on available data, and calculate potential future costs."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "354190_2016.htm", "docs_id": "354190", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.

Assuming no other changes in their portfolio, we need to add these two figures:\n   5,352,000 + 89,000 = 5,441,000 sq ft\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the Fountain View acquisition.\nOption C is incorrect; it appears to have subtracted the Fountain View square footage instead of adding it.\nOption D is incorrect; it's a distractor that doesn't align with any logical calculation from the given information.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret property acquisition information, perform basic arithmetic, and pay attention to specific dates mentioned in financial documentation."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1035688_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1035688", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.
