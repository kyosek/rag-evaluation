The documentation clearly states that AFS Funding Corp. and AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2001-C are bankruptcy-remote entities. Their purpose is specifically to acquire motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts, securitize these contracts through the issuance of debt securities (Notes), and isolate these assets from potential bankruptcy proceedings.

This structure facilitates the securitization process while protecting the assets from potential bankruptcy risks associated with the parent company or other entities.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because these entities are not independent and do not engage in diverse business activities.

PROPERTIES Rio Blanco Properties - On December 17, 1987, The Oil Shale Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tosco Corporation exercised the Purchase Option on the Rio Blanco Properties. Details of the transaction are as described in the discussion of the Asphalt Feasibility Program. Pilot Plant Lease - On October 15, 1982, Paraho Development leased 200 acres of private land near Rifle, Colorado from an individual for an initial term of ten years with provisions for extensions. The leased land provides a location for the Company to operate its pilot oil shale retort facility, and management considers the land to be adequate space to enable New Paraho to carry out research operations. As renegotiated on October 8, 1992, the lease calls for an annual minimum rent of $6,000 and an operational rate of $28,296 per year. The new lease expires in October, 2002. The rent for the land at the operational rate for the twelve months ended June 30, 1996 was prorated on a daily basis.

If the company currently leases 70,000 sq ft to outside parties, what percentage of the total property does the company use for its own operations, and what was the approximate gain realized from selling its subsidiary's facilities in Ferris, Texas?\n\nA) 50% of the property is used by the company; $324,000 gain from the Texas sale\nB) 50% of the property is used by the company; $93,250 gain from the Texas sale\nC) 70% of the property is used by the company; $324,000 gain from the Texas sale\nD) 70% of the property is used by the company; $93,250 gain from the Texas sale\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The company uses 50% of the West New York property for its own operations. This can be calculated as follows: Total property size is 140,000 sq ft, and 70,000 sq ft is leased to outside parties. Therefore, the company uses the remaining 70,000 sq ft, which is 50% of the total.\n\nThe gain realized from selling the subsidiary's facilities in Ferris, Texas was explicitly stated as $324,000 pretax.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it has the wrong gain amount.
