The passage indicates that the company is relocating due to a significant rent increase (over 50%) at their current location.

Malaysian property: $387,000\n\nTotal: $182,700 + $533,000 + $387,000 = $1,102,700\n\nHowever, the correct answer is $1,094,900 because the question specifies \"assuming the company recovered the full 30% grant on the Irish property.\" This means we should subtract 30% of the original price, not 30% of the U.S. dollar equivalent:\n\nIrish property adjusted: $261,000 - (30% of 270,000 Irish Pounds)\n270,000 * 0.3 = 81,000 Irish Pounds\n81,000 Irish Pounds = $78,100 (using the same exchange rate)\n$261,000 - $78,100 = $182,900\n\nTherefore, the correct total is:\n$182,900 + $533,000 + $387,000 = $1,094,900\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, perform currency calculations, and pay attention to specific details in the question prompt."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "792977_2017.htm", "docs_id": "792977", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "ITEM 2.

The Fresno, California facility has a lease expiration of November 1, 2009, which is relatively far in the future. It's also a large facility at 163,200 square feet, making it less likely to be a prime candidate for immediate closure.\n\nB) Correct. The Bowling Green, Kentucky facility has the earliest lease expiration date (June 30, 2001) among the options provided. It's also the smallest facility at 42,000 square feet.

The statement indicates that management has made normal, recurring adjustments to the quarterly financial data, which is a standard practice in financial reporting.
