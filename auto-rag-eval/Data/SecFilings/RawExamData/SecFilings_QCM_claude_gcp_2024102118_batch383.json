It was originally incorporated as Harley Equities, Ltd. with a broad purpose of purchasing, merging, or acquiring potentially profitable businesses.\n\n2. In 1991, it acquired Financial Express Corporation and changed its focus to developing a nationwide check processing and clearing service.\n\n3.

Currently, the company is searching for new financing or merger opportunities to pursue new business ventures.\n\nThis pattern of changing business focus multiple times is a classic example of a pivot strategy.\n\nA) Corporate restructuring is incorrect because while the company did change its structure, this term typically refers to major changes in a company's financial or operational structures, which isn't the main focus here.\n\nC) Shell company maintenance is incorrect.

Subtract this number from the total fully owned locations.\n\n1. The company owns land at 1,497 locations and buildings at 1,505 locations. The fully owned locations (both land and building) would be the lesser of these two numbers, which is 1,497.\n\n2. 10% of 1,505 owned buildings = 1,505 * 0.10 = 150.5, rounded up to 151 buildings to be sold.\n\n3.

The total cost of owned assets and capitalized leases was $25.7 billion.\n2. The accumulated depreciation was $11.7 billion.\n3. To find the net book value, we subtract the accumulated depreciation from the total cost: $25.7 billion - $11.7 billion = $14 billion.\n4.
