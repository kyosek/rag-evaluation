DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nLannett owns two facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from where all operations are based. The administrative offices, quality control laboratory, and manufacturing and production facilities are located in a 38,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road in Philadelphia. The second facility consists of 65,000 square feet, and is located within 1 mile of the State Road location, 9001 Torresdale Avenue in Philadelphia. Our research laboratory, package, warehousing and distribution operations, sales and accounting departments are located in the second building.\nIn December 2005, the Company refinanced the mortgages on these two properties. As of June 30, 2006, the mortgage balance was approximately $6 million.\nIn June 2006, Lannett signed a lease agreement on a 66,000 square foot facility located on seven acres in Philadelphia. An additional agreement which gives us the option to buy the facility was also signed. This new facility will hold the warehouse, and will become the future headquarters of the Company. We expect to\nbegin occupying the building in December 2006, with full conversion of the facility to take place over another 6 to 9 months. The existing facilities will continue to operate, giving the Company the ability to broaden its manufacturing and pharmaceutical development.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided SecFilings documentation:\n\nQuestion: Lannett's facilities in Philadelphia underwent significant changes in 2005-2006.

Lannett owns two facilities in Philadelphia: a 38,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road and a 65,000 square foot facility at 9001 Torresdale Avenue, totaling 103,000 square feet.

The document states that \"The existing facilities will continue to operate, giving the Company the ability to broaden its manufacturing and pharmaceutical development,\" indicating that Lannett intends to use all three locations to expand its capabilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of abandoning the original facilities. Option C is wrong because the new facility is specifically mentioned to house the warehouse and become the future headquarters, not just administrative offices and the quality control lab.

To find the total revenue, we need to calculate what 100% would be if 20% is $200 million.\n3. We can set up the equation: 20% = $200 million\n4.
