The text states that the company both leases and owns more than 25 sites globally, indicating a mix of property ownership. It also mentions that they believe existing facilities are \"suitable and adequate for our present purposes,\" but leaves room for future changes by noting that \"new facilities will be available in the event we need additional or new space.\" Additionally, the document mentions that some facilities are being subleased and they are seeking to sublease additional space, showing flexibility in their property management. This comprehensive approach aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company doesn't exclusively own its facilities and there's no mention of actively seeking to purchase more properties. Option B is incorrect because while many leases do expire around fiscal year 2021, the company doesn't solely lease properties and shows openness to facility changes. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of consolidating operations to the Massachusetts headquarters; instead, the document emphasizes the global nature of their facilities."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "75488_2012.htm", "docs_id": "75488", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 8.
