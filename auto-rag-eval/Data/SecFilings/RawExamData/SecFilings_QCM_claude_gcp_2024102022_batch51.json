The document states that \"Covance both owns and leases its facilities.\" It then provides examples of substantial leased facilities (e.g., in Princeton, NJ, and Maidenhead, UK for clinical development services) as well as owned facilities (e.g., in Madison, WI, Harrogate, UK, and Muenster, Germany). Additionally, it mentions that Covance owns some buildings in Vienna, VA, while leasing others there. This mix of owned and leased properties across different service areas (clinical development, preclinical, central laboratory) and geographies (US, UK, Germany, Switzerland) supports the balanced approach described in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the information doesn't suggest a clear pattern of leasing in the US and owning internationally. Option B is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and doesn't account for the mix of owned and leased properties in preclinical services.
