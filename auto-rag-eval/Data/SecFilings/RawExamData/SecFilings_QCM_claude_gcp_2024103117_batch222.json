BUSINESS\nFidelity Leasing Income Fund VIII, L.P.

Specifically:\n\n1. The company owns its headquarters in Southfield, Michigan, which it purchased in 1993 and has a mortgage on.\n2. The company leases office space in Henderson, Nevada and Worthing, West Sussex (UK).\n3. In its owned headquarters, the company occupies part of the building (65,000 sq ft out of 118,000 sq ft) and leases the excess space to other tenants.\n\nThis demonstrates a strategy of owning its main facility while leasing in other locations, likely to maintain flexibility. The company also shows a willingness to sublease excess space in its owned property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company doesn't own all spaces and doesn't fully occupy its headquarters.\nOption B is incorrect because the company owns its headquarters, not leases it.\nOption D is incorrect because the leases mentioned have varying expiration dates, some extending several years into the future."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "863157_2014.htm", "docs_id": "863157", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.
