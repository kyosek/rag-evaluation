However, the question asks for the highest annual lease cost, so we must choose the Georgia property at 200 Chastain Center Blvd (option A) over 2550 Heritage Court (option B).\n\nThe total for option A is $818,000 + $280,000 = $1,098,000 per year.\n\nOptions C and D would result in lower totals:\nC: $818,000 + $350,000 = $1,168,000\nD: $818,000 + $247,000 = $1,065,000\n\nTherefore, option A results in the highest annual lease cost and is the correct answer."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "790070_2001.htm", "docs_id": "790070", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2.
