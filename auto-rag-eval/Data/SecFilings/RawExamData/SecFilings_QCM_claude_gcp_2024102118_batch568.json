Calculate the total annual lease expense\n2. Determine what portion of that is for the leased operating facilities\n\nTotal annual lease expense = $8.3 million (facilities) + $258.9 million (outdoor sites) = $267.2 million\n\nPercentage for leased facilities = ($8.3 million / $267.2 million) * 100 = 3.1%\n\nOption B (19.0%) is incorrect as this refers to the percentage of billboard advertising net revenues that the outdoor site leases represent, not the percentage of total lease expenses.\n\nOption C (80.9%) is incorrect as it's the complement of 19.0%, which is not relevant to this question.\n\nOption D (96.9%) is incorrect as it's the complement of the correct answer, representing the percentage of lease expenses for outdoor sites, not facilities.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and avoid being misled by other percentages mentioned in the passage."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1041195_2000.txt", "docs_id": "1041195", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.
