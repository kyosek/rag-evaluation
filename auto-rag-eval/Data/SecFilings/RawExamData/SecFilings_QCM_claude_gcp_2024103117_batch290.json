The company leases its current headquarters in Newton, MA (119,000 sq ft) with a lease expiring in April 2015. It has also entered into a lease for a future headquarters in Needham, MA (280,000 sq ft) to be built.

The passage explicitly states that the company does not legally own any real estate as of December 31, 2013.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases, not owns, the Newton headquarters. Option B is incorrect because the new Needham headquarters is not yet operational; it will be built by the lessor. Option C is close but slightly inaccurate; the total leased space is actually around 501,000 sq ft (119,000 + 382,000) plus the future 280,000 sq ft, which is not yet included in their current leased space."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "31235_2012.htm", "docs_id": "31235", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.
