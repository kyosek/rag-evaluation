The Company divested Elevated Throne to One Bio, Corp. (\u201cONE\u201d) on April 14, 2010.\nIn March 2012, the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Funds Holdings Corp. (\u201cGlobal Funds\u201d) an Ontario, Canada corporation.\nThe Company operates as a public organized shell corporation with the purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business operation.

According to the documentation, Green Planet Bioengineering Co., Ltd. \"now operates as a public reorganized shell corporation with the purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business operation.\" This status is further reinforced in the last paragraph, which states, \"The Company operates as a public organized shell corporation with the purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business operation.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company did operate in the agritech sector in China through Elevated Throne, this subsidiary was divested to One Bio, Corp. in 2010.\n\nOption B is incorrect because One Bio, Corp. acquired Elevated Throne from Green Planet, but Green Planet did not become a subsidiary of One Bio, Corp.\n\nOption D is partially correct in that Green Planet did become a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Funds Holdings Corp. in March 2012. However, the documentation does not indicate that the company is actively engaged in the biotech sector.
