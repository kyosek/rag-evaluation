If the third party's financial condition has significantly deteriorated, it would increase the risk that they might fail to perform their obligations under the lease.

However, the question asks how many would remain to secure the loan, which implies the total number that could still be used for this purpose. Since the company still owns 58 warehouses after the sale (64 - 6 = 58), and this is more than the original 57 securing the loan, the answer is 52 (57 - 6 + 1 = 52).
