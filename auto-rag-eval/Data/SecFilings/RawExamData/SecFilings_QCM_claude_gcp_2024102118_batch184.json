The expiration date of the corporate headquarters lease would have the least impact on relocating a transmission tower. The passage specifically mentions that relocating towers can be significantly costly due to various factors, but does not mention the corporate headquarters lease as one of these factors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because FAA regulations are explicitly mentioned as a factor that can increase the cost of acquiring alternative locations for tower sites.\n\nOption B is incorrect as zoning and land use restrictions are directly stated as limitations that can increase the cost or difficulty of finding alternative tower locations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage clearly states that \"the number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited,\" indicating this is a crucial factor in tower relocation.\n\nThe corporate headquarters lease expiration (Option C) is mentioned in the passage but is unrelated to the challenges of relocating transmission towers, making it the least impactful factor among the given options."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1168455_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1168455", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
