However, the document clearly states that such forward-looking information involves \"important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect actual results and cause them to differ materially from expectations.\" This indicates that while companies are allowed to make these projections, they must also acknowledge the potential for variance and list possible risk factors. The correct answer, C, accurately captures this balance between allowing forward-looking statements and recognizing inherent uncertainties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the protection, implying no legal consequences whatsoever. Option B is too broad, as the provision doesn't protect against all litigation related to financial reports.

The document also states that the company extended its lease at 110 William Street until September 30, 1995, \"at which time all New York operations will relocate to 2 World Trade Center.\" This clearly indicates that by September 30, 1995, the company plans to vacate 110 William Street and consolidate all New York operations at 2 World Trade Center.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company plans to vacate 110 William Street.

The text states that Cymer conducts operations in \"both owned and leased properties.\" It mentions owning the corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facilities in San Diego, as well as a manufacturing facility in Korea.
