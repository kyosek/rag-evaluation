The information is from a past SEC filing, so the current date is not specified.\n\nGiven that the lease expires in October 2021, and assuming this SEC filing is relatively recent (but before October 2021), the maximum time a new company could occupy the space without negotiating a new lease would be approximately 2 years (option A).\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because:\n- The 5-year periods mentioned relate to rate adjustments, not the overall lease term.\n- The 15,000 square feet mentioned is additional space, not a lease duration.\n- The original 20-year term started in 2001 and is set to expire in 2021, so it's not available for a full 20 years from the present.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text and apply critical thinking to a hypothetical business scenario."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "29669_1996.txt", "docs_id": "29669", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.
