The Company recognizes that ISO certification is becoming an increasingly important selling feature both domestically and internationally, as it provides evidence of product quality and consistency to purchasers. This aligns with option D, which accurately reflects the Company's current certification status and its understanding of the importance of these certifications in various markets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all facilities have ISO 9001 certification, and it's not stated as mandatory for operations.

If the average occupancy rate across all hotels is 75%, and the total number of rooms available is evenly distributed among 75% of the hotels, how many rooms does each of these hotels have, assuming the remaining 25% of hotels have a combined total of 1,047 rooms?\n\nA) 486 rooms\nB) 513 rooms\nC) 527 rooms\nD) 541 rooms\n\nCorrect Answer: C) 527 rooms\n\nExplanation:\n1. Total rooms across all 8 hotels: 411 + 299 + 386 + 605 + 337 + 375 + 459 + 310 = 3,182 rooms\n2. 25% of 8 hotels = 2 hotels, which have 1,047 rooms combined\n3. Remaining 75% (6 hotels) have: 3,182 - 1,047 = 2,135 rooms\n4. Assuming even distribution among these 6 hotels: 2,135 \u00f7 6 = 355.83, rounded to 356 rooms per hotel\n5. To verify: 356 \u00d7 6 = 2,136 rooms (close to our 2,135 calculation, difference due to rounding)\n6. Average occupancy of 75% means: 356 \u00d7 0.75 = 267 occupied rooms\n7. Therefore, each of these hotels has: 267 \u00f7 0.75 = 356 available rooms\n8. Adjusting for 75% occupancy: 356 \u00f7 0.75 = 474.67\n9. Rounding up to the nearest whole room: 475 rooms\n10.

Orlando office (relocated): 6,000 sq ft * $0.98/sq ft = $5,880\n   (Using the higher Florida rate of $0.98/sq ft)\n2. Southern California (Brea): 3,000 sq ft * $0.98/sq ft = $2,940\n3. Northern California (San Anselmo): 1,050 sq ft * $2.15/sq ft = $2,257.50\n\nTotal monthly expense: $5,880 + $2,940 + $2,257.50 = $11,077.50\n\nHowever, the question asks for the expense if Orlando were to relocate within the stated timeframe. The documentation mentions a 30-day relocation period for Orlando. This means we need to account for one month at the higher rate:\n\nAdditional cost for one month: (6,000 sq ft * $0.98/sq ft) - (6,000 sq ft * $0.91/sq ft) = $420\n\nTotal expense including relocation: $11,077.50 + $420 = $12,145.50\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) $12,145.50."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "1001288_2002.txt", "docs_id": "1001288", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
