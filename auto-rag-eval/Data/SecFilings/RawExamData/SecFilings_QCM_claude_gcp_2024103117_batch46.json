The documentation states that \"Eventually all functions currently housed in the leased Norcross facilities will be relocated to this new site adjacent to its current Buford facility.\" This indicates that operations from both Norcross facilities (the larger 10,752 square-foot building and the smaller 2,692 square-foot suite) will be moved to the new 80,000 square-foot facility being constructed on the 30 acres of land adjacent to the existing Buford facility.
