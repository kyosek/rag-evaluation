Calculate the number of stores owned or leased from a wholly-owned subsidiary\n2. Calculate the total square footage of these stores\n3. Divide the total square footage by the number of stores\n\n1.

The unusual presentation of financial statements split into \"Successor\" and \"Predecessor\" periods, particularly with a specific date (December 20, 2006) separating them, strongly suggests that the company underwent a significant change in ownership or control.\n\nThis type of presentation is typically used when a company has been acquired, undergone a leveraged buyout, or experienced a similar transaction that results in a change of control. The \"Predecessor\" period represents the company's financial information under its previous ownership structure, while the \"Successor\" period represents the company under its new ownership.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by the short duration of the \"Successor\" period (December 20, 2006 to December 31, 2006), which likely represents the time immediately following the transaction.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because a change in fiscal year wouldn't typically require a \"Successor\" and \"Predecessor\" presentation. Answer B, while plausible, is less likely as restructurings don't usually require this specific accounting treatment unless they involve a change in control.
