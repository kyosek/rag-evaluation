As discussed in Notes 1 and 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K included herewith, gains and losses from the disposition of certain real estate assets and the related historical operating results were reclassified as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.\" This clearly indicates that the differences are due to the reclassification of certain real estate transactions as Discontinued Operations in the annual report.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of errors in the quarterly reports. Option B is also incorrect as there's no indication of a change in accounting methods.

The Company owns 120,000 sq ft in Scranton, PA and 82,000 sq ft in Ransom, PA, totaling 202,000 sq ft. In Texas, they own 101,000 sq ft in Austin. 202,000 > 101,000.\n\nB) Incorrect. The largest owned property is 120,000 sq ft in Scranton, PA, but this isn't the largest overall. The leased NETG headquarters in Naperville, IL is 72,000 sq ft.\n\nC) Incorrect. Owned space: 120,000 + 82,000 + 101,000 = 303,000 sq ft. Leased space: 18,000 (new HQ) + 72,000 (NETG) + 31,000 (Steck-Vaughn) = 121,000 sq ft, plus some unknown amount from the other leases. It's unlikely the additional leases would exceed 182,000 sq ft to surpass the owned space.\n\nD) Incorrect. The largest leased space mentioned is NETG's headquarters in Naperville, IL at 72,000 sq ft.
