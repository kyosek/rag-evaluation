The documentation clearly states that \"On December 31, 1999, Fidelity owned 8 of its branch facilities and leased the remaining 28 of its branch facilities.\" It also mentions that all owned and leased office facilities are located in Southern California with two exceptions: \"the credit processing center located in Beaverton, Oregon and a branch office located in Bloomington, Minnesota.\" This information directly corresponds to option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misrepresents the ownership and leasing arrangements of the branch facilities. Option B is incorrect because it reverses the numbers of owned and leased branches and fails to acknowledge the out-of-state locations.
