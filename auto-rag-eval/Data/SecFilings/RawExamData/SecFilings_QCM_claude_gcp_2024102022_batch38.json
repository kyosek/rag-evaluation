The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The document states that the Company operates 97 bank branches.\n2. It mentions that the Company owns all of its bank branch premises except for two categories:\n   a) Eight branch offices where both land and buildings are leased.\n   b) Ten branch offices where the land is leased but the building is owned.\n3. This means that out of 97 branches, 18 involve some form of leasing (8 + 10).\n4. Therefore, the remaining 79 branch buildings (97 - 18) are fully owned by the Company.\n\nOptions A and B are clearly incorrect based on the information provided.

Divide the tenant improvement allowance by the total lease term in months:\n   $224,000 / 120 months = $1,866.67 per month\n\nHowever, the question states that the amortization begins at the end of 1994, which is 22 months into the lease term.
