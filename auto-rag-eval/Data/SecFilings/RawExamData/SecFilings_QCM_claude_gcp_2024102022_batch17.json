At May 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 22,000 square feet of floor space at its corporate headquarters at 17571 Von Karman Avenue in Irvine, California, 92614 which it has been leasing since 2009. The lease for its headquarters expired on August 31, 2016. The Company had an option to extend the term of its lease for two additional sixty month periods. On November 30, 2015, the Company exercised its option to extend its lease for an additional sixty month period and entered into the First Amendment to Lease wherein it extended its lease until August 31, 2021. The initial base rent for the lease extension is $21,000 per month, increasing to $23,637 through August 31, 2021. The security deposit of $22,080 remains the same. In November 2016, the Company\u2019s Mexican subsidiary, Biomerica de Mexico, entered into a 10-year lease for approximately 8,100 square feet of manufacturing space with initial base rent of $2,926/month. The Company has one 10-year option to renew at the end of the initial lease period. Biomerica de Mexico also leases a smaller unit on a month-to-month basis for use in one manufacturing process.

The question doesn't ask to include the \"smaller unit\" in Mexico or the \"small office\" in Germany, so these are not counted.\n\nFor the combined monthly base rent:\n- Irvine location: $22,000 as of November 2016 (the rent started at $21,000 and increased over time, so by November 2016 it would have increased)\n- Mexico location: $2,926\n\nAdding these together gives $24,926 per month.\n\nOption B is the only one that correctly combines both the total square footage and the monthly base rent."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "812565_1998.txt", "docs_id": "812565", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 2.
