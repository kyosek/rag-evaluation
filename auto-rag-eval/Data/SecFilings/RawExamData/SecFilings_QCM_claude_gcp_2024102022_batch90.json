First, the company's headquarters and principal executive offices are indeed located at Wynyard, Stockton-On-Tees, UK. Second, the document mentions LPC, an unconsolidated manufacturing joint venture that is 50% owned by Venator Materials and 50% by Kronos.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the headquarters are not in St. Louis (which is mentioned as a closed plant location), and not all facilities are owned outright (some are leased, and there's a joint venture).\n\nAnswer B is partially correct about closed facilities but wrongly states that all current plants are fully owned by Venator Materials, which contradicts the information about leased properties and the joint venture.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Easton, Pennsylvania plant closure was mentioned for 2018, there's no information provided about the completion of the closure process by the end of that year."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "29644_1997.txt", "docs_id": "29644", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2.
