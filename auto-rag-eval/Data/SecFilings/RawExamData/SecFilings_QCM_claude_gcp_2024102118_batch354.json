The passage states that \"During the final three quarters of 2006 Genelabs recorded revenue of $2.4 million from an up-front license fee and $1.9 million from ongoing research payments received in conjunction with the collaboration.\" To get the total revenue, we need to add these two figures: $2.4 million + $1.9 million = $4.3 million.\n\nOption A ($1.9 million) represents only the ongoing research payments, while option B ($2.4 million) represents only the up-front license fee.

The company owns significant facilities in Alvin, Texas (88,000 square feet), as well as in Houston, Texas, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Edmonton, Alberta. These owned facilities appear to be key operational centers, including corporate offices, training facilities, and manufacturing sites.

This approach allows for a balance between having control over critical facilities and maintaining flexibility in other locations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does own significant facilities, not just relying on leased properties.

However, the question asks for the reduction after April 2000. The document states that the company does not plan to renew the lease for the 22,000 sq ft space in Lake Mary, which expires in April 2000. This lease has an annual base rent of $149,000.\n\nTherefore, the total annual base rent is $599,000, and the reduction after April 2000 will be $149,000.

The mortgage note payable encumbrance suggests the property is leveraged, introducing financial risk.\n2. The ground lease implies the REIT doesn't own the land, adding another layer of complexity to the property rights.\n3. The variable portion of rent tied to mortgage debt service changes introduces unpredictability in rental income.\n4. The variable interest rate on the mortgage based on either the prime rate or Federal Funds Rate adds another element of financial uncertainty.\n\nThese factors combined create a complex financial structure with multiple potential sources of volatility in returns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ground lease contradicts full ownership of the land, and the variable components contradict stable, predictable cash flows.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the variable components (both in rent and mortgage rate) likely increase risk and decrease stability compared to fixed-rate arrangements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the property is subject to a ground lease, there's no information suggesting it's vacant.
