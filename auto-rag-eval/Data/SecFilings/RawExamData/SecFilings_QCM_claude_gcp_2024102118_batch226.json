The key information is that the annual rental expense of $1,828,000 includes $200,000 to recognize future rental increases on a straight-line basis, and that monthly cash rent payments start lower and increase over time.\n\nGiven this, we can deduce that the actual cash payments in 2003 will be less than the stated annual rental expense.

The melting capacity is 1,200,000 tons, with actual production of 858,600 tons in 1998. This represents a potential increase of about 40% ((1,200,000 - 858,600) / 858,600 * 100 \u2248 40%). The finishing mills have the same capacity of 1,200,000 tons but slightly lower actual production at 838,400 tons.

While it was initially organized to develop surgery centers, the text states that \"The Company did not, however, develop any surgery centers.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company did not successfully diversify into both surgery centers and nursing homes.

The documentation states that the Company's corporate and administrative headquarters is owned by the Company and is subject to a mortgage of $6.4 million as of December 31, 1998. It also mentions that this facility comprises a building of approximately 120,000 square feet on 16.5 acres of land. Additionally, the Company purchased an adjacent 17.9 acres in January 1996. Together, this totals 34.4 acres (16.5 + 17.9).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes the leased facility that houses the loan servicing operations, not the headquarters.\n\nOption C is close but incomplete, as it doesn't account for the additional 17.9 acres purchased in 1996.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it describes the leased facility for loan servicing, not the owned headquarters.\n\nThis question tests the examinee's ability to carefully read and synthesize multiple pieces of information from the text to arrive at the correct answer."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1092367_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1092367", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "ITEM 2.
