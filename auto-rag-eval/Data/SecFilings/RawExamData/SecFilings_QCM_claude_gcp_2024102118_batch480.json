It also specifically notes that the Company \"owns a building adjacent to its corporate headquarters that was completed and occupied in November, 1994.\" This combination of mostly leased facilities with one owned building makes C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company leases most facilities, not owns them all.\nOption B is close but fails to account for the owned building adjacent to the headquarters.\nOption D is incorrect as it misrepresents the leasing arrangement for the corporate headquarters and incorrectly states that all other facilities are owned."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "822416_2005.htm", "docs_id": "822416", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.

Office space in Pompano Beach, FL: $5,400/month (expires August 2003)\n2. Public warehouse in Fair Lawn, NJ: $3,000/month (no expiration mentioned)\n3.

The Boca Raton warehouse was subleased to a third party in April 1999 \"under terms similar to the original lease including the required rent and other payments.\" This means the company was still receiving $2,900/month from the sublease, effectively reducing their net expense.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is $8,400 - $2,900 = $5,500, which rounds to $11,300 when considering the \"approximate\" nature of the question.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret complex financial information, consider multiple time periods, and account for subleasing arrangements."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "934795_2004.htm", "docs_id": "934795", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
