Number of communities to be sold:\n   259 * 15% = 259 * 0.15 = 38.85\n\n   Since we can't sell a fraction of a community, we round down to 38.\n\n2. Remaining communities:\n   259 - 38 = 221\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the sale should be evenly distributed across all markets. With 43 markets, it's impossible to sell exactly 38 communities evenly. The closest number that's divisible by 43 is 39 (43 * 0.907).\n\nTherefore, the REIT would actually sell 39 communities to ensure even distribution across markets.\n\nFinal calculation: 259 - 39 = 220 communities remaining\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret complex information, perform percentage calculations, and consider practical constraints in real-world scenarios."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "95585_1998.txt", "docs_id": "95585", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately represents the company's real estate footprint?\n\nA) The company owns all of its office spaces in New York, London, and Tokyo, totaling approximately 2 million square feet.\n\nB) Lehman Brothers' Asian headquarters in Tokyo occupies more square footage than its European headquarters in London.\n\nC) The company leases approximately 2,510,000 square feet of office space across its New York metropolitan area and European headquarters locations.\n\nD) Lehman Brothers maintains offices in exactly 124 locations globally, including its headquarters in New York, London, and Tokyo.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that Lehman Brothers leases approximately 1,500,000 square feet of office space in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, their European headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, is an 820,000 square foot leased facility. Adding these two figures gives us 2,320,000 square feet, which is closest to the 2,510,000 square feet mentioned in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company owns its New York headquarters but leases its London and Tokyo offices. \n\nOption B is false because the European headquarters in London occupies 820,000 square feet, while the Asian headquarters in Tokyo occupies only 190,000 square feet.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company has offices in over 115 locations in the Americas and additional locations in Europe and Asia, the exact total is not specified and is likely more than 124 when all global locations are considered.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and synthesize information from different parts of the document, perform simple calculations, and identify the most accurate statement based on the given data."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "921051_1997.txt", "docs_id": "921051", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2.

It correctly states that the Savings Bank operates from 14 locations (main office plus 13 branches), mentions the two lots behind the Doylestown branch (one with a leased building, one used for parking), and accurately describes the vacant lot in Newtown, including its purpose (future expansion) and net book value ($1.6 million as of December 31, 1997).\n\nOption A is incorrect as it misses the New Jersey location and misinterprets the $1.6 million as the purchase price rather than the net book value.\n\nOption C is incomplete as it doesn't mention the additional properties owned by the Savings Bank.\n\nOption D contains some correct information but mismatches the values and purposes of the properties.
