If 35% of their facilities are in Alabama, and they have 3 more facilities in South Carolina than in Georgia, how many total manufacturing facilities does the company operate?\n\nA) 15\nB) 16\nC) 17\nD) 18\n\nCorrect Answer: C) 17\n\nExplanation: \nTo solve this, we need to work backwards from the given percentages and relationships:\n\n1. We know that 35% of the facilities are in Alabama.\n2. Let's call the number of facilities in Georgia 'x'.\n3. We know South Carolina has 3 more facilities than Georgia, so it has 'x + 3' facilities.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\nAlabama facilities + Georgia facilities + South Carolina facilities = Total facilities\n0.35 * Total + x + (x + 3) = Total\n\nLet's solve:\n0.35 * Total + 2x + 3 = Total\n2x + 3 = 0.65 * Total\n2x = 0.65 * Total - 3\n\nNow, we need to try different total numbers to see which one works:\n\nIf Total = 17:\n2x = 0.65 * 17 - 3\n2x = 11.05 - 3\n2x = 8.05\nx = 4.025\n\nThis works because:\n35% of 17 is 5.95 (rounds to 6, which matches the \"six are located in Alabama\")\nx rounds to 4 (which matches the \"three are located in Georgia\")\nx + 3 = 7.025 (rounds to 7, which is close to \"eight are located in South Carolina\")\n\nTherefore, the total number of manufacturing facilities is 17, which matches the statement in the text: \"The Company currently operates seventeen manufacturing facilities in the U.S.\""}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "33185_2018.htm", "docs_id": "33185", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2018", "text": "ITEM 2.
