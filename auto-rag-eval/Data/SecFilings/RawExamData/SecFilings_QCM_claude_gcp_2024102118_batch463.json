On January 9, 2009, we entered into a sublease with Hallinan Capital Corp. for approximately 1,978 square feet of office space located at Three Bala Plaza East, Suite 101, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004. The premises will serve as the Company\u2019s new corporate headquarters.

In the event that neither party provides such notice, the sublease will continue on a month to month basis, with either party having the right to terminate at any time upon the provision of six months written notice. The sublease will, however, terminate without regard to such notice provisions upon the expiration or termination of the lease under which the premises have been sublet to the Company.

After October 2009, the rent increases by $1,978 per annum.\n3. To calculate the annual rent for the second year:\n   - Monthly rent: $5,192.25\n   - Annual rent: $5,192.25 * 12 = $62,307\n   - Add the annual increase: $62,307 + $1,978 = $64,285\n4. However, this is not the correct answer because the question asks for the total annual rent in the second year, which would include the full $1,978 increase for the entire year.\n5.

Initially, the company leased 2,892 sq ft in 2006. In April 2007, they added 3,210 sq ft. So the total square footage is 2,892 + 3,210 = 6,102 sq ft. \n\nFor the rent, we need to look at the September 2008 lease addendum, which states they \"renegotiated the first two-year extension base rent to $10,068\" starting April 1, 2009.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the wrong square footage and the rent amount from June 2008, not the renegotiated amount.\nOption C uses only the additional space leased in 2007 and an outdated rent amount.\nOption D uses the wrong square footage (mistaking the initial monthly rent for square footage) but has the correct renegotiated rent.\n\nOnly option B correctly combines the total leased space and the renegotiated rent for the extension period."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1561951_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1561951", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.

The lease expires in 1999 and the Company currently pays approximately $19,000 per month in rent, including sales tax and maintenance fees. The rent is adjusted annually based upon changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. The lease also requires the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance and certain costs for maintaining the premises. Management believes that suitable premises are readily available on acceptable terms should the present premises become unavailable for any reason.\nThe Company also leases a 25,000 square foot custom-designed facility in Menlo Park, California that includes office space, fully-equipped laboratories for transdermal drug delivery research and production capabilities.

A 40,000 square foot space in Pompano Beach, Florida, for which they pay approximately $19,000 per month.\n2. A 25,000 square foot facility in Menlo Park, California, for which they pay approximately $28,000 per month.\n\nThe total monthly rental expense is therefore $19,000 + $28,000 = $47,000.\n\nThe question also asks about a factor that could affect this amount in the future.

Original sublease + Amendment (38,000 sq ft):\n   Monthly rent: $141,276\n   Annual rent: $141,276 * 12 = $1,695,312\n\n2. Additional lease (30,615 sq ft):\n   Monthly rent in 2014: $210,478 (since it's after 2013)\n   Annual rent: $210,478 * 12 = $2,525,736\n\n3.

To avoid double-counting, we need to add the additional 10,000 sq ft from the amendment:\n\n4. Amendment additional cost:\n   Total sublease payments: $20.8 million\n   Lease term: 13 years, 5 months (March 2003 to July 2016)\n   Approximate annual cost: $20.8 million / 13.5 years = $1,540,741\n   Proportion for 10,000 sq ft: (10,000 / 38,000) * $1,540,741 = $405,458\n\n5. Additional space annual rent: $405,458\n6. Remaining space annual rent: $598,426 (difference between total sublease rent and original sublease rent)\n\nFinal total annual rent: $4,221,048 + $405,458 + $598,426 = $5,224,932\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading, multiple calculations, and consideration of overlapping lease terms and spaces."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "1183941_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1183941", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
