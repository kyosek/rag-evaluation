The key points are:\n1. The company owns studio facilities in 23 markets.\n2. The company owns transmitter and antenna sites in 51 markets.\n3. To have fully company-owned facilities, a market must have both company-owned studios and company-owned transmitter/antenna sites.\n\nTo solve this, we need to understand that the 23 markets with owned studios are likely a subset of the 51 markets with owned transmitter/antenna sites. This is because it wouldn't make sense for the company to own more studio facilities than transmitter sites.\n\nTherefore, the markets with fully company-owned facilities are at most 23 (the smaller number). \n\nIf the company operates in 100 markets total, then the percentage of markets with fully company-owned facilities is:\n\n(23 / 100) * 100 = 23%\n\nHowever, this is the maximum possible percentage.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the changes in their property leases?\n\nA) The company moved its principal executive offices from a 47,000 square foot facility in Poway, California to an 8,500 square foot facility in Suwanee, Georgia.\n\nB) The company terminated its lease on a 47,000 square foot facility in Poway, California and entered into a new lease for a 21,300 square foot facility in the same city, resulting in a net reduction of leased space by 25,700 square feet.\n\nC) The company's new lease in Poway, California is for a term of 7 years, which is longer than the remaining term of the terminated lease for the larger facility.\n\nD) The company's Diagnostic Imaging operations were moved to Suwanee, Georgia as part of the restructuring initiative.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The company terminated its lease on a 47,000 square foot facility in Poway, California, and entered into a new lease for a 21,300 square foot facility in the same city. This resulted in a net reduction of leased space by 25,700 square feet (47,000 - 21,300 = 25,700).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company does have principal executive offices in Suwanee, Georgia, this was not stated as a move from the Poway facility.\n\nAnswer C, while close, is not the most accurate statement. The new lease in Poway is indeed for 7 years (from March 1, 2014 through February 28, 2021), and this is longer than the remaining term of the terminated lease (which would have continued through February 29, 2016).
