Since each three-bedroom unit adds one extra accommodation compared to a two-bedroom unit, the maximum number of three-bedroom units would be 96 (48 * 2), which would create 96 extra accommodations to reach 508 from the base of 412 (556 - 144).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 96."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "883670_1997.txt", "docs_id": "883670", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2.
