DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nAs of June 28, 2003, The Company operated from 139 leased facilities in the United States and two leased facilities in Canada (not including customer-owned facilities). These facilities are principally used for distribution and warehousing operations. The table below summarizes the location of our current leased facilities within the United States:\nThe Company\u2019s corporate headquarters is located at Four Paramount Plaza, 7803 Glenroy Road, Suite 200, Bloomington, Minnesota. The Company believes that its properties are well maintained, in good condition and adequate for its present needs. Furthermore, the Company believes that suitable additional or replacement space will be available when required.\nIndex to Financial Statements As of June 28, 2003, the Company leased approximately 735 vehicles of various types through operating leases, which were operated by drivers employed by the Company. The Company also engages independent contractors who provide their own vehicles and are required to carry insurance coverage at levels dictated by the Company.\nAggregate rental expense, primarily for facilities, was approximately $15.5 million for the year ended June 28, 2003.

The first part states that \"As of June 28, 2003, The Company operated from 139 leased facilities in the United States and two leased facilities in Canada\". This totals 141 leased facilities. The second part of the information needed is found in the statement \"Aggregate rental expense, primarily for facilities, was approximately $15.5 million for the year ended June 28, 2003.\"\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately combines these two pieces of information. Option B is incorrect because it only counts the U.S. facilities and excludes the two in Canada. Options C and D are incorrect because they list an inaccurate rental expense amount.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from different parts of a financial document and pay attention to details such as the inclusion of international facilities."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1006240_1996.txt", "docs_id": "1006240", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.

The passage lists specific numbers of offices for several counties, which we need to sum:\n\n10 (Shasta) + 9 (Butte) + 7 (Sacramento) + 5 (Placer) + 4 (Stanislaus) + 3 (Siskiyou) + 3 (Sutter) + 3 (Kern) + 2 (Glenn) + 2 (Yolo) = 48 offices\n\nThen, it mentions 13 counties with one office each, but these are part of the \"remaining counties\" in our question. So we don't count these yet.\n\nThe total number of offices is given as 61. So, to find the number of offices in the remaining counties:\n\n61 (total) - 48 (accounted for) = 13 offices\n\nOf these 13 offices, we know that 3 are accounted for in the list of counties with one office each (because 51 offices were initially accounted for, and 51 - 48 = 3).\n\nTherefore, the number of offices in the truly \"remaining\" counties is:\n\n13 - 3 = 10 offices\n\nThis problem tests the ability to carefully read, organize information, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "1124941_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1124941", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.
