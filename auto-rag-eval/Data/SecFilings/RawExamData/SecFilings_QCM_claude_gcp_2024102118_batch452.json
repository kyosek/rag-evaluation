Bridgeton, Missouri headquarters: 61,500 sq ft total, but we need to subtract the 20,500 sq ft leased by the Bank. So, 61,500 - 20,500 = 41,000 sq ft owned by the Company.\n2. Columbus, Ohio production facility: 45,500 sq ft\n3. St. Louis banking facility owned by the Bank (which is a subsidiary of the Company): 1,600 sq ft\n\nTotal: 41,000 + 45,500 + 1,600 = 88,100 sq ft\n\nThe closest option to this calculation is 107,000 sq ft (option B).\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading of the documentation, distinguishing between owned and leased properties, and considering the Bank's owned property as part of the Company's total.

To find the total number of stores, we add 141 + 225 = 366 stores. \n\nTo determine the total number of states, we need to consider that some states might overlap between ShopKo and Pamida locations. The question requires careful reading to note that ShopKo operates in \"Midwest, Western Mountain and Pacific Northwest states\" while Pamida operates in \"Midwest, North Central and Rocky Mountain states\". This suggests some overlap in the Midwest region. \n\nWithout a full list of states for each brand, we can't determine the exact overlap.
