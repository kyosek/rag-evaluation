The documentation states that as of December 2003, the company leased 3,600 sq ft in Buckinghamshire, UK, with future minimum lease payments of $0.6 million. In January 2004, they terminated this lease and moved to a new location in Windsor, UK, leasing approximately 800 sq ft with minimum lease payments of $0.2 million over two years. This represents a reduction in both leased space and financial commitment in the UK.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it confuses the Illinois and UK leases. Option C is incorrect as the $3.1 million commitment was for the Illinois lease, not a new UK lease. Option D is incorrect because while the company did cease using 22,000 sq ft of its Illinois space, it was still leasing the full 43,100 sq ft and attempting to sublease the unused portion, with no mentioned change to the $3.1 million commitment."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "1324948_2015.htm", "docs_id": "1324948", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "ITEM 2.
