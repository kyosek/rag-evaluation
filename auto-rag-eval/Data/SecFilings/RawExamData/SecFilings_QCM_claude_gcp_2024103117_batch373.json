Based on the information provided, what is the total square footage of their leased space, and what unique option does the company have regarding their headquarters lease?\n\nA) 138,900 sq ft; Option to terminate the lease in June 2013 or June 2015\nB) 113,900 sq ft; Option to extend the lease for two additional five-year terms\nC) 88,900 sq ft; Option to terminate the lease in June 2011 or June 2014\nD) 163,900 sq ft; Option to receive a tenant improvement allowance of $958,500\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The company leases 113,900 square feet for their headquarters, plus an additional 25,000 square feet of adjacent office space. This totals 138,900 square feet (113,900 + 25,000). The unique option mentioned for the headquarters lease is the ability to terminate the lease effective June 2013 or June 2015, provided they give notice and pay a termination fee. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while the company does have renewal options, the total square footage is wrong. Option C is incorrect because it understates the total square footage and mentions termination options for the adjacent office space, not the headquarters. Option D is incorrect because it overstates the square footage and the tenant improvement allowance was a past event, not a future option."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1013220_1997.txt", "docs_id": "1013220", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 8.
