The passage states that Travis Boating Center leases its corporate offices in Austin, Texas. It also mentions that the company owns \"numerous other Travis Boating Center locations,\" implying a mix of owned and leased retail properties. For the leased properties, the information specifies that lease terms generally range from five to ten years with additional multi-year renewal options. This combination of leasing the corporate office and owning some retail locations while leasing others with the described terms matches option D most accurately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states the company exclusively leases all properties, which contradicts the information about owning numerous locations.

The text clearly states that forward-looking statements contain projections of future results of operations or financial positions, and that these statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated future results. The passage warns that one should not rely on these statements precisely because of these uncertainties.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the text explicitly states that these statements are \"not historical facts.\"\n\nAnswer B is wrong because the passage advises against fully relying on these statements due to associated risks and uncertainties. The Act mentioned does not require these statements to be accurate, but rather allows for their inclusion with appropriate cautionary language.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the text does provide examples of words that might indicate forward-looking statements, it does not limit identification to only these words, and it broadly defines forward-looking information."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "1085476_2000.txt", "docs_id": "1085476", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.
