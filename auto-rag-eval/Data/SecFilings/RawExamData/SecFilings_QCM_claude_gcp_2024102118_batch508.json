The documentation states that while land in urban areas is owned by the State, companies can obtain land usage rights for extended periods (up to 50 years for industrial purposes and 40 years for commercial purposes). These rights can be renewed, transferred, leased, or mortgaged, and are protected by state laws.

Calculate the current annual rent:\n   $25,000 per month \u00d7 12 months = $300,000 per year\n\n2. Calculate the difference between current and 2000 annual rent:\n   $300,000 - $226,400 = $73,600\n\n3. Calculate the percentage increase:\n   ($73,600 / $226,400) \u00d7 100 = 32.5%\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and calculate percentage increases.
