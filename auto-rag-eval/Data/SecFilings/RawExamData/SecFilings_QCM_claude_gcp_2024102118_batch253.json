The company leases space in multiple locations, but not all are currently occupied for operations. The headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida occupies 31,000 sq ft. In Chesterfield, Missouri, they lease two spaces totaling 35,000 sq ft for corporate offices and a data center. The facilities in Atlanta, Georgia (8,500 sq ft) and Toronto, Canada (5,400 sq ft) are explicitly stated as no longer occupied and subleased to third parties.
