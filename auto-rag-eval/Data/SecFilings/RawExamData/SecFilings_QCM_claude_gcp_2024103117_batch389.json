This information directly corresponds to answer choice C, which correctly states that 21 wells were producing and 4 wells were sold in 1996.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it states that all 25 wells were producing and none were sold, which contradicts the information provided.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it assumes the 4 wells not producing were non-productive, when in fact they were sold.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it states that all 25 wells were producing and 4 were sold in 2000, which is not consistent with the information provided about the sale occurring in 1996 and only 21 wells producing at the end of 2000."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "855684_2000.txt", "docs_id": "855684", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

Here's how to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. The Company owns 1,400 heavy construction vehicles directly.\n2. Joint ventures own an additional 210 heavy construction vehicles.\n3. We're told to assume the Company owns 25% of the joint ventures' assets.\n4. 25% of 210 is 52.5, which we round up to 53 (as we can't have partial vehicles).\n5. So the total number of heavy construction vehicles attributable to the Company is:\n   1,400 (directly owned) + 53 (25% of joint ventures) = 1,453\n\n6. However, the question asks for the total number \"owned or operated\" by the Company and its joint ventures, which would include all of the joint ventures' vehicles.\n7.
