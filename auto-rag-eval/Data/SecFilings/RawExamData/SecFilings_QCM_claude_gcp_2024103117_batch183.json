The data shows that the percentage of sales from life insurance contracts has remained relatively stable over the reported period (1988-1996), consistently staying between 80% and 84%. However, there is a slight downward trend observable when comparing the earlier years to the later years. In 1988, life insurance contracts accounted for 84.18% of sales, while in 1996 this figure was 80.78%. This represents a small but noticeable decrease over time, indicating a slight diversification away from life insurance products, though they remain the company's primary focus.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the data does not show a steady increase in the percentage of sales from life insurance contracts.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because, while the focus has been consistent, there have been fluctuations and a slight downward trend, which is not captured by the term \"minimal fluctuation.\"\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because, while there is a slight downward trend, it would be an overstatement to call it a \"clear trend of diversification.\" The company still derives over 80% of its sales from life insurance products throughout the reported period."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1037868_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1037868", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nThe Company has 110 operating plant facilities in 23 states and 13 foreign countries.

Office lease: $69,000 (2010) + $52,000 (2011) = $121,000\n2. Laboratory space: $13,942 per year x 2 years = $27,884\n3.
