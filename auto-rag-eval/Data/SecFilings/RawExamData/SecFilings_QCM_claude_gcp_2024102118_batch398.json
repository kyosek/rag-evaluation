What is the percentage increase in net sales from Q1 to Q3, and what factor might explain the slight decrease in Q4 sales?\n\nA) 20.5% increase; seasonal fluctuations in demand\nB) 15.3% increase; impact of special charges\nC) 18.2% increase; market price volatility\nD) 10.7% increase; tax settlement effects\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. To calculate the percentage increase from Q1 to Q3, we use the formula: (Q3 - Q1) / Q1 * 100 = ($80,171 - $66,511) / $66,511 * 100 = 20.5% increase. The slight decrease in Q4 sales compared to Q3 could be attributed to seasonal fluctuations in demand, which is common in many industries.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while special charges are mentioned in the data, they don't directly explain the sales pattern.\n\nOption C is incorrect because although market prices fluctuated, this doesn't directly explain the sales pattern.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the tax settlement mentioned in the footnote affects earnings per share, not sales figures.\n\nThis question tests the ability to calculate percentage changes, interpret financial data across quarters, and consider factors that might influence sales patterns."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1633931_2015.htm", "docs_id": "1633931", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "Item 2.
