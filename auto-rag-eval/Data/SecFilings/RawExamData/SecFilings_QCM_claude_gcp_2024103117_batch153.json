Assuming a normal distribution, about 68% of facilities would be within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three.\n5. Given the large outlier, we can estimate that facilities with fewer than 50 doors are about one standard deviation below the mean.\n6. In a normal distribution, approximately 15.9% of data points are more than one standard deviation below the mean.\n7. 15.9% of 187 owned facilities is about 29.7.\n8.
