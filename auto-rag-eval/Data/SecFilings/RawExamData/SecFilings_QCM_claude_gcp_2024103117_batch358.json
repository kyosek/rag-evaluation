The document states that Motorola Solutions primarily utilized six major facilities for manufacturing and distribution, located in Penang, Malaysia; Elgin, Illinois; Plano, Texas; McAllen, Texas; Vancouver, BC, Canada; and Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. Additionally, it mentions that approximately 59% of products were manufactured in Penang, making it the location with the highest percentage of production.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company did own a manufacturing facility in Europe, it did not own one in the U.S. Also, the majority of production occurred in Penang (59%), not Illinois (19%).\n\nOption B is incorrect because although the company did lease 232 facilities, the split was not even. The document states 128 were in the Americas and 104 in other countries.\n\nOption D is incorrect on two counts. First, the company did not own all its major manufacturing facilities (it owned only three facilities total).
