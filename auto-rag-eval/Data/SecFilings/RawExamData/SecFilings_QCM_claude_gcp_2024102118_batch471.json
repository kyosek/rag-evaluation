The documentation indicates that Bethlehem not only manufactures a wide variety of steel mill products but also has operations in iron ore production, which can serve both internal needs and external customers. Additionally, the company operates railroad, trucking, and lake shipping services, which primarily (but not exclusively) transport materials for Bethlehem's own operations. This vertical integration and the potential for serving external customers in some capacities make C the most accurate choice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it understates the importance of Bethlehem's transportation and logistics operations. Option B is too limiting, as it doesn't account for the possibility of external sales of iron ore or transportation services.
