The document clearly states that these statements may involve risks and uncertainties, and the company gives no assurance that expectations will be realized. This aligns with answer D, which acknowledges both the protection aspect and the inherent risks of forward-looking statements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the document explicitly states that the company gives no assurance that expectations will be realized. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the provisions specifically relate to forward-looking statements, not historic facts.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the provisions offer some protection, they do not allow for completely consequence-free speculative statements.
