Let's break it down:\n\n1. Calhoun, Georgia: 47,500 sq ft (headquarters office)\n2. Dalton, Georgia: 2,089,000 sq ft (Mohawk segment)\n3. Monterey, Mexico: 1,744,072 sq ft (Dal-Tile segment)\n4. Muskogee, Oklahoma: 974,900 sq ft (Dal-Tile segment)\n\nThe question specifically asks about tile production, which falls under the Dal-Tile segment. Between the two Dal-Tile facilities, Monterey, Mexico (1,744,072 sq ft) is significantly larger than Muskogee, Oklahoma (974,900 sq ft). \n\nWhile the Dalton, Georgia facility is larger overall, it's used by the Mohawk segment, not Dal-Tile, so it wouldn't be suitable for consolidating tile production.\n\nTherefore, the Monterey, Mexico facility (option C) would provide the most square footage for consolidated North American tile production."}}
