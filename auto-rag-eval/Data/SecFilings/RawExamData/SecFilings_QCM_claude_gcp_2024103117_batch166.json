Let's break it down:\n\n1. The original lease started on March 1, 2006, with an annual rental cost of $44,200.\n\n2. The company expanded by assuming an adjacent lease on October 1, 2006. This assumed lease had an annual rental cost of $19,500.\n\n3. The question asks for the total annual rental cost as of October 1, 2007, which is exactly one year after assuming the adjacent lease.\n\n4. At this point, both leases were still in effect at their original rates.\n\n5. Therefore, the total annual rental cost would be the sum of both leases:\n   $44,200 (original lease) + $19,500 (assumed lease) = $63,700\n\nOption B is incorrect because it includes the increased rate of $22,860 for the assumed lease, which didn't take effect until September 30, 2008.\n\nOption C is a distractor that's close to the correct amount but slightly off.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it uses the new lease amount of $63,045 from 2011, which is not relevant to the time period in question.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease information, paying close attention to dates and amounts."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1002519_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1002519", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.

Calculate the total number of containers\n2. Determine 5% of that total\n3. Calculate the net gain for selling that number of containers\n\n1. Total containers:\n   20-foot dry: 4,418\n   40-foot dry: 1,479\n   40-foot high-cube dry: 1,730\n   20-foot refrigerated: 87\n   40-foot high-cube refrigerated: 297\n   24,000-liter tanks: 52\n   Total: 8,063 containers\n\n2. 5% of 8,063 = 403.15 (rounded to 403 containers)\n\n3. Net gain calculation:\n   Average net gain per container in 2003: $137\n   Total net gain: 403 \u00d7 $137 = $55,211\n\nHowever, this is a trick question. The passage states that only certain types of containers were disposed of in 2003 (mainly dry cargo containers). The average net gain of $137 likely doesn't apply to the entire fleet, especially considering the more expensive refrigerated and tank containers.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that we don't have enough information to accurately calculate the net gain for the entire fleet, as different container types would likely have different net gains when sold.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate we can make is to assume the $137 average applies to all containers, even though this is likely an underestimate.

The original building had 29,000 sq ft total, with 21,000 sq ft for manufacturing.\n2. A 20,000 sq ft addition was made in 1996.\n3. The new total square footage is 29,000 + 20,000 = 49,000 sq ft.\n4. We need to assume the proportion of manufacturing space remained constant.\n5. Originally, manufacturing space was 21,000 / 29,000 = 72.41% of the total.\n6. To find the new manufacturing space: 72.41% of 49,000 = 35,481 sq ft\n7. The percentage of manufacturing space in the expanded facility is:\n   35,481 / 49,000 = 0.7241 = 72.41%\n\nThe question asks for this percentage expressed as a fraction over 100, which is 42.86/100 or 42.86%.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret complex information, make appropriate assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "826595_1998.txt", "docs_id": "826595", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 1.
