It also mentions that these leases may require the company to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and other operating costs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the terms, stating 5-year initial terms with ten-year renewals, which is not consistent with the information provided.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the company leases all of the properties on which they operate restaurants, as well as their central support office.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the leases may provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, the company generally does not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1057060_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1057060", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nWe lease our corporate offices in Clearwater, Florida.

The liquefied natural gas storage plant has a send-out capability of 70,000 Dths per day. Through the acquisition of Wisconsin Southern, Wisconsin Natural acquired propane tanks for peaking purposes. These tanks will provide approximately 10,000 Dths of supply to the system. For additional information see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe liquefied natural gas plant is located on land owned in fee by Wisconsin Natural.
