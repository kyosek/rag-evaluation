The documentation clearly states that SecFilings leases their corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. It also mentions that they incur costs for additional properties around the world for various purposes such as research and development, sales and support offices, warehouses, and test facilities. Importantly, the text explicitly states that they do not own any manufacturing facilities and instead contract and license third parties for production and distribution of their hardware. This information directly aligns with option C, which accurately summarizes their real estate strategy of leasing properties and not owning manufacturing facilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states they own their headquarters, which is false according to the text.

The total occupied space as of October 26, 2007 was approximately 270,000 square feet (193,000 + 58,000 + 19,000). The reduction of 50,000 square feet represents about 18.5% of the total space (50,000 / 270,000 = 0.1852 or 18.52%). However, this reduction is specifically from the headquarters space, which was 193,000 square feet. The reduction of 50,000 square feet from the headquarters represents about 25.9% of the headquarters space (50,000 / 193,000 = 0.2591 or 25.91%). The documentation also states that this space \"has been unoccupied since early 2007 when we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining rent to be paid on this space.\" Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it accurately represents both the percentage of reduction from the headquarters space and the status of the space prior to the planned reduction."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "1076541_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1076541", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.
