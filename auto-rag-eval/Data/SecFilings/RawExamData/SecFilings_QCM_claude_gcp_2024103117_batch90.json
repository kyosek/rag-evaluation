Main lease for 65,000 sq ft: $56,908 per month\n2. Lease for 15,000 sq ft: $13,133 per month\n3. Additional 6,000 sq ft lease: $3,300 per month\n\nTotal monthly lease payment: $56,908 + $13,133 + $3,300 = $73,341\n\nFor 4 months: $73,341 * 4 = $293,364\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the income from the sub-lease to MAXxess:\nSub-lease income: $10,000 per month\nFor 4 months: $10,000 * 4 = $40,000\n\nFinal calculation: $293,364 - $40,000 = $253,364\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading of the lease terms, attention to detail in calculations, and consideration of the sub-lease income.

The asterisk (*) notation in the documentation explicitly states: \"Expressed in equivalent units of production with barrels of oil converted to cubic feet of gas on a 6-to-1 basis.\" This means that for the purpose of calculating average production cost, each barrel of oil is considered equivalent to 6 cubic feet of gas.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it reverses the ratio, suggesting a 1-to-6 conversion instead of the correct 6-to-1.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as it misinterprets the meaning of the 6-to-1 ratio, suggesting it refers to six types of hydrocarbons rather than a conversion ratio between oil and gas.\n\nAnswer D is close but incorrect because it mentions cubic meters of gas instead of cubic feet.
