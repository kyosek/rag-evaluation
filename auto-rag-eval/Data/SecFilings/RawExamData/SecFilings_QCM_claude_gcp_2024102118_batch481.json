If the lease began in 2003, what is the average annual rent per square foot, assuming a total lease cost of $18,137,400 for the entire period?\n\nA) $42.50\nB) $45.00\nC) $47.50\nD) $50.00\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the lease duration: From 2003 to January 31, 2010 is 7 years.\n2. Calculate the total square footage over the lease period: 60,458 sq ft * 7 years = 423,206 sq ft-years\n3. Divide the total lease cost by the total square footage: $18,137,400 / 423,206 = $42.86 per sq ft-year\n4.
