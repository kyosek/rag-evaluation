PROPERTIES\nThe Company's principal facility is a 105,000 square foot building located in East Syracuse, New York. The plant was constructed during fiscal 1981 and expanded during fiscal year 1985. This facility houses all of the Company's marketing, manufacturing, administrative, research and development, systems design and engineering experimentation activities. The construction of this facility was originally financed through the issuance of Onondaga County Industrial Revenue Bonds in the original amount of $5,940,000 (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning encumbrances on the facility).\nAnaren Microwave, Ltd., the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, leases a 20, 000 square foot facility in Frimley, England which previously housed the administrative, marketing, and manufacturing operations of that subsidiary prior to the Company's divestiture of its electronic warfare simulator manufacturing operation in March 1996. Annual rental cost of this facility is approximately $385,000 and the Company is presently subletting a portion of the facility for approximately $192,000 annually (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe foregoing facilities are regarded by management as adequate for the current and anticipated short-term future requirements of the Company's business.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Anaren Microwave, Ltd.'s facility in Frimley, England demonstrates which of the following financial strategies?\n\nA) Full utilization of owned property to maximize return on investment\nB) Leveraging of leased space through subletting to offset costs\nC) Recent expansion of manufacturing capabilities in the UK\nD) Complete divestiture of all UK-based operations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states that Anaren Microwave, Ltd. leases a 20,000 square foot facility in Frimley, England, with an annual rental cost of approximately $385,000. However, the company is \"presently subletting a portion of the facility for approximately $192,000 annually.\" This clearly demonstrates a strategy of leveraging leased space through subletting to offset costs.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the facility is leased, not owned.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the document mentions a divestiture of electronic warfare simulator manufacturing in March 1996, not a recent expansion.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while there was a divestiture of some operations, the company still maintains a presence in the UK through this leased facility.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to analyze financial information and identify strategic business decisions from given data."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1435736_2009.txt", "docs_id": "1435736", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2.

Twelve wells were plugged and abandoned due to unprofitable operations over several years (1985-1996).\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all non-producing wells were sold; many were plugged and abandoned.\nOption B is incorrect because natural depletion is not mentioned as a reason for well closure.\nOption D is incorrect because the back-in after payout provision actually added eight wells in 1993, not reducing the number.\n\nThe combination of sales (3 wells) and plugging/abandonment of unprofitable wells (12 wells) accounts for the reduction from 59 to 44 producing wells."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "885307_1999.txt", "docs_id": "885307", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 8.

MRC's manufacturing plant has 120,000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing and 150,000 square feet of total floor space. McL's has 76,000 square feet for manufacturing and 79,000 square feet total. MRC has both more manufacturing space and more total floor space.\n\nB) Correct. The document states that MRC's property has an outstanding mortgage of $1,781,976 as of October 31, 2000. For McL's property, no mortgage is mentioned, and it simply states that the building and land \"are owned by McL\" without any qualifications.\n\nC) Incorrect. The combined manufacturing space is 120,000 (MRC) + 76,000 (McL) = 196,000 square feet, not exactly 200,000.\n\nD) Incorrect. While MRC's property does have a larger land area (7.5 acres vs 5.5 acres for McL), the percentage of total floor space used for manufacturing is higher for MRC (80% - 120,000 out of 150,000) compared to McL (96% - 76,000 out of 79,000)."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1388133_2008.htm", "docs_id": "1388133", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "ITEM 2.
