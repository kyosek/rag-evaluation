This means it's not currently in use, making it immediately available for new operations.\n\n2. While other locations have larger square footage, they are all actively used:\n   - Columbia (107,000 sq ft) and Kirksville (114,000 sq ft) are used as warehouses.\n   - Laurinburg, NC (223,000 sq ft) is already a manufacturing and warehouse facility.\n\n3.

The company states that they expect their facilities to be adequate for business purposes through at least the next 12 months. While the Irving, Texas facility is not currently operational, the company doesn't indicate any plans to sell or repurpose it. Given their forward-looking statement about facility adequacy, it's most likely they're keeping the Irving facility in anticipation of potential future use.

C is unlikely because they already lease sales offices elsewhere and don't indicate plans to convert manufacturing facilities.
