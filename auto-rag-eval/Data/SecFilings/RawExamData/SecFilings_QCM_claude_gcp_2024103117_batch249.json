Calculate total leased space: 3,572,000 - 1,311,000 = 2,261,000 sq ft\n2. Calculate total non-US space: 45% of 3,572,000 = 0.45 * 3,572,000 = 1,607,400 sq ft\n3. Calculate non-US leased space: 1,607,400 - (1,311,000 * 0.45) = 1,607,400 - 589,950 = 1,017,450 sq ft\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is 717,300 sq ft.
