The New York office lease has a term of 12 months and can be terminated with one month's notice, which likely qualifies it as a short-term lease under accounting standards (typically leases of 12 months or less). Short-term leases often have simplified accounting treatments.\n\nIn contrast, the Israeli office lease has a term extending to September 30, 2021 (which is likely more than 12 months from the documentation date), and there's no mention of early termination rights.
