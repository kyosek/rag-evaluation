The key points are:\n\n1. The sale-leaseback transaction occurred on July 19, 2000.\n2. The fiscal year ends on March 24, 2001.\n3. There are approximately 249 days between July 19, 2000, and March 24, 2001.\n4. A full year has 365 days.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of gain recognized in the current fiscal year:\n(249 days / 365 days) * 100 = 68.5%\n\nTherefore, 68.5% of the gain would be recognized in the current fiscal year's income statement, assuming straight-line recognition over the lease term.
