Let's break down the relevant details:\n\n1. Calhoun, Georgia: 47,500 sq ft headquarters office (not a manufacturing facility)\n2. Dalton, Georgia: 2,089,000 sq ft manufacturing facility (Mohawk segment)\n3. Monterey, Mexico: 1,744,072 sq ft manufacturing facility (Dal-Tile segment)\n4. Muskogee, Oklahoma: 974,900 sq ft manufacturing facility (Dal-Tile segment)\n\nThe question asks about consolidating tile production, which falls under the Dal-Tile segment. Between the two Dal-Tile facilities, Monterey, Mexico has the larger square footage at 1,744,072 sq ft, compared to Muskogee, Oklahoma's 974,900 sq ft.\n\nWhile Dalton, Georgia has a larger facility overall, it belongs to the Mohawk segment and may not be suitable for tile production.

The main facility in Calabasas has a lease expiring in November 2004 (about 5 years), with an option to extend. Other significant facilities have leases expiring in 2003 (Morrisville) and 1997 (Columbus). The regional sales offices have leases expiring between 1996 and 1998, which are short-term. This pattern indicates a strategy of using a mix of lease durations, with most falling within a 1-5 year range.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no evidence of long-term leases of 10 years or more.
