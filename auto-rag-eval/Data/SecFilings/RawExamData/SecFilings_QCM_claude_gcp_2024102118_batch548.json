According to the passage, the company's management assessed the impact of the errors and determined that they did not have a material impact on the financial statements for the affected quarters. In such cases, when an error is deemed immaterial, it is generally accepted that no restatement of prior financial statements is necessary.

The company states it believes its existing facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future, indicating satisfaction with the current location.\n\n2. The purchase option at $3.1 million could be financially advantageous. The current annual rent is $230,000, which over 5 years would total $1.15 million. Purchasing the building might be more cost-effective in the long term.\n\n3. The company is already using a significant portion of the building (112,500 sq ft out of 155,000 sq ft), making full ownership logical.\n\n4. The company previously terminated a lease on an adjacent building, suggesting a preference for consolidating operations in one owned property rather than leasing multiple spaces.\n\n5. Ownership would provide more stability and control over the property, aligning with the company's statement about meeting its needs for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile extending the lease (option B) is possible, it's less financially sound in the long term. Terminating the lease entirely (option C) contradicts the company's statement about the adequacy of current facilities.
