It specifically mentions that the corporate headquarters in Rapid City, South Dakota is also leased. The company leases 32 facilities in total as of July 31, 2017.

Calculate the new owned and leased floor space, maintaining the same ratio:\n   New owned: 59% of 12 million = 7.08 million sq ft\n   New leased: 41% of 12 million = 4.92 million sq ft\n\n4.
