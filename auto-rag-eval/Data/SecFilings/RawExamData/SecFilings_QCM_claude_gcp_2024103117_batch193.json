Our leases typically provide for 5- to 10-year initial terms, many with the ability for us (or the landlord) to terminate the lease at specified points during the term if net sales at the leased premises do not reach a certain annual level. Many of our leases provide for payment of percentage rent (i.e., a percentage of net sales in excess of a specified level), and the rate of increase in key ancillary charges is generally capped.\nAs current leases expire, we believe we have the option to obtain favorable lease renewals for present store locations or obtain new leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area. To date, we have not experienced unusual difficulty in either renewing or extending leases for existing locations or securing leases for suitable locations for new stores.\nThe following table indicates the states where our stores are located and the number of stores within each state as of February 1, 2020:\nWe lease all of our distribution locations, and we lease additional overflow warehouse space as needed on a month-to-month basis.

The documentation clearly states that the company leases all of its store locations and expects to continue this practice. It mentions that typical lease terms are 5-10 years for initial periods, with many leases including the ability for either the company or the landlord to terminate the lease if net sales don't reach certain annual levels. This approach gives the company flexibility based on store performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases all locations, not owns them. Option B is wrong because it doesn't account for the possibility of early termination based on sales performance.

Sum the net book values of all owned properties (excluding the building in process).\n2. Calculate the total deposits across all locations.\n3. Calculate the percentage the net book value represents of total deposits.\n\n1. Sum of net book values:\n   $1,234,000 + $75,000 + $121,000 + $683,000 = $2,113,000\n   \n2.
