Piccadilly St and 1095 Millwood Pike, both in Winchester, VA) out of 10 total offices. The oldest owned branch opened in November 1990, not the oldest overall.\n\nB) is incorrect because while the Woodbridge branch was one of the more recent openings (April 1995), it wasn't the most recent. Additionally, its net book value of $109,000 was not the highest among leased properties (the main office in Warrenton had a higher value at $228,000).\n\nC) is incorrect because the company did not have an equal number of owned and leased properties (2 owned vs. 8 leased).

The total cost was $6.183 billion, and the accumulated depreciation was $2.887 billion. Therefore, the net book value is $6.183 billion - $2.887 billion = $3.296 billion.\n\nThis value suggests that the Company's assets are about halfway through their expected useful lives. The accumulated depreciation ($2.887 billion) is slightly less than half of the total cost ($6.183 billion), indicating that, on average, the assets have been depreciated by about 47% of their original value. This implies that the assets are neither very new nor near the end of their useful lives, but rather somewhere in the middle of their expected lifespan.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the value is correct, the interpretation is not accurate.
