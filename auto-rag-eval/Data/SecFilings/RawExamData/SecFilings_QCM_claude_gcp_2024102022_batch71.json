To calculate the percentage this represents of their total leased banking offices, we need to consider that the Bank maintained operations in 83 other locations, of which 74 were banking offices. Since 5 banking office properties were owned, we can deduce that 69 banking offices were leased (74 - 5 = 69). City National Plaza is one additional leased location, bringing the total to 70 leased banking offices. Therefore, City National Plaza represents 1 out of 70 leased banking offices, or approximately 1.43%. However, in terms of square footage, it likely represents a much larger percentage.

Calculate the total number of stores: 637\n2. Calculate 20% of the total stores: 637 * 0.20 = 127.4 (round to 127 for practical purposes)\n3. Calculate the proportion of company-owned stores: 180 / 637 = 0.2826 or 28.26%\n4. Calculate the proportion of stores in strip shopping centers: 456 / 637 = 0.7159 or 71.59%\n5. Calculate the probability of a store being both company-owned and in a strip shopping center: 0.2826 * 0.7159 = 0.2023 or 20.23%\n6. Calculate the expected number of audited stores meeting both criteria: 127 * 0.2023 = 25.69\n\nThe closest answer to 25.69 is 26, which is option A. However, this assumes independence between ownership and location type, which may not be accurate. The question asks for company-owned stores, which include both fully owned (180) and ground-leased (122) for a total of 302. Recalculating with this figure:\n\n302 / 637 = 0.4741 or 47.41%\n0.4741 * 0.7159 = 0.3394 or 33.94%\n127 * 0.3394 = 43.10\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 43, but the closest option to this is 52 (option B), which is therefore the best answer among the given choices."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "99047_2002.htm", "docs_id": "99047", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
