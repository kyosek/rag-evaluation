The passage states that on March 13, 2001, the company \"entered into a non-binding agreement in principle to sell the parcel to an unrelated third party, which sale proceeds would be used to reduce Gaming's indebtedness under the Bank Credit Facility.\" It also explicitly mentions that \"There can be no assurances that Gaming and the third party can reach a definitive purchase and sale agreement for the parcel,\" indicating that the sale is not guaranteed. This matches exactly with option D, making it the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while seeking a joint venture partner for a second hotel casino was considered as an option, the company has not decided to build one.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the agreement is non-binding, not binding.\n\nOption C is partially correct about the lease to Northwind Aladdin, LLC, but it incorrectly states that there are no plans for the 5-acre parcel, which contradicts the information given about the non-binding agreement to sell."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "842517_2002.txt", "docs_id": "842517", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.

However, it also engages in strategic leasing, such as the executive offices in the Comerica Tower (leased, not owned) and the sale/leaseback agreement for the Auburn Hills operations center.\n\nThis mixed approach demonstrates a strategy that balances ownership (particularly in Michigan) with the flexibility of leasing, especially for specialized or temporary needs. Options A and B are incorrect as they oversimplify the strategy and don't accurately represent the ownership/leasing split. Option C is factually incorrect, as the executive offices are explicitly stated to be leased, not owned."}}
