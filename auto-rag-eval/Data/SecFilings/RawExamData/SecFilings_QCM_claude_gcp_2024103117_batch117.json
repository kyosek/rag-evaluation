Bellevue, WA:\n   $98,000/month * 12 months * 5 years = $5,880,000\n\n2. Edison, NJ:\n   $8,000/month * 12 months * 5 years = $480,000\n\n3. San Diego, CA:\n   $2,823/month * 12 months * 5 years = $169,380\n\nTotal: $5,880,000 + $480,000 + $169,380 = $6,529,380\n\nHowever, the question is tricky because the Bellevue lease is only for 62 months, not the full 5 years (60 months). We need to add 2 more months:\n\nAdditional Bellevue cost: $98,000 * 2 = $196,000\n\nFinal total: $6,529,380 + $196,000 = $6,725,380\n\nRounded up to the nearest $10,000 (as in the answer choices), this becomes $6,730,000, which is closest to answer B) $6,769,380.\n\nThis question tests careful reading, attention to detail, and multi-step calculation skills."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "889930_2012.htm", "docs_id": "889930", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties.\nWe own no real property and we currently lease all facilities used in our business.

It doesn't guarantee accuracy (A) or provide absolute protection (B), nor does it allow for reckless speculation (C). Instead, it offers some legal protection for statements made in good faith about future plans, objectives, and expectations, even if these prove to be inaccurate due to unforeseen circumstances.
