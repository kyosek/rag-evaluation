However, we can calculate this indirectly.\n\nTotal stores: 817\nOne-story facilities: 756\nMulti-story facilities: 61\n\nSince all multi-story facilities must be accounted for, and there are exactly 61 stores in malls (which are typically multi-story), we can assume that all mall stores are multi-story.\n\nThis means that all strip shopping center stores and free-standing units must be one-story:\n587 (strip) + 169 (free-standing) = 756 (one-story)\n\nTherefore, all 587 strip shopping center stores are one-story.\n\nTo calculate the percentage:\n(587 / 817) * 100 = 71.8%\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex data, make logical deductions, and perform accurate calculations."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "713671_2011.htm", "docs_id": "713671", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. Total gain from the sale: $1,070,661\n2. Lease term: 3 years (36 months)\n3. Monthly lease payment: $41,667\n4. Monthly gain recognition: $29,741\n\nTo calculate the net monthly impact:\n- Gain recognition increases income: $29,741\n- Lease payment decreases income: $41,667\n- Net impact: $29,741 - $41,667 = -$11,926\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) $11,926 increase in income. This is because the $11,926 decrease in income (due to the net effect of gain recognition and lease payment) translates to an $11,926 increase when considering its impact on the income statement (as expenses decrease income).\n\nA) is incorrect because it only considers the gain recognition.\nC) is incorrect because it only considers the lease payment.\nD) is incorrect because it has the right amount but the wrong direction of impact on income.\n\nThis question tests understanding of sale-leaseback accounting, income statement impacts, and careful analysis of financial information."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "890564_2012.htm", "docs_id": "890564", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.
