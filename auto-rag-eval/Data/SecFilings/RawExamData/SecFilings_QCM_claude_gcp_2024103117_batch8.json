The $1.7 billion in assets used to secure the debt represents 3.54% of this total ($1.7 billion / $48.0 billion = 0.0354 or 3.54%). This small percentage suggests that the company is efficiently using only a minimal portion of its total assets to secure its debt, which could be interpreted as a sign of financial strength.

Containers: Currently 46,000, increasing by 15%\n   46,000 + (46,000 * 0.15) = 52,900\n\nTotal new assets: 14 + 1,663 + 52,900 = 54,747\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform percentage calculations, and combine multiple elements to arrive at a final answer.
