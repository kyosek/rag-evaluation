Add this increase for 5 years: $3,778 + (5 * $113.34) = $4,344.70\n3. Add one more month's worth of increase (1/12 of $113.34) = $9.45\n4.

The text states that as of December 31, 2019, the company owned an office in Kitchener, Ontario, and leased approximately 250 other office locations under various leases with varying terms. Additionally, it mentions that other office locations are occupied under various short-term rental arrangements. This combination of owned property, leased locations with varying terms, and short-term rentals is only fully captured in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the company owned multiple offices (when only one is mentioned) and that lease terms were uniform (when the text specifies \"varying terms\").\n\nOption C is incorrect because it fails to mention the owned office in Kitchener and incorrectly states that the company exclusively relied on leased properties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it overstates the number of owned offices and incorrectly suggests that all leased locations had long-term commitments, which contradicts the information about varying lease terms and short-term rental arrangements."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "929061_1996.txt", "docs_id": "929061", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "Item 8.

The text states that \"The current facilities are rented on a month to month basis for approximately $15,622 per month.\" However, it mentions two temporary locations: one for headquarters and one for manufacturing/warehouse. This implies that $15,622 is the rent for each location, making the total $31,244 ($15,622 x 2). The former rent at 106 Cattlemen Road was \"approximately $10,445\" per month. $31,244 is about three times $10,445, making option B the correct answer.
