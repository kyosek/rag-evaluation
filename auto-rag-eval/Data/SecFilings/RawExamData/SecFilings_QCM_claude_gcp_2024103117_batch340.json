The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. In 2004, the company spent $6.7 million on leases, including $1.1 million on short-term rentals.\n2. In 2005, they expanded a warehouse at an increased cost of $1.2 million.\n3.

The short-term rental cost in 2004 was $1.1 million, which is very close to the increased cost of $1.2 million.\n\nGiven that the increase is \"substantially offset,\" it's reasonable to infer that the total property expenses will remain roughly the same. The slight difference between the $1.2 million increase and the $1.1 million offset could be accounted for by the term \"substantially,\" suggesting the expenses might be very close to the previous year's total.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they suggest significant changes in expenses that are not supported by the information provided.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that although Saia owns only 40% of its service facility locations, these owned locations account for 54% of its door capacity. This aligns with their strategy of owning strategically-located facilities integral to operations while leasing in smaller markets for flexibility.
