The documentation states that the company owns and occupies approximately 263,000 square feet of space at their San Jose headquarters, which is indeed the largest owned facility mentioned in the text.\n\nOption C is incorrect. While the company does operate test facilities in both Malaysia and Singapore, the Malaysian facility is subject to ground leases and the Singapore facility is subject to a leased space arrangement. They are not fully owned properties.\n\nOption D is incorrect.

Additionally, the Bank owns a property at 51 North Clay Street in Millersburg that is planned to be developed for a new operations center.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Bank does not own all of its branch locations; some are leased.\nOption B is incorrect because the main office is in Millersburg, not Sugarcreek, and the total number of branches is 7, not 10.\nOption D is incorrect because the Bank owns 7 properties (including the main office) and leases 3 branch locations (not including the Operations Center), and there are no mentioned plans for a new main office.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully analyze and synthesize information from a complex set of data about property ownership and leasing arrangements."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1139812_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1139812", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nWe conduct our business at 86 banking offices located in the Chicago metropolitan area and one banking office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
