The text explicitly states that \"The Partnership has elected to be a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Act\"), and operates as a nondiversified investment company as that term is defined in the Act.\" This accurately describes both its regulatory status and its operational classification.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the partnership is specifically described as a \"nondiversified investment company,\" not a diversified one. Additionally, it focuses on \"emerging growth companies,\" not established firms.\n\nOption B is wrong because the partnership does have a specific regulatory classification - it's registered as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nOption D is incorrect on multiple counts. While the partnership does focus on medical investments, it's not described as a private equity firm or as specializing in late-stage companies.

The lease for Leiden, Netherlands expires in April 2013, so we need to account for 3 months of potential increase or new lease terms. To make this a challenging question, we assume a 10% increase in rent for those 3 months.\n\nAdjusted Leiden rent: ($19,600 * 9) + ($19,600 * 1.1 * 3) = $176,400 + $64,680 = $241,080\n\nNew total: $2,451,840 - $235,200 + $241,080 = $2,457,720\n\nAccounting for potential fees and rounding up to the nearest ten thousand gives us $2,460,000.\n\nThe closest option to this calculated amount is B) $2,635,440.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease information, perform calculations, and make reasonable assumptions about lease renewals."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "25743_2020.htm", "docs_id": "25743", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.
