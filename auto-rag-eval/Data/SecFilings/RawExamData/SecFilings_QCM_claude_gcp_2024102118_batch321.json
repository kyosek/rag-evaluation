According to the passage, \"As of August 31, 1997, the leases had an average remaining term of 38 months, exclusive of option terms.\" This directly corresponds to the first part of answer B. For the second part, the passage states, \"Annual rents on such retail units range from $2,400 to $74,500.\" The maximum value in this range is $74,500, which matches the second part of answer B. \n\nOptions A, C, and D contain plausible but incorrect values for both the lease term and maximum rent, requiring students to be precise in their reading and recall of the information provided in the passage."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "98537_1997.txt", "docs_id": "98537", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

If the Navy requires a vessel weighing 18,000 tons to be serviced, which of the following statements is correct regarding the company's ability to handle this job?\n\nA) The company can use the Emerald Sea drydock, as its design capacity of 40,000 tons exceeds the vessel's weight.\nB) The company cannot service the vessel because none of its drydocks have a Navy certification that meets or exceeds 18,000 tons.\nC) The company can use the YFD-70 drydock, as its design capacity of 17,500 tons is close enough to the vessel's weight.\nD) The company can use the Emerald Sea drydock, as its Navy certification of 30,000 tons allows for servicing vessels up to that weight.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the difference between design capacity and Navy certification, as well as the importance of certification in qualifying for Navy contracts. While the Emerald Sea drydock has a design capacity of 40,000 tons, its Navy certification is only 30,000 tons. The YFD-70 has a design capacity of 17,500 tons but is certified for only 14,000 tons. The wood drydock YFD-54 is too small for consideration. The question specifically asks about a Navy vessel, and the documentation states that Navy certification is required to qualify for Navy contracts. Since none of the drydocks have a Navy certification that meets or exceeds 18,000 tons, the company cannot service this vessel for the Navy, making option B the correct answer."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1447028_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1447028", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.
