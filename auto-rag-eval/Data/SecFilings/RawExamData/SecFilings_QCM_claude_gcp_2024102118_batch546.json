The company's headquarters in Plainview, NY is 8,700 square feet with an annual rent of $65,000. The Tampa, FL location is 11,700 square feet with an annual rent of $119,000. \n\nTo compare these fairly, we need to calculate the cost per square foot:\n\nPlainview, NY: $65,000 / 8,700 sq ft = $7.47 per sq ft\nTampa, FL: $119,000 / 11,700 sq ft = $10.17 per sq ft\n\nAs we can see, the cost per square foot is actually higher in Tampa. If the company moved to a similarly sized space (8,700 sq ft) in Tampa at the same rate, the cost would be:\n\n8,700 sq ft * $10.17 per sq ft = $88,479\n\nThis is more expensive than their current location, so there would be no cost savings.

The company primarily relies on leased properties (67 out of 71 warehouse distribution centers are leased), and many leases contain change in control provisions that could be triggered by a merger. However, the company believes these provisions won't have a material adverse effect due to good landlord relations, market-rate leases, and a history of securing suitable properties when needed. This indicates a moderate risk that is mitigated by market factors and the company's track record.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company owns only 4 out of 71 distribution centers, not the majority. \n\nOption B is too extreme, as the company explicitly states that they don't believe these provisions will have a material adverse effect.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the principal executive office is leased, not owned, and the lease expiration in 2010 does not necessarily provide stability beyond that date."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "899460_2008.htm", "docs_id": "899460", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.
