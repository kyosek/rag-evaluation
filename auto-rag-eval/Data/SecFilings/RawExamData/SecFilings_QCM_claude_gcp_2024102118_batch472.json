The Company's capacity to fabricate all of the parts needed to build the buses is a constraint as the Company's present fabrication facilities have the capacity to support the production of approximately 25,000 units per year. With an investement of approximately $2.5 million in additional equipment, Blue Bird's fabrication capacity could support approxiamtely 28,500 units per year.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Blue Bird operates seven facilities across North America. If the company were to invest $2.5 million in additional equipment to maximize its fabrication capacity, what would be the difference between its maximum assembly capacity and its new fabrication capacity?\n\nA) 0 units\nB) 1,200 units\nC) 2,300 units\nD) 3,300 units\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 1,200 units\n\nExplanation: \nThe question requires several steps of analysis:\n\n1. The current maximum assembly capacity is 27,300 units per year (operating at \"maximum capacity\" as defined in the text).\n\n2. The current fabrication capacity is 25,000 units per year.\n\n3. With a $2.5 million investment, the fabrication capacity could increase to 28,500 units per year.\n\n4. The question asks for the difference between the maximum assembly capacity (which remains unchanged at 27,300) and the new fabrication capacity (28,500).\n\n5. 28,500 - 27,300 = 1,200 units\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 1,200 units. This represents the number of units by which the new fabrication capacity would exceed the maximum assembly capacity after the investment."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "935418_1999.txt", "docs_id": "935418", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.
