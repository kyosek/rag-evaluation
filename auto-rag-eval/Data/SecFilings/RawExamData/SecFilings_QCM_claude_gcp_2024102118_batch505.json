Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. The company has 143 consolidated properties and 5 properties in an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling 148 properties.\n\n2. The footnotes mention three types of consolidated joint ventures:\n   - 90% controlling interest (Footnote 1)\n   - 95% controlling interest (Footnote 2)\n   - 75% controlling interest (Footnote 3)\n\n3. The company wants to sell all properties where it holds less than a 95% controlling interest.\n\n4. We don't know exactly how many properties fall under each joint venture category, but we know there's at least one property in each (90% and 75%) that would need to be sold.\n\n5. The 5 properties in the unconsolidated joint venture would also likely be sold, as the company probably holds less than a 95% interest (otherwise, they would likely be consolidated).\n\n6. Therefore, the minimum number of properties that would be sold is 1 (90% JV) + 1 (75% JV) + 5 (unconsolidated JV) = 7 properties.\n\n7. The maximum number of properties the company could retain is 148 - 7 = 141.\n\n8. However, the question asks for the maximum number of properties it could retain, so we need to account for the possibility that only one property each is in the 90% and 75% joint ventures. This means the company could potentially retain up to 142 properties (all 143 consolidated properties except for the two in the <95% joint ventures).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of properties the company could retain is 142, making B the correct answer."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "1017303_2006.txt", "docs_id": "1017303", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.
