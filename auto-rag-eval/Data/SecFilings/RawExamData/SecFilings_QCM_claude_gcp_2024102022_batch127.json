PROPERTIES - ------------------- The executive offices of Cullen/Frost, as well as the principal banking quarters of Frost Bank, are housed in a 21-story office tower located on approximately two acres of land in downtown San Antonio. Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank lease approximately 50 percent of the office tower. Frost Bank also leases space in a seven-story parking garage and a nine-story office building adjacent to the banking quarters.\nIn June 1987 Frost Bank consummated the sale of its office tower and leased back a portion of the premises under a 13-year primary lease term with options allowing for occupancy up to 50 years. The Bank also sold its related parking garage facility and leased back space in that structure under a 12-year primary lease term with options allowing for occupancy up to 50 years.\nThe principal offices of Frost Bank in Houston are located in downtown Houston with leased facilities in three buildings within the Cullen Center complex. The remainder of the subsidiary banks located in Dallas and Galveston are housed in modern facilities which, together with tracts of adjacent land used for parking and drive-in facilities, are either owned or leased by the particular subsidiary bank.\nItem 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Cullen/Frost's real estate strategy for its main operations involves which of the following complex arrangements?\n\nA) Full ownership of all properties with no leasing agreements\nB) A mix of owned and leased properties, with some sale-leaseback arrangements and long-term occupancy options\nC) Short-term leases across all locations with no ownership\nD) Exclusive use of build-to-suit properties constructed specifically for the company\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the text describes a complex mix of real estate arrangements for Cullen/Frost and its subsidiary Frost Bank. Key points supporting this:\n\n1. They lease approximately 50% of a 21-story office tower in downtown San Antonio.\n2. In 1987, Frost Bank sold its office tower and parking garage, then leased back portions under long-term agreements (13 and 12 years respectively) with options for up to 50 years of occupancy.\n3. In Houston, they have leased facilities in three buildings.\n4. Other subsidiary banks in Dallas and Galveston use a mix of owned and leased facilities.\n\nThis combination of owned properties, leased spaces, sale-leaseback arrangements, and long-term occupancy options demonstrates a complex and varied real estate strategy, making B the most accurate answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because they clearly lease many properties. Option C is wrong because they own some properties and have long-term leases, not just short-term. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of build-to-suit properties, and they clearly use existing buildings in many locations."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "914712_2005.htm", "docs_id": "914712", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.-PROPERTIES\nAt September 30, 2005, the Company\u2019s various properties in the Americas, Asia and Europe utilized for office, storage, warehouse, production and assembly, sales and marketing, and operations facilities include the following locations:\n(1) Includes approximately 300,000 square feet not currently being utilized by the Company.\n(2) Includes approximately 415,000 square feet not currently being utilized by the Company.\n(3) Includes approximately 135,000 square feet located in a building owned by the Company.\n(4) Includes approximately 62,000 from which the Company is in the process of transitioning operations.\n(5) Includes approximately 168,000 square feet located in a building owned by the Company, and approximately 129,000 square feet of land on which that building is located, which is leased through 2088.\nThe Company\u2019s leases generally expire at varying dates through fiscal year 2013 and include renewals at our option.
