The documentation states, \"The transaction did not have a significant immediate impact on the Company's financial statements as the resultant net gain on sale will be recognized over the 10 year term of the leases as a reduction of rent expense.\" This means that the gain from the sale (the difference between the net proceeds and the net book value) will not be recognized immediately, but rather spread out over the 10-year lease term, effectively reducing the rent expense each year. This accounting treatment aligns with generally accepted accounting principles for sale and leaseback transactions where the seller becomes the lessee.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the gain is not recognized immediately.

The document states that at December 31, 2010, the Bank occupied premises for 48 Business Financial and Commercial Banking Centers. Of these, 41 were under leases.

BUSINESS.\nOVERVIEW\nVista Gold Corp. (the \"Corporation\") is currently engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and improvement of gold exploration and potential development projects. The Corporation's approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining, land ownership and tax laws, which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third-party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material. In addition, the Corporation looks for opportunities to improve the value of its gold projects through exploration drilling, and/or introducing technological innovations. The Corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition and improvement will continue in the future.\nCurrently the Corporation owns or controls six gold properties: the Maverick Springs and Mountain View projects and the Hycroft mine, all in Nevada; the Long Valley project in east central Califorina; the Paredones Amarillos project in Baja, Mexico; and the Amayapampa project in Bolivia.
