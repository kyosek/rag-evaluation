Pre-engineered steel building: 11,770 sq ft\nTotal owned (X) = 23,000 + 11,770 = 34,770 sq ft\n\nLeased facilities:\n14 facilities totaling approximately 113,000 sq ft\n\nTotal leased (Y) = 113,000 sq ft\n\nRatio X:Y = 34,770 : 113,000\nSimplifying this ratio:\n34,770 : 113,000 \u2248 1 : 3.25\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 1:3.25.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform calculations, and simplify ratios.
