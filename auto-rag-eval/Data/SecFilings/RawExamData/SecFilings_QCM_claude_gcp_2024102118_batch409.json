The documentation clearly states that the company owns sales offices and warehouse facilities for its Crane segment in Northhampton, England, Dole, France, and Rouen, France. It also mentions leasing facilities in many other European countries, as well as in Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and the Americas for the Crane segment. For the Foodservice segment, it mentions leasing facilities in Salem, Virginia; Irwindale, California; and Ecully, France. This combination of owned and leased properties across different regions makes C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it falsely claims all facilities in France are leased, when in fact some are owned. Option B is incorrect because it wrongly states that all European facilities are owned, when many are leased.
