What is the approximate cost per square foot per month for this new lease, and how does it compare to their previous lease?\n\nA) $3.00 per square foot, which is about 82% less expensive than the previous lease\nB) $3.00 per square foot, which is about 55% less expensive than the previous lease\nC) $3.50 per square foot, which is about 72% less expensive than the previous lease\nD) $3.50 per square foot, which is about 45% less expensive than the previous lease\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe new lease is for 2,500 square feet at $7,500 per month. This calculates to $3.00 per square foot ($7,500 / 2,500 = $3.00).\n\nThe previous lease was $41,890 per month, but the square footage isn't provided. However, we can calculate the cost per square foot of the previous lease if we assume it was for the same 2,500 square feet:\n\n$41,890 / 2,500 = $16.76 per square foot\n\nThe difference between $16.76 and $3.00 is $13.76, which represents an 82% decrease:\n\n($13.76 / $16.76) * 100 = 82.1%\n\nTherefore, the new lease is approximately 82% less expensive per square foot than the previous lease, making option A the correct answer.\n\nThis question tests the ability to perform multiple calculations, make assumptions based on available data, and compare relative costs, making it a challenging multi-step problem."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "66388_2011.htm", "docs_id": "66388", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements and supplementary financial schedules are attached as an exhibit to this report.

This represents 21.05% of the total 190,000 square foot facility (40,000 / 190,000 = 0.2105 or 21.05%).\n\nThe Company owns 12 acres at the headquarters location and 16.4 acres at the Newberry facility, totaling 28.4 acres. The 40,000 square feet dedicated space is equivalent to 0.918 acres (40,000 sq ft / 43,560 sq ft per acre). This represents 3.23% of the total owned acreage (0.918 / 28.4 = 0.0323 or 3.23%).\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between the dedicated space and total owned acreage, which is 13.89% (40,000 sq ft / (28.4 acres * 43,560 sq ft per acre) = 0.1389 or 13.89%).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, which accurately states both the percentage of the headquarters facility (21.05%) and the relationship to total owned acreage (13.89%)."}}
