The documentation states that the Company subleases its New York office (2,000 square feet) from Amanasu Environment Corporation, which is controlled by the Company's majority shareholder, making it a related party. The lease is on a month-to-month basis.

Option B is incorrect because the New York office is subleased, not from a subsidiary, and the Tokyo office lease is not described as long-term.
