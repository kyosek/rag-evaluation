Based on the information provided, what is the maximum amount of square footage the company could potentially occupy in owned facilities in this region?\n\nA) 131,000 square feet\nB) 262,000 square feet\nC) 342,000 square feet\nD) 393,000 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: A) 131,000 square feet\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful analysis of the given information. The passage states that the Southern California operations consist of \"five facilities owned by us and five leased facilities\" out of a total of \"ten buildings aggregating approximately 262,000 square feet.\" Since exactly half of the facilities are owned, we can assume that approximately half of the total square footage is owned. Therefore, the maximum amount of square footage in owned facilities would be around 131,000 square feet (262,000 \u00f7 2).\n\nOption B is incorrect because it represents the total square footage of all facilities, both owned and leased. Option C is incorrect as it exceeds the total square footage mentioned. Option D is incorrect as it includes square footage from other locations mentioned in the passage (e.g., Florida, Costa Rica) which are not part of the Southern California operations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "798363_1994.txt", "docs_id": "798363", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1994", "text": "ITEM 2.
