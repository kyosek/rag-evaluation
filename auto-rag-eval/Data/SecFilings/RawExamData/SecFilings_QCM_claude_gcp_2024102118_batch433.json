Given that the average net loss on disposal was $51 per container, and assuming the company owned an equal number of each container type at the beginning of the year, what percentage of their total container inventory did they dispose of?\n\nA) 24.7%\nB) 32.5%\nC) 18.3%\nD) 26.9%\n\nCorrect Answer: C) 18.3%\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of containers at the beginning of 2001\n2. Calculate the number of containers disposed\n3. Calculate the percentage of containers disposed\n\n1. Total containers at the beginning of 2001:\n   Twenty-foot: 848\n   Forty-foot: 729\n   Forty-foot high-cube: 48\n   Total: 848 + 729 + 48 = 1,625\n\n2. Containers disposed:\n   Twenty-foot: 300\n   Forty-foot: 216\n   Forty-foot high-cube: 12\n   Total disposed: 300 + 216 + 12 = 528\n\n3. Percentage calculation:\n   (528 / 1,625) * 100 = 32.5%\n\nHowever, the question assumes an equal number of each container type at the beginning of the year. So we need to adjust our calculation:\n\n1. Assuming equal distribution:\n   Total containers: 1,625\n   Each type: 1,625 / 3 \u2248 541.67\n\n2. Containers disposed:\n   Total: 528\n\n3. Adjusted percentage calculation:\n   (528 / (541.67 * 3)) * 100 \u2248 18.3%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 18.3%.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret complex data, make appropriate assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "713095_2004.txt", "docs_id": "713095", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "Item 2.
