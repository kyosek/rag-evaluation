The Company leases its principal executive offices in Coudersport from Adelphia and also leases offices in Pittsburgh. It owns its NOCC (Network Operations Control Center) facilities. The fiber optic cable is primarily located on or under public roads, highways, or streets, which implies the use of public rights-of-way. This answer combines these key points accurately.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Company does not own all its office spaces and network facilities. It leases some offices and uses public rights-of-way for much of its network.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it reverses the ownership and leasing arrangements. The Company leases its executive offices, not owns them, and owns its NOCC facilities, not leases them.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it overstates the Company's reliance on leasing. While the Company does lease some properties from Adelphia, it doesn't lease all its properties, and it owns some facilities like the NOCC."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "77449_2003.txt", "docs_id": "77449", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2 PROPERTIES\nThe Company owns its five-story, approximately 300,000 square foot corporate headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The information provided indicates that the company owns the majority of its store locations (343 out of 629) while leasing a smaller portion (286). For administrative offices, the company owns its large corporate headquarters and two regional offices, while leasing two other regional offices.

The company owns more stores than it leases, and the split for administrative offices isn't even either.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no information provided about the company owning all warehouse spaces or actively expanding storage capacity.
