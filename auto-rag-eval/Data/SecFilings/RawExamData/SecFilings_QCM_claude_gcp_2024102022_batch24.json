The passage states that ISP owns some properties (like the corporate headquarters, though it's subject to a mortgage) and leases others (particularly sales offices and warehouses under short-term leases). Additionally, the document mentions that ISP made capital expenditures of $54.0 million relating to plant, property, and equipment in 1996, indicating significant investments in its facilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all properties are owned outright (some are leased), and the capital expenditures are not solely for property acquisition.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the corporate headquarters, while owned, is subject to a first mortgage and thus not unencumbered.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ISP does own some properties (not all are leased), and the $54.0 million was for capital expenditures, not lease payments."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "849399_2001.txt", "docs_id": "849399", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nOur principal locations, all of which are leased, are as follows:\nOur principal administrative, sales and marketing facilities are located in Cupertino, California.

We know there are 18 manufacturing facilities in total, with 10 in the U.S. and 8 outside the U.S.\n3.

This is the straight-line rent recognition for the corporate headquarters, but it's not the total lease-related expense for 2014.\n\nB) $46,604 is correct. The documentation states that \"The present value of the remaining lease payments of $46,604 was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2014\" for the Lawrenceburg facility that was vacated. This is the only specific lease expense mentioned for 2014.\n\nC) $117,852 is incorrect. This might be derived from multiplying the monthly straight-line rent of $9,821 by 12 months, but it doesn't account for the Lawrenceburg lease expense and there's no indication that this full amount was expensed in 2014.\n\nD) $143,604 is incorrect. This could be calculated by adding the annual rent for the headquarters ($117,852) and the Lawrenceburg lease expense ($46,604), but it's not accurate because the question asks specifically about recognized expenses in 2014, and there's no indication that the full annual rent for the headquarters was expensed.\n\nThe question tests the ability to identify and focus on the specific financial information provided for the year in question, rather than being misled by other figures in the text."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "858558_2001.txt", "docs_id": "858558", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2.
