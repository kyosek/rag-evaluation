The information provided states that out of 33 total banking centers, the company owns 15 and leases 18, meaning they own less than half. It also mentions a new facility constructed in Watertown, South Dakota in fiscal 2009. Additionally, the document explicitly states that \"Management believes there is a continuing need to keep facilities and equipment up-to-date and continued investment will be necessary in the future.\" This aligns perfectly with the statement in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does not own all 33 centers (it owns 15 and leases 18). \n\nOption B is incorrect because the company does not lease the majority (it leases 18 out of 33) and it does believe further investment is necessary.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company does have an Internet branch, there's no indication that it operates primarily through this channel or plans to reduce its physical presence.
