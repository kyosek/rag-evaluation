The lease for the Aliso Viejo facility commenced on December 1, 2005.\n2. The annual base rent increases to $1.4 million on December 1, 2008.\n3. The base rent is increased by 3% annually, effective on December 1 of each year.\n\nTo calculate the rent for 2009:\n1. Start with the $1.4 million base rent effective December 1, 2008.\n2. Apply the 3% increase on December 1, 2008: $1,400,000 * 1.03 = $1,442,000\n3.
