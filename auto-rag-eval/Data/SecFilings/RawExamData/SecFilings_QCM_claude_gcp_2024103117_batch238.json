A 66.67% interest in Bellevue Plaza Partners for $1,500,000 in October 1988.\n2. A 50% interest in DR/US West End General Partnership for an initial contribution of $900,000 in November 1988.\n\nThe total initial investment was therefore $1,500,000 + $900,000 = $2,400,000.\n\nTo retain its 50% interest in the DR/US Joint Venture, the partnership had to contribute an additional $1,035,000 by August 1989.\n\nOption A correctly combines these figures.
