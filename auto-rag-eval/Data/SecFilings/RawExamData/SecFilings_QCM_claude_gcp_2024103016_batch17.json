The question requires synthesizing multiple pieces of information from the text and making logical inferences. The key points supporting this answer are:\n\n1. The leases vary in term, generally lasting up to 16 years, indicating a mix of lease durations.\n2. Several leases contain renewal provisions, suggesting flexibility.\n3. The projected rent for fiscal 2005 is substantially the same as 2004, indicating relative stability in expenses.\n4.

Calculate the rent reduction based on that percentage\n\nTotal square footage:\n16,000 + 8,800 + 6,000 + 6,400 = 37,200 sq ft\n\nPhoenix location: 8,800 sq ft\nPercentage of total: 8,800 / 37,200 = 0.236 or 23.6%\n\nAnnual rent: $248,160\nRent reduction: $248,160 * 0.236 = $58,565.76\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar, this equals $58,565, which is option B."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "875729_2011.htm", "docs_id": "875729", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "ITEM 2.
