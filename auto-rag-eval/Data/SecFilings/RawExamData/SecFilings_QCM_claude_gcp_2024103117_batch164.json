The document states that approximately 9,600 square feet is leased to eight unaffiliated tenants. This represents 30% of the total square footage (9,600 / 32,000 = 0.3 or 30%).\n\nThe unaffiliated tenants paid $204,690 in rent during 1995. To calculate the annual rent per square foot:\n$204,690 / 9,600 sq ft = $21.32 per sq ft\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 32%, $21.32 per sq ft.
