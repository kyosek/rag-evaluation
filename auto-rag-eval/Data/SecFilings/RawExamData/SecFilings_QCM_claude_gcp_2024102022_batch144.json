If the Company decided to build a second pipeline alongside the existing one, which of the following statements would be most accurate regarding their legal right to do so?\n\nA) The Company would need to negotiate entirely new agreements for the second pipeline, as their current agreements only cover the existing pipeline.\n\nB) The Company has no legal right to build a second pipeline without purchasing additional land along the entire 78-mile route.\n\nC) The Company already possesses the necessary legal agreements to build a second pipeline on property contiguous to the Kiantone Pipeline.\n\nD) The Company would need to extend the length of their current 265 separate agreements before constructing a second pipeline.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explicitly states: \"The Company also has easements, right-of-way agreements, leases, permits and similar agreements which would enable the Company to build a second pipeline on property contiguous to the Kiantone Pipeline.\" This indicates that the Company already possesses the legal rights to construct a second pipeline alongside the existing one without needing to negotiate new agreements or purchase additional land.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company already has agreements in place for a potential second pipeline. Option B is wrong as the Company doesn't need to purchase additional land.
