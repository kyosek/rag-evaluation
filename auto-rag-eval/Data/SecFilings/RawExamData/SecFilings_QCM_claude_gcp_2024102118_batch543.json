The information provided indicates that SecFilings was actively reducing its office space footprint while extending its commitment in San Francisco. This is evidenced by several key points:\n\n1. In the third quarter of 2014, the company exited approximately 31,000 square feet of office space in San Francisco and 9,000 square feet in Boston as part of a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities and reduce costs.\n\n2.

The Company owned 187 self-storage facilities outright, containing approximately 9,894,000 net rentable square feet. Additionally, it had joint venture interests in two more facilities (15% ownership in one and 25% in another).
