The total cost of owned assets and capitalized leases was $41.7 billion, while accumulated depreciation was $20.7 billion. To find the net book value, we subtract accumulated depreciation from the total cost: $41.7 billion - $20.7 billion = $21.0 billion. This represents the net book value.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of the original cost, we divide the net book value by the total cost: $21.0 billion / $41.7 billion = 0.504, or 50.4%.\n\nOption B is correct because it accurately states both the net book value ($21.0 billion) and the percentage of original cost (50.4%).\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect:\nA) Uses the accumulated depreciation figure instead of net book value.\nC) Uses the total cost figure without accounting for depreciation.\nD) Adds the total cost and accumulated depreciation, which is not a meaningful figure in this context."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "104894_2006.htm", "docs_id": "104894", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "ITEM 2.

Of these stores, 43 are owned with a net book value for land and buildings of $83.6 million, and 18 leased locations have a net book value of $60.2 million on the balance sheet.

Calculate the total net book value: $83.6 million + $60.2 million = $143.8 million\n2. Estimate the total square footage for the 61 stores: (4.5 million sq ft / 124 stores) * 61 stores = 2,214,516 sq ft\n3. Divide the total net book value by the estimated square footage: $143,800,000 / 2,214,516 sq ft = $32.84 per square foot\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations.
