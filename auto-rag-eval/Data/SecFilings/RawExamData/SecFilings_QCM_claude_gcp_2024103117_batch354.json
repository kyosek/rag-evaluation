The documentation clearly states: \"The Company previously subleased an additional 60,800 square feet in Oakland which the Company does not plan to occupy and has subleased to a third-party through June 2000.\" This indicates that the company is not using this additional space and has subleased it to another party until the lease expires in June 2000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company explicitly states it does not plan to occupy this space. Option B is wrong as the company is not using the space for any purpose. Option D is incorrect because the company hasn't terminated the lease; instead, it has subleased the space to a third party until the lease expires.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret detailed property information in corporate filings, which is an important skill in financial analysis and real estate management."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1057693_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1057693", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.
