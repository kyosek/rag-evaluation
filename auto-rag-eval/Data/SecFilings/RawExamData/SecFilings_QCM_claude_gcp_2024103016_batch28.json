The document states that in December 1998, the branch location in Algonquin was closed.

The 2004 expansion added 2,000 square feet at a cost of $260,000 for construction and $40,000 for furnishings.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Original cost (including furnishings): $1.7 million\n2. 2004 expansion construction: $260,000\n3. 2004 expansion furnishings: $40,000\n\nThe key is to recognize that all furniture and equipment were taken by the FDIC, so we need to exclude those costs. The original $1.7 million included furnishings, but we don't know their exact value. However, we can assume that the building structure and landscaping represent the majority of this cost.\n\nFor the 2004 expansion, we can clearly separate the construction cost ($260,000) from the furnishing cost ($40,000).\n\nTherefore, the total investment in the building structure and landscaping is:\n$1.7 million + $260,000 = $1.96 million\n\nThis makes option B the correct answer, as it represents the closest approximation of the investment in the building's structure and landscaping, excluding all furniture and equipment."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "1253317_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1253317", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.

If the trend continues at the same rate, what would be the approximate total annual rent paid to both Bancorp and Richardson in 2005, assuming no changes in the lease agreements?\n\nA) $395,000\nB) $430,000\nC) $465,000\nD) $500,000\n\nCorrect Answer: C) $465,000\n\nExplanation: The question requires several steps of analysis:\n\n1. Identify the rent paid to Bancorp:\n   2001: $137,000\n   2002: $183,000\n   2003: $244,000\n\n2. Identify the rent paid to Richardson:\n   2002: $53,000\n   2003: $42,500\n\n3. Calculate the total rent for 2002 and 2003:\n   2002: $183,000 + $53,000 = $236,000\n   2003: $244,000 + $42,500 = $286,500\n\n4. Calculate the annual increase:\n   $286,500 - $236,000 = $50,500 per year\n\n5. Project this increase for two more years:\n   2004: $286,500 + $50,500 = $337,000\n   2005: $337,000 + $50,500 = $387,500\n\n6. Add the suburban office space rent:\n   $387,500 + $10,000 = $397,500\n\n7.
