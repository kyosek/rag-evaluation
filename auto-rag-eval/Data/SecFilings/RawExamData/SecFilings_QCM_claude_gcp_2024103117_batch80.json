The passage explicitly states that \"The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.\" However, it also mentions that these statements involve \"risks and uncertainties\" and that actual results may differ from predictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that forward-looking statements are guarantees, but rather that they are based on management's plans and assumptions.\n\nOption B is the opposite of what the passage states. The SEC encourages, not discourages, forward-looking statements.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage clearly distinguishes forward-looking statements from historical facts, stating \"Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.\""}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1111928_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1111928", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur main facilities at December 31, 2010 include the following:\n*\nSubject to ongoing renewal discussions.\nWe maintain our corporate headquarters in Oxford, Massachusetts, and conduct research and development in Oxford, Massachusetts, Burbach, Germany and Fryazino, Russia.

The total leased space for Elgar's operations in San Diego is 118,000 sq ft (87,300 + 14,600 + 7,100 + 9,100). The space dedicated to standard DC/AC products, CASS Program, and administrative headquarters is 87,300 sq ft. To calculate the percentage: (87,300 / 118,000) * 100 = 74%. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 118,000 sq ft total, with 74% dedicated to the specified purposes. Options A and B are incorrect in either total space or percentage.
