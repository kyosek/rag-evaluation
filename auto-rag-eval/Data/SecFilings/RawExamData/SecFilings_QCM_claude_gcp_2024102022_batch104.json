As of February 29, 2012, the rent was $10,290 per month, but the document states that for the next 12 months (from that date), the anticipated rent is $123,480.\n\nThis implies a slight increase:\n$123,480 / 12 = $10,290 per month\n\nTo be conservative and account for this increase, we'll use the $123,480 annual figure for our calculation:\n\n$123,480 * 6 years = $740,880\n\nOption C ($1,482,960) is the closest to this calculated amount, allowing for potential small increases over the 6-year period that aren't explicitly stated in the given information.\n\nOptions A and B are too low, not accounting for the full 6-year period.
