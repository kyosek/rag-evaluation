Properties\nOur production facility is located at 815-D Virginia Street in Lenoir, North Carolina. The property occupies approximately 18,000 square feet and is leased from Neptune, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (\u201cNeptune\u201d). The Company executed the lease on April 1, 2007 and the lease expired on May 31, 2012. The lease automatically renewed for a five year term as neither party opted out or expressed any conditions that were not mutually agreed to by the parties. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we are obligated to pay only the real and personal property taxes on the facility as rental payments. Additionally, we have a right of first refusal to purchase the property from Neptune if Neptune chooses to sell the property at any time during term of the lease. Our property taxes for 2014 (which includes city and county taxes) were $2,729 and have been paid in full. The foregoing description constitutes all of the material terms of the lease agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.7, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Company currently owns the process equipment utilized at its biodiesel production plant as well as the lab equipment used in testing.\nItem 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company leases its production facility from Neptune, Inc. The lease agreement includes several unique provisions. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the terms of this lease agreement?\n\nA) The company pays a fixed monthly rent and has the option to purchase the property at fair market value at any time during the lease term.\n\nB) The lease automatically renewed for a 10-year term after its initial expiration, and the company is responsible for all maintenance and repairs.\n\nC) The company's sole rental obligation is to pay the real and personal property taxes on the facility, and it has a right of first refusal if Neptune decides to sell the property.\n\nD) The lease agreement requires the company to pay both property taxes and a percentage of its gross revenue as rent, with no option to purchase the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, the company's lease agreement with Neptune, Inc. has two key provisions that match this option:\n\n1. The company is obligated to pay only the real and personal property taxes on the facility as rental payments.\n2. The company has a right of first refusal to purchase the property if Neptune chooses to sell it during the lease term.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of a fixed monthly rent or an option to purchase at fair market value at any time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the lease renewed for a 5-year term, not 10 years, and there's no mention of maintenance and repair responsibilities.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the company doesn't pay a percentage of gross revenue as rent, and it does have a purchase option (right of first refusal).\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease terms, distinguishing between accurate and inaccurate statements about the agreement."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "897708_1995.txt", "docs_id": "897708", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "ITEM 2.
