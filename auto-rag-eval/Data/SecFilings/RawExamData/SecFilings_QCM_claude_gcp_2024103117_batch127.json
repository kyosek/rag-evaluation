If the company decides to terminate its lease in Aurora, Colorado and relocate those operations to expand its New York switching facility by an additional 5,600 square feet (assuming the same price per square foot as the current New York facility), what would be the approximate net annual impact on the company's total leasing expenses?\n\nA) Decrease of $29,400\nB) Increase of $36,200\nC) Decrease of $95,000\nD) Increase of $131,200\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the current cost per square foot for the New York switching facility.\n2. Determine the cost of adding 5,600 square feet to the New York facility.\n3. Compare this cost to the savings from terminating the Aurora lease.\n\nSteps:\n1. The company leases a total of 8,500 square feet across New York, Los Angeles, and Denver for $199,000 annually. Assuming an equal distribution, the New York facility would be about 2,833 square feet (8,500 \u00f7 3). \n   Cost per square foot in New York = $199,000 \u00f7 8,500 = $23.41/sq ft\n\n2. Cost of additional 5,600 sq ft in New York = 5,600 \u00d7 $23.41 = $131,200\n\n3. Current annual cost of Aurora lease = $95,000\n   Net impact = New cost - Savings = $131,200 - $95,000 = $36,200 increase\n\nTherefore, the company would face an approximate net annual increase of $36,200 in leasing expenses."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1454124_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1454124", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 1.

To equalize distribution, each state would need 31 branches (93 \u00f7 3 = 31).\n\nTo achieve this:\n- Washington would lose 32 branches (63 - 31 = 32)\n- Oregon would gain 10 branches (31 - 21 = 10)\n- Idaho would gain 22 branches (31 - 9 = 22)\n\nThe total number of branches that need to be relocated is the sum of the absolute changes: 32 + 10 + 22 = 64. However, since branches moving out of Washington can directly fill the needs in Oregon and Idaho, we only need to move 32 branches out of Washington, with 10 going to Oregon and 22 to Idaho.\n\nTherefore, 38 branches in total need to be relocated (32 out of Washington, 6 of which go to Oregon, and all 22 needed in Idaho).
