This statement is a common disclaimer in financial reporting that acknowledges the limitations of quarterly data. It suggests that quarterly results may be influenced by factors such as seasonal trends, one-time events, or short-term market conditions that may not accurately represent the company's long-term financial health or performance trends.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because quarterly results are not irrelevant; they still provide valuable information, but should be interpreted cautiously.\n\nAnswer B, while partially true, is too absolute. Annual results can also be affected by one-time events and may not always be predictive of future performance.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because quarterly financial statements still provide important information and should not be disregarded entirely.
