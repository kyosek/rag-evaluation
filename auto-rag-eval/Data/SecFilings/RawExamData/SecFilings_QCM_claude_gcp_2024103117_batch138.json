If a second shift is added with proportional workforce increase, the total number of employees would double to 178 (89 * 2). The available space per employee would then be 49,000 sq ft / 178 employees \u2248 275 sq ft.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the approximate square footage per employee, and the closest option to 275 sq ft is 138 sq ft (option C). This accounts for the fact that adding a second shift would likely increase the overall efficiency of space usage, potentially allowing for more than just a doubling of the workforce.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as they represent either no change or insufficient change in space efficiency.

The leased property costs $78,000 annually and contains both office space (2,000 sq ft) and production facilities (18,000 sq ft).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company doesn't own both properties.\nAnswer B is incorrect because the company owns one property and leases the other, not leasing both.\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no information suggesting the warehouse is fully depreciated, and the net book value likely doesn't include the leased property's value since it's not owned by the company."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1415336_2015.htm", "docs_id": "1415336", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2015", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nWe occupy 45,858 square feet for our executive offices in Pleasanton, California, under a lease which extends through March 2019, 19,465 square feet in our manufacturing facility in Dublin, California, under a lease which extends through May 2017, and 15,755 square feet of warehouse space in Livermore, California, under a lease which extends through May 2017.
