This can be seen from the following details:\n\n1. The company is not renewing its lease on the 38,400 sq ft headquarters in Fremont, California.\n2. Instead, they are moving to two smaller facilities in California, totaling about 31,800 sq ft (13,500 + 18,300).\n3. The European headquarters in Ismaning, Germany, with 35,000 sq ft, has a lease until 2008, indicating no immediate changes there.\n4. While they mention owning facilities in France and India, there's no indication of moving all operations to owned properties.\n5. The company is also planning to sublease unused space in Connecticut, further indicating a downsizing trend.\n\nOption A is incorrect because they're actually reducing space in Fremont.
