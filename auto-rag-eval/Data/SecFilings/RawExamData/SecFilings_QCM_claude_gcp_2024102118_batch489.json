By December 31, 1997, how many of these wells were still producing, and what factors contributed to the change in the number of producing wells?\n\nA) 42 producing wells; the difference is due to 12 wells being plugged and abandoned, 5 wells being sold, and 8 additional wells acquired through a back-in after payout provision\nB) 50 producing wells; the difference is due to 9 wells being plugged and abandoned\nC) 42 producing wells; the difference is due to 17 wells being plugged and abandoned over the years\nD) 47 producing wells; the difference is due to 12 wells being plugged and abandoned\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. The passage states that by December 31, 1997, the Partnership had 42 producing wells out of the original 59 productive wells. The difference is accounted for as follows:\n- 12 wells were plugged and abandoned due to unprofitable operations (details provided by year)\n- 5 wells were sold (3 in 1994 and 2 in 1997)\n- The Partnership received interests in 8 additional wells in 1993 due to a back-in after payout provision\n\nThis explanation accounts for all changes in the number of wells and matches the final count of 42 producing wells mentioned in the document.

The passage states that the Company has \"39 business products distribution centers, 21 janitorial and sanitation supply distribution centers and six information technology distribution centers.\" This totals 66 distribution centers across these three categories.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the total number of distribution centers mentioned is 66, the passage also mentions 21 additional local distribution points, making the total number of facilities greater than 66.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the passage specifically states that the Company has \"more than nine million square feet of warehouse space,\" not over 10 million.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while it's true that there are 39 business products distribution centers, this does not represent the majority of their distribution facilities when considering the other types mentioned.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and accurately interpret detailed information about a company's properties and distribution network."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1357231_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1357231", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
