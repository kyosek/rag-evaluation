The document further mentions that \"finding alternative space at market rates could have an adverse impact on its results of operations,\" implying that current market rates are significantly higher. Therefore, if FSE fails to meet the employment condition, the most likely scenario is that their rental costs would increase significantly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate relocation is not mentioned as a consequence. Option B is also not supported by the text, as there's no mention of automatic termination. Option D is unlikely, as expanding operations would not be a logical consequence of failing to meet the employment condition."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "913142_2006.htm", "docs_id": "913142", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nBelden has an executive office that it leases in St. Louis, Missouri, and various manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales and administration offices.

Additionally, it mentions non-bank office locations in various states including Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio, and California. These non-bank locations are used for specialized operations such as lease banking and by subsidiaries like Cedar Hill, LaSalle, and Celtic.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the company has a strong presence in Chicago, it's not exclusive to Illinois, as evidenced by the Philadelphia banking office and non-bank locations in other states.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because although the company has non-bank locations in California, these are not described as banking offices, and the presence in California is not presented as significant compared to the Chicago area.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the information doesn't suggest an even distribution across the Midwest. The banking offices are primarily concentrated in the Chicago area, with only one mentioned outside of this region (in Philadelphia)."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "878314_1999.txt", "docs_id": "878314", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.
