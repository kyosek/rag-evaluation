The net value of properties decreased from $66,172,723 in 2002 to $59,172,763 in 2004, which is approximately a 10.6% decrease, not a 5% increase.\n\nB) Correct.

UTMD owns a 100,000 square foot facility in Midvale, Utah, where its current operations are located. The company also owns a building in Lehi, Utah, which is being leased to an unrelated party. Additionally, UTMD is constructing a new 70,000 square foot facility in Athlone, Ireland, which will support marketing, manufacturing, and product development for European markets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the size of the Irish facility and doesn't accurately represent the status of the Lehi property. Option C is wrong because UTMD is not replacing its Midvale operations, and there's no mention of selling the Lehi property.
