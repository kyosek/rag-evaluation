They have copyright and trade secret protection for their software products, and a U.S. patent on their magnetic guidance technology. However, their R&D spending has been severely limited due to bankruptcy. The passage states that only about $10,000 was spent on R&D from July 1 to December 9, 1994 (the date of bankruptcy filing), and the company has no plans for further expenditures to maintain or enhance its technology.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while Apogee does have some patent protection, they are not actively pursuing patents for all technologies, and they are not investing heavily in R&D due to bankruptcy.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because Apogee does not focus solely on trade secret protection; they also have patent and copyright protection. Additionally, they do not have ongoing R&D efforts due to bankruptcy.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Apogee has greatly reduced R&D activities post-bankruptcy, they haven't abandoned all intellectual property protection.

Out of the 96 wells drilled, how many were still producing as of December 31, 2000, and what percentage does this represent of the total wells drilled?\n\nA) 73 wells, representing 76.04% of total wells drilled\nB) 75 wells, representing 78.13% of total wells drilled\nC) 81 wells, representing 84.38% of total wells drilled\nD) 88 wells, representing 91.67% of total wells drilled\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret numerical data from the given text, as well as perform percentage calculations. According to the passage, 96 wells were drilled in total. Two were dry holes, six were plugged and abandoned due to being uneconomical, and 15 were sold. This leaves 73 wells that were still producing as of December 31, 2000. To calculate the percentage, we divide 73 by 96 and multiply by 100, which gives us 76.04%. This makes option A the correct answer. Options B, C, and D provide plausible but incorrect figures that could trip up students who misread the information or make calculation errors."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1091667_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1091667", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.

The company owns some assets outright, such as service vehicles (\"We own our service vehicles\") and generally owns the towers for their equipment (\"we generally own the towers on which our equipment is located\"). However, they also lease or have agreements for other aspects of their operations.
