The passage states that \"Approximately 26 percent of these offices are located in buildings owned by HSBC Bank USA and the remaining are located in leased premises.\" This means about 74% of branches are leased.\n\n2. The text mentions that HSBC Bank USA has 370 branches in New York, which is significantly more than in any other state listed, indicating the highest concentration of branches.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the bank doesn't own more than 50% of its locations, and its presence in western states is limited (only mentioning California, Washington, and Oregon).\n\nAnswer B is partially correct about owning properties in South America (Uruguay), but the main office is actually in McLean, Virginia, not New York City.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the headquarters at 452 Fifth Avenue was sold in April 2010 and is now leased.

The passage explicitly states, \"The Company considers its facilities to be in excess of its requirements, and efforts are underway to lease or sell excess facilities.\" This clearly indicates that the Company has recognized it has more property than needed and is actively working to reduce its real estate holdings.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage does not mention any plans to purchase additional office space in Huntsville.
