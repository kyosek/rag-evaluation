The correct answer is B because the document states, \"In 2016, we used approximately 18.0% of our current U.S. productive capacity.\" Additionally, the text mentions the company's reliance on Chinese manufacturers for several product lines, including \"blood collection set, IV catheter, Patient Safe\u00ae syringe, 0.5mL insulin syringe, 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes,\" indicating a potential manufacturing challenge if they become unable to purchase from these Chinese suppliers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 21.6% refers to the units manufactured at the headquarters, not the total U.S. capacity utilization. Option C is wrong because 35% is not mentioned in the text, and the company states they could increase domestic production for 1mL and 3mL syringes if needed. Option D is incorrect as 4.21% is not related to capacity utilization (it's part of a loan amount), and the text explicitly states that the property and equipment are adequately covered by insurance."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "921114_2006.htm", "docs_id": "921114", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 1.

We know that 93% of door capacity is in owned facilities.\n2. The owned facilities account for 205 out of 236 total facilities, or about 86.9% of facilities.\n3. This suggests that owned facilities are, on average, larger than leased ones.\n4. We're told the largest breakbulk facility has 347 doors, which gives us a sense of scale.\n5. If we assume the 93% capacity represents about 4,606 doors (93% of 4,953), that would mean the leased facilities have about 347 doors (7% of 4,953).\n6. This distribution seems reasonable given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the total number of doors across all facilities is likely around 4,953. Answer B is the closest to this calculation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret complex data, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}}
