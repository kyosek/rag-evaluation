The PUMA Program was established by the Trust Deed dated July 13, 1990, which provides the general terms and structure for securitization. PUMA Global Trust No. 4 (the Trust) is a specific trust created under this program. The Trust then issued the Class A Mortgage Backed Floating Rate Notes (G-4 Notes) pursuant to a separate Note Trust Deed dated August 19, 2003. This structure shows that while the Trust operates within the broader PUMA Program framework, it issued the G-4 Notes through its own specific legal arrangement (the Note Trust Deed).\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they oversimplify or misrepresent the relationships between these entities and documents. Option A incorrectly suggests the PUMA Program directly issued the notes. Option B incorrectly implies the Trust was established directly by the Trust Deed and acted independently.

The bankruptcy-remote structure of AFS Funding Corp. and AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 1999-A is designed to isolate the securitized assets (the Contracts) from the parent company and other entities. This structure serves two main purposes:\n\n1. It prevents these entities from engaging in business with or incurring liabilities to any other entity (except the Trustee on behalf of the Note holders), which could potentially bring bankruptcy proceedings against them.\n\n2. It reduces the risk that these entities would be consolidated into the bankruptcy proceedings of any other entity.\n\nThis structure protects the securitization process by ensuring that the assets backing the securities (the Contracts and interests in the underlying automobiles) are separated from the financial risks of the parent company or other entities. This isolation helps maintain the integrity of the securitization and protects the interests of the Note holders.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the purpose is not to engage in diverse business activities; in fact, these entities are restricted in their activities.\nAnswer C is incorrect because the structure actually restricts borrowing and lending activities with affiliated entities.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the purpose is not to facilitate direct sales to individual investors, but rather to issue debt securities backed by the Contracts."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "1582249_2019.htm", "docs_id": "1582249", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "ITEM 2.
