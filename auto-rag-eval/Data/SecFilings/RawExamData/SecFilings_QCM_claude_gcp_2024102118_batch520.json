Given the high interest rate and long term, the total repayment will be significantly higher than the principal.\n\nThe question states that the repayment is approximately $89,000 per month.

The recorded cost of total network land and buildings at March 31, 2002 was \u00a389 million ($127 million).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the network properties far outnumber the non-network properties, and the recorded cost for network assets (\u00a389 million) is higher than for non-network assets (\u00a326 million).\n\nOption C contains some accurate information about the non-network properties but is not the most comprehensive or accurate statement overall when compared to the information about network properties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the breakdown shows more freehold or long leasehold interests (53) than leasehold interests (11) for non-network properties."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "810509_1997.txt", "docs_id": "810509", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "ITEM 2.

The lease for the Dublin, Ohio office is said to end in May 2003, with a base rent of $26,350 in the last year of the lease. However, this is an annual figure.
