The lease terms state that the rental payments increase by 7.5% at the end of each 30-month period.\n\nTo calculate the rent at the end of the 90th month:\n1. First increase (after 30 months): $167,586 * 1.075 = $180,155\n2. Second increase (after 60 months): $180,155 * 1.075 = $193,666\n3. The 90th month falls within the third 30-month period, so the rent would still be $193,666\n\nOption A is incorrect as it's the initial rent.\nOption B is incorrect as it's the rent after the first increase.\nOption C is correct as it's the rent after the second increase, which would be in effect at the 90th month.\nOption D is incorrect as it represents a third increase, which wouldn't have occurred yet at the 90th month.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease terms, perform multi-step calculations, and understand how periodic increases work over time."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "786947_2017.htm", "docs_id": "786947", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "ITEM 2.

The passage states that the company has \"twenty-four facilities, located in North America, China and Europe\" for manufacturing and production operations, as well as \"ten warehouse, sales and service locations.\" This totals 34 facilities. The text then mentions that \"Eleven of our principal facilities are owned and twenty-four of our principal facilities are held by lease,\" which adds up to 35 principal facilities. The majority (24 out of 35) are leased.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company clearly leases most of its principal facilities, not just small warehouses and sales offices.\n\nOption B is false because the text explicitly mentions manufacturing operations in China as well as North America and Europe.\n\nOption D is misleading.
