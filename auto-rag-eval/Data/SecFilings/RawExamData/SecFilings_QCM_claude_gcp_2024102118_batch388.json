At the end of 2010, the Elizabethtown facility's net value of $138,000 was classified as an asset held for sale. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Doylestown headquarters remained operational.\nOption B is incorrect because the Elizabethtown facility was closed in 2009, leaving only Doylestown and Lebanon operational.\nOption C is incorrect because it was the Elizabethtown facility that was sold, and this occurred in February 2011, not 2010.

Reducing the number of studios by 30% (rather than 50%) accounts for the fact that studio leases have varying terms, making it more realistic to achieve this reduction by 2014.

Irvine office space: $11,691 per month\n   Annual cost: $11,691 \u00d7 12 = $140,292\n\n2. Lancaster land: This is a one-time purchase, not an ongoing cost, so it doesn't factor into the annual expenses.\n\n3.

The Lancaster land, while purchased outright, would still incur property taxes and potentially maintenance costs. A reasonable estimate for annual property taxes and maintenance on a $109,108 piece of land might be around 10% of its value, or approximately $10,900 per year.\n\nTherefore, the total annual cost including all three properties would be:\n$263,796 + $10,900 = $274,696\n\nThe closest option to this calculated amount is $387,996, which is answer C.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret real estate information, distinguish between one-time purchases and ongoing costs, and make reasonable estimates for unlisted expenses like property taxes and maintenance."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "1058057_2019.htm", "docs_id": "1058057", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2019", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nThe following table presents the approximate square footage of our significant owned and leased facilities as of February 2, 2019:\n(1)Lease terms expire in various years from 2019 through 2025.
