The passage states that the company leases approximately 71,007 square feet out of a total 79,254 square feet in their headquarters building. The lease is set to expire in 2012. Due to a reduction in force, they are actively trying to sublease at least one floor, indicating a need for less space. The text also mentions that the local commercial property market is weak due to the recession. These factors suggest that the company is likely to downsize when the lease expires.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company does not own the building and is not looking to expand.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while they are leasing most of the building, they are trying to sublease space and there's no indication they plan to renew the entire lease.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that they have closed all remote underwriting offices and exited their Toronto facility."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1321544_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1321544", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.
