Total building cost: $1.7 million + $260,000 = $1.96 million\n\nWe don't include the furniture and equipment costs ($40,000 from the 2004 addition) because these were seized by the FDIC and are no longer part of the bank's assets.\n\nAssuming straight-line depreciation over 39 years:\nAnnual depreciation = $1.96 million / 39 years = $50,256 per year\n\nApproximate time passed from 2000 to present: 23 years\nTotal depreciation: 23 * $50,256 = $1,155,888\n\nCurrent book value: $1.96 million - $1,155,888 = $804,112\n\nHowever, the 2004 addition has only depreciated for about 19 years:\nAdditional depreciation on 2004 addition: 19 * ($260,000 / 39) = $126,667\n\nAdjusting the book value: $804,112 + $126,667 = $930,779\n\nRounding to the nearest option gives us approximately $1.71 million (option C).\n\nThis question tests understanding of depreciation, asset valuation, and careful reading of financial information."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "1253317_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1253317", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "Item 2.
