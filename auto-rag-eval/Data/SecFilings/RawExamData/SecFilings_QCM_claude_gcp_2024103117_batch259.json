This aligns with option C, which accurately reflects both the current capabilities and the potential future plans.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the facility is only mentioned as being adequate for Phase I trials, not for all clinical phases or commercial distribution.

In this case, $19,203 million - $7,706 million = $11,497 million. To calculate the percentage this represents of the original cost, divide the net book value by the original cost and multiply by 100: ($11,497 million / $19,203 million) * 100 = 59.87%.
