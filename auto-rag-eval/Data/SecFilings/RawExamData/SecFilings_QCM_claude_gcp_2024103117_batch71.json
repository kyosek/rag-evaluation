The documentation states that the company signed a lease for a new corporate and divisional headquarters facility that is approximately 105,000 square feet with a 15-year term. This represents a significant increase from their previous 29,500 square foot space, indicating expansion. The long lease term (15 years) shows a long-term commitment to the space.
