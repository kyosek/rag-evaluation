The annual rental cost (Y) for New Jersey and Connecticut warehouses is stated as approximately $1,600,000. If the Connecticut landlord cancels the lease, it would affect 98,000 sq ft out of 335,300 sq ft, which is 29.2% of the total leased space. However, the $1,600,000 guaranteed rent covers both New Jersey and Connecticut warehouses, so cancelling just the Connecticut lease would reduce less than 100% of the guaranteed rent. Therefore, option B is correct, as it accurately represents the percentage of space affected and indicates that less than 100% of the guaranteed rent would be reduced."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "877890_2002.htm", "docs_id": "877890", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
