The 6,950 sq ft office space lease expires on November 30, 2016, and there's no mentioned extension option.\n\nTherefore, only the 36,960 sq ft corporate headquarters is guaranteed through 2017.

The documentation clearly states that Class A certificates \"were remarketed to the public,\" while Class B certificates \"were not offered to the public and initially were held by the Seller.\" \n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the ownership percentages.
