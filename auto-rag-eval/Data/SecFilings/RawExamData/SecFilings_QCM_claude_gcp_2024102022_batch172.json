Given that the Amsterdam office (870 sq m) costs \u20ac288,000 per year, we can estimate that the Breda office (1,600 sq m) might cost around \u20ac530,000 per year.\n\nCalculation:\nInvestment repayment: 10 years * \u20ac30,000 = \u20ac300,000\nEstimated lease payment: 15 years * \u20ac530,000 = \u20ac7,950,000\nTotal: \u20ac300,000 + \u20ac7,950,000 = \u20ac8,250,000\n\nThe closest option to this calculated amount is \u20ac2,625,000 (option C), which is about 1/3 of our estimate.

The new facility is approximately 7,000 square feet, which represents a reduction of 4,000 square feet or about 36% (4,000 / 11,000 = 0.3636 or 36.36%).\n\nThe new lease cost is stated as \"approximately $7,000 per month.\" While the original lease cost isn't explicitly stated, we can infer it was around $10,000 per month based on the statement that the new lease \"substantially reduces our monthly operating costs.\" A reduction from $10,000 to $7,000 would be a $3,000 monthly savings.\n\nThis question tests the ability to calculate percentages, make inferences from given information, and pay attention to details in a complex business scenario."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "906347_2001.htm", "docs_id": "906347", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

The document states that for site leasing and broadcast transmission businesses, the company owns, leases, contracts to lease, or occupies under license approximately 1,370 properties. Additionally, they are the licensee of approximately 680 transmitter sites shared with Castle Transmission. The total number of properties is thus 1,370 + 680 = 2,050. To calculate the percentage of shared transmitter sites, we divide 680 by 2,050, which equals 0.3317 or 33.2% when rounded to one decimal place.
