According to the documentation, Applied paid an early termination fee of approximately $1 million to TIAA. The remaining lease obligation extended through 2007 and was in excess of $6 million. By paying the $1 million fee, Applied effectively saved more than $5 million (the difference between the $6+ million obligation and the $1 million fee).
