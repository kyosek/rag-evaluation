The documentation states that the company owns or leases space for its facilities, and explains that in China, land is owned by the State. Companies can acquire land use rights for industrial purposes for up to 50 years, which can be renewed. These rights are transferable and can be used as security for borrowings. Therefore, it's most likely that the company has a mix of owned buildings (as mentioned in \"Our primary facilities, which are owned\") and leased land use rights for the land on which these facilities are built.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because full ownership of land is not possible in China according to the given information. Answer C is wrong because the land use rights are not permanent (they're for up to 50 years) and can be used as collateral.
