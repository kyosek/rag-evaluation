The documentation shows that the company uses different arrangements for its properties. For the production of donuts, muffins, cookies, and cakes, which is similar to the new facility needed, the company currently uses the Dutch Mill Offices in Wyckoff, NJ. This property is leased under an operating lease, as stated in point (2). Therefore, seeking an operating lease for a similar type of facility would be consistent with their current practices.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation doesn't indicate that all production facilities are owned. In fact, it shows that they use both leased and owned properties.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the Philadelphia production facility is under a capital lease, this isn't necessarily the best option for all facilities. The company uses different arrangements for different locations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because although the documentation mentions that certain manufacturing space is near full utilization, it doesn't suggest that building new facilities is their preferred method of expansion.
