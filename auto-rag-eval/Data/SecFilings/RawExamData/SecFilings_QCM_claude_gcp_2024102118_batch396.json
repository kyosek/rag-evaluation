The documentation explicitly states that MMC would be obligated to pre-fund certain reserve accounts, including a rent reserve account equal to three months rent for the entire occupancy of the mortgaged property, in two specific circumstances: (1) if MMC is downgraded below B/B2 (Stable) by any of S&P, Fitch and Moody's, or (2) if an event of default has occurred and is continuing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the credit rating threshold mentioned is higher than what's specified in the document.

If the Company decides to renew the lease for another 25 years under the same terms, and assuming an annual inflation rate of 2% applied to the monthly lease payment, what would be the total lease expense for the year 2030?\n\nA) $709,261\nB) $724,446\nC) $739,935\nD) $755,734\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the monthly lease payment for 2030 considering inflation.\n2. Calculate the annual lease expense for 2030.\n\nThe current monthly lease payment is $36,663. With a 2% annual inflation rate over 25 years (from 2005 to 2030):\n\nFuture Value = Present Value * (1 + inflation rate)^number of years\nFuture Monthly Payment = $36,663 * (1.02)^25 = $61,661.25\n\nAnnual lease expense for 2030:\n$61,661.25 * 12 = $739,935\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) $739,935.\n\nA) $709,261 is too low and doesn't account for enough inflation.\nB) $724,446 is closer but still underestimates the impact of compound inflation.\nD) $755,734 is too high and overestimates the inflation impact.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply compound interest calculations in a real estate context, as well as their attention to detail in extracting relevant information from a complex document."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "929940_2020.htm", "docs_id": "929940", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.

The passage indicates that iRobot employs a flexible leasing strategy. For key locations like Bedford, MA, they have longer-term leases (e.g., the Bedford lease expires in 2025 with options to extend). However, for many other global locations, they use short-term leases, often one year or less, based on the number of workstations needed.
