If 76% of these restaurants are in California, and the company owns the land and building for 5 locations, owns the building and leases the land for 49 locations, what percentage of the company's restaurants outside of California are fully leased (both land and building)?\n\nA) 82.9%\nB) 89.5%\nC) 93.4%\nD) 98.7%\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the number of restaurants in California: \n   76% of 318 = 0.76 * 318 = 241.68 \u2248 242 restaurants\n\n2. Calculate the number of restaurants outside California:\n   318 - 242 = 76 restaurants\n\n3. Calculate the total number of fully leased restaurants:\n   Total restaurants (318) - Owned land and building (5) - Owned building, leased land (49) = 264\n\n4. Assume all owned or partially owned restaurants are in California (worst case for percentage outside California). So, fully leased restaurants outside California:\n   264 - (242 - 5 - 49) = 76 restaurants\n\n5. Calculate the percentage:\n   (76 / 76) * 100 = 100%\n\nHowever, the question asks for the closest percentage from the given options. The nearest to 100% is 93.4%, which is option C.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret complex data, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1080866_2007.htm", "docs_id": "1080866", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.
