The document states Costco operated 634 warehouses as of September 1, 2013.

Based on the given information, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's real estate strategy and operations?\n\nA) The company's flagship store in Manhattan is likely to be significantly larger than its average premium retail store.\nB) The company's outlet stores have longer base lease terms than its premium retail stores.\nC) The company's corporate offices primarily consist of administrative space, with minimal allocation for employee amenities.\nD) The company's day spas occupy more square footage on average than its premium retail stores.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is the correct answer. While the average premium retail store is approximately 5,900 square feet, the document mentions a flagship store in Manhattan separately from the 362 premium retail stores. Flagship stores are typically much larger and more elaborate than standard stores, suggesting it's likely significantly larger than the average.\n\nB) This is incorrect. The document states that the base term for premium retail store leases is generally ten years, while outlet store leases have a base term of generally five years.\n\nC) This is incorrect. While the corporate offices do include 156,000 square feet of administrative space, they also feature an additional 94,000 square feet dedicated to employee amenities such as a fitness center, spa, virtual retail stores, photo studio, and training center, which is a significant allocation.\n\nD) This is incorrect. The average size of day spas is stated as approximately 5,400 square feet, while premium retail stores average about 5,900 square feet. Therefore, day spas are actually slightly smaller on average than premium retail stores."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "715072_2020.htm", "docs_id": "715072", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "ITEM 2.
