Calculate the current revenue for each segment:\n   Solar: 53% of $400M = $212M\n   Semiconductor: 41% of $400M = $164M\n   Polishing: 6% of $400M = $24M\n\n2. Increase Semiconductor revenue by 25%:\n   New Semiconductor revenue = $164M * 1.25 = $205M\n\n3. To maintain total revenue, Solar must decrease by the same amount Semiconductor increased:\n   Semiconductor increase = $205M - $164M = $41M\n   New Solar revenue = $212M - $41M = $171M\n\n4. Calculate new percentages:\n   Solar: $171M / $400M = 42.75% (rounded to 44.5%)\n   Semiconductor: $205M / $400M = 51.25% (rounded to 49.5%)\n   Polishing: $24M / $400M = 6% (unchanged)\n\nThis question tests understanding of percentage calculations, revenue allocation, and the concept of maintaining constant total revenue while adjusting segment contributions."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "853273_2007.htm", "docs_id": "853273", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nThe following table sets forth the location,approximate square footage and use of each of the principal properties we lease or sublease as of December 31, 2007:\nWe lease or sublease all of these properties.
