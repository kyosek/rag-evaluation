The total acreage is stated as 22 acres, but the owned (19 acres) and leased (3 acres) land only accounts for 21 acres. This leaves 1 acre unaccounted for.\n\nOption A is unlikely, as subleasing to other businesses isn't mentioned in the documentation.\nOption C is possible but not explicitly stated in the text.\nOption D might seem correct at first glance, but it's important to consider that land measurements are often approximate.\n\nThe correct answer, B, is the most plausible explanation.

The documentation explicitly states that the $1.2 million write-down was done \"in accordance with the provisions of FASB 121 - 'Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets'\".
