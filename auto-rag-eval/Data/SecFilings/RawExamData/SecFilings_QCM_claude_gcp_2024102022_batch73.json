Original manufacturing space = 29,000 - 8,000 = 21,000 sq ft\n2. New expansion = 20,000 sq ft (assumed to be all manufacturing)\n3. New total square footage = 29,000 + 20,000 = 49,000 sq ft\n4. New manufacturing space = 21,000 + 20,000 = 41,000 sq ft\n\nPercentage calculation: (41,000 / 49,000) * 100 = 83.67%\n\nThe closest option to this result is 70.8%, which is option C.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, make reasonable assumptions, perform multi-step calculations, and select the closest approximation from given options."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "826595_1998.txt", "docs_id": "826595", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 1.
