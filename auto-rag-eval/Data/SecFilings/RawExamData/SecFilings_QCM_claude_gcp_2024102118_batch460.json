Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate and provides the best strategic recommendation?\n\nA) The company should consolidate all New York operations into the 1115 Broadway location, as it has the largest square footage and could accommodate the 180 Madison Ave. office.\n\nB) The Mississippi location should be downsized, as it has the largest total square footage but the smallest office space relative to its size.\n\nC) The company should consider selling the owned Petersburg, PA facility and leasing a smaller warehouse, as it was temporarily closed and only reopened due to an unexpected event.\n\nD) The Philippines location should be expanded to include more manufacturing capabilities, as it currently only handles administrative and support functions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most strategic recommendation based on the given information. The Petersburg, PA facility is owned by the company and has a large square footage (140,000 sq ft), but the documentation states that management decided to close this facility in June 2005. It was only temporarily reopened in September 2005 due to a backlog caused by Hurricane Katrina. This suggests that the facility is not essential for regular operations and may be oversized for the company's needs. Selling this owned property and leasing a smaller warehouse as needed would likely improve efficiency and free up capital.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't consider lease expiration dates or the specific uses of each New York location. Option B is not necessarily true, as the Mississippi location may require more warehouse space due to its function. Option D is speculation not supported by the given information, which only mentions sample and pattern making for the Philippines location."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "9342_2000.htm", "docs_id": "9342", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "Item 2.

The two locations that provide the most square footage while minimizing total monthly rent are:\n\n1. Jupiter, FL (1070 E. Indiantown Road): 5,500 sf for $8,247/month\n2. Tampa, FL (1408 N.
