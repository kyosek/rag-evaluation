The correct answer is B because the text states that Cyanotech Corporation leases approximately 183 acres at the HOST Park facility. Of this, about 90 acres are fully developed, and an additional 93 acres were agreed upon in 1997. However, the additional 93 acres are leased on a year-to-year basis, as stated in the passage: \"The State of Hawaii has agreed to allow the Company to lease this additional 93 acres on a year to year basis, until such time that the Company determines the need for a longer lease term.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while 90 acres are fully developed, the total leased area is 183 acres, and the additional 93 acres are not on a 30-year lease.\n\nOption C is incorrect because although the total leased area is 183 acres, not all of it is under a 30-year lease. The original lease is for 30 years, expiring in 2025, but the additional 93 acres are on a year-to-year basis.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it understates the total leased area and ignores the agreement for the additional 93 acres."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1158323_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1158323", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.

The 41,000 square feet and 2014 expiration date actually refer to the Chicago lease.\n\nOption B is also incorrect as it combines information from two different leases.

This creates a multi-layered management structure where the General Partner of Raines Lenders, L.P. is itself a partnership with both individual and corporate general partners.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Steven D. Ezell, Michael A. Hartley, and 222 Partners, Inc. are not directly managing Raines Lenders, L.P., but are instead general partners of its General Partner.\n\nOption B is incorrect because 222 Raines, Ltd. is described as a Tennessee limited partnership, not a corporation.\n\nOption C is incorrect on multiple counts: Raines Lenders, L.P. is a Delaware (not Tennessee) limited partnership, and 222 Raines, Ltd. is its General Partner, not its Limited Partner."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1423869_2020.htm", "docs_id": "1423869", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.
