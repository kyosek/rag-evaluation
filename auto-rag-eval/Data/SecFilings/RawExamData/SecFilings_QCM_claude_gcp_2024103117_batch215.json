FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe response to Part II, Item 8, is submitted as a separate section of this Form\n10-K.\nRegistrant has \"unaudited\" Financial Statements for its fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and 1993. As a result of Registrant's operations prior to filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, and subsequently its operation as a Debtor in Possession inside a Chapter 11 proceeding, accounting records were not maintained in a manner to support an audit. In March of 1995, Registrant was informed by its former outside accountant, Coopers & Lybrand, that the status of Registrant's accounting records would not support an audit of 1992 and 1993 operations (Letter of March 22, 1995, attached as an Exhibit to Form 10-K filed for the Registrant's 1994 fiscal year, and by this reference incorporated herein). As a result, Registrant is unable to provide \"audited\" Financial Statements for 1992 and 1993, without undue and overburdening expense and delay, which would seriously jeopardize Registrant's business, and would utilize liquid capital urgently required to carry Registrant's business forward.\nOn this basis, Registrant has supplied \"unaudited\" Financial Statements which Registrant's management believe in good faith to accurate and fairly represent the operations of Registrant for fiscal 1992 and fiscal 1993.\nITEM 9."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is unable to provide audited financial statements for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 due to inadequate accounting records during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

This approach aligns with the company's actions as described in the documentation. The company acknowledges that it cannot provide audited financial statements due to the state of its accounting records during the bankruptcy proceedings, and that obtaining an audit would be unduly expensive and time-consuming, potentially jeopardizing the business. Instead, the company provides unaudited financial statements that management believes in good faith to be accurate and representative of operations, along with an explanation of why audited statements are not available.

The documentation states that the Company operates a main office, eight branch office facilities (including six full-service branches and one limited service branch), and one loan production office. This totals 9 properties. The main office and branch offices are owned by the Company, while the loan production office is leased. This matches the breakdown in option D: 8 owned properties (main office + 7 branches) and 1 leased property (loan production office).\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they state 10 properties instead of 9.
