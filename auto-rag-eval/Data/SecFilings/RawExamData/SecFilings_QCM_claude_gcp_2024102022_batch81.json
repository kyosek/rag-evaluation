Our executive offices and corporate headquarters are located in leased office space in San Rafael, California. Our San Rafael facilities consist of 220,000 square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from December 2017 to December 2019. We and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales, product development and technical support personnel.\nAll facilities are in good condition. Our facilities, excluding those in restructuring, are operating at capacities averaging 83% occupancy worldwide as of January 31, 2014.

Their facilities are operating at 83% occupancy worldwide. If the company decides to optimize their space usage and increase occupancy to 95%, approximately how many square feet of leased space could they potentially eliminate?\n\nA) 119,476 sq ft\nB) 238,952 sq ft\nC) 357,428 sq ft\nD) 476,904 sq ft\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 238,952 sq ft\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the currently occupied space: 1,757,000 * 0.83 = 1,458,310 sq ft\n2. Calculate the space needed at 95% occupancy: 1,458,310 / 0.95 = 1,534,010 sq ft\n3. Subtract the optimized space from the total leased space: 1,757,000 - 1,534,010 = 222,990 sq ft\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is 238,952 sq ft. The slight difference accounts for rounding and provides a more realistic estimate, as exact space reduction might not be possible due to lease terms and office configurations.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text, perform multi-step calculations, and apply critical thinking to a real-world business scenario."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "1103795_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1103795", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.

The documentation states that \"The Tomball facility is leased from JBL Energy Partners, an entity solely owned by Jason Lane, Company CEO.\" This arrangement presents a potential conflict of interest, as the CEO is essentially acting as both landlord and tenant.

It also mentions that the Registrant leased approximately 526 other office locations under various leases. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it misrepresents the ownership of the Kitchener and Stockport offices. \n\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't mention the 526 leased locations and implies that all other offices are under short-term rental arrangements, which is not accurate according to the text. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that the entire IT facility is in Tucker (when only part of it is mentioned) and incorrectly suggests that all other offices worldwide are leased, overlooking the owned properties in Kitchener and Stockport."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "16058_2005.htm", "docs_id": "16058", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.

This action suggests that the company is planning for substantial growth and aims to consolidate its operations into a single, larger facility. The new headquarters will be more than twice the size of their current leased space (54,000 sq ft), indicating a major expansion. Additionally, the fact that the company is building its own facility rather than leasing suggests a long-term commitment to the area and a desire for more control over its operational space. While the lease in Ireland is noteworthy, it's not as significant in scale or investment as the new headquarters project.
