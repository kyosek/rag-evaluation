The U.S. facility currently uses only 20% of its productive capacity, suggesting room for increased production, but not necessarily enough to cover all products.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company does have some domestic production capabilities. Option B is incorrect because while the company could increase production, it couldn't immediately shift all production domestically and would need alternate manufacturers for some products.

The documentation states that the company leases its executive offices from Cactus Family Investments, LLC, \"a firm in which the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice President are principals.\" This arrangement represents a related party transaction, where company executives have a financial interest on both sides of the deal.

They are discontinuing operations at the Southboro, Massachusetts facility and plan to terminate the lease, indicating a consolidation of operations.\n2. The leases on their principal facilities in Boulder and Corvallis expire on various dates from 2003 through 2006, suggesting they are maintaining flexibility in their major locations.\n3.

The Tioga, ND property is not currently used in operations, making it an unnecessary expense. Selling it would generate funds that could be used to purchase the Longmont, CO property, which has the largest leased space (18,400 sq. ft.) and the highest monthly rent ($25,300). Owning this property would eliminate a significant ongoing expense and secure a large operational facility.\n\nB) This is incorrect because the Killdeer, ND property is already being used as collateral for a mortgage debt obligation, which could complicate using it for additional operations. Additionally, relocating operations from Texas to North Dakota would likely disrupt business activities.\n\nC) This is not the best option because the two Denver office leases expire at different times (June 2022 and April 2024), making immediate consolidation difficult. Furthermore, this doesn't address the larger issue of owned vs. leased properties.\n\nD) This is not optimal because the Douglas, WY lease is expiring soon (December 2021), and investing in expanding a leased property doesn't improve the company's long-term financial position as much as owning property would."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "849213_2012.htm", "docs_id": "849213", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.

From the given information:\n\nTotal cost: $5.726 billion\nAccumulated depreciation: $2.663 billion\nNet book value: $5.726 billion - $2.663 billion = $3.063 billion\n\nThis net book value suggests an aggressive depreciation policy because:\n1.
