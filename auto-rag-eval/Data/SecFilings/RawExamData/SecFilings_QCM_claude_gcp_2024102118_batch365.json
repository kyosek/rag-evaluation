Their current fabrication capacity is 25,000 units per year, but with a $2.5 million investment, it could increase to 28,500 units per year.

The Barrington System passed 71,000 homes with a 65% penetration rate, which equals approximately 46,150 basic subscribers (71,000 * 0.65). It also had a higher penetration rate (65%) compared to the South Suburban System (60%).\n\nB) This is incorrect. The South Suburban System passed fewer homes (62,300) than the Barrington System (71,000).\n\nC) This is incorrect. While the combined number of homes passed is indeed 133,300 (71,000 + 62,300), the average penetration rate would be 62.5% ((65% + 60%) / 2), not the exact penetration rate for both systems.\n\nD) This is incorrect. The total number of basic subscribers would be approximately 83,530 (46,150 for Barrington + 37,380 for South Suburban), not 82,380.\n\nThis question tests the ability to accurately interpret and calculate figures from the given information, requiring careful attention to detail and mathematical skills."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1083132_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1083132", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "Item 2.

The company announced a 25% workforce reduction in August 2005 and plans to consolidate operations within their existing office space. This reduction in staff and consolidation effort would likely result in excess space that is no longer needed. Therefore, attempting to sublease a portion of their existing space is most likely an effort to efficiently use the remaining space after the workforce reduction and operational consolidation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while generating additional revenue might be a secondary benefit, it's not the primary reason given the context of workforce reduction and consolidation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as there's no mention of local zoning regulations requiring subleasing of unused space in the provided information.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the company is reducing staff and consolidating operations, which suggests they are not preparing for expansion into new markets at this time."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "880417_2003.htm", "docs_id": "880417", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nThe Bank owns and operates its main office at 6 West Jackson Street, Millersburg, Ohio 44654.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their future property plans?\n\nA) The company will maintain all current office leases, including those in Markham, Seattle, and Atlanta.\nB) The company will only keep its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, and close all other office locations.\nC) The company will retain its headquarters and the newly leased space in Lincoln, Nebraska, while likely discontinuing other office leases except for the Nashville location.\nD) The company will sell its headquarters and consolidate all operations into the newly leased space in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation states that the company owns its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, and has recently leased an additional 19,300 square feet of space in the same city for survey operations. It also mentions that due to the transition to a remote workforce, they do not anticipate renewing the office leases in Markham, Seattle, and Atlanta upon expiration. However, the Nashville office is on a month-to-month lease, which they seem to intend to keep. This information suggests that the company will retain its headquarters and the new leased space in Lincoln, while likely discontinuing other office leases except for the Nashville location.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company explicitly states they do not plan to renew most of their current leases. Option B is wrong because it doesn't account for the newly leased space in Lincoln or the continued lease in Nashville. Option D is incorrect because there's no indication that the company plans to sell its headquarters, which is described as housing essential operations and securing their credit facilities."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "203200_1999.txt", "docs_id": "203200", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

The documentation explicitly states that the $1.2 million write-down was done \"in accordance with the provisions of FASB 121 - 'Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.'\" This standard is applied when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, requiring a write-down to the lower fair value. The fact that a write-down occurred suggests that the asset's carrying amount exceeded its fair value, likely due to the halted construction and changed business conditions."}}
