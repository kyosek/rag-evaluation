During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company moved its production department, materials management and service departments into a new leased facility located in Alpharetta, Georgia.

WCI owns a 40,000 sq ft facility on a 4.7-acre site, plus an additional 4.4 acres of adjacent property. However, the question asks for square footage of buildings, not land. They leased 11,300 sq ft until the second quarter of fiscal 2000, and then moved into a new 21,000 sq ft leased facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2000.
