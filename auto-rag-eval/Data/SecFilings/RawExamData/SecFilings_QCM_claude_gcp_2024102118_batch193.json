However, the company has also purchased two properties: a 6,200 sq ft building in Safety Harbor, Florida for office and training purposes, and a 24,000 sq ft building in Southfield, Michigan for office use. This demonstrates a mixed approach where leasing is the primary strategy, but strategic purchases are made for specific needs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company does lease most of its spaces, it's not exclusive as they own two properties.\nOption B is inaccurate as there's no indication of owning large office buildings in major cities.\nOption D is wrong because the company leases spaces across the country, not just on the coasts, and their owned properties are not exclusively in the Midwest.\n\nThis question tests the examinee's ability to analyze complex real estate information and identify the overall strategy from specific details provided."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "717197_1998.txt", "docs_id": "717197", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 1.\tBusiness.\nInterWest Medical Corporation (the \"Company\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Oklahoma on March 3, 1983.
