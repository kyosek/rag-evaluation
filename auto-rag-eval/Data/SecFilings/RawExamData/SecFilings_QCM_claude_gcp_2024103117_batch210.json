Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000 is being filed pursuant to Rule 15d-2.

The document clearly states that Bracknell Corporation is filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K to comply with Rule 15d-2. This rule requires companies to file a special report with certified financial statements for their last full fiscal year if their registration statement did not include such statements. In this case, Bracknell's Registration Statement (No. 333-47608) became effective on December 11, 2000, but did not contain certified financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000. Therefore, they are filing this report to provide those certified financial statements as required by Rule 15d-2.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not a standard annual report, but a special filing to comply with Rule 15d-2. Option C is incorrect as this report is specifically for the past fiscal year (ended October 31, 2000), not the current year.

In March 2002, they entered into a Fourth Amendment to Office Lease Space Agreement, which removed the 44,400 square feet of excess space, leaving the Company with 34,982 rentable square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company was reducing, not expanding its space.
