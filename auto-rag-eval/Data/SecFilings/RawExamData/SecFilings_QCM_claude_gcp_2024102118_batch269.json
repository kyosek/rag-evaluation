The information provided indicates that Watsco employs a predominantly leasing-based strategy for both its warehousing and transportation assets. This can be seen from the following details:\n\n1. Out of 6.8 million square feet of warehousing and distribution facilities, approximately 6.5 million square feet is leased.\n2. Of the 806 ground transport vehicles, 442 trucks were leased, which is more than half of the fleet.\n3. The corporate headquarters and all Staffing segment locations are leased.\n4. The relatively low capital expenditure of $7.3 million in 2005 further supports a leasing-focused strategy.\n\nThis approach likely allows Watsco to maintain operational flexibility and manage its capital expenditures effectively.

First, it requires calculating the percentage of space outside the U.S. The document states that out of 74.6 million total square feet, approximately 5.4 million square feet are in about 35 countries outside the U.S. This calculates to 7.2% (5.4 / 74.6 = 0.0724 or 7.24%, rounded to 7.2%). \n\nSecondly, the question asks about a unique characteristic of one of their properties. The document mentions, \"The Corporation has a 49.9 percent joint venture interest in this property.\" This corresponds to option C.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they either have the wrong percentage or an unmentioned property characteristic.
