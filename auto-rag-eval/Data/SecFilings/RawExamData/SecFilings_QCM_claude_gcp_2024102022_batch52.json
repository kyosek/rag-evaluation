Options A, B, and C all use such language and refer to future projections or beliefs about upcoming trends.\n\nOption D, however, is a statement of historical fact about the company's past performance. It does not use any forward-looking language and does not make any predictions or express beliefs about future events. Therefore, it is not considered a forward-looking statement as defined in the document.\n\nThis question tests the ability to distinguish between forward-looking statements and factual statements based on the criteria provided in the document, requiring careful attention to the language used and the nature of the information presented."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "741556_2003.txt", "docs_id": "741556", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
