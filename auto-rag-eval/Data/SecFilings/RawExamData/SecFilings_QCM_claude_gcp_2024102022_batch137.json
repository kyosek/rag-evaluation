They also lease approximately 75,000 active outdoor sites for their advertising structures. If the company's annual lease expense for the 127 leased operating facilities is $7.6 million, and the total annual lease expense for all leased properties (including outdoor sites) is $233.3 million, what percentage of the company's billboard advertising net revenues does the total annual lease expense represent?\n\nA) 19%\nB) 20.5%\nC) 22.3%\nD) 25.7%\n\nCorrect Answer: A) 19%\n\nExplanation: This question requires careful reading and multi-step calculations. The key information is:\n1. Total annual lease expense for 127 operating facilities: $7.6 million\n2. Total annual lease expense for outdoor sites: $225.7 million ($233.3 million - $7.6 million)\n3. The $225.7 million for outdoor sites represents 19% of billboard advertising net revenues\n\nTo solve this, we need to recognize that the total lease expense ($233.3 million) is slightly higher than the $225.7 million mentioned for outdoor sites alone. However, the question asks about the percentage of billboard advertising net revenues, which is explicitly stated as 19% in the passage.
