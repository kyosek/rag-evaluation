The restructuring charge will be recognized in the first quarter of 1996 financial statements, applying the conservatism principle. This is evident from the statement: \"The total estimated charge related to these planned actions is $15 million, net of $6.5 million of income tax benefits, and will be accrued in the first quarter of 1996.\"\n\nThe conservatism principle is being applied because the company is recognizing the estimated losses from the restructuring plan as soon as they are known and can be reasonably estimated, even though the actual restructuring activities will not be completed until the end of the first quarter of 1997.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the charge cannot be recognized in 1995, as the restructuring plan was approved after the 1995 fiscal year ended.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the charge is being recognized in Q1 2016, the primary principle being applied is conservatism, not materiality.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the entire charge is being recognized in Q1 2016, not spread over multiple periods, and this doesn't involve the revenue recognition principle."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "72573_2020.htm", "docs_id": "72573", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2020", "text": "Item 2.

The facility includes office space, a mechanic shop, and a warehouse, totaling 24,000 square feet.

The total square footage is 24,000 (6,000 for office + 6,000 for mechanic shop + 12,000 for warehouse). To calculate the cost per square foot per year, we divide $180,000 by 24,000, which equals $7.50 per square foot per year.\n\nRegarding the conflict of interest, when a CEO leases property to their own company, there's a potential for overcharging. This is because the CEO could potentially use their position to set a higher rent than market rate, benefiting personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders. Therefore, option A is correct as it accurately calculates the cost per square foot and identifies the potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe monthly rent of $15,000 mentioned in the text aligns with the annual rent of $180,000 ($15,000 * 12 months = $180,000), providing an internal consistency check for the question."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "862668_1998.txt", "docs_id": "862668", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
