The PUMA Program was established by the Trust Deed dated July 13, 1990, which provides the general framework for securitization. PUMA Global Trust No. 1 (the Trust) is a specific trust created under this program. The G-1 Notes were then issued by this Trust pursuant to the G-1 Note Trust Deed dated September 25, 2001. This structure shows how the Trust operates within the broader PUMA Program framework while being the specific entity that issued the G-1 Notes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the PUMA Program itself didn't directly issue the notes. Option B is wrong because PUMA Global Trust No. 1 wasn't established by the 1990 Trust Deed; rather, it was created later under the program established by that deed. Option D is incorrect because while Perpetual Trustees Australia Limited is the Issuer Trustee, it didn't directly issue the notes without the involvement of PUMA Global Trust No. 1."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1045545_2013.htm", "docs_id": "1045545", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "ITEM 2.
