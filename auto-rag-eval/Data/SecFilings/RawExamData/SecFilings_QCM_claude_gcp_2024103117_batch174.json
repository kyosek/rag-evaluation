The Vulture Peak claims alone account for 476.1 acres, and the Southern Beardmore claims cover 269 hectares (approximately 664.7 acres), already exceeding the stated total.\n\nOption C is correct. The KRK West property covers 15 square miles, which is equivalent to 9,600 acres. This is significantly larger than the Southern Beardmore claims (664.7 acres) and the Vulture Peak claims (476.1 acres).\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company does have claims in two Canadian provinces (Ontario) and one U.S. state (Arizona), the Arizona property (Vulture Peak) is not the smallest.

Finally, it specifies that CACI's corporate headquarters was located in Arlington, Virginia, occupying approximately 118,000 square feet of space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the corporate headquarters is not in Maryland.

Divide total rent by total square footage\n\nTotal annual rent: $225,000 + $40,000 + $30,000 + $12,000 = $307,000\nTotal square footage: 18,000 + 7,800 + 3,700 + 150 = 29,650 sq ft\n\nAverage annual rent per square foot:\n$307,000 / 29,650 = $10.3541 per sq ft\n\nRounded to the nearest cent, this is $10.32 per sq ft.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information, perform multi-step calculations, and interpret financial data in a real estate context."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "812301_2004.txt", "docs_id": "812301", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
