Business\nCompany Overview\nWe were incorporated as Southern States Sign Company on July 15, 2008, in the State of Nevada for the purpose of finding suitable locations for billboard signs, signing leases with the property owners to build billboards on the property, contracting with a construction company to build billboards, and selling the billboard space to advertisers.\nWe are a development stage company and have not generated any sales to date. Since our inception, we have been attempting to raise money to secure regulatory approval from the necessary local government agencies and to fund the construction of a billboard on our leased sites, but have not been able to secure the funds necessary to do so. The lack of funds and the present economy have prevented that from happening. As we have been unable to raise the capital necessary to implement our business plan, we have recently been engaged in a search for other business opportunities which may benefit our shareholders and allow us to raise capital and operate. Recent negotiations with what we believe is a more viable business opportunity leads us to believe that we will be revising our business plan and focus over the next year.
