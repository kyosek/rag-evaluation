According to the documentation, the company owns undeveloped commercial real estate in Greenville, Alabama, and has capitalized site preparation costs along with the property value. The passage specifically states that \"There are no material improvements such as paving, parking lots or fencing that would be recorded as land improvements and depreciated over the appropriate useful life.\" This implies that the capitalized costs for site preparation (clearing, filling, and leveling) are considered part of the land cost and not separate depreciable improvements. Land and land preparation costs are typically not depreciated because land is considered to have an infinite useful life. Therefore, these capitalized costs should remain on the balance sheet indefinitely without depreciation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because capitalizing these costs (rather than expensing them) is the appropriate treatment for land preparation.\nOption B is incorrect because land and its preparation costs are not depreciated.\nOption D is incorrect because there's no standard amortization period for land costs, and amortization is not typically applied to land."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "37996_1999.txt", "docs_id": "37996", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "Item 2.

We also own approximately 52 acre-feet of permitted (and some certificated) quasi-municipal water rights, which are used to supply the water for the Wynn Las Vegas lake/mountain feature.

The documentation states that Wynn currently owns approximately 240 acres of land in Las Vegas. Additionally, Wynn owns water rights totaling approximately 986 acre-feet (934 acre-feet of permitted domestic and recreation water rights plus 52 acre-feet of permitted quasi-municipal water rights). The combination of the land acreage and the total water rights is crucial for understanding the full value and development potential of the property.
