The document states that the company is moving from a 48,000 square foot space in Santa Clara to a 19,700 square foot space in Redwood City. This represents a significant downsizing of office space. Additionally, the text explicitly mentions that \"The Company estimates the annual occupancy cost of the new space will be approximately $900,000 less than the cost of the prior facility.\" This directly supports the statement in option C about reducing annual occupancy costs by approximately $900,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company is actually reducing its office space, not expanding it.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the new lease in Redwood City is stated to expire in 2013, not 2020.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company did negotiate a lower overall cost, it's not just due to lower rent per square foot.
