The passage states that the Company \"owns and operates three adjacent manufacturing facilities in Statesville, North Carolina\" which \"together comprise approximately 382,000 square feet.\" This is the total owned and operated space in Statesville. The passage also mentions that these facilities house the manufacturing operations as well as corporate offices and other departments, but doesn't specify the exact breakdown. However, they are described as \"manufacturing facilities,\" implying that the primary use of the entire 382,000 sq ft is for manufacturing.\n\nThe 167,000 sq ft of leased distribution and warehouse facilities are not included in the owned and operated manufacturing space. The 129,000 sq ft in Lockhart, Texas was already sold and is not relevant to the Statesville operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes the leased space in the total and miscalculates the percentage. Options C and D are incorrect for similar reasons. Only option B correctly identifies the owned and operated space and recognizes that it's primarily used for manufacturing."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "1420031_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1420031", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "ITEM 2.

This sum is $41,146 + Tokyo office rent, which rounds to $43,386 (the closest option provided).\n\nThe potential challenge is that the lease for the company's headquarters in Torrance, California, expires on March 31, 2019.
