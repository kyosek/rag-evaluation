PROPERTIES\nCitizens owns a modern, 15-story office building which houses the Corporation's principal offices and the main banking offices of Citizens. The building is located at 20 Northwest Third Street, Evansville, Indiana, and is in excellent condition. The Corporation and Citizens presently occupy approximately 85% of the building and the remainder is leased to various tenants. The Corporation and Citizens also utilize four other buildings in close proximity to the main banking office in downtown Evansville which are also owned and are available for future office needs of the Corporation. A portion of this space is also currently being leased by various tenants. The Corporation's subsidiaries own 112 of the 172 remaining offices in which they conduct their businesses. The net investment, as of December 31, 1998, of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in property and equipment was $101,160,000. Two properties are security for real estate mortgages payable which balances totaled $1,866,000 at December 31, 1998. None of the other properties are subject to material liens or other encumbrances.\nManagement of the Corporation believes that, as a group, the facilities are in satisfactory condition and repair and will be adequate to meet its foreseeable needs.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A bank is considering purchasing Citizens' main office building. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements would be most accurate in assessing the potential investment?\n\nA) The building is fully occupied by Citizens and its subsidiaries, indicating strong demand for office space in the area.\n\nB) The building's location in downtown Evansville and its excellent condition suggest it could be a valuable asset, but the bank should consider the potential loss of rental income from current tenants.\n\nC) With two properties secured by mortgages, the bank should be cautious about assuming additional debt associated with this building.\n\nD) The building's age and the bank's occupation of only 85% of the space indicate it may not be a wise investment without significant renovations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate assessment based on the information provided. The documentation states that the building is modern, 15-story, in excellent condition, and located in downtown Evansville. These factors suggest it could be a valuable asset. However, it also mentions that Citizens and its subsidiaries occupy only about 85% of the building, with the remainder leased to various tenants. A potential buyer should consider that purchasing the building might result in the loss of this rental income if Citizens vacates the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the building is not fully occupied by Citizens and its subsidiaries; they only occupy 85%.\n\nOption C is misleading because while two properties are mentioned as having mortgages, the main office building is not specifically stated to be one of them. Moreover, the total mortgage amount of $1,866,000 is relatively small compared to the overall net investment in property and equipment of $101,160,000.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the building is described as \"modern\" and in \"excellent condition,\" contradicting the implication that it might need significant renovations due to age."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "913144_2010.htm", "docs_id": "913144", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.

Furthermore, while the current space is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future, the document explicitly states, \"it is likely that we will expand into additional facilities and perhaps new locations to accommodate future growth.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases, not owns, its office spaces.
