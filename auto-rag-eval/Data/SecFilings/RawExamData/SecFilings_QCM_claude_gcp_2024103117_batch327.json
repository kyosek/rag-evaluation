Furthermore, it mentions that \"All but one of the owned properties is free of any related debt,\" implying that one owned property does have associated debt. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that all facilities are owned, which contradicts the information about 12 leased properties.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the company's policy is to \"maintain, repair and renovate its properties on a continuing basis, replacing older structures with new buildings and yard facilities as the need for such replacement arises.\" This indicates a dynamic rather than static approach to property management.\n\nOption D is incorrect for two reasons: first, the company has properties in 14 states, not 15, and second, it states that all properties are debt-free and owned outright, which contradicts the information about leased properties and one property with debt."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1670869_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1670869", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.

If all leases were to expire as scheduled without renewal, in which year would the company retain control of the LEAST amount of square footage from the specifically mentioned domestic administrative, sales, marketing, support, consulting and product development offices?\n\nA) 2003\nB) 2004\nC) 2005\nD) 2006\n\nCorrect Answer: D) 2006\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful analysis of the given information. The text states that the leases on the Boulder (37,000 sq ft), Corvallis (30,000 sq ft), Raleigh (16,000 sq ft), and Southboro (12,000 sq ft) facilities \"expire on various dates from 2003 through 2006.\" Without more specific information on individual expiration dates, we must assume a worst-case scenario where leases expire sequentially.\n\nIn 2003, the company would lose control of at least one facility but retain the others. In 2004 and 2005, it would lose additional facilities but still have some remaining. By 2006, all mentioned leases would have expired, leaving the company with the least amount of square footage from these specific offices. Therefore, 2006 is the correct answer as it represents the point at which the company would control the least amount of the mentioned office space if no leases were renewed."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "34782_2003.txt", "docs_id": "34782", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
