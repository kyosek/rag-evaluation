According to the documentation, as of December 30, 2012, Susser Holdings Corporation owned 262 of its operating retail stores and leased 297 stores, indicating that they leased more retail stores than they owned. In the wholesale segment, the company owned 56 dealer locations and leased 33 locations, showing that they owned a majority of their dealer locations. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leased more retail stores than it owned, not vice versa. Option C is incorrect as the numbers of owned and leased retail stores were not equal, and the company did not lease all of its dealer locations. Option D is incorrect because while the company did own fewer retail stores than it leased, it had 57 sites for future stores and 51 surplus properties, which does not support the statement about having a higher number of owned surplus properties."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "72243_1997.txt", "docs_id": "72243", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1997", "text": "Item 2 Properties\nThe main properties of the Company consist of 107 facilities, including warehouses, offices, showrooms, paved outside storage areas and covered pipe storage sheds.
