The text specifically states that \"approximately 54% are leased and approximately 46% are owned.\" Furthermore, the facilities consist of \"industrial laundries, cleanroom laundries, warehouses, distribution centers, satellites, depots, stand alone garages and four retail stores.\" This aligns most closely with option B, which correctly identifies the percentage of leased facilities and mentions some of the facility types listed in the document.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states 60% of facilities are owned, which contradicts the given information. Option C is incorrect because it overstates the importance of retail stores (only four are mentioned) and incorrectly suggests that owned facilities are the majority.

Original loan amount: MYR80,000\n2. Loan term: 60 months (5 years)\n3. Monthly payment: MYR1,596\n4. Outstanding balance after about 13-14 months (Dec 31, 2017): MYR75,012\n\nUsing a loan amortization calculator or formula, we can determine that an interest rate of approximately 3.9% per annum would result in these figures. This aligns with the statement that the rate is the base lending rate minus 3.94%, suggesting a base rate of around 7.84% at the time the loan was issued.\n\nThe other options are either too low (2.1%), slightly too high (4.7%), or significantly too high (5.3%) to fit the given loan terms and remaining balance."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "796534_2001.txt", "docs_id": "796534", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

August 2002 to December 2003 (17 months):\n   Monthly payment: $16,606\n   Total for this period: 17 * $16,606 = $282,302\n\n2.
