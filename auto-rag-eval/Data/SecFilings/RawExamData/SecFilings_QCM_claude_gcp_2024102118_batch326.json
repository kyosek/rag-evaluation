When a company is uncertain about the future use of an asset but hasn't made a definitive decision to dispose of it, the appropriate accounting treatment is to test the asset for impairment and potentially adjust its carrying value and useful life. In this case, the company has written down improvements for facilities they know they won't need, but they're unsure about one building. They should assess whether the carrying value of the leasehold improvements in this building exceeds their fair value, and if so, recognize an impairment loss. They should also reassess the useful life of these improvements. However, as long as the assets are still in use and a final decision hasn't been made, the company should continue to depreciate them, albeit potentially over a shorter period if the useful life has changed.
