Those facilities were owned and operated by Ms. Janet Moore (an officer and director of the Company), Ilse Sultanian, Susan Irani Rigdon and Jennifer Irani, some of whom are shareholders. The rent was $14,000 per month. Management believed that there would have been no significant difference in the terms of the property rental if the Company was renting from a third party. On June 18, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a building from an unaffiliated party in Irvine, California, commencing September 1, 2009 and ending August 31, 2016. The initial base rent is set at $18,490 with a security deposit of $22,080. The sum of $40,568 was due upon execution of the lease. In October and November 2009 the Company moved its operations to this facility. Total rent expense for fiscal 2009 was $168,000 and for fiscal 2010 was $236,872.

In June 2009, they signed a new lease agreement for $18,490 per month, starting September 1, 2009. The total rent expense for fiscal 2010 was $236,872.

June-August 2010: 3 months at $14,000 = $42,000\n2. September-November 2010: 3 months of overlap\n   - Old lease: 3 x $14,000 = $42,000\n   - New lease: 3 x $18,490 = $55,470\n3. December 2010: 1 month at $18,490\n\nThe overlapping period (September-November) cost would be the sum of both leases: $42,000 + $55,470 = $97,470. However, the question asks for the approximate amount of the overlap, which is represented by the additional cost incurred during this period. This is the difference between the new lease and the old lease for these 3 months: $55,470 - $42,000 = $13,470.\n\nOption B ($55,470) is the closest to this amount, representing the cost of the new lease during the overlap period, which is the best approximation of the additional expense incurred due to the overlap."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "1627857_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1627857", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.
