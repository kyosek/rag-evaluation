The series of transactions described in the document suggests a strategic sale-leaseback arrangement. By exercising the purchase option and then immediately selling the property to the City of Pikeville, the company was able to negotiate a rent-free lease until April 30, 2013.

The Partnership cannot be dissolved prior to the resolution of a pending class action suit.\n\nD) The Partnership received $10,138,991 in total proceeds and is waiting for the General Partners to complete the dissolution process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that \"The Partnership received net proceeds of $2,772,051 for its crane fleet and received $7,366,940 in distributions from DSC attributable to its interest in the proceeds from the sale of the DSC crane fleet.\" These two amounts represent the main financial outcomes of the Liquidating Sale. Additionally, the text explicitly mentions that \"the Partnership will not be dissolved prior to the resolution of the pending class action suit,\" which is preventing the immediate dissolution of the Partnership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it wrongly states that ongoing negotiations with Western are preventing the dissolution, which is not mentioned in the text.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it doesn't specify the breakdown of the proceeds and incorrectly states that the Partnership is waiting for SFN's approval to dissolve.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although it correctly states the total amount of proceeds, it doesn't provide the breakdown and incorrectly suggests that the Partnership is only waiting for the General Partners to complete the dissolution process, ignoring the pending class action suit."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "1321033_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1321033", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2: PROPERTIES\nWe currently lease approximately 126 facilities in 26 countries.
