The passage states that the Company manufactures plastic components at its own facilities and also manufactures certain other components, while purchasing the remaining components from outside suppliers.

They identified 300,000 square feet as excess space, but 70,000 square feet of that excess space is available for sublease. This means that 300,000 - 70,000 = 230,000 square feet is excess space that is not available for sublease.\n\nTo calculate the percentage:\n230,000 / 600,000 = 0.3833 or 38.3%\n\nB) 50% is incorrect because it represents the total excess space without considering the subleasable portion.\nC) 11.7% is incorrect as it only accounts for the subleasable excess space.\nD) 41.7% is incorrect; it's close but slightly overestimates the percentage."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "50725_2008.htm", "docs_id": "50725", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2008", "text": "Item 2.
