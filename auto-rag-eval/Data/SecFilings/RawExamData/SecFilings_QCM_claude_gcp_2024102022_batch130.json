The repetitive language used by each subsidiary (AEGCO, AEP, APCO, etc.) states that the information required for Item 8 is \"incorporated herein by reference to the financial statements and supplementary data described under Item 14 herein.\" This indicates that instead of providing separate financial statements in Item 8, all subsidiaries are referring to a consolidated set of financial statements and supplementary data located in Item 14 of the same document.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the pattern suggests a consolidated approach rather than separate statements for each subsidiary.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that the parent company likely consolidates the data, but it doesn't fully capture the specific reference to Item 14.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the subsidiaries are not exempt from providing financial statements; they are simply directing the reader to where this information can be found (Item 14).\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret SEC filing structures and understand how companies may organize and present financial information in regulatory documents."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "932111_1999.txt", "docs_id": "932111", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.
