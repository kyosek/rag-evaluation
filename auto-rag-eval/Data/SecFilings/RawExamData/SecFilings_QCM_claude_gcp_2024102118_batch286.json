According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's overall property arrangements?\n\nA) Hayes owns all of its facilities, including those in international locations.\nB) The company's leases for its Norcross facilities are set to expire within a year of each other, while its other domestic leases have varying expiration dates.\nC) Hayes subleases the majority of its Gaithersburg facility, while only a small portion of its Carlstadt facility is subleased.\nD) The company's manufacturing facility in Norcross occupies approximately one-third of the total leased space at that location.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the document clearly states that Hayes leases its facilities, including those in international locations.\n\nB is correct. The leases for the Norcross facilities (which include both executive offices and manufacturing/distribution facilities) expire between December 31, 1999 and September 30, 2000, which is within a year. The Gaithersburg lease expires on September 30, 1999, and the Carlstadt lease expires in September 2001, showing varying expiration dates for other domestic leases.\n\nC is incorrect. The document states that approximately 50% of the Gaithersburg facility is subleased, while a \"substantial portion\" of the Carlstadt facility is subleased. This suggests that more of the Carlstadt facility is likely subleased compared to the Gaithersburg facility.\n\nD is incorrect. The manufacturing facility in Norcross occupies approximately 50,000 square feet, while the total leased space in Norcross is 172,342 square feet. This means the manufacturing facility occupies about 29% of the total leased space, which is closer to one-quarter than one-third."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "2135_2005.htm", "docs_id": "2135", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.
