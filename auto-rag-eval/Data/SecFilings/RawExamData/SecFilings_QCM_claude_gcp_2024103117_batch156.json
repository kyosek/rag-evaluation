It captures the company's core business of designing and manufacturing display devices for various sectors, including their focus on high-end niche markets. It also acknowledges their additional roles in parts distribution and consumer support services. \n\nOption A is incomplete as it only mentions CRT displays and military applications, ignoring other display types and markets.

Based on the given information, what is the total annual rent for both facilities in 2006, and what percentage of this total is represented by the Ohio facility's rent?\n\nA) $506,000 total, with the Ohio facility representing 87.9% of the total\nB) $506,000 total, with the Ohio facility representing 88.9% of the total\nC) $521,000 total, with the Ohio facility representing 85.4% of the total\nD) $521,000 total, with the Ohio facility representing 86.4% of the total\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The New Hampshire facility's annual rent is stated as approximately $61,000. The Ohio facility's rent is given as approximately $445,000 annually. To calculate the total and percentage:\n\n1. Total annual rent: $61,000 + $445,000 = $506,000\n2. Percentage represented by Ohio facility: ($445,000 / $506,000) * 100 = 87.94%\n\nThis question is difficult because it requires careful reading of the document, accurate calculations, and consideration of the following factors:\n1. The New Hampshire lease expires in 2006, but we assume it's still valid for this calculation.\n2. The Ohio lease amount increases annually, but we use the stated amount for this calculation.\n3. Rounding to the nearest tenth for the percentage calculation.\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately represents both the total rent ($506,000) and the percentage (rounded to 87.9%) that the Ohio facility represents of this total."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "356028_2013.htm", "docs_id": "356028", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "Item 2.
