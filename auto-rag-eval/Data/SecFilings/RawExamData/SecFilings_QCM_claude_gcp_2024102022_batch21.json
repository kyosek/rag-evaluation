They own 5 facilities, including 3 in Houston and 2 in Louisiana. One of the Houston facilities was purchased in December 2013 for consolidation purposes. How many of their facilities are leased, and what percentage of their total facilities does this represent?\n\nA) 17 facilities leased, representing 73.9% of total facilities\nB) 18 facilities leased, representing 78.3% of total facilities\nC) 19 facilities leased, representing 82.6% of total facilities\nD) 20 facilities leased, representing 87.0% of total facilities\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The company has 23 total distribution centers. They own 5 facilities (3 in Houston and 2 in Louisiana). Therefore, the number of leased facilities is 23 - 5 = 18. To calculate the percentage, we divide the number of leased facilities by the total number of facilities: 18 / 23 = 0.7826, which is 78.3% when expressed as a percentage.
