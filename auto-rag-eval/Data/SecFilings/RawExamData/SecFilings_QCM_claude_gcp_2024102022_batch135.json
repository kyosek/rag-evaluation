To calculate the average annual increase in selling square footage, we take the difference between 2013 (3.547 million sq ft) and 2011 (3.026 million sq ft), which is 521,000 sq ft. Dividing this by 2 years gives an average annual increase of 260,500 sq ft.

Now, calculate for 4 more years of renewal:\n   Year 5: $35,437.98 * 1.02 = $36,146.74\n   Year 6: $36,146.74 * 1.02 = $36,869.67\n   Year 7: $36,869.67 * 1.02 = $37,607.07\n   Year 8: $37,607.07 * 1.02 = $38,359.21\n\n3.

The documentation clearly states that out of 302 retail centers, the company owns 164 and leases 138.
