The documentation states that the Company operates 68 dialysis centers, with five located in owned facilities and the remainder in leased facilities. This indicates a mix of owned and leased properties for dialysis centers. Additionally, it explicitly mentions that the Company owns 13,800 square feet of office space in Oak Park, Illinois for its corporate headquarters. The regional offices and additional corporate spaces (like the Bellwood facility) are described as leased. This combination of owned and leased properties, with the corporate headquarters being owned and most dialysis centers being leased, best matches option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all dialysis centers are leased (5 are owned), and the size range given (2,000 to 20,000 square feet) doesn't match the documented range of 3,000 to 15,000 square feet.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the corporate headquarters is explicitly stated as owned, not leased, and not all dialysis centers are owned.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the number of leased dialysis centers is close (63 vs. the actual 63), it incorrectly states that all corporate and regional offices are owned, when in fact only the corporate headquarters is owned and the regional offices are leased."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1098972_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1098972", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
