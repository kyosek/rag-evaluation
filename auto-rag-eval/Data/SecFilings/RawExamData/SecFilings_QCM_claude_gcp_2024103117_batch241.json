The Braintree, MA facility is 91,000 square feet and used for manufacturing. The company states they will need to relocate this manufacturing facility to a location to be determined. This implies they will likely need a similar amount of space for the relocated manufacturing operations, hence approximately 91,000 square feet.\n\nA is incorrect because the company still owns a 116,000 square foot facility in West Warwick, RI that includes manufacturing.\n\nC is incorrect because while Braintree (91,000 sq ft) represents about 44% of the total owned property (116,000 + 91,000 + 1,700 = 208,700 sq ft), the question states they will relocate, not eliminate, this facility.\n\nD is incorrect because the largest owned property will still be the 116,000 square foot facility in West Warwick, RI.
