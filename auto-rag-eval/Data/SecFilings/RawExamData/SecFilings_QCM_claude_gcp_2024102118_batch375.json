The documentation states that 4 New York Plaza has 900,000 square feet of space, which is smaller than the 1.3 million square feet at 270 Park Avenue. Additionally, the text mentions that the Corporation owns and occupies facilities in several locations in Texas (Hicksville, Houston, McAllen, Austin, Arlington, and El Paso), indicating significant holdings in that state.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it misstates the size of 4 New York Plaza and makes an unsupported claim about owning more than leasing.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it falsely states that 4 New York Plaza is the same size as 270 Park Avenue and makes an unsupported generalization about international offices.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, while it correctly states the size of 4 New York Plaza, it makes an unsupported claim about leasing more property than owning.

The company leases approximately 9,400 square feet in Bothell, Washington with a lease extension through January 2024. In Miami, Florida, the company leases 1,280 square feet of office space from a limited liability company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, who is a director and principal stockholder. This Miami lease has a three-year term with an optional three-year extension. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases, not owns, the Bothell facility, and the Miami space is leased from a related party, not an independent third party. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the company no longer maintains offices in Tucker, Georgia, having closed that location and terminated the lease.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company does lease space in both Bothell and Miami, the Miami lease is not a month-to-month agreement, but rather a three-year lease with an extension option.
