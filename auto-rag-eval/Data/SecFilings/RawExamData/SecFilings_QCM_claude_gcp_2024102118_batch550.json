This shows strategic alignment with agricultural cycles.

The Fort Worth location is leased, as stated in the document that the company \"leases all its premises except for the Tampa, Florida location.\"\n\nB) is incorrect because the Tampa property is not unencumbered. The document clearly states that \"As of December 31, 1996, the Tampa property was pledged as collateral under the Company's loan agreement with NationsBank, Texas, NA that matures April 30,1997.\"\n\nC) is incorrect because the New York City location is described as \"standard light industrial loft space in a multi-story building,\" not a standard office building with modern amenities.\n\nD) is correct. The document explicitly states that the Tampa property \"was pledged as collateral under the Company's loan agreement with NationsBank, Texas, NA that matures April 30,1997.\"\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret detailed property information, distinguishing between owned and leased properties, and understanding the financial obligations associated with the company's real estate holdings."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1171162_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1171162", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "ITEM 2.

Shorter initial lease terms (1-2 years) with multiple short-term renewal options offer several benefits:\n\n1. Flexibility: It allows the company to more easily adjust its retail footprint in response to changing market conditions or business needs.\n2. Risk mitigation: Short-term commitments reduce the risk of being locked into unfavorable locations or lease terms for extended periods.\n3. Negotiating power: Frequent renewal opportunities give the company more chances to renegotiate terms as market conditions change.\n4. Consistency with current practice: The document mentions renewal terms from one to five years, suggesting the company already values shorter-term commitments.\n\nOption A contradicts the company's apparent preference for flexibility. Option C, while potentially beneficial in some cases, ignores the reality that most leases include fixed components and might be too risky for landlords to accept widely.
