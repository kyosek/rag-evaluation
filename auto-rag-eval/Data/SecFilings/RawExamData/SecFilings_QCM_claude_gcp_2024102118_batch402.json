Additionally, it mentions that they expect to transfer the leases for divisional offices located in Tampa, Florida, Burlington, Massachusetts, and Franklin, Tennessee to Coventry Health Care.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SecFilings does not own the majority of its offices, and the transfer to Coventry Health Care involves leases, not ownership.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while SecFilings does own nine properties, the approximately 60 offices to be transferred are leased, not owned.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Addison, Texas office lease information is correct, SecFilings does not own all of its important divisional offices.
