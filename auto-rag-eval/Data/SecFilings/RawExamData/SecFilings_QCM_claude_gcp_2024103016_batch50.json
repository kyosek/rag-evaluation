This location is the most suitable for expanding rapid prototyping capabilities while minimizing real estate costs for the following reasons:\n\n1. The Westchester County facility is specifically mentioned as having \"rapid prototyping\" capabilities, which directly aligns with the company's expansion goals.\n\n2. At 11,000 sq. ft., it is the smallest facility, which would likely result in lower real estate costs compared to the other locations.\n\n3. The facility is leased, not owned, which provides more flexibility and potentially lower upfront costs for expansion.\n\n4. Other locations are primarily focused on injection molding and post-molding operations, which are not directly related to rapid prototyping.\n\n5. The larger facilities (Tucson, Battle Creek, Georgetown) would likely be more expensive to expand and may have excess capacity in areas not relevant to rapid prototyping.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex information, consider multiple factors (such as existing capabilities, facility size, and ownership status), and make a strategic decision based on the given criteria."}}
