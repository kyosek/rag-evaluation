If the company decides to consolidate its operations and reduce its total leased space by 25%, while maintaining its headquarters, approximately how many square feet of office space would it need to eliminate from its other locations?\n\nA) 82,500 square feet\nB) 112,500 square feet\nC) 132,500 square feet\nD) 182,500 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: D) 182,500 square feet\n\nExplanation: \nThe total leased space is 280,000 + 450,000 = 730,000 square feet.\nA 25% reduction would be 730,000 * 0.25 = 182,500 square feet.\nSince the company is maintaining its headquarters (280,000 sq ft), all of this reduction must come from the other locations.\nTherefore, the company needs to eliminate 182,500 square feet from its other locations to achieve a 25% overall reduction while keeping the headquarters intact.\n\nThis question tests the ability to perform multi-step calculations, understand percentage reductions, and apply the given information to a hypothetical scenario."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "755003_2007.htm", "docs_id": "755003", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2007", "text": "Item 2.

The document indicates that the company has engaged in strategic reduction of its manufacturing footprint by selling the idled coil coating facility in Elk Grove Village and closing the Middletown coil coating production facility. At the same time, the company maintains flexibility through leases with extension options, as evidenced by the footnotes mentioning lease extension possibilities for certain properties through 2027 and 2043. This approach allows the company to adjust its real estate portfolio over time while maintaining sufficient space (1,229,000 square feet) for current operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document clearly states that the company both owns and leases facilities.\nOption B is incorrect because there's no mention of recent expansion of manufacturing capabilities; in fact, the document discusses facility closures.\nOption C is partially correct in mentioning closures, but it overstates the extent of consolidation and doesn't capture the nuance of the company's strategy involving lease flexibility."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "868780_2013.htm", "docs_id": "868780", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2013", "text": "Item 2.
