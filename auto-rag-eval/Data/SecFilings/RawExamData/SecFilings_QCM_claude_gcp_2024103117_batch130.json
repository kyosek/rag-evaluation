The documentation states that the company is currently using approximately 25,000 square feet for manufacturing, research and development, and administrative offices. However, they are \"seeking to sublet\" the 7,000 square foot sales and marketing training facility. This indicates that they are trying to optimize their space usage by potentially leasing out the underutilized portion.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while they are using all 32,000 square feet, they are actively trying to sublet a portion, indicating plans for change.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because there's no mention of expansion plans. In fact, the document states they believe their current manufacturing facility \"has the capacity to meet our commercial needs for at least the next several years.\"\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while they have an office in Leuven, Belgium, there's no indication of plans to relocate their headquarters from Malvern, Pennsylvania."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1409430_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1409430", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.
