Subtract owned area from total US area: 7,642,000 - 6,236,000 = 1,406,000 sq ft\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum possible leased area in the US. This would occur if all the property outside the US (1,076,000 sq ft) were owned, allowing more of the US property to be leased.\n\nSo, the maximum leased area in the US would be:\nTotal US area - (Total owned area - Non-US area) = 7,642,000 - (6,236,000 - 1,076,000) = 2,482,000 sq ft\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 2,482,000 sq ft."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "865436_2001.txt", "docs_id": "865436", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

According to the documentation, the 53rd week in fiscal 2014 resulted in incremental fourth quarter revenue of approximately $15 million. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $8.1 million due to the enactment of the United States federal research tax credit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, they recorded a benefit for income taxes of $10.1 million for the same reason. Option A is incorrect because it states a decrease in revenue instead of an increase. Option B is incorrect because it mentions the $13.8 million tax benefit, which actually occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, not the fourth quarter. Option D is incorrect because it states no impact on revenue and incorrectly assigns the $13.8 million tax benefit to Q4 2014."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "1280263_2016.htm", "docs_id": "1280263", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2016", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur principal executive offices are located in Santa Clara, California, consisting of approximately 49,000 square feet of office space under a lease that expires in May 2020.
