Clinical Services operations in Greenwood Village, CO: $5,100 per month\n\nTotal monthly lease cost in March 2013: $4,147 + $5,100 = $9,247\n\nThe lease for the Clinical Services operations terminates on April 30, 2013. The headquarters lease extends until January 31, 2014. There's no mention of renewing the Clinical Services lease, so we can assume it won't continue.\n\nTherefore, starting February 2014, the company will only be paying for the headquarters lease, which is $4,147 per month.
