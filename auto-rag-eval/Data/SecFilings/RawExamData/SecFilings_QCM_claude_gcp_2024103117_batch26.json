Meanwhile, it's maintaining offices in other locations like San Diego, Kanata (Ontario), and near London, with leases extending into 2012 and 2013.

The documentation states that the Boston office lease is for approximately 41,000 square feet and expires on September 30, 2017, which matches the information in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it confuses the Chicago office details with Santa Ana. The Santa Ana office is actually the largest at 85,000 square feet and expires in 2020.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misattributes the Santa Ana office details to the Bolingbrook office. The Bolingbrook office is actually 20,000 square feet and expires on March 31, 2014.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it combines details from the Chicago and Bolingbrook offices incorrectly.
