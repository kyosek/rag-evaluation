If 114,000 square feet is leased to Reliant Resources, and the company leases an additional 7,100 square feet at CenterPoint Energy's principal office building, how much space does the company occupy in its own central support facility?\n\nA) 399,900 square feet\nB) 407,000 square feet\nC) 414,100 square feet\nD) 521,000 square feet\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires careful reading and calculation. The total central support facility is 521,000 square feet. Of this, 114,000 square feet is leased to Reliant Resources. The company also leases 7,100 square feet at a separate location (CenterPoint Energy's building). To find how much space the company occupies in its own central support facility, we need to subtract the space leased to Reliant Resources from the total:\n\n521,000 - 114,000 = 407,000 square feet\n\nThis matches the information given in the passage: \"approximately 407,000 square feet is occupied by us\".\n\nOption A is incorrect as it subtracts both the space leased to Reliant and the space leased at CenterPoint Energy.\nOption C is incorrect as it adds the space leased at CenterPoint Energy to the space occupied in the central facility.\nOption D is incorrect as it represents the total space of the central support facility, not just the space occupied by the company."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "1041429_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1041429", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2.

Distribution center: The company leases \"approximately 1.1 million square feet of space in Coppell, Texas for our corporate offices and distribution center.\"\n3. Manufacturing facilities: Elfa, which seems to be a subsidiary or division of the company, \"owns four manufacturing facilities\" in various locations in Sweden, Poland, and Finland.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases, not owns, its retail locations.\nOption B is close, but not entirely correct. While the company does lease all retail locations and the distribution center, it doesn't own all manufacturing facilities (Elfa leases its headquarters in Malm\u00f6, Sweden).\nOption C is the most accurate. It correctly identifies that retail locations and the distribution center are leased, and that some manufacturing facilities are owned (the four mentioned), while at least one (Elfa's headquarters) is leased.\nOption D is incorrect because it states all properties are leased, which contradicts the information about owned manufacturing facilities.\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the given information."}}
