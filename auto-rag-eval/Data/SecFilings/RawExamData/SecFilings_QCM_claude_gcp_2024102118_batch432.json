The documentation explicitly states that if SecFilings were required to relocate any of their towers, \"the cost could be significant.\" This is due to several factors mentioned in the text:\n\n1.

Based on the information provided, which location would be the best candidate for immediate renegotiation or relocation, considering lease expiration, size, and strategic importance?\n\nA) Norcross, GA\nB) Los Angeles, CA\nC) Miami, FL\nD) Toronto, Canada\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. While Norcross, GA has the largest floor area (156,000 sq ft) and a significant annual rent ($546,700), its lease doesn't expire until December 31, 1999. It's also described as the company's largest distribution center and new location for executive offices, indicating strategic importance.\n\nB) Correct. The Los Angeles, CA location has the earliest lease expiration date (March 31, 1997) among all locations. It's relatively small (28,100 sq ft) compared to other locations, and its annual rent ($105,000) is moderate. This combination of factors makes it the best candidate for immediate renegotiation or relocation, offering the company the most immediate flexibility without disrupting larger or more strategically important locations.\n\nC) Incorrect. Although Miami, FL has a similar size to Los Angeles (28,800 sq ft), its lease doesn't expire until October 31, 2000, which is one of the latest expiration dates in the portfolio. Additionally, it has a higher annual rent ($213,000) compared to Los Angeles.\n\nD) Incorrect. Toronto, Canada has a relatively large floor area (34,100 sq ft) and a lease expiration date of April 30, 2000. While its annual rent ($90,300) is lower than some other locations, the later expiration date and larger size make it less suitable for immediate action compared to Los Angeles.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze multiple factors (lease expiration, size, rent, and strategic importance) to make a strategic real estate decision, requiring a thorough understanding of the provided data and business considerations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "277375_1998.txt", "docs_id": "277375", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 8.
