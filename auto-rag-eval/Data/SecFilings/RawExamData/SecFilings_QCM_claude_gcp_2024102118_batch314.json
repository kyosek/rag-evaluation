Calculate the total annual lease expense\n2. Determine what percentage of that total is for billboard advertising sites\n\nTotal annual lease expense = Facility lease expense + Billboard site lease expense\nTotal = $7.6 million + $225.7 million = $233.3 million\n\nBillboard site lease expense percentage = (Billboard lease expense / Total lease expense) x 100\n= ($225.7 million / $233.3 million) x 100\n= 0.9673 x 100\n= 96.7%\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a dense text, perform multi-step calculations, and calculate percentages.

The question provides information on 54 fully owned locations and 31 locations where only the building is owned.\n   54 + 31 = 85 locations with known ownership status\n\n2. However, this is not the total number of locations. The passage states \"The majority of the Company's retail stores are leased.\" This implies that there are more leased locations not accounted for in the 85.\n\n3. To find the percentage of fully owned locations, we use:\n   (Fully owned locations / Total locations) x 100\n\n4. 54 / 85 = 63.5%, which might seem correct (option A), but this is a trap because it doesn't account for the majority of leased stores.\n\n5.

Corporate headquarters:\n   - Monthly base rate: $49,903\n   - Monthly operating costs: $4,000\n   - Total monthly cost: $53,903\n   - Annual cost: $53,903 * 12 = $646,836\n\n2.
