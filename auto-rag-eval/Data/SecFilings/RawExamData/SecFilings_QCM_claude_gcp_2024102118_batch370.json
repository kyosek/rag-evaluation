The information provided strongly suggests that this company is in the construction materials or mining industry, specifically dealing with aggregates. Key indicators include:\n\n1. The company has 3.9 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves, which is a massive amount typically associated with construction materials or mining operations.\n\n2. They operate over 400 sites and plants, indicating a large-scale industrial operation rather than a tech company or real estate developer.\n\n3.
