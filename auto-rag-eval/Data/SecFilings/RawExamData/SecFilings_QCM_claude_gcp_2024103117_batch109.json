The correct answer is C because the document states that the original lease for 93,000 square feet in San Diego expired in April 2010, and a new sublease for approximately 34,000 square feet began on May 1, 2010. This represents a reduction of about 63% in office space (from 93,000 to 34,000 square feet).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the original lease expired in April 2010.

However, the documentation states that the company will \"continue to explore\" opportunities for development or sale of the leasehold interest. This suggests that while the company has reduced the carrying value of the asset on its books (reflecting the impairment), it is not abandoning the lease entirely. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company is maintaining the lease with minimum payments of $180 per month.
