PROPERTIES\nOn September 30, 1991, Farmer Mac entered into a long-term lease for its principal offices, which are located at 919 18th Street, N.W., Suite 200, Washington, D.C. 20006. The lease, which is for a term of ten years, covers approximately 7,500 square feet of office space. Farmer Mac has the option to terminate the lease at the end of the fifth lease year (January 1997) upon the payment of a termination fee of $400,000 (an amount representing approximately 20 months' rent). See Note 12 to the Financial Statements attached hereto. Farmer Mac's offices are suitable and adequate for its present needs and the rent paid by Farmer Mac under the lease is consistent with current market rates for comparable office space in the District of Columbia. Because full implementation of the new authorities granted to Farmer Mac in the 1996 Act may result in the expansion of Farmer Mac's staff and equipment and perhaps the need for larger facilities, Farmer Mac is considering alternatives to its current lease arrangement.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Question: Farmer Mac's lease agreement for its principal offices includes which of the following features?\n\nA) The option to terminate the lease after 3 years with a $400,000 fee\nB) A 10-year term for approximately 7,500 square feet of office space\nC) The ability to expand the office space without additional cost\nD) A below-market rental rate for comparable office space in Washington D.C.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. According to the documentation, Farmer Mac entered into a long-term lease on September 30, 1991, for its principal offices. The lease is explicitly stated to be for a term of ten years and covers approximately 7,500 square feet of office space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there is an option to terminate the lease early, it's after 5 years (not 3) and would be in January 1997.\n\nOption C is incorrect as there's no mention of the ability to expand the office space without additional cost. In fact, the document suggests that Farmer Mac is considering alternatives to its current lease arrangement due to potential expansion needs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document states that the rent paid by Farmer Mac is \"consistent with current market rates for comparable office space in the District of Columbia,\" not below market rate."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "1436126_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1436126", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "ITEM 1.
