The passage states that the \"older New Britain facility is well equipped and maintained but less favorably arranged for operating efficiencies.\" However, it also mentions that \"Management considers all of the distribution centers to be in satisfactory condition.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Jacksonville was constructed within the last eight years, it is not the largest facility. New Britain is the largest at 92,000 square feet.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that Lemont is the smallest at 44,000 square feet and is well equipped, but this is true for Jacksonville and Visalia as well, so it's not a distinguishing characteristic.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Visalia, along with Jacksonville and Lemont, is described as \"well equipped and laid out for operating efficiencies.\"\n\nThe question tests the ability to carefully read and synthesize information from different parts of the passage, distinguishing between general statements about multiple facilities and specific details about individual locations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1528059_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1528059", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.
