If the company decides to terminate the lease early on March 31, 2022, what would be the financial penalty, and how much notice must they provide?\n\nA) 3 months' rent as penalty, with 3 months' advance notice\nB) 6 months' rent as penalty, with 6 months' advance notice\nC) 3 months' rent as penalty, with 6 months' advance notice\nD) No penalty, but must provide 6 months' advance notice\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the lease terms, if either party wishes to terminate the lease on March 31, 2022, they must provide six months' advance notice and pay the non-terminating party three months' rent as a penalty. Option C correctly combines these two requirements: 3 months' rent as penalty, with 6 months' advance notice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it pairs the wrong penalty with insufficient notice period.
