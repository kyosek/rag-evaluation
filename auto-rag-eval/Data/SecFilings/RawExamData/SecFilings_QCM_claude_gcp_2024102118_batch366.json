The company is clearly in the development stage, has launched two browser applications (Xyberhome and Clustertabs), and has a limited user base of approximately 30,000. The document also mentions plans for both further development and marketing efforts in the future.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the company has launched products, they are not described as stable, and the user base is relatively small. The company plans to focus on marketing but not exclusively, as further development is also mentioned.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the document explicitly states that the company has no full-time employees, and the president is only dedicating a limited amount of time (no more than 10 hours per month) to the company's affairs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company has adapted its products for multiple browsers, there's no mention of profitability.

The subtenant does not have a direct contractual relationship with the property owner under a sublease arrangement.

The company is expanding its corporate space and will see an overall increase in lease costs for 1999 when including new acquisitions. This can be inferred from several pieces of information:\n\n1. The company is moving to a new corporate headquarters with approximately 30,000 square feet, up from 21,000 square feet, indicating expansion.\n2. While the lease costs for existing facilities as of December 31, 1998, are expected to decrease slightly from $8,400,000 to $7,980,000 in 1999, the company mentions additional lease costs of approximately $55,880 for hospitals acquired between December 31, 1998, and March 25, 1999.\n3. The new corporate headquarters lease will cost approximately $47,000 per month, which is an additional expense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company is expanding, not downsizing its headquarters.\nOption C is incorrect because the company owns only 73 facilities out of 211, which is not a majority.\nOption D is incorrect because the lease costs are changing and additional costs are being added due to new acquisitions and the headquarters move."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "1066244_1998.txt", "docs_id": "1066244", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. ----------\nAs of October 31, 1998, the Company provided textile rental services from 40 facilities. The Company owns 21 of its facilities, including its corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York, and leases the balance of its facilities pursuant to leases expiring between February 1999 and October 2003 with options to renew in most cases, except for leases for certain garages and small distribution facilities which are leased on a month-to-month basis. The Company's facilities consist of laundry plants and laundry terminals. A laundry plant processes and delivers textile rental products to customers or to laundry terminals. A laundry terminal does not engage in production work, but collects soiled inventory, transports it to the laundry plant for processing and delivers processed inventory to customers.

Total facilities = 40\n2. Owned facilities = 21\n3. Leased facilities = 40 - 21 = 19\n4. The question states that leases expire \"between February 1999 and October 2003 with options to renew in most cases, except for leases for certain garages and small distribution facilities which are leased on a month-to-month basis.\"\n5. We need to find how many of the 19 leased facilities are month-to-month.\n6. The trick is in the wording about owned facilities: \"The Company owns 21 of its facilities, including its corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York\". This implies that the corporate headquarters is counted in the 21 owned facilities.\n7. However, the question also mentions \"** Company owns laundry plant but leases garage.\" This suggests that for at least one facility, the plant is owned but the garage is leased month-to-month.\n8. Therefore, the number of month-to-month leases is actually 19 (total leased) + 1 (garage leased for an owned plant) = 20.\n9. But we need to subtract the 3 facilities financed by industrial revenue bonds, as these are likely on fixed-term leases.\n10. Final answer: 20 - 3 = 17 facilities are leased on a month-to-month basis.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex information, make inferences, and perform multi-step calculations."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "46619_1995.txt", "docs_id": "46619", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1995", "text": "ITEM 2.

Some medical imaging centers are in leased spaces, while others are in owned condominium suites.
