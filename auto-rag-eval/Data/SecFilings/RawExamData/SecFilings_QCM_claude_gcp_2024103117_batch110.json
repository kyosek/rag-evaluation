The Waltham facility changed during 2006, with the lease at Beaver Street expiring on November 15, 2006. This means the $1.8 million rental cost likely includes some expenses for both locations. Additionally, the $1.6 million sublease income is specifically stated to be for 2006.\n\nFor San Francisco, we're given the average yearly base rent, but the sublease income is specifically for 2006. This suggests the actual rental cost for 2006 might have been higher than the average.\n\nGiven these factors, the net annual cost for 2006 would be higher than the simple calculation of $2.5 million.
