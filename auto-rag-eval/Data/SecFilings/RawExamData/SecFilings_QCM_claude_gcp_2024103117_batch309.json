According to the documentation, 407 out of 456 outpatient dialysis centers were located in leased facilities as of December 31, 2005. This calculates to 89.3% of centers being leased (407 / 456 = 0.893 or 89.3%).\n\nThe most likely reason for this leasing strategy is to minimize long-term financial commitments and adapt to changing market conditions. This is supported by several factors in the text:\n\n1. The leases have varying terms (1 to 15 years) with renewal options, providing flexibility.\n2. Expansion or relocation is subject to Medicare ESRD program compliance and often requires certificates of need in certain states, which can change over time.\n3. Leasing allows the company to more easily adapt to these regulatory requirements and market changes without the long-term commitment of owning properties.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the percentage is correct, the reason is not the primary driver of the leasing strategy.
