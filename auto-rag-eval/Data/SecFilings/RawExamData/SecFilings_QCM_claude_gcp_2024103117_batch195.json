Given that land use rights for industrial purposes in China are typically granted for a maximum of 50 years, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's expansion plans?\n\nA) The company will need to acquire additional land use rights immediately to proceed with expansion.\n\nB) The company can expand without concerns, as land use rights in China are perpetual for industrial use.\n\nC) The company likely has sufficient land for expansion but should consider the renewal process for land use rights in their long-term planning.\n\nD) The company's expansion plans are irrelevant to their land use rights situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage states that the company believes they \"currently have enough land to satisfy such expansion,\" indicating they don't need to acquire additional land immediately (ruling out A). However, land use rights in China for industrial purposes are not perpetual but granted for a maximum of 50 years (ruling out B). While the company can proceed with their expansion plans on their current land, they should be aware that these rights will need to be renewed in the future. This makes long-term planning important, considering the renewal process. Answer D is incorrect because the expansion plans are directly related to their land use rights situation.

Boca Raton: $8,700/month for 23 months (Jan 2003 - Nov 2004) = $200,100\n2. Fort Lauderdale: $900/month for 23 months = $20,700\n3.
