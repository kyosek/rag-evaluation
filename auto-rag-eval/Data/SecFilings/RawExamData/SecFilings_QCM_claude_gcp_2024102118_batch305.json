The text states that BackWeb leased approximately 3,234 square feet in Rosh Ha'ayin, Israel, and 17,600 square feet in San Jose, California, which totals 20,834 square feet across these two main locations.

According to the documentation, the Bank owns its headquarters in Granite Falls and banking offices in several North Carolina cities (Conover, Cornelius, Granite Falls, Hickory, Hudson, Lenoir, Morganton, Newton, and Wilkesboro). The Bank leases offices in five other locations: Boone, Charlotte, Granite Falls, Matthews, and Winston-Salem. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Company indirectly owns real estate through its ownership of the Bank and Granite Mortgage, and it doesn't directly own all banking offices, especially not those in Charlotte and Winston-Salem which are leased.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Granite Mortgage leases its headquarters in Winston-Salem and all its mortgage origination offices across North Carolina.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it reverses the ownership and leasing arrangements for both the Bank and Granite Mortgage.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to carefully parse complex information about property ownership and leasing across multiple entities and locations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "789868_2011.htm", "docs_id": "789868", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2011", "text": "Item 2.

The documentation states that properties marked with an asterisk are leased under operating leases, and those with a double asterisk are leased under capital leases. Therefore, not all properties are owned.\n\nB) Incorrect. Properties marked with a single asterisk are leased under operating leases, not capital leases. Double asterisks indicate capital leases.\n\nC) Incorrect.
