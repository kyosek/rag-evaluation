According to the documentation, in April 2008, Schering-Plough announced as part of the Productivity Transformation Program that there would be a reduction in the number of plants worldwide. The goal of this program was to create a more focused and high-efficiency network of plants by 2012. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of a Global Expansion Program, and the goal was to reduce plants, not increase production capacity. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while the document mentions research facilities, there's no specific plan mentioned for optimizing them.
