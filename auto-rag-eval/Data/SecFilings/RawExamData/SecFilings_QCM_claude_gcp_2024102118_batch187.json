The annual depreciation expense is calculated as the property's cost divided by its useful life: $10,000,000 / 40 years = $250,000 per year. The straight-line depreciation method, as mentioned in the documentation (\"Depreciation is taken on each property on a straight-line basis\"), results in a constant annual depreciation expense over the property's useful life. This method causes the property's book value to decrease steadily each year.\n\nThe impact on financial statements over time is that the property's book value will continue to decrease at a constant rate, while the actual market value may not depreciate as quickly or may even appreciate. This can potentially lead to overstating the property's value in later years of its useful life, as the book value may be significantly lower than the property's actual market value.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they either state the wrong annual depreciation amount or incorrectly describe the impact of straight-line depreciation.

Penney Company, Inc.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests the ability to interpret and combine multiple pieces of information from the text. The correct answer is B because:\n1. The lease is for 25 years, and 23 years have expired, leaving 2 years remaining.\n2. J.C. Penney Company, Inc. has subleased nine floors for offices, which is the majority of the 14-story building.\n3. Zions Bancorporation's subsidiaries have leased only the ground floor and two other floors (3 floors total).\n4. The remaining two floors are sublet to various tenants.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Zions Bancorporation doesn't occupy the majority of the building. Option C is incorrect because the lease has 2 years remaining, not 23, and the subsidiaries don't occupy most of the building. Option D is incorrect because the lease hasn't expired and the building isn't equally shared between the two companies."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "892112_2004.htm", "docs_id": "892112", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.

The correct answer is C because the document states that the Partnership participated in drilling 44 oil and gas wells, but then specifies that \"One well was sold and one well was plugged and abandoned due to uneconomical operations.\" This leaves 42 producing wells, which is confirmed by the statement \"At December 31, 1998, the Partnership had 42 producing oil and gas wells.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the two wells that were no longer productive. Answer B is close but misses the fact that one well was plugged and abandoned, not just sold.
