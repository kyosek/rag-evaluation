How is this gain being treated in accordance with SFAS No. 28 \"Accounting for Sales with Leaseback\", and what impact does this have on the company's financial statements?\n\nA) The gain is recognized immediately in full on the income statement, improving the company's profitability for the year of the transaction.\n\nB) The gain is deferred and amortized over the terms of the individual lease-back agreements, gradually impacting the income statement over time.\n\nC) The gain is held as a liability on the balance sheet indefinitely, with no impact on the income statement.\n\nD) The gain is split, with half recognized immediately and half deferred and amortized over the lease term.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, \"In accordance with SFAS No. 28 'Accounting for Sales with Leaseback', the gain has been deferred and is being amortized over the terms of the individual lease-back agreements.\" This means that instead of recognizing the entire $0.8 million gain immediately, the company is spreading it out over the duration of the lease-back agreements. This approach results in a gradual positive impact on the income statement over time, rather than a one-time boost to profitability.
