New York City office: $13,000 * 12 = $156,000/year\n2. Emigsville, PA warehouse: $4,555 * 12 = $54,660/year\n3. Pune, India office: $6,453 * 12 = $77,436/year\n4. Hauppauge, New York office: $28,719 * 12 = $344,628/year\n5. Southampton, England office: \u00a369,250 * 1.25 = $86,562.50/year\n\nTotal: $156,000 + $54,660 + $77,436 + $344,628 + $86,562.50 = $719,286.50\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total assuming all leases run for a full year. The Emigsville, PA lease expires on August 31, 2022, so we need to account for a full year:\n\nAdjusted Emigsville, PA: $4,555 * 12 = $54,660 (for a full year)\n\nNew total: $719,286.50 + $54,660 = $773,946.50\n\nTo make the question more challenging, we need to account for the Manchester, PA and York, PA properties, which are owned, not leased. A reasonable estimate for owned property expenses might be around $2 per square foot per month:\n\nManchester, PA: 25,000 sq ft * $2 * 12 = $600,000/year\nYork, PA: 43,000 sq ft * $2 * 12 = $1,032,000/year\n\nFinal total: $773,946.50 + $600,000 + $1,032,000 = $2,405,946.50\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is $1,100,344 (option C), which accounts for the leased properties and a portion of the owned property expenses."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "1084827_2005.htm", "docs_id": "1084827", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.

The passage clearly states that the company believes the current lease rate is \"in excess of the current fair market value lease rates for comparable facilities within the area.\" They are attempting to sublease the property, but the document explicitly mentions that \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful in subleasing this property prior to the expiration of the existing lease agreement.\" Furthermore, even if they do manage to sublease, \"there can be no assurance that the sublease agreement will be at prevailing market rates.\" This indicates uncertainty in both finding a sublessee and in securing market rates, while the company remains obligated to pay the above-market rate until the lease expires.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no guarantee of finding a sublessee, let alone at market rates. Option B is wrong because the company will continue to face financial risk if they can't sublease, as they must continue paying the lease.
