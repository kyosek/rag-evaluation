When a SEC filing states that information is \"incorporated herein by reference,\" it typically means that the required information is already presented elsewhere in the document or in another filing. This practice is used to avoid redundancy and to streamline the document. In this case, all the companies mentioned are referring to \"the financial statements and supplementary data described under Item 14\" for the information required in Item 8.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because complexity is not the reason for incorporation by reference. Answer B is incorrect as this is a standard, transparent practice, not an attempt to conceal information.

The Bank owns the Ross Township branch office.\n4. The Bank owns the Pine Creek branch office building, but leases the land.\n5. The Bank owns the West View branch office.\n\nIn total, the Bank fully owns (both building and land) 4 branch offices: the main office on Federal Street, Cranberry Township, Ross Township, and West View. The Pine Creek office is not counted as fully owned because the land is leased.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect as they underestimate the number of fully owned branches.
