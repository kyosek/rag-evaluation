The passage states that Laclede Gas has \"more than 16,000 miles of gas main and related service pipes, meters, and regulators.\" It also mentions \"regional office buildings,\" \"underground natural gas and propane storage facilities,\" and a headquarters office building that is under lease. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it understates the miles of gas main (16,000 miles, not 10,000) and doesn't mention the crucial underground storage facilities.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it overstates the miles of gas distribution network (16,000 miles, not 20,000) and doesn't mention important components like meters and regulators.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't mention the extensive gas main network, which is a primary component of the utility infrastructure.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from different parts of the passage and identify the most comprehensive and accurate summary of Laclede Gas' utility properties."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "894671_2004.txt", "docs_id": "894671", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOhio Valley's consolidated financial statements and related notes are listed below and incorporated herein by reference to pages 6-26 of Ohio Valley's 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Let's break down the options:\n\nA) Incorrect. The Los Angeles warehouse lease expires in June 2001, which is indeed the earliest, but the question is set in 2005, by which time this lease would have already expired or been renewed.\n\nB) Correct. The executive offices lease in Century City expires in January 2006, which is the most pressing issue given the 2005 timeframe mentioned in the question. This would require immediate attention for renewal or relocation planning.\n\nC) Incorrect. While the Operations Center lease in Inglewood does extend to October 2006, it is not the longest lease mentioned. The Memphis warehouse lease extends to August 2006, which is later.\n\nD) Incorrect. Although the Memphis warehouse lease does extend to August 2006, making it the longest of the mentioned leases, it does not provide the \"longest-term stability\" in the context of a company planning in 2005, as the executive offices lease expiring in January 2006 would be a more immediate concern.\n\nThe correct answer is B because, given the 2005 planning timeframe, the executive offices lease expiring in January 2006 would be the most pressing issue requiring immediate attention."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "723254_2004.htm", "docs_id": "723254", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nCintas occupies 351 facilities located in 260 cities, of which 165 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from monthly to the year 2019.
