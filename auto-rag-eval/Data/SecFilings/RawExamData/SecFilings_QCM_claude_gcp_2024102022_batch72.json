Additionally, the text mentions that ISP \"maintains sales offices and warehouses in the United States and abroad, substantially all of which are in leased premises under relatively short-term leases.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all facilities are owned outright, and the headquarters is subject to a mortgage.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while many properties are leased, the leases are described as \"relatively short-term\" rather than long-term contracts.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the facilities \"have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition, are suitable for their respective operations and generally provide sufficient capacity to meet production requirements.\"\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to synthesize information from different parts of the text and accurately represent the company's real estate situation."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "933020_2001.txt", "docs_id": "933020", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

According to the documentation, Arrow owns twenty-seven branch banking offices and leases thirteen. Additionally, the insurance agency is co-located in six bank-owned branches and three leased offices, totaling nine locations. This statement accurately reflects the information provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Arrow does not own all of its branch banking offices; it leases thirteen of them. \n\nOption B is false on two counts: Arrow owns more branch offices (27) than it leases (13), and its main office is in Glens Falls, not Saratoga Springs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the main office in Glens Falls is explicitly stated to be owned by the company, not leased.
