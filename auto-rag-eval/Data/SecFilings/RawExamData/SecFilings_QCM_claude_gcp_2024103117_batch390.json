The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. In December 2013, CloudBiz acquired 69% of the company by purchasing 15,730 shares.\n2.

CloudBiz owns 74,015,730 of these shares, which is about 99.97% of the total.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it confuses the July 2014 investment with the initial December 2013 transaction. \nOption B is incorrect because the October 2014 share issuance was too small to significantly dilute CloudBiz's ownership.\nOption D is technically correct but doesn't fully capture the extent of CloudBiz's ownership, making it less comprehensive than option C."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "815917_1993.txt", "docs_id": "815917", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1993", "text": "ITEM 2.

The company owns a large amount of office space (approximately 1,000,000 square feet) across multiple states, indicating a significant workforce and distributed operations.\n2. They have both owned and leased office facilities in numerous states, suggesting a need to be close to their clients.\n3.
