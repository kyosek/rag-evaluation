If all leases were to expire today, which division would have the longest remaining lease term, and how many square feet of space would that represent?\n\nA) Instrument Division in San Ramon, 47,300 sq ft\nB) ASCOR in Fremont, 18,700 sq ft\nC) Microsource in Santa Rosa, 33,400 sq ft\nD) ASCOR in Fremont, 11,000 sq ft\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires careful analysis of the lease expiration dates and square footage for each division. The Instrument Division's lease in San Ramon expires on December 31, 2006, which is the earliest. ASCOR's lease in Fremont expires on June 30, 2009, but includes 7,700 sq ft of abandoned space, leaving effectively 11,000 sq ft (18,700 - 7,700). Microsource's lease in Santa Rosa expires on May 25, 2013, which is the latest date mentioned. Therefore, Microsource would have the longest remaining lease term, and it occupies 33,400 sq ft. Option D is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that ASCOR effectively uses less space than leased, it's not the division with the longest remaining lease term."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1301991_2012.htm", "docs_id": "1301991", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2012", "text": "Item 2.

The question asks for the most accurate statement regarding the company's property situation as of December 31, 2015, with a focus on the next 5 years.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the South San Francisco lease expires in April 2020, which is within 5 years, it's not the most immediate concern or the most accurate statement overall.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Singapore lease expires in June 2022, which doesn't extend beyond 2020 and isn't the longest-term commitment mentioned.\n\nOption C is correct because the new facility in Ontario, Canada has a lease that \"expires 10 years from April 1, 2016.\" This means the lease extends to 2026, which is the longest commitment mentioned and falls within the 5-year planning horizon specified in the question.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the company does have leases in Japan and China, the passage also mentions a lease in France.
