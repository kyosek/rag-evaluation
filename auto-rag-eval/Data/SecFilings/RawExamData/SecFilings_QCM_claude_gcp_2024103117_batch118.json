While the occupancy rates for Las Brisas Apartment have improved in recent years, reaching 98.4% in 2003, the Partnership may still face challenges in making the lump-sum payment of approximately $3,447,000 due on December 31, 2011. This is because:\n\n1. The occupancy rates, while improved, have fluctuated over the years (dropping as low as 92.7% in 2001).\n2. The lump-sum payment is a significant amount, which may be challenging to accumulate even with high occupancy rates.\n3. The question directs readers to additional information in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section, suggesting there may be other factors affecting the Partnership's liquidity and capital resources.\n4. The property was purchased in 1986, indicating it's an older property that may require maintenance or renovations, potentially impacting cash flow.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while occupancy rates are high, this alone doesn't guarantee easy payment. Option B is incorrect because occupancy rates have actually improved, not declined. Option D is incorrect because occupancy rates are relevant to the property's performance and cash flow, which affect the ability to make payments."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "940716_1998.txt", "docs_id": "940716", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.
