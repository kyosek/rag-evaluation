The annual depreciation expense is calculated by dividing the property's cost by its useful life: $10,000,000 / 40 years = $250,000 per year. Straight-line depreciation, as mentioned in the document (\"Depreciation is taken on each property on a straight-line basis\"), means the expense remains constant each year. This method results in an even decrease in the property's book value annually. However, it may not accurately reflect the property's actual depreciation or market value over time, potentially overstating the property's value in later years as real estate often appreciates or depreciates at different rates.
