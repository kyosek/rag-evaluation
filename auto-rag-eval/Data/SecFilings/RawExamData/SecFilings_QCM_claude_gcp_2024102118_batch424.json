Option A is incorrect because the Company leases both facilities, not owning either. Option B is incorrect because the Carrollton lease extends through March 2014, while the Plano lease extends through February 2014, so the Carrollton lease actually expires after the Plano lease. Option C is incorrect because the Chaville lease extends only through June 2011, which is the earliest expiration of the three leases mentioned. Option D is correct because the text states that the Company leases facilities in Plano, Carrollton, and Chaville, and also mentions that \"The Company owns most of the equipment used in its operations.
