Original sublease (28,000 sq ft) + Additional space (10,000 sq ft):\n   Monthly rent: $141,276\n   Annual rent: $141,276 * 12 = $1,695,312\n\n2.

Most of the Company's stores have lease terms of approximately ten years and generally do not contain renewal options. The Company has not in the past experienced problems renewing its leases, although no assurance can be given that the Company can renew existing leases on favorable terms. The Company seeks to negotiate extensions on leases for stores undergoing remodeling to provide terms of approximately ten years after completion of remodeling. Consent of the landlord generally is required to remodel or change the name under which the Company does business. The Company has not in the past experienced problems in obtaining such consent. Most leases provide for a fixed minimum rental plus an additional rental cost based upon a set percentage of sales beyond a specified breakpoint, plus common area and other charges.\nThe current terms of the Company's leases, including automatic renewal options, expire as follows:\nThe corporate headquarters and distribution center for the Company operate within a facility purchased by the Company in 1988, and located in Kearney, NE.

The passage explicitly states that \"The corporate headquarters and distribution center for the Company operate within a facility purchased by the Company in 1988, and located in Kearney, NE. The building provides approximately 179,000 square feet of space.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while this describes the typical lease arrangement for the Company's store locations, it does not apply to the corporate headquarters and distribution center, which is owned, not leased.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage states that \"over 70% of the area being allocated for the distribution and returns-to-vendor departments,\" not retail operations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage mentions that \"The Company has not in the past experienced problems in obtaining such consent\" regarding landlord approval for remodeling. Moreover, this facility is owned by the Company, not leased, so landlord consent would not be applicable.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to distinguish between information about the Company's typical store properties and its corporate headquarters/distribution center, as well as careful attention to specific details provided in the passage."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "916545_2001.txt", "docs_id": "916545", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "ITEM 2 PROPERTIES ----------\nThe Company owns no real estate.

Total floor space = 14.1 million sq ft\n   Owned percentage = 52%\n   Owned floor space = 14.1 million * 0.52 = 7.332 million sq ft\n\n2.

The question asks for the percentage of owned space that was sold and leased back.\n\nThe next closest option is 27%, which is approximately half of 52%.

The question states that regional buying center sizes range from 3,000 to 14,000 sq ft. Since 14,000 sq ft is less than 71,000 sq ft, all regional buying centers are smaller. The document lists 18 regional buying centers, but Atlanta and Minneapolis are mentioned twice (once in the list of cities and once separately), so there are actually 16 unique regional buying centers.

While iVillage does have two leased spaces in New York, they total 125,000 square feet (105,000 at 500-512 Seventh Avenue and 20,000 at 149 Fifth Avenue), but only the 105,000 square feet is confirmed as their headquarters.\n\nB) is incorrect.

While some leases are expiring soon (like the one in Chicago which is month-to-month, and the one in San Diego expiring in November 2001), others have longer terms.
