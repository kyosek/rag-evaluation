While it might seem that expiring leases would lead to decreased expenses, this is often not the case in real-world scenarios. Several factors support this conclusion:\n\n1. The company states that it believes its current facilities are adequate for near-term requirements, suggesting they will likely need to either renew these leases or find similar spaces.\n2. Lease renewals often come with increased rates, especially for long-term tenants.\n3. If the company needs to relocate, this usually involves significant costs for moving and potentially upgrading new spaces.\n4. The company has multiple other leased spaces globally, which may also face renewals or relocations over time.\n5. As companies grow, they often require more space, leading to increased rental costs.\n\nOptions A and B are unlikely because the expiration of leases doesn't necessarily lead to decreased expenses, especially when considering the need for continued operations.

The document states that the company owns its principal properties in fee, subject to defects and encumbrances that do not materially interfere with their use. Additionally, substantially all of the property is subject to a mortgage lien. For electric lines, the company has obtained right-of-way grants from apparent owners for most lines, but not all. Some lines are on public property with revocable permissions, and in some cases, rights-of-way could be acquired through condemnation if necessary. This mix of ownership, mortgages, and various right-of-way arrangements is best captured by option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores the mortgage liens and encumbrances mentioned. Option B is incorrect because it fails to account for lines on public property and the fact that not all right-of-way grants have been obtained.
