DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nLannett owns two facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from where all operations are based. The administrative offices, quality control laboratory, and manufacturing and production facilities are located in a 38,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road in Philadelphia. The second facility consists of 65,000 square feet, and is located within 1 mile of the State Road location, 9001 Torresdale Avenue in Philadelphia. Our research laboratory, package, warehousing and distribution operations, sales and accounting departments are located in the second building.\nIn December 2005, the Company refinanced the mortgages on these two properties. As of June 30, 2006, the mortgage balance was approximately $6 million.\nIn June 2006, Lannett signed a lease agreement on a 66,000 square foot facility located on seven acres in Philadelphia. An additional agreement which gives us the option to buy the facility was also signed. This new facility will hold the warehouse, and will become the future headquarters of the Company. We expect to\nbegin occupying the building in December 2006, with full conversion of the facility to take place over another 6 to 9 months. The existing facilities will continue to operate, giving the Company the ability to broaden its manufacturing and pharmaceutical development.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Lannett's facility expansion plans in 2006 involved which of the following combinations?\n\nA) Purchasing a new 66,000 sq ft facility and selling the 38,000 sq ft facility on State Road\nB) Leasing a new 66,000 sq ft facility with an option to buy, while retaining both existing facilities\nC) Refinancing mortgages on existing properties and purchasing a new 65,000 sq ft facility\nD) Leasing a new 38,000 sq ft facility and selling the 65,000 sq ft facility on Torresdale Avenue\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, in June 2006, Lannett signed a lease agreement for a new 66,000 square foot facility with an option to buy. The company planned to begin occupying this new building in December 2006. Importantly, the document states that \"The existing facilities will continue to operate, giving the Company the ability to broaden its manufacturing and pharmaceutical development.\" This indicates that Lannett was retaining both of its existing facilities (the 38,000 sq ft facility on State Road and the 65,000 sq ft facility on Torresdale Avenue) while adding the new leased facility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Lannett leased, not purchased, the new facility, and there's no mention of selling the State Road facility.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while Lannett did refinance mortgages on existing properties in December 2005, the new facility in 2006 was leased, not purchased.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the new facility was 66,000 sq ft, not 38,000 sq ft, and there's no mention of selling the Torresdale Avenue facility."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "776867_2000.txt", "docs_id": "776867", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2000", "text": "ITEM 2.

According to the documentation, Gymboree completed construction of a 300,000 square foot distribution center in Dixon, California in 1997, which began serving all U.S. stores in January 1998. The company leased a distribution center in Shannon, Ireland for European operations.

The documentation states that the property was acquired on March 15, 2011, through the Shea Exchange Agreement. It was then transferred to Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. (TMMG), a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company. Subsequently, it was transferred to Tonopah Resources, Inc. (TRI), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of TMMG. This creates a multi-level subsidiary structure where TRI, the current owner of the property, is a subsidiary of a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the property is not directly owned by the parent company. Option B is incorrect because the property is owned by TRI, not TMMG, and the milling facilities are described as dormant, not active.
