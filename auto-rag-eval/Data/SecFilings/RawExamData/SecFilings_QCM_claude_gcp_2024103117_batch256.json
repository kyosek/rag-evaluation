The documentation clearly states that the first loan is for $762,000 at 5.2% interest rate for 20 years, with monthly payments of principal and interest of $5,107.05, maturing in March 2033. This matches exactly with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mixes details from two different loans. The $925,000 amount is from the second loan, while the 5.2% interest rate and $5,107.05 monthly payment are from the first loan.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it correctly identifies the bridge loan amount of $200,000 and the interest rate (prime plus 2.75%), it incorrectly states the term as five years when it's actually three years.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although it correctly states the loan amount of $925,000 and the 6% interest rate for the second loan, it incorrectly states the amortization period as 25 years (it's actually 20 years) and the balloon payment as 15 years (it's actually 10 years)."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "1005387_1999.txt", "docs_id": "1005387", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

Irvine office: \n   - Final year monthly rent is stated as approximately $25,000\n\n2. Mountain View office:\n   - Total rent over 3 years: $408,000\n   - Monthly rent: $408,000 / (3 * 12) = $11,333\n\n3. Portland office:\n   - Total rent over 49 months: $321,000\n   - Monthly rent: $321,000 / 49 = $6,551 (rounded to nearest dollar)\n\n4. Sum of monthly rents:\n   $25,000 + $11,333 + $6,551 = $42,884\n\n5.
