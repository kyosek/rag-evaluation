Divide this by the square footage of the Houston office: $17.875 million / 283,000 sq ft = $63.16 per square foot\n\nHowever, this assumes the Houston office costs the same per square foot as their average location. Since it's their corporate headquarters in a major city, it's likely more expensive.

The building's net book value at December 31, 2003 was $240,000. In January 2004, it was sold with a gain of $23,000. To calculate the net financial impact, we need to consider both the book value and the gain:\n\nBook value: $240,000 (this is effectively the cost basis)\nGain on sale: $23,000\n\nThe sale price would have been the book value plus the gain: $240,000 + $23,000 = $263,000\n\nHowever, the net financial impact is the difference between the sale price and the book value:\n\n$263,000 (sale price) - $240,000 (book value) = $23,000\n\nBut since the building was on the books at $240,000 and was removed from the books through the sale, the net impact is:\n\n$23,000 (gain) - $240,000 (removal of asset from books) = -$217,000\n\nTherefore, the net financial impact is a loss of $217,000, making option A the correct answer.
