This is far less than its domestic leased office space, which includes large properties like the 404,000 sq ft headquarters in New Jersey.\n\nC) Correct. In England, the company leases 80,000 sq ft of office space. In Germany, it leases 49,000 sq ft and owns 58,000 sq ft, totaling 107,000 sq ft. The leased office space in England (80,000 sq ft) does indeed exceed the combined German office space (107,000 sq ft).\n\nD) Incorrect. The company's owned properties include 27,000 sq ft in Iowa, 70,000 sq ft in England, and 58,000 sq ft in Germany, totaling 155,000 sq ft.
