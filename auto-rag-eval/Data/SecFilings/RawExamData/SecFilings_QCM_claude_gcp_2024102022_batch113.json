PROPERTIES\nSeaMED leases three buildings in Redmond, Washington and one building in Bothell, Washington aggregating approximately 148,000 square feet, of which 60,000 square feet were occupied in fiscal year 1997. Three long-term leases cover approximately 140,000 square feet of space. Of the approximately 148,000 square feet currently occupied by SeaMED, approximately 110,000 square feet are used for manufacturing, approximately 31,000 square feet are used for engineering and approximately 7,000 square feet are used for administrative purposes.\nThe 60,000 square feet of production space added in fiscal year 1997 is in one new building. The lease term is 10 years with two five-year renewal options. Based on anticipated growth in the number and size of manufacturing cells, SeaMED is in the process of moving substantially all of the manufacturing of commercialized instruments to the space in the new building. The 81,000 square feet in the two other buildings occupied under long-term leases are expected to serve SeaMED's administrative and engineering needs, as well as provide manufacturing space for commercial products and instruments in the early stages of preproduction. SeaMED anticipates entering into a commitment in the near future to lease an additional 80,000 square feet of space in stages beginning in January 1999.\nITEM 3."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: SeaMED's total leased space is 148,000 square feet. If they follow through on their anticipated commitment to lease an additional 80,000 square feet, what percentage increase in total leased space will this represent, and how will it compare to their current manufacturing space?\n\nA) 54% increase, and it will be 27% less than their current manufacturing space\nB) 54% increase, and it will be 27% smaller than their current manufacturing space\nC) 54% increase, and it will be 27% larger than their current manufacturing space\nD) 54% increase, and it will be exactly equal to their current manufacturing space\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe current total leased space is 148,000 square feet. An additional 80,000 square feet would increase this to 228,000 square feet. This is an increase of (80,000 / 148,000) * 100 = 54%.\n\nThe current manufacturing space is stated as \"approximately 110,000 square feet\". The new 80,000 square feet is (80,000 / 110,000) * 100 = 72.7% of the current manufacturing space, or in other words, 27% larger than the current manufacturing space.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct as it accurately describes both the percentage increase in total space and how the new space compares to the current manufacturing space."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "783412_2009.htm", "docs_id": "783412", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.

Pie Five Unit:\n   - Size: 2,400 square feet\n   - Base rental rate in first five years: $40.00 per square foot\n   - Annual expense: 2,400 * $40.00 = $96,000\n\nTotal annual lease expense: $342,580 + $96,000 = $458,580\n\nOption A is incorrect as it doesn't account for the full corporate office expense.\nOption B only accounts for the corporate office expense.\nOption D is incorrect as it uses an incorrect calculation for the corporate office expense.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a complex text and perform multi-step calculations."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1018840_2003.txt", "docs_id": "1018840", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "ITEM 2.
