Together, they total 58,000 square feet (41,000 + 17,000 = 58,000). Therefore, a consolidated facility with equivalent total square footage would be approximately 58,000 square feet.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the consolidated facility would be larger than the Orlando facility (58,000 sq ft > 41,000 sq ft).\n\nOption C is incorrect because we don't have information about clean room space in the Jiading facility, so we can't determine if the consolidated facility would have less clean room space.\n\nOption D is incorrect because we don't have information about storage space in the Jiading facility, so we can't determine if the consolidated facility would have more storage space."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "1041179_1999.txt", "docs_id": "1041179", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.

While the office base rent expense has indeed decreased from $369.3 million in 2013 to $331.5 million in 2015, it's crucial to note that:\n\n1. The company leases \"substantially all\" its office space globally.\n2. Lease obligations of foreign operations are \"generally denominated in their local currency.\"\n3. The amounts from third-party subleases have remained relatively stable ($10.6M to $11.0M) and don't account for the significant decrease in expenses.\n4. There's no explicit mention of reducing office space or relocating to cheaper locations.\n\nGiven these factors, the most plausible explanation for the decreasing trend is that it might be influenced by currency fluctuations, as foreign lease obligations are denominated in local currencies.
