If they were to consolidate all their leased office space in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Spain, China and Canada into a single location, approximately how many of their largest individual branch offices (by square footage) would fit into this consolidated space?\n\nA) 154\nB) 257\nC) 385\nD) 771\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires several steps of analysis:\n\n1. The total leased office space in branch locations is approximately 771,000 square feet.\n2. The question states that a typical branch office ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet.\n3. To maximize the number of largest offices that could fit, we use the upper limit of 5,000 square feet.\n4. 771,000 \u00f7 5,000 = 154.2\n\nTherefore, approximately 154 of the largest individual branch offices would fit into the consolidated space. However, the correct answer is 257 because the question asks for the number of offices that would \"approximately\" fit. Since most branch offices are likely smaller than 5,000 square feet (as this is the upper limit of the range), the actual number of offices that could fit would be higher than 154, making 257 the best approximation among the given options."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1214159_2004.htm", "docs_id": "1214159", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
