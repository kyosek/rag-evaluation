The Antioch mill indeed has one paper machine that produces recycled linerboard and corrugating medium using 100% recycled fiber. The Bogalusa mill has five paper machines that can produce linerboard, corrugating medium, and unbleached kraft paper using softwood pulp, hardwood pulp, and recycled fiber.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mischaracterizes both mills' capabilities. The Bogalusa mill doesn't produce bleached kraft paper, and the Antioch mill doesn't use softwood pulp.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the Pine Bluff mill's capabilities. The documentation states that Pine Bluff has one paper machine, not multiple, and it doesn't mention corrugating medium as one of its products.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that all three mills have equal capabilities and can use any combination of fiber sources, which is not supported by the given information.
