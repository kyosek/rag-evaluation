Dividing this by 12 months gives an average monthly rent expense of $49,231 ($590,769 / 12 = $49,231). This amount differs from the actual monthly payments because the company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the entire lease period, including the free rent period.\n\nThis method demonstrates the matching principle in accounting. The matching principle states that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the related revenues.
