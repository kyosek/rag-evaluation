This property is the only one that is actually owned by the Company and not leased. It has a large land area (11 acres) with only a small existing structure (5,000 square foot office building), leaving ample room for new construction or expansion. Additionally, the documentation states that this property is \"held for sale,\" making it potentially available for purchase.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they refer to leased properties, which the company doesn't own and thus can't sell or expand freely.
