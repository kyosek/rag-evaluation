The documentation states that the facilities are suitable and adequate for their current intended purposes. It also mentions that while the facilities are highly utilized, they have the ability to expand as sales requirements justify. Specifically, it notes that \"expansion of the number of production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.\" This aligns perfectly with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document mentions that while most facilities are owned by the company, some are leased. Additionally, it states that the facilities have the ability to expand, contradicting the claim of operating at full capacity with no room for expansion.\n\nOption B is incorrect on two counts. First, the document states that the company owns most facilities, with some being leased, not all being leased. Second, it explicitly mentions that \"the exact extent of utilization is difficult to measure\" due to seasonal production cycles, contradicting the claim that utilization is easily measured.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the facilities are described as \"highly utilized,\" which contradicts the claim of being underutilized. The potential for expansion is through adjusting production schedules or hours, not through utilizing existing idle capacity."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "105608_2010.htm", "docs_id": "105608", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_8", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "Item 8.
