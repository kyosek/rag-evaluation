The documentation explicitly states that of the $12,266,000 in miscellaneous property, $9,618,000 is from properties acquired from borrowers, and $2,648,000 is from \"duplicate or excess bank-owned premises.\" This suggests that the company may be in the process of consolidating or streamlining its operations, as it has identified excess property that may no longer be necessary for its core business.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of new office space investments.

Upper Boones Ferry Road, Portland, Oregon, 97224 and consist of approximately 11,000 square feet of leased office, laboratory, warehouse, assembly, test and manufacturing space. On Oct 13, 2009 we signed a new lease for a smaller facility of approximately 7,000 square feet at 15875 SW 72nd Ave, Portland, OR 97224 with our existing landlord with an average cost of approximately $7,000 per month. The new lease is for a period of 30 months and substantially reduces our monthly operating costs while providing adequate research and development infrastructure for our future business. We anticipate moving to the new premises in the second quarter of 2010.\nOur joint venture, Beijing Marr, has land use rights in the Huairou district of Beijing, China to approximately 24,000 square meters that includes approximately 2,100 square meters of manufacturing facilities and other office and warehouse buildings.\nWe believe our properties are adequate for our current needs.\nItem 3."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is relocating its principal offices. Based on the information provided, what is the approximate percentage reduction in square footage and monthly cost for the new location compared to the previous one?\n\nA) 36% reduction in square footage, 30% reduction in monthly cost\nB) 36% reduction in square footage, 36% reduction in monthly cost\nC) 40% reduction in square footage, 36% reduction in monthly cost\nD) 40% reduction in square footage, 40% reduction in monthly cost\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe company is moving from an 11,000 square foot facility to a 7,000 square foot facility. This represents a reduction of 4,000 square feet or approximately 36% (4,000 / 11,000 = 0.3636 or 36.36%).\n\nThe new facility costs approximately $7,000 per month. While the exact cost of the previous facility isn't given, we can infer that it was around $10,000 per month based on the statement that the new lease \"substantially reduces our monthly operating costs.\" A reduction from $10,000 to $7,000 represents a 30% decrease in monthly cost.\n\nTherefore, option A is the closest match, with a 36% reduction in square footage and an approximate 30% reduction in monthly cost.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect as they either misstate the reduction in square footage or assume an incorrect reduction in monthly cost."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "906347_2001.htm", "docs_id": "906347", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2001", "text": "Item 2.

The correct percentage is actually 65.1%, not 69.5%. This is because the total leased space given in the document (0.8 million sq ft) doesn't match the sum of the individual regions (749,000 sq ft). Using the official total:\n\n   Percentage in North America: (521,000 / 800,000) * 100 = 65.125%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 65.1% of leased space in North America; 1.0 million square feet owned.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret data, perform calculations, and pay attention to discrepancies in the given information."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "805792_1996.txt", "docs_id": "805792", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1996", "text": "ITEM 2.PROPERTIES\nThe Company's facilities are divided among its three sectors and total approximately 766,000 square feet.\nIn North America, manufacturing and office space leased by the Company and its subsidiaries total approximately 329,000 square feet of which space approximately 8,400 square feet is sublet.
