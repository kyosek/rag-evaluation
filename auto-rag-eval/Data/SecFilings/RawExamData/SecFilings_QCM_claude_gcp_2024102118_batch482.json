The minimum base rent should be straightlined to account for any escalations over the lease term, including likely renewals.

We're told that in average stores, 25% of space is used for offices and storage.\n2. The average store size is 4,700 sq ft, but the new store is 6,000 sq ft.\n3. We need to calculate 25% of 6,000 sq ft to find the office and storage space.\n4. 25% of 6,000 = 0.25 * 6,000 = 1,500 sq ft\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information from a dense text, apply percentages, and perform calculations based on given and inferred data.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The document states \"The Company believes the current facilities are capable of servicing at least 1,200 stores.\" This gives us the maximum number of stores that can be serviced.\n\n2. Regarding the former facilities, the text mentions two leases:\n   - One covering 91,000 square feet, which will be terminated on July 31, 2003.\n   - Another covering 176,000 square feet, which expires in February 2008.\n\n3. The question asks for the total square footage still being leased \"as of the date of this report.\" Since the report is discussing future plans (the termination of the smaller lease), we can assume that at the time of writing, both leases are still active.\n\n4. The total square footage of the former facilities still being leased is therefore 91,000 + 176,000 = 267,000 square feet.\n\nThis question requires careful reading and the ability to combine information from different parts of the text, making it challenging for test-takers."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "1432967_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1432967", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTY.\nOur corporate offices are located in Clearwater, Florida.
