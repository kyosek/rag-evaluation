The passage states that Lamb Weston uses its farms \"as a source of raw materials, to better understand the costs of growing potatoes, and to deploy agronomic research.\" This indicates multiple purposes for the farms. Additionally, the document mentions that \"manufacturing assets are shared across all reporting segments\" and that they do not \"identify or allocate assets by operating segment.\" This supports the idea of a shared asset structure that includes the farms.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the farms are used for raw material production, this is not their exclusive use, and they are not managed separately from other assets.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the farms are described as being used for agricultural purposes, not primarily as office space or support facilities.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that they do not allocate assets by operating segment.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from different parts of the text and understand the multifaceted role of the company's agricultural properties within its overall asset management strategy."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "1388978_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1388978", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.\nProperties\nProperties\nDetails of the Company\u2019s properties are summarized as follows:\nItem\nAddress\nAreas\nLeased/Owned\nHeadquarters\n24/F., Unit 3 Great China International Square,\nNo 1 Fuhua Rd ,Futian District, Shenzhen,\nGuangdong Province, China\n262.75 sq. meters\nLeased\nManufacturing base\nNo. 9 Zhongduan, Fenghuang Mountain\nDevelopment Zone,\nAnyi County, Jiangxi Province, China\n25,638.77 sq. meters\nOwned\nThe Company\u2019s headquarters are leased from Mr. Chen Xing Hua, a director of the Company, for 1 year starting from May 4, 2009 to May 3, 2010.
