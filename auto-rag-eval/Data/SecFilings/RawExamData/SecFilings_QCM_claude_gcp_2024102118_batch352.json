The wells acquired from Gryphon Exploration Company were all deemed dry-holes and plugged and abandoned in 2004.

Estimated square footage:\n   Total stores: 124\n   Stores on balance sheet: 43 (owned) + 18 (leased) = 61\n   Proportion of stores on balance sheet: 61 / 124 = 0.4919\n   Estimated square footage = 0.4919 * 4.5 million = 2,213,550 sq ft\n\n3. Average net book value per square foot:\n   $143.8 million / 2,213,550 sq ft = $64.96 per sq ft\n\nThe closest answer is $31.73 per square foot, which is option A.\n\nThis question tests the ability to extract relevant information, make reasonable assumptions, and perform multi-step calculations based on financial data."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1002422_2010.htm", "docs_id": "1002422", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2010", "text": "ITEM 2.

Princeton, NJ office:\n   - Month-to-month lease at $119 per month\n   - Annual cost: $119 x 12 = $1,428\n\n2. Southfield, MI office:\n   - Three-month lease that automatically renews\n   - Requires two months' notice to terminate\n   - Rent is $715 per month, but the company shares the cost equally with another company\n   - The company's share: $715 / 2 = $357.50 per month\n\nTo terminate at the earliest opportunity:\n   - Current three-month term + two months' notice = 5 months minimum\n   - Cost for Southfield: $357.50 x 5 = $1,787.50\n\nTotal annual cost:\n   Princeton ($1,428) + Southfield ($1,787.50) = $3,215.50\n\nRounding up to the nearest dollar: $3,216\n\nThe closest option is C) $5,148, which accounts for a full year in Princeton and 5 months in Southfield: ($119 x 12) + ($357.50 x 5) = $1,428 + $3,720 = $5,148\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret complex lease terms, calculate costs accurately, and consider the earliest termination scenario."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "1174872_2009.htm", "docs_id": "1174872", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "ITEM 2.

It then mentions that the Bank leases full-service offices in Burlington (Cum-Park Plaza), Greensboro (Green Valley Road), and Mebane. Additionally, the Bank occupies space (implying leasing) for limited-service offices in Alamance Regional Medical Center and the Village of Brookwood Retirement Center, both in Burlington. This arrangement exactly matches the description in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Bank both owns and leases full-service offices.

The current monthly rent for the Sunrise location is approximately $73,000 with specified future increases.\nAll of Perfumania's retail stores are located in leased premises. Most of the store leases provide for the payment of a fixed amount of base rent plus a percentage of sales, ranging from 3% to 15%, over certain minimum sales levels.
