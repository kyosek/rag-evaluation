Which of the following statements most accurately describes HNB's branch distribution and market coverage?\n\nA) HNB has 14 branches total, with 11 on Oahu, 2 on Maui, and 1 on Hawaii (Big Island)\nB) HNB's branches on Maui cover the entire island, while its branch on Hawaii (Big Island) is limited to the Hilo area\nC) HNB has equal branch representation across Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii (Big Island), with specific coverage areas defined for each island\nD) HNB's principal market is Honolulu county, with limited presence on Maui and Hawaii (Big Island), serving specific corridors and areas on those islands\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is the most accurate description based on the given information. The documentation states that HNB's principal market areas are in Honolulu county on Oahu, where 11 of its branches are located. This indicates a strong focus on Oahu. The bank has a more limited presence on Maui (with branches in Kahului and Kihei) and Hawaii/Big Island (with one branch in Hilo). \n\nFor Maui, the bank serves the \"Wailuku, Kahului and Kihei corridor,\" showing a specific area of focus rather than island-wide coverage. On Hawaii, the Hilo branch serves a defined area \"from the ocean to Haihai to Komohana and Waianuenue,\" again indicating limited, specific coverage rather than island-wide service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only accounts for the branch numbers without considering the market focus.\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the coverage on Maui and doesn't accurately represent the limited service area on Hawaii.\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests equal representation across islands, which is not supported by the branch distribution described in the document."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1080319_2014.txt", "docs_id": "1080319", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "Item 2.
