Based on the given information, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's lease arrangements and property distribution?\n\nA) The company owns 251 stores across 35 states, with most leases having an initial term of at least 15 years.\n\nB) The company leases all of its store locations, with the majority of leases containing options to extend beyond the initial term.\n\nC) The company's distribution centers in San Diego and Ontario, California, combined provide approximately 390,000 square feet of space, with leases expiring in 2009 and 2012 respectively.\n\nD) The company operates stores in 33 states and Washington D.C., with all leases allowing for termination after 5 years if sales do not meet specified levels.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided states that the company leases approximately 125,000 square feet for its San Diego distribution center (expiring in 2009) and 265,000 square feet for its Ontario, California distribution center (expiring in 2012). These two figures add up to 390,000 square feet, and the expiration dates match those given in the statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leases all stores, not owns them, and operates in 34 states plus Puerto Rico, not 35 states. Most leases have an initial term of at least 10 years, not 15.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the company does lease all store locations, the information explicitly states that most leases do not contain options to extend the lease.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the company operates in 34 states and Puerto Rico, not 33 states and Washington D.C. Additionally, while leases do allow for termination if sales don't meet specified levels, this is after 3 years, not 5 years."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "871364_1998.txt", "docs_id": "871364", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "ITEM 2.

The document states that the company operated 32 rental branches, all of which were leased. Of these 32 leased properties, 21 were leased from related parties. This implies that the remaining 11 were leased from unaffiliated third parties. The annual aggregate rental payments to related parties was $3,378,768, and to unaffiliated third parties was $966,067. The sum of these two figures is $4,344,835, which represents the total annual rental payments for all 32 properties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company leased all properties, not owned them. Option B is incorrect because not all branches were leased from unaffiliated third parties, and the total rental amount is correct but misattributed. Option D is partially correct about the number of properties leased from unaffiliated parties, but it doesn't account for the leases from related parties and only mentions the rental payments to unaffiliated parties."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "1026738_1999.txt", "docs_id": "1026738", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "ITEM 2.
