The documentation explicitly states, \"Most of the leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to 15 years at rental rates generally adjusted on the basis of the consumer price index or other factors.\" This directly aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions fixed rental rates, which contradicts the information about rates being adjusted.\nOption B is close but incorrectly states that rates are adjusted based on market value, whereas the text specifies consumer price index or other factors.\nOption D is incorrect as it provides a different range for the renewal periods and doesn't mention the basis for rate adjustments.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and accurately interpret specific details from a complex text, making it suitable for a challenging exam."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "789457_1998.txt", "docs_id": "789457", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 2.
