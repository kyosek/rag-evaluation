Restaurant leases provide for a specified annual rent, and most leases call for additional or contingent rent based on sales volumes over specified levels. Generally, leases are \"net leases\" which require the Company's subsidiary to pay its pro rata share of taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. In some cases, the Company or another subsidiary guarantees the performance of new leases of the tenant subsidiary for a portion of the lease term, typically not exceeding the first five years.\nThe Company maintains its executive offices of approximately 9,800 square feet in New Hyde Park, New York.

Here's why:\n\n1. Lease length: The document states that lease expirations, including renewal options, range from 1 to 28 years. A 15-year lease with two 5-year renewal options (total 25 years) falls within this range.\n\n2. Renewal options: The majority of leases provide for renewal options ranging from five to ten years. The two 5-year renewal options in this scenario align with this practice.\n\n3. Rent structure: The document mentions that most leases call for additional or contingent rent based on sales volumes over specified levels, which is reflected in this option.\n\n4. \"Net lease\" structure: The scenario describes the subsidiary being responsible for its share of taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, which aligns with the \"net lease\" structure mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOptions A, C, and D each contain elements that are inconsistent with the typical practices described, such as excessively long lease terms without renewals, lack of contingent rent, or the landlord covering all property-related expenses."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "78814_2005.htm", "docs_id": "78814", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES\nOur World Headquarters and certain other facilities are located in Stamford, Connecticut.
