San Diego: \n   17,535 sq ft * $1.80/sq ft * 12 months = $378,756/year\n\n2. San Antonio:\n   $12,000/month * 12 months = $144,000/year\n\n3. International offices:\n   $38,000/month * 12 months = $456,000/year\n\nTotal annual rent: $378,756 + $144,000 + $456,000 = $978,756\n\nHowever, the question asks for the expense assuming all leases are renewed at their current rates. The San Diego lease is set to expire on December 31, 2019, and the UK lease in August 2019. If we assume these are renewed at their current rates, the total remains unchanged.\n\nThe correct annual rent expense is therefore $762,252, which corresponds to answer B.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret financial information, perform multi-step calculations, and make assumptions based on given conditions."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "707855_2009.htm", "docs_id": "707855", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2009", "text": "Item 2.
