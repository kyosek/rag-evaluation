This strongly suggests that the company changed auditors during the fiscal year. It's common for companies to change auditors, and when this happens, both the outgoing and incoming audit firms typically provide reports for the periods they respectively audited. This scenario is much more likely than the other options presented. Option A is an extreme conclusion without supporting evidence. Option C is not a standard requirement.

This makes sense for a large-scale mining operation, as reserves typically last for many decades.\n\nOptions A (25 years) and B (50 years) are too short for such large reserves, while D (200 years) is likely too long.
