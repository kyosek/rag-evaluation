The company owns 227 acres of property in the Cleveland area, with manufacturing facilities covering approximately 2,713,000 square feet. In addition to its Ohio operations, the company has manufacturing locations in other countries. Based on this information and assuming the company wants to expand its global manufacturing footprint while maintaining a strong presence in Cleveland, which of the following strategies would be most aligned with the company's current operational structure?\n\nA) Sell the Cleveland properties and relocate the headquarters to a foreign country with lower operating costs.\nB) Maintain the Cleveland headquarters but cease all U.S. manufacturing operations, focusing solely on foreign production.\nC) Keep the Cleveland facilities at current capacity and establish new manufacturing locations in 5 additional foreign countries.\nD) Double the manufacturing space in Cleveland and reduce the number of foreign manufacturing locations by half.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it aligns best with the company's current operational structure and growth strategy. The documentation indicates that the company has a strong presence in Cleveland with high utilization of existing facilities, and is \"adding capacity as necessary.\" It also mentions that the company operates manufacturing locations in 17 foreign countries. \n\nOption C suggests maintaining the current Cleveland operations while expanding into new foreign markets, which is consistent with the company's existing global presence and apparent growth strategy. This approach allows the company to keep its established base in Cleveland while continuing to diversify its global manufacturing footprint.\n\nOption A is incorrect because selling the Cleveland properties would be a drastic departure from the company's current structure, where Cleveland is described as the corporate headquarters and principal manufacturing location.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests ceasing all U.S. manufacturing, which goes against the information that the Cleveland facilities have high utilization and the company is adding capacity as needed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it maintains the Cleveland presence, it suggests reducing foreign operations, which is contrary to the company's apparent strategy of maintaining a significant global manufacturing presence."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "86521_2002.txt", "docs_id": "86521", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
