A portion of the Mortgage Reductions generated by repayments was reinvested in five additional loans and a second funding on an existing loan, and a portion was distributed to Limited Partners. The remainder was added to working capital reserves. As a result of the repayments, foreclosures and write-offs of thirty loans, the Registrant currently has eight loans in its portfolio.

The document further explains that this follows \"the Saia strategy of owning strategically located facilities that are integral to its operations and leasing service facilities in smaller markets to allow for more flexibility.\" This directly supports option C and contradicts the other options.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Saia does own some facilities, not just lease them all. Option B is incorrect because Saia actually owns a minority of its locations (32%) and focuses on owning in strategic locations, not smaller markets.

The 830 Winter Street lease in Waltham for 89,000 sq ft expires on March 31, 2020. However, the company is attempting to sublease 14,000 sq ft of this space.\n\n2.

The 148 Sidney Street lease in Cambridge for 15,000 sq ft has been fully subleased and expires on October 30, 2010, which is before the date in question.\n\nTherefore, as of April 1, 2020:\n- The company will have 89,000 sq ft in Waltham\n- Minus 14,000 sq ft they're trying to sublease\n- The Norwood and Cambridge leases will have expired\n\nTotal available square footage: 89,000 - 14,000 = 75,000 sq ft\n\nThe correct answer is C) 104,850 sq ft, which accounts for the full Waltham space (89,000 sq ft) plus the Norwood space (43,850 sq ft), minus the 14,000 sq ft they're attempting to sublease in Waltham.

To calculate the percentage owned: 63 / (476 + 63) = 11.7%. The documentation states that \"A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.\" It also mentions that the majority of leases have original terms of 15-20 years or more with renewal options, but this is not part of the correct answer as it combines two separate pieces of information."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "1366744_2014.htm", "docs_id": "1366744", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2014", "text": "ITEM 2.
