The Oldsmar lease extends through December 31, 2021. From December 1, 2019 (start of the new fiscal year) to December 31, 2021, there are 25 months.\n\n2. The Miami lease extends only through December 31, 2019, which is just one month into the new fiscal year starting December 1, 2019.\n\n3. The total rent charged to operations for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2019 was $322,984.\n\n4. To calculate the future minimum rental payments, we need to estimate the monthly rent:\n   $322,984 / 12 months \u2248 $26,915 per month\n\n5. For the Oldsmar lease: 25 months * $26,915 = $672,875\n   For the Miami lease: 1 month * ($38,000 / 12) \u2248 $3,167\n\n6. Total future minimum rental payments: $672,875 + $3,167 = $676,042\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is $361,984 (option C), which accounts for approximately 13.5 months of rent payments. While this is not exact, it's the best available option and could represent a simplified calculation or rounded figure for future minimum payments.\n\nOptions A and B are too low, likely representing only one year or slightly more of rent.
