The document states that \"our principal properties included operating solar cell manufacturing facilities with a combined total annual capacity of over 1.2 GW.\" It also provides details about two specific facilities:\n\n1. The facility in the Philippines has a total annual capacity of 400 MW.\n2. The facility in Malaysia has a total rated annual capacity of over 800 MW.\n\n1.2 GW is equivalent to 1200 MW. The Malaysia facility contributes over 800 MW, which is the larger portion of the total capacity. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Total capacity: 1.2 GW; Malaysia contributes the most.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 1.9 GW refers to the module assembly capacity, not the cell manufacturing capacity.\nOption C is incorrect because it overstates the total capacity and incorrectly identifies the larger contributor.\nOption D has the correct total capacity but incorrectly identifies the larger contributor."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "275119_2002.txt", "docs_id": "275119", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
