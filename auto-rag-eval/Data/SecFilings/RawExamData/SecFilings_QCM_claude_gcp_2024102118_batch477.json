The documentation states that the company issued 203,450 shares of common stock to the City in August 1996 as consideration for the $2,950,000 settlement amount. It also specifies that if the City hasn't received $2,950,000 from the sale of this stock by March 17, 1997, the company would pay the difference in cash. Additionally, the company incurred a charge against earnings of approximately $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 as a result of this settlement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't mention the stock issuance and implies a cash payment.\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't mention the guarantee to pay any shortfall in cash.\nOption D is incorrect because it misrepresents the payment method and doesn't mention the charge against earnings."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "850877_1998.txt", "docs_id": "850877", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 1.
