The total leased space is approximately 63,000 square feet, with an annual rent of $910,000 in fiscal year 1995. If the company decides to purchase a property similar to the one acquired in Raleigh, NC (10,000 sq ft) for each of its leased locations, and assuming the cost per square foot is uniform across all locations, approximately how much would the company need to spend on property acquisitions?\n\nA) $5.7 million\nB) $57 million\nC) $37.8 million\nD) $63 million\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of leased locations\n2. Determine the total square footage if each location were 10,000 sq ft\n3. Calculate the cost based on the given information\n\n1. The company leases space in 13 cities (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro, Indianapolis, Covington, Austin, Houston, Yardley, and New York City).\n\n2. If each location were 10,000 sq ft: 13 * 10,000 = 130,000 sq ft\n\n3. To calculate the cost, we can use the information about the Raleigh property:\n   The company paid $910,000 for 63,000 sq ft annually.\n   Cost per sq ft per year = $910,000 / 63,000 = $14.44/sq ft/year\n\n   Assuming this is roughly equivalent to the purchase price (which is a simplification), we can estimate:\n   130,000 sq ft * $14.44/sq ft * 20 years (assuming a 20-year value) = $37,544,000\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is C) $37.8 million."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "1297610_2004.txt", "docs_id": "1297610", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
