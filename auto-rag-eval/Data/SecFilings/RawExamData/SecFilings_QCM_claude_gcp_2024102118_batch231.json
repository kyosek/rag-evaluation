Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh)\n2. Florida (Miami)\n3. California (Oakland)\n\nThe document mentions that the Lisbon, Ohio office lease terminated in January 1997, so it was not active as of December 31, 1996.\n\nFor 1997, the document anticipates that Kent Consulting Group will lease additional office space in San Jose, California. This represents a new office location in a state where the company already has a presence (Oakland).\n\nWhile the document also mentions plans to add space in Pittsburgh and move the Miami office to Plantation, these changes do not add a new state to the company's locations.
