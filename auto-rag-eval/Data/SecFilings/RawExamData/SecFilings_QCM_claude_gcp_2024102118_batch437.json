The SEC filing states that out of approximately 9.5 million square feet of total warehousing and distribution space, about 9.1 million square feet is leased. This calculates to 95.8% of the total space being leased (9.1 / 9.5 = 0.958 or 95.8%).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the document clearly states that the majority of these facilities are leased, not owned.\n\nAnswer B is false because the filing indicates that out of 860 ground transport vehicles, 588 are leased and the rest are owned.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the corporate headquarters is only 6,000 square feet, which is much smaller than the average warehousing facility (9.5 million square feet / 434 facilities \u2248 21,889 square feet on average).\n\nAnswer D is the most accurate statement based on the given information."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "1442626_2017.htm", "docs_id": "1442626", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2017", "text": "Item 2.
