The assumed adjacent space lease was extended through October 15, 2009, after which the company vacated that additional space. Therefore, for the last full year of the original lease (March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011), the company would only be paying rent for the original space at $44,200.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total rent assuming both spaces were maintained.

Therefore, if both spaces were maintained, the total annual rent would be $44,200 + $22,860 = $67,060.\n\nOption A ($44,200) is incorrect as it only accounts for the original space.\nOption B ($63,045) is incorrect as this is the starting annual rent for the new lease that began after the period in question.\nOption D ($86,560) is incorrect as it's twice the original rent, not accounting for the different rate of the assumed space."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "1002519_2003.htm", "docs_id": "1002519", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2003", "text": "Item 2.

Properties. On March 23, 1981, the Company purchased a building at 125 Titus Avenue, Warrington, Pennsylvania for use as the Company's headquarters and as a manufacturing facility. The building, which is located on a three-acre site, originally contained approximately 29,000 square feet with approximately 8,000 square feet reserved for offices and engineering laboratories and 21,000 square feet for manufacturing facilities. During fiscal 1996, the Company completed construction of a 20,000 square foot addition to the Warrington facility to accommodate increased space requirements and to provide space for anticipated growth. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" under Item 7. On January 15, 1982, the Company leased 38,000 square feet of space on the second floor of a building on Richboynton Road in Dover, New Jersey, to be used for offices, engineering laboratories and manufacturing facilities. The lease term was for a period of ten years with a five-year renewal option. Effective March 1, 1992, the Company exercised the renewal option. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

What was the total square footage of the building after this expansion, and what percentage of the original space was dedicated to manufacturing?\n\nA) 49,000 sq ft total, with 72.4% of the original space for manufacturing\nB) 39,000 sq ft total, with 62.1% of the original space for manufacturing\nC) 49,000 sq ft total, with 62.1% of the original space for manufacturing\nD) 39,000 sq ft total, with 72.4% of the original space for manufacturing\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question requires multiple steps of calculation and careful reading of the provided information. The original building had 29,000 sq ft, and in 1996 a 20,000 sq ft addition was completed. This brings the total to 49,000 sq ft (29,000 + 20,000). Of the original 29,000 sq ft, 21,000 sq ft was for manufacturing facilities. To calculate the percentage: (21,000 / 29,000) * 100 = 72.4%. However, the question asks for the percentage of the original space, which is (21,000 / 29,000) * 100 = 72.4%. Therefore, the correct answer is C, with 49,000 sq ft total and 72.4% of the original space dedicated to manufacturing."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "826595_1998.txt", "docs_id": "826595", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1998", "text": "Item 1.
