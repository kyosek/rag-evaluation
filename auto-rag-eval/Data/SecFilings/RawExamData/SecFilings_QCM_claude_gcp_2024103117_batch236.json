Calculate the percentage\n\nFrom the documentation:\n- The company owns 12 properties used as branch locations\n- The company leases 11 properties, some of which are branch locations (excluding the principal office and mortgage production offices)\n\nThe tricky part is determining how many of the 11 leased properties are actually branch locations. We can deduce this by subtracting the known non-branch locations:\n11 total leased properties\n- 1 principal office\n- 1 operations facility (assumed from context)\n- 2 mortgage production offices (Raleigh and Wake Forest, assumed from context)\n= 7 leased branch locations\n\nTotal branch locations: 12 (owned) + 7 (leased) = 19\n\nPercentage owned: 12 / 19 = 0.6315789 or 63.16%\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.

According to the passage, if market rates for the fixed-rate debt were lower by 1%, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate debt would have increased from $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion. This inverse relationship between interest rates and bond values is a fundamental concept in finance. When interest rates decrease, the value of existing fixed-rate bonds increases because they become more attractive compared to new bonds issued at lower rates.
