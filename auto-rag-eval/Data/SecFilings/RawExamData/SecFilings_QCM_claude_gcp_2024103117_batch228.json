Fort Lauderdale office: $98,885\n2. Macau office: $15,484\nTotal: $114,369\n\nHowever, we also need to account for the rent abatement provision for the Ontario warehouse:\nAnnual abatement = $113,412 / 3 = $37,804 (as it's for 3 months)\n\nThis abatement would no longer be necessary if all operations were consolidated there, so it should be added to the potential savings:\n\n$114,369 + $37,804 = $152,173\n\nBut we must also consider that by May 1, 2016, the Macau office rent increased to $16,154 per year.
