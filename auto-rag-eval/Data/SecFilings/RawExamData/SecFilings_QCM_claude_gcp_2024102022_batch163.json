The total number of guestrooms is given as 7,690.\n2. The portfolio is split between two brands with a 3:1 ratio, meaning the larger brand represents 3/4 of the properties.\n3.

The total rented space is 4,244 square feet (732 + 3,512). Additionally, the document explicitly states that the company has no agreements to acquire any properties and does not believe it needs additional office space to carry out its current plans. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company rents, not owns, its current office spaces and has no plans to acquire more real estate.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the document specifically states that the company has no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate or related securities.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document clearly states there are currently no leases with FirstView EHR, Taptopia, Inc., or Metiscan, Inc.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from multiple parts of the document and draw accurate conclusions about the company's current real estate situation and future plans."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "205462_2002.txt", "docs_id": "205462", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "ITEM 2.
