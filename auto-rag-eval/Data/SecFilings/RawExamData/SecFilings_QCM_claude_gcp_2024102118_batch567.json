This adjustment arose from the years 2002 through 2006. The company did not adjust prior periods.

According to accounting standards (specifically ASC 250), when an error is discovered in previously issued financial statements, the materiality of the error should be evaluated with respect to both the current period and the prior periods. If the error is deemed immaterial to both the current period and the prior periods' financial statements, it is acceptable to correct the error in the current period without adjusting the prior periods. This is precisely what the company did in this case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because restatement is only required when the error is material to prior periods.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because recording the adjustment in the earliest period presented would only be appropriate if the error was material and required a restatement.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and incorrect.
