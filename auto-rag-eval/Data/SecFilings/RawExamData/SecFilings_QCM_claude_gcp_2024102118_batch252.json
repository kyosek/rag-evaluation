The statement that the company occupies the headquarters \"pursuant to our management agreement with ISP\" suggests a complex arrangement. This is further supported by the information that the headquarters is located on a campus owned by a subsidiary of International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP). The use of a management agreement, rather than a simple lease or ownership, implies a more intricate relationship between the company and ISP regarding the property. This arrangement likely involves some aspects of both property management and usage rights, without straightforward ownership or a standard lease.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document clearly states the property is owned by an ISP subsidiary, not the company itself. Option B is also incorrect, as a management agreement is different from a standard lease.
