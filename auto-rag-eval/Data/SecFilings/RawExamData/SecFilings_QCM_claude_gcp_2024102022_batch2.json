Calculate the total number of leased eye care centers: 128 + 3 (in negotiations/at will) = 131\n2. Calculate 50% of 131: 131 * 0.5 = 65.5, rounded up to 66 (as we need \"at least\" 50%)\n3. Sum the number of leases expiring by the end of 2002: 29 (2000) + 22 (2001) + 16 (2002) = 67\n4. Subtract the result in step 3 from the result in step 2: 66 - 67 = -1\n\nSince the number of leases expiring by 2002 (67) already exceeds the 50% threshold (66), no additional leases need to be renegotiated to meet the 50% goal. However, the question asks how many would need to be renegotiated to reach \"at least\" 50%, implying we should aim for the next whole number above 50%, which would be 51% or 67 leases.\n\nTo reach 67 leases, we need to renegotiate 11 more leases beyond the 56 already expiring by the end of 2002 (29 + 22 + 16 = 56).\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex data, perform multi-step calculations, and interpret results in the context of real-world business scenarios."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "850877_1999.txt", "docs_id": "850877", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_1", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "1999", "text": "Item 1.
