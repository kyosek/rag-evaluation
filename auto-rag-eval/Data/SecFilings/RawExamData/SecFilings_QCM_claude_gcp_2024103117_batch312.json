New York office:\n   - Monthly rent: $12,000\n   - Annual rent: $12,000 * 12 = $144,000\n\n2. Tampa facility:\n   - First year monthly rent: $10,443\n   - 3% annual increase\n   - Second year monthly rent: $10,443 * 1.03 = $10,756.29\n   - Annual rent for second year: $10,756.29 * 12 = $129,075.48\n\n3. Total annual rent for both facilities in the second year:\n   $144,000 + $129,075.48 = $273,075.48\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar gives us $273,116, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThis question tests the ability to carefully read and interpret lease terms, calculate percentage increases, and combine information from multiple sources within the document."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "357020_2002.htm", "docs_id": "357020", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2002", "text": "Item 2.

The company is in negotiations to purchase an additional 50 acres across the street specifically for developing a facility to manufacture blades for the wind energy market.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it misinterprets the expansion potential, suggesting the 316,650 square feet is land rather than potential building space.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the plant currently has four automated filament winders and one portable large diameter vertical winder, not five automated winders.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it confuses the acreage numbers, combining the 5 acres of adjacent land with the 50 acres across the street incorrectly."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "1001288_2006.htm", "docs_id": "1001288", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2006", "text": "Item 2.\nPROPERTIES\nLexmark\u2019s corporate headquarters and principal development facilities are located on a 374 acre campus in Lexington, Kentucky.

Based on the information provided, what can be inferred about the company's financial situation and lease compliance?\n\nA) The company was fully compliant with its lease terms but was evicted due to the landlord's financial difficulties.\n\nB) The company owed only one month's rent at the time of eviction, as evidenced by the $22,913 in unpaid rent.\n\nC) The company likely defaulted on its lease payments for several months, leading to eviction and outstanding rent owed.\n\nD) The company's rent expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, indicating they were paying more before eviction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Several pieces of information support this conclusion:\n\n1. The company was evicted in September 2010, less than two years into a three-year lease agreement.\n2. At the end of 2010, the company still owed $22,913 in unpaid rent to the former landlord.\n3. The annual rent ranged from $85,100 to $90,283, meaning the monthly rent was approximately $7,000-$7,500.\n4. The unpaid rent amount ($22,913) suggests multiple months of missed payments, not just one month.\n5. The rent expense for 2010 ($69,639) was significantly lower than 2009 ($99,115), indicating they likely stopped paying rent for part of 2010.\n\nOption A is incorrect as the eviction was due to the company's actions, not the landlord's. Option B is incorrect because the unpaid rent amount suggests more than one month of missed payments. Option D is incorrect as the rent expense actually decreased in 2010 compared to 2009."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "908259_2005.htm", "docs_id": "908259", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2005", "text": "ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nThe Company\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Waltham, Massachusetts where it leases a total of approximately 10,000 square feet of office space.

The company's existing approach to facilities management, as evidenced by the documentation, shows a preference for leasing separate office spaces with varying lease terms:\n\n1. They lease their corporate headquarters in Waltham, MA with a medium-term lease (5 years and 9 months).\n2.
