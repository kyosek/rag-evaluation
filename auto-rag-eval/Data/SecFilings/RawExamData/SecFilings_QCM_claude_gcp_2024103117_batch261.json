The New York City office has the highest rent per square foot: $75,000 for 3,500 sq ft, which is approximately $21.43 per sq ft. This is higher than other locations (e.g., Mahwah at $14.80 per sq ft).\n2. The document explicitly states: \"We are currently evaluating suitable space to house our headquarters and the activities based in our Mahwah and New York offices at the expiration of the respective leases.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the total annual rent is actually higher (about $517,000 for mentioned locations), and the Israeli lease extends beyond 5 years, expiring in 2010.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Mahwah office (5,000 sq ft) is not the largest; the Israeli office (18,000 sq ft) is larger. Also, they are actively seeking new space for Mahwah.\n\nOption C is partially correct about the Israeli lease being the most long-term, but it's incorrect about all US leases expiring by 2004.
