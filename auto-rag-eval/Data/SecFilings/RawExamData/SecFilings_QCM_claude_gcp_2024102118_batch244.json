Salt Lake City has more total square footage (30,500 sq ft) compared to Sunnyvale (20,500 sq ft, of which 6,000 sq ft are subleased).\n2.

The documentation clearly states that during 1998, the Partnership sold all of its remaining real property investments. It is currently in a post-sale phase, addressing matters such as monitoring the remediation of an environmental issue at a property in Lakewood, California that was sold in 1997. The Partnership is waiting for this environmental matter to be resolved before making a final liquidating distribution to Limited Partners.
