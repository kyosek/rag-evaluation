The document states that LNC and its Fort Wayne operating businesses own or lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space in the Fort Wayne area. The planned move to Philadelphia only mentions 30,000 square feet for the new headquarters, which is a small fraction of the space in Fort Wayne.

If they were to consolidate their operations into a single location, which of the following would be the most suitable option based on their current space usage and subletting practices?\n\nA) Lease a 15,300 sq ft office space\nB) Lease a 12,900 sq ft office space\nC) Lease a 10,700 sq ft office space\nD) Lease a 8,900 sq ft office space\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nTo determine the most suitable consolidated office space, we need to calculate the actual space used by the company across all locations:\n\n1. Montreal office: 5,800 sq ft - 2,400 sq ft (sublet) = 3,400 sq ft\n2. Mississauga office: 7,500 sq ft - 3,750 sq ft (half sublet) = 3,750 sq ft\n3. Atlanta office: 2,000 sq ft (no subletting mentioned)\n\nTotal space actually used: 3,400 + 3,750 + 2,000 = 9,150 sq ft\n\nThe closest option that would accommodate their current usage while allowing for some growth (as mentioned in the last paragraph) is 10,700 sq ft (option C). This provides about 17% additional space for projected growth over the next 12 months.\n\nOption A is too large and would result in significant unused space. Option B is also larger than necessary given their current usage and subletting practices. Option D, while close to their current usage, doesn't provide enough additional space for the projected growth mentioned in the document."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "46619_2004.txt", "docs_id": "46619", "title": "N/A", "section": "section_2", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "2004", "text": "ITEM 2.
