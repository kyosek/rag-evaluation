I want an inertia sensor that can detect sudden change in speed, as in case of an accident, and have a lower sensitivity so that it doesn't trigger on potholes, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Strange you didn't find them since there are *way* more MEMS accelerometers than gyroscopes around.\n\nReally, it's the same technology only tuned for linear acceleration instead of angular ones. Usually 1 axis (only in one direction) or 3 axes. Often you find 6 axes units (accelerometer \\+ gyro) and even 9 axes ones (typical for phones: accelerometer \\+ gyro \\+ flux gates, gives the magnetic north)\n\nAs for sensitivity you'll want a *lower* sensitivity since a pothole gives a lot less Gs than a front collision :D Anyway, it's only a measurement range issue: you can buy 1G sensor for small vibration and, say, 16G sensor for detecting drops to ground. No idea of how many Gs is a car accident.\n\nThe output these days is often some kind of digital interface like I2C or SPI; there are however some analog output ones around if you prefer that.\n\nDeciding if it's a collision or a pothole is a filtering issue usually delegated to software."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A car manufacturer wants to implement a collision detection system using MEMS sensors. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the selection and implementation of such a sensor?\n\nA) The system should use a MEMS gyroscope with high sensitivity to detect sudden changes in vehicle orientation during a collision.\n\nB) A MEMS accelerometer with a measurement range of 1G would be ideal for detecting the high forces involved in a vehicle collision.\n\nC) The system should use a MEMS accelerometer with a relatively high G-force range, and software filtering to distinguish between collisions and minor disturbances.\n\nD) A 9-axis MEMS sensor (accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer) is necessary to accurately detect vehicle collisions in all possible scenarios.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. A MEMS accelerometer is more suitable than a gyroscope for detecting sudden changes in speed, which is characteristic of a collision. The sensor should have a relatively high G-force range (e.g., 16G) to capture the significant forces involved in a collision without saturating. Software filtering is crucial to distinguish between actual collisions and minor disturbances like potholes. While options A and B mention relevant sensors, they don't accurately describe the optimal setup.

While different, they are all Polish spaces, and therefore Borel isomorphic.\n\nFor example, we can ask what is the smallest size family of functions $\\\\cal F\\\\subseteq\\\\omega^\\\\omega$ such that for every $g\\\\in\\\\omega^\\\\omega$ there is some $f\\\\in\\\\cal F$ such that $g\\\\leq f$ everywhere, or at least $g\\\\leq^f$, namely there is some $m$, such that for all $n\\>m$, $g(n)\\\\leq f(n)$.\n\nOne can show that this cardinal, also known as *the dominating number* and usually denoted by $\\\\frak d$, is uncountable, and of course bounded by $2^{\\\\aleph\\_0}$. We can prove, for example, that its cofinality is uncountable. And it is consistently taking many different values.\n\nSome are more topological or measure\\-theoretic in nature, e.g. what is the smallest cardinality of a non\\-meager set, or how many null sets are needed to cover the whole space.\n\nThere are many more CCCs, some more famous (e.g. $\\\\frak p$ and $\\\\frak t$ which made headlines over the last summer), and some are less famous (e.g. $\\\\frak h$ the shattering number).\n\n> Where can I find a brief history of the research into CCCs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a historical note to \u00a73 (\u201cSix cardinals\u201d) in chapter 3 (\u201cThe Integers and Topology\u201d, by Erik K. van Douwen) in the 1984 *Handbook of Set\\-Theoretical Topology* edited by Kunen and Vaughan. For the sake of MathOverflow's completeness, here is an excerpt of it:\n\n> $\\\\mathfrak{b}$, $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\\\mathfrak{t}$ are due to Rothberger \\[1939, 1948], $\\\\mathfrak{d}$ to Kat\u011btov \\[1960A], $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ to Hechler \\[1972b] and Solomon, and $\\\\mathfrak{s}$ to Booth. (For simplicity we give someone credit for a cardinal $\\\\mathfrak{k}$ even if he or she only considers the possibility that $\\\\mathfrak{k}$ is or is not equal to $\\\\omega\\_1$ or $\\\\mathfrak{c}$. Also, \u201cis due to\u201d abbreviates some laborious phrase with \u201cthe earliest reference we are aware of\u201d.) \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> There have been many notations for these cardinals. For example, $\\\\mathfrak{b}$ is called $\\\\aleph\\_\\\\eta$ by Rothberger \\[1939], $K\\_8$ by Hechler \\[1972], $\\\\lambda\\_3$ by Solomon and $\\\\xi$ by Burke and van\u00a0Douwen. Moreover, Rothberger \\[1939, 1941] uses $B(\\\\kappa)$ for \u201cevery $F\\\\subseteq\\[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega$ with $\\|F\\|\\=\\\\kappa$ is bounded\u201d, i.e., for $\\\\kappa^\\+\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{b}$ ($B$ for \u2018born\u00e9e\u2019), Tall \\[2000] uses $P(\\\\kappa)$ for $\\\\kappa\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{p}$ ($P$ because Rudin's proof that $\\\\beta\\\\omega\\-\\\\omega$ has a $P$\\-point under $\\\\mathfrak{c}\\=\\\\omega\\_1$ works if $P(\\\\mathfrak{c})$), and van\u00a0Douwen \\[1976A] uses $\\\\mathrm{BF}(\\\\kappa)$ for $\\\\kappa\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{b}$ ($\\\\mathrm{BF}$ for \u2018bounded functions\u2019).\n> \n> \n> We here introduce yet another notation which we hope will be definitive. Our letters were chosen to be mnemonic (of course $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ was inpsired by $P(\\\\kappa)$, and \u2018pseudo\\-intersection\u2019 was created to make $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ look mnemonic), and they are lower case German (whenever available) because $\\\\mathfrak{c}$ is lower case German. (Note that $\\\\mathfrak{c}$ is mnemonic: the cardinality of the continuum.) Jerry Vaughan \\[1979] has independently come up with this lower case German convention, and, with one exception, even chose the same letters: we now agree about the letters for the eight cardinals mentioned.\n> \n> \n> In Theorem\u00a03\\.1, $\\\\omega\\_1\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{p}$ is due to Hausdorff \\[p.244], $\\\\mathfrak{t}\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{p}$ and (b)\u00a0and\u00a0(c) to Rothberger \\[1948\u2026], $\\\\mathfrak{b}\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{a}$ to Solomon\u00a0\\[\u2026].\n\nThe 1939 reference to Fritz Rothberger is a bit confusing because the quoted chapter lists two 1939 references, labelad 1939A and 1939B, to papers by Rothberger, the former of which was actually published in 1938:\n\n* [\u201cUne remarque concernant l'hypoth\u00e8se du continu\u201d](http://pldml.icm.edu.pl/pldml/element/bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-article-fmv31i1p22bwm), *Fund.

The former paper considers bounding family but only the latter defines (under the name $\\\\aleph\\_\\\\eta$) what would be called\u00a0$\\\\mathfrak{b}$.

It's extremely time\\-consuming to evenly paint a house exterior, and sprayers are much faster.\n\nFor your fix, replace the mesh the same way it was originally installed (you can check from inside the crawlspace, you'll have to get in there anyway to staple your new mesh) and then paint over it if you want it to match, or just the stucco frame around the new mesh."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When repairing a damaged stucco vent with a hole, what is the most appropriate course of action according to the expert advice given?\n\nA) Apply wire mesh over the hole and paint it to match the surrounding area\nB) Fill the hole with stucco to create a seamless appearance\nC) Replace the entire vent assembly, including the mesh and framing\nD) Staple new wire mesh directly onto the existing damaged vent\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert advises that the best fix for damaged stucco vents is to replace them entirely.

Is it only slightly more than the number of parameters (12\\)? Assuming you have at least, say, 24 counts:\n\nWhen you model data with a poisson distribution, you are saying that the variance of that data is equal to its mean. In other words, if you predict a count of 10000, then the variance of that count is 10000 (std.dev 100\\).\n\nIn real life, that isn't always true. Some data have more variance than this, and some less. It looks like your data has less (if we predict a count of 10000, then the variance appears to be more like 1371 rather than 10000\\).\n\nYour (non\\-quasi\\-)poisson model ignores that fact. It is taking the predictive variance to always be equal to the predictive mean even when the data indicates otherwise. This is why it thinks the parameters are insignificant, because it is highly overstating the predictive variance.\n\nIf you only have 13\\-15 rows of data then it might just be that the poisson glm happens to fit very well and the residuals were smaller than expected.\n\nIf the counts are reasonably large, the Gaussian distribution is a good approximation. If some counts are quite small (say, less than 25\\) then it works less well. Bear in mind also that if you use a Gaussian LM, the effects are additive (observing in November \\= \\+1000 birds against June, for example) rather than multiplicative (observing in November \\= x2 birds against June)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing count data of bird sightings across different months and regions.

Which of the following modeling approaches would be most appropriate for this scenario?\n\nA) Standard Poisson regression\nB) Negative binomial regression\nC) Quasipoisson regression\nD) Ordinary least squares regression\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Standard Poisson regression assumes the variance equals the mean, which is not true for underdispersed data.\nB) Negative binomial regression is used for overdispersed data, not underdispersed.\nC) Quasipoisson regression can account for underdispersion by estimating a dispersion parameter, making it suitable for this scenario.\nD) Ordinary least squares regression (Gaussian) may not be ideal for count data, especially if some counts are small.\n\nThe quasipoisson model is most appropriate as it can handle underdispersion, unlike standard Poisson or negative binomial models. It allows for more accurate parameter estimates and significance testing when the variance is less than the mean, as observed in this bird count data."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/22", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/71906", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/26264/"], "docs_id": 71906, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Possibility of determining the mass of the water by knowing water volume, water temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nI want to know if I can determine the mass of $V\\=0\\.01\\\\,m^3$ of water in $T\\=298\\\\,k$ and $P\\=1\\\\,atm$.\n\nSo what formula should I use?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The density of water is, nominally, 1g/ml, but varies depending on several factors\n\n* Impurities (dissolved ions, salts, other solutes will change the density)\n\nSalts and ions are typically higher mass atoms/molecules than the 18atm H$\\_2$O molecule, as such any dissolved ions increase the mass of the liquid in the same volume and therefore increase the density, Ocean Salt water can be 3\\-5% more dense than freshwater at the same temperature, for instance. Salt water also depresses the freezing point and this affects the temperature dependence of the density. \n\n* Temperature\n\nWater density varies greatly with temperature, fresh water near boiling can be as low as 950 g/l (.95g/ml or 950kg/m$^3$) increasing as temperature decreases to a maximum at 4$^\\\\circ$C (1g/ml) before decreasing slightly to freezing. For water room temperature and below the variation is less than $.5$% . This is by far the largest contribution to variation in density for fresh water at normal earth conditions. \n\n* External Pressure\n\nLiquids are relatively poorly compressible, so at atmospheric levels the atmospheric pressure will contribute negligibly to the density of water, however freezing temperatures get depressed with changes in atmospheric pressure and can affect the density vs temperature. At higher pressures the effects are more pronounced\n\nFor all of these conditions, there are really no equations to determine the density, and those that exist are typically quantitatively based on experimental measurement and apply to a certain set of conditions. THe answer is that you have to look it up based on your conditions. (Most tables for density vs temperature online are given for fresh water at 1 ATM) \n\nDepending on the accuracy you desire you can analyze all these properties without measuring its mass to determine the density with greater precision. However for most daily uses, an estimate of 1g/ml is close enough"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A scientist needs to determine the mass of water in a container with high precision.

It also doesn't consider other factors affecting density.\nD) This is the most accurate approach.

I need to export one of my notes and upload it to a web site with file size restrictions (unfortunately I don't know the maximum size, but I have reason to believe it is 2 MB).\n\nA 12\\-page\\-long note, consisting only of written text/mathematics and a single grayscale imported figure in one of the pages is taking up 10\\+ MB, which is frankly outrageous. Also, I'm pretty sure taking out the figure would make little difference; seems like the developers never paid attention to exported file sizes.\n\nHow can I reduce this to fit into my 2 MB budget?\n\nIdeally I'd like to flip a switch inside Notability itself which reduced the export file size, but I don't think anything like that exists.\n\nOtherwise, I'm looking for free tools which would help me reduce the file size. **EDIT**: online tools are not a possibility, as I can't run the risk of my file being stored and later distributed somehow.\n\nI've already tried exporting a PDF from Preview.app with the \"Reduce File Size\" filter, which didn't make a difference.\n\nGhostscript fared a little better: `gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf` reduced the file size to 7 MB, but it's not enough for me.\n\nImageMagick's `convert` tool produced output that could be barely classified as readable, even at an alleged 600 DPI.\n\nI also tried exporting JPEGs from Notability and concatenating them with Preview.app, which produced a 4 MB file size, still unsuitable for me (and also, I lose vector rendering, searching, etc. that way, which if possible I'd like to retain).\n\nMy best result until now was running this 4 MB file through `gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf` (note `ebook` instead of `printer`). It is readable, although visibly compressed, and takes up 1\\.3 MB. Lacking any other options, this is the file I'm going to submit, but I'm hopeful there's a better solution.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming your top priority is to minimize file size. You are going to have to sacrifice and switch over to an image format. Notability uses a vast amount of vectors in order to keep your handing writing sharp and readable at any size, so we will need to discard that information in favor of a simpler , less sharp jpeg file. \n\n**If you have photoshop**, export all the files from Notability into an image format and bring them into your desktop to work on. Opening all the images inside Photoshop, use the \u201c[save for web](https://www.lifewire.com/photoshop-save-for-web-tool-tutorial-1697537)\u201d feature and select the absolute minimum of colors possible. I suggest 2 colors for the page (background \\& lines), and and 3\\-5 colors for pens (black, red, blue, green, is okay with [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) ).\n\nThis will allow you to create an image with minimal compression, at a sharper resolution. \n\n**If you have GIMP** (free and open source \\<3\\): You can add an extension that gives you similar functionality to that of Photoshop\u2019s \u201csave for web\u201d function. Here is a guide to how to install and use its different options on [TemplateToaster.com](https://templatetoaster.com/tutorials/gimp-save-for-web/).\n\nThese are both options for bringing 1920x1080 images down to about \\~\\<80 KB each with readable text and minimal compression.\n\nEdit:\n-----\n\nI thought I would include an example that I create with my own notes, exported to Jpeg directly from Goodnotes 5 (this works regardless of program). **All images are at the native resoultion of 1668x2154**\n\nBelow are the results you can expect to see. \n[![Image hsowing the difference in files sizes between compressed images and non compressed](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F36fI.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F36fI.png)\nOn the right, are the original, straight from Goodnotes exported jpegs. On the left, are the images compressed down with the \"save for web\" plugin on **[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)**.\n\nBelow are the options that I used for most of the pages, with the exception of pages with images, where instead the \"use web\\-optimized pallete\" option was selected. Note how there are only 5 colors.(page, page line, 2 pen colors, white text)\n[![image showing options used for exporting png's from Gimp](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cv4YS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cv4YS.png)\n\nUsing this option will retain all text sharpness from the original exported text. Below is difference in quality, on the left is the compressed image, and the right uncompressed. \n\n[![Image showing the difference in quality in text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NQcsy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NQcsy.png)\n\nThis should answer your question. As previously stated, you cannot expect to maintain the .pdf format and submit your work under such a tight data budget. The size of all the files combined together in the first image is in relative to a normal folder with all the images inside. When .zipped, you can expect an even larger file reduction (depending of course on the level of compression that you select with something like 7zip).

Exporting as images and using GIMP's \"Save for Web\" extension with a limited color palette (5 colors including background, lines, and pen colors) can significantly reduce file size while keeping text sharp and readable. This method produced images of about 80KB each in the example given, which would fit within the 2MB limit for 12 pages. Options A and B did not reduce the file size sufficiently in the original post.

It implies a stronger sense that only one option can be chosen. \n\nOn the other hand, \"rather than\" is more nuanced.

If the text is light, the shadow is dark. So, with a light background, the shadow ensures some legibility at least if the actual text is also light.\n\n---\n\nIn what follows, I'm using a plain background similar to the ones in the question with Greybird as the theme on Xubuntu 18\\.04\\.1\\.\n\nThis image has text with shadows:\n\n[![text with shadows](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrfFA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrfFA.png)\n\nIn the next image, shadows are removed:\n\n[![text without shadows](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZhqJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZhqJ.png)\n\nTo remove the shadows, one has to edit Greybird's *gtkrc* file. I first copied the entire Greybird folder from */usr/share/themes* over to *\\~/.themes* which I created in my home folder. To distinguish the copied local version from the system one, I renamed the local version *MyGreybird*.\n\nIn *\\~/.themes/MyGreybird/gtk\\-2\\.0/gtkrc*, the code determining the appearance of text on the desktop is in the section titled \n*style \"xfcedesktop\\-icon\\-view\"* (\\~ line 927\\). To remove shadows, I commented out all lines relating to shadows. (These lines are not commented out in the original *gtkrc*.)\n\n```\nstyle \"xfdesktop-icon-view\"\n{\n    XfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 0\n    XfdesktopIconView::selected-label-alpha = 80\n#   XfdesktopIconView::shadow-x-offset = 0\n#   XfdesktopIconView::shadow-y-offset = 1\n#   XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-x-offset = 0\n#   XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-y-offset = 1\n#   XfdesktopIconView::shadow-color = shade(1.5, @tooltip_bg_color)\n#   XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-color = shade(1.8, @tooltip_bg_color)\n#   XfdesktopIconView::shadow-blur-radius = 2\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-spacing = 2\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-padding = 6\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-text-width-proportion = 1.9\n\n    fg[NORMAL] = shade (0.9, @selected_fg_color)\n    fg[ACTIVE] = @selected_fg_color\n\n```\n\nRemoving shadows is fine provided one has a simple darkish background. With lighter backgrounds or wallpapers, text legibility maybe reduced. *File System* and *Home* are virtually invisible in the image below.\n\n[![text with shadows on a light background](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MfqtX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MfqtX.png)\n\n---\n\nOne could also play with\n\n```\nXfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 0\nXfdesktopIconView::selected-label-alpha = 80\n\n```\n\nto increase or decrease the transparency of the region surrounding text such as surrounding *Trash* in the last image.\n\n---\n\nNote that even though Greybird is a compiled theme, that only affects the gtk3 aspect.

This method allows for personalization without affecting the system-wide theme.\n\nOption A is incorrect because directly editing system-wide themes is not recommended and may be overwritten during updates.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increasing the label-alpha value would make the text background more opaque, not remove shadows.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Xubuntu 18.04 still uses a GTK2-based desktop, and switching to a GTK3 desktop would be a much more drastic change than necessary to solve this issue.\n\nIt's important to note that removing shadows may reduce text legibility on lighter backgrounds, so users should consider their desktop background when making this change."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/01", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/219984", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/98709/"], "docs_id": 219984, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: ![Hearthstone Fireball Card](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppFln.png)\n\nI mean, if damage is countable, it should be\n\n> Deal 6 damages.\n\nIf it\u2019s not countable, then this sentence should be wrong.\n\nSuch as saying something like\n\n> I drank 5 water.\n\nSo... am I missing something here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's domain specific, and not something that would be said outside the context of a game like this.\n\nIt's almost certainly an elided form of the following:\n\n> Deal 6 ***points of*** damage.\n\n(And *damage* here is a mass noun.)\n\nIn the same way that headlines take liberties with the omission of articles and other grammatical structures, so too is this game using a shortened form of English that's understood in its own context.

That's why hibernating is better if this would be a problem.\n\nAs for the effect on your battery, it depends entirely on the type of chemical composition used in the battery. eg Lithium\\-Ion and Nickel MEtal Hydride have different charging, usage and lifetime recommendations.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential consequences of this practice?\n\nA) Sleep mode has no negative effects on laptops and is always preferable to shutting down.\nB) Sleep mode can lead to data loss if there's a complete power failure, but has no impact on battery life.\nC) Sleep mode's impact on the laptop depends on factors such as power source and battery type, with potential risks including data loss during power failure and varying effects on battery lifespan.\nD) Sleep mode always degrades battery life faster than regular shutdown, regardless of the battery's chemical composition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the nuanced information provided in the documentation. Sleep mode can indeed lead to data loss if there's a complete power failure, as the RAM cannot be refreshed without power. Additionally, the impact on battery life varies depending on the chemical composition of the battery (e.g., Lithium-Ion vs. Nickel Metal Hydride), which have different charging, usage, and lifetime recommendations. \n\nOption A is incorrect because sleep mode can have potential negative effects. \nOption B is partially correct about data loss but incorrectly states there's no impact on battery life. \nOption D is too absolute in its statement about battery degradation, not accounting for differences in battery types."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/06", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/302236", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/181165/"], "docs_id": 302236, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Whenever I play ACNL, I find my villagers are sick, but if they get too sick, can they die?

I imagine that intuitively the load is no longer applied in a fully normal manner (orthogonal) onto the bridge, but I cannot convince myself. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fracture happens under tension \\- that is, when you pull on something hard enough, it rips. The key to understanding the arc design hinges on understanding that it lowers the maximum tensile force.\n\nTake a simple beam, support it at the ends, and hang something off the center:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ag8V.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ag8V.png)\n\nTension at the bottom, and compression at the top, are needed to balance the torque created by the vertical forces of the supports, and the load in the middle. Obviously, the further apart the supports are, or the greater the load, the greater the tension. When that tension reaches a critical value the beam will fail.\n\nNow if we shape the bridge into an arc, we get this:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtqNa.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtqNa.png)\n\nThe additional lateral forces on the arc cause compression in the beam, this reduces the net tension at the bottom and makes the beam better able to support the load. You can make things even better by spreading the load more evenly, designing the shape of the arc to better optimize the load distribution, etc \\- but the diagram should give you a sense of the underlying principle.\n\nUpdate\n------\n\nThe lateral forces are perhaps most easily understood by looking at a V shaped structure: you know intuitively that such a structure would collapse unless you provide some torque at the apex to keep the legs together, or provide sufficient friction at the base of the legs to keep them together. You can also see that the force needed near the hinge (which is provided by the red \"tension\" stress in my upper diagram) would need to be much greater than the force provided by friction at the bottom (lateral forces from the support on the arch).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OAEy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OAEy.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A civil engineer is designing a bridge and needs to choose between a flat beam design and an arched design.

The key advantage of an arched bridge design over a flat beam design is that it introduces compressive forces that help counteract the tensile forces at the bottom of the structure. This allows the bridge to support greater loads.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the arched design does distribute the load differently, it doesn't eliminate all tensile forces.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the arched design does create additional lateral forces, these forces don't simply increase load capacity without affecting tensile forces. Instead, they create compressive forces that counteract tension.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the arched design doesn't eliminate compressive forces.

The following text is an excerpt from the [QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/1.8/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/supported_data.html#improving-performance-shape) (the bold style is added by me for the sake of clearness):\n\n> To improve the performance of drawing a shapefile, you can create a\n>  spatial index. **A spatial index will improve the speed of both\n>  zooming and panning**.

It needs to be created explicitly in code and does not persist. On the other hand, a spatial index for a vector layer (often resulting in a .qix file for shapefiles) is typically stored on disk and primarily improves the speed of rendering (zooming and panning) the layer. This spatial index can be created through the layer properties dialog or programmatically using the createSpatialIndex() method of the layer's data provider. The spatial index option when creating a memory layer refers to this type of index, not the QgsSpatialIndex()."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/15", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/312852", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/203556/"], "docs_id": 312852, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I might be wrong for some things here, but here is what I recently though about.\n\nModern frameworks MVC such as ASP.NET MVC 5, CakePHP, Java Spring etc. has their logic clearly separated into Models View and Controller.

According to the documentation, horizontal mounting on the roof offers two advantages:\n1. It helps the antenna elements (wings) unfold more easily during installation, as they don't have to fight against gravity.\n2.

This solution is simple, effective, and maintains the integrity of the original applications."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/11", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/7860", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/137/"], "docs_id": 7860, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm filtering a product collection by the custom attribute `ean` with the following code\n\n```\n$collection = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection();\n$collection->addAttributeToSelect('name');\n$collection->addAttributeToSelect('ean');\n$collection->addFieldToFilter('ean', '678678');\n\nforeach ($collection as $product)\n{\n     Mage::Log('product found');\n}\n\n```\n\nThere is product with this ean but no product is found.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The methods `addFieldToFilter()` and `addAttributeToFilter()` are the same.\n\n```\n/app/code/core/Mage/Eav/Model/Entity/Collection/Abstract.php:339\n/**\n * Wrapper for compatibility with Varien_Data_Collection_Db\n *\n * @param mixed $attribute\n * @param mixed $condition\n */\npublic function addFieldToFilter($attribute, $condition = null)\n{\n    return $this->addAttributeToFilter($attribute, $condition);\n}\n\n```\n\nI would try to remove the filter, then loop over the collection and check the values of ean.

This approach follows the principle that circuit protection should be based on the smallest wire gauge in the circuit. Since 14 AWG wire has been introduced to the circuit, the maximum allowable breaker size is 15 amps. Changing the receptacle ensures all components are rated appropriately for the new circuit protection.

I have washer/dryer closet and the dryer sits atop my washer (in classic fashion). However, when the washer goes into a fast spin, the dryer shakes on top a bit and makes some noise. I realized if I could just get some small (say around 3\" or 4\") compression rods on either side of the dryer (between it and the closet wall), it would really help to stabilize the movement and the sound.\n\nThe closest I could find through web searching is 6\"curtain rods, which are just too long and too weak. Ideally, I'm looking for something like what I'm showing in the illustration below. Big suction cup like ends would be great but as long as it's a fairly wide, flat surface, it could be anything (plastic, rubber, etc.). Any ideas where I could find something like this or how I could build it?\n\n[![compression rod illustration](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBLZk.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBLZk.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would suggest that you get yourself some high density foam material similar to the type used for padding furniture cushions. You can get this material in various thicknesses so you would want to measure the gap from the sides of the dryer and the walls and purchase accordingly. [One Example](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01H2QS5RE)\n\nThe idea is to cut the high density padding into a square of say 1\\.5 or 2\\.0 feet on a side. Then squeeze that in between the wall and the dryer sides. You will want the material to be under some compression when it is installed. It may be necessary to insert two pads of different thicknesses on top of each other to get the needed space filled up with some compression. \n\nThis approach has some decided advantages as follows:\n\n1. The foam material will act to muffle the sound coupled to the wall. Your idea with point contact will more likely couple sound right into the wall.\n2. The foam pad extends out over a larger area of the dryer sides to provide stability and to reduce the drum head effect that metal appliance walls can create.\n3. The pad spreads the compression load over a large surface of the wall to prevent wall damage. A point type of compression assembly would have to be positioned over a stud to ensure that it does not eventually break into the wall. This would be particularly an issue for the very common drywall material made of paper and plaster material. With the foam that load gets spread across a large area."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner wants to stabilize their stacked washer and dryer to reduce noise and movement during the spin cycle.
