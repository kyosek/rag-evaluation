I have looked through other articles and couldn't get help. Any help?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Add the grub arguments `noapic noacpi nosplash` in place of `quiet splash`. `noapic` and `noacpi` are kernel boot options. ACPI stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface and APIC stands for Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller.\n\nImmediately after the motherboard / computer manufacturer logo splash screen appears when the computer is booting, with BIOS, quickly press and hold the `Shift` key, which will bring up a GNU GRUB menu screen. With UEFI press (perhaps several times) the `Esc` key to get to the GNU GRUB menu screen. Sometimes the manufacturer's splash screen is a part of the Windows bootloader, so when you power up the machine it goes straight to the GNU GRUB menu screen, and then pressing `Shift` is unnecessary.\n\nYou will see a GNU GRUB menu screen that looks like this:\n\n[![GNU GRUB menu screen](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCPLl.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCPLl.png)\n\nPress `e` to enter editing mode. This will bring up a GNU GRUB screen that looks like this:\n\n[![GNU GRUB screen](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoYht.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoYht.png)\n\nUse the arrow keys to navigate when screen editing the above screen. Navigate to after the string on this screen that starts with `root=`. In this example screen the full string is `root=` followed by `UUID=` and a hexadecimal string as shown below:\n\n```\nroot=UUID=bcf15ef2-a0b2-4753-9558-8399dd12a729   \n\n```\n\nImmediately after this string replace `quiet splash` by `noapic noacpi nosplash`. This change is only temporary \u2014 it will just be used once and GRUB won't remember it in the future. It may be possible to make these changes permanent by changing the ACPI and APIC settings in the Mac Mini's UEFI firmware. Press `Ctrl`\\+`X` or `F10` to boot with the kernel boot options that were added. If you make a mistake, press `Esc` to go back to the previous screen."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are trying to troubleshoot a booting issue on a Mac Mini Mid 2011. Which of the following sets of kernel boot options would you add to the GRUB menu to potentially resolve ACPI and APIC-related problems?\n\nA) quiet splash\nB) noapic noacpi nosplash\nC) apic acpi splash\nD) nogrub noefi noboot\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) noapic noacpi nosplash. These kernel boot options are specifically mentioned in the documentation as potential solutions for hardware-related issues, especially on older Mac models. \n\n\"noapic\" disables the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller, \"noacpi\" disables the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, and \"nosplash\" prevents the splash screen from displaying during boot. These options can help bypass potential conflicts with the Mac's hardware that might be preventing successful boot.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it represents the default options that are typically replaced when troubleshooting.\nOption C is incorrect as it uses \"apic\" and \"acpi\" which would enable these features rather than disable them.\nOption D is incorrect as these are not valid kernel boot options and would likely cause more boot problems rather than solve them.\n\nTo apply these options, one would need to access the GRUB menu by pressing Shift (for BIOS) or Esc (for UEFI) during boot, then edit the boot entry by replacing \"quiet splash\" with \"noapic noacpi nosplash\"."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/24", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/358375", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1383400/"], "docs_id": 358375, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question: [https://stackoverflow.com/review/low\\-quality\\-posts/17716516](https://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/17716516)\ndisplays a code block and asks\n\n> Code blows on MailApp line with message \"invalid email: Range\".

As a matter of fact I was able to build a demo project on my own using this. There is one point though \\- use of **Xib** is proposed. It is not exclusively mentioned that **Storyboards** can't be used, but going through these lines towards the end of article, makes me think otherwise : \n\n> With great power comes great responsibility (and limitations).

This UIViewController must be set as the\n>  initial UIViewController for this storyboard.\n\nIt isa mentioned that in case of **Storyboards**, we should create an extension and use that in `UIViewController` : \n\n```\nextension MyViewController: StoryboardInstantiable {\n}  \n\n```\n\n**StoryboardInstantiable :** \n\n```\nimport UIKit\n\nprotocol StoryboardInstantiable: NSObjectProtocol {\n  associatedtype MyType  // 1\n  static var defaultFileName: String { get }  // 2\n  static func instantiateViewController(_ bundle: Bundle?) -> MyType // 3\n}\n\nextension StoryboardInstantiable where Self: UIViewController {\n  static var defaultFileName: String {\n    return NSStringFromClass(Self.self).components(separatedBy: \".\").last!\n  }\n\n  static func instantiateViewController(_ bundle: Bundle? = nil) -> Self {\n    let fileName = defaultFileName\n    let sb = UIStoryboard(name: fileName, bundle: bundle)\n    return sb.instantiateInitialViewController() as! Self\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Queries :** \n\n1. As the author mentioned that separate **Storyboard** would have to be created for each `UIViewController`, how is using Xib a better way in *Coordinator pattern* ?\n2. Why do we need to create a separate **Storyboard** for each `UIViewController` ? Can't we use `UIViewController`'s storyboard identifier for that by not linking any `UIViewController` using segues ? That way can adjust the above extension using identifier and easily achieve the same.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have read that tutorial many times and it uses a Coordinator for each View controller which doesn't make sense to me. I thought that the purpose of a Coordinator was to move the logic of navigation away from the view controllers and into a higher level object that can manage the overall flow. \n\nIf you would like to initialise ViewControllers from the main storyboard, use this protocol and extension instead:\n\n```\nimport UIKit\n\nprotocol Storyboarded {\n    static func instantiate() -> Self\n}\n\nextension Storyboarded where Self: UIViewController {\n    static func instantiate() -> Self {\n        // this pulls out \"MyApp.MyViewController\"\n        let fullName = NSStringFromClass(self)\n\n        // this splits by the dot and uses everything after, giving \"MyViewController\"\n        let className = fullName.components(separatedBy: \".\")[1]\n\n        // load our storyboard\n        let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: Bundle.main)\n\n        // instantiate a view controller with that identifier, and force cast as the type that was requested\n        return storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: className) as! Self\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThe only requirement is that each View controller used by it has this protocol and has a StoryboardID with the same name as the class. \n\nYou can use it this way:\n\n```\nprivate func startBlueFlow() {\n    let vc = BlueViewControllerOne.instantiate()\n    vc.coordinator = self\n    self.navigationController.push(vc, animated: true)\n}\n\n```\n\n**Disclaimer:** Protocol taken from [this article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps) which may also help you\n\n**UPDATE:** (added reference)\n\n[Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/) is commonly credited and referenced in other articles and tutorials regarding the coordinator pattern in iOS and Redux.

While the original tutorial suggested creating separate Storyboards for each UIViewController, this approach is not necessary and can be overly complex. The Coordinator pattern can be effectively implemented using a single main Storyboard, as demonstrated in the updated approach provided in the top answer. \n\nThis method uses a `Storyboarded` protocol and extension that allows ViewControllers to be instantiated from the main Storyboard using their Storyboard IDs. This approach maintains the benefits of the Coordinator pattern (separating navigation logic from ViewControllers) while still leveraging the advantages of using Storyboards for UI design.\n\nOption A is incorrect because separate Storyboards for each ViewController are not required. Option B is misleading; while XIBs can be used, they're not inherently better for the Coordinator pattern.

Jolenealaska indicates that this was still common in the late 70s. \n\nThis in fact represented literary practice in the 19th century, and a primary object of schoolteachers has always been to encourage use of prestige forms\u2014what used to be called \u2018proper English\u2019\u2014and to stamp out non\\-standard forms.\n\nSince the middle of the 19th century, however, *may* has been giving way to *can* in permissions, and it is my impression that schoolteachers have pretty much given up that particular fight. Nonetheless, the 'rule' still prevails in formal, written English\u2020; and there are lots of people out there (many in very senior positions) who I adhere to the rule.\n\nI consequently recommend that you observe this distinction in any formal writing you undertake if you have any hope of becoming a Recognized Authority (at which point, of course, you may write anything you please). Failure to do so may result in bad marks while you are still a student, and afterwards may annoy any superiors of my age or Jolenealaska's\u2014at least until we are all retired or dead.\n\n---\n\n\u2020 The written dialect is always quite conservative, for a couple of reasons: \n\n* Very few people grow up in households where the written dialect is spoken, so it is essentially a foreign language which can only be mastered through reading. Consequently, during the years you are learning the dialect you are working entirely with texts older than you are yourself, or written by authors who are older; and by the time you master the language, and start publishing your own texts you are yourself older than many or most of your readers.\n* It is not only a much richer language lexically, it is a much more complex one syntactically, because it must express more complex ideas with more precision and writers have no opportunity to interrupt their discourses to explain what readers have not understood.

This reflects the conservative nature of written language and the persistence of certain linguistic \"rules\" in formal writing, even as spoken language evolves.

The most reliable solution in this case is to use the dd command to write the ISO directly to the entire device (option C). This method bypasses potential issues with partition formatting and bootloader installation that can occur with graphical tools.\n\nOption A is unlikely to solve the issue, as changing USB ports doesn't address the underlying problem.

When I delete the unwanted spaces, I get the first image, which shows that your notes have the normal stems, and the beam starts nicely (accidentally) at the top of the first note's stem, but then slope 2 is not enough for covering the others.\nThe right code to connect the notes is:\n\n```\n\\ibu1f2\\qb1f\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\qb1g\\zcn{-7}{la}\\qb1h\\zcn{-7}{si}\\tbu1\\qb1i\n\n```\n\n[![image 1, disconnected stems](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyGtz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyGtz.png)\n[![image 2, connected stems](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRr5m.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRr5m.png)\n\nThe second image shows that the last stem is a little bit shorter than the first.\nOther problems in your examples are:\nYour text is placed arbitrarily due to the spaces inserted. As you can see in my images, the syllable always starts on the left of the note. If you want it centered, you could use \\\\ccn (paragraph 17\\.3 of the musixdoc manual), but it does not align nicely, much more effective (if you do not want to invoke musixlyr) is `\\zsong{*text*}` or `\\csong{*text*}`, without the need of indicating a hight (see paragraph 23\\.1\\). The advantage is that musixtex then uses the notes as measure for the horizontal distances. Text is always tricky in music, at least when you do not tell musixtex how long your text is. I used the various forms in the first measure of the third example.\n[![image 3, text placing](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPvHJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPvHJ.png)\n\nAnother problem is your use of the slurs. The first starts too early. If you want to have it started at the stem of the note, use `\\ibsluru0e` and end it before the third (or the second, in case you wanted 1 distance length instead of your manually adjusted 2 lengths) note with `\\tslur0c` (the c is the correction to avoid closing at stem hight, see paragraph 10\\.2 of the manual).\nWith this code:\n\n```\n    \\documentclass{article}\n% packages\n\\usepackage{background}\n\\usepackage{musixtex}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\thispagestyle{empty}\n\\begin{document}\n\\section{Fee Ra Huri / Omnia}\n\\begin{music}\n\\instrumentnumber{1}            % number of instruments\n\\setstaffs1{1}              % number of lines per instrument\n\\generalmeter{\\allabreve}   % time stamp. meterC is 4/4, allabreve is 2/2 or cut time.\n\\generalsignature{2}            % sets the key. a number greater than 0 is sharp, smaller than 0 is flat\n\\startextract\n% bar 1\n\\Notes\\csong{mi}\\ibsluru0e\\cu e\\cchar{-7}{si}\\qlp i\\tslur0c\\ccn{-7}{si}\\cl i\\ccn{-7}{si}\\cl i\\ccn{-7}{la}\\slur hgd{1}\\qu h\\cchar{-7}{sol}\\qu g\\en % sol\n\\bar % bar 2\n  \\Notes\\zcn{-7}{la}\\qu h\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\uptext{\\it tr}\\qu g\\zcn{-7}{mi}\\qu e\\en % mi\n\\bar % bar 3\n  \\Notes\\zcn{-7}{re}\\qu d\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\qu g\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\qu g\\en % sol\n\\bar % bar 4\n  \\Notes\\zcn{-7}{fa}\\qu f\\zcn{-7}{mi}\\qu e\\zcn{-7}{fa}\\ibu1f2\\qb1f\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\qb1g\\zcn{-7}{la}\\qb1h\\zcn{-7}{si}\\tbu1\\qb1i\\zcn{-7}{la}\\qu h\\zcn{-7}{mi}\\qu e\\en % mi    \n\\endextract\n\\end{music}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nI get the last example.\n[![image 4, slurs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekpDx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekpDx.png)\n\nConclusion: musixtex offers a lot of commands to type music nicely, but never use spaces for horizontal alignment, and, please, study the manual well!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the MusixTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using MusixTeX to create beamed notes, which of the following statements is correct regarding the proper method to connect notes to a beam?\n\nA) Use \\ibu1f2 before each note in the beam group, and \\tbu1 after the last note.\n\nB) Place \\qb1 before each note letter in the beam group, with \\ibu1f2 at the start and \\tbu1 at the end.\n\nC) Use \\zcn{-7} before each note in the beam group to ensure proper connection.\n\nD) Simply place the notes close together in the code without any special commands.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct method to connect notes to a beam in MusixTeX is to use \\qb1 before each note letter in the beam group, with \\ibu1f2 at the start of the group and \\tbu1 at the end.

I read that DS1102E has 1 GSa/s sampling rate and DS1102CA has 2 GSa/s. OK. But what does it give in practice?

While both oscilloscopes have the same bandwidth (100MHz), which determines the highest frequency they can measure without significant attenuation, the sampling rate affects the resolution and detail of the captured waveform.

Controlled Access**\n\nFollowing is bit complicated, however it provides it's orders list controlled access. \n\n```csharp\npublic User \n{\n    private IList<Order> _orders;\n\n    public User()\n    {\n        _orders = new List<Order>();\n    }\n\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return new new ReadOnlyCollection<Order>(_orders);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Add(Order order)\n    {  \n        order.User = this;\n        _orders.Add(order);\n    }\n\n    public void Remove(Order order)\n    {\n        if (_orders.Contains(order)\n        { \n            order.User = null;\n            _orders.Remove(order);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe second approach clearly has it's benefits, but it also increase the number of lines in the code (imagine when few of the collections are in the entity). So the question is, is it worth the trouble?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Important question: in the first example, where does the code that enforces the business invariant live?\n\nThe first approach looks simple and straight forward because all the hard stuff has been moved somewhere else!\n\nSo, in order:\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is bad, because the constraint on the list of users has been moved outside the entity.\n\n```\nuser.getOrders().add(invariantViolatingOrder);\n\n```\n\nYour second approach is better, but still has problems\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return new new ReadOnlyCollection<Order>(_orders);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis protects the collection against change, but it doesn't protect the Order's from being changed in a way that violates the invariant.\n\n```\nuser.getOrders().getOrder(2).invariantViolatingChange();\n\n```\n\nThe order entity can enforce an invariant of its own state, but it can't enforce an invariant of the combined state. (Contrived example: this particular user is only allowed $20 dollars of orders. You have to check the entire collection to verify that it's ok to change this one order).\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that an invariant is enforced at every point that changes the state of an entity, is to make sure there is only one place where the state can be changed, and enforce it there. In OO terms, this is \"encapsulation\".\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            // By returning a copy of the state, we ensure that nothing\n            // outside the user can change its state.\n            IList<Order> readOnly = new List<Order>();\n\n            for (Order o : _orders) {\n                // Turtles all the way down: this depends on the order\n                // providing copies of its own state.\n                readOnly.add(o.clone());\n            }\n\n            return readOnly ;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnother possibility is to treat the internal state of an entity as an immutable value type. Getting *immutable* state is perfectly fine, because there's no way that the immutable state can be used to violate the business invariant.\n\nBut again, this second solution is turtles all the way down; you have to be careful about including entities in a value object."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In domain-driven design, which approach best maintains encapsulation and enforces business invariants for a User entity with a collection of Order entities?\n\nA) Using public getter and setter for the Orders collection:\n```csharp\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nB) Using a private collection with a public getter returning a ReadOnlyCollection:\n```csharp\npublic User \n{\n    private IList<Order> _orders;\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get { return new ReadOnlyCollection<Order>(_orders); }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nC) Using a private collection with a public getter returning a deep copy:\n```csharp\npublic User \n{\n    private IList<Order> _orders;\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get \n        {\n            IList<Order> readOnly = new List<Order>();\n            foreach (Order o in _orders) \n            {\n                readOnly.Add(o.Clone());\n            }\n            return readOnly;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nD) Using public Add and Remove methods without a getter for the Orders collection:\n```csharp\npublic User \n{\n    private IList<Order> _orders;\n    public void AddOrder(Order order) { /* implementation */ }\n    public void RemoveOrder(Order order) { /* implementation */ }\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C provides the best encapsulation and enforcement of business invariants.

I know how to do that, but I don't the math required to answer this question.\n\nSo I understand \"Whether a .... polynomial in a single variable has integer ...?\"\n\nMy question:\n\n* What does diophantine mean\n* What is an integer root\n* How do you determine if a diophantine polynomial in a single variable has integer roots?\n\nThe math behind this question is assumed to be known, once I know the answers to those three questions (really just the last one) I can answer my homework.\n\nNote: it may or may not be obvious that this is computable, since I don't know enough about the math to say, I will say a lot of things that seem computable are not unless their input and output are acceptable to a finite precision.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are various definitions of Diophantine equation, not all equivalent. But one standard definition goes as follows. Let $P(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ be a polynomial with *integer* coefficients. A *solution* of the Diophantine equation $P(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)\\=0$ is a $k$\\-tuple $(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ of *integers* that satisfies the equation. An equation is Diophantine partly because of its shape, but much more because of the *kinds* of solutions we are looking for.\n\nGeneral Diophantine equations can be exceedingly difficult. However, in principle one variable equation are simple. We have a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients. Let \n$$P(x)\\=a\\_0x^n\\+a\\_1x^{n\\-1}\\+a\\_2x^{n\\-2}\\+\\\\cdots \\+a\\_n.$$\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that the constant term $a\\_n$ is not equal to $0$. It is straightforward to show that any integer solution of the equation $P(x)\\=0$ must divide the constant term $a\\_n$.\n\nSo there is a simple (in principle!) algorithm for finding all the integer solutions of $P(x)\\=0$: \n\n(i) Find all the divisors (positive and negative) of the constant term and then \n\n(ii) Find out, by substitution, which ones of these divisors \"work.\"\n\nAs you know, factorization of large numbers can be computationally difficult. However, there certainly is an algorithm for factoring.\n\n**Remark:** There is a very famous related problem, called *Hilbert's 10th Problem*. Hilbert asked for a general algorithm that would, for any polynomial $P$ with integer coefficients, and possibly many variables, determine whether the equation $P\\=0$ has integer solutions. After earlier progress by a number of people, Matijasevich showed that there is *no* general algorithm of the type that Hilbert asked for. But as we noted in our answer to your question, there certainly *is* an algorithm that works for polynomials in one variable.\n\nDiophantus himself in his *Arithmetica* looked mainly for *rational* solutions. Often, a problem is called Diophantine if we are interested in solutions that are somehow fairly closely related to the integers. \n\nNote that (at least to people in Logic) the famous Fermat equation $x^n\\+y^n\\=z^n$ is not a Diophantine equation, since the exponents are also variable. Such equations are sometimes called *exponential Diophantine*, or, more casually, Diophantine. \n\n**A simple example:** Consider the equation $3x^4\\-12x^3\\-x^2\\+4x\\=0$. We want to find all integer solutions of this equation. First rewrite our equation as \n$x(3x^3\\-12x^2\\-x\\+4\\)\\=0$. This has the obvious solution $x\\=0$. Any other solutions must be solutions of the equation \n$$3x^3\\-12x^2\\-x\\+4\\=0\\.$$\nBy the result mentioned in the main post, any integer solution of this equation must divide the constant term $4$. The divisors of $4$ are $\\\\pm 1$, $\\\\pm 2$, and $\\\\pm 4$. Substitute these values in turn for $x$. We find that $x\\=4$ is a root, but none of the others are. So we have found all the integer solutions of our original equation: they are $x\\=0$ and $x\\=4$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding Diophantine polynomials and their integer roots?\n\nA) All Diophantine polynomials in multiple variables have a general algorithm to determine if they have integer solutions.\n\nB) For a Diophantine polynomial P(x) = a\u2080x\u207f + a\u2081x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + ... + a\u2099 in a single variable, any integer solution must be a factor of a\u2080.\n\nC) Hilbert's 10th Problem, which asks for a general algorithm to determine if any Diophantine equation has integer solutions, has been proven to have a solution.\n\nD) To find all integer roots of a single-variable Diophantine polynomial, one must check all factors of the constant term and verify which ones satisfy the equation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is incorrect because Hilbert's 10th Problem proved that no such general algorithm exists for multiple variables.

(The winding number is how many times a curve goes around a marked point; the turning number is how many times its *velocity vector* goes around the origin.) The turning number equals the integral of the curvature divided by $2\\\\pi$. Second, as others noticed, $r$ should not be too large if the curvature attains negative values.

Let $t\\\\mapsto s(t)$ be an arc\\-length parametrization of the original curve and $V(t),N(t)$ its Frenet frame.

If, for example want to select by expression to just select towns where the average wage is over a certain level, I can't even begin because I can't write an expression using values from both layers, even though I set them up in a relation. \nHow would I really go about doing this? \n\nI am trying to figure out how to query, select, or anything using attributes from two related layers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd suggest a two step process:\n\n1. If your businesses do not have the town codes associated with them, then you need to do a spatial join. In QGIS this is under Vector \\- Data Management Tools \\- Join Attributes by Location. The target layer will be your businesses and the join layer will be the towns (I'm assuming the towns are a polygon layer). Every business (assuming these are points) will be assigned the attributes of the town where it is located. Once this is done, you'll be able to query the new business layer using the attributes of the towns \\- and create summary tables (next step).\n2. If you want to join summarized data from the businesses back to the towns (so you can map by town or do town\\-based queries) you'll need to download a QGIS plugin that will allow you to sum by attributes to create new tables. Under Plugins \\- Manage and Install Plugins, take a look at Group Stats or Statist. You can use one of these to summarize the businesses by the town attributes you assigned in step 1, to create average wages for the town (for example). Once you have business data summarized by town, then you can do a regular one to one attribute table join, to join your summary table back to the towns layer to map the summarized data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have two layers in QGIS: a town borders layer with town codes, and a business layer with wage data.

First, a spatial join assigns town attributes to businesses. Then, a plugin like Group Stats is used to summarize business data (including average wages) by town. This summary is joined back to the town layer, allowing for selection based on the averaged wage data. Options A and C rely on relates/relations which don't allow for the required calculations.

I saw Winter was coming, and so I stopped spending catnip. That allowed me to have enough catnip to survive, even without farming.\n\nBut as you noted, you now have farmers. Once you get past four kittens, just living off of the stockpile of 5,000 isn't really enough. Most kittens should become farmers during winter, so that the rest of your population doesn't die off. \n\nAnother option is to build a barn or two, and make your stockpile even larger. The more barns you have, the more kittens you can support through a winter without farmers.

See this [question](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/140403/53818).\n\nBut the standard API uses both approaches.\n\nSeparate factory:\n\n```\nDatatypeFactory.newInstance().newXMLGregorianCalendar(...)\n\n```\n\nStatic methods in same class:\n\n```\nCalendar.getInstance(...)\n\n```\n\nWhy is this? In what case would having static methods be better than having a separate factory?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Factory is probably one of the most misused patterns. People always talk about how it allows to easily switch to a different factory that generates different classes, but usually fail to notice that you can't do that with factory alone \\- you need some sort of dependency injection too!\n\nThe overhead seems small \\- use `CalendarFactory.newInstance().newCalendar()` instead of `Calendar.getInstance()`. But we wanted factory in the first place so we could easily switch factories and change the way objects are constructed. Can we really do that here? `CalendarFactory.newInstance()` is always the same function so it'll always return a factory object constructed the same way, which will create `Calendar`s in the same way. In order to change the `Calendar` creation process, we need to either change `CalendarFactory.newInstace` or `CalendarFactory.newCalendar`. How is that any better from having to change `Calendar.getInstance`?\n\nIf we want to be able to easily change the `Calendar` creation process, we had to use dependency injection \\- create a `CalendarFactory` object somewhere and pass it around. That way we can control which factory the methods we call and objects we construct use.\n\nThere is a drawback to this approach though \\- having to pass that factory object around introduces quite a burden on the programmer. Methods need an extra arguments \\- for **the entire call\\-chain** from where the factory is created to where it's used. Objects need an extra field that you need to supply even if you don't use any method that requires that factory(alternatively \\- you have to remember if you supplied it or not, and exception will be thrown if the factory field is not set. But this exposes the implementation as it forces the user to know which methods require setting the factory field).\n\nSince the overhead here is much bigger than the naive, worthless use of the factory, we can't just blindly apply the pattern(OK, I take that back \\- you can *always* blindly apply design patterns, and too many programmers do) and we actually need to think. Do we really need to be able to switch the `Calendar` creation process all over the place? Do we need it enough to introduce such burden on the programmers?\n\nIn the case of Java's `Calendar`, the answer was \"no\". Being able to tell what the time is differently, or to represent it differently in the memory, is not useful enough to have to pass around a `CalendarFactory` object all over the place."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the Factory pattern and dependency injection in the context of creating Calendar objects?\n\nA) The Factory pattern alone is sufficient to allow easy switching between different Calendar implementations without any drawbacks.\n\nB) Using a separate CalendarFactory class with a static newInstance() method provides more flexibility than Calendar.getInstance() for switching implementations.\n\nC) Dependency injection is necessary in addition to the Factory pattern to truly enable flexible switching of Calendar implementations, but this comes with increased complexity in code.\n\nD) Static factory methods like Calendar.getInstance() are always preferable to separate factory classes due to their simplicity and ease of use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that while the Factory pattern is often used with the intention of allowing easy switching between different implementations, it alone is not sufficient. Dependency injection is necessary to truly enable this flexibility. However, this approach introduces additional complexity, as it requires passing factory objects throughout the call chain and potentially modifying object fields.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Factory pattern alone does not provide the full flexibility often attributed to it.\n\nOption B is misleading. A separate CalendarFactory with a static newInstance() method doesn't inherently provide more flexibility than Calendar.getInstance(), as both are static methods that would need to be modified to change the implementation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while static factory methods like Calendar.getInstance() can be simpler, they are not always preferable. The choice depends on the specific needs of the application, particularly whether the flexibility to switch implementations is worth the added complexity of dependency injection."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/06", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/331118", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/178144/"], "docs_id": 331118, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What would one call the large **horizontal** structural fixture (on which the five faces are embedded)?\n\nThe image is from the Chicago Civic Opera Building, built in 1928\\.\n\n> This throne\\-shaped 49\\-story skyscraper is home to the internationally\n> renowned Lyric Opera of Chicago.

For example, negation (i.e. *x \\= \\-x*) can be performed simply by flipping all the bits in the number and adding one. Performing the same operation in raw binary (e.g. with a sign bit) usually involves a lot more work, because you must treat certain bits in the stream as special. Same goes for addition \\- the add operation for negative numbers is identical to the add operation for positive numbers, so no additional logic (no pun intended) is required to handle the negative case.\n\nWhile this doesn't mean it's easier from your perspective, as a consumer of this data, it does lessen the design effort and complexity of the device, thus presumably making it cheaper."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An embedded systems engineer is designing a digital signal processing circuit that frequently performs arithmetic operations on signed integers.

While intuitive for humans, it complicates arithmetic operations in hardware, especially for negation and addition of numbers with different signs.\n\nB) Excess notation: This representation adds a bias to all numbers, shifting the range of representable values. While useful in some floating-point implementations, it doesn't provide significant advantages for integer arithmetic operations in hardware.\n\nC) Two's complement representation: This is the correct answer. Two's complement allows for efficient negation (inverting all bits and adding 1) and addition operations in hardware. It eliminates the need for separate logic to handle positive and negative numbers during addition, simplifying circuit design and improving performance.\n\nD) One's complement representation: While similar to two's complement, one's complement has the disadvantage of having two representations for zero (+0 and -0). This can complicate comparisons and arithmetic operations, making it less efficient than two's complement in hardware implementations.\n\nThe two's complement representation is preferred in many digital systems due to its simplicity in hardware implementation for common arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with signed integers."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/15", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/245248", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/248419/"], "docs_id": 245248, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a coding question with two compilable options.

He has used fraps to record a video of him playing a game. Fraps is a very game\\-specific program used for capturing video of your game while you play. If his question were about how to record in fraps, troubleshooting fraps somehow, or trying to boost his framerate while using fraps, it would be a perfectly legitimate question. But that is not his question. Rather, badp *already* has a recording made with fraps, and from here wants to know what to do with it.\n\nSpecifically, he wants to know how he can make it a reasonable format to upload to the Internet. So this question, simply stated, is: \"I have a video. How do I transcode it?\" This is a good question; it is very specific and an expert on the subject matter can answer it definitively. However, it is not a question relating to gaming. Back to badp's main argument, that he is a gamer who needs help with a gaming tool. This is invalidated. He is finished using his gaming tool, and rather now needs help with a non\\-gaming\\-related tool. In order to understand this, read [this chat log by TomWij](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/87/conversation/tomwijs-explanation-of-transcoding).\n\nThis is analogous to gamers who program games. Game\\-development questions are disallowed here even though many hardcore gamers, especially on this site, know a fair bit about programming. Just because gamers *might* know the answer to your question doesn't make the question any more relevant to *gaming* itself.\n\n[I guess my real problem is that the alternative is asking on \"anything with a question mark in it that happens to be done with a computer and doesn't belong on any other SE site\"](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/132683#132683) \\- badp\n\nI agree that his question deserves an answer. I just believe that Gaming.SE is not the place to get it.

This process is not directly related to gaming, but rather to video editing and compression.

For example, if you had Mavericks before and want to go to El Capitan, you will have to recover to Mavericks then download the El Capitan Installer.*\n\n### Option 2: Download and Make a USB Installer\n\nThis involves using another Mac from a friend, family member or acquaintance. You will need an 8GB flash drive. There are many guides on [how to create the USB installer](http://osxdaily.com/2015/09/30/create-os-x-el-capitan-boot-install-drive/) so I won't belabor that point here, but the command you will need to execute in Terminal is as follows:\n\n```\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/<USB Volume> --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\n\n```\n\nWhere `<USB Volume>` is the name of your USB Flash Drive (don't use spaces \\- it makes it easier)\n\nAfter about 10 minutes you will have a USB Flash drive to install OS X on your Mac.\n\n### Option 3: Acquire a premade USB Drive\n\n**This is not an official recommendation** but sometimes when you are in a pinch and Options 1 and 2 are simply not feasible, it's nice to know that there's another option. You can find these on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p3984.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xos%20x%20el%20capitan%20san%20disk.TRS0&_nkw=os%20x%20el%20capitan%20san%20disk&_sacat=0).

This approach enhances code clarity and helps avoid confusion that might arise from the different default behaviors in TypeScript (public by default) and C# (private by default).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it maintains TypeScript's default behavior, it doesn't address the potential confusion when working with both languages.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it changes TypeScript's behavior to match C#, which could lead to unintended access restrictions and is not the recommended approach.\n\nOption D is incorrect because avoiding access modifiers altogether would reduce code clarity, especially in a multi-language project where explicit declarations can help prevent misunderstandings.\n\nThe key point is to prioritize clarity and consistency across languages, even if it means being more verbose in TypeScript by explicitly declaring public access modifiers."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/17", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/52456", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/15151/"], "docs_id": 52456, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I click on a link **send to a friend** and want to send the link to some of my friend I have the title **Magento Commerce** displayed in my title tag. \n\nThe question is: how to change it to something else? \n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can change the default page title in the admin panel:\n\n```\nSystem -> Configuration -> GENERAL -> Design -> HTML Head -> Default Title\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento e-commerce platform, you want to customize the default page title that appears when users click on a \"send to a friend\" link. Currently, it displays \"Magento Commerce\" in the title tag. Which of the following paths in the admin panel would you use to change this default title?\n\nA) System -> Configuration -> GENERAL -> Design -> Page Layout -> Default Title\nB) System -> Settings -> GENERAL -> Web -> HTML Head -> Default Title\nC) System -> Configuration -> GENERAL -> Design -> HTML Head -> Default Title\nD) System -> Options -> GENERAL -> Website -> Page Head -> Default Title\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct path to change the default page title in Magento's admin panel is System -> Configuration -> GENERAL -> Design -> HTML Head -> Default Title. This option allows administrators to set a custom default title that will be used across the site, including for features like the \"send to a friend\" link.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"Page Layout\" is not the correct submenu for this setting.\nOption B is incorrect because \"Settings\" and \"Web\" are not part of the correct path.\nOption D is incorrect because \"Options\" and \"Website\" are not part of the correct path, and \"Page Head\" is not the correct term used in Magento's admin panel for this setting."}}
