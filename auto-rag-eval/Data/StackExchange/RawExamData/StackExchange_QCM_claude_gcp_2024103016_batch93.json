In in that drains will be cables. The cables will also be digitized with tracing and end in every drain junction. No cables cross a junction. There could be up to 10 cables inside one drain. The drains are identified by ID's. \n\nEvery cable need a (virtual)field with the ID of the drain in which it lies. With the refFunctions solution: \n\n```\n(geomintersects('drain','drainid')\n\n```\n\nfrom the question linked above, I will get the drain ID for every cable, BUT the cables are also touching other drains at their end/start nodes if there is a junction.

In your example data\\-set however, the cables extent out of the drains so that where `contains` fails, `within` succeeds. And in the reality of floating point numbers, both `contains` and `within` are tricky with entities like lines, but `overlaps`, or `crosses` even, might catch them.\n\nSo just check them all:\n\n```\nCOALESCE( geomwithin( 'drains', 'ID' ),  geomcontains( 'drains', 'ID' ),  geomoverlaps( 'drains', 'ID' ),  geomcrosses( 'drains', 'ID' ))\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with GIS data for drains and cables, which spatial relation predicate would be most appropriate to accurately identify the drain ID for each cable, given that cables may touch multiple drains at junctions?\n\nA) geomintersects\nB) geomwithin\nC) geomcontains\nD) A combination of geomwithin, geomcontains, geomoverlaps, and geomcrosses\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) geomintersects is not ideal because it may return multiple drain IDs for cables touching at junctions, leading to potentially random results.\n\nB) geomwithin alone may not work for all cases, especially if cables extend slightly beyond drain boundaries due to digitizing imprecisions.\n\nC) geomcontains alone may fail if cables are not fully contained within drains due to minor geometric inaccuracies.\n\nD) Using a combination of geomwithin, geomcontains, geomoverlaps, and geomcrosses with the COALESCE function provides the most robust solution. This approach accounts for various geometric relationships between cables and drains, handling cases where cables may slightly extend beyond drains or touch at junctions. The COALESCE function ensures that the first non-null result is returned, improving the accuracy of drain ID assignment for each cable."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/04", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/371119", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/183654/"], "docs_id": 371119, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Wikipedia's article on the [address resolution mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver#Address_resolution_mechanism) of DNS there should be a *\"hint file\"* in my OS somewhere, containing IP addresses of a few *\"root name servers\"*. \n\nHow do I see this hint file on Ubuntu?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You won't find this hint file on every computer.

On the primary side on the main transformer, I have a 15V rail to power the control chip (a FAN6920\\) and a gate drive chip (a FAN7382\\). On this 15V rail, I have roughly 400uF of capacitance. Because of this amount of capacitance, the hiccup time of the supply is about 10 sec. That's the time it take for the 15V rail to decay down to about 5V, at which point the control chip will attempt to start back up. This is acceptable during an actual fault (e.g. an over voltage condition on the output or the output shorted), but this hiccup time is also present when turning the line off and then back on within that 10 seconds. The supply is used to power lights, so as you can imagine, no one wants a potential 10 second delay when they hit the light switch.\n\nTo that end, I'm trying to figure out a way to design a circuit that senses whether the AC line has gone away, and if so, to pull down the 15V rail quickly, while at the same time not impacting steady state operation. \n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/llXvu.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fllXvu.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nMy first attempt at this is above. This idea is that C1 will charge to 10V when the line voltage is applied, holding M2 on. Holding M2 on will hold M1 off. At the same time, C2 is charging to 10V. When the line voltage is disconnected, C1 discharges much quicker than C2, allowing M2 to open up, and allowing C2 to change the gate of M1, turning it on and rapidly discharging the 15V rail through a 10 ohm resistor. However, in practice, C1 doesn't discharge nearly quick enough. It maintains enough voltage to keep M2 on for several seconds, so it doesn't really buy me anything (and also, the charge of C2 decays enough that it can't turn M1 on at that point, anyway). I can't change the time constant of C1 and R2 by much because the voltage across C1 will start drooping significantly when the line crosses 0V.\n\nI am not tied to this topology by any means; this was just my first pass at a solution. And while I've tried a few other things, nothing has really worked, so any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The circuit you've shown (assuming there is 120VAC connected to an unseen bridge rectifier with the '\\-' connected to circuit common) 'looks' like it should work. Obviously those diodes cannot actually be 1N4148s since they're rated at only about 75V.\n\nThe time constant of R2/C1 is less than 10msec so there is no way it should take seconds to discharge (even if you allow for the gate capacitance on the MOSFET\\- presumably you're not actually using that part number, but something much smaller anyway). If there was enough leakage from the main supply capacitor through the main bridge rectifier that could explain it (so the problem would be 'off the page'). \n\nPerhaps if you split the (off the page) bleeder resistor for the input filter into two resistors, each to the common, rather than one resistor across the line.."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a power supply design with an input of 100VAC to 300VAC, a circuit is needed to quickly discharge the 15V rail when AC power is removed.

Splitting the main input filter bleeder resistor into two resistors connected to common would reduce leakage from the main supply capacitor through the bridge rectifier, which could be causing the slow discharge of C1.\nD) Decreasing R2 would speed up C1's discharge, but it might also cause issues with voltage drooping during normal operation when the AC line crosses 0V.\n\nThe key insight is that the problem may lie \"off the page\" in the main input circuit, and modifying the bleeder resistor configuration could help address this without impacting the steady-state operation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/26", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/25102", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/7687/"], "docs_id": 25102, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Currently I have two different controllers and Magento checkout is split into two ways, let's say A and B, thus URL is checkout/A checkout/B \\- both available for customer. Both of them are onepage checkout.\nFor both of them I have layout XML file; for B I'm removing many blocks from whole page so it's very simplified.\nI would like to move these changes to one URL, so by some settings there will be displayed checkout A or checkout B randomly.\nHow to force in custom controller changes that I made with layout XML file? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here I am demonstrating what is your current state(According to my understanding) and how to solve your problem.\n\nSo you have basically two controllers that is defined for checkout. The url paths that invoke your controllers then somewhat look like this `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a` (For controller with name `A`) and `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/b`(For controller with name `B`). I assume `indexAction()` method in your controllers are used to load and render the layouts. They loads their own layouts. Everything is perfect untill here. Now you want to render layout that render by controller B along with layouts of controller A, when `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a` is requested.\n\nYou can achieve this in two ways (There may be other ways). \n\n* Through an event observer\n* through controller A\n\nThrough an event observer\n=========================\n\nWe are going to listen to the event `controller_action_layout_load_before`. This event will call before any layout loads. We will *inject* the layout of controller B to that of control A. So \n\nConfig.xml\n----------\n\n```\n<config>\n    <frontend>\n        <events>\n            <controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                <observers>\n                    <checkout_controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                        <class>programmerrkt_checkout/observer</class>\n                        <method>controllerActionLayoutLoadBefore</method>\n                    </checkout_controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                </observers>\n            </controller_action_layout_load_before>\n        </events>\n    </frontend>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nObserver\n--------\n\n```\n<?php\nclass Programmerrkt_Checkout_Model_Observer\n{\n        const LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_CHECK_WITH = 'checkout_a_index';\n        const LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_ATTACH = 'checkout_b_index';\n        public function controllerActionLayoutLoadBefore(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)\n        {\n            /** @var $layout Mage_Core_Model_Layout_Update */\n            $update = $observer->getEvent()->getLayout()->getUpdate();\n            $handles = $update->getHandles(); //get all handles \n            //If layout handle of controller A is not in action,  will not attach the handles\n            if(in_array(self::LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_CHECK_WITH , $handles))\n            {\n                $update->addHandle(self::LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_ATTACH);\n            }    \n        }\n}\n\n```\n\nThrough Controller Method\n=========================\n\nNow we can load layout of controller B through controller A. This is little tricky. This is because we cannot use `loadLayout()` method, if we are planning to use controller for this purpose. Why ? this [THREAD](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3463030/magento-use-own-handle-in-widgets-doesnt-work) gives an answer for that (checkout alanstorm's answer). In short, if we add handle of controller B (`checkout_b_index` in this case), before or after the method `loadLayout()`, its not going to make any difference. So what we need to do is, we need to replace loadLayout() with our codes, so that `checkout_index_b` handle also added to the layout tree of controller A.\n\nSo your controller A should look like this.\n\n```\n public function indexAction()\n{\n    //code follows some what replaces loadLayout() method\n    $update = $this->getLayout()->getUpdate(); \n    $update->addHandle('default'); //attach layout handle of for controller A\n    $this->addActionLayoutHandles(); \n    $update->addHandle('checkout_b_index'); //attach layout handle of controller B\n    $this->loadLayoutUpdates();\n    $this->generateLayoutXml();\n    $this->generateLayoutBlocks();\n    $this->_isLayoutLoaded = true;\n\n    $this->renderLayout();\n}\n\n```\n\nThat's it. Now load the url `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a`. You can see content of both A and B in there.\n\nCheck my blog for better understanding [http://rajeev\\-k\\-tomy.blogspot.in/2014/06/add\\-layout\\-to\\-another\\-layout.html](http://rajeev-k-tomy.blogspot.in/2014/06/add-layout-to-another-layout.html)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento e-commerce site, you have two different checkout controllers (A and B) with separate layout XML files.

It is certainly convenient to say that at $t$ second the net charge in system was 0 and at $t\\+1$ second it is also zero.

See this image:\n![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Riemann-Sum-right-hand.png)  \n\nMathematically speaking, it's $\\\\int\\_a^bf(x)dx \\= \\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}h\\\\cdot f(a\\+hn)$  \n\n2: Let us replace our measly *f* (*x*) with its definition, in terms of the derivative of *F* (*x*), namely $f(x) \\= \\\\lim\\_{j\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{F(x\\+j)\\-F(x)}{j}$. Thus, our first equation becomes\n$\\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}h\\\\cdot \\\\lim\\_{j\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{F(a\\+hn\\+j)\\-F(a\\+hn)}{j}$\nNow, my question is, since both *h* and *j* are going to zero via a limit, can I assume that they are effectively the same? Can I simply replace all instances of *j* with an *h* and rid myself of an unnecessary second limit? If I could, my proof would continue as follows:\n3: Replacing all *j*'s with *h*'s yields:  \n\n$\\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}h\\\\cdot \\\\frac{F(a\\+h(n\\+1\\))\\-F(a\\+hn)}{h}$, and the *h*s can cancel out: $\\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}F(a\\+h(n\\+1\\))\\-F(a\\+hn)$.  \n\n4: Thankfully, this becomes a telescoping series, as seen here:  \n\n$F(a\\+h(1\\))\\-F(a\\+0h) \\+ F(a\\+h(2\\))\\-F(a\\+1h) \\+ F(a\\+h(3\\))\\-F(a\\+2h) \\+ ... \\= \\-F(a\\-h) \\+ F(b\\-h)$  \n\n$ \\+ F(a\\+h(\\\\frac{b\\-a}{h}))\\-F(a\\+h(\\\\frac{b\\-a}{h}\\-1\\) \\= F(b) \\- F(b\\-h)$  \n\nwhich, together, yields \\-*F* (*a* \\- *h*) \\+ *F* (*b*) as the sum.  \n\nPutting this back in, we get $ \\\\lim\\_{h \\\\to 0} \\-F(a \\- h) \\+ F(b) \\= F(b) \\- F(a) \\= \\\\int\\_a^bf(x)dx \\= F(b)\\-F(a) $\n\nHowever, steps 3 and 4 require the ability for me to assume that *h* and *j* are the same thing. My teacher (who admittedly doesn't deal with this too often), whom I asked first, said that perhaps *h* and *j* are going to 0 at different rates. However, I do not think that the concept of a limit to 0 *at a rate* actually means anything.  \n\nSo the question I bring to you is: Is the operation that I performed to go from step 2 to step 3 a valid operation?

This is because differentiability implies that the limit exists and is the same regardless of how we approach it (in this case, whether h and j approach zero independently or are set equal to each other).

What is the mechanism behind it? \n\nPlease consider answering the questions in edit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We'll start with what a square wave is.\n\nA [square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave#Fourier_analysis) is a bunch of sine waves added together. You have a primary, and a bunch of harmonics added to it. The harmonics are in a particular phase relationship to the primary. The sum of all the waves is a square wave. If you leave any of the sine waves out (or change their phase,) then the sum looks less like an ideal sine wave.\n\nThis image from the Wikipedia page illustrates it clearly:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sdaUx.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sdaUx.gif)\n\nNow, on to the reflections.\n\nIf your transmission line were terminated in a perfect resistor that doesn't match the line impedance (and there were no effects from capacitance or inductance) then the reflection would be a nice, sharp copy of your original square wave.\n\nIn any real circuit, you will have capacitances and inductances to deal with.\n\nThe inductance, capacitance, and resistance of your transmission line will interact with the inductance, capacitance, and resistance of the termination. The result is an impedance that varies with frequency.\n\nA square wave is a collection of sine waves of different frequencies, so different parts of it are more or less strongly reflected. Some frequencies will be slightly delayed, and some won't.\n\nThe result is often that some part is reflected as a somewhat proper looking square wave while other parts are reflected differently enough that you can see the sine wave itself.\n\nWhen neither end is properly terminated, then each sine in the square wave is reflected depending where exactly it \"hits the end.\" \n\nSay you have a transmission line 1 meter long, and a wave one meter long. In this case, there will be no reflection \\- the wave fits exactly in the transmission line.\n\nNow keep the 1 meter transmission line, but change to a wave that is 67 centimeters long. The wave doesn't fit exactly in the transmission line anymore. Part of it will be reflected.\n\nPut the one meter wave and the 67 centimeter wave into the same transmission line at the same time, and you will only see reflections from the 67 centimeter wave.\n\nNow consider your square wave (made of waves of different lengths.) Some parts will reflect more strongly than other parts. If most of the sine waves reflect together, then you might get something that looks like a square wave. You might also get a situation where only a few (or one) frequency reflects strongly \\- in which case you get something that looks like a sine wave as a reflection. That's ringing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A square wave is applied to a transmission line that is not terminated with its characteristic impedance. Which of the following statements best explains the resulting reflection and ringing phenomenon?\n\nA) Only the fundamental frequency of the square wave is reflected, causing sinusoidal ringing.\n\nB) The entire square wave is reflected as a perfect copy, regardless of the transmission line's properties.\n\nC) Different frequency components of the square wave are reflected differently due to varying impedance at different frequencies, potentially resulting in sinusoidal ringing.\n\nD) Ringing occurs only when the transmission line length exactly matches the wavelength of the square wave's fundamental frequency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. A square wave is composed of multiple sine waves of different frequencies (fundamental and harmonics). When applied to a transmission line with imperfect termination, these different frequency components interact differently with the line's inductance, capacitance, and resistance. This causes varying degrees of reflection for different frequencies. Some frequencies may be reflected more strongly or with different phase shifts, which can result in a reflection that appears more sinusoidal (ringing) rather than a perfect square wave. This phenomenon occurs because the impedance of the system varies with frequency, affecting how each component of the square wave is reflected."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/18", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/295571", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/142693/"], "docs_id": 295571, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I use BBEdit to write and test Python scripts, and I usually run the scripts in a terminal process, with the \"Run in Terminal\" command.\nIs there a way to have the terminal process opened by BBEdit stay \"active\", after the script is completed?\nI would like not to have the \n\n```\n[Process completed] \n\n```\n\nmessage and instead to still have an active prompt, either the shell or the the Python environment, with all the variables I have created in the script still existing. \nThis would be similar to the situation when I launch the script from an existing terminal process, either from the shell:\n\n```\n$ python script_name.py\n\n```\n\nor from the python interpreter:\n\n```\n>>> script_name.py\n\n```\n\nIn particular, in the last case, when the script exits, I still have the process active in the terminal window.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As I understand, you have a Python script in BBEdit.\n\n[![Python script](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kF0Rc.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kF0Rc.png)\n\nYou choose to test the code using the \"Run in Terminal\" option from the '\\#!' menu.\n\n[![Run in Terminal](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MdSnL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MdSnL.png)\n\nNow a Terminal window opens, runs the script and exits.\n\n[![exit code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZbwx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZbwx.png)\n\nNow here is the culprit.

I explicitly don't want my user to have to construct query strings themselves, these will all be explicitly typed parameters on my client(s)' methods.\n\nSo, by the time I've handled all of this, my client class could actually be fairly hefty. As a consequence of this, I'm considering creating a client for each endpoint to handle the validation of query parameters and ensure everything is strongly typed. These can then use a basic, generic \"God Mode\" client internally to do the actual querying.\n\nThe god mode client would look something like this:\n\n```cs\npublic class DiscosClient : IDiscosClient\n{\n    private readonly HttpClient _client;\n    public DiscosClient(HttpClient client)\n    {\n        _client = client;\n    }\n\n    public async Task<DiscosResponse<T>?> Get<T>(string endpoint, string query) where T: DiscosModelBase\n    {\n        return await _client.GetFromJsonAsync<DiscosResponse<T>>($\"{endpoint}?{query}\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, this then means I have a whole bunch of clients which could be a bit of a mess in and of itself.\n\nFor example, I'd need `DiscosObject`, `Propellant`, `Orbit` clients with interfaces like these (I've not added filter parameters to my interfaces yet):\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosObjectClient\n{\n    public Task<List<DiscosObject>> GetObjects();\n    public Task<DiscosObject> GetObject();\n    public Task<List<ObjectClass>> GetObjectClasses();\n    public Task<ObjectClass> GetObjectClass();\n}\n\n```\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosPropellantClient\n{\n    public Task<List<Propellant>> GetPropellants();\n    public Task<Propellant> GetPropellant();\n}\n\n```\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosOrbitClient\n{\n    public Task<List<OrbitDetails>> GetInitialOrbits();\n    public Task<OrbitDetails> GetInitialOrbit();\n    public Task<List<OrbitDetails>> GetDestinationOrbits();\n    public Task<OrbitDetails> GetDestinationOrbit();\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat's the best way to approach this?

Though unit tests may be a good point to start, you should write a test application, a proof\\-of\\-concept, something large enough to see how the SDK works in reality, but small enough you can still refactor the application, or throw it over board in case a certain design does not satisfy your expectations.\n\nSoftware design in a vacuum does never work well \\- one needs context, and if there isn't enough context yet, create it by yourself."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing an SDK for a complex API with multiple endpoints, each requiring different query parameters and returning various payload types, what is the recommended approach for structuring the client architecture?\n\nA) Create a single \"super-client\" that handles all endpoints and operations in one large class.\n\nB) Develop separate client classes for each endpoint, with a generic \"God Mode\" client internally handling the actual HTTP requests.\n\nC) Start by writing extensive unit tests for each possible API call and base the design solely on these tests.\n\nD) Begin with a proof-of-concept application that uses the SDK, iteratively refining the design based on real-world usage patterns.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The best approach for designing a complex SDK is to start with a proof-of-concept application that actually uses the SDK in a realistic scenario. This allows the developer to:\n\n1. Gain context and understand how the SDK will be used in practice.\n2. Iteratively refine the design based on real-world usage patterns.\n3. Identify potential issues or inconveniences in the API design that may not be apparent from looking at the specifications alone.\n4. Strike a balance between a monolithic design and overly fragmented architecture.\n5.

We have several 20amp circuits, so we're putting 5 PCs on each 20amp circuit.\n\nHow concerned should we be with extension cord quality? Our plan is to run two 16/3 cables from each circuit, and run about 3 PCs per cord. Should there be any issues with this? Would going with 14/3 cables really be any better?\n\nWe considered going with single 12/3 cables and running all 5/6 PCs from that single cord... but given that the max listed amperage on these is 15A, that doesn't give us the amount of power consumption we're going to require.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Extension cords need to be chosen according to the length and load. The following chart will guide you to the correct gauge to choose for any one extension cord. You might choose several different gauges in order to save money, properly configured you won't need to put 12awg wire everywhere:\n\n![Table, current, cord length, and cord size](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YABR9.png)\n\nTo carry 20 amps any distance, you'll need 12awg cable. You could use one 50 foot 12awg cable to carry the current to a table, then three 16awg cables to carry the current to one or two computers each.\n\nYou might find it cheaper, however, to run two 14awg wires in parallel from one outlet than to run one 12awg wire.\n\nKeep in mind that while some cable calculators and tables will indicate that 16awg can handle 20A, the cable will heat up, and if you've properly secured it to the floor using tape or channels with other cables running parallel, the heat buildup can be significant and dangerous. Particularly with long runs.\n\nYou should also consult with the hotel \\- many of them have requirements for extension cord use in conference areas, and in some cases you will be required to use their cables and installers in order to meet their safety and load planning requirements.\n\nIf you pay attention to the chart you'll note that each cable size and load include a voltage drop. You'll also realize that due to the wiring at the venue you'll see a voltage drop at the outlet as well. This will result in a lower voltage at each computer than 120V. However, as long as you keep your voltage drop below 10%, and the venue is wired correctly producing a less than 10% drop to the outlet under load, then it is unlikely that your computers will experience any problems. Most computing equipment that uses AC power has a universal power supply that accepts a wide range of voltage, often down to 90VAC. It will be a rare computer or peripheral that will have problems with the voltage drop presented by a suitably rated cable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A LAN party organizer is planning to set up 50+ computers, each drawing an average of 3.5 amps.

Which of the following setups would be the safest and most efficient for powering 6 computers from a single 20-amp circuit, assuming the computers are spread across a 50-foot distance?\n\nA) Use a single 50-foot 14 AWG extension cord, branching off to six 16 AWG cords for individual computers\nB) Use two parallel 50-foot 14 AWG extension cords, each powering three computers directly\nC) Use a single 50-foot 12 AWG extension cord, branching off to three 16 AWG cords, each powering two computers\nD) Use a single 50-foot 16 AWG extension cord, branching off to six 18 AWG cords for individual computers\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the safest and most efficient setup. Using a 12 AWG cord for the main 50-foot run ensures it can handle the full 20-amp load without significant voltage drop or overheating. Branching off to shorter 16 AWG cords for pairs of computers allows for proper current distribution without exceeding the capacity of the smaller gauge wires. This setup balances safety, efficiency, and practicality.\n\nOption A is inadequate because 14 AWG is not recommended for 20 amps over 50 feet. Option B, while using two 14 AWG cords improves the situation, it's still not ideal for the full distance and load. Option D is unsafe, as 16 AWG and 18 AWG are too thin for the required current over the given distance."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/04", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/11008", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 11008, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does \"switch to the heart of\" mean in the following sentence?\n\n> Why?

What is the primary purpose of this parameter, and how can a user remove it in Ubuntu 20.04?\n\nA) The parameter is used for tracking user behavior, and it can be removed by editing the Firefox configuration files directly.\n\nB) It's a Firefox bug that can be fixed by updating to the latest version of the browser.\n\nC) The parameter is part of a revenue-sharing agreement, and it can be removed by uninstalling and reinstalling DuckDuckGo as the default search engine in Firefox.\n\nD) It's used to improve search results for Ubuntu users, and it can only be removed by switching to a different search engine.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The \"t=canonical\" parameter is part of DuckDuckGo's partnerships with developers and companies, where a portion of advertising revenue is shared. To remove it in Ubuntu 20.04, users need to:\n1. Open Firefox Preferences and go to the Search section.\n2. Remove the pre-installed DuckDuckGo search engine.\n3. Download the DuckDuckGo search engine again from the Firefox Add-ons directory.\n4. Set the newly installed DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.\n\nThis process effectively reinstalls DuckDuckGo without the Ubuntu-specific parameter, allowing users to perform searches without \"t=canonical\" being added."}}
