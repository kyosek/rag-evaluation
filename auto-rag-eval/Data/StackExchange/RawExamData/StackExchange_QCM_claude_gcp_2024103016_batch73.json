To allow debugging, I use a functional model written in Verilog. In it, the setup and hold time for some signal is set to 1\\.5 ns. If I understand everything correctly, this means that the signal can not change 'within' 1\\.5 ns of a rising clock edge.\n\nHowever, the RTL that I've written does not include timing, so the signal appears to change instantly, yielding hold time warnings.\n\nOn the one hand, I am not too concerned; I'm only getting warnings, and I think that during a project for my university, we were told to simply ignore these errors.\n\nOn the other, I don't like to ignore warnings. The manufacturer would not have implemented these warnings if they have no purpose. Since Xilinx ISE is able to check timing constraints, I feel like it should be possible to route and map my design, and use the generated timings somehow (but maybe I'm making things too simple here).\n\nI'm sure there are more people with the same problem. What is the proper way to deal with these warnings?\n\nEdit: On [this page](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx11/pp_p_process_simulate_post_map_model.htm), I found some more information. You can generate a post\\-map or post\\-place\\-and\\-route simulation model. I suspect this includes the timings. However, it seems only modelsim can actually perform the simulation.\n\nClarification: Ideally, I would be able to synthesize (or at least get as far in the process of generating the layout as possible) my part of the design (I have the RTL and I have specified the board, so I think this should be possible), then combine it in a testbench with the functional model to test if my design has the proper timing delays. However, I can't make this work in Xilinx ISE 14\\.7\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Setup and hold timing checks only make sense with post\\-layout information. A century ago, you could do timing analysis without layout structural information because the the device delays were overwhelming compared to routing delays. You can no longer do accurate timing analysis with RTL code.\n\nSome models are written to be used in both RTL and structural simulations, so you can ignore these warnings. Even better would be to turn of the timing checks which improves RTL simulation performance (maybe not relevant on your project, but that what people do in industry)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In FPGA design, when dealing with setup and hold time warnings during RTL simulation, what is the most appropriate approach?\n\nA) Always ignore these warnings as they are not relevant in RTL simulations\nB) Modify the RTL code to include precise timing information\nC) Turn off timing checks to improve RTL simulation performance\nD) Use post-layout information to accurately assess timing issues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to turn off timing checks during RTL simulation. This is because setup and hold timing checks are not meaningful at the RTL level, where timing information is not yet available. Turning off these checks can improve simulation performance without compromising the validity of the RTL simulation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while these warnings can often be ignored in RTL simulations, it's not always the best practice to ignore all warnings indiscriminately.\n\nOption B is incorrect because adding precise timing information to RTL code is not typically done and would be impractical, as timing is largely dependent on the physical layout which is not yet determined at the RTL stage.\n\nOption D, while important for final timing analysis, is not applicable during RTL simulation.

Holobore in Ruby provides a stronger base CPS boost than in Jade. Jeremy in Jade offers additional CPS increase.

Can anyone help me debug it or even help me understand what I did wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your code has several structural problems with the reactives and so on, and some possible more fundamental problems with shapefile.\n\nHere's a working version *with some caveats* that follow:\n\n```\nui=shinyUI(fluidPage(pageWithSidebar(\n  headerPanel(\"Header1\"),\n  sidebarPanel(\n      fileInput('layer', 'Choose Layer', multiple=FALSE, accept='asc'),\n      fileInput('shape', 'Choose gml', multiple=FALSE, accept=\"gml\")\n\n  ),\n  mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"mapPlot\")\n  )\n)))\n\nserver = shinyServer(function(input,output){\n\n    inFile <- reactive({\n        raster::brick(input$layer$datapath)\n    })\n\n    inShp = reactive({\n        readOGR(input$shape$datapath)\n    })\n\n    output$mapPlot<-renderPlot(\n    {\n        plot(inFile());\n        plot(inShp(), add=TRUE)\n    })\n})\n\n```\n\nNote that everything in the server function is either in a \"reactive\" or a \"renderer\". That's what was causing your initial problem.\n\nSecondly the file upload input returns a data frame with a `datapath` column which is where the file has been dropped. So in your code you would have been trying to read from `input$layer` which is a dataframe of upload data rather than `input$layer$datapath` which is the column with the file name you want.\n\nThirdly it is hard to make shapefiles work with shiny uploads. Shapefiles must have a `.shp` and a `.shx` component for `readOGR` to work, and possibly a `.dbf` and `.prj` component too. You can upload several files in a shiny upload widget (is that why you have `multiple=T`?) but the server renames them so that the data frame of `input$shape` contains the names `0.shp`, `1.shx`, `2.dbf` and so on. It might be possibly to rename these back together, but most shapefile upload solutions require users to upload a ZIP file of everything which is then extracted by the server.\n\nMy solution above, and in order to show how the reactive stuff works which was your first problem, is to load a GML file instead of a shapefile. In my test code I did `writeOGR(pts, \"pts.gml\",\"pts\", driver=\"GML\")` just to get something I could upload to shiny and plot over a raster."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Shiny app for uploading and plotting spatial data, which of the following statements is correct regarding the server function and file input handling?\n\nA) The server function can directly access input values without using reactive expressions.\n\nB) File input values (e.g., input$layer) can be used directly in functions like raster::brick() without accessing the datapath.\n\nC) Reactive expressions are only necessary for complex calculations, not for basic input handling.\n\nD) File input values should be accessed using input$filename$datapath, and all server logic should be wrapped in reactive expressions or renderers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct approach in Shiny apps is to wrap server logic in reactive expressions or renderers, and to access file inputs using the datapath. Option D correctly states that file input values should be accessed using input$filename$datapath, and all server logic should be in reactive expressions or renderers.

(And of course in POTS there's no metadata at all.) 3GPP TS 24\\.008 might be a good place to start looking; it contains the formats of the actual radio packets that are sent and received to set up or tear down a voice call.\n\nI'm not familiar with the newer (4G, LTE, etc) interfaces and they might be able to carry more call metadata, but whether metadata sent by one handset will make it across the network to another handset, or whether any phones have APIs to send or receive that data, is another question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ability of cell phone apps to relay custom data along with a phone call?\n\nA) Custom data can easily be added to call headers and will be reliably transmitted across all cellular networks.\n\nB) The 3GPP TS 24.008 standard defines extensive metadata fields that apps can use to send custom data during call initiation.\n\nC) Classic GSM/3G/UMTS systems have limited metadata capacity beyond basic call information, but newer 4G/LTE systems may offer more possibilities for custom data transmission.\n\nD) All cellular standards prohibit the transmission of any custom app data alongside call initiation packets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Do I see it as the adjective, dropping the pronoun \"one\"? \n\nI think it should be like this:\n\nthis is the closest **one (that)** I've ever gotten to a college graduation.\n\nRight?\n\nIf that's the case, should I think \"the closest\" is basically the object of a verb \"have gotten\"?\n\nThen, what is the meaning of \"get\" in here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.\n\nAlmost, but not quite. This sentence does indeed involve a relative clause. We could reconstruct the relative clause like this:\n\n* Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest **that I've ever gotten to a college graduation.**\n\nThe important thing about relative clauses is that they have a gap in them. The gap tells us where the missing element should be. So for example consider this sentence:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw yesterday].\n\nThis relative clause has a gap in it that tells you where *the man* would be in the clause:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw \\_\\_\\_ yesterday].\n\nBecause our language brain knows where the gap is we can understand the sentence like this:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw **the man** yesterday].\n\n**The relative clause**\n\nIt is not straightforward to understand exactly where the gap is here. This is because, as the Original Poster felt, we often associate relative clauses with a noun phrase antecedent. However, in this case the antecedent isn't a typical noun phrase. Here's where the gap is:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten \\_\\_\\_\\_ to a college graduation]\n\nWe understand it like this:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten **close** to a college graduation].\n\nThis sentence is unusual because it has a superlative adjective as an antecedent, not a noun or clause. The verb *gotten* her means something like *come* or *been*.\n\n**The grammatical function of *closest***\n\nThe Original Poster asks if *the closest* is the Object of the verb *GET*, in this case part of the perfect construction *have gotten*. The answer is, no. However, it has a function similar to an Object. Like an Object, it is a Complement of the verb. But it is a Predicative Complement, not an Object. Like Objects, Predicative Complements fill a special slot set up by the verb. They don't tell us *what* someone was doing something to though and they don't introduce a new entity into the sentence. Instead Predicative Complements tell us something about the Subject or Object of the sentence. \n\nIn this case, the phrase *the closest that I've ever got to a college graduation* is the Predicative Complement of the verb *is*. It describes the situation denoted by *this*. Notice that this is *NOT* an adverbial. It is not an extra part of the grammar in the sentence. It is not an extraneous addition to the meaning either. The sentence is quite simply ungrammatical without it:\n\n> \\*Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is.

It is not the direct object of \"have gotten,\" as the verb \"get\" in this context means something like \"come\" or \"been.\" It's not an adverbial modifier because it's not an extra or extraneous part of the sentence - the sentence would be ungrammatical without it. It's definitely not an indirect object. \n\nAs a predicative complement, \"the closest\" fills a special slot set up by the verb (in this case, \"is\") and tells us something about the subject of the sentence (\"this\").

On the other hand, the `SHOW STATUS;` query provides session-level statistics that reset when the database connection terminates. To obtain the same global statistics directly from MySQL that phpMyAdmin displays, the correct query to use is `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;`. This query will return cumulative statistics from the MySQL server's start time, matching what is shown in phpMyAdmin."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/154757", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/55724/"], "docs_id": 154757, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am making a pretty standard PHP sign up form that will validate the data the user entered and then redirect to a page with a success message. I would like to store this data in a database. Should I insert this information into the database before I redirect the page or after it is redirected? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The pattern for the success case:\n\n1. Read POST request\n2. Validate POST data\n3. Pre\\-process POST data\n4. Store\n5. Redirect\n6. Read GET request\n7. Display success message\n\nAnd in the failure case:\n\n1. Read POST request\n2. Validate POST data (if fail, go to 5\\.)\n3. Pre\\-process POST data (if fail, go to 5\\.)\n4. Store (fails)\n5. Display error message\n\nIn your code, this structure looks somewhat like so (pseudocode, obviously):\n\n```\nif (is_post_request) {\n    data = empty_data()\n    try {\n        data = read_post_data()\n        validate(data)\n        preprocess(data)\n        store(data)\n        redirect()\n        exit\n    }\n    catch (ex) {\n        display_form(data, error_message = ex)\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    data = empty_data()\n    display_form(data, error_message = NULL)\n}\n\n```\n\nThe reason you're redirecting is that you want to avoid a second database update when the user reloads. Because of this, you need to *first* store and *then* redirect. In fact, I recommend you make a habit of calling `exit` immediately after each redirect. There is no point in doing anything whatsoever in the current request once you've redirected (except cleanup, such as closing open file handles).\n\nThe reason you *don't* redirect in the error case is because nothing has been stored yet \\- if the user reloads, they'll just run into the same error again. If you were to redirect in the error case, you'd have to carry the error messages over the redirect, which is possible but not really pretty, and you'd have an unnecessary round trip."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a PHP sign-up form that validates user data and stores it in a database before redirecting to a success page, what is the correct order of operations?\n\nA) 1.

This sequence follows the best practices outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. First, we read the POST request to get the user's input.\n2. We then validate the POST data to ensure it meets our requirements.\n3. If validation passes, we pre-process the data as needed.\n4. We store the data in the database before redirecting.\n5. Only after successful storage do we redirect the user.\n6. On the new page (after redirect), we read the GET request.\n7. Finally, we display the success message.\n\nThis order ensures that data is stored before redirecting, preventing issues with duplicate submissions on page reload. It also separates the processing (POST) from the display of results (GET), following the Post/Redirect/Get pattern.

Option D is incorrect because it attempts to store data after redirecting, which would not work as expected."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/11/10", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/145850", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/63992/"], "docs_id": 145850, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are neutrinos less 'dense' than photons?\n\nI am referring to the fact that neither particle has 'mass' in a conventional sense. In terms of particle interaction, is there a substantial 'size' difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The temptation is to think of a particle as a little ball whizzing around space, and it therefore makes sense to ask about the size and density of the ball. The trouble is that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a particle is.\n\nOur current best description of particles is using quantum field theory. This describes particles as excitations in quantum fields that pervade all of spacetime. You create a particle by adding energy to the quantum field, and a particle is destroyed by removing energy from the quantum field. Incidentally, this is how particles like the Higgs boson can be created in colliders \\- the energy of motion of the colliding particles is transferred into excitations of quantum fields where it appears as new particles.\n\nAnyhow, these excitations are delocalised and don't have a well defined position and size, so you can't ask *what is a neutrino's size* because the answer is that it doesn't have a size in the usual sense. You can try and confine a particle by interacting with it, and this gives you answers like *there is a 99% probability that the particle is within this cubic femtometre*. But this obviously isn't a *size* as we usually mean the word. A *size* would mean a minimum distance below which we can't confine the particle any further.\n\nTo confine the particle to smaller and smaller distances needs large and large energies. At the biggest energies we can create (in the LHC) fundamental particles like electrons still have no detectable size. Indeed in quantum field theory there is no minimum size \\- by making the energy arbitrarily high we can confine particles to arbitrarily small regions of space. String theory may change this if it turns out to be a useful description, but at present no\\-one knows for for sure if it is.\n\nSo the answer to your question is that it has no answer because particles don't have a size, and therefore don't have a density. Sorry!"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to quantum field theory, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the nature of fundamental particles?\n\nA) Particles have a well-defined size and density, which can be measured precisely using high-energy colliders.\n\nB) Particles are excitations in quantum fields that pervade all of spacetime, and do not have a conventional size or density.\n\nC) Particles have a minimum size below which they cannot be confined, determined by the Planck length.\n\nD) The size of a particle is directly proportional to its mass, with massless particles having zero size.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to quantum field theory, particles are not tiny balls with defined sizes, but rather excitations in quantum fields that permeate all of spacetime. They don't have a conventional size or density as we typically understand these concepts for macroscopic objects.\n\nOption A is incorrect because particles don't have a well-defined size or density that can be measured precisely, even with high-energy colliders.\n\nOption C is incorrect because quantum field theory doesn't propose a minimum size for particles. In theory, with enough energy, particles could be confined to arbitrarily small regions of space.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no direct relationship between a particle's mass and its \"size\" in quantum field theory.

In this development plan we have different categories: buildings, streets, park area/open space, estates. \n\nAt first, I had a seperate layer for each categorie, until I realized that everytime a change is made in the plan, It is important to check all the other layers and make sure, that topology is still intact.

From [Joe's post on meta](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes):\n\n> We're introducing a new product, [Teams](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/11/09/why-channels/) (n\u00e9e channels), and doing the requisite [research and design thinking](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/12/04/designing-channels/) to get it right. In addition, early on we realized that we have a unique opportunity to pay off technical debt that prevented us from serving Stack Exchange communities as well as we should have been.\n\nThere are something like 60 similar, but not compatible themes plus \\~100 sites that share the \"beta blue\" theme. [In 2016](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/01/26/year-in-review-2016/), our designers pushed out one design a month in an effort to catch up with the rate sites were graduating. [In 2017](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/31/stack-exchange-2017-review/), we had zero new designs. We've painted ourselves into a corner and need to give our designers some space to work with. We never again want to [utter the words](https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/12/04/a-new-top-bar-for-stack-exchange/):\n\n> It turns out that when you try to pick a color to match 40 different site designs, you quickly realize you only have one real choice: black.\n\nTo get an idea of how the standard theme is implemented, you can look at [the CSS and pattern library documentation](https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/using-stacks). (We've never had design documentation in the past, in part, because there is so much variation in site design.) [Standard design frameworks](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/253359/list-of-communities-with-base-css-updates-completed) have proved an effective way to [squash long\\-standing design bugs](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267265/sff-and-mi-yodeya-and-other-sites-without-css-update-are-experiencing-odd-link) in the past and I expect the standard theme will eliminate many existing problems and prevent many more in the future.\n\n[Giving sites customized designs](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/265813/give-graduated-sites-waiting-on-a-custom-design-something-to-set-themselves-apar) is a big part in our ongoing effort to [rationalize the site lifecycle](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites). ([Opening more sites to moderator elections](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314459/experimenting-with-pro-tempore-elections) is another piece to the puzzle.) Unique community designs (and, by extention, brands) is one way we can invest in the Stack Exchange network. Not so obvious right now, but a standard theme also allows us to port Stack Overflow\\-exclusive features to other sites; new features that target Stack Overflow, Enterprise or Teams will probably stay locked into those platforms as long as we don't have a common design to target. \n\nI would have liked these changes to be rolled out with the [custom question list feature](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312781/custom-question-lists-finding-questions-you-can-answer). That would have given everyone something to like about the changes other than a promise of fewer design bugs in the future. I know this state of affairs is not very satisfying.\n\nHow we get feedback\n-------------------\n\nReading the responses to [What does constructive criticism of a design change look like?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/314089/1438), it occured to me that people might not understand where meta feedback is most valuable. [Meta was started](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/28/cmon-get-meta/), in part, due to [my suggestion on UserVoice](https://web.archive.org/web/20090522110810/http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com:80/pages/1722-general/suggestions/106921-provide-an-authorized-location-for-meta-discussion-):\n\n> I know this has been declined multiple times, but I really think it's time to consider the problem of meta\\-discussions on the site.\n\nIn those day, nearly a decade ago, Stack Overflow was growing quickly and active users were an important source of ideas and feature requests. But, as you can see from the quote, most suggestions were declined. Usually they were declined with no explanation or terse pronouncements. Meta, by contrast, has turned out to be incredibly useful for working out certain types of features like [the review queue indicator](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305893/what-criteria-should-we-use-to-determine-which-review-queue-indicator-a-site-wil). It gives developers and users space to discuss the workings of the site in detail. **Reasoned arguments on meta provide feedback that can't be reproduced elsewhere.**\n\nUnfortunately, we haven't always used that space to its best advantage. Jeff has talked about this in [Listen to Your Community, But Don't Let Them Tell You What to Do](https://blog.codinghorror.com/listen-to-your-community-but-dont-let-them-tell-you-what-to-do/). In contrast to his habit of declining suggestions quickly, we've swung to the opposite extreme. Ideas languish on meta. Once in a while, we'll dig up an old idea, but more often your hard work convincing us to do something goes unanswered. That doesn't mean it lacks value, however. When I wrote that UserVoice suggestion, I just wanted to have a place for meta\\-discussions even if the company ignored them. \n\nIn the last couple of years, we've cultivated other types of feedback. For instance, the [blog post that introduced the navigation changes](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/) incorporated feedback from user interviews. From these tests, we can observe what happens when people try to use the interface. [Direct feedback as people learn](http://jericson.github.io/2016/06/30/usability_tests.html) about the changes can only be reproduced on meta if the user is very diligent to record their own experiences in detail. Even then, it'd be just one of the [\\~5 individuals](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) you need for good results. Since we do user interviews more frequently than in the past, we often have a good idea of what does or does not work in the UI before presenting it to meta.\n\nWe also use A/B tests and usage statistics. In the case of the left\\-hand sidebar, it's easy to spot when we made the change on Stack Overflow:\n\n[![Stack Overflow navigation usage](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZGOQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZGOQ.png)\n\nMeta feedback such as \"I have a hard time finding the [questions page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)\" is especially useful if the data shows this is a common problem. If your concern happens to be less common, it requires more information about what makes your use case notable. Even then, it might be impossible to fix without breaking something for others.\n\nBy the way, the other sites that have [received the new theme](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes) show a pattern unlike Stack Overflow:\n\n[![Non-SO navigation usage](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXIny.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXIny.png)\n\nSince Stack Overflow is a critical part of many programmers' workflow, we get criticism from outside the community. Traditionally, we've ignored that input because people who are not active on the sites tend not to understand how the sausage is made. Recently, however, we've [heard criticism](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52) that we've taken to heart and responded to. If you can find the truth buried within [misunderstandings of outsiders](https://twitter.com/thedimishra/status/934988697107185664) it can be useful to hear from the largely\\-silent majority of people who use the site passively.\n\nFinally, there are internal considerations such as input from other parts of the business. [Adding navigation support for Teams](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/) was a key reason we embarked on this round of changes, if you recall. We strive for transparency, but don't always succeed. Then there are trivial issues like the way our code is structured or people going on vacation or disagreements about how to do things that can have outsized effects on what we are able to do. Sometimes we fail to predict what information is most relevant. \n\nWorking with you to improve the feedback cycle\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe sense I get from reading answers and comments here is that the frustration many of you feel stems from a lack of agency over the features, design and operation of the site(s) you love. The express goal of the standard theme is to support Teams, a feature many people will never get to use and probably will never be deployed to most sites. I'd guess everyone who uses meta regularly has a pet feature or bug that they wish we'd spend time on.\n\nIn addition, while the change will help sites without designs get their own distinctive brand in time, the predominate effect so far has been to *water down existing site designs*. Since Stack Overflow was the base upon which the standard was built, sites like Math and TeX look a lot more like Stack Overflow than they used to. And let's not underestimate the very real cost changing a UI has on people. **It should be no surprise that people feel angry and helpless.**\n\nBoth the DAG and community teams are working on ways to make the transition less shocking and get important feedback sooner as we continue converting sites to the standard theme. To [quote Tim](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/373227/1438):\n\n> We're still a growing and relatively small company with limited resources. While we don't struggle and thrash around in the name of profitability, we're still going to struggle and thrash around as we encounter even scarier problems that come with becoming more established. We're *way* more public and open than anyone else and as you can see, it has been a heck of a ride. We wish we could do everything, right now, and make everyone happy. We'll get there.\n\nYou know how companies that put you on hold always say \"Your call is very important to us\"? Yeah, I don't believe it either. Then again, you gotta feel for them since many companies *do* care about keeping customers happy, but can't afford to have a call center full of people waiting around to give individualized service. So they gotta say *something* while you wait. Fortunately, as a software company, we can do more than ask you to reboot your router (as my ISP invariably asks). Sometimes we can [fix things twice](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/) and get at the root problem.\n\nAt any rate, we can do better and maybe you have some practical ideas. How can we serve you better while still meeting our goal to standardize all 174 site themes? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems to me that the timing of all of this is just deeply unfortunate. \n\nIn my some three year experience with Stack Exchange as a whole, new features had to be fought over. You had to have broad community support, a highly upvoted meta post, a sharp and unassailable argument and business case, and quite a bit of luck to get your feature implemented. It was a unforgiving process that frustrated many people because it seemed like nothing was getting done, but it felt *fair*, because everyone and their pet feature request had to go through it. Now\n\n> Since Stack Overflow is a critical part of many programmers' workflow,\n>  we get criticism from outside the community.

I don't assume any malice of intent, I think y'all heard criticism you've really taken to heart and I'm not about to try and discredit that criticism or its validity in any way, but after **years** of being utterly unapproachable in the way of letting public suggestions affect large changes, you start to roll out a bunch of them. Not because the community asked for it (actually despite large contingents of the community asking you not to do it), but because **outsiders** with seemingly no stake or contribution to the success of the site asked for it.\n\nThis has a really bad and demoralizing PR look for all the people who've been patiently chipping away, spending their time, making their cases, for their suggestions to go nowhere. Now suddenly someone makes a few tweets or a blog post and you're reacting? Regardless of what it actually is, it just **feels** unfair and contemptuous. You have to really stretch and force yourself to assume good intent to not be insulted by that.\n\nI'm not sure what the solution can be, but in the three years since joining this site and all the meta activity I've read before then I've never seen this amount of outright cynicism and dislike towards SE the company. It seems like the majority of the default trust and goodwill y'all used to have has been spent and replaced by cynicism and negativity. It is really sad to see rational discourse go off a cliff so dramatically."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: According to the post, which of the following best describes the main issue with the timing of Stack Exchange's recent changes?\n\nA) The changes were implemented too slowly, frustrating users who had been waiting for improvements.\n\nB) The changes were made without any user feedback or testing, leading to poor reception.\n\nC) The changes were made in response to outsider criticism, after years of ignoring internal community suggestions.\n\nD) The changes were too minor and did not address the core issues raised by the community.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The post highlights that for years, the Stack Exchange community had to fight hard to get new features implemented, with a rigorous process involving community support, upvoted meta posts, and strong arguments.

I have no data on how frequently a person visits a city, the order they visit cities in, or time between visits. Just whether or not they were there (technically speaking, a 0 does not guarantee they weren't there, just that they weren't detected there. For simplicity, I think it might be best to not worry about this at this point).\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is use this information with community detection algorithms to see if I can identify how cities are clustered together without using any kind of geographic data. If you think about it, at the highest level, you might expect some kind of regional clustering of cities at the scale of a state or country. Then if there is some kind of regional clustering, then within each of those regions, the next level might be clusters of major urban areas made up of lots of cities. And of course, there might be solitary rural cities. My expectation is that people are more likely to visit areas that are more convenient to travel to, whether it's for work, recreation, shopping, etc, and that this can be used to identify community structure.\n\nI look at this data and can see it being visualized as a graph in several different ways. It could easily be viewed as a hypergraph, or as a multigraph, or as a bipartite graph. For some of the stuff I've tried, I'm collapsing it into a complete weighted graph. What I've tried so far is creating a pairwise adjacency matrix of the cities with a single similarity or distance metric for each pair of cities (in my case, I've been using the Jaccard index). I have then been using this adjacency matrix with community detection algorithms in iGraph that try to maximize modularity. To a degree, this works. I can see the regional clustering that makes sense based on geographic features. However, trying to perform the same process within these regions does not seem to work as well. I also notice that individuals that occur at more cities tend to make things worse, and the community detection process works better when they are removed. However, from a randomized sampling standpoint, arbitrarily removing these people is terrible. I'm also not sure if these community detection algorithms are really intended to be used with complete graphs. On top of that, I don't understand modularity well enough yet to know if its limitations are coming into play.\n\nAnother interesting approach I've seen but haven't tried is using a simulated annealing algorithm with the data in a bipartite graph to maximize modularity.\n\nI guess my question is, what approaches would you recommend for community detection with this type of data, and where there is the potential for hierarchical structure?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The H\\-Volume is the volume contained by the rectangle $\\[x\\_1,x\\_2] \\\\times \\[y\\_1,y\\_2]$ of a 3\\-dimensional function $H(x,y)$. To visualize this, see the Figure [![H-Volume of the $\\Pi$ copula](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZcl3.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZcl3.png)\n\nwhich is the contour plot of the independence copula (which is simply a 3\\-dimensional function with some special properties that make it a copula function).\n\nThe H\\-Volume is the volume contained within the box labeled $R3$. However, remember that the Copula function is defined as the H\\-Volume of the copula function $H$ from $\\[0,u] \\\\times \\[0,v]$. Thus, $H(x\\_2,y\\_2\\)$ in reference to the figure would be the volume contained by $R1\\+R2\\+R3\\+R4$. To get the region of interest, which is just $\\[x\\_1,x\\_2] \\\\times \\[y\\_1,y\\_2]$, we must subtract out $R2$ and $R4$. However, by subtracting out $R2$ and $R4$, we have also subtracted out $R1$ twice. We thus add $R1$ back into the equation (recall that $R1$ is included when computing $H(x\\_2,y\\_2\\)$. \n\nTo think about it in 3\\-D terms, see the Figure [![H-Volume of the $\\Pi$ copula 3-D Visualization](https://i.stack.imgur.com/69bQf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/69bQf.png).

The remaining questions are not separate paragraphs, but part of the first paragraph and therefore there is no indentation.\n\nYou can either place `\\noindent` before the first question, or (since you say you like the appearance of the first question) you can place `\\par` or a linebreak after each of the `tabularx` environments.\n\nI would suggest that you define an environment for your questions. Something like,\n\n```\n\\newcounter{myquestioncounter}\n\\newenvironment{myquestion}[1]\n    {%\n      \\tabularx{\\linewidth}{cX}%\n      \\stepcounter{myquestioncounter}\\themyquestioncounter.\\ \n      & #1: \\\\ & \n    }\n    {%   \n      \\endtabularx\n      \\par\n     }\n\n```\n\nIt will better automate a lot of what you're trying to accomplish. You'll be able to write:\n\n```\n\\begin{myquestion}{MICROBE}\n  \\begin{choicelist}\n    \\item       large marine animal\n    \\item       in order of time\n    \\item       tiny creature\n    \\item       no government\n  \\end{choicelist}\n\\end{myquestion}\n\n```\n\nOr if you load the `environ` package, you can do this a bit more efficiently,\n\n```\n\\NewEnviron{varquestion}[1]\n    {\n      \\begin{tabularx}{\\linewidth}{cX}%\n      \\stepcounter{myquestioncounter}\\themyquestioncounter.\\ \n      & #1: \\\\ & \n      \\begin{choicelist}\n      \\BODY\n      \\end{choicelist}\n      \\end{tabularx}\\par\n    }\n\n```\n\nand then format your questions as \n\n```\n\\begin{varquestion}{INSCRIBE}\n    \\item someone who tells stories\n    \\item to write on something\n    \\item indiscriminate\n    \\item delete\n\\end{varquestion}\n\n```\n\nThe *question* argument can contain text that needs to wrap, but then you probably don't want the `:` at the end of the sentence. So you can redefine the environment as \n\n```\n\\NewEnviron{varquestion}[2][:]\n    {\n      \\begin{tabularx}{\\dimexpr\\linewidth-1em}{cX}%\n      \\stepcounter{myquestioncounter}\\themyquestioncounter.\\ \n      & #2#1 \\\\ & \n      \\begin{choicelist}\n      \\BODY\n      \\end{choicelist}\n      \\end{tabularx}\\hspace*{1em}\\par\n    }\n\n```\n\nwhere the first argument is optional and assumes that you'll end the question with a `:`, but you can call it as:\n\n```\n\\begin{varquestion}[]{This is just a random question that may span more\nthan one line of the final document. }\n    \\item someone who tells stories\n    \\item to write on something\n    \\item indiscriminate\n    \\item

A *factor* is a von Neumann algebra with a trivial center. The *center* is the intersection with the commutant. A *von Neumann algebra* is an algebra of bounded operators on an Hilbert space, closed by taking bicommutant and dual. Here, $R$ is the hyperfinite $II\\_{1}$ factor. $R^{G}$ is the subfactor of $R$ containing all the elements of $R$ invariant under the natural action of the finite group $G$. In its [thesis](http://www.ams.org/books/memo/0237/), Vaughan Jones shows that, for all finite group $G$, this action exists and is unique (up to outer conjugacy, see [here](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/%7Eu0018768/artikels/bourbaki-popa.pdf) p8\\), and the subfactor $R^{G} \\\\subset R$ completely characterizes the group $G$.

And within an uncontrolled event, my 4GB system disk is full.\n\nWhen I try to uninstall some program by `sudo apt-get purge program-name`, it gives me this error:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/mandb: can't write to /var/cache/man/25843: No space left on device\n\n```\n\nIs there any system file that can be deleted in this situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You will need to delete some files so that you have a minimum amount of free space again. Which ones to delete will depend on the even that filled up the disk in the first place. Surely some unnecessary files have been created somewhere along the line, your best bet is to find them and delete them!\n\nWhat can sometimes happen when a program gets out of control is that it can produce excessively large log files with multiple repeated messages. You can check the `/var/log` directory for this. A good command to use is:\n\n```\n du -ah /var/log | sort -h\n\n```\n\nThis will sort the largest files at the bottom, so that you can easily see if something has got out of control. The `/tmp` directory (if it is part of your root filesystem) is another good place to look for problem files.\n\nAnother place to look is `/var/cache/apt/archives/`, this contains the cache of `.deb` packages downloaded by `apt`. Files here can be safely removed with `apt-get clean`.\n\nIf you can't find any other files to delete (although perhaps another users home directory is the place to try a `du`), deleting old log files is probably the safest way to go. Many of the files in `/var/log` will have numbers after them, the higher the number, the older the log. Many will also have a `.gz` extension, this is just because they have been compressed to save space.\n\nOther places worth checking are `/opt` (some non\\-distro programs use this), `/root` (the home directory for the root user).\n\n`aptitude` can be used to purge all configuration files for removed packages. Although typically this will only free a few MBs at best (and won't work if the disk is so full that `apt-get` won't work). The command line is:\n\n```\nsudo aptitude purge '~c'\n\n```\n\nGenerally I wouldn't recommend uninstalling software unless you really have to, though perhaps the reason for the disk being full is that someone has been installing too much software."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Linux system administrator is faced with a full 4GB system disk.

Examining and removing large log files, especially older ones (indicated by higher numbers or .gz compression), can quickly free up significant space without risking system stability. This approach allows for targeted removal of non-essential data.\n\nOption A, while potentially helpful, typically only frees a small amount of space and may not work if the disk is completely full.\n\nOption B is risky as it involves deleting potentially important files in /opt, which could contain necessary programs.\n\nOption D is not recommended as a first step, as uninstalling programs could remove essential software and potentially cause more problems.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows the administrator to identify the source of the space issue and safely remove unnecessary files, making room for critical system operations."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/03/26", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/136225", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/84044/"], "docs_id": 136225, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to wire mirror heating pads that are placed behind the mirror.

By updating the code to check if the value is an array and convert it to an empty string if so, we can prevent the error from occurring.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the issue is not related to exception handling in the PaymentInformationManagement class, but rather how data is prepared for database insertion.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increasing the timeout limit would not address the root cause of the error, which is related to data type handling.\n\nOption D is an extreme solution that doesn't address the underlying issue and would unnecessarily limit payment options for users."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/11", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6653027", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/606559/"], "docs_id": 6653027, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am doing a barcode scanning app in android.

The evaporation of the plain puddle is limited by the surface area of the water. A towel provides many capillary pathways for the water to diffuse thru the fabric, eventually presenting a much larger surface are for evaporation. Other fabrics could be hydrophobic and decrease overall water/air surface area, but the point of a towel is to do the opposite.\n\nAssuming the towel is clean and not causing additional impurities to dissolve into the water, the vapor pressure of the water should still be the same. The towel is then just a mechanical support for lots of capillary channels. I don't think the vapor pressure is lower just because the water is held by capillary action between structures like cloth fibers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A puddle of water and an identical volume of water absorbed by a clean towel are placed side by side in identical environmental conditions.

The towel provides many capillary pathways for the water to diffuse through the fabric, presenting a much larger surface area for evaporation compared to the plain puddle. While the vapor pressure of the water remains the same in both cases, the mechanical structure of the towel allows for a greater exposed surface area, accelerating the evaporation process. The puddle's evaporation is limited by its surface area in contact with the air, whereas the towel's structure maximizes this contact, leading to faster evaporation."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/29", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/616075", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/298957/"], "docs_id": 616075, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just downloaded `VSCode-linux-x64` from [the Microsoft website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup).

The circuit I used is the simplest one I could find:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUXQ4.png)\n\nI tried without a ground and with the ground from the power outlet (I heard that this was dangerous, but it's the next best thing I have to a rod in the ground). The result was the same for both. I transmitted from my radio at around 145 MHz. The moment I keyed, I could hear a small click on the earpiece, but nothing more. I couldn't hear myself when I spoke into the microphone.\n\nHere's a picture of the actual circuit:![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzQ1d.jpg)\n\nI believe the diode is a 1N34A.\n\nMy guesses at the problem were impedance mismatch and the lack of a good ground, but I also remember that the only issue that would cause is a weaker signal, and I'm right next to the transmitting station, so I'm not sure if that's the reason I can't hear anything. It's really discouraging to spend money on something that doesn't work, so before I go out to get a grounding rod and a sledgehammer or a huge length of wire for an antenna, are those likely to be the reasons I'm not getting any sound? What else could the problem be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That's a very very very very minimalist circuit and very 'laid back' construction. It will work with a suitably high impedance ear\\-piece and proper construction and enough transmitter power and close proximity and ... ie It MAY work but it's not surprising if it doesn't as there are too many potential pitfalls. \n\n* The earpiece looks like it is low impedance \\- either 8 ohms or perhaps a few hundred ohms. \n\nWithout a tuned circuit you need all the sensitivity and lack of loading that you can get. Use of a very very high impedance \"crystal earpiece\" will make a significant difference.\n* Your general construction is excessively rough for what you are trying to do. You MAY make it work but one bad join may doom it and stability is unlikely.\n* Your wiring lengths and stray capacitance and inductance are long for use at 145 Mhz.\n* As MikeJ\\-UK noted in a comment \\- if your transmitter is FM (frequency modulated) then you will probably not hear anything as the diode acts to \"recover\" or \"demodulate\" the amplitude variations in the carrier wave of an AM (amplitude signal).\n* Adding a tuned circuit at the frequency of interest \\- as seen in almost all crystal set designs you will see, is probably the single best improvement that you can make.\n* Clip leads of the sort you are using usually use crimp construction. They can be high resistance or open circuit or have a thin skim of oxidation at the wire to clip contact so that you need a certain level of current flow before they will conduct. \n\nSoldering the core of the circuit with short lengths of wire is far preferable.\n\nClip leads of the sort shown should **ALWAYS** be soldered at the wire to clip join. Failure to do this will give you many hours of harmless and unproductive fun. When I buy leads like this I put a loose knot in the wire and remove it once the lead has been soldered.\n* The diode **MAY** be a 1N34a. That's a Germanium small signal diode. Rare and not cheap. More usual would be a 1N4148 or 1N916\\. Most small glass diodes are probably OK. Do NOT use a low Voltage power diode.(1N400x family etc)\n* The \"rabbits ears\" antenna leg is OKish but a length of wire is just as good\n* Power outlet ground MAY be safe as safe and MAY kill you when you put the earpiece in your ear."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student builds a simple crystal radio set but can only hear a small click when transmitting at 145 MHz.

Thats it. \n\nXP and Scrum are development processes that follows those values. Both are \"just as agile\". The big difference between Scrum and XP is that **Scrum does not contain practices specifically for programming**, whereas XP has lots of them (TDD, continuous integration, pair programming)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between Agile, XP (Extreme Programming), and Scrum?\n\nA) Agile is a specific methodology, while XP and Scrum are general principles for software development.\nB) XP and Scrum are identical methodologies, with the only difference being the length of release cycles.\nC) Agile is a set of values and principles, while XP and Scrum are specific methodologies that adhere to Agile principles.\nD) Scrum focuses on programming practices, while XP is more concerned with project management aspects.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the relationship between Agile, XP, and Scrum as described in the documentation.

Install and/or update pip\n\nInstall pip for Python 2 with\n\n```\nsudo apt install python-pip\n\n```\n\nor for Python 3\n\n```\nsudo apt install python3-pip\n\n```\n\n(if you use Python 3, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in the rest of this guide). \n\n**Optional (but recommended):** Turn on bash autocomplete for pip\n\nRun\n\n```\npip completion --bash >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nand run `source ~/.bashrc` to enable.\n2. Install virtualenvwrapper\n\nBecause [we want to avoid `sudo pip`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/21055859/1439843) we install `virtualenvwrapper` locally (by default under `~/.local`) with:\n\n```\npip install --user virtualenvwrapper\n\n```\n\nand\n\n```\necho \"export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n3. Source virtualenvwrapper in `.bashrc`\n\n```\necho \"source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nSetup virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper:\n---------------------------------------\n\nFirst we export the `WORKON_HOME` variable which contains the directory in which our virtual environments are to be stored. Let's make this `~/.virtualenvs`\n\n```\nexport WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs\n\n```\n\nnow also create this directory\n\n```\nmkdir $WORKON_HOME\n\n```\n\nand put this export in our `~/.bashrc` file so this variable gets automatically defined\n\n```\necho \"export WORKON_HOME=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nWe can also add some [extra tricks](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tips.html) like the following, which makes sure that if `pip` creates an extra virtual environment, it is also placed in our `WORKON_HOME` directory:\n\n```\necho \"export PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc \n\n```\n\n**Source \\~/.bashrc to load the changes**\n\n```\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\n**Test if it works**\n\nNow we create our first virtual environment. The `-p` argument is optional, it is used to set the Python version to use; it can also be `python3` for example.\n\n```\nmkvirtualenv -p python2.7 test\n\n```\n\nYou will see that the environment will be set up, and your prompt now includes the name of your active environment in parentheses. Also if you now run\n\n```\npython -c \"import sys; print sys.path\"\n\n```\n\nyou should see a lot of `/home/user/.virtualenv/...` because it now doesn't use your system site\\-packages.\n\nYou can deactivate your environment by running\n\n```\ndeactivate\n\n```\n\nand if you want to work on it again, simply type\n\n```\nworkon test\n\n```\n\nFinally, if you want to delete your environment, type\n\n```\nrmvirtualenv test\n\n```\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\n---\n\nThanks to the author of [this blogpost](http://web.archive.org/web/20160403233119/http://conjurecode.com/python-environment-for-ubuntu-part-1/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're setting up a Python development environment on Ubuntu and want to use virtual environments.

It installs pip for Python 3, uses pip to install virtualenvwrapper locally (avoiding sudo), sets the correct Python interpreter, adds the necessary lines to .bashrc to source virtualenvwrapper and set the WORKON_HOME directory, creates the directory for virtual environments, and finally sources .bashrc to apply the changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the system package manager to install virtualenvwrapper, which may not always have the latest version and doesn't allow for user-specific installation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it uses pip without specifying Python 3, potentially installing for Python 2, and the path to virtualenvwrapper.sh is incorrect.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it creates a specific virtual environment and installs virtualenvwrapper within it, rather than setting up virtualenvwrapper for system-wide use across multiple projects."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/27", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1801940", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/262294/"], "docs_id": 1801940, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a system of second\\-order differential equations that I want to decouple. they are,\n\n$\\\\ddot{x} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} x \\+ \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\dot{y}$\n\nand\n\n$\\\\ddot{y} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} y \\- \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\dot{x}$\n\nI am thinking that I should use some transformation, but it just isn't clear in my head yet!\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Differentiate the first wrt $t$ to gain an expression for $\\\\ddot y$:\n\n$\\\\dddot{x} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\dot x \\+ \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\ddot{y}$\n\nSubstitute $\\\\ddot{y} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} y \\- \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\dot{x}$ to get:\n\n$\\\\dddot{x} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\dot x \\+ \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2 \\\\omega\\_2}{2} y \\- \\\\omega\\_2^2 \\\\dot{x}$\n\nRearrange: $\\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2 \\\\omega\\_2}{2} y \\=\\\\dddot{x} \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\dot x \\+ \\\\omega\\_2^2 \\\\dot{x}$\n\nDifferentiate: $\\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2 \\\\omega\\_2}{2} \\\\dot y \\=\\\\ddddot{x} \\+ \\\\frac{2\\\\omega\\_2^2 \\-\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\ddot x$\n\nRecall that $\\\\ddot{x} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} x \\+ \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\dot{y} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\omega\\_2 \\\\dot{y}\\=\\\\ddot{x} \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} x$\n\nThus: $\\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\left (\\\\ddot{x} \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} x \\\\right ) \\=\\\\ddddot{x} \\+ \\\\frac{2\\\\omega\\_2^2 \\-\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\ddot x$\n\n... which becomes $\\\\ddddot{x} \\+ \\\\frac{2\\\\omega\\_2^2 \\-\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\ddot x \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} \\\\left (\\\\ddot{x} \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^2}{2} x \\\\right )\\=0 $\n\nor $\\\\ddddot{x} \\+ \\\\left(\\\\omega\\_2^2 \\-\\\\omega\\_1^2 \\\\right ) \\\\ddot x \\- \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_1^4}{2}x \\=0 $\n\nAuxiliary equation $\\\\lambda^4\\+p\\\\lambda^2\\-q\\=0$ where $p\\=\\\\left(\\\\omega\\_2^2 \\-\\\\omega\\_1^2 \\\\right )$ and $q\\=\\\\omega\\_1^4$\n\n$\\\\lambda^2\\={\\-p\\+\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}$ or $\\\\lambda^2\\={\\-p\\-\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}$\n\n$\\\\lambda\\_1\\=\\\\sqrt{{\\-p\\+\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}}$\n\n$\\\\lambda\\_2\\=\\-\\\\sqrt{{\\-p\\+\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}}$\n\n$\\\\lambda\\_3\\=\\\\sqrt{{\\-p\\-\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}}$\n\n$\\\\lambda\\_4\\=\\-\\\\sqrt{{\\-p\\-\\\\sqrt{p^2\\+4q} \\\\over 2}}$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the system of second-order differential equations:\n\n$\\ddot{x} = \\frac{\\omega_1^2}{2} x + \\omega_2 \\dot{y}$\n$\\ddot{y} = \\frac{\\omega_1^2}{2} y - \\omega_2 \\dot{x}$\n\nWhat is the correct form of the decoupled fourth-order differential equation for x?\n\nA) $\\ddddot{x} + (\\omega_2^2 +\\omega_1^2) \\ddot x + \\frac{\\omega_1^4}{2}x = 0$\n\nB) $\\ddddot{x} + (\\omega_2^2 -\\omega_1^2) \\ddot x - \\frac{\\omega_1^4}{4}x = 0$\n\nC) $\\ddddot{x} + (\\omega_2^2 -\\omega_1^2) \\ddot x - \\frac{\\omega_1^4}{2}x = 0$\n\nD) $\\ddddot{x} - (\\omega_2^2 +\\omega_1^2) \\ddot x + \\frac{\\omega_1^4}{2}x = 0$\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct decoupled equation is $\\ddddot{x} + (\\omega_2^2 -\\omega_1^2) \\ddot x - \\frac{\\omega_1^4}{2}x = 0$.

The final form shows that the equation depends only on x and its derivatives up to the fourth order, effectively decoupling it from y."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/28", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/570467", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/185637/"], "docs_id": 570467, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using Linux Virtual Machines (Wheezy, Linux Vserver), each with a desktop environment including Firefox. \n\nIf a Virtual Machine where to be compromised (e.g., *SQL injection*) so the kernel is hacked and control has been seized of the VM (not the host), it is possible to rebuild the VM, and move the data over to the rebuilt VM to fix the problem. \n\nQ: This may be a dumb question, but is it possible instead as an alternative to copy some files into the compromised VM (e.g., a clean version of everything in the `/boot` partition)?
