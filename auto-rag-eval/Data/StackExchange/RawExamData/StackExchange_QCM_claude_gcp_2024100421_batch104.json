By converting the KML to a shapefile in a projection that uses meters (like UTM), you ensure that the length calculation will be in a meaningful unit. The $length variable in QGIS can then automatically calculate the true length of the line, accounting for the Earth's curvature, which is more accurate than manual measurements or estimations.

I can figure out the centre of Normal Reaction but not how it's distributed over the surface.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to consider the elastic properties of the contact to determine the distribution of forces. Actually, it is the distribution of pressure you are interested, since you sum up the pressures to get force, and sum of the moment of pressure to get torque. Imagine a contact area with the center is on the contact point, the *z*\\-axis normal to the contact, and the *xy* plane along the contact.\n\n$$ \\\\begin{aligned}\n F\\_z \\& \\= \\\\int P(x,y) \\\\, {\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_x \\& \\= \\\\int (\\-y) P(x,y) \\\\,{\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_y \\& \\= \\\\int (\\+x) P(x,y)\\\\, {\\\\rm d} A\n\\\\end{aligned} $$\n\nSo given a pressure distribution $P(x,y)$ you can find the forces, but how to get the pressure distribution? \n\nThe most basic example is an object pushing on a flat plane. Consider the case where there is a known overlap amount $a(x,y)$ as a function of location on the contact\n\n![overlap](https://i.imgur.com/FDcm2Lc.png)\n\nAs a result, the surface of the object (red curve) must deform by $\\\\delta(x,y)$ in order to conform to the overlap. Surface pressure (yellow curve) must be applied to the object to do this\n\n![pressure](https://i.imgur.com/BQHR15q.png)\n\nThe pressure deflection relationship was developed by [Boussinesq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Point_contact_on_a_(3D)_half-space) and it looks like this\n\n$$ \\\\delta(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{1\\-\\\\nu^2}{\\\\pi E} \\\\iint \\\\frac{P(u,v)}{r} {\\\\rm d} A $$ \n\nwhere $r\\=\\\\sqrt{(x\\-u)^2\\+(y\\-v)^2}$ and $\\\\nu$ is the [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio) of the material and $E$ is the [Elastic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus).\n\nA special case for the above is the [Hertzian contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Classical_solutions_for_non-adhesive_elastic_contact) which deals with a sphere on a plane, sphere on a sphere, cylinder on a cylinder (2D contact) and general football shape (two radii) contact.\n\nThe general case can only be treated numerically with the contact are divided into a grid and a giant system of equations is developed of the form $\\\\delta\\_i \\= C\\_{i j} P\\_j$ (Hartnett solution).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Assume a certain amount of overlap $a(x,y)$ derived from the maximum penetration amount.\n2. Set the deflections equal to the overlap, and solve for the pressures $P(x,y)$.\n3. Calculate the total load and moments, and adjust the overlap accordingly. If the total load is less than the applied load then increase the overlap, and if the total moment is less than the applied torque then tilt the object\n4.

And assume that the point $O'$ represents the point of intersection of the axis of rotation of the telescope and the plane of the table.

However, if there's a slight misalignment, the readings from the two verniers will differ by an amount other than 180\u00b0. By taking the average of these two readings, systematic errors due to this misalignment can be minimized.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while verniers do increase precision, having two of them 180\u00b0 apart is not primarily for this purpose.

The ground wire leading to the switch was raw copper without any insulation.\n\nAfter replacing the switch, and turning on the circuit breaker, the breaker sparked and tripped. I'm thinking one of two things explain why:\n\n1. The new FEIT switch was defective (which would be my 4th defective switch from the big carton of FEIT switches I bought).\n2. The naked ground wire touched the contacts of the other switch in the box.\n\nI turned off the breaker, put it a completely different switch, and did my best to get that naked ground wire as far away as possible from the other switch. Then I flipped the breaker on (shielding my eyes, and standing away from the breaker box), and everything worked.\n\nSo my question: Why are ground wires sometimes installed without any insulation? The cost of insulated wire is almost identical to that of non\\-insulated wire, so I tend to think cost is not the primary driver of this decision.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cost, mostly\n------------\n\nWhether your grounding conductors are bare, insulated, or not even a wire to begin with depends on what wiring method you are working with. NM, because it's made in large quantities, uses a bare grounding wire to save cost (likewise with UF and most SE cables, as those pennies add up at industrial scales). On the other hand, if your house is wired using armored cable (AC), there are no ground wires, because the metal cable armor serves as the ground with the aid of a thin \"bonding strip\" to prevent \"choking\" of fault currents caused by stray inductive interactions. That lack of grounding wires is also a notable feature of many installs done in metal conduit, as the *conduit itself* then becomes the grounding conductor.\n\nFurthermore, some wiring methods aren't uniform in how they handle this; it's legal (and occasionally required) to run a separate equipment grounding conductor in metal conduit, and in most (albeit not all!) cases, equipment grounding conductors inside conduits can be either bare or insulated. Likewise, metal\\-clad cable usually uses an insulated grounding conductor, but can sometimes be found with a bare grounding conductor, or in configurations where the armor is the grounding means."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about grounding conductors in residential electrical wiring is most accurate?\n\nA) Grounding conductors are always insulated to prevent accidental contact with other wires.\n\nB) The use of bare grounding conductors in NM cable is primarily driven by aesthetic considerations.\n\nC) Bare grounding conductors are commonly used in NM cable to reduce manufacturing costs at industrial scales.\n\nD) Metal conduit systems never require a separate grounding conductor as the conduit itself always serves this purpose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that NM (non-metallic) cable, which is commonly used in residential wiring, typically uses bare grounding conductors to save costs in large-scale production. This practice is driven by economic considerations at an industrial scale.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the information clearly indicates that bare (uninsulated) ground wires are common in some wiring methods.\n\nOption B is false as aesthetics are not mentioned as a factor in choosing bare vs. insulated ground wires.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while metal conduit can serve as a grounding conductor, the passage notes that it's sometimes legal and occasionally required to run a separate grounding conductor in metal conduit systems."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/04", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/213014", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/35936/"], "docs_id": 213014, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Intuitively it might be clear that differential geometry is a very applicable subject in engineering and industry.

In general, a person is better advised to learn how to conduct performance benchmarking ***properly*** before asking such a question.\n\nIf your \"keys\" exclusively consist of consecutive integers, you can use an integer array. Zero\\-based consecutive integers can be used as array index as\\-is. Non\\-zero\\-based consecutive integers may require an index value adjustment before using it with an array.\n\nEven if the keys are not strictly consecutive, in that there are a small amount of holes (unused integer values between the minimum and maximum keys), it might still be beneficial performance\\-wise to use an array. \n\nRemember that using an array makes your code fragile (more easily broken) to changes. Therefore, carefully analyze your project's current and future needs, and document the limitations inside your code comments, or somehow make them obvious to your project's users.\n\nIf there is some magic mathematical functions that map your integer keys into your lookup values, test to see whether that will be faster. \n\nIf your dictionary is constructed incrementally (adding keys one by one), consider using the `Dictionary` constructor with the size preallocation option, with an estimate of the maximum size needed. This reduces the time spent in reallocating and rehashing.\n\nAs pointed out in others' comments, you can benchmark with [`SortedDictionary` (docs)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7fta44c(v=vs.110).aspx), which is typically, but not guaranteed to be a binary search tree.\n\nIf you know that the distribution of your integer keys may have unusual statistical distribution characteristics (for example, all of your keys are even\\-numbered, and so on), you may have to implement a workaround:\n\n* Depending on the `Dictionary` implementation, a workaround might not be necessary if it is already implemented from within.\n* Otherwise, you will need to apply a \"key diffusion / avalanche function\" to your integer keys, and use the modified key as a hash table index inside a typical \"modulo\\-N\" hash table.\n\t+ A typical good choice (for hash tables) is the MurmurHash3 function.\n\nA sorted int\\-int dictionary that is initialized up\\-front and never changed can be re\\-implemented as an array of integer pairs, and lookup can be performed with binary search.\n\nIf the int\\-int mapping comes from some mathematical functions that has monotonic trends, it might be possible to perform the table lookup faster than binary search."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a project that requires mapping integers to other integers, where both input and output are defined at runtime.

Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to improve performance, given that the developer only needs to define input-output pairs and access outputs with inputs, without the need for element removal or containment checks?\n\nA) Implement a custom hash table using the MurmurHash3 function for key diffusion\nB) Use a SortedDictionary<int,int> instead of a regular Dictionary<int,int>\nC) Create an integer array if the keys are consecutive or near-consecutive integers\nD) Implement a binary search tree from scratch to replace the Dictionary<int,int>\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Using an integer array is the most efficient solution for this specific scenario, especially if the keys are consecutive or near-consecutive integers. This approach offers the fastest access time and lowest memory overhead compared to the other options.\n\nOption A (implementing a custom hash table) is unnecessarily complex for this situation and may not provide significant performance improvements over the built-in Dictionary.\n\nOption B (using SortedDictionary) might offer some benefits, but it's generally not as fast as a simple array for integer keys.\n\nOption D (implementing a binary search tree) is also more complex than necessary and likely wouldn't outperform a simple array for integer keys.\n\nThe array solution is simple, memory-efficient, and provides O(1) access time, making it ideal for the described use case where only input-output pair definition and access are required."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/08", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16254", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/8803/"], "docs_id": 16254, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to recover the ext4 partition table of a 2TB disk, where I have 900\\.000 files.

In a discussion a colleague told me about a special forcing by Solovay which begins with a countable transitive model of $ZFC$ and reaches to an \"uncountable\" transitive generic model. My question is about these kind of special forcings and their possible special uses.\n\n**Question:** Please introduce a reference about any use of forcing with at least one of the below characteristics:\n\n**(a)** The ground model is uncountable.\n\n**(b)** The ground model is not transitive.\n\n**(c)** The generic model is uncountable.\n\n**(d)** The generic model is not transitive.\n\n**(e)** The generic model has more ordinals than ground model. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't agree that the \"usual\" use of forcing uses only countable transitive models. Perhaps this used to be true, years ago, and forcing is sometimes still taught this way now, because it is somewhat easier to see where the generic filters come from, but neither hypothesis is actually needed to develop a full theory of forcing, and I think that these days it is quite common to understand forcing as an internal ZFC construction that works over any model, not just the countable transitive models.\n\nFor example, the Boolean\\-value approach to forcing allows us to make sense of forcing over the universe, within ZFC. One defines the Boolean values $\\[\\\\!\\[\\\\varphi]\\\\!]$ for any formula $\\\\varphi$ in the forcing language, by induction on $\\\\varphi$. This allows one to speak of which statements are forceable or not over any model of set theory, and suffices for the consistency proofs. \n\nMeanwhile, one can turn the Boolean\\-valued model $V^{\\\\mathbb{B}}$ into an actual classical 2\\-valued model simply by taking the quotient by an ultrafilter $U\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{B}$, and there is no need for $U$ to be $V$\\-generic in this process, and even $U\\\\in V$ is completely fine. The elements of the quotient are the equivalence classes with respect to the relation $\\\\sigma\\\\sim\\_U\\\\tau\\\\iff \\[\\\\!\\[\\\\sigma\\=\\\\tau]\\\\!]\\\\in U$. This is not the same as the usual value $\\\\text{val}(\\\\sigma,U)$ assignment, except when $U$ is $V$\\-generic. This gives rise to the Boolean ultrapower map $j:V\\\\to \\\\check V\\_U$, defined by $j:x\\\\mapsto \\[\\\\check x]\\_U$, which is an elementary embedding of $V$ into the class model $\\\\check V\\_U$, and $\\\\check V\\_U$ has its forcing extension $\\\\check V\\_U\\[G]$ as a class inside $V$. The generic object $G$ is simply the equivalence class of the *name* of the generic object $G\\=\\[\\\\dot G]\\_U$. Thus, one never needs to leave $V$ to speak of the forcing extensions of $V$. When there are large cardinals, one can even arrange that $\\\\check V\\_U$ is transitive, and these Boolean ultrapowers can be viewed as large cardinal embeddings. \n\nDan Seabold and I give a fairly thorough account of the Boolean ultrapower in our paper [Boolean ultrapowers as large cardinal embeddings](http://jdh.hamkins.org/boolean-ultrapowers/). In particular, this paper contains examples of all of the types of examples you request. \n\n**Update.** Here is an example that may be more like what you had wanted. \n\n**Theorem.** If there is a supercompact cardinal, then there is transitive inner model, containing all ordinals, with a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. Similarly, there is an inner model with a supercompact cardinal $\\\\kappa$ for which $2^\\\\kappa\\=\\\\kappa^\\+$ and another with a supercompact cardinal $\\\\kappa$ for which $2^\\\\kappa\\>\\\\kappa^\\+$. \n\nProof. These results and others like it appear in [A. Apter, V. Gitman, J. D. Hamkins, \u201cInner models with large cardinal features usually obtained by forcing,\u201d Archive for Mathematical Logic, 51(2012\\):257\\-283](http://jdh.hamkins.org/innermodelswithlargecardinals/). Suppose that $\\\\kappa$ is supercompact in $V$. Let $j:V\\\\to M$ be a $\\\\theta$\\-supercompactness embedding for some $\\\\theta$ for which $2^{\\\\theta^{\\\\lt\\\\kappa}}\\=\\\\theta^\\+$. (This is possible because the SCH holds above any supercompact cardinal.) Let $\\\\mathbb{P}$ be the Laver preparation forcing for $j(\\\\kappa)$ as defined in $M$, but starting above $\\\\theta$. Thus, $\\\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\\\leq\\\\theta$\\-closed in $M$ and hence also in $V$, and by counting we can see that there are only $\\\\theta^\\+$ many dense subsets of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ in $V$. So in $V$ we may construct an $M$\\-generic filter $G\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}$. Thus, $M\\[G]$ is a transitive inner model of $V$ in which $j(\\\\kappa)$ is a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. By also combining $\\\\mathbb{P}$ with further forcing, we can ensure that the GCH holds or fails at $j(\\\\kappa)$, or a variety of other situations. QED\n\nThe general theorem here is the following, where a partial order $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\\\lt\\\\kappa$\\-friendly, if for every $\\\\delta\\\\lt\\\\kappa$, there is a condition below which $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ adds no new subsets to $\\\\delta$. \n\n**Theorem.**(Seabold, Hamkins) If $\\\\kappa$ is strongly compact, then for any $\\\\lt\\\\kappa$\\-friendly notion of forcing, there is a transitive inner model satisfying every sentence forced by $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ over $V$. \n\nThe proof uses Boolean ultrapowers, and the point is that strong compactness is enough to enable one to find a well\\-founded Boolean ultrapower."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about forcing in set theory is NOT correct according to the information provided?\n\nA) Forcing can be applied to uncountable models of ZFC using the Boolean-value approach.\n\nB) The Boolean ultrapower technique allows for the construction of forcing extensions without leaving the original model V.\n\nC) Forcing always requires a countable transitive ground model to produce a valid generic extension.\n\nD) It's possible to create a transitive inner model with a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal using forcing, given the existence of a supercompact cardinal in the ground model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the text explicitly states that the \"usual\" use of forcing does not require countable transitive models, contrary to what some might believe.

It uses the `with_variable` function to calculate the azimuth once and then uses a `case` statement to assign quadrant numbers based on specific azimuth ranges. This approach accounts for the diagonal nature of the quadrants (10\u00b0-80\u00b0, 100\u00b0-170\u00b0, etc.) as shown in the original diagram. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses simple 90-degree quadrants which don't match the required diagonal quadrants. Option C is incorrect as it doesn't provide the correct quadrant numbering and doesn't account for the diagonal nature of the quadrants. Option D is incorrect because it divides the azimuth into equal 90-degree segments, which doesn't match the required diagonal quadrants."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/25", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/103212", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/32299/"], "docs_id": 103212, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found this relation in OpenStreetMap\n\n<http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1561932>\n\n[http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0\\.6/relation/1561932/full](http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/1561932/full)\n\nIt has only one outer member but it needs the other members to be a valid multipolygon.

In that sense, it may well be the case that Odersky wanted type classes, but did not want to introduce a mechanism to handle that exclusively, and, therefore, came up with something else that let him remove one concept (Views) and replace it with a more generic concept that handles both views and type classes.\n\nIn case anyone is interested, Poor Man's Type Classes, referred to by Brian back at Stack Overflow, is dated 2006 as well.

However, if you start at a certain value of comoving coordinates (say on $S^3$), it turns out that there is no time\\-like or null geodesic that returns to your starting point. The easiest way to see this is through a Penrose diagram for de Sitter. \n\nThe Penrose diagram for de Sitter is shown below: (from [Les Houches 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110007))\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)\n\nPenrose diagrams encode the causal structure of spacetime. Every point in de Sitter corresponds to a point in the above square, and diagonal lines at $45^\\\\circ$ angles correspond to the world\\-lines of null geodesics or light rays. Two light rays are shown above, going from the line $I^\\-$ to $I^\\+$. The 'North Pole' and 'South Pole' are antipodal points on $S^3$, while $I^\\+$ and $I^\\-$ correspond to points at the infinite future and infinite past (if you want, you can think of these as equivalence classes of time\\-like geodesics). Hence, a ray of light has 'just enough time' in the lifetime of a de Sitter universe to travel from $\\\\theta\\=0$ to $\\\\theta\\=\\\\pi$, and can't get back to its original comoving position at $\\\\theta\\=0$. In fact, it's clear that any two time\\-like geodesics that attempt to go around $S^3$ will intersect at most once."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In de Sitter space, which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of geodesics and the possibility of orbits?\n\nA) Time-like geodesics can form stable orbits around fixed points in de Sitter space due to its constant positive curvature.\n\nB) Light rays (null geodesics) can complete a full orbit around the 3-sphere cross-section of de Sitter space and return to their starting point.\n\nC) The Penrose diagram of de Sitter space shows that light rays have just enough time to travel from one pole of the 3-sphere to the opposite pole, but not back to the original position.\n\nD) The constant positive curvature of de Sitter space allows for multiple intersections between any two time-like geodesics attempting to go around the 3-sphere.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The Penrose diagram for de Sitter space demonstrates that light rays (null geodesics) have just enough time in the lifetime of a de Sitter universe to travel from one pole (\u03b8=0) to the opposite pole (\u03b8=\u03c0) of the 3-sphere cross-section, but cannot return to their original position. This precludes the possibility of complete orbits for both null and time-like geodesics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because stable orbits are not possible for time-like geodesics in de Sitter space. \n\nOption B is wrong as the documentation clearly states that light rays cannot complete a full orbit and return to their starting point.\n\nOption D is false because the Penrose diagram shows that any two time-like geodesics attempting to go around the 3-sphere will intersect at most once, not multiple times."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/10/15", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/325095", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/57384/"], "docs_id": 325095, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Language is like a living organism: it grows and changes and, once in a while, changes so drastically that we are confused.\n\nSo, I've read [a detailed explanation](https://strategiesforparents.com/is-it-correct-to-say-thanks-for-the-invite/) of how and when to use the expression \"Thanks for the invite,\" but I haven't found any explanation of whether I can use \"Thank you for the invite.\"\n\nHere's the situation I would like to discuss:\n\nI've been contacted by the recruiter and invited for a behavioral interview.

You could make \"Thank you for the invitation\" less formal by saying, \"Thanks very much for the invitation.\"\n\nBut \"Thank you\" doesn't sound formal! It can be said with various tones of voice. It can express profound and sincere gratitude but it can also be offhand and perfunctory. When I get off the local bus I quite often say \"Thank you\" to the driver.

However, after calculating angular distortion, I have realized that it is actually not conformal.\n\nHow should I classify these projections, whose Tissot's indicatrices are perfect circles but the angular distortion is not zero (omega \\<\\> 0\\)?\n\n---\n\nI didn't name the projections above since none of them have yet been published, so their names are not meaningful yet. The first paper should probably be published next month, so I need to reassure that certain statements are correct before final publishing. \n\nOne of the projections is a spherical cube map projection used in Outerra engine, provided through the courtesy of Brano Kemen. The distribution of the texel aspect distortion can be seen in the paper Ellipsoidal Clipmaps. The texel aspect distortion is defined as the texel (a pixel in the texture space) width to height ratio after unprojecting to the surface of a planet. The distribution of texel aspect distortion and how the front face of the cube (actually a projection plane) looks like for the OSC is shown in the subfigure c) on the figures [Err1](https://sites.google.com/site/opengltutorialsbyaks/events/sc10/Err1.jpg) and [SC10](https://sites.google.com/site/opengltutorialsbyaks/events/sc10/SC10.jpg), respectively. I planned to give more links, but my reputation on this site (as a beginner) prevents me from doing so.\n\nFor everything I mention here, I'm using my own implementation. It is more flexible and for, at least, the order of magnitude faster than using any standard library (like Proj.4\\). Also, as I'm experimenting with the projections, using a standard library can be a limiting factor.\n\nIn the posted figures, I used the inverse projection of the elementary cells in the projected image and reprojected them to the surface of the Earth. After that, I measured the distance on the surface of the Earth along X and Y axis in the projection space. Here is the code that produces the aspect distortion metric:\n\n```\ndouble phi1, theta1, phi2, theta2;\ninverse(x - delta, y, 0, phi1, theta1, false);\ninverse(x + delta, y, 0, phi2, theta2, false);\ndouble dLon = SphericalDistance2(phi1, theta1, phi2, theta2);\n\ninverse(x, y - delta, 0, phi1, theta1, false);\ninverse(x, y + delta, 0, phi2, theta2, false);\ndouble dLat = SphericalDistance2(phi1, theta1, phi2, theta2);\n\ndouble aspectDist = dLon / dLat;\n\n```\n\nThe \"inverse\" function transforms projected (x,y) coordinates back to the surface of the planet (phi, theta). The last parameter defined whether an ellipsoidal model should be used. In the previous code, I'm using a spherical model, so the distance is measured on the spherical surface.\n\nThe problem is that the texel aspect distortion does not exist for the OSC but the angular distortion is not zero. I need to know how to reference such behavior of the projection. I thought it was conformity, but now I see that it is not. However, that property is very useful since causes no anisotropy in mapping projected image back to the surface of the planet. Or I made a terrible mistake.\n\nFor the angular distortion I'm using formulae from the Snyder\u2019s \"Map Projections \u2013 A Working Manuel\" (pg.24, eq.4\\-10 through 4\\-14\\). Instead of partial derivatives, I'm using finite (symmetrical) differences in extremely small distances (\\~1e\\-10\\).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How do you calculate angular distortion, exactly?

Conformality means that angles are preserved locally at each point, but not necessarily between arbitrary lines on the projected surface. The non-zero angular distortion calculation is likely due to measuring angles between projected straight lines, which don't correspond to great circles on the globe. The uniform texel aspect distortion further supports the projection's conformal nature. Option C is incorrect because conformality doesn't guarantee angle preservation between arbitrary straight lines on the projection. Option D introduces a non-standard term.

Very simple question: why is it called a law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> **Why do they call the power law distribution a 'law'**\n\nIn the specific case of \"power law\" the term \"power law\" is a term in science. It refers to a connection between two phenomena that have a relationship that goes as a power, $y \\\\propto x^\\\\alpha$.\n\ne.g. see this page (from Harvey Mudd College's physics dept) on [Power Law](http://www.physics.hmc.edu/analysis/power.php):\n\n> When one quantity (say y) depends on another (say x) raised to some power, we say that y is described by a power law.\n\nAlso see the Wikipedia article on [Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)\n\nThat sense of *law* similar to the use of the word for many other physical laws.\n\nThis descriptor (\"power law\") is often applied when it's the probability density of some quantity (or in discrete cases, the pmf) that has that property, $f(x) \\\\propto x^\\\\alpha$; whence \"power law distribution\".\n\nThese \"power law\" phenomena crop up a lot ... though perhaps not nearly as often as they're claimed. See A. Clauset, C.R. Shalizi, and M.E.J. Newman (2009\\), \"*Power\\-law distributions in empirical data*\" SIAM Review 51(4\\), 661\\-703\n(arxiv [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062)) and Shalizi's *So You Think You Have a Power Law \u2014 Well Isn't That Special?* (see [here](http://bactra.org/weblog/491.html)).\n\n> **Power law distribution is a distribution not a law.**\n\nHere the term \"law\" goes with \"power\" (the distribution whose density follows a \"power\\-law\") rather than distribution, but actually, in statistics, the term \"law\" was frequently used (and to a lesser extent, still is) simply as a term for *distribution*.\n\nThis is closely related to the meaning of the term \"law\" in science (the effect that some particular phenomenon always occurs if specific conditions hold). \\[There's also likely some connection to the use of the word law in mathematics, as a kind of mathematical rule.]\n\nSo for example, under certain conditions, you'd expect quantities to have something like a normal distribution (measured quantities with lots of small errors adding together, the conditions for the \"normal law\"), and under other conditions you'd expect quantities to have something like a Poisson distribution (counting rare events happening at constant rate, independently, the conditions for the \"Poisson law\")\n\nSo you can readily find references to \"normal law\", \"Poisson law\" (sometimes \"the law of small numbers\" or \"the law of rare events\") and so on.\n\ne.g.\n\n1. see the end of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Extensions) of the Wikipedia article on the normal distribution:\n\n> * Pearson distribution\u2014 a four\\-parametric family of probability distributions that extend **the normal law** to include different skewness and kurtosis values.\n2. In the [Notes section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Notes) of the Wikipedia article on the Poisson distribution:\n\n> 17. Raikov, D. (1937\\). On the decomposition of **Poisson laws**. Comptes Rendus (Doklady) de l' Academie des Sciences de l'URSS, 14, 9\u201311\\. (The proof is also given in von Mises, Richard (1964\\). Mathematical Theory of Probability and Statistics. New York: Academic Press.)\n3. Same article, see the end of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Law_of_rare_events):\n\n> The word law is sometimes used as a synonym of probability distribution, and convergence in law means convergence in distribution. Accordingly, the Poisson distribution is sometimes called the law of small numbers because it is the probability distribution of the number of occurrences of an event that happens rarely but has very many opportunities to happen.\n\n(emphases mine)\n\nSo \"law\" can mean \"distribution\", but in the phrase \"power law distribution\" it doesn't, since \"distribution\" already takes that role (as mentioned earlier, it's the distribution that has a \"power\\-law\" in the scientific sense). However, when the phrase \"power law\" without the word \"distribution\" is nevertheless referring to a distribution, it *can* be taken to carry that meaning, as for example, in the title of Shalizi's blog item above \"So You Think You Have a Power Law\" (clearly one wouldn't say \"Power\\-law Law\" in that case, since the first \"law\" can convey the entire sense on its own)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the term \"power law\" is most accurate?\n\nA) The term \"law\" in \"power law distribution\" refers to the distribution itself, similar to how \"law\" is sometimes used as a synonym for probability distribution.\n\nB) A power law relationship always implies a power law distribution, and the terms are interchangeable in scientific literature.\n\nC) The \"law\" in \"power law\" refers to a scientific relationship where one quantity depends on another raised to some power, and this concept is applied to describe certain probability distributions.\n\nD) Power law distributions are always accurately identified in empirical data, justifying their widespread claim in various fields.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately describes the origin and application of the term \"power law.\" In science, a power law refers to a relationship where one quantity (y) depends on another (x) raised to some power, expressed as y \u221d x^\u03b1.

Web Application and Rich Internet Application are one and the same thing.\n\nMake it simple...\n\n* A Website is a set of pages (static or dynamic) and is fairly simple to build and maintain.\n* A more complex and feature rich manifestation of the same website which includes technologies/paradigms/practices that **evolved** in the last 5 years is what they call a Web Application.\n\n\t+ Technologies: JavaScript, REST, Social Web, APIs, improved standards, NoSQL, Clouds, etc.\n\t+ Paradigms: Ajax, perceived responsiveness, UX, mashups, etc.\n\t+ Practices: accessibility, multiple devices, etc.\n\nSo, Gmail is NOT the regular thing, it is one of THE most successful Web Applications (or RIA if you will).\n\nNext, to answer you original question...\n\nCreating a *Desktop\\-cum\\-Web* application is a non\\-trivial task.

Holding out the entire last year (2021) as the test set offers several advantages:\n\n1. It allows for a substantial training set (2018-2020), providing more data for model fitting.\n2. It accounts for seasonality by including a full year in the test set, enabling analysis of performance across different seasons.\n3. It evaluates the model's performance during the recovery period (2021), which is crucial for understanding how well the model adapts to post-pandemic trends.\n4. It aligns with the recommendation in the StackExchange answer to use the last year as a test set for sales data with seasonality.\n\nOption A is less suitable because a fixed 80-20 split might not properly account for seasonality and could mix pre-pandemic and pandemic-affected data in both sets.

In (2\\), it's integral.\nIf you want to use an ordering where \"you can come along\" appears at the end, then whether you should use (3\\) or (4\\) depends on whether you mean something equivalent to (1\\) or something equivalent to (2\\).

It follows Magento's best practices for extending functionality without modifying core files.\n2. Creating a new block class allows for proper encapsulation of the dropdown logic.\n3. Using XML layout updates is the standard way to add new elements to existing pages in Magento 2.\n4.

The output you show is from the profiler, and the way this works is that at some point in the code execution you call `Varien_Profiler::start()` then at a later point you call `Varien_Profiler::stop()`. The profiler then tells you in the output which displays below the main site HTML how long that section of code took to execute according to the argument you send to the `start()` and `stop()` methods which acts as an identifier in the profiler output. You can also see other information such as the number of times the code in question was executed and the amount of memory allocated to PHP to execute the code.\n\nSo if you look at one example you have posted, `mage::dispatch::routers_match`. The call to start and stop the profiler happens in class `Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Front` and method `dispatch()`:\n\n```\npublic function dispatch()\n{\n    ...\n\n    Varien_Profiler::start('mage::dispatch::routers_match'); ////// profiler started here\n    $i = 0;\n    while (!$request->isDispatched() && $i++ < 100) {\n        foreach ($this->_routers as $router) {\n            /** @var $router Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Abstract */\n            if ($router->match($request)) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    Varien_Profiler::stop('mage::dispatch::routers_match'); ////// profiler stopped here\n\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nAs you can see from the above, optimising that section of code is not going to be straightforward \\- if you follow the methods which run there is a lot of code which runs here. Also the reality is that what you have found in your profiler output is the time it takes for the framework to be initialised and then the request to run through the action methods code. These processes are extremely in depth and optimising them would require delving into the most complex workings of Magento framework with an end result of little to no improvement in speed, and probably a broken store unless you knew exactly what you were doing.\n\nThe bottom line is that Magento is a heavy configuration based MVC framework which requires a large number of resources to be collected and used for every request \\- and this just takes time. That's the down side, but the up side is that in return we get to work with a hugely capable piece of software which is intuitive to develop (once you know it well) and with which you can achieve anything you want \\- hence the huge number of extensions available.\n\nSo there are basically 2 things which take time with Magento, initialising the framework, and building the response, and these things can't realistically be optimised in code terms. These are pretty much the 2 areas you have found and so in order to improve their performance you need to be looking at your server hardware, being your hosting, as opposed to the codebase."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the profiler output and explanation provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding optimizing Magento's performance?\n\nA) The best approach is to modify the core files associated with each profiler output to reduce execution time.\n\nB) Focusing on optimizing the 'mage::dispatch::routers_match' section of code will yield significant performance improvements.\n\nC) The primary method for improving performance is to upgrade the server hardware and hosting environment.\n\nD) Adding more calls to Varien_Profiler::start() and Varien_Profiler::stop() throughout the codebase will automatically optimize performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that the profiler output represents core Magento framework processes that are complex and not easily optimized through code changes. Attempting to modify these core processes (option A) could break the store and is not recommended. Focusing on just the 'mage::dispatch::routers_match' section (option B) won't yield significant improvements as it's part of the larger framework initialization. Adding more profiler calls (option D) only measures performance and doesn't improve it. The documentation suggests that the most effective way to improve performance is by upgrading server hardware and the hosting environment, as Magento is resource-intensive due to its configuration-based MVC framework."}}
