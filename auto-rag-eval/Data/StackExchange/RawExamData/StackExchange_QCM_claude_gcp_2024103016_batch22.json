With `mksh`, you get a syntax error. In the Bourne shell, it didn't work at all, even for scalar variables.\n\nAlso note that even with scalar variables, whether the variable ends up being *exported* within the function (that is, passed to commands being executed) varies from shell to shell (it is in bash, yash, mksh, zsh, but not in ksh, ash).\n\nIt only works the way you'd expect with `zsh`.

As explained in the documentation, a zero-cross SSR switches on every mains half-cycle anyway, regardless of the input PWM frequency. This means that concerns about SSR wear from different PWM frequencies are largely irrelevant. The SSR will always switch at the zero-crossing points of the AC waveform, which occurs twice per cycle (100 or 120 times per second, depending on whether it's 50 Hz or 60 Hz mains power). This feature helps reduce mains interference and is ideal for heating control applications. The other options are incorrect: A) The ESP8266 cannot reliably produce 1 Hz PWM according to the updated information.

These limitations vary between kernel versions and tend to get smaller. Please read information about particular filesystems.\n\nit does not actually say what might be supported (or in which kernel version, since that's mostly down to the inotify support in the filesystem itself rather than the library/utilities).\n\nA simple explanation is that is doesn't really make sense to support inotify for *everything* in in `/sys` (or `/proc`) since they don't get modified in the conventional sense. Most of these files/directories represent a snapshot of kernel state *at the time you view them*. \n\nThink of `/proc/uptime` as a simple example, it contains the uptime accurate to the centisecond. Should inotify notify you 100 times a second that it was \"written\" to? Apart from not being very useful, it would be both a performance issue and a tricky problem to solve since nothing is generating inotify events on behalf of these fictional \"writes\". Within the kernel inotify [works at the filesystem API level](https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/).\n\nThe situation then is that *some* things in sysfs and procfs do generate inotify events, `/proc/uptime` for example will tell you when it has been accessed (access, open, close), but on my kernel `/proc/mounts` shows no events at all when file systems are mounted and unmounted.\n\nHere's Greg Kroah\\-Hartman's take on it:\n\n[http://linux\\-fsdevel.vger.kernel.narkive.com/u0qmXPFK/inotify\\-sysfs](http://linux-fsdevel.vger.kernel.narkive.com/u0qmXPFK/inotify-sysfs)\nand Linus:\n\n[http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux\\-fsdevel/msg73955\\.html](http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fsdevel/msg73955.html)\n\n(both threads from 2014 however)\n\nTo solve your immediate problem you may be able to use dbus, e.g. `dbus-monitor --monitor --system` (no need to be root) will show trigger on tun devices being created and removed (though mine doesn't show the tun device name, only the HAL string with the PtP IP); `udevadm monitor` (no need to be root); or fall back to polling the directory (try: [script to monitor for new files in a shared folder (windows host, linux guest)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/305394/script-to-monitor-for-new-files-in-a-shared-folder-windows-host-linux-guest)).\n(With `udev` you could also use `inotifywait -m -r /dev/.udev` and watch out for files starting with \"n\", but that's quite an ungly hack.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using inotifywait to monitor directory creation events in the /sys filesystem, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) inotifywait will always work reliably for all directories under /sys, as long as they have world-readable permissions.\n\nB) inotifywait is guaranteed to work for all virtual filesystems like /sys and /proc without any limitations.\n\nC) inotifywait may have limited functionality when monitoring /sys directories due to how these virtual filesystems represent kernel state.\n\nD) inotifywait will never work for any directories under /sys, regardless of permissions or kernel version.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that while inotify (and by extension, inotifywait) can work with sysfs (/sys) and procfs (/proc), it comes with limitations. These virtual filesystems represent kernel state at the time of access, and not all changes generate conventional filesystem events that inotify can detect.

The `Order` would also have a method `AddOrderItem(Product product, int amount)` and the `Order` would check if there is already an `OrderLine` for that specific product.\n\nIn such a model you would also have objects that are not real entities, like a `Repository` for accessing data or a `Factory` for creating entities. These are called Domain Services. An Application Layer is responsible for calling the Domain Services (for example to retrieve an entity from the database) and then it will execute functionality on the entity. The `Application Layer` should be as thin as possible.\n\n[This is a nice article about DDD](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=97) which explains these concepts in more detail.\n\n* You can also use an *Anemic Domain Model*. That means that your entities consist of get/set properties and contain no behavior. In such a design, your Business Layer will contain the behavior, such as calculating the `Order` price and checking for duplicate `OrderLines`.\n\nThere are different opinions whether an Anemic Domain Model is a bad thing. *Personally* I prefer a real Domain Model.\n\n[This article](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html) describes the differences between an Anemic and non\\-Anemic Domain Model."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of software architecture, which of the following statements accurately describes the difference between a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach and an Anemic Domain Model?\n\nA) In DDD, entities contain only data, while in an Anemic Domain Model, entities contain both data and behavior.\n\nB) DDD promotes thin Application Layers, while Anemic Domain Models require thick Application Layers to handle business logic.\n\nC) In DDD, calculations like order total price are performed in the Business Layer, while in an Anemic Domain Model, these calculations are encapsulated within the entity itself.\n\nD) DDD incorporates behavior into domain entities, while an Anemic Domain Model separates data and behavior, keeping entities as simple data containers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), entities are rich with both data and behavior. For example, an Order entity would contain methods to calculate the total price or add order items, encapsulating business logic within the domain objects. This approach creates a more object-oriented and behavior-rich domain model.\n\nIn contrast, an Anemic Domain Model keeps entities as simple data containers with getters and setters, moving all business logic and behavior to separate service layers. This separation of data and behavior is the key characteristic of an Anemic Domain Model.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the characteristics of DDD and Anemic Domain Models. \n\nOption B, while partially true about DDD promoting thin Application Layers, doesn't accurately capture the key difference between the two approaches.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misrepresents where calculations are performed in both approaches.

If TeX finds a false `\\if..` clause it looks at all following tokens until it finds a token equal to `\\else` or `\\fi` *without* expanding macros. If it finds another `\\if..` conditional it increases an internal counter and will look for the `\\fi` for this conditional before looking for the outer one.\n\nIf you have a macro like `\\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi}` the `\\fi` is hidden and not found. The same is true for own `\\if..` macros inside a *false* clause. Both will work in a *true* clause because there macros are expanded as normal.\n\nTo make your macro work you need to use `\\let\\fistudenti\\fi` instead, which makes `\\fistudenti` a token identical to `\\fi`. This is also the way used by `\\newif` to define now conditionals. The `\\xxxtrue` and `\\xxxfalse` macros defined by it simply include `\\let\\ifxxx\\iftrue` or `\\let\\ifxxx\\iffalse`.\n\nFor further reading have a look at the Q\\&A [What is an \\\\if?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/12015/2975)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: In LaTeX, when defining a custom command to replace \\fi in conditional statements, which of the following approaches is correct and why?\n\nA) \\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi}\n\nB) \\let\\fistudenti\\fi\n\nC) \\def\\fistudenti{\\fi}\n\nD) \\newif\\iffistudenti\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B (\\let\\fistudenti\\fi) is the correct approach. The \\let command makes \\fistudenti a token identical to \\fi, which is necessary for TeX to properly process conditional statements.\n\nOption A (\\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi}) doesn't work because it hides the \\fi inside a macro. TeX needs to see \\fi directly when processing conditionals, especially in false clauses where it doesn't expand macros.\n\nOption C (\\def\\fistudenti{\\fi}) has the same issue as Option A, hiding \\fi inside a macro definition.\n\nOption D (\\newif\\iffistudenti) creates a new conditional rather than replacing \\fi, which doesn't address the original problem.\n\nThe key concept here is that TeX's conditional primitives (\\if, \\else, \\fi) must be directly visible to TeX and cannot be hidden inside macros for proper processing, especially in false clauses of conditional statements."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/21", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/365949", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/36296/"], "docs_id": 365949, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Inspired by the discussion on <https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues/388>\n\nThere are many questions on this site like \"I use theme X but I'd like to have the footer/header/whatever from theme Y\", just one example: [Mix Warsaw and Madrid beamer theme](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/346686/mix-warsaw-and-madrid-beamer-theme)\n\nTo make this easier, how could one just load a specific template from a theme, for example just the footline? \n\n---\n\nTest cases\n\n> Test 1: simple case\n\n```\n\\useoutertheme{infolines}\n\\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme] \n\n```\n\n> Test 2: test if it works with parent theme\n\n```\n\\usetheme{Boadilla} \n\\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme] \n\n```\n\n> Test 3: test if it works with options\n\n```\n\\usetheme[height=3cm]{Rochester}\n\\setbeamertemplate{headline}[sidebar theme]\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Test 1\n======\n\nThis seems to work.\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@footline{footline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@footline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\useoutertheme{infolines}\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nTest 2\n======\n\nIf you want to gain the control over colors, do the same trick on `\\beamer@clearbeamercolor` and `\\beamer@setbeamercolor`.\n\n(The same for `\\setbeamerfont` and `\\setbeamersize`)\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@footline{footline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@footline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\let\\beamer@clearbeamercolor@old=\\beamer@clearbeamercolor\n    \\let\\beamer@setbeamercolor@old=\\beamer@setbeamercolor\n    \\def\\beamer@clearbeamercolor#1#2{}\n    \\def\\beamer@setbeamercolor#1#2{}\n    \\usetheme{Boadilla}\n    \\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme]\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n    \\let\\beamer@clearbeamercolor=\\beamer@clearbeamercolor@old\n    \\let\\beamer@setbeamercolor=\\beamer@setbeamercolor@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nTest 3\n======\n\nIn this test, it is essential that `\\beamer@@@@sbto` is a long macro.\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@headline{headline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@headline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\usetheme[height=3cm]{Rochester}\n    \\setbeamertemplate{headline}[sidebar theme]\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\section{TEST}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a LaTeX Beamer presentation, you want to use the Boadilla theme but replace its footline with the one from the infolines theme.

Does it sound right to you?\nAlternatively, I could run the equation separately for the two groups but I obtain very similar results and the two groups are quite unbalanced..\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your current procedure seems right to me, but you could make it even simpler by considering:\n\n$$Y \\= \\\\gamma\\_1 X \\+ \\\\gamma\\_2 X \\* D\\_2 \\+ (...) $$\n\nAs you only have 2 groups, $\\\\gamma\\_2$ will be significantly positive only if the specific effect of X on Y is higher for group 2\\.\n\nPs: Note that you might also be interested to have in the equation group fixed\\-effect $T\\_1$ ?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An economist is studying the effect of a continuous treatment X (ranging from 0 to 1) on a dependent variable Y using experimental data. The sample consists of 250 individuals divided into two groups: 50 in Group 1 and 200 in Group 2. The researcher wants to test if the effect of X on Y varies between these groups. Which of the following models would be most appropriate and efficient for this analysis?\n\nA) Run separate regressions for each group: \n   Group 1: Y = \u03b20 + \u03b21X + \u03b5\n   Group 2: Y = \u03b10 + \u03b11X + \u03b5\n\nB) Y = \u03b20 + \u03b21X + \u03b22D + \u03b23(X*D) + \u03b5, where D is a dummy variable for Group 2\n\nC) Y = \u03b30 + \u03b31X + \u03b32(X*D2) + \u03b5, where D2 is a dummy variable for Group 2\n\nD) Y = \u03b40 + \u03b41X + \u03b42D + \u03b5, where D is a dummy variable for Group 2\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate and efficient model for this analysis. Here's why:\n\n1. It allows for testing the differential effect of X on Y between the two groups in a single regression.\n2. The coefficient \u03b32 directly represents the difference in the effect of X between Group 2 and Group 1.\n3. It's more parsimonious than option B, which includes an unnecessary main effect for the group dummy.\n4. Unlike option A, it doesn't require running separate regressions, which is especially beneficial given the unbalanced group sizes.\n5. Option D doesn't allow for testing the differential effect of X between groups.\n\nThis model provides a straightforward interpretation: \u03b31 represents the effect of X for Group 1, while (\u03b31 + \u03b32) represents the effect for Group 2. If \u03b32 is statistically significant, it indicates that the effect of X differs between the two groups."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/07", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/167194", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/64672/"], "docs_id": 167194, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to figure out how the system works and I was wondering.\n\nI already read about, [Under what conditions does Malthael drop legendary pieces or plans?](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/161771/under-what-conditions-does-malthael-drop-legendary-pieces-or-plans)\n\nWhen you first kill Malthael you have a guarantee drop (boots \\+ plan) and another one, if you reset your quest you will get another guarantee legendary.\n\nBut, reading a blue, the guarantee legendary comes if you complete all the quests before, is this true?

On my application there are classes that only care for the real output value (regardless if an error is present) and other classes that needs the real value and the proper error code.

If you were to use a `-65500` result as an code to indicate \"there has been error XYZ\" you are actually mixing two separate contexts: The normal result of `Sensor::compute()` and signaling errors. Imagine that \\- due to a change of requirements \\- `Sensor::compute()` suddendly should be able to return negative values... but those are now already reserved for your \"error codes\" \\- and suddently you've got a problem.\n\nAlso you need to sprinkle your code with calls along the line of\n\n```\nif (sensorValue == ERROR_CODE_ABC)\n    //Error handling\nelse if (sensorValue == ERROR_CODE_DEF)\n    //More Error handling\nelse\n    doStuffWithValue(sensorValue);\n\n```\n\nAnd you always risk the possibility of working with an errorCode value instead of a real value, because you missed a spot for a check (new target voltage for the PSU is \\-65500V... ummm, not good).\nAlas, even the second approach cannot free you from this burden entirely \\- you may be able to use more sane/safe values (the sensor has NO\\_POWER, so the measured voltage is 0V), but you still need to check sensorValue.errorCode every time \\- only exceptions would be able to help you out there (if you forget to handle them somewhere, they for terminate the program, instead of letting you work with bogus values, causing hard to track errors)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A sensor system needs to return both measurement values and error codes. Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate design solution, considering maintainability, type safety, and separation of concerns?\n\nA) Return a single double value, using negative numbers to represent error codes:\n```cpp\ndouble Sensor::compute() {\n    if (error_occurred())\n        return -65500; // Error code\n    return calculate_sensor_value();\n}\n```\n\nB) Use a struct to encapsulate both the measurement value and error code:\n```cpp\nstruct SensorOutput {\n    double value;\n    int error_code;\n};\n\nSensorOutput Sensor::compute() {\n    SensorOutput result;\n    result.value = calculate_sensor_value();\n    result.error_code = get_error_code();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nC) Use global variables to store error codes separately:\n```cpp\ndouble Sensor::compute() {\n    global_error_code = get_error_code();\n    return calculate_sensor_value();\n}\n```\n\nD) Return a std::pair<double, bool> where the bool indicates an error:\n```cpp\nstd::pair<double, bool> Sensor::compute() {\n    if (error_occurred())\n        return {0.0, true};\n    return {calculate_sensor_value(), false};\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate design solution. It encapsulates both the measurement value and error code in a single struct, which provides better type safety and separation of concerns. This approach avoids mixing contexts (normal results and error codes) in a single return value, making the code more maintainable and less prone to misinterpretation.

The idea is that the cat is both dead and alive until you look, because the state of alive or dead is entangled to a quantum superposition that is both states at the same time.\n\nHowever, I would argue that the cat is *not* both dead and alive and is either dead or alive even before you look. If a quantum superposition is only determined (collapses into a definite position) once an observer observes it, then wouldn't the Geiger counter connected to the radioisotope and hammer and bottle of poison have already 'looked' and thus 'found out,' and thus caused the superposition to collapse, even before a human observer opened the box?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a matter of interpretations of quantum mechanics and the details have not been definitely closed.\n\nOne point that you are missing here is that the box is isolated completely to the outside world.\n\nIn that case, either the whole contents of the box are in a superposition until it is open, or the Geiger counter or some other variables are enough to select one of the two outcomes.\n\n* Copenhagen interpretation claims that while not observing the system, it follows Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and when measuring everything collapses to a given outcome. Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiments puts Copenhagen advocates in a thought spot because it is not clear what constitutes a measurement (this is an open problem in general) so some will say that yes the cat is isolated from the outside world thus in a superposition of dead plus alive, and some will say that the Geiger counter is a large enough device. But if you choose the latter you have to define what is large.\n* Many\\-world interpreters only believe that Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is the only thing that exists (there is no collapse). They say that while the box is isolated the cat is indeed in a superposition. But once you open it, it entangles with the rest of the universe and it splits into two worlds with the two different outcomes.\n* Bohmians believe in hidden variables. They say that quantum mechanics is incomplete and that there are variables that determine the outcome. In that way the cat was never in a superposition of alive plus dead but one of the two. However this path is in conflict with the Bell theorem and such variables have to be very weird in a different way (nonlocal).\n\nThere are many more, however let me offer one modern perspective of this problem that partially solves it. That view is decoherence. If you have two entangled particles but you only observe one, it behaves as it is just a particle with a definite state. The same happens if we look into a subsystem instead of the entire box, the calculations show that the quantumness of the radioisotope get lost the more it gets entangled to other particles. So looking at the particle alone, we can say definitely that it looks like a system with a definite state due to the large number of particles in the measuring device interacting with the radioisotope. And as there are no perfect boxes in this universe, we can always zoom out more and more (particle and Geiger, particle\\+Geiger\\+air, box, box\\+lab, and so on) and see that the cat was never in a superposition because decoherence is even stronger the more and more particles in the subsystem. However the warning here is the same as in the above problems, what would happen if the box was truly completely isolated? And even if it is not, what happens when you look at the entire system/universe? Physicists have not agreed on a definite answer.\n\nWarning: note that aside from the impracticality of the experiment, it is not a good one. There is no measurement you can make (at least not in that specific configuration) that can tell you if the cat was in a superposition or not in the first place. It is indistinguishable from an experiment where we replace the Geiger counter and radioisotope with a classical coin throw. You should maybe take a look at [Bell tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test) and entanglement problems that show much more decisevely why quantum mechanics break classical intuitions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the decoherence perspective on Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat thought experiment, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The cat is definitely in a superposition of alive and dead states until the box is opened.\n\nB) The cat's state is determined by hidden variables, regardless of observation.\n\nC) The cat's state becomes increasingly definite as it interacts with more particles in its environment, even before the box is opened.\n\nD) The cat's state splits into two separate universes, one where it's alive and one where it's dead.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The decoherence perspective suggests that as the quantum system (in this case, the radioactive particle) interacts with more and more particles in its environment (the Geiger counter, the air in the box, the cat itself), the quantum superposition breaks down and the system behaves more like a classical system with a definite state. This process occurs gradually and continuously, even before an external observer opens the box. Therefore, from this perspective, the cat's state becomes increasingly definite due to its interactions within the box, rather than remaining in a perfect superposition until observation. This view helps bridge the gap between quantum and classical behaviors, although it doesn't fully resolve all interpretational issues, especially in perfectly isolated systems."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/114312", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/22338/"], "docs_id": 114312, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are the bounds on the possible values of the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia sets of quadratics not in the Mandelbrot set?

If the Hausdorff dimension of $q\\_c$ is $h$, can one assume that the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of $q\\_t: z \\\\mapsto z^2 \\+ \\\\gamma(t)$ tends to $h$ as $t$ tends to $1$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials has been well\\-studied, although some questions still remain. \n\nYou specifically asked about parameters $c$ that do not belong to the Mandelbrot set. In this case, the map $q\\_c(z) \\= z^2 \\+ c$ has a totally disconnected Julia set. Here is what can be said.\n\n1\\) The Hausdorff dimension is always strictly greater than zero. (This is true for all non\\-linear, non\\-constant rational functions, even for meromorphic functions, as proved by Stallard. See e.g. Corollary 2\\.11 in my paper \"Hyperbolic dimension and radial Julia sets of transcendental functions\", Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 137 (2009\\), 1411\\-1420\\.)\n\n2\\) As $c$ tends to infinity, the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set tends to zero. This is because the Julia set can be written as the limit set of a conformal iterated function system with two maps, corresponding to the inverse branches of the maps, and these are strongly contracting if $c$ is large.\n\n3\\) As Alex mentions, Hausdorff dimension does not vary continuously for parameters on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. In fact, the following is true:\n\n**Theorem.** Suppose that $c\\\\in \\\\partial M$. Then there is a sequence $(c\\_n)$ of parameters outside the Mandelbrot set such that $\\\\dim(J(q\\_{c\\_n}))\\\\to 2$. \n\nThis follows from Shishikura's famous proof that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has Hausdorff dimension equal to $2$ (\"The Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets\", Ann. of Math. 147 (1998\\), no. 2, 225\u2013267\\). Indeed, he shows that there is a dense set of parameters on the boundary where the *hyperbolic dimension* equals two. Any nearby parameter will have a Julia set of Hausdorff dimension close to $2$.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many parameters on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set where the Hausdorff dimension is strictly less than $2$. So it is not hard to see that the dimension does not depend continuously in the way that you desire.\n\nIf we ask about *radial* limits (i.e., consider the conformal map that takes the complement of the closed unit disk to the complement of the Mandelbrot set, and approach the boundary of the Mandelbrot set along the image of a straight ray), things become more subtle, and I am not sure what exactly is known. However, from what I can remember, it is known that, even for the simple case where $c(t) \\= 1/4\\+t$, $t\\>0$, the Hausdorff dimension of $J(q\\_{c(t)})$ does not tend to that of $J(q\\_{1/4})$ as $t\\\\to 0$.

Built\\-in commands are interpreted by the shell itself (e.g: `bash`). For a list of `bash`'s built\\-in commands, see the [\"*Shell Builtin Commands*\" section of the man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) (or use the `help` built\\-in).\n\nIf `cd` was not built\\-in to the shell, then it would be impossible to change directory without forking a new process each time (which would be very messy).\n\nThis is because the current working directory (like the environment) is a property of a process. These things can be inherited from a parent to a child, but cannot be \"*pushed*\" back up from children to parents.\n\nIf you really want to have a python script change the current working directory and then present a shell, you will need to do something like this:\n\n### `cd.py`\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\n\nos.chdir('/tmp/')\nos.system('bash')\n\n```\n\n### Usage:\n\n```none\n$ pwd\n/home/attie/\n$ echo $$\n30665                  # the original shell's PID\n\n$ ./cd.py\n\n$ pwd\n/tmp\n$ echo $$\n30464                  # the sub-shell's PID... it's parent is python\n\n$ exit\nexit\n\n$ pwd\n/home/attie/\n$ echo $$\n30665                  # the original shell's PID\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the `cd` command in Unix-like operating systems?\n\nA) The `cd` command is a standalone executable program stored on disk.\nB) The `cd` command can be executed by a Python script to change the working directory of the parent shell.\nC) The `cd` command is a shell built-in command interpreted by the shell itself.\nD) The `cd` command can push directory changes from child processes to parent processes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C. The `cd` command is a shell built-in command interpreted by the shell itself, not a standalone executable program. It cannot be executed by a Python script to directly change the working directory of the parent shell, as directory changes cannot be pushed from child processes to parent processes. The current working directory is a property of a process, and while it can be inherited from parent to child, it cannot be pushed back up from children to parents.

I would like to export the photos out of the survey data, which I have done by creating a script in ArcMap, using the code below from this [article](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000011912):\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nfrom arcpy import da\nimport os\n\ninTable = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nfileLocation = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(1)\n\nwith da.SearchCursor(inTable, ['DATA', 'ATT_NAME', 'ATTACHMENTID']) as cursor:\n    for item in cursor:\n        attachment = item[0]\n        filename = 'ATT' + str(item[1])\n        open(fileLocation + os.sep + filename, 'wb').write(attachment.tobytes())\n        del item\n        del filename\n        del attachment\n\n```\n\nHowever this does not allow me to rename the file using the barcode that is associated with that datapoint. So when the photos are exported, they are no longer associated with the relevant data.\n\nI would like to tell the SearchCursor function to also take the `sample_id` field from the data table and add that to the filename. When I add the sample\\_id to the array inside the SearchCursor function like this:\n\n`with da.SearchCursor(inTable, ['DATA', 'ATT_NAME', 'ATTACHMENTID', 'sample_id']) as cursor`\n\nI get the following error: `RuntimeError: A column was specified that does not exist.`\n\nI would like help in calling the `sample_id` field into the function properly so it can be added to the filename variable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your survey submits data to a feature class called 'Form\\_2' (a common default name), and the survey includes image questions (photos, signatures, etc), then...\n\nThere will be a table of related images called 'Form\\_2\\_ATTACH'. This table will have a GUID field called \"REL\\_GLOBALID\". This contains the GUID (global ID) of the survey record that the image belongs with. You can use this to join an image with it's related survey data and then you can get all the information you need.\n\nTry something like this (untested!):\n\n```\nimport arcpy, os\n\npathToGDB = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nfileLocation = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(1)\n\nsurveyFC = os.path.join(pathToGDB, \"Form_2\")\nimageTable = os.path.join(pathToGDB, \"Form_2__ATTACH\")\nimageSurveyView = \"imageSurveyView\"  #  Using a variable instead of a string makes typo errors less likely\n\narcpy.MakeTableView_management (imageTable, imageSurveyView)\narcpy.AddJoin_management (imageSurveyView, \"REL_GLOBALID\", surveyFC, \"GlobalID\", \"KEEP_ALL\")\n\n#  print [f.name for f in arcpy.ListFields(imageSurveyView)]\n\nwith arcpy.da.SearchCursor(imageSurveyView, ['Form_2__ATTACH.DATA', 'Form_2__ATTACH.ATT_NAME', 'Form_2__ATTACH.ATTACHMENTID', 'Form_2.sample_id']) as cursor:\n    for row in cursor:\n        attachment = item[0]\n        filename = 'ATT_{}_{}_{}'.format(row[1], row[2], row[3])\n        with open(os.path.join(fileLocation, filename), 'wb') as f:\n            f.write(attachment.tobytes())\n\n```\n\n(Note the change to the first parameter \\- this is the GDB, not the table. You may want to include both as separate parameters. I've hard\\-coded the table name in the code.)\n\nThis will join the image table to the survey feature class, and then the `SearchCursor` can iterate over the rows of the table view instead of the table itself. You can now use fields from both the photos table and the form table in the `SearchCursor` fields, including your `sample_id` field.\n\nNB: You may need to fully qualify your fields in the `SearchCursor` to include the table name, because the join means there are multiple tables behind this table view. Eg, use `Form_2__ATTACH.ATT_NAME` instead of `ATT_NAME` and `Form_2.sample_id` instead of `sample_id`.\n\nThe above code would include the `ATT_NAME`, the `ATTACHEMENTID` and the `sample_id` in the filename. But it's up to you which of these items you actually want to include (but if you include ONLY the sample\\_id, you may have several photo files that would end up with the same name and overwrite each other).\n\n(Note that there will also be a 'Form\\_2\\_\\_ATTACHREL' which is what ESRI call a relationship class. You can ignore this for these purposes, as you can do your join in code and use that instead. The relationship class does not contain any data (usually). It just defines the relationship between the form data feature class and the images table, including which fields are used as the key for joining the two. It is used by ArcMap or ArcGIS Online to be able to navigate from a parent record to a child record easily.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working with Survey123 data in ArcGIS and need to export photos with filenames that include both the attachment information and a field from the survey data.

I have experienced both (not in the order presented below :\\-) ).\n\nMost likely cause in general is **battery exhausted and not recharging** due to insufficient power supply voltage. Most micro\\-USB chargers are rated for 1\\.0A current; the Asus T100 requires 2\\.0A.\n\nDue to Li\\-Ion battery design, when it is just \"topping off\", the Asus will require less than 1A of current. Therefore, practically any charger will be able to top off the Asus.\n\nBut when it is markedly discharged, the Asus will attempt to suck the full 2A of current, and this will drop the input voltage a bit. If the power supply is not the original one, and is only rated for 1\\.0A, the voltage drop will be enough to drive the voltage outside the battery controller's \"comfort zone\", and the red LED light will power on (since current is being drawn) \\-\\- but the battery won't recharge, as the controller won't allow it. With some aftermarket chargers you will notice the light on the charger going off, then on, then off, continuously.\n\nPC USB ports also sometimes have an overcurrent protection, so that they won't charge a flat\\-batteried Asus even if they will allow it to top off.\n\nSolution is of course to use the original Asus power supply, or a power supply with a higher **current** rating, typically 2\\.1A (be careful; higher **current** ratings will not damage the Asus, but higher **voltage** ratings, rare as they are, definitely will). You want to have exactly 5\\.0V (the USB standard) and equal or more than 2\\.0A. Standard smartphone chargers are 1\\.0A or less, and will definitely not work, *even if they might work when the Asus isn't completely flat*. Some tablet chargers are 2\\.1A and will work.\n\nThe other possibility is a faulty battery connection. The battery has an internal connector covered by a transparent yellow adhesive protection film, but there are reports that the connector might sometimes not be plugged all the way in. Unless you're very very careful, this will void the warranty: insert a guitar pick or a thin hard **plastic** sliver between the bottom of the tablet and the screen. Drive it gently all around, and you will see the catches snap open. The cover must be slid out towards the USB power plug; do not force it open there, or you might damage the USB connector. Once removed the shell, you will see the battery (a double silvered flat package) and four connectors. The battery one is covered by an adhesive film. Try picking loose the adhesive film; the connector shouldn't move. You can use a hard plastic sliver to pry it loose and re\\-seat it until it clicks, then replace the adhesive film. When putting back the cover, first slide it over the USB connectors; don't simply press it in place. *After* the connectors are slotted in the back cover, then you can press the cover in place (you can just snap each catch closed by pinching screen and cover together with thumb and forefinger in corrispondence of each catch)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with their Asus T100 tablet not charging properly.

The documentation states that while most micro-USB chargers are rated for 1.0A, the Asus T100 requires 2.0A when significantly discharged. Using an underpowered charger can result in the battery not charging properly, even if the charging light is on. The solution is to use the original Asus power supply or a charger rated for 2.1A or higher (at 5.0V). This will ensure the tablet receives sufficient current to charge properly, especially when the battery is low.\n\nOptions A and B are less likely as the first troubleshooting step would be to try a different charger.

Latter on, I started to find random exceptions like sockets closing and ES operations failing.

Extra code has been written \\- and has to continue to be written \\- for what the framework already does quite well. Register a logging exception handler within the pipeline framework being used itself and remove the `try`..`catch` (empty) paradigm from the controller actions. The actions should look pretty slim \\- validate incoming parameters, hand them off to a service layer, and then hand a successful result back. Let unhandlable errors be logged by the pipeline.\n2. Actions in controllers are expected by and large to adhere to the REST standard. And that standard allows for error codes to be returned to the client. Analyzing an HTTP status is quick and easy and client frameworks can perform all sorts of useful boilerplate logic (such as retries, etc.) based on that.\n\nAlso, (opinion\\-based) I feel that hiding errors from consumers is akin to \"security by obscurity\" \\- maybe they don't see what's happening, but errors ARE preventing the actions from succeeding. The hunt has to begin in the file logs for what happened when \\- and first chance exceptions occur all the time in the framework itself \\- you're going to have a lot of noise to (hopefully) very little signal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team has implemented a system where all exceptions are caught and logged using a FirstChanceException event handler, and controller actions always return a value to prevent user-facing errors.

While the approach does hide errors from users, this is not considered an improvement in application security. In fact, the top answer argues that this practice is similar to \"security by obscurity,\" which is generally not recommended.

The fractional change is this divided by the initial intensity. Since we start at the middle of a fringe, the initial intensity is about half the maximum, so the fractional change is about twice the cosine term, or (8\u03c0/\u03bb) * \u0394L. Plugging in \u0394L = 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b2 m gives (8\u03c0/\u03bb) * 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b2, which simplifies to (4\u03c0/\u03bb) * 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b2."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/18", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/68204", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 68204, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've rented a space where the transformer and main panel are fenced off and I can\u2019t access it without calling the landlord.

The shapefile stores COUNTYNS with leading zeros (e.g., \"00123\"), while the CSV file stores it as an integer without leading zeros (e.g., \"123\"). This prevents the join from matching the values correctly.\n\nThe best solution is to modify the CSV file by changing the COUNTYNS field from an integer to a text data type and adding the leading zeros to match the format in the shapefile.

It means essentially connect to the assigned IP address for the server. You can use the actual IP address instead, but I find this easier: you don't have to remember or lookup up the server's IP.\n\n**FWIW:** This also works brilliantly for browser testing when you have a VM setup for bridged networking. The VM gets its own IP on the LAN with bridged networking.

Specifically, s = \u03c3 * f(\u03bd), where f(\u03bd) is a fixed function for each value of \u03bd.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because s is generally not equal to \u03c3, but rather proportional to it.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because \u221a(\u03bd/(\u03bd-2)) is the standard deviation of a standard t-distribution with \u03bd degrees of freedom, not the correction factor needed to estimate \u03c3 from s.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while s may often underestimate \u03c3, there is a way to correct for this bias by dividing s by the appropriate f(\u03bd).\n\nThe key insight is that the relationship between s and \u03c3 is consistent and can be determined through simulation, allowing for accurate estimation of \u03c3 from the robust t-distribution fit."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/05", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/153233", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/47398/"], "docs_id": 153233, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I try to apply validation for postal code on checkout like 4 numbers and 2 characters(A\\-Z) ex: \"9999AA\".\n\nNow, by default, if I press an invalid postal code on checkout page, I receive a message likes the screen\\-shot below:[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AiyRX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AiyRX.png) But even If I don't change the postal code, I press next and finish my order.  \n\nDoes anyone know how to solve this problem?  \n\nI found this link for javascript validation in magento 2 [magento2 validator](https://mage2.pro/t/topic/356) but I don't know where I can apply this validation `validate-zip-international` and then to modify this validation rule base on my format. \nOr is there another way to create a validation rule on zip code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To add validation on the zip field we should overwirte `Magento_Checkout/layout/checkout_index_index.xml` and add this code :\n\n```\n   <item name=\"validation\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"validate-zip-us\" xsi:type=\"string\">true</item>\n    </item>\n\n```\n\nLike this \n\n```\n<item name=\"postcode\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n    <item name=\"sortOrder\" xsi:type=\"string\">75</item>\n        <!-- post-code field has custom UI component -->\n    <item name=\"component\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_Ui/js/form/element/post-code</item>\n    <item name=\"validation\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n      <item name=\"required-entry\" xsi:type=\"string\">true</item>\n      <item name=\"validate-zip-us\" xsi:type=\"string\">true</item>\n    </item>\n</item>\n\n```\n\n`zip-range` for example is a already defined rule in `rules.js`. \n\nWe can overwrite this rule or we can create another rule according to our needs in this location:`Theme\\Theme\\Magento_Ui\\web\\js\\lib\\validation\\rules.js` \\>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're developing a Magento 2 e-commerce site and need to implement custom zip code validation for the Netherlands, which requires 4 numbers followed by 2 uppercase letters (e.g., 1234AB).

Here's why:\n\n1. Creating a custom module allows for clean separation of custom code from core Magento files, making it easier to maintain and upgrade.\n\n2. Adding a new validation rule to the rules.js file in a custom theme or module (Theme\\Theme\\Magento_Ui\\web\\js\\lib\\validation\\rules.js) allows you to define the specific validation logic for the Netherlands zip code format.\n\n3.

It is extremely deadly and I've seen potions with it that can go much higher.
