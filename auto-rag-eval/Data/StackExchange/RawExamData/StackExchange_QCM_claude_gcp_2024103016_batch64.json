(See below.)\n\nNotice that you don't see `NAMOQ_AD` anywhere once you've connected to `Voldemort`.\n\nNTLM pass\\-through authentication\n---------------------------------\n\nNTLM supports something called [pass\\-through authentication](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/102716). The important bit of the article is here: (emphasis added)\n\n> * If the domain name specified is not trusted by the domain, **the authentication request is processed on the computer being connected to as if the domain name specified were that domain name**. NetLogon does not differentiate between a nonexistent domain, an untrusted domain, and an incorrectly typed domain name.\n\n### Example for your net share use\n\nWhat is happening is the following:\n\n1. `Voldemort` receives a request to authenticate the user `NEMOQ_AD\\Peter`.\n2. `Voldemort` sees that `NEMOQ_AD` is neither its own domain nor any domain that it trusts.\n3. Voldemort tries to authenticate the user `ENALOG\\Peter` instead.\n4. Since you entered the password for `ENALOG\\Peter` (as you said in another comment), authentication succeeds.\n\n### Re. net shares in general\n\nWhen you are accessing the drive share, you have to be using NTLM (any attempt to use Kerberos will fail because `ENALOG` doesn't trust `NAMOQ_AD`) using pass\\-through authentication, which allows you to access network shares without typing a password. This works only when you are using identically\\-named accounts with an identical passwords on the two machines.\n\n### Re. RDP\n\nWhen you enter a password when using *Remote Desktop*, it's behaving exactly as if you had tried to log in as `ENALOG\\Peter` instead of `NEMOQ_AD\\Peter`, and using whatever password you typed in. This way, if you type `Peter` as your username, the local computer sends `NEMOQ_AD\\Peter` since that's the only domain it knows about, but the remote computer decides to try `ENALOG\\Peter` instead.\n\n### Re. SSMS\n\nI assume SQL Server Management Studio is using one strategy or the other (probably the second one), I don't know exact details of its implementation and don't have two domains lying around to test it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a network environment where computer \"Voldemort\" is in domain ENALOG and a user is attempting to connect from a computer in domain NEMOQ_AD, which is not trusted by ENALOG, what happens when the user tries to authenticate as NEMOQ_AD\\Peter?\n\nA) The authentication fails because NEMOQ_AD is not a trusted domain\nB) Voldemort attempts to authenticate the user as ENALOG\\Peter instead\nC) The user is prompted to enter credentials for an ENALOG domain account\nD) Voldemort forwards the authentication request to a NEMOQ_AD domain controller\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the NTLM pass-through authentication behavior described in the documentation, when a domain specified in the authentication request is not trusted by the target computer's domain, the authentication request is processed as if the domain name specified were the target computer's own domain name. In this case, Voldemort would attempt to authenticate the user as ENALOG\\Peter instead of NEMOQ_AD\\Peter. This allows for successful authentication if the user has an identically named account with the same password in the ENALOG domain, even though they specified NEMOQ_AD as the domain in their login attempt."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/30", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/285279", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/43530/"], "docs_id": 285279, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Periodically, Spotlight stops responding to keyboard input on my Mac.

Here's a strategy that occurs to me, though it could fail miserably.\n\nThe basic problem seems to be what you said about variance: the appearances of different spanning trees are far from independent, since it is possible to make local modifications to a spanning tree and get another one. (For example, if x is a leaf joined to y, which is joined only to z, then we can replace the path zyx by the path zxy.)\n\nOne way we might try to defeat this is to choose a random set $\\\\Sigma$ of spanning trees, where each spanning tree is chosen independently with probability $\\\\alpha^{n\\-1}$ for some carefully chosen $\\\\alpha$ (which I imagine as a small negative power of $n$). Then the expected number of trees from $\\\\Sigma$ in a $p$\\-random graph is $(\\\\alpha p)^{n\\-1}n^{n\\-2}$, which is pretty large even when $p$ is pretty close to $n^{\\-1}$. But now we might expect that any two trees in $\\\\Sigma$ are quite well\\-separated, so perhaps it is possible to get a decent estimate for the variance.\n\nActually, it's not clear to me what passing to the random set really achieves here: maybe a simpler method (but not wholly simple) is to work out the expected number of pairs of spanning trees by carefully classifying what they can look like. The hope would be that if you pick one tree at random, then the proportion of trees that overlap with it to any great extent is usually so small that the expected number of pairs is not significantly bigger than the square of the expected number of spanning trees. With $p\\=n^{\\-1\\+\\\\epsilon}$ something like this might work, but you've probably already thought about this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider an Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graph G(n,p) where p = n^(-1+\u03b5) for some small \u03b5 > 0.

When plugging my headphones there is a constant screeching sound, almost similar to a mosquito flying near your ear. I can play normal sounds, but this screeching remains as background. The internal speakers work absolutely fine. And it's not a fault in my headphones (tested two different pairs), since they don't play such sound when booting in Windows.\n\nThis seems to be a common issue, since I have found a lot of other posts aksing for help. The reason I am opening a new thread is that so far none of the offered solutions have worked for me. Therefore, I wanted to try my luck here again, I will try to outline my results for the most common solutions.\n\nBut first I will probably need to give some specifications for my laptop.\n\nThe model is the Acer Nitro 5 AN515\\-55\\-73C9 with an Intel i\\-7 10750H processor. The graphics card is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, *however* in Kubuntu I deactivated it using the NVIDIA X Server Settings and switched to the integrated Intel UHD Graphics, since this boosts my battery life from 1\\.5 hours to 8 hours and I only really need it for some gaming on Windows. **The screeching sound does not appear when instead using the NVIDIA graphics card** (Perfomance mode in NVIDIA X Server Settings). **However**, using this setting permanently is not an option for me due to the extremely short battery life. Also, I know from my old laptop that it's possible to not have this screeching sound when using the Intel UHD Graphics since there the problem does not arise when switching to Intel in the NVIDIA X Server Settings. I want to avoid using the RTX 2060 in Kubuntu at all cost, so that's why I am asking for help.\n\nAs additional information, I saw in some forum someone recommend to include the output of `lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 audio`, so here it is, even though I am not sure what this command does, I'm guessing it shows which soundcard is present.\n\n```\n00:1f.3 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation Comet Lake PCH cAVS [8086:06c8]\n        Subsystem: Acer Incorporated [ALI] Device [1025:143d]\n        Kernel driver in use: snd_hda_intel\n\n```\n\nIf you need any more information just let me know!\n\nFailed solutions\n----------------\n\nSo first I want to go through the suggestions in this thread: [Strange noise in headphones when no sound is played](https://askubuntu.com/questions/457910/strange-noise-in-headphones-when-no-sound-is-played)\n\nThe person asking the question includes the output of `sudo aplay -l`, so here you go\n\n```\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC295 Analog [ALC295 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 10: HDMI 4 [HDMI 4]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n```\n\nSo the first solution suggests to disable `loopback` in `alsamixer`, however, there is no such option available for me:\n[alsamixer with headphones plugged in](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ftNTg.png)\n\nThe next solution suggests to enter the commands\n\n```\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save_controller\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\n```\n\nbut this does practically nothing. The sounds stops for a split second but is immidiately back. Also as additional information, the screeching is there both in plugged in and plugged out mode.\n\nThe next one suggests to edit the file\n\n```\nsudo nano /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/intel-audio-powersave\n\n```\n\nbut this file doesn't exist in my system.\n\nSo the next solution is one that I have found in a lot of other threads and it seemed to have worked for most people (unfortunately not for me). The idea is the edit `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf` and add the line\n\n```\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-headset-multi\n\n```\n\nat the end. For me this changes the volume of the screeching, slightly lowering it, but it's still to loud to overhear. I saw on some website, which I can't find right now (I believe it was some sort of Ubuntu wiki), that one could try different options for the `model` options. I have found the available options for my sound card [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/sound/hd-audio/models.html#alc22x-23x-25x-269-27x-28x-29x-and-vendor-specific-alc3xxx-models). (From the previous output: my card is a ALC295\\) As a **disclaimer**: I have not tried every single option in that list, only the ones which seemed sensible to me (so any which were describing a fix with the headphone jack). I wasn't sure how using a fix for a different sound card (e.g. alc283\\-sense\\-combo) would affect my system. So part of my question is, if I can safely use all of those options? Keep in mind, the ones I tried so far did not work.\n\nThe next answer asks if tlp is activated. I don't know what this is, but the file `/etc/default/tlp` they suggest to edit, does not exist, so I guess not.\n\nThis pretty much concludes the answers in this thread. Unfortunately I can't provide the links to some solutions because I cannot find them anymore.\n\nOne thing I saw somewhere was to disable some power options, in particular to add\n\n```\noptions snd-hda-intel power_save=0\n\n```\n\nto `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`, which also didn't help for me.\n\nI saw somewhere that people are experiencing this problem with newer kernel versions. Unfortunately I am a total Ubuntu beginner (as you might have guessed already) so I have no idea about kernels. Since this is a new install of Kubuntu 20\\.04 I am not even sure if I can switch to an older kernel, let alone how to. But if you think it's worth a try, let me know!\n\nA lot of answers also try to fix the problem using `pulseaudio`. Running the command `pulseaudio` in the terminal yields:\n\n```\nE: [pulseaudio] pid.c: Daemon already running.\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: pa_pid_file_create() failed.\n\n```\n\nAs I understood this is due to `pulseaudio` running already, but running `pulseaudio -k ; pulseaudio --start` does nothing\n\nRight now these are all the things I can think of. I hope for now this is enough information, but again, if you need more infos just let me know!\n\nI appreciate any help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some Gnome extensions that do exactly that:\n\n* [Window Is Ready \\- Notification Remover](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1007/window-is-ready-notification-remover/)\n* [Focus my window](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1005/focus-my-window/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing a constant screeching sound through their headphones after installing Kubuntu 20.04 as a dual boot on their Acer Nitro 5 laptop.

The support should let the ad carry get ALL the creeps. If the ad carry is not present the support should not push BUT it can last hit and get a couple minions if the turret would kill them anyway. But the general idea is to facilitate your carry to farm more, so even if the carry is back at a moment you shouldn't push the lane by farming.\n\n***2***\n\nIts ok to kill neutral creeps when the jungler is somewhere far away. Actually it's a well known tactic to kill the golems when they spawn at level 1, if the jungler starts at blue. Because by the time the jungler will come to the golems they will have respawned. The idea is to kill any minor camps you can if the jungler is busy somewhere else far from that camp. You don't want to steal your jungler's farm but you don't want to let those camps staying there unexploited for no reason either. \nSo you have to have good awareness of the time it takes for those camps to respawn. If you think you don't you should probably leave them for your jungler.\n\n***1*** \n\nThere is nothing set in stone here. I'd say around 100 creeps at the 12\\-15 minute mark would be nice but it all depends on the game. What you should do as an ad carry is try to outfarm the other ad carry and you should have more farm than anyone in the game to be honest. Thats when you know that you're doing well.

However, when the AD Carry is not in lane and minions are about to die to the turret, it's acceptable for the Support to last hit those minions to prevent the gold from being wasted. This balances maximizing the AD Carry's farm while not letting resources go to waste when they're unavailable. Options A and D are incorrect because they involve the Support taking CS away from the AD Carry, which is counterproductive to the Support's role.

Service A observes DB and sends data to the topic once the worker is finished (status=Done on the job)\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThe approach using a shared database and a Postgres queue seems to me more safe and controllable, but at the same time the approach using Kafka as a common message broker seems more modern and sustainable.\n\nAny thoughts on this?

So a logit model (DK versus notDK) and a Proportional Odds Model per the ordinal part.\n\nI've looked for some literature on the argument but I have found nothing in particular. Any suggestion? Does it make sense, anyway, as approach?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am finding in my reading about hurdle models is that they may not be as simultaneous as they seem to me, despite being done in one R command. [(See my question recently posted here on CV.)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/320924/hurdle-models-are-they-really-their-own-model-or-just-two-separate-sequential)\n\nI have dealt with this before, and this was my reasoning: \n\nThe only way that I would put \"don't know\" in the middle is that if the measurement tool actually positioned it in the middle of the scale. I don't agree with this measurement style, but I think that participants might interpret \"don't know\" to be \"neutral\" if the scale looks like, on the survey that the participant sees:\n\n```\nstrongly disagree - mildly disagree - don't know - mildly agree - strongly agree\n\n```\n\nIf this is the case, then I think it would be fair to just do one ordinal model, although I think the problem is with the *measurement* being confusing to the participant\u2014not necessarily a statistical issue.\n\nHowever, if the measurement tool placed \"don't know\" on the outside like I've seen others do, e.g.:\n\n```\nstrongly disagree - mildly disagree - mildly agree - strongly agree || don't know\n\n```\n\nThen I think your two\\-step approach is totally valid. It is similar to and in the spirit of hurdle models (as far as I know about them\u2014see the above link for evidence that I am still somewhat confused). The only thing I might change is:\n\n1. Do a multinomial logistic regression, using \"don't know\" as the reference category and collapsing the two agree values together and the two disagree values together. That way you can predict the odds of people moving from don't know to agree and don't know to disagree. This can be done by recoding strongly/mildly agree into \"agree\" and recode strongly/mildly disagree into \"disagree,\" then making \"don't know\" the first level in a `factor` variable that represents this three\\-category dependent variable. I've only fit these models in Stan, but it seems pretty straightforward using the `multinom` function from the `nnet` package, although I would suggest reading up on it to see if everything matches what you think it is doing.\n2. Do an ordered logistic regression, excluding the cases that are \"don't know\" from the sample. This can be done by assigning your dependent variable as `factor` with levels ordered correctly, and then using the `clm` function from the `ordinal` package:\n\n`model2 <- ordinal::clm(dv ~ iv, data = dat)`\n\nThis two\\-step approach is similar to the hurdle model in that you are explicitly modeling two different kinds of processes: First, having no opinion vs. agreeing or disagreeing; Second, level of agreement. \n\nLastly, if you are interested in trying to predict whether or not people have an opinion\u2014regardless of direction (disagree or agree)\u2014then you should do a logistic regression predicting don't know versus any other response. It depends on what you are interested in at that point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing survey data with a response scale that includes \"Don't Know\" (DK) responses alongside ordinal agreement categories.

The error message indicates that \\beamer@cramped is an undefined control sequence when using a custom frame environment.

This method aligns with the principle described in the documentation about creating a baseline model using the training data distribution. It avoids data leakage from the test set and provides a meaningful comparison point for more complex models. \n\nOption A is incorrect because simply transforming variables doesn't necessarily solve the fundamental issue of perfect multicollinearity in ownership percentages. \n\nOption B, while sometimes used, is not ideal as it arbitrarily removes potentially important information based on a single correlation metric. \n\nOption D is incorrect because ignoring multicollinearity can lead to unreliable coefficient estimates and interpretations.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows for a robust benchmark while maintaining the integrity of the analysis and avoiding data leakage between train and test sets."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/21", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/327087", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/173378/"], "docs_id": 327087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was simply fiddling with [Ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fuck&year_start=1770&year_end=1993&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cfuck%3B%2Cc0) when my apparently naughty mind made me type the (real) \"F\\-word\" onto the text field, (the time was also chosen randomly, (1750\\-to\\-1993\\)), the [results](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fuck&year_start=1770&year_end=1993&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cfuck%3B%2Cc0) baffled me.

Specifically, in the Map.js file, there's a line that sets a 250ms timeout for the zoom transition to end, regardless of the CSS transition duration. This causes the animation to be cut short and jump to the final zoom level. \n\nThe relevant code is:\nsetTimeout(L.bind(this._onZoomTransitionEnd, this), 250);\n\nThis timeout was implemented due to cross-browser compatibility issues with CSS transforms for zoom animations. While changing the CSS transition time might initially slow down the animation, it will still be interrupted by this hard-coded timeout, resulting in the observed jumping behavior.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't address the root cause of the issue as explained in the StackExchange answer.

This is often overlooked when setting up new user roles with limited permissions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no specific \"Advanced Reporting\" section under Catalog > Products.\nOption B is incorrect because enabling Advanced Reporting is done globally, not per user, and it's already mentioned that it's working for the main admin account.\nOption D is incorrect because there's no mention of a specific \"Advanced Reporting user group\" in Magento 2's standard setup.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of Magento 2's permission structure and the sometimes non-intuitive location of certain permission settings."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/22", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/37974511", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2646124/"], "docs_id": 37974511, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\nError:A problem occurred configuring root project 'app_name'.\n> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':_debugCompile'.\n > Could not find com.crashlytics.sdk.android:answers-shim:0.0.3.\n     Searched in the following locations:\n         https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.pom\n         https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.aar\n         file:/Users/arun/repos/app_name/libs/answers-shim-0.0.3.aar\nfile:/Users/arun/repos/app_name/libs/answers-shim.aar\n         https://maven.fabric.io/public/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.pom\n         https://maven.fabric.io/public/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.aar\n         file:/Users/arun/Library/Android/sdk/extras/android/m2repository/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.pom\n         file:/Users/arun/Library/Android/sdk/extras/android/m2repository/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.aar\n         file:/Users/arun/Library/Android/sdk/extras/google/m2repository/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.pom\n         file:/Users/arun/Library/Android/sdk/extras/google/m2repository/com/crashlytics/sdk/android/answers-shim/0.0.3/answers-shim-0.0.3.aar\n     Required by:\n         :app_name:unspecified > io.branch.sdk.android:library:1.14.2\n\n```\n\nbranch\\-io originally was `io.branch.sdk.android:library:1+` I then tried\n\n`io.branch.sdk.android:library:1.14.1` and `io.branch.sdk.android:library:1.14.2` with the same error.\n\nAny ideas what is happening?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `com.crashlytics.sdk.android:answers-shim:0.0.3` isn't available on mavenCentral.

In the above example I'm also pushing it in `$logger`, the `Logger` instance.\n\n(And also note that simply adding this processor to your code won't solve your issue, since the call to `Logger::info()` would always happen in `app_log::info()`).\n\nRemember that you'll need to add the corresponding `use` statement: `use Monolog\\Processor\\IntrospectionProcessor;`\n\nI do not know all the details of your system, and can't build it all for you anyway, but if dependency injection is still too much for you, you could just cheat temporarily with a global\\-state approach.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```\nfunction get_logger() {\n   static $logger;\n\n   if ($logger !== null) {\n      return $logger;\n   }\n\n   $logger  = new Logger('applog');\n   $handler = new RotatingFileHandler('useractivity.log', 0, Logger::INFO);\n   $handler->setFormatter(new LineFormatter(\"[%datetime%] %extra.process_id% %channel%.%level_name%: %message% %extra% %context% \\n\"));\n   $logger->pushHandler($handler);\n   $logger->pushProcessor(new WebProcessor);\n   $logger->pushProcessor(new IntrospectionProcessor);\n\n   return $logger;\n}\n\n```\n\nYou could put this in a file that you `require_once`, and in each of these places where you need access to the logger you can simply do:\n\n```\n get_logger()->info('write to the log!');\n\n```\n\n**This is not something I'd endorse**, but a crummy workaround for you to get moving until you advance somewhat in your understanding of other OOP topics.

Override directly the modal templating from `Magento_Ui` \\-\\> `vendor/magento/module-ui/view/base/web/templates/modal` folder has all the templates for every option of the modal, including header, wrapper and footer.

Like I said before, this will change all the modal templates across the site, not only the one you \"need\" to.\n2. Extend the modal widget and create your own call to your new template path. This one is more complicated if you are not experienced with how Magento 2 development fallback works. For instance you will need to create your new widget for the new modal within your module, call the modal widget and extend it, change on the require path for a new template (depending on which type you want to change properly) and change the function `_renderModal` within your widget to call for the new template.\n\nTo give you the whole answer for the second option will take a lot, and requires for you to read more about how Magento development works and be familiar with it.

So all I'm left with is a hard Power button reset or `sudo shutdown -h now` (another workaround is to click Restart with admin rights on the login window, I presume it's the same as the terminal command).\n\nThis problem is accompanied (and may or may not be caused) by many others:\n\n* Certain apps may refuse to quit against all measures as well, thereby hanging out in the Dock and halting the shutdown\n* Quick Preview (handy `Spacebar` thing) is showing nothing but empty white rectangles\n* Preview itself opening all files as empty windows or practicing other weird behaviours like not showing the pixel selection frame\n* Finder throwing up a self\\-conscious *\u00abThe application \u201cFinder.app\u201d is not open anymore\u00bb* in response to launching apps or opening windows through Spotlight (even though `\u2318-Enter` to show file location still works)\n* Folders appear to be empty until Finder is relaunched (manually or by itself)\n* Unable to launch some apps, notably Photos\n* Minor rare cases of graphics corruptions, like garbled windows in Mission Control\n\nAll of these get fixed by a Mac restart, but keep steadily accumulating again. It's like the more time elapses after a restart, the more ruined and deteriorated the system becomes.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n* Resetting NVRAM\n* Resetting the SMC\n* Performing an extended Apple Hardware Test (no issues were found)\n* Verifying hard drive and repairing disk permissions\n* Booting in Safe Mode (where everything gets super slow; the problem persists)\n\nFor a positive note, this whole situation has taught me to do frequent Time Machine backups, but I would like to leave OS reinstallation as a last resort. (My drive is partitioned into two, with Windows 7 installed through Boot Camp, if that has significance.) I know that Yosemite is quite old, but I'm honestly scared of upgrading lest it becomes worse (performance loss, new glitches, feel free to reassure me).\n\nSo, could anyone provide tips on what the root of this problem may be and how to fix it? Logs I should check, tests I can do, files to wipe or redact? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you, and safe travels!\n\n---\n\n**Update 1**:  \n\nI have tried booting into Safe Mode once again, acting out some generic work and having a look at the Activity Monitor. Here is what it looks like:\n\n[![Activity Monitor within Safe Mode](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kdk4A.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kdk4A.png)\n\nInterestingly, the computer seems to shut down properly from Safe Mode. Once again though, some window animations are extremely slow to render here, producing beautiful scrolling lines.\n\nThen, I booted normally and did roughly the same manipulations. The Monitor from here:\n\n[![Activity Monitor within normal boot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7B7Q.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7B7Q.png)\n\nI also tried shutting down in normal mode *immediately* after landing on the desktop after a restart, which *works*. So one can assume there is a software gimmick that is causing this problem shortly after startup.\n\n**Update 2**:  \n\nI created a new Standard (non\\-Admin) account as was suggested, and I think that helped to uncover the exact criminal in disguise \u2014 **Finder**. It seems like everything works nicely (while launching and switching apps), until the first Finder window is open (any folder), which somehow makes Finder unresponsive on shutdown, thereby freezing the latter. This happens on both user accounts. Interestingly, switching to another user and doing a \u00abproper\u00bb shutdown (from Apple menu) before using Finder is working (although I guess the \u00abblocked\u00bb user's session is still halted abruptly and incorrectly then).\n\nNow, the **question is**: *what exactly is wrong with Finder*, and how can I help the little guy?\n\n**Update 3**:  \n\nAs suggested, I tried moving Finder cache and preference files to desktop through the Terminal while logged in as a different user, but this doesn't seem to affect the problem.\n\nI could find no crash logs for Finder apart from some short diagnostic reports, and noticed nothing unusual displayed by the Console while the faulty shutdown is in process, but here is an example of some fishy Finder\\-related events which may be happening during uptime:\n\n[![Fishy Finder-related messages in Console](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nORgO.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nORgO.png)\n\n(I do not know how significant these are; the Console spits out things like that from various processes regularly).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's what I would try:\n\n1.

No matter what I do this keeps happening and it only happens when I try to move it back to desktop. Any ideas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your current location is important when using commands in `cmd`. Though you can use absolute paths to avoid needing to worry about your current folder, which is often important in batch files.\n\nAbsolute Paths\n==============\n\nFor example, if your file is located here:\n\n```\nC:\\users\\julio\\desktop\\testfolder\\testfile.txt\n\n```\n\nThen this command will work from anywhere on the c: drive:\n\n```\nmove C:\\users\\julio\\desktop\\testfolder\\testfile.txt    C:\\users\\julio\\desktop\\\n\n```\n\nThese are called absolute paths because you are saying exactly where the source and destinations are.\n\nRelative Paths\n==============\n\nRelative paths are much more convenient to use when at the command prompts. There are two key shortcuts you should be aware of:\n\nThis refers to the parent directory of the one you are in:\n\n```\n .. \n\n```\n\nThis refers to the current directory:\n\n```\n .\n\n```\n\nSo, if you aleady in the `C:\\users\\julio\\desktop\\testfolder\\` and you want to move `testfile.txt` up one level to the parent folder: `C:\\users\\julio\\desktop\\`, then you can use this shortcut:\n\n```\nmove testfile.txt ..\n\n```\n\nThis means \"move the `testfile.txt` from the current folder to its parent folder\".\n\nOn the otherhand, if you were already in the `C:\\users\\julio\\desktop` folder, you can do this:\n\n```\nmove testfolder\\testfile.txt .\n\n```\n\nThis means \"move the file `testfile.txt` from the folder `testfolder` which is directly below my current location, to my current location.\"\n\nYour current location is generally in your prompt."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are in the directory C:\\users\\julio\\desktop and want to move a file named \"report.docx\" from the subdirectory \"work\" to the current directory using the command prompt.

You define the percentage of variance and then you select the column (which is also the number of that principal component) which cumulatively accounts the variance you would like to keep. For 85% and more variance on your example, you would need to keep 7 principal components.\n\nConcerning the added plot, it might be more tricky to read it. In order to proceed as described in the previous paragraph, when you are given some percentage to keep, you would first integrate and then read off the value of needed components. Actually you have this information already, this is the very same \"Cumulative Proportion\" field. Just plot it and you will see.\n\nFinally about the (non)inclusion of class variable into the dataset to be analyzed with PCA. Your intent is to analyze the dataset given some measurements and not the class label. The class label is some additional information (typically posterior). You don't want it to be analyzed together with the dataset. It will be hard to interpret the maximum variance directions if the dataset included *also* the class variable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a wine dataset and obtains the following cumulative proportion values for the first 7 principal components:\n\nPC1: 0.2535\nPC2: 0.4743\nPC3: 0.6111\nPC4: 0.70011\nPC5: 0.77016\nPC6: 0.82520\nPC7: 0.87218\n\nIf the goal is to explain at least 85% of the variance in the data, how many principal components should be retained, and what is the best practice regarding the inclusion of the class variable in the PCA?\n\nA) Retain 5 principal components and include the class variable in the PCA to improve classification.\n\nB) Retain 6 principal components and exclude the class variable from the PCA to focus on measurement variables.\n\nC) Retain 7 principal components and include the class variable in the PCA for comprehensive analysis.\n\nD) Retain 7 principal components and exclude the class variable from the PCA to focus on measurement variables.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. To explain at least 85% of the variance, 7 principal components should be retained, as PC7 has a cumulative proportion of 0.87218 (87.218%), which exceeds the 85% threshold. Additionally, it's best practice to exclude the class variable from PCA. The class variable is typically considered additional information and not part of the core measurements.

Using @import at the top of your CSS section allows you to include external stylesheets while maintaining the correct loading order, ensuring your custom styles take precedence.\nOption D is a poor practice that makes your CSS difficult to maintain and should be avoided when possible.\n\nThe @import method allows you to include external stylesheets within your CSS section, which is injected into the <head>, thus loading before your custom styles and allowing you to override them as needed."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/03", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/49529", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/10616/"], "docs_id": 49529, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was recently hit by a fireball and knocked off the edge of my platform in the nether.
