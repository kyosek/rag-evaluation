So far here's what I've experienced:\n\n* I initially got a BSOD while doing normal web browsing\n* After rebooting; said there was no boot drive\n* After a hard power recycle (turning it off and then back on); the drive was recognized. (note that this seems to happen after every BSOD; if i just restart; it's not found, but if i turn it all the way off/back on; then it's recognized)\n* Checking the BIOS; the drive sometimes shows; sometimes not (see above line item)\n* Ran Disk Cleanup \\& Defragmented; issue reoccured eventually\n* Tried plugging the HD into a diffrent SATA port; issue reoccured eventually\n* Tried using a different SATA cable; issue reoccured eventually\n* Tried reinstalling Windows 7 on top of itself; issue reoccured eventually\n\nI'm suspecting the drive is on it's last legs. (it's a 64GB SSD that's about 2 years old used for OS only).\n\nDid i miss any troubleshooting steps? Anything else it could be other than drive failure?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You ruled out the possibility of a bad SATA cable/port, which is good. However, maybe there is an issue with the power supply? In my experience it is unlikely, but if you have an extra power supply and some free time on your hands try hooking that up and seeing if the problem persists.\n\nAs well, find an SSD testing utility for your drive. There are many out there and often manufacturers will have their own (you didn't specify what drive you have, but just do a quick search and you'll find something). For example, here is one for Intel SSDs [https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail\\_Desc.aspx?agr\\=Y\\&DwnldID\\=18455](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=18455).\n\nUpdate: you may want to run Windows chkdsk. Also, make sure you have the latest firmware for the drive and any updates.\nSSDs \"fail\" somewhat differently from regular hard drives. If there are any bad cells the SSD won't use them, effectively decreasing the capacity of the drive. But a \"failure\" is usually all\\-or\\-nothing... the drive will just brick itself and not be useable at all."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing intermittent issues with their SSD, including BSODs and the drive not being recognized.

The top answer recommends using an SSD-specific testing utility, often provided by the manufacturer, to accurately assess the drive's health and performance. This step was not mentioned in the user's initial troubleshooting attempts and could provide valuable information about the SSD's condition. Options A and C are premature without confirming the drive's status, and D (upgrading RAM) is unrelated to the described symptoms."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/07/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1566725", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/618572/"], "docs_id": 1566725, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: EDIT: I'm on Windows 10 and I think the `which` command is available because of an installation of Git for Windows.\n\nIf I type `which nvm` in to PowerShell, I get `/c/Users/HP/AppData/Roaming/nvm/nvm`. If I then want to navigate to that location, `/cd c/Users/HP/AppData/Roaming/nvm/nvm` fails as path not found.\n\nHow can I get a path that I can use with `cd` please?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you are using PowerShell anyway, why not using PowerShell?\n\nThe equivalent of `which` or `where.exe` in PowerShell is `Get-Command`. This will return an object. Example:\n\n```\nGet-Command ping\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```none\nCommandType     Name                                               Version    Source\n-----------     ----                                               -------    ------\nApplication     PING.EXE                                           10.0.18... C:\\Windows\\system32\\PING.EXE\n\n```\n\nAs you are looking for the path, you need the `Path` property:\n\n```\n(Get-Command ping).Path\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```none\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\PING.EXE\n\n```\n\nThis is at least a path, Windows will understand. But you cannot change your working directory to it as it is not a directory, but an executable. You can again use some PowerShell magic and extract the parent path of the executable:\n\n```\nSplit-Path (Get-Command ping).Path\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```none\nC:\\Windows\\system32\n\n```\n\nYou can then use this path to change your working directory. Btw, `cd` in PowerShell is an alias for `Set-Location` which you can verify with `Get-Command cd`. In conclusion you can pipe your result to `cd` or to `Set-Location` and get your desired solution in one line (prompt not stripped to see the result):\n\n```\nPS C:\\> Split-Path (Get-Command ping).Path | cd\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In PowerShell on Windows 10, you want to find the location of the 'nvm' command and navigate to its directory.

I needed to use their existing tables and add a bunch of new fields. \n\nI had the option of either creating new tables in their design style (which consists of almost all the propeties being in one big table), or creating a new set of tables alltogether and using something extra such as Triggers to synchronize data between the new and old tables.\n\nI ended up going with the first option of using the existing poor design style, but I was left with this question: **Is it better to go with pre\\-existing bad practices, or to implement good practices that do not play nicely with existing code?

You are going to be taking over a large part of future coding\n2. Better design isn't more expensive to the client in the long run. For instance, I have witnessed multi\\-month \"refactorings\" for projects that were discontinued by the end of the year.\n\nYou should choose \"same bad style\" if:\n\n1. You're just helping out. It's unrealistic to think you can take an existing group and will them to higher design standards if you're just a part\\-time fill\\-in on the project. Better design is subjective and almost always has a learning curve. If that new design isn't learned by the rest of the team then the project will end up with a mish\\-mash of styles, and your better designed code may end up in the pile of stuff that nobody changes because they can't understand it. In your example above, what happens if there are updates to the third party software?\n2. Sacrificing \"better\" design will get you a tangible business advantage. Like adding feature X badly will get you a large contract, but missing the deadline causes you to end up with nothing. This is where the historic conflict between mgmt and the technical team come in.

On the other hand, if the intended goal is to match some \"correctness\" norm, then it doesn't matter whether it's clear.\n\nThe issue is ***taken***, which is, as noted, a participial adjective. That identification, however, doesn't mean that\n it behaves like an adjective, nor that it originated as an adjective. \n\nIn fact, *taken* is the remains of the deceased passive relative clause *which were taken*, and that in turn is the remains of the active relative clause *which `Agent` took* (where `Agent` represents whoever took the radiograms, which may or may not be relevant, and may or may not be explained elsewhere in the paper). Passive and then Whiz\\-Deletion have applied, leaving only the single word *taken*, which has not had time to shed its verbish habits and resists moving to a prenominal adjective position. \n\nTo avoid such problems, my advice is not to delete so much.

This also separates the bare NP *steps* from what follows.\n2. Preposed adverbial clauses are followed by a ***comma***. This represents the intonation contour with which they are pronounced, and signals the reader that there **is** a preposed adverbial clause here (even though some of its markers, like *In order*, have been deleted).\n3. There is no reason (besides a possible technical style sheet) to use the passive ***taken*** when the Agent can be identified as an active subject. Here I have identified it with the authors, as Principal Investigators, which may be wrong; but it should be identified if it's possibly relevant, and this is a good place to do it. Plus, it simplifies the grammar, again.\n4. Likewise, the authors are identified as the ones using the bad samples for illustration in an active main clause *we use*, rather than a passive ***is used***.\n\nI have nothing against Passive constructions, and they are useful.

Direct imaging of quarks is not possible due to their extremely small size and the high energies required to probe at that scale. When particles are bombarded with such high energies, they fragment and create new particles, making direct observation impossible. Instead, scientists deduce the arrangement and properties of quarks by analyzing the debris from high-energy collisions and working backwards to determine the original state. This method has led to the understanding that quarks likely form a stable triangular shape within protons and neutrons, held together by virtual gluons.

As the applied voltage increases beyond this point, the transistor starts to conduct more current, but the base-emitter voltage remains relatively constant due to the diode-like behavior of the junction. This creates a natural voltage clamp, preventing the base voltage from rising much above 0.8V regardless of the applied voltage.

Of the various examples I could use, there are a few basic forms: \n\nImplicit Specification\n----------------------\n\nMike is actually a target for an assassination attempt by a terror organization. In all their correspondences between each other, they refer to 'the night,' though it's never stated that 'the night' is when they execute their plan (and Mike.)\n\nIn this case, sentences that refer to 'the night' are implicitly assumed to mean *that* night. \n\nFor example:\n\n> Remember that Mike will be singing on the night. We need to take him out on stage.\n\nInferred Specification\n----------------------\n\nIf, in a previous sentence, 'the night' is identified, then the value is used by inference. @Billy Kerr provided an excellent example of this in the comments:\n\n> The concert will be held on Friday evening. It's going to be wonderful. Mike will sing on the night.\n\nIn this case, 'the night' refers to Friday evening. \n\nExtended Literal Specification\n------------------------------\n\nMaybe the sentence you provided wasn't complete. If I were to complete it, I'd expand it to something like:\n\n> Mike is going to sing on the night of the 25th\n\nThis explicitly describes *which* night Mike will sing on within the scope of the sentence. \n\nThis usage could be better viewed as an extension of 'on the (date)'. One would logically say \n\n> Mike is going to sing on the 25th\n\nwhich describes when Mike will sing. If we prepend 'the night of' to 'the 25th', then we talk more specifically about when Mike will sing.\n\nNoun Form\n---------\n\nIf 'On the Night' is the title of a song, then Mike would be singing that song.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion\n-------------\n\nYou can't use that grammar without the understanding that 'the night' refers to something specific."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the usage of \"at night\" and \"on the night\" is most accurate?\n\nA) \"At night\" and \"on the night\" are interchangeable in all contexts.\nB) \"On the night\" can only be used when referring to a specific night that has been previously mentioned or is understood from context.\nC) \"At night\" is always the correct phrase to use when talking about nighttime in general.\nD) \"On the night\" is the preferred phrase for describing any nighttime activity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because \"on the night\" is used specifically when referring to a particular night that has been previously mentioned or is understood from context. This could be through implicit specification, inferred specification, or extended literal specification. \"At night\" is generally used to talk about nighttime in a general sense, while \"on the night\" requires a specific reference. Options A and D are incorrect because these phrases are not interchangeable in all contexts, and \"on the night\" is not the preferred phrase for all nighttime activities.

In the initial circuit, when the MOSFET turns on, the voltage across it drops, reducing the voltage available to drive the gate. This can lead to the MOSFET operating in a partially-on state, causing excessive power dissipation and overheating.

This compactness can be influenced by the smoothness of the boundary, but a specific degree of smoothness is not always necessary or sufficient. Option C accurately reflects this nuanced relationship between the spectrum properties, the compactness of the embedding, and potential boundary smoothness requirements.

The application is fairly heavy on queries, most pages of my application have several queries with several joins as well as triggers on most the tables. As long as the database has enough RAM for it's buffer pool I'm guessing performance should be fine, so if I go with a VPS host like Linode I can just keep upgrading my server so the database has enough RAM. My concern is what happens when I can't get more RAM, how much does performance suffer when a database doesn't have enough RAM? Should I look at the decreasing free memory available like it were a ticking time bomb? Does the DBMS change it's caching techniques to avoid disk accesses whenever possible? Essentially I want to know how smart DBMS's are and how they cope before sharding or replication is used.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Programs, in general, are exactly as smart as they are programmed. DBMSes are programs. So without knowing what DBMS you're using, it's impossible to say, in general, what will happen. So, the only correct answer to your question is a close vote as \"not a real question\" (which I note someone has already done). However, I've got some spare time, so I'll write up a general screed on database scaling and performance, in the hope it might answer the question you *should* be asking.\n\nSince you're using the not\\-really\\-hip\\-any\\-more term \"DBMS\", I'll assume you're using a not\\-really\\-hip\\-any\\-more relational database, though, and there things get more complicated. The engines I'm familiar with (MySQL and PostgreSQL) both have a zillion knobs to tell the system how much RAM to use \\-\\- caches of various things, working set memory, buffers... it's all a lot of fun. Tuning them appropriately for the workload and available system resources is mostly (though not entirely) about reducing disk I/O, since that is usually (though, again, not always) the slowest and most\\-likely\\-to\\-cause\\-a\\-bottleneck component in the physical system.\n\nThus, when you are unable to increase RAM any further, your performance will start to suffer (hopefully gradually) as more queries require more disk accesses to complete. The performance degradation with database size increase will be exacerbated by how poor the disk I/O performance is.\n\nGiven how hard it is to horizontally scale a relational database (it's not *impossible*, but it's a whole hell of a lot harder than horizontally scaling frontends), if you're intending on doing things at scale, you need a provider that can give you big machines \\-\\- lots of RAM, but also lots of CPU, disk space *and* IOPS. Linode's largest VM appears to be 20GB, which is way too small. AWS has instances with up to 70GB or so of RAM, which is better, but when you can get a physical machine with a TB (or more) of RAM... it's still not real clever. \n\nIt's not that a VM is always *wrong* for a database server, but at some point, when you outgrow the available VM options, you need to know what you're going to do next. It's increasingly common for people to go down the \"shard early, shard often\" path, because if you're going for massive scale there isn't a physical machine on earth that'll save you, and it means you can run on whatever dinky\\-toy cloud you like. Sharding is a lot of work to do right, though, and limits your options somewhat in the way you model and interact with your data, so I like to avoid it if I can. The thing is, physical hardware moves at a fairly steady clip, and there's a lot of headroom already available for you to grow into, so by the time you've got a database that needs 2TB of RAM and 30TB of storage (roughly the largest spec single physical machine I can buy at the moment), technology is likely to have improved to the point where a machine with 4TB of RAM and 100TB of storage costs *less* than what you paid for that 2TB monster.\n\n(Disclaimer: I work at a hosting provider that does a lot of hybrid VPS/physical setups on behalf of customers of various sizes, and I'm sure this colours my judgment on the subject)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is developing a database-intensive application and is considering various hosting options.

The original code was not writing the headers to the CSV file and was incorrectly iterating over the entire data object instead of just the row data. By adding `csv_file.writerow(data['headers'])` before the for loop, we ensure that the headers are written as the first row of the CSV file. Then, changing the for loop to `for rowSet in data['rowSet']:` ensures that we're iterating over just the row data. This modification correctly writes both the headers and the row data to the CSV file.\n\nOption A is partially correct but incomplete, as it doesn't address writing the headers.\nOption C is incorrect as it would attempt to combine headers and row data in each row.\nOption D is unnecessary, as `json.load(f)` already correctly parses the JSON file."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/02", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/14657627", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1217150/"], "docs_id": 14657627, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking at code that someone else wrote, and it has a lot of debug sections, of type \n\n```\nif(0) { code }\n\n```\n\nor `if(1) { code }`\n\nor `if(false) { code }`\n\nThere is even \n\n```\n#if(0)\n#endif\n\n```\n\n(which did not turn gray though \\- I thought that it should)\n\nI was wondering, if I replace these with some `#if 0` (or `#ifdef _DEBUG`), is it possible to optimize the code ? \\- or \\- it will not make any difference ?\n\nI think that it may help, since I have seen code that is within these sections being grayed out \\- and I thought that this code is removed from the Release executable...

I am trying to figure out what are all the things that could make this code take fewer hours. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If expressions placed inside those IFs are **constant and determinable at the time of compilation**, then you may be almost sure that the compiler has already removed them off the code for you.\n\nOf course, if you compile in Debug\\-Mode, and/or if you have optimization\\-level set to zero, then the compiler may skip that and leave those tests \\- but with plain zero/one/true/false values it is highly unlikely.\n\nFor a compile\\-time constant branches, you may be sure that the compiler removed the dead ones.\n\nIt is able to remove even complex\\-looking cases like:\n\n```\nconst int x = 5;\n\nif( 3 * x * x < 10 ) // ~ 75 < 10\n{\n    doBlah(); // skipped\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, without that 'const' marker at X, the expression's value may be not determinable at the compile time, and it may 'leak' into the actual final product.\n\nAlso, the value of expression in following code is not necesarily compile\\-time constant:\n\n```\nconst int x = aFunction();\n\nif( 3 * x * x < 10 ) // ~ 75 < 10\n{\n    doBlah(); // skipped\n}\n\n```\n\nX is a constant, but it is initialized with value from a function. X will most probably be not determinable at the time of compilation. In runtime the function could return any value\\*) so the compiler must assume that X is unknown.\n\nTherefore, if you have possibility, then use preprocessor. In trivial cases that won't do much, because the compiler already knew that. But cases are not always trivial, and you will notice the change vrey often. When optimizer fails to deduce the values, it leaves the code, even if it is dead. Preprocessor on the other hand is guaranteed to remove disabled sections, before they get compiled and optimized. Also, using preprocessor to do that at least will speed up the compilation: the compiler/optimizer will not have to traceconstants/calculate/checkbranches etc.\n\n\\*) it is possible to write a method/function which return value will actually be determinable at the compilation and optimization phases: if the function is simple and if it gets inlined, its result value might be optimized out along with some branches.. But even if you can somewhat rely on removing the if\\-0 clauses, you cannot rely on the inlining as much.."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is reviewing code with numerous debug sections using if(0), if(1), if(false), and #if(0) constructs.

This can improve both optimization potential and compilation speed, especially for complex cases where the compiler might struggle to determine constant expressions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply replacing with #ifdef _DEBUG doesn't guarantee faster execution; it depends on how the code is compiled and optimized.\n\nOption B is partially true but overstated. While compilers are good at optimizing simple constant expressions, they may not always remove more complex ones, especially if they involve function calls or non-const variables.\n\nOption D is incorrect.

[Running Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:Running_Mono_Applications)\n\nFrom the Mono Project on using binfmt:\n\n**Registering .exe as non\\-native binaries (Linux only)**\n\nBecause this is a Linux\\-specific feature, we do not recommend that developers deploy this solution, as it would limit the portability of their scripts.\n\nIn addition, this mechanism does not work as intended by the [Application Deployment Guidelines](http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment).\n\nYou can also make a systemwide change, and use binfmt to register the exe files as non\\-native binaries. Then, when trying to launch an exe file, the kernel will run the mono interpreter to handle the command. Binfmt can also be used to launch Windows executables using WINE, or Java .class files using a JVM. To register exe with the kernel:\n\nBecome root and turn on the binfmt module in your kernel with this command: \n\n```\nsudo apt-get install binfmt-support\nmodprobe binfmt_misc\n\n```\n\nIn addition, you may want to add the `modprobe` command to your `/etc/rc.local` boot script, so that it will be executed on boot.\n\nAdd the line below to your `/etc/fstab` file: \n\n```\nbinfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc none\n\n```\n\nThen, have your system run the following command on boot: \n\n```\necho ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register\n\n```\n\nBe sure to mark your .exe files as executable in the filesystem as well: \n\n```\nchmod +x myprogram.exe\n\n```\n\nNote that this doesn't change your kernel, just the modules that it loads when you boot your system. In other words, you can still upgrade your kernel without worrying about losing these changes. Similarly, you can upgrade your Mono runtime without affecting any of the invocation methods listed in this section."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to configure a Linux system to automatically run .exe files using Mono without explicitly calling the mono command.

It involves installing binfmt-support, adding the modprobe command to /etc/rc.local for execution on boot, modifying /etc/fstab to mount binfmt_misc, and adding a command to register the .exe file type with binfmt_misc on system startup. This configuration allows the system to recognize .exe files and automatically use Mono to execute them without explicitly calling the mono command.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests installing Wine instead of binfmt-support. Wine is for running Windows applications, not for configuring Mono execution.\n\nOption C is partially correct but suggests adding the modprobe command to /etc/init.d instead of /etc/rc.local, and incorrectly states that the .exe file type needs to be manually registered after each boot.\n\nOption D is close but incorrectly suggests modifying /etc/modules instead of /etc/fstab, which is not the correct approach for this configuration."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/16", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/629784", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/296291/"], "docs_id": 629784, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I came across this formula in thermodynamics.

It subtends a certain angle at your eyes, that is, it has a certain angular extension in your field of view. If you look at the moon through a telescope, the diameter of the virtual image created by the scope is much smaller than the actual diameter of the moon. So how does this help? It helps because the angle subtended by the scope's moon image is greater than that subtended by the moon without the scope. The scope provides angular magnification and that makes the moon look bigger. Angular magnification is used when the image is virtual, as in telescopes, binoculars and microscopes."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is observing the moon through a telescope. The moon's actual diameter is 3,474 km, and it's approximately 384,400 km away from Earth. If the telescope provides an angular magnification of 50x, what is the apparent size of the moon as seen through the telescope compared to its actual size?\n\nA) The moon appears 50 times larger than its actual size\nB) The moon appears 2,500 times larger than its actual size\nC) The moon's apparent size doesn't change, only its angular size increases\nD) The moon appears 50 times closer than it actually is\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe key concept here is understanding the difference between angular magnification and actual size magnification. A telescope provides angular magnification, which means it increases the angle subtended by an object in the observer's field of view. This makes the object appear larger or closer, but it doesn't change the object's actual size or distance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the angular size increases by 50 times, this doesn't translate directly to apparent size.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it squares the magnification, which is not how angular magnification works.\n\nOption C is correct. The telescope increases the angular size of the moon in the observer's field of view, making it appear larger or more detailed, but it doesn't change the moon's apparent physical size. The moon still appears to be 3,474 km in diameter, just with more visible detail.\n\nOption D is a common misconception. While the moon may appear closer due to the increased angular size, its apparent distance doesn't actually change by a factor of 50.\n\nThis question tests understanding of angular magnification, the difference between apparent and actual size, and the principles of how telescopes work."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/15", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/42964", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/14782/"], "docs_id": 42964, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am thinking of installing Ubuntu Server then from there install a desktop environment.

HTML and web\\-pages were still germinal. Google wouldn't have had anything to search, had it existed. Nowadays Google is an incredibly convenient way of finding almost anything \\-\\- not just solutions to mathematics problems, but even friends you lost track of 20\\+ years ago. \n\nMy question concerns how Google (and to a lesser extent other technological advances) has changed the landscape for you. Specifically, when you're teaching proofs. More details on what I'm getting at:\n\nA \"rite of passage\" homework problem in the 2nd year multi\\-variable calc/analysis course at the University Alberta was the Cantor\\-Schroeder\\-Bernstein theorem. In the 3rd year there was the Kuratowski closure/14\\-set theorem. It's not very useful to ask students to prove such theorems on homework assignments nowadays, since the \"pull\" of Google is too strong. They easily find proofs of these theorems *even if they're not deliberately searching for them*. The reason I value these \"named\" traditional problems is primarily that they are fairly significant problems where a student, after they've completed the problem, can look back and know they've proven (on their own) some kind structural theorem \\- they know they're not just proving meaningless little lemmas, as the theorems have historical significance. As these kinds of accomplishments accumulate, students observe they've learned to some extent how an area develops and what it takes in terms of contributions of new ideas, dogged deduction, and so on. \n\nI'm curious to what extent you've adapted to this new dynamic. I have certainly noticed students being able to look\\-up not just named theorems but also relatively simple, arbitrary problems. After all, even if you create a problem that you think is novel, it's rather unlikely that this is the case \\- sometimes students find your problem on a 3\\-year\\-old homework assignment on a course webpage half\\-way around the planet, even if it's new to you. \n\nAs Jim Conant mentioned in the comments, this is a relatively new thing. When I was an undergraduate, going to the library meant a 30\\-minute walk each way, then the decision process of trying to figure out what textbook to look in, frequently a long search that led me to learning something interesting that I hadn't planned on, and frequently not finding what I set out to find. But type in part of your problem into Google and it brings you to the exact line of all the textbooks in which it appears. It brings up all the home\\-pages where the problem appears and frequently solutions keys, if not Wikipedia pages on the problem \\-\\- I've deleted more than one Wikipedia page devoted to solutions to particular homework problems.\n\nOf course there are direct ways to adapt: asking relatively obscure questions. And there's \"denying the problem\" \\- the idea that good students won't (deliberately or accidentally) look up solutions. IMO this underestimates how easy it is to find solutions nowadays. And it underestimates how diligent students have to be in order to succeed in mathematics. \n\nAny insights welcome. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How would you teach anything in an age when the \"arcana\" or guild secrets had been made public? Well, you would *teach*. And you would not ask questions that had answers that could be called \"answers\" on the basis of some look\\-up.\n\nI'm not involved in such things these days, but when I was, I wrote my own questions for students. I did not expect to take questions down off the shelf from anywhere, and for that reason my questions perhaps had a few rough edges. But then I was in an institution that actually thought teaching quite demanding.\n\nIt is an answer, though it probably betrays a lack of sympathy: if you don't want students simply to look up the answer, don't simply look up the question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of teaching mathematics in the age of easily accessible information, which approach is most likely to effectively challenge students while minimizing the risk of them simply looking up answers online?\n\nA) Assigning well-known theorems like the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem as homework problems\nB) Using traditional textbook problems that have been used for many years\nC) Creating novel, custom-designed problems specific to your course and students\nD) Relying on obscure mathematical puzzles from rare sources\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is to create novel, custom-designed problems specific to your course and students.

Particular programming language will depend on the toll/application stack but you will be required to write code. \n\nAs for xUnit frameworks, probably you won't write unit test (as mentioned dev job), but it is possible you will be using them as *runner* for your tests. For example Selenium that was mentioned here doesn't require coding skills if you use SeleniumIDE which is only one of products. If you use SeleniumCore \\- than you are using api that wraps around browser. In this case you write code that will perform tests on given application. And if you put this code into xUnit framework you will have runner, reports with it. \n\nAs for mock objects you will be using them in very rare situations. Maybe when you will be building automation framework for your app. But depending on the approach you can skip it. \n\n**EDIT**\nAs per new answers and edit of the main question.\nI agree with c\\_maker \\- you probably won't be writing unit tests for application code, but it is possible to write unit tests for your automation framework software is software iven if it is software testing other software.

The '&&' ensures that subsequent commands only run if the previous one was successful.\nC) This is similar to B, but uses ';' instead of '&&'. While it would run the script 3 times, it doesn't ensure that each execution is successful before proceeding to the next.\nD) This would run the script every 20 minutes (at 0, 20, and 40 minutes past each hour), not 3 times per minute."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/04/10", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/129578", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 129578, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a bazillion hard disk encryption HOWTOs, but somehow I can't find one that actually does what I want.

I want to setup encryption for home dirs on the NAS so that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the boot process (since the NAS it tucked away in a cupboard),\n* the home dirs should be accessible as a regular file system on the client(s) (e.g. via SMB),\n* it is easy to use by 'normal' people, (so it does not require SSH\\-ing to the NAS, mount the encrypted partition on command line, then connecting via SMB, and finally umount the partition after being done.

The idea was that on connecting to the SMB server, I'd have to enter the password on the client, which sends it to the server for authentication, which would use the password to mount the encrpytion partition, and would unmount it again when the session was closed. Turns out that doesn't really work, because SMB does not transmit the password in the plain and hence I can't configure PAM to use the incoming password to mount the encrypted patition.\n\nSo... anything I'm overlooking?

The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: `DenyUsers`, `AllowUsers`, `DenyGroups`, and finally `AllowGroups`.\n\nEdit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, and add this to the bottom of it:\n\n```\nAllowUsers git adam@192.168.0.* bob@192.168.0.* cliff@192.168.0.* david@192.168.0.*\n\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work (and this way might actually be cleaner) [you can use the `Match` option](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Limit_access_to_openssh_features_with_the_Match_keyword.html) together with `AllowUsers`:\n\n```\n# This is the default setting (only allow GIT access)\nAllowUsers git \n\n# This is the setting that is ONLY available if you are SSHing from the LAN (allow the listed users)\nMatch Address 192.168.0.*\n    AllowUsers git adam bob cliff dave\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are configuring SSH access for a server that hosts both Git repositories and a Redmine web interface. You want to allow Git access from anywhere, but restrict SSH access to only the local network (192.168.0.0/24) for specific users. Which of the following configurations in /etc/ssh/sshd_config would achieve this goal?\n\nA) AllowUsers git adam bob cliff dave\n\nB) Match Address 192.168.0.*\n       AllowUsers git adam bob cliff dave\n\nC) AllowUsers git\n   Match Address 192.168.0.*\n       AllowUsers adam bob cliff dave\n\nD) AllowUsers git\n   Match Address 192.168.0.*\n       AllowUsers git adam bob cliff dave\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct configuration to achieve the desired access control. Here's why:\n\n1. The first line \"AllowUsers git\" allows the Git user to access SSH from any IP address, which is necessary for Git repository access from anywhere.\n\n2. The \"Match Address 192.168.0.*\" block applies the following rules only to connections from the 192.168.0.0/24 network.\n\n3. Within this block, \"AllowUsers adam bob cliff dave\" permits only these specific users to access SSH from the local network.\n\nThis configuration ensures that Git access is available from anywhere, while SSH access for administrators is restricted to the local network only.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would allow all listed users from any IP address.\nOption B is incorrect because it restricts Git access to the local network only.\nOption D is incorrect because it includes the Git user in both the global and local network allowed users, which is redundant and could potentially cause confusion."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/07", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/184860", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/84736/"], "docs_id": 184860, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I saw the sentence \u201cCheck out my social media feeds.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s that mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a distinction between a door (restaurant, opening or similar) **to** another world and one **in** another world.\n\nThe preposition **to** indicates that the place or object concerned serves to transport a person from one world to another. It's like a bridge. The visitor enters from a particular world and is transported metaphorically into a different world \\- one that is more beautiful or strange or mysterious or whatever. \n\nIn this sense, diving equipment transports a diver from a land world to a sea world by allowing the diver to explore the world under the water.\n\nThe preposition **in** indicates that the door is already to be found in a different world and allows a visitor to enter (or leave) the venue concerned in that particular world \\- but not to leave the world itself.\n\nSo I might say that:\n\n> Explorers found a hidden door **to** the tomb of a pharaoh\n\nindicating that the door enabled them to enter the tomb of the pharaoh from a passage or point outside the tomb.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n> Explorers found a hidden door **in** the tomb of the pharaoh\n\nindicates that they were already inside the tomb when they discovered a door that led elsewhere.\n\nThus in your example a door **to** another world suggests that the restaurant offers diners an experience that is totally new to them. A door **in** another world would suggest that they were already in the other world when they came across a door that led elsewhere within this world. This is not the idea that the restaurateurs wish to convey."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of describing fictional or metaphorical portals, which statement best explains the difference between \"a door to another world\" and \"a door in another world\"?\n\nA) \"A door to another world\" implies the door is physically located in the other world, while \"a door in another world\" suggests it leads to that world.\n\nB) \"A door to another world\" indicates a transformative experience or passage between realms, while \"a door in another world\" describes an entrance already situated within that alternate realm.\n\nC) There is no significant difference; both phrases can be used interchangeably to describe magical or fantastical entrances.\n\nD) \"A door to another world\" is used for fictional settings, while \"a door in another world\" is preferred in travel writing about exotic locations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the distinction explained in the documentation. \"A door to another world\" implies a transformative passage or experience that transports someone from one realm to another, like a bridge between worlds. In contrast, \"a door in another world\" describes an entrance that already exists within the alternate realm, allowing movement within that world but not necessarily between different worlds. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nuanced use of prepositions in describing fictional or metaphorical portals."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/05", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/797", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/7/"], "docs_id": 797, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I kept a listing of virtual globes in 2005 and 2006, but it's now woefully out of date [http://geography2\\.blogspot.com/2005/11/listing\\-of\\-virtual\\-globes.html](http://geography2.blogspot.com/2005/11/listing-of-virtual-globes.html).
