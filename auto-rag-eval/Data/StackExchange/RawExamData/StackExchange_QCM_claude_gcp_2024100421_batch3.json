I have searched quite a few places and I just can not find any benchmarks showing the difference of virtualisation bit enabled/disabled on the same hardware. Does anyone have any benchmarks they have seen that they can share?\n\nIn addition, I know there was an uproar a while ago as Sony disable the hardware virtualisation on some models and only offer it in their higher models as a premium feature, however, apart from forcing an up\\-sell, are there any benefits to having it disabled e.g. battery/heat? I just can't find any information and can't work out why it would be disabled by default.\n\nEdit\\-\\-\\-\n\nTo add, The only thing I can find is that without it, you can not perform x64 virtualisation as fast. This is the only down side I can find. However, if this is the only difference, then I am still interested in the second part of the question \\- why offer the option to disable it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's actually a pretty [good answer to \"Are there any benchmarks for virtual machines with and without VT\\-x?](https://serverfault.com/questions/17965/are-there-any-benchmarks-for-virtual-machines-with-and-without-vt-x/25314#25314) over on Server Fault. Even though the answer is about a year and half old it is still reasonable. The takeaway regarding performance is \"it depends\" in general AMD\\-V and Intel VTx do increase stability and ease development of virtual machines.\n\nAs for why the option to disable it. Some processors don't support hardware virtualization and some BIOSes when combined with those processors don't report that correctly. The ability to specifically turn off the hardware virtualization is a plus in those instances. There are probably also some concerns about stability. It is a newer technology, if a stability or performance bug crops up it's easier to tell people to disable virtualization in the BIOS then to tell everyone to update their BIOS to a version that allows them to turn it off. Finally, it's probably also there for testing. It's easier to turn things on and off in the BIOS when testing your motherboard for stability and performance with random different configurations than it is to rebuild the BIOS and load it on to test it with and without any set of features."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements best describes the impact of enabling hardware virtualization on system performance and the reasons for having the option to disable it?\n\nA) Enabling hardware virtualization always results in significant performance improvements, and the option to disable it exists solely for compatibility with older processors.\n\nB) The performance impact of enabling hardware virtualization varies depending on the specific use case, and the option to disable it is primarily for testing and troubleshooting purposes.\n\nC) Enabling hardware virtualization only affects x64 virtualization speed, and the option to disable it is offered as a premium feature by some manufacturers.\n\nD) Hardware virtualization has no impact on performance, and the option to disable it is provided to improve battery life and reduce heat generation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation indicates that the performance impact of hardware virtualization \"depends\" on the specific use case, with the main benefits being increased stability and easier development of virtual machines. The option to disable hardware virtualization is provided for several reasons, including compatibility with processors that don't support it, addressing potential stability issues, and facilitating testing of different configurations. Options A and D are incorrect as they make absolute claims about performance impact that are not supported by the given information. Option C is partially correct about x64 virtualization but misrepresents the reason for the disable option."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/06/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/29499", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/5869/"], "docs_id": 29499, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Okay, so I know MO has had a recent proliferation of this kind of question, and I know MO is not really *for* this type of question (though I suspect perhaps this is a phenomenon that is likely to repeat toward the end of every academic year...)\\- nonetheless I find myself cap in hand and hoping for some guidance.\n\n### Background\n\n**I wasted my undergraduate degree:** following a fairly successful first year and an interest in pretty pictures, I found myself digging around in the region of complex dynamics and fell for it hard. As first loves go it was a great one\\- I swooned over Montel's theorem and cooed over the simple presentations of iterative dynamics gleaned from the uniformization theorem\\- but like all first loves; the detail of the thing did not surpass the idea, and pretty soon it had to end. I was disillusioned and reluctant to look for more fish in the sea\\- my work ethic dropped to zero.\n\n**I fell in love again:** but too late\\- algebraic topology/ differential geometry hit me in my fourth year like a simplicial arrow from cupid's own bow but by this time, my grades blew and all the people I knew in the department were DS theorists. I got a 2:1 (for all you non\\-UK MOers\\- it's a degree class that's basically a rubber stamp with the word 'mediocre' on it).\n\n**I tried teaching school kids:** not enough cohomology.\n\n**I've got myself a year, a jolly good library and a lot of determination:** My aim being to produce something so intriguing/charming/advanced that someone will give me funding to do pure maths.\n\n### Question\n\n> So what, if anything, should I try to produce?\n\n**Specifically:** Would I have to solve some grand unsolved problem? Would I get by with just a small one? If so, where would I find it? Perhaps even a complete set of excercises from an advanced book? A digest paper on a difficult topic? \\[If it helps my research interests are differential geometry, differential topology and gauge theory\\- but I'm flexible]\n\n**I am aware:** That the above situation is my fault\\- and I would be grateful if you were restrained in your remonstrations. That the question, as stated, is highly subjective\\- but the *opinions* of research mathematicians is precisely what I am trying to gauge. That the answer may simply be: 'try some less prestigious universities'\\- in which case, fair enough\\- but I don't want to rule anything out just yet.\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can spare.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I sympathize with your case. A 2\\.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption.\n\nTaking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of \"intriguing/charming/advanced\" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by [Terry Tao.](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)\n\nThere is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community.\n\nThere are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues. Good luck."}, "answer": "Question: Based on the advice given in the top answer, what is the most recommended approach for the student to pursue graduate studies in mathematics?\n\nA) Attempt to solve a grand unsolved mathematical problem independently\nB) Complete all exercises from an advanced mathematics textbook\nC) Write a digest paper on a difficult mathematical topic\nD) Contact professors to seek unofficial research opportunities\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The top answer advises against trying to solve big unsolved problems independently or locking oneself in a library, as these approaches are unlikely to produce meaningful results or impress graduate admissions committees. Instead, the recommended approach is to contact many professors in areas of interest, offering to work as an unofficial research student. This strategy has several advantages:\n\n1. It provides guided research experience, which is more valuable than independent study.\n2. It allows the student to make connections with established academics.\n3. It can lead to strong letters of recommendation, which are crucial for graduate admissions.\n4.

The caret package does indeed tune both alpha and lambda parameters for the glmnet model. However, as seen in the training log example provided, lambda values may appear as NA. This is because the glmnet algorithm internally handles lambda values efficiently, allowing for predictions across different lambda values using predict.glmnet after the model is trained. The NA in the log doesn't mean lambda isn't being tuned, but rather that its specific value isn't displayed in that particular output format. Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent how caret handles the parameters. Option D is incorrect because while you can specify a tuning grid, it's not required to have separate grids for alpha and lambda; they can be combined in a single expand.grid as shown in the example code."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/18", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/49173", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/16202/"], "docs_id": 49173, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am making a project of noise cancellation using least mean sqaure algorithms through microcontroller. In that I need two signals to implement LMS algorithm i.e noisy and noise\\+clean. So my question is how can i sample these signals simultaneously? Is there any way to sample both signals at the same time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tell us more about your signals. If they're slow enough, you may be able to get away with using on the onboard ADC. You didn't say which AVR model you're using, but most AVRs I've used had a maximum sampling frequency of around 4kHz. If you need to sample two signals with it, the ADC is multiplexed, so cut that in half. Unless your signals are significantly slower than that (and without trying it, I would guess a factor of 10 would be pushing it), I would go with a two\\-channel external ADC. The goal is to sample fast enough that relative to the slower signal, the samples were taken at approximately the same time. The multiplexer in the onboard and some external ADCs will take some finite time to switch. This needs to be considered. The uC clock also needs to be running fast enough that it can complete the necessary math before the next samples."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a noise cancellation project using the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm on a microcontroller, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the simultaneous sampling of noisy and noise+clean signals?\n\nA) The onboard ADC of most AVR microcontrollers can easily handle simultaneous sampling of both signals at any frequency.\n\nB) An external two-channel ADC is always required, regardless of the signal frequency.\n\nC) The onboard ADC can be used for simultaneous sampling if the signals are significantly slower than the ADC's maximum sampling frequency, typically by a factor of about 10.\n\nD) The onboard ADC of AVR microcontrollers can reliably sample two signals at up to 4kHz each without any limitations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation suggests that the onboard ADC of most AVR microcontrollers has a maximum sampling frequency of around 4kHz. When sampling two signals, this frequency is effectively halved due to multiplexing. To ensure reliable sampling that appears simultaneous relative to the slower signal, the signals should be significantly slower than the ADC's capability - the documentation suggests a factor of about 10 would be pushing it. This means the onboard ADC could potentially handle simultaneous sampling if the signals are slow enough, typically around 200Hz or less. For faster signals, an external two-channel ADC would be recommended. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the capability of the onboard ADC. Option B is too absolute, as the onboard ADC can be used in some cases. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the halving of the sampling rate when dealing with two signals and ignores the limitations mentioned in the documentation."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/09", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503576", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/193802/"], "docs_id": 503576, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not able to reproduce the following image with tikz:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqReA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqReA.png)\n\nI am able to draw each single tree, but I have no idea how to combine them to get the image shown above. \n\nHow do you arrange them? \nHow do you add arrows and texts?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBelow you find the code that I wrote for the tree of the first two line of the image.\n\nPS: is forest the right package to do this?\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}\n\\usepackage[linguistics]{forest}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{forest}\n  [\n    4 \n    [3\n        [2]\n        [1]\n    ]\n    [5\n        [6]\n    ]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    4 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [1]\n        ]\n        [5\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    5 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [1]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    1 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    1 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    4 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [1\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using Ti*K*z `pic` definition and `matrix` library.

Also, `A./B` occurs twice and could be done with a single AND.\n\nIf you're implementing in gates, you can pretty much directly convert to logic as shown in the circuit below. You may well find that some terms can be optimised because they are shared between segments: for example, I've shared `/A`, `/B` etc, but you can find shared terms after the AND gates. (NB: following is for common cathode seven\\-segment display, common anode would be similar but with some logic reversal, as you generate `/outa` etc, not `outa`.)

They have correctly derived Boolean equations for each segment (a-g) based on 4 input bits (A, B, C, D). However, they are struggling to implement the full circuit. Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the proper implementation of this 7-segment display decoder?\n\nA) Each segment's logic circuit should have its own separate set of input pins for A, B, C, and D.\n\nB) The input pins A, B, C, and D should be connected to all segment logic circuits in parallel, ensuring they all receive the same input.\n\nC) Only segments that are used for displaying digits 0-9 need to be connected to the input pins, as letters A-F are rarely used.\n\nD) The segments should be daisy-chained, with the output of one segment's logic becoming the input for the next segment's logic circuit.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct implementation requires all segment logic circuits (a-g) to share the same input signals (A, B, C, D). This ensures that each segment responds to the same input combination, producing a coherent display. Option A would result in independent and likely incorrect segment behaviors. Option C is incorrect as all segments are needed for full hexadecimal display. Option D describes an invalid configuration that would not produce the desired output. The parallel connection described in option B allows each segment's logic to evaluate the same input, resulting in the correct display for each hexadecimal digit."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/10/31", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1497945", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/1073686/"], "docs_id": 1497945, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can somebody give me a one liner ssh command which can connect to remote host through bastion host (jump host).

\"bastion\" server. You cannot verify it, when the connection is created using `ProxyCommand` directive.\n\nAs you are using OpenSSH 8\\.1, you can use [`-J` (jump) switch](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh#J), instead of `ProxyCommand` directive:\n\n```\nssh -i remote.pem -i bastion.pem -J user@bastion user@remote\n\n```\n\nSee also [Does OpenSSH support multihop login?](https://superuser.com/q/1488097/213663)\n\nWith the `-J` switch, you should get a normal host key verification prompt.\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, first connect to the \"bastion\" only to verify its host key:\n\n```\nssh user@bastion\n\n```\n\n---\n\nAs you use `ssh` in some isolated non\\-interactive environment, you will have to copy the `known_hosts` file created by the above commands to that environment.\n\nOr use some techniques hinted in [ssh command line specify server host key fingerprint](https://serverfault.com/q/678035/168875)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: You need to connect to a remote host through a bastion (jump) host using SSH.

When an action triggers a success message (or any other type of message like error, notice, or warning), it's added to the session. When any admin page is viewed, Magento checks the session for messages, displays them, and then removes them from the session. \n\nIf you perform an action on one page that adds a message to the session, but quickly refresh another admin page before the first page completes its refresh, the message will appear on the second page. This happens because the message is already in the session, waiting to be displayed and cleared. The system doesn't distinguish which page should display the message; it simply shows any pending messages on the next page load.\n\nThis behavior can sometimes lead to confusing situations, such as seeing a cache refresh success message on the Orders page, as described in the example.

On sites with a similar age and questions\\-per\\-day turnover as Tex.SE such as [Physics](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) and [Electrical Engineering](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all), the top two rows of users have much less reputation than here. You have to go to [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) to find something comparable, among sites with a similar age, but they're churning through something like seven times as many questions as here.\n\nOf course, it's quite possible that in terms of total amounts of reputation things are a bit more in line, but there I don't quite have the statistics chops to make a meaningful comparison. Either way, TeX.SE must either have (a) much more rep (hence also votes) to go around as other comparable sites, or (b) a much more skewed rep distribution curve. [This query](http://data.stackexchange.com/tex/query/206518/reputation-histogram-log-log-scale#graph) sort of vaguely supports the latter but then again you'd have to be quite careful with your comparisons.\n\nFor now, though, I want to ask this community what you think this says about this site. Does this strike you as a reasonable observation? What would you attribute it to?\n\n---\n\nEdit:\n\nThere's a strong emphasis in the responses on the total number of votes, and I don't think I quite buy it. It is [very easy](http://data.stackexchange.com/superuser/query/492368/total-upvotes-and-downvotes) to query for the total upvotes and downvotes in a site, and the data isn't at all unambiguous. For the comparisons above, it currently looks like this:\n\n```\n        TeX.SE   Super User   Server Fault   Physics        EE    Mathematics\n  \u2191  1,440,460    1,964,282      1,261,362   575,663   466,268      3,511,289\n  \u2193     17,360      254,889        168,570    91,254    78,871        380,931\n\n```\n\nFrom this, there's a few points worth emphasizing:\n\n* Compared to sites equivalent in age and current turnover, Physics and Electrical Engineering, TeX.SE does have way more upvotes around.\n* Similarly, the downvote count does seem rather low compared to everyone else.\n* However, SuperUser has a lot less rep on the top pages than TeX.SE... but it still has sizably more upvotes in the database.\n* The site with a comparable leaderboard, Mathematics, has more than twice the total rep.\n* While SU and SF do have more downvotes than TeX.SE, the negative effect of downvotes on rep is 1/5th of an upvote, and the count of (upvotes \\- 0\\.2 downvotes) for SU is still higher than the total upvotes of TeX.SE.\n* That means that explanations along the lines of \"we don't downvote\" that don't address that ratio have rather low explanatory power.\n\nFor me, that says that there also needs to be more concentration of rep on the top tiers, which ties in with (and provides evidence for) [Should high\\-rep users hang back a little?](https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1867/should-high-rep-users-hang-back-a-little).\n\nAlso, just to be clear,\n\n* Yes, rep is just fake internet points and ultimately doesn't matter. However, metrics like these do carry a nontrivial amount of information about each community and they are a reflection of the informal culture in the group.\n* Along similar lines, most of the comments saying 'it doesn't matter' and the like seem to come mostly from people whose experience on the SE network is here or on StackOverflow, and who may not be in a position to see just how crazy\\-high that rep board looks like. Trust me \\- it's anomalously high, and very much so. Hence this question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Several reasons:\n\n1. We vote a lot, and we vote up.\n2.

In a (40\\-mile / week) training schedule, much of those miles will be \"jogging\".\n\nWhen \"running\" people often record their pace / distance / cadence with a run tracker app. They analyze this later so they can adjust their training plan.\n\nFinally, when you do \"*run*\" it typically goes like this:  \n\n(stretch) \\-\\-\\> (a little jogging) \\-\\-\\> (run!) \\-\\-\\> (a little jogging) \\-\\-\\> (stretch)\n\nps: I am a runner (and jogger)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the difference between jogging and running according to the information provided?\n\nA) Jogging is always done at speeds below 6 miles per hour, while running is always faster than this.\n\nB) Jogging is primarily for leisure and fitness, while running involves more structured training and pace monitoring.\n\nC) Jogging is best done in the early morning, while running is more suitable for evening or gym sessions.\n\nD) Jogging has a wider lateral spacing of foot strikes, making it impossible to transition to running within the same exercise session.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The information provided suggests that jogging is generally seen as a more leisurely activity aimed at fitness and exercise, without much focus on pace or performance metrics. Running, on the other hand, is described as involving more structured training, often including the use of tracking apps to monitor pace, distance, and cadence for later analysis and training plan adjustments. While some sources attempt to define jogging based on speed or foot strike patterns, the most consistent distinction in the given information is the purpose and approach to the activity, with jogging being more casual and running being more performance-oriented."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/26", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/143611", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/9162/"], "docs_id": 143611, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm analyzing a 2\u00d72 contingency table, and am required to a report a 95% CI on the Odds Ratio.\n\nIs there any point in prefacing this with a Chi Square Test of Independence?

How do I interpret it? I assume that if lower bound of interval is higher than 0\\.5 then I can conclude that my model is better than random one. What confuses me is that $AUC$ is in the middle of interval so it will always be inside CI. I think that maybe if my model was applied to some different observation, I would be 95% sure that its $AUC$ fit into CI. Am I right?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confidence interval is an interval\\-estimate for some true value of a parameter. Let us (as an example) start with e.g. a confidence interval for the mean of a normal distribution and then move on to ROC and AUC so that one sees the analogy. \n\nAssume that you have a random normal variable $X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu;\\\\sigma)$. Where $\\\\mu$ is the **unknown** population mean and, to keep it simple, let us assume that $\\\\sigma$ is known. \n\nWe now draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of X, i.e. we get a sample $x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\dots x\\_n$. The goal is to have an idea about the unknown $\\\\mu$ using the sample drawn. It is well known that the arithemetic average $\\\\bar{x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_i x\\_i$ is an unbiased (point) estimator for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$ and that $\\[\\\\bar{x}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{x}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$ is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$. \n\nIf we draw another sample $y\\_1, \\\\dots , y\\_n$ from the distribtion of $X$ then, in the same way we will find **another** confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ as $\\[\\\\bar{y}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{y}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$. \n\nSo each time we draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, we find a confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ and all these intervals will be different. **The fact that it is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval means that, if we draw an 'infinite' number of samples of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, and for each of these samples we compute the $95\\\\%$ confidence interval, then $95\\\\%$ of all these intervals (one interval for each sample) will contain the unknown $\\\\mu$.** (so sometimes , namely $5\\\\%$ of the intervals, such an interval will not contain the unknown $\\\\mu$, so sometimes you have bad luck.)\n\nThe same holds for the AUC, when you compute the AUC, you compute it from a sample, in other words what you compute is an estimate for the **true *unknown* AUC**. Similarly you can, for the sample that you have, compute a confidence interval for the true but unknown AUC. If you were able to draw an infinite number of samples, and for each sample obtained compute the confidence interval for the true AUC, then $95\\\\%$ of these computed intervals would contain the true but unknown AUC. \n\n**Note that the interval is random, because it is computed from a random sample. The true AUC is not random, it is some unknown property of your population.**\n\nUnfortunately you can not draw an infinite number of samples, most of the time you have only one sample, so you will have to do it with one interval, **but you are rather confident** ($95\\\\%$ of the so computed intervals will contain the true unknown AUC) that this interval will contain the true AUC. And yes, if the lower border of the interval is higer than 0\\.5 then **you can be rather confident that** your model is not the random model, but, as above, you may also have had bad luck with the sample."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher has developed a predictive model and calculated its Area Under the Curve (AUC) to be 0.75 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.68, 0.82].

The true population AUC is unknown and fixed, not exactly 0.75.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses the confidence interval with a prediction interval.

What is the definition of an arbitrary sum of ideals? (I.e. arbitrarily infinitely many)\n2. Why is the arbitrary sum of ideals an ideal, but not the arbitrary intersection of ideals?\n\n**My progress so far:**\n\n1. My textbook doesn't have a definition, and I haven't been able to find the definition using Google so far. I have two guesses (i) it is the set of all infinite sums, or (ii) the same as the previous except with the additional condition that cofinitely many summands in each sum be equal to zero. The former seems like the \"natural\" extension of the definition of sum to an arbitrary index set of ideals, but the latter seems like the \"convenient\" definition, and I'm not sure which goal (naturalness or convenience) should take priority.\n2. I would expect that the arbitrary intersection of ideals is an ideal, because the ideal generated by any set is the arbitrary intersection of all ideals containing that set, and the radical of an ideal is the arbitrary intersection of all prime ideals containing the ideal. Meanwhile, it isn't clear to me that the infinite sum of elements of a ring should even be defined. Usually one has that the product of ideals is included in the intersection, and that usually only the finite product of ideals is an ideal, so in the exceptional cases where the product of ideals equals the intersection of ideals, I can somewhat see how the intersection wouldn't be an ideal. But there are at least two problems with this: if only the finite product of ideals is an ideal, then why isn't the same true for sums of ideals? Why is the multiplication operation in the ring being given a privileged position compared to the addition operation? Second, if the product of ideals equals the intersection of ideals in a certain ring, then why doesn't that just allow one to define arbitrary products of ideals, instead of making it impossible to define anything besides finite intersections of ideals? It seems clear to me that I am fundamentally misunderstanding some aspect of the operations (addition, multiplication, intersections) of ideals.\n\n**EDIT:** <http://planetmath.org/sumofideals> Planetmath says that \"the sum of ideals is the smallest ideal of the ring containing all of those ideals\". So I guess my question could be thought of as \\-\\- why isn't the intersection of ideals the smallest ideal of the ring containing all of those ideals? For every other object I know of which is closed under intersections, it is the intersection which has this property. Do the sum and intersection coincide in some sense?\n\n**Note:** This question is so I can show that the Zariski topology on Spec(R) for a commutative ring with unit is a topology \\-\\- I have already shown that finite unions and intersections of Zariski closed sets are Zariski closed, see [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1981151/327486), so now the question is how to proceed to the general case. In the finite case, the union of Zariski closed sets corresponds to the intersection of ideals, while the intersection of Zariski closed sets corresponds to the sum of ideals. I would expect the intersection of ideals to be arbitrarily extensible, and the sums to be only finitely defined, but that would make the Zariski closed sets the open sets of a topology, which is clearly incorrect.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let $(I\\_j)\\_{j\\\\in J}$ be a family of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.

To allow debugging, I use a functional model written in Verilog. In it, the setup and hold time for some signal is set to 1\\.5 ns. If I understand everything correctly, this means that the signal can not change 'within' 1\\.5 ns of a rising clock edge.\n\nHowever, the RTL that I've written does not include timing, so the signal appears to change instantly, yielding hold time warnings.\n\nOn the one hand, I am not too concerned; I'm only getting warnings, and I think that during a project for my university, we were told to simply ignore these errors.\n\nOn the other, I don't like to ignore warnings.

You can no longer do accurate timing analysis with RTL code.\n\nSome models are written to be used in both RTL and structural simulations, so you can ignore these warnings.

RTL code does not include detailed timing information, as it represents the design at a higher level of abstraction. The actual device and routing delays, which are crucial for accurate timing analysis, are only available after the design has been placed and routed on the FPGA. Therefore, timing warnings during RTL simulation are often ignored or disabled to improve simulation performance, as they don't provide accurate timing information at this stage of the design process.

On the primary side on the main transformer, I have a 15V rail to power the control chip (a FAN6920\\) and a gate drive chip (a FAN7382\\). On this 15V rail, I have roughly 400uF of capacitance. Because of this amount of capacitance, the hiccup time of the supply is about 10 sec. That's the time it take for the 15V rail to decay down to about 5V, at which point the control chip will attempt to start back up. This is acceptable during an actual fault (e.g. an over voltage condition on the output or the output shorted), but this hiccup time is also present when turning the line off and then back on within that 10 seconds. The supply is used to power lights, so as you can imagine, no one wants a potential 10 second delay when they hit the light switch.\n\nTo that end, I'm trying to figure out a way to design a circuit that senses whether the AC line has gone away, and if so, to pull down the 15V rail quickly, while at the same time not impacting steady state operation. \n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/llXvu.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fllXvu.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nMy first attempt at this is above. This idea is that C1 will charge to 10V when the line voltage is applied, holding M2 on. Holding M2 on will hold M1 off. At the same time, C2 is charging to 10V. When the line voltage is disconnected, C1 discharges much quicker than C2, allowing M2 to open up, and allowing C2 to change the gate of M1, turning it on and rapidly discharging the 15V rail through a 10 ohm resistor. However, in practice, C1 doesn't discharge nearly quick enough. It maintains enough voltage to keep M2 on for several seconds, so it doesn't really buy me anything (and also, the charge of C2 decays enough that it can't turn M1 on at that point, anyway). I can't change the time constant of C1 and R2 by much because the voltage across C1 will start drooping significantly when the line crosses 0V.\n\nI am not tied to this topology by any means; this was just my first pass at a solution.

The management app uploads to fs1 server (could be either fs1 or fs2\\)\n2. fs1 notifies fs2 and the management app when upload is complete\n3. fs2 contacts fs1 and stores a copy of the file\n4. fs2 notifies the management app when upload is complete\n5. The management app saves metadata to the external database\n6. both fs1 and fs2 can now server the files when requested\n\nThis seems OK, if there are only two instances, but once you start adding more it doesn't work.  \n\nOur ops department are very much against the idea of using the database to store files. They are worried that it will slow down the system too much. I agree it might, which is why I want a separate database for the specific purpose of storing the files and metadata. \nI want to build something like the following:  \n\n[![system diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ox6r9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ox6r9.png)\n\nMy thinking is that the upload service can manage uploading of files and saving of metadata to the database. \nWhen the scheduler schedules a new job, the upload service (badly named, I know, but I'm not making that image again :\\-) ) can notify the file server instances that they need to cache the required file(s) from the database, which they can access directly.  \n\nThe file servers won't need to cache more than 5 or 6 files each at a time.  \n\nAlso, in the diagram I missed that the file management service will receive download progress messages from both file servers. \n\nSo to my questions: \n\n1. Is this a reasonable way to store files of this size for serving?\n2. Is this the right way to be thinking when considering the move to microservices in the future?\n3. Are there advantages to storing the files on the file system of each fs instance instead of just caching?\n4. How can I convince our ops team that storing 50MB files in a database is the way to go? what are the pros and cons?\n5. Any other thoughts or comments appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: NO, don't store files in a relational database\n==============================================\n\n*Trust me, I've learned this the **hard way***. One problem with applications that deal with files, is as they evolve, the users always want to store more than the application was intended to handle.\n\nI once created an application with a document storage component meant to store Word and Excel documents. The storage component was useful enough that eventually people started storing **videos** in it.\n\nI mention this because, the performance implications will be higher than you expect; this leads me to my next point.\n\nEven if a database can handle files fine (filestream type) scaling a DB is hard, it is always the hardest part to scale. Let the db concentrate on saving and retrieving data, that way you can put off scaling it as long as possible. If your DB is busy serving a large file, those are resources not being used to serve transaction and lookup requests; its bread and butter.\n\nServer to Server synchronization does not scale well\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nYour system seems over\\-complicated to me, I would go with a simpler design. The problem with servers fs1 and fs2 talking to each other is, as you scale, the number of paths increases exponentially.\n\nWith two servers, each server only has to ask make one synch request, for a total of 2 paths. 3 severs, there are a total of 6\\. With 5 servers there are 20\\.\n`synchRequests = (n-1)*(n); n = number of servers`\n\nI would simply have a dedicated DB server, and a dedicated File server that the FSn servers talk to to.

In practice this is probably more or less equivalent to asking for theorems about integers unprovable in EFA.\n\nRelated links:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_conjecture> about Friedman asking a similar question.\n\nBy the way, encoding deep results as Diophantine equations and so on is cheating.

However there is a difference between the two if you do reflection. \n\nExample:\n\n```\npublic class InterfaceTest {\n\n    static interface I {\n        public void doSomething();\n    }\n\n    static class A implements I {\n        public void doSomething() {\n        }    \n    }    \n\n    static class B extends A {   \n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(A.class.getInterfaces().length);\n\n        for (Class i:A.class.getInterfaces()) {\n            System.out.println(i.getName());\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(B.class.getInterfaces().length);\n\n        for (Class i:B.class.getInterfaces()) {\n            System.out.println(i.getName());\n        }\n\n        B b=new B();\n\n        System.out.println(b instanceof I);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis outputs:\n\n> ```\n>  1 \n>  InterfaceTest$I \n>  0 \n>  true\n> \n> ```\n\nSo while b is an instance of I of course, `B.class.getInterfaces()` does not return any. You have to traverse the class hierarchy to find all interfaces that are implemented. \n\nAn example where this is relevant is using JPA AttributeConverters with Hibernate. An attribute converter has to implement the JPA AttributeConverter interface directly at this point, implementing it on a base class does not work. While this is reported as a bug in Hibernate, it still showcases that there are slight differences depending where you implement the interface and the use case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following class hierarchy:\n\n```java\ninterface I { \n    void doSomething();\n}\n\nclass A implements I {\n    public void doSomething() {}\n}\n\nclass B extends A {\n}\n```\n\nWhat will be the output of the following code?\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(B.class.getInterfaces().length);\nSystem.out.println(B.class.getSuperclass().getInterfaces().length);\nSystem.out.println(new B() instanceof I);\n```\n\nA) 0, 1, false\nB) 1, 1, true\nC) 0, 1, true\nD) 1, 0, true\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n- B.class.getInterfaces().length returns 0 because B doesn't directly implement any interfaces.\n- B.class.getSuperclass().getInterfaces().length returns 1 because A (B's superclass) directly implements interface I.\n- new B() instanceof I returns true because B inherits the implementation of I from its superclass A.\n\nThis question tests understanding of interface implementation inheritance, the difference between direct and indirect interface implementation, and how reflection methods like getInterfaces() work in Java."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/26", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/30030", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/13661/"], "docs_id": 30030, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Facts:\n\nBathroom Size: 8 feet \\* 8 feet \\* 10 feet (Height)\n\nPurpose:\n\n(1\\) Increase the Bathroom air freshness during use\n(2\\) Keep the Bathroom dry for the next use\n\nNote: Intermittent Extraction of air is more preferable over Continuous Extraction\n\nAlternative 1:\nInstall two fans\n(1\\) Inlet fan (2\\) Outlet fan\n(Both the fans are of same air flow capacity, installation at same height side by side on a same wall)\n\nAlternative 2:\nInstall only one \n(1\\) Outlet fan\n(With the double air flow capacity the single fan in alternative 1, installation at same height on a same wall )\n\nWhich alternative will be more efficient and beneficial for Bathroom Ventilation?

This approach takes advantage of the fact that moist hot air rises, allowing for more effective removal of humidity and odors. The documentation suggests that a fan sized for a bathroom twice the actual size is ideal. Additionally, placing the fan on the ceiling near the shower source maximizes its effectiveness. This setup, combined with leaving the door or window open during shower use (if possible) and running the fan for twice the duration of the shower, provides the most efficient ventilation solution.

Or any log file that would help track this down?\n\n```\nelmaco:vm thewheat$ date && df -h\nSun  8 Jun 2014 13:31:46 EST\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2   232Gi  232Gi    0Bi   100% 60909230       0  100%   /\ndevfs          205Ki  205Ki    0Bi   100%      708       0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk0s7   136Gi   50Gi   79Gi    39%   251098 8817446    3%   /Volumes/Untitled 1\n\nelmaco:vm thewheat$ date && df -h\nSun  8 Jun 2014 13:34:47 EST\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2   232Gi  232Gi    0Bi   100% 60909230       0  100%   /\ndevfs          205Ki  205Ki    0Bi   100%      708       0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk0s7   136Gi   50Gi   79Gi    39%   251098 8817446    3%   /Volumes/Untitled 1\n\nelmaco:vm thewheat$ date && df -h\nSun  8 Jun 2014 13:36:40 EST\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2   232Gi  226Gi  6.2Gi    98% 59272640 1636590   97%   /\ndevfs          205Ki  205Ki    0Bi   100%      708       0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk0s7   136Gi   50Gi   79Gi    39%   251098 8817446    3%   /Volumes/Untitled 1\n\n```\n\n![Activity Monitor - Memory](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b3RQ0.png)\n![Activity Monitor - Disk](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bdqMr.png)\n\n**Update 2:**\nSo clearing up \\~12GB of drive space managed to resolve the issue (now says 11GB free).

The user mentions having only 1GB free at times, which is extremely low for a 232GB drive. The recommended solution is to free up more space by moving large non-essential files like photos and videos to an external drive, aiming for at least 10-15% free space.

Say that $X$ is amenable (equivalently, that the action is amenable) if there is a $G$\\-fixed point in every affine space over $X$ with an $\\\\alpha$\\-twisted action, where $\\\\alpha$ is a corresponding cocycle.\n\nIf $X$ is an amenable $G$\\-space, it follows more or less from definition that for every compact metric space $Y$ there is an $G$\\-equivariant measurable map $\\\\varphi : X \\\\to M(Y)$, where $M(Y)$ is the collection of probability measures on $Y$.\n\nMy question is \\- is this property equivalent to the above definition of amenable action or strictly weaker?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a sketch of an argument to show these properties are equivalent which is based on the proof of the same property for amenable groups. To see this I will use the fact that an action $G \\\\curvearrowright (X, \\\\mu)$ is amenable if and only if there is a $G$\\-equivariant mean from $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. (A mean in this setting is a positivity preserving map which restricts to the identity on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$.) This is Theorem A (iv) in \"Amenable Actions of Groups\" by Adams, Elliott, Giordano (1994\\) ([http://www.ams.org/mathscinet\\-getitem?mr\\=1250814](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1250814)), which generalizes the case for countable groups established by Proposition 4\\.1 in \"Hyperfinite Factors and Amenable Ergodic Actions\" by Zimmer (1977\\) ([http://www.ams.org/mathscinet\\-getitem?mr\\=470692](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=470692)).\n\n**Theorem**: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable group. Then there exists a $G$\\-equivariant mean from $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$ if and only if for every continuous action of $G$ on a compact metric space $Y$, there exists a $G$\\-equivariant map from $X$ to $M(Y)$.\n\n**Proof**: For the proof I will find it easier to work with function spaces, and so first note that for a compact Hausdorff space $K$, there is a one\\-to\\-one correspondence between (equivalence classes of) Borel maps $\\\\pi: X \\\\to M(K)$ and means $\\\\Phi: L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes C(K) \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. (Here, $\\\\otimes$ is the $C^\\*$\\-tensor product.) This is essentially just the Riesz representation theorem applied to each fiber $K$.\n\nWe now show the \"only if\" direction. If $G \\\\curvearrowright K$ is a continuous action on a compact metric space, by restricting to a closed $G$\\-invariant subset we may assume that $G \\\\curvearrowright K$ has a dense orbit $K \\= \\\\overline{G k}$. We then obtain a $G$\\-equivariant embedding $\\\\rho: C(K) \\\\to C\\_b(G) \\\\subset L^\\\\infty(G)$ by $\\\\rho(f)(g) \\= f(gk)$. Restricting our invariant mean to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes \\\\rho(C(K))$ then gives the result.\n\nThe converse is a bit more involved, but this is well known for the case of amenable groups. The first step is to show that we have an equivariant mean on the space $UC\\_b(G)$ of bounded left uniformly continuous functions. In the case when $G$ is countable we are then done. For the general case we then use an approximate identity for convolution to produce an equivariant mean for $L^\\\\infty(G)$.\n\nTo produce a mean on the space $UC\\_b(G)$ note that for any second countable $G$\\-invariant $C^\\*$\\-subalgebra $A \\\\subset UC\\_b(G)$ we have that the Gelfand spectrum is metrizable, and $G$ acts continuously. Therefore by hypothesis there exists a $G$\\-equivariant mean $\\\\Phi\\_A: L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes A \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. Since $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$ is injective we may then extend $\\\\Phi\\_A$ to a (perhaps no longer $G$\\-equivariant) positivity preserving map $\\\\widetilde{\\\\Phi\\_A} : L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes UC\\_b(G) \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. If we consider the net $\\\\{ \\\\widetilde{\\\\Phi\\_A} \\\\}$ indexed by the set of all second countable $G$\\-invariant $C^\\*$\\-subalgebras $A$, and ordered by inclusion, then we may take an accumulation point $\\\\Phi$ in the topology of point\\-wise weak convergence. Since $\\\\Phi$ is $G$\\-equivariant when restricted to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes A$ for any second countable $C^\\*$\\-subalgebra $A$, it follows that $\\\\Phi$ is $G$\\-equivariant on the whole space.\n\nTo produce a mean on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ we start by taking an approximate identity $\\\\{ \\\\psi\\_n \\\\} \\\\subset C\\_c(G)$. Specifically, we want that each $\\\\psi\\_n \\\\in C\\_c(G)$ is a non\\-negative function, $\\\\\\| \\\\psi\\_n \\\\\\|\\_1 \\= 1$, ${\\\\rm supp}(\\\\psi\\_n) \\\\to \\\\{ e \\\\}$, and $\\\\\\| \\\\psi\\_n \\* \\\\delta\\_g \\- \\\\delta\\_g \\* \\\\psi\\_n \\\\\\|\\_1 \\\\to 0$ for each $g \\\\in G$. If $f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$, then we have $\\\\psi\\_n \\* f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes UC\\_b(G)$ for each $n$ (I'm taking convolution pointwise in $X$), and $\\\\\\| \\\\sigma\\_g(\\\\psi\\_n \\* f) \\- \\\\psi\\_n \\* (\\\\sigma\\_g(f)) \\\\\\|\\_\\\\infty \\\\to 0$ for each $g \\\\in G$, and $f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$. (We denote by $\\\\sigma\\_g$ the action of $G$ on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$.) If we set $\\\\Phi\\_n : L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G) \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$, by $\\\\Phi\\_n( f ) \\= \\\\Phi( \\\\psi\\_n \\* f )$, then it follows that any accumulation point of $\\\\{ \\\\Phi\\_n \\\\}$ gives us a $G$\\-equivariant mean. $\\\\blacksquare$\n\n**Update**:Nicolas Monod pointed out to me that, in my sketch above, the way that I use the approximate identity $\\\\{ \\\\psi\\_n \\\\}$ at the end is not correct.
