Most of my sources seem to equal unstandardized coefficients in multiple regression with the semipartial correlation of that IV with the DV. But one book says there is a slight difference:\n\nboth terms have the same enumerator, but the differ in the denominator: the semipartial correlation coefficient has a quare root in the denominator (sqr(1\\-r\u00b2), but the regression coefficient \u00df has none (1\\-r\u00b2). the author states that the more the predictors correlate, the more will the two values differ.\n\nI could not find this information anywhere else. is this a fact or what should i think of it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While thorough and ultimately correct, the comment of @ttnphns given to the question is slightly misleading in the sense that it focuses on the similarities between the standardized regression coefficient and the partial correlation, while the more obvious comparison would be between standardized regression coefficient and the more closely related *semi*partial correlation \\[but see the thoughtful answer of @ttnphns in response to my post, clarifying his point about partial correlations]. \n\nIndeed, the only difference is that the semipartial takes the square root of the denominator. The result is that the semipartial is bounded between \\-1 and \\+1, while Beta is not.\n\nAside from the algebraic similarities, semipartial correlations are also conceptually closest to regression coefficients. In a regression analysis, we try to measure the unique explanatory power of predictors, i.e. the unique part of the *total* variance of Y that can be explained by X1, controlled for the other X\\-variables. That is, we residualize each X on other predictors to get its unique effect, but we do not residualize Y, as in the partial correlation.\n\nFor an excellent Powerpoint presentation on this topic, see [these slides by Michael Brannick of the University of South Florida](http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/mbrannick/regression/19%20Partial%20and%20Semi.ppt)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In multiple regression analysis, which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between unstandardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlation coefficients?\n\nA) Unstandardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlation coefficients are always identical in multiple regression.\n\nB) The unstandardized regression coefficient has a square root in its denominator, while the semipartial correlation coefficient does not.\n\nC) The semipartial correlation coefficient has a square root in its denominator (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)), while the unstandardized regression coefficient's denominator does not (1-r\u00b2).\n\nD) The semipartial correlation coefficient and unstandardized regression coefficient differ only in their numerators, not in their denominators.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key difference between unstandardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlation coefficients in multiple regression lies in their denominators. The semipartial correlation coefficient includes a square root in its denominator (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)), while the unstandardized regression coefficient does not have this square root (1-r\u00b2). This difference results in the semipartial correlation being bounded between -1 and +1, unlike the unstandardized regression coefficient. The similarity in their numerators and this specific difference in the denominators align with the information provided in the documentation.

It properly constructs the new meta title by adding \"Sell\" at the beginning and \"Here\" at the end of the existing meta title.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the slower `save()` method. Option B is close but incorrectly uses 'meta_description' instead of 'meta_title'.

You need to store the records in a database table within\n>  these 5 minutes.\n\n* First, I'd stream that file because loading up everything in memory may cause a stack overflow\n* Second, inserting data in a batch way\n\nWhat coding strategy would you use to cope with the amount of data and to stay within this short timeframe for each file you receive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bulk Insert Operations are your friend(s).\n\nIf it's a straight insert only (new data only in files) simply bulk insert the data directly to the table. Most databases have utilities to do bulk insert operations, some even expose those libraries to code as well if using command line utilities and batch files seem old fashioned.\n\nIf it's an insert/update/delete type of scenario, bulk insert into a staging table and then use RDMS specific technology to update the target table. \n\nFor example, SQL Server provides a nice [MERGE](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522522(v=sql.105).aspx) command to merge data to a target.\n\nBulk inserting 100,000 records will only take a second or so.

There is also no \"in operando\" page on Wiktionary, only [\"operando\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/operando).

(Magistri, please correct any dubious details in the comments!)\n\nOperando is a gerund, i.e., a verbal noun, recognizable by its form. Gerunds often get translated into English with \"\\-ing\" gerunds, in this case \"operating\" or \"running\".\n\nThe o ending and context indicate that it is in the ablative case, which is a messy, multipurpose category for oblique functions often expressed with prepositions in English. It would be accurate to translate \"operando\" as \"in operation\" or \"while running\" or similar, but this form and meaning do not require the use of a preposition in Latin.\n\nIn contrast we have many phrases that use Latin nouns in the ablative to convey a similar concept (the technical means by which something is accomplished), but they often appear with the preposition \"in\". Why? Those phrases usually are expressing a physical (or figuratively physical) location or state in which something is accomplished (*in vitro* fertilization, *in situ* conservation, *in loco parentis*). For those functions and forms, Latin does use a preposition.\n\nI hope that helps!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"operando\" in scientific literature is most accurate?\n\nA) \"In operando\" is the only correct form, as it follows the pattern of other Latin phrases like \"in situ\" and \"in vitro\".\n\nB) Both \"operando\" and \"in operando\" are equally correct and interchangeable in scientific writing.\n\nC) \"Operando\" (without \"in\") is the grammatically correct form, as it is a Latin gerund in the ablative case that doesn't require a preposition.\n\nD) The use of \"operando\" or \"in operando\" is purely a matter of personal preference with no linguistic basis for either form.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. \"Operando\" is a Latin gerund in the ablative case, which doesn't require a preposition to convey the meaning of \"while operating\" or \"during operation\". Unlike phrases like \"in situ\" or \"in vitro\" which use Latin nouns and require the preposition \"in\" to express location or state, \"operando\" as a verbal noun already carries the necessary meaning without a preposition. While both forms are used in scientific literature, the grammatically correct form based on Latin usage is \"operando\" without \"in\". Options A and B are incorrect because they either mandate or equally validate the use of \"in\", which is not necessary.

That's when I first heard \"Thanks for the invite.\"\n\nThis was around the time of the American TV detective drama series \"77 Sunset Strip\", whose cool, rock\\-and\\-rolling Kookie character was a big hit with kids here in the UK. They adopted some of his slang, which may have included the noun *invite*. My parents considered it slangy. It's still considered informal.\n\nI personally wouldn't use it when writing to someone I didn't know, but to a friend I might. You could make \"Thank you for the invitation\" less formal by saying, \"Thanks very much for the invitation.\"\n\nBut \"Thank you\" doesn't sound formal! It can be said with various tones of voice. It can express profound and sincere gratitude but it can also be offhand and perfunctory. When I get off the local bus I quite often say \"Thank you\" to the driver.

By setting $x\\_i\\=(1\\-3\\\\times 0\\.1\\)y\\_i \\+ 0\\.1$ you will achieve a uniform distribution on the simplex $x\\_1\\+x\\_2\\+x\\_3\\=0\\.7$, because it shrinks everything with a constant scale factor and therefore preserves relative areas.\n\nValues from a Dirichlet distribution can be obtained by generating independent Gamma variables and dividing them by their sum. The $(1,1,1\\)$ means each of these Gamma variables must have a Gamma$(1\\)$ distribution (which is an exponential distribution).\n\nHere is sample `R` code:\n\n```\nn <- 1e3\nalpha <- 1\nx <- matrix(rgamma(n*3, alpha), ncol=3)\nx <- x / rowSums(x) * 0.7 + 0.1\n\n```\n\nIncidentally, an alternate way to generate the raw coordinates (on the third line) is with a uniform distribution\n\n```\nx <- matrix(-log(runif(3*n)), ncol=3)\n\n```\n\nbecause the distribution of $\\-\\\\log(U)$, for $U$ Uniform, is Exponential. Thus this method requires no special statistical functions to carry out.\n\nBut how to confirm the result is correct? One way is to rotate the simplex into the plane and plot the points. This `R` code computes such a rotation matrix, confirms it is a rotation matrix by verifying its cross product is the identity, and plots the points.\n\n```\nbeta <- apply(contr.helmert(3), 2, function(y) y / sqrt(crossprod(y)))\ncrossprod(cbind(beta, 1/sqrt(3))) # Outputs the 3 x 3 identity matrix\nz <- x %*% beta\nplot(z)\n\n```\n\nThey look pretty uniform.\n\n[![Figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aps5G.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aps5G.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher wants to simulate a uniform distribution of three random real numbers (x1, x2, x3) that sum to 1, with each number being greater than 0.1.

This directly generates points uniformly distributed on the simplex without need for rejection or reflection. The Dirichlet distribution can be simulated using Gamma variables or transformed uniform variables, making it computationally efficient.

I do understand the proof, and the intuitive explanation about parametrised curves in a plane, but I still think the statement of the theorem looks relatively obscure. Why are we considering a ratio and not something else? This led me to try and generalise, and this is where we get to my question.\n\nI first tried finding a function $h: \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that for any functions $f,g: D \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying Cauchy's mean value theorem's hypotheses, for any interval $\\[a,b] \\\\subset D$, there exists $x \\\\in \\[a,b]$ such that $h(f'(x), g'(x))\\=h(f(b\\-a), g(b\\-a))$. Beyond making a few tries and finding a few counterexamples, I realised this wasn't really in the spirit of a mean value theorem: we are trying to make an analogy, if we may use this term, between $f'(x)$ and $f(b)\\-f(a)$, while in both Lagrange and Cauchy's mean value theorems the analogy is made between $f'(x)$ and $\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a}$. So I started looking for $h$ such that there exists $x$ such that\n$$\nh(f'(x), g'(x))\\= h\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a}, \\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a}\\\\right).\n$$\nBut this didn't really lead me anywhere.\n\n> The question I'm asking is precisely this: can we say anything more about functions $h(x,y) \\\\neq \\\\frac{x}{y}$ satisfying these statements? Suppose we simplify even further, and consider, for example, only the functions $h\\_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}(x,y) \\= x^{\\\\alpha}y^{\\\\beta}$.

The demonstration goes by contradiction: assume that $\\\\Psi$ is a Cauchy function and suppose that there exists at least a number $Y\\_0$ for which $\\\\psi^{\"}(Y\\_0\\)\\\\neq 0$. Moreover, without restriction to generality, let's assume that $\\\\psi^{\"}(Y\\_0\\)\\>0$.

The main theorem** (pp. 496\\-497\\).  \n\nThe characterization of Cauchy functions given by Faedo is expressed by the following\n\n**Theorem**. Let $\\\\Phi(X,Y)\\\\in C^2(\\\\Bbb R^2\\\\setminus E)$ where $E$ is defined as above.

Let $(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\)$ be a point in $\\\\Bbb R^2\\\\setminus E$ for which the partial derivatives\n$$\n\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial X}\\\\bigg\\|\\_{(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\)}\\\\text{ and }\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial Y}\\\\bigg\\|\\_{(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\)}\n$$ are not simultaneously equal to zero. For example and without restriction to generality, let\n$$\n\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right\\|\\_{(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\)}\\\\neq 0\\.\n$$\nSince $\\\\Phi(x\\_0,Y\\_0\\)\\=c$, equation \\\\eqref{3} defines a function $X\\=\\\\psi(Y)$ with $X\\_0\\=\\\\psi(Y\\_0\\)$ and\n$$\n\\\\Phi(\\\\psi(Y),Y)\\-c \\=0\n$$\nat least in a neighborhood of $Y\\_0$, thus can find a $\\\\delta \\>0$ such that if $\\|Y\\-y\\_0\\| \\<\\\\delta$ then also $\\|X\\_0\\-\\\\psi(Y)\\|\\<\\\\delta$. Moreover, since $\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial X}\\\\neq 0$, the function $X\\\\mapsto\\\\Phi(X,Y\\_0\\)$, considered in a neighborhood of $X\\=X\\_0$, takes the value $c$ only in $X\\=X\\_0$. From here on it is possible to proceed as in the proof of the lemma in \u00a75: assume that $\\\\psi^\\\\prime(Y\\_0\\)\\>0$ and put\n$$\n\\\\overline X \\= \\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a},\\\\; \\\\overline Y\\= \\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a}.\n$$\nWe have that\n$$\n\\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a} \\= Y\\_0\n$$\nand moreover\n$$\n\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a} \\= \\\\frac{1}{b\\-a}\\\\int\\\\limits\\_a^b \\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\\\Dm x.\n$$\nwith $\\|X\\_0\\-\\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\|\\<\\\\delta$, and thus\n$$\n\\\\Bigg\\|\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a} \\- X\\_0\\\\Bigg\\|\\=\\\\Bigg\\| \\\\frac{1}{b\\-a}\\\\int\\\\limits\\_a^b \\[\\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\-X\\_0]\\\\Dm x\\\\Bigg\\|\\<\\\\delta.\n$$\nThis implies $\\|\\\\overline{X}\\-X\\_0\\|\\<\\\\delta$ and $\\|\\\\overline{Y}\\-Y\\_0\\|\\<\\\\delta$ and due to the arbitrariness of $\\\\delta$ we have\n$$\n\\\\Phi(\\\\overline{X},\\\\overline{Y}) \\\\neq \\\\Phi(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\) \\= c.\n$$\nEquation \\\\eqref{2} of \u00a75 thus proves that\n$$\n\\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a}, \\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a}\\\\right) \\\\neq \\\\Phi(f^\\\\prime (x), g^\\\\prime(x))\\=c\\\\quad\\\\forall x\\\\in\\[a,b], \n$$\nthus it must be $\\\\psi^{\"}(Y\\_0\\)$ for otherwise $\\\\Phi(X,Y)$ is not a Cauchy function. Thus $\\\\psi(Y)$ must be a linear function, and this implies that\n$$\n\\\\psi^\\\\prime(Y) \\= \\\\text{const.} \\= \\- \\\\frac{{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial Y}}{{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial X}}\n$$\nthus ${{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial X}}\\\\neq 0$ implies ${{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial Y}}\\\\neq 0$, therefore $X\\=\\\\psi(Y)$ is defined for every $X$ except those for which ${\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial X} \\= {\\\\partial \\\\Phi}/{\\\\partial Y} \\= 0$. $\\\\blacksquare$\n\n**\u00a77 and \u00a78\\.

It guarantees that DNS packets can be reassembled if fragmented in transit, as the IPv4 standard requires all hosts to handle packets of 576 bytes or less (which accommodates the 512-byte payload plus headers).\n\n2. Smaller packets have a lower chance of being randomly dropped in transit.\n\n3. It optimizes performance while generating minimal network traffic.\n\n4.

The LGPL (Lesser General Public License) requires the distribution of source code modifications when the software is distributed. However, merely using the software to run a website, without distributing the software itself, does not trigger this requirement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because deploying a website based on LGPL software does not automatically require publishing modifications.\n\nOption B is correct. Using LGPL software to host a website, without distributing the software itself, does not constitute \"distribution\" under the license terms.

The standard downvote guidance is `This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful`.  \n\nInterpreting this broadly, off\\-topic questions are \"not useful\" (they detract from the purpose of the site and lower its overall quality), and many people downvote off\\-topic questions.  \n\nOverly broad questions, or poorly asked ones, often find themselves in the same boat.\n\nIn addition questions are automatically downvoted *by the system* when they are closed for certain reasons (this is to encourage the automatic question deletion algorithm to remove them after a sufficient period of time has elapsed).  \n\nIf you have a bunch of closed questions sitting at `-1` (which you do) it's because a cold, heartless algorithm automatically slapped that downvote on there when the question was closed so that other cold, heartless algorithms would know it's OK to reap the question.\n\n---\n\nFinally, and please don't take this the wrong way, I took a look at your question history (since there aren't a lot of them) and they frankly don't pass muster when measured against our quality standards (which I will freely admit are higher and enforced a little more rigidly than many other SE sites). \n\nRemember that Server Fault is a site [for Information Technology Professionals needing expert answers related to managing computer systems in a **professional capacity**](https://serverfault.com/faq) (right out of the FAQ).  \n\nSome of your questions are clearly about a home environment (which is specifically off\\-topic per the FAQ), and others are product/service recommendations (also specifically called out as off\\-topic in the FAQ, as well as [this network blog post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/)).\n\nYou should not be surprised if those sorts of questions get stomped on, nor should you be surprised that we don't dump the product\\-and\\-service\\-recommendation types on our sister sites (particularly SuperUser, which was so plagued by them that it precipitated the declaration that they are not allowed on the network)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user on StackExchange has had several questions closed as off-topic on ServerFault.com, resulting in a question ban.

There are $\\\\binom{n}{q}$ possible subsets of the $n$ places that will correspond to the locations of the $q$ queens.\n2. Count the number of ways to create a pattern $p$ by starting with the largest possible counts of queens and working down:\n\n\t* There are $\\\\binom{m}{p\\_k}$ ways of choosing the $p\\_k$ hands that will contain $k$ queens. All are equally probable.\n\t* After those hands are selected, there remain $m\\-p\\_k$ hands and therefore, *conditional* on selecting the hands with $k$ queens, there are $\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}$ ways of selecting the hands with $k\\-1$ queens.

Thus, $$\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\binom{k}{k\\-1}^{p\\_{k\\-1}}$$ counts the possible arrangements.\n\t* Proceed in the same manner for indexes $i$ from $k$ down through $1$. **The total number of possible ways to distribute the queens to create pattern $p$ is the product of the individual counts, equal to** $$\\\\binom{m}{p\\_k}\\\\cdot\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\binom{k}{k\\-1}^{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\cdots \\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k\\-\\\\cdots\\-p\\_2}{p\\_1}\\\\binom{k}{1}^{p\\_{1}}.$$\n\nDividing (2\\) by (1\\) gives the desired probabilities.\n\nIn the example of the question,\n\n* Two hands with two queens, $p\\=(0,2\\)$, occur with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{2}}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{1}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.01538462\\.$$\n* $p\\=(2,1\\)$ occurs with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{1}\\\\binom{7}{2}\\\\binom{2}{1}^2}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{24}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.36923077\\.$$\n* $p\\=(4,0\\)$ occurs with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{4}\\\\binom{2}{1}^4}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{40}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.61538462\\.$$\n\n---\n\n**Let's check with a simulation.** Here are the results of 10,000 computer\\-generated deals as output by the following `R` program:\n\n```\n               0,2    2,1    4,0\nsimulation 0.01600 0.3731 0.6109\ntheory     0.01538 0.3692 0.6154\n\n```\n\nThe agreement is excellent.\n\n```\n#\n# Specify the problem.\n#\nm <- 8\nk <- 2\nq <- 4\n#\n# Create a data structure.\n#\nn <- m*k\nDeck <- c(rep(1,q), rep(0, n-q))\n#\n# Perform a simulation.\n#\nset.seed(17)\np <- replicate(1e4, {\n  paste(tabulate(colSums(matrix(sample(Deck, n), k)), k), collapse=\",\")\n})\n#\n# Theory.\n#\nf <- function(p, m, k){\n  p <- rev(p[1:k])\n  n <- m*k\n  q <- sum(k:1 * p)\n  a <- m - c(0, cumsum(p[-k]))\n  exp(sum(lchoose(a, p) + lchoose(k, 0:(k-1))*p) - lchoose(n,q))\n}\n#\n# Summarize the simulation.\n#\nsimulation <- table(p) / length(p)\ntheory <- sapply(names(simulation), function(s) {\n  eval(parse(text=paste0(\"f(c(\", s, \"), \", m, \", \", k, \")\")))\n})\n#\n# Compare to theory.\n#\nsignif(rbind(simulation, theory), 4)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a card game, 16 cards are used: 4 Aces, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, and 4 Jacks.

When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see\n>  positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and\n>  are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them.\n>  TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to\n>  communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism\n>  However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out\n>  individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be\n>  continually tested and refactored.\n\n**Practical TDD**\n\nFormal automated Testing, especially Unit Testing every method of every class is just as bad an anti\\-pattern and not testing anything. There is a balance to be had. Are you writing unit tests for every `setXXX/getXXX` method, they are methods as well!\n\nAlso Tests can help save time and money, but don't forget that they cost time and money to develop and they are code, so they cost time and money to maintain. If they atrophy from lack of maintenance then they become a liability more than a benefit.\n\nLike everything like this, there is a **balance** which can't be defined by anyone but yourself. Any dogma either way is probably more wrong that correct.\n\nA good metric is code that is critical to the business logic and subject to frequent modification based on changing requirements. Those things needs formal tests that are automated, that would be a big return on investment.\n\nYou are going to be very hard pressed to find many professional shops that work this way either. It just doesn't make business sense to spend money testing things that will for all practical purposes never change after a simple smoke test is preformed. Writing formal automated unit tests for `.getXXX/.setXXX` methods is a prime example of this, complete waste of time.\n\n> It is now two decades since it was pointed out that program testing\n>  may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs, but can never\n>  demonstrate their absence.

Writing tests for every single method, especially simple ones like getters and setters, can be counterproductive.

Is there any way to sample both signals at the same time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tell us more about your signals. If they're slow enough, you may be able to get away with using on the onboard ADC. You didn't say which AVR model you're using, but most AVRs I've used had a maximum sampling frequency of around 4kHz. If you need to sample two signals with it, the ADC is multiplexed, so cut that in half. Unless your signals are significantly slower than that (and without trying it, I would guess a factor of 10 would be pushing it), I would go with a two\\-channel external ADC. The goal is to sample fast enough that relative to the slower signal, the samples were taken at approximately the same time. The multiplexer in the onboard and some external ADCs will take some finite time to switch. This needs to be considered. The uC clock also needs to be running fast enough that it can complete the necessary math before the next samples."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When implementing a noise cancellation project using the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm on a microcontroller, which of the following statements is true regarding signal sampling?\n\nA) The onboard ADC of most AVR microcontrollers can easily handle simultaneous sampling of two signals at any frequency\nB) For two signals, the effective sampling frequency of the onboard ADC is approximately half of its maximum sampling frequency\nC) An external two-channel ADC is always necessary, regardless of the signal frequency\nD) The microcontroller clock speed has no impact on the sampling process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states that most AVR microcontrollers have an onboard ADC with a maximum sampling frequency of around 4kHz. However, when sampling two signals, this frequency is effectively halved due to the multiplexed nature of the ADC. This means that for two signals, the effective sampling frequency would be around 2kHz.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the onboard ADC cannot handle simultaneous sampling of two signals at any frequency. There are limitations based on the ADC's maximum sampling rate and the multiplexing process.\n\nOption C is not always true. An external two-channel ADC is recommended for higher frequency signals, but for slower signals, the onboard ADC might be sufficient.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the microcontroller clock speed is crucial.

I have looked up the topic in the web, but only found that the bodies apply forces on each other for some short interval of time and not how they move *during* that interval. After the collision, the two bodies may go in the opposite directions, or in the same direction, but in which direction are they moving during this collision, that is during this brief period of contact (whatever it is microscopically)? I don't know how to go about thinking this problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's read what says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision):\n\n> A perfectly elastic collision is defined as one in which there is no loss of kinetic energy in the collision. In reality, any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some kinetic energy to internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large\\-scale impacts are perfectly elastic. However, some problems are sufficiently close to perfectly elastic that they can be approximated as such. In this case, the coefficient of restitution equals one.\n\nSo what happens in the real case? Hard bodies are one which are not easy deformable. They get deformed in such a way that to some extend of energy the applied energy is kicked back in a short time.\n\nThere is nearly no dissipation of the energy out from the direction of the collision. In the direction of the collision the molecules get shifted but this shift has a minimal \\- in reference to an elastic body \\- extend and once has gone through the body returns very fast back and kick the other body.\n\n> In which direction are the two bodies moving during a collision?\n\nAt the first half of the collision the involved area is simply moving slower (gets deformed) as the whole moving body and at the second half this deformation vanishes completely again. If one of the bodies is in rest the description is a little bit different: In the first half of the collision the involved area starts moving and in the second half the body gains velocity faster the deformed area and the deformation vanishes.\n\nTo be more precise, the first and the second \"half\" are a little of different time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: During a collision between two hard bodies, what happens to their motion and deformation in the brief period of contact?\n\nA) The bodies immediately reverse direction and maintain constant velocity throughout the collision.\n\nB) The bodies come to a complete stop at the point of contact and then accelerate away from each other.\n\nC) The area of contact decelerates and deforms in the first half of the collision, then accelerates and returns to its original shape in the second half.\n\nD) The bodies maintain their original velocities but change shape permanently at the point of contact.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. During a collision between hard bodies, the process occurs in two main phases:\n\n1. In the first half of the collision, the area of contact decelerates relative to the rest of the body and deforms. This deformation absorbs some of the kinetic energy of the collision.\n\n2. In the second half, this deformed area accelerates back to the speed of the rest of the body and returns to its original shape. This releases the stored energy, propelling the bodies apart.\n\nThis process explains why the bodies don't immediately reverse direction (ruling out A), don't come to a complete stop (ruling out B), and don't maintain their original velocities or change shape permanently (ruling out D). The collision is a dynamic process of deformation and reformation that occurs over a brief period, resulting in the exchange of momentum between the colliding bodies."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/26", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/623965", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 623965, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> High tides and low tides are caused by the Moon.

For large bodies of water like oceans, this difference is significant enough to cause observable tidal bulges. However, for a small container like a bottle, the difference in gravitational pull from one side to the other is negligible, resulting in no measurable tidal effect.

This way, I can have releases of this libraries, and it let me choose between updating or **not updating** the projects that depend on it. You generally don't want to force an update on a project if you can avoid it, and breaking a build is certainly the worst way to force an update. Stability comes to the price of relatively quick edition. But at the end of the day the time you loose managing your library is far less than the time and energy you would loose handling unhappy programmers with their builds broken.\n\nThis method implies that the common code is relatively stable, and that's where unit testing and even TDD really pays. It's possible to debate about their Return On Investment in small projects, but in my opinion, they really worth it when you're dealing with code that is used across multiple projects, because you cannot just go around and compile/test every project that use it.\n\nRegarding SVN, If you go the binary way, each library should become a distinct project, and each release implies a label, and optionally a branch if maintenance is preferable to update. Avoid the monster library that rule them all. You would have to update it every time there's a minor change, making it impossible for projects to follow the versions. That's where it takes a bit of architecture, to organize your libraries, if they have dependencies on each others.\n\nAs for the binaries, some people upload them in SVN, some people use scripts to download them from a network repository. It really depends on the binaries size, the update frequences, your network architecture, and your personnal preferences.\n\nThat's my experience with this specific issue, but I mainly worked in C/C\\+\\+ and .Net, so there might be other ways to combine editability and stability that I'm not aware of :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is working on multiple projects that share internal libraries.

Is there any resource for beginners to understand algorithms with graph?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you've read the [Wikipedia kNN Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)? (It has a diagram illustrating how it works in 2 dimensions.)\n\nAs a simple example, assume you're looking to classify homes by \"Well\\-maintained\" or \"Not well\\-maintained\". You have a map and you are able to stick pins on this map: green for \"Well\\-maintained\" and red for \"Not well\\-maintained\". You go online and find some recent photos of a couple dozen houses in your section of the town and as you look at each one, you place either a red or green pin in your map at the location of the house.\n\nThen your realtor friend calls you and says, \"Hey, I have a call about a house at such\\-and\\-such address and I hear you are researching how well\\-maintained houses are. Is this one likely to be well\\-maintained?\" So you find that address on your map and look at the 10 nearest pins and 8 out of 10 are green. So you tell your friend, \"It looks like there's a fairly high chance that it's well\\-maintained.\"\n\nIn this example, $k\\=10$, and the distance was the literal distance (based on lat/lon) of houses. We're making the assumption that blocks, streets, neighborhoods tend to be well\\-maintained or not, which is somewhat plausible but of course there are always exceptions.\n\nSo, to generalize a bit, you first gather a set of points that you know the classification of already. These will be your exemplars. When you have a new point that comes in and you want to classify it, you look at the $k$ exemplars that are closest to the new point and the most common classification is what you decide your new point must be. Obviously, if all $k$ nearest exemplars are from one class, you're pretty certain of your new classification. And if the $k$ nearest exemplars fall into $k$ different classes you really can't make a decision at all. Between those two extremes, you have varying levels of confidence.\n\nWith $k\\=1$, the new point is considered to be of the same class as its nearest exemplar, no voting necessary. But you're more likely to make mistakes because of the exceptions I mentioned. Larger $k$ allows more votes and in general that leads to more stable outcomes, but you also end up with more distant exemplars voting and you homogenize out local variations.\n\nIn real problems, you will not have lat/lon of houses, but a lot of facts/measurements for each data point. For a person, maybe height, weight, age, smoker/non\\-smoker, etc. The distance between people is more abstract, but you can come up with such a distance and do the same thing \\-\\- in as many dimensions as facts/measurements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given kNN algorithm explanation:\n\nQuestion: A real estate company wants to use the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to predict whether houses in a new neighborhood are likely to be well-maintained or not.

The first way involves the electron cloud oscillating with the photon but emit it again without permanently absorbing it. The other way involves the electron cloud oscillating at around its resonant frequency, which causes the absorption of photons to excite the electron cloud to higher energy states. But from my understanding of quantum mechanics, energy levels should be discrete, why would a range of photons be able to cause the elctron clouds to resonate and then excite them to different degrees? Also, is emission lines only produced by ions and would be irrelevant here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let us first try to understand why we must get peaks in our spectra. Considered for simplicity, transitions between $3$ energy levels. Now if the energy levels are sharply defined, then we expect to see three peaks in our spectra, not because there are $3$ levels but because there are $3$ unique pairs that can be formed ($^3C\\_2\\=3$).[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQSnn.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQSnn.jpg)The height of the spectra depends on how strongly the energy levels in question couple with the electromagnetic field. \n\nIn gases, the energy levels are usually sharply defined. But still the spectra is not completely discrete. One of the main reasons is Doppler effect. Due to the motion of the atoms, they see a Doppler shifted frequency of the incoming light. This means they absorb light of \u201cwrong\u201d frequency. And since the atoms in general have a velocity distribution, this translates to a distribution in the resonant frequency. This causes a broadening in the spectra(which can be reduced by lowering the temperature). \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EKf7.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EKf7.jpg)\n\nComing to solids, the energy levels are not sharp to begin with. They are broad in general.

In solids, energy levels are not sharply defined as they are in gases. Instead, they form broad bands, allowing for a continuous range of electronic transitions. This broadening of energy levels results in absorption bands rather than discrete spectral lines.\n\nOption A is incorrect because solids do not have a uniform distribution of energy levels across all wavelengths. There are still preferred energy ranges for transitions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the Doppler effect does contribute to spectral line broadening, it is more significant in gases than in solids. The primary reason for broad absorption bands in solids is the inherent broadening of energy levels.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it contradicts the nature of energy levels in solids.

It is a way to express the effect size in a dimensionless way.\n\nThe standardized mean difference, is a property of the populations. It has not to do with the sample size and is *not* influenced by the sample size.\n\n**Cohen's $\\\\bf d$** is a statistic that estimates the standardized mean difference.\n\nFor Cohen's $d$, which is a statistic computed with a sample, there will be an influence of the sample size on the distribution of the statistic. This difference is that for increasing sample size the Cohen's $d$ will be more close to the standardized mean difference (but the expectation value of Cohen's $d$ will not be affected by the sample size).\n\n**The t\\-statistic** is the observed effect size divided by the standard error of the observed effect size. This error becomes smaller for larger samples, and the t\\-statistic will be larger for smaller samples (provided the effect size is non\\-zero).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nWhen we estimate the difference in the means of two populations, $\\\\mu\\_2\\- \\\\mu \\_1$, then we have the following expressions for the standard mean difference, Cohen's $d$, and the t\\-statistic.\n\n**Standardized mean difference** is a property of the populations and independent from $n$ and just the difference in the (true) population means divided by the (true) standard deviation of the populations (more complex formula's exist when the population's standard deviations are unequal)\n\n$$SMD \\= \\\\frac{\\\\mu\\_2\\- \\\\mu\\_1}{\\\\sigma}$$\n\nBelow is an example for two Gaussian distributed populations.

As sample size increases, Cohen's d will become a more precise estimate of the true standardized mean difference, but its expected value does not change with sample size. In contrast, the t-statistic is influenced by sample size. For a given effect size, the t-statistic can become very large as sample size increases because the standard error of the difference between means (which is in the denominator of the t-statistic) becomes smaller with larger samples. This means that even for small effect sizes, the t-statistic can become quite large if the sample size is sufficiently large. Option C correctly captures this relationship between Cohen's d and the t-statistic as sample size increases."}}
