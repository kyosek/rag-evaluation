The dynamics for $r$ can be analyzed separately from dynamics of $\\\\phi$: it is a linear monotonous mapping which has exactly one fixed point at $r\\=1$ and no other periodic or fixed points. So, if any periodic points of full mapping do exist, they must be contained in $r\\=1$. Let's see what happens when $r \\=1$: $(1, \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}) \\\\mapsto (1, \\\\tilde{\\\\phi} \\+ \\\\theta \\\\mod 2\\\\pi)$, so the set $r \\=1$ is an invariant set. Because of \nmonotonicity, it is possible to show that the image of any set $\\\\alpha \\< r \\< \n\\\\beta$ with $\\\\alpha \\< 1 \\< \\\\beta$ lies in the interior of itself.

On Windows, the app itself freezes but not the whole GUI. Is there a way to make Ubuntu behave more like Windows in that respect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Modern OSs use paging to manage memory. It gives some advantadges to the system like being able to use more memory than you have physically, securing some sensitive memory area (like the kernel reserved memory) amongst other things that I can point some reference to if you want to learn more about paging.\n\nBut what is paging?\n===================\n\nI'll skip the technicals and give you an analogy. Imagine you have an encyclopedia collection, A to Z, and being a curious person you like to spend afternoons reading it. You keep all of the encyclopedias on your bookshelf and you have a reading table which you can have 4 books on.\n\nOne day you are reading about \"Sailing\", which is on the letter S encyclopedia. At some point you might need to read about something else related, like \"Winds\" on letter W book. As long as you have it on your reading table you can quickly open it and read what you need, then go back to the \"Sailing\" book. Problem is, since your reading table can only fit 4 books, the chances are high you will need a book that isn't there already. Then you would need to take one of the books from the table back to the shelf, grab the book you need to the reading table and read it.\n\n**Ok, what does this whole book story has to do with my freezes?** Well, the computer does something similar all the time. To be able to use more memory than it physically has, the computer divide memory in *pages*, which are small continuous blocks of memory. Those don't need to be on RAM (the \"reading table\") all the time, they might be stored on your disk (the \"bookshelf\"). If the RAM is full and the CPU needs to read/write on those pages stored on disk, one of the pages on RAM will be stored on disk, and the page requested will be loaded on RAM. \n\nThis is a Kernel job, so it is transparent to the user and programs. But since reading and writing to the disk is **much** slower than reading and writing on RAM, you will notice those freezes.\n\nOn Linux, there is a partition called *swap*, which is used to store those extra pages. Windows does the same thing, but I think it uses a file. The system kernel itself won't freeze, since it will be on locked (\"non\\-swappable\") pages.\n\nThe image below (from an wikipedia article) illustrates the concept of paging (and virtual memory, which we don't need to go into). Those blocks represents the pages being allocated on both memory or disk.\n[![Virtual Memory Paging](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vd5l.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vd5l.png)\n\nI believe the reason it might look like Linux is freezing too, is because Unity (the desktop GUI) might experience the delays caused by this swapping, while on Windows they might keep the desktop GUI code in locked (\"non\\-swappable\") pages. This is just a brainstorm theory though."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of memory management in operating systems, what is the primary purpose of paging and how does it relate to the freezing issues described in Ubuntu?\n\nA) Paging is used to encrypt sensitive data and has no relation to system freezes.\nB) Paging allows the OS to use more memory than physically available, but can cause system delays when swapping occurs.\nC) Paging is a method to compress data in RAM, causing temporary freezes during decompression.\nD) Paging is exclusive to Linux systems and is the root cause of GUI freezes not seen in Windows.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Paging is a memory management technique used by modern operating systems, including both Linux and Windows. It allows the system to use more memory than is physically available by dividing memory into pages that can be stored either in RAM or on disk (in a swap partition or file). When the system needs to access a page that's not in RAM, it must swap it from disk, which is much slower and can cause noticeable delays or freezes. This explains the freezing issues described in Ubuntu, especially when memory-intensive applications like Android Studio's emulator are launched. The freezes are not exclusive to Linux, but may appear more pronounced due to differences in how the desktop GUI is managed compared to Windows."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/27", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/32334", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 32334, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to say this?\n\n> 1.

A quick scroll down and I hit four code blocks, two of which have scroll bars on them. This is something that then starts to *look* like one that is going to delve too far into code or fix my code/design type questions.\n\nMany of the questions that tend to be \"here is a lot of code\" tend to get answers that are \"here is a lot of code too.\" Those answers aren't ideal for P.SE, and so questions that ask them may get down voted.\n3. Where is the question? After digging down a bit, they are between two code blocks. The questions appear to be:\n\n\t1. Is there another name for this pattern?\n\t2. Is this really an Adapter?\n\t3. So, does the compiler have no mechanism to check such semantic inconsistencies?\n\t4. Something that looks like a design review.Asking multiple questions in a single post is problematic. Someone could answer the \"another name\" question, and another answer the adapter one, and a third about the compiler. None (or all) of them are 'right' for the question.\n\nWhile I may just be missing it... but I seem to have some difficulty matching the \"abstract stuff in C\\#\" in the question title to the questions being asked.\n4.

My intuition is it does not matter what method we choose, as it is an irreducible error, but most solutions I found said that the high variance of error terms means that the sample will have a lot of noise in the relationship.

As you mentioned, this is irreducible error, but an overfitted model will make much larger errors on the holdout set. Its aim is never reducing the irreducible error."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In statistical learning, when the variance of error terms (\u03c3\u00b2) is extremely high, which approach is generally recommended and why?\n\nA) A more flexible method, because it can better capture the underlying pattern despite the noise.\nB) A less flexible method, because it is less likely to overfit to the noise in the data.\nC) The choice of method doesn't matter, as high error variance represents irreducible error.\nD) A combination of flexible and inflexible methods to balance noise reduction and pattern detection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: When the variance of error terms (\u03c3\u00b2) is extremely high, it indicates that there is a lot of noise in the relationship between predictors and the response variable. In this situation, a less flexible (more rigid) method is generally recommended. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is:\n\n1. A less flexible method is less likely to overfit to the noise in the data. It will capture broader trends rather than fitting to specific data points that may be heavily influenced by noise.\n\n2. While it's true that high error variance contributes to irreducible error, the goal is not to reduce this error (which is impossible by definition), but to avoid making it worse through overfitting.\n\n3. More flexible methods have a higher risk of interpreting noise as meaningful patterns, leading to poor generalization on new, unseen data.\n\n4. A less flexible method will provide a more stable and generalizable model, even if it doesn't capture all the nuances in the training data.\n\n5. The trade-off here is between bias and variance. In high-noise situations, it's often better to accept a bit more bias (from a less flexible model) to reduce the risk of high variance (overfitting to noise).\n\nThis question tests understanding of the bias-variance trade-off, the concept of irreducible error, and the impact of noise on model selection in statistical learning."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/04", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/17349", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/5277/"], "docs_id": 17349, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'd like to write the following:\n\n```\nSome long paragraph of text \\measureremainder{\\whatsleft}\\begin{mimipage}{\\whatsleft}\n    stuff\n\\end{minipage}\n\n```\n\nso that the minipage takes up exactly the remaining `\\hsize` minus `\\widthof{Some long paragraph of text}`.

While there *is* a castle on Koholint Island, it belongs to a nobleman, and not to a king.\n\n### [The Sacred Realm / Dark World](http://zeldawiki.org/Dark_World)\n\nFirst introduced in *A Link to the Past*, the Dark World exists in a dimension parallel to Hyrule and is a corrupted version of the Sacred Realm (where the Triforce rests).

It is considered a parallel world to Hyrule due to its stark resemblance to the Kingdom. Termina is split in 5 areas: the swamps, home to the Deku Scrubs and their king; the mountains, home to the Gorons and their elder; the ocean, where the Zoras live; the Ikana Canyon, where the Ikana kingdom once stood; and Clock Town, which is ruled by a mayor.\n\n### [Labrynna](http://zeldawiki.org/Labrynna)\n\nThe setting for *Oracle of Ages*, it is one of few places that ***aren't*** a parallel version of Hyrule one way or another.

So dealing with Mock Objects is just developer job ?. The reason i ask is i'm interested in QA as my career and am learning tools like JUnit , TestNG and couple of frameworks. I just want to know until what level of unit testing is done by developer and from what point QA engineer takes over testing for better test coverage ?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edit** : Based on the answers below am providing more details about what QA i was referring to . I'm interested in more of Test Automation rather than simple QA involved in record and play of script. So Test Automation engineers are responsible for developing frameworks ? or do they have a team of developers dedicated in Framework development ?\nYes i was asking about usage of Mock Objects for testing from Test Automation engineer perspective. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Hey.  \n\nFirst question: **do you want to** use xUnit frameworks, mock frameworks, and **write code?** \n\nIf not, don't bother. 90% of jobs for testers doesn't include writing code, so if it is not something you are looking for, you can skip this set of knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand if you like writing code, somehow you don't think about being developer, there is possibility to work on test automation which will require coding skills. Particular programming language will depend on the toll/application stack but you will be required to write code. \n\nAs for xUnit frameworks, probably you won't write unit test (as mentioned dev job), but it is possible you will be using them as *runner* for your tests. For example Selenium that was mentioned here doesn't require coding skills if you use SeleniumIDE which is only one of products. If you use SeleniumCore \\- than you are using api that wraps around browser. In this case you write code that will perform tests on given application. And if you put this code into xUnit framework you will have runner, reports with it. \n\nAs for mock objects you will be using them in very rare situations. Maybe when you will be building automation framework for your app. But depending on the approach you can skip it. \n\n**EDIT**\nAs per new answers and edit of the main question.\nI agree with c\\_maker \\- you probably won't be writing unit tests for application code, but it is possible to write unit tests for your automation framework software is software iven if it is software testing other software. Here again as c\\_maker said, if you wrote gui level tests with selenium using Selenium \\- those are acceptance tests not unit tests.  \n\nAnyway check following links so you will now how work of test automation engineer *may* look:  \n\n \\- [Quick overview](http://www.teknologika.com/blog/building-the-next-generation-of-automated-tests/)  \n\n \\- [Bigger explanation](http://www.teknologika.com/blog/implementing-the-braidy-testers-automation-stack/)  \n\n \\- [Inspiration for all above and few pdf describing it](http://www.thebraidytester.com/stack.html)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A QA engineer interested in test automation is learning about JUnit, TestNG, and other testing frameworks.

Key points supporting this answer:\n\n1. Test Automation engineers may use xUnit frameworks (like JUnit or TestNG) as runners for their automated tests, not necessarily for writing application unit tests.\n2. While they typically don't write unit tests for application code (that's usually a developer's job), they might write unit tests for their own automation framework code.\n3. Working with mock objects is rare for Test Automation engineers, but it can happen when building automation frameworks.\n4. The focus is more on creating automated tests (often at the GUI or acceptance level) using tools like Selenium, rather than unit testing application code.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they overstate the Test Automation engineer's involvement in unit testing and mock object creation for application code.

Had an idea to divide it to different arrays, but don't know if it worth it. I would appreciate any help in solving this question.\n3. And last one \\- how do I implement date to my array? I mean, is there a way to add it, that it would look like `20.02.2013`, not smth like `Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2010`. I could make it a simple string, but I need to have the ability to compare dates later (user inserts date, but program shows all rows after it). Right now I have made date like an ordinary double type number and have comparing code like:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(\"Insert date\");\n    double date1 = scan.nextDouble();\n     for (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){\n         if (arr[i][4]!=null) {\n         if((double)arr[i][4]>date1)\n             System.out.println(arr[i][0]);\n     }\n}\n\n```\n\nWorks fine, but would smth like that work for actual dates?  \n\nThanks in advance, I will appreciate any help in solving any of those problems.

Within MageBridge, the Add To Cart Menu\\-Item therefore performs a little trick, that first visits a temporary page simply to initialize the Magento session and then redirects to the Magento add\\-to\\-cart URL and then redirects to the cart (or whatever redirect you have configured here). This only is an issue in the browser if the browser has no Magento cookie set \\- so most likely this issue can be replayed by flushing all Joomla / MageBridge / Magento cookies from the browser. However, I don't know if this is really the cause of issues, because it works in fine in all 6 testing sites I've just tested this in.\n\n2\\) In Magento 1\\.9, the secret form key (which has already been in some forms for some time) was implemented in numerous other forms. Without the proper form key sent in the POST request, the POST request simply fails and redirects to some other default URL. This also happened for the add\\-to\\-cart URL, which means that all Magento URLs with \"checkout/cart/add\" also need to have an additional parameter \"form\\_key/XXX\" in it. With a Magento page, this link is automatically generated. But if you have a link in a newsletter (or a Joomla page that is not loading Magento yet), this fails. For this specific condition, there is the MageBridge option to disable the Magento form key entirely, but this will also drop security on other forms. Instead, I will build a new feature that automatically fixes this for the add\\-to\\-cart URL specifically. This will be implemented in the next MageBridge build (today).\n\n**I hope this will help you.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Magento e-commerce site is experiencing issues with the \"Add to Cart\" functionality when accessed from external sources like newsletters or non-Magento pages.

This approach allows for downloading large datasets that can be processed and merged to create the desired .csv file with one row per census block group and columns for variables like median income and median age.\n\nOption A (using American FactFinder) is mentioned in the question as being \"almost useless\" for this kind of bulk data collection.

When a log transformation results in a normal distribution, it indicates that the original data follows a log-normal distribution. This is a distinct distribution from the normal distribution and is characterized by right-skewness in its untransformed state. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the original data was not normally distributed; the transformation revealed its log-normal nature, not a hidden normal distribution.\n\nAnswer B is a common misconception. The log-normal distribution of the transformed data actually proves that the original data was not normally distributed, but rather log-normally distributed.\n\nAnswer D is a broad generalization that is incorrect.

We also provide an API where external parties can provide roof input and preferences, and return an installation summary, instruction guide, bill of materials, etc.\n\nThe biggest hurdle external parties need to go through is the huge amount of \"dynamic\" constraints that we have.\nJust a few examples:\n\n* If your roof has tiles, you need to specify a roof hook type\n* If you have a product preference for product A, you cannot have a vertical rail orientation\n* If your roof is higher than X meters, you also need to specify which product Y you would like to ensure it is really safe.\n\nNow, imagine a constraintset with \\~250 of these dynamic constraints. Where one input leads to another required input, or invalidates some other input, or limits a third input, etc.\n\nWe have been putting a lot of these constraints in text (and exposing the whole as a swagger documentation), but this is becoming quite an issue in integrating our api for our partners.\n\nThe problem they have is not that they can't figure out what is wrong with the request they have sent to us, because we provide them with a meaningful error. No, rather, the problem is that they have no choice but to present this error to *their* customer, because they don't know beforehand which options they should gray out or not.\n\n**Question**\n\nI'm looking for some technique to share these kind of validation constraints to our customers, such that they can implement proper input validation before sending a request.\n\nStep 2 is of course automating this so we can update it to always reflect the latest codebase (since we're still working on it).\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHow can I properly document (a fairly large amount of) highly dynamic constraints on our api so customers integrating our api can implement proper input validation for their endusers?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This seems to be the perfect use case for implementing a simple [rules engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rules_engine).\n\nIn your case, the rules are just \"validation rules\". Each rule needs to contain the code for the validation (which may throw an exception when the constraint is violated), as well as the documentation of the specific rule. That would allow you\n\n* to execute the rules during validation in your application\n* ro create a custom documentation generator tool which extracts the docs from the rule objects and includes them into a summary\n\nIn case you are implementing and maintaining the rules in code (and not in some DSL), this can be pretty simple and straightforward to implement. Something along the lines of (using C\\# like pseudo code):\n\n```\n  class ValidationRule\n  {\n        public abstract void Execute();   // throws an exception when rule is violated\n        public abstract string Description();  \n  }\n\n  class RoofTileCheck\n  {\n       // roof can be null in case only the description is required\n       public RoofTileCheck(Roof roof)\n       {\n           this.roof=roof;\n       }\n       public override void Execute()\n       {\n           if(roof.HasTiles && roof.Hooktype==Hooktype.None)\n                throw new ValidationException($\"Roof {roof.ID} has tiles but no hook type\");\n       }\n       public override string Description()\n       {\n            return \"If your roof has tiles, you need to specify a roof hook type\";\n       }\n  }\n\n```\n\nIf all of your 250 rules need different code, this would end up in 250 different classes, but I guess in reality there will probably fewer of them, since some of them can probably be implemented using the same class, just with different constructor parameters.\n\nFinally, you need a factory for instantiating the rule objects for your main application's rule execution loop, and another one for your documentation generator. Maybe it is the same factory if you have a 1:1 correspondence between the specific rules in your application and the docs, and a different one if some rules will only be required as some representatives in the docs.\n\nOf course, this is just a rough guideline and you may need to flesh out a lot of details here, but I gues you got the idea."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company providing solar panel installation instructions is looking to improve their API documentation for dynamic constraints. Which of the following approaches would best address their need to share validation constraints with customers and allow for automated updates?\n\nA) Implement a large SQL database to store all possible constraint combinations and provide customers with database access\n\nB) Create a rules engine where each validation rule contains both executable code and documentation, allowing for both application validation and documentation generation\n\nC) Develop a complex XML schema that describes all possible constraints and require customers to parse and interpret it\n\nD) Provide a separate REST API endpoint for each individual constraint that customers must query before submitting installation requests\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the best solution as it addresses the key requirements mentioned in the documentation. A rules engine allows for:\n1. Encoding both the validation logic and its description in one place\n2. Easy execution of rules during API validation\n3. Generation of documentation from the same source as the actual validation rules\n4. Flexibility to update rules and have both the application and documentation stay in sync\n5.

When the goal is absolutely no downtime then performance will almost always have to take a second position to reliability.\n\nYou say that your timespan for a typical response is a matter of milliseconds but how do you want to handle the situation where an error occurs within this timeframe? It is easy to imagine a machine getting reset while it is waiting on a long process (say on the order of hours) but that reset could also happen directly in the middle of a transaction that would typically happen in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe the machine loses power at that exact moment or the RAM ends up corrupted. \n\nIf reliability is the key to your system then I would say that your only real option is to write the data to a safe storage location before you process it. If the data is not safely stored then it is not processed by the system.\n\nThe better solution would most likely be to lower your requirement form 100% to 99\\.9% or similar and then you could ignore situations like the aforementioned error within a typically fast process."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web application needs to handle a stream of data with strict latency requirements and 100% reliability. 99% of read/write operations occur within milliseconds, while 1% can take hours or days.

By writing data to both RAM and disk simultaneously, it ensures data persistence for the 100% reliability requirement while still allowing fast access for the 99% of quick read/write operations. Checking RAM first for reads optimizes performance in most cases, with disk as a fallback for the 1% of longer-term storage needs. This approach addresses both the latency concerns and the need for complete data reliability, even in case of system failures or power loss.\n\nOption A doesn't guarantee 100% reliability as data could be lost before being written to disk.

But when we are reading about one dimensional wave, it moves up and down if it's going along x axis. How its possible?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDbyn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If this is a wave on a piece of string then yes it does require (at least) two dimensions. That's because the amplitude of the wave is its displacement in the direction normal to the string. But there are lots of waves where the amplitude is not a physical displacement in a dimension, so these waves do not need a second direction.\n\nFor example consider a light wave. The amplitude of a light wave at a point is the value of the electromagnetic field at that point. For example for a one dimensional light wave travelling along the x axis the electric field of the light would be given by:\n\n$$ E(t,x) \\= E\\_0 \\\\sin(\\\\omega t \\- kx) $$\n\nThis wave doesn't need a second dimension because unlike the wave on a string it isn't oscillating in a physical dimension.\n\nFor completeness we should mention that even for mechanical waves, like a wave on a string, the motion in the second dimension is small compared to the distance travelled. In that case the wave is approximately one dimensional. Also note that as my2cts mentions there are waves like sound waves that are longitudinal i.e. the oscillation is along the direction of travel. So these waves need no second dimension. And finally, of course, the real world is three dimensional so one dimensional waves are a mathematical abstraction and we shouldn't be too worried that they don't really exist."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A physics student is studying one-dimensional waves and comes across the following equation for an electromagnetic wave traveling along the x-axis:\n\n$$ E(t,x) = E_0 \\sin(\\omega t - kx) $$\n\nThe student is confused because they've been taught that waves require two dimensions to oscillate. Which of the following best explains why this equation describes a one-dimensional wave?\n\nA) The wave actually requires two dimensions, but the second dimension is implied in the amplitude E_0.\nB) This equation is incorrect and cannot represent a real wave in one dimension.\nC) The wave's amplitude represents the electromagnetic field strength at a point, not a physical displacement in space.\nD) This is a longitudinal wave, where the oscillation occurs along the direction of travel, requiring only one dimension.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Unlike mechanical waves (such as waves on a string) that require physical displacement in a second dimension to oscillate, electromagnetic waves do not need a second physical dimension to propagate. The amplitude E_0 in this equation represents the strength of the electric field at a given point in space and time, not a physical displacement. This allows the wave to be described in one dimension (x) plus time (t), without needing a second spatial dimension for its oscillation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while E_0 represents the amplitude, it's not implying a second dimension in the traditional sense.\nAnswer B is wrong because this equation is a valid representation of a one-dimensional electromagnetic wave.\nAnswer D is incorrect because electromagnetic waves are transverse, not longitudinal.

Otherwise you have to write your own such as tables/data grids for example (typically, you will have to write your own video player, good luck !). Swing is more \"modern\" as Sun engineers learned from their AWT mistakes and made something better, albeit more complex. Both Swing and AWT are event\\-based so if you know event\\-driven programming you will be at home. The learning curve is a bit steeper with Swing because of the larger number of available classes, though by practicing a bit with tutorials you should quickly be fine.\n\nCheck out this [IBM presentation on SWT, Swing \\& AWT](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/grid/library/os-swingswt/), it really is a good read.

Swing is newer and more modern than AWT, offering a larger set of components and addressing many of AWT's limitations. However, neither AWT nor Swing provides native support for video playback. For video playback in Java Swing applications, developers typically need to use additional libraries or frameworks. The question about video playback in the original post is addressed separately, indicating that it's not a built-in feature of either AWT or Swing. Option A is incorrect because it reverses the chronology and capabilities. Option C is false because AWT and Swing are not equally capable, with Swing being more feature-rich.

Even though it says \"installed software will be kept where possible,\" in my experience it cleared most of them. YMMV.\n\n**If you have `/home` in its own separate partition:**\n\nYou can either go with the above choice. \n\nOr you can choose **Something else.** If you choose \"Something else,\" make sure you check the format box for the `/` partition and uncheck the format box for `/home` partition. See below for an example.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/psm5Z.png)\n\nNote, in this picture above both the `/` and `/home` partitions are to be formatted. Make sure that **the format box for `/home` is unchecked** before you proceed. Otherwise you will lose all your data!\n\nThis method will format the `/` partition and all the extra programs you had installed in the older version will be gone. However, the settings saved in the `/home` will remain. If you decide to re\\-install some of them, say Chrome, your personal configuration, if any, should be there for the new installation to use.\n\n**Removing Cinamon and Lubuntu**\n\nIt depends on how you installed Cinamon Lubuntu etc. \n\nIf you had installed just the cinamon desktop environments (DE) and the LXDE (the DE for Lubuntu) on top of Ubuntu via **Ubuntu Software Center**, or the `apt-get` command, then yes. Either method will delete them. \n\nIf you installed these from their own LiveDVD/CD/USB in separate partitions, then no. In that case you will have to remove those partitions first. You can remove these partitions either from the LiveDVD/USB, by choosing the option **Try before installing** and then using **gparted.** Make sure you don't delete the wrong partitions. At this stage you can move the other partitions around if needed and reallocate the empty space to the version of Ubuntu you want to keep. \n\nHope this helps"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When reinstalling Ubuntu over an existing older version with /home in its own separate partition, which of the following steps should you take to preserve your personal data while ensuring a clean installation of the new system?\n\nA) Choose \"Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS\" and proceed with the installation\nB) Select \"Something else\", check the format box for both / and /home partitions\nC) Select \"Something else\", check the format box for / partition, uncheck the format box for /home partition\nD) Choose \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" to remove all partitions and start fresh\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When reinstalling Ubuntu with /home in a separate partition, selecting \"Something else\" allows for more control over the installation process.

If removing data will not work for you then you should look into imputation. Simple approaches include taking the average of the column and use that value, or if there is a heavy skew the median might be better. A better approach, you can perform regression or nearest neighbor imputation on the column to predict the missing values. Then continue on with your analysis/model.\n\nAnother approach would be to build a [RandomForest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) classifier. RandomForest models can neutrally deal with missing data by ignoring them when deciding splits. Berkeley has a good write up on [RandomForests](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm). If you choose to go down this road there is also a good paper discussing NAs in tree based models: [*An Investigation of Missing Data Methods for Classification Trees Applied to Binary Response Data*](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jsimonof/jmlr10.pdf) by Ding and Simonoff.\n\nIf you are using python, the Scipy library has an [interpolation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html) function which produces data points from within a range of known discrete data points.

This uses the fundamental group and a variation on Van Kampen, but not homology. So this probably still won't be satisfying to you, but it doesn't use Alexander duality (which is the normal way to do this). \n\nBy removing a point from the knot, we may assume that we have a properly embedded line $L\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3$. Suppose that $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$ is disconnected. Since $L$ is closed, $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$ is open, and since it is disconnected, there are disjoint non\\-empty open subsets $U, V$ such that $U\\\\cup V\\=\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$. Now embed $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^4$, with coordinates $(x,y,z,w)$, and $w\\=0$ gives $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$. Then $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^4\\-L)$ is non\\-trivial. This requires a [generalization of Van Kampen's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem#Van_Kampen.27s_theorem_for_fundamental_groups.5B1.5D) which one can find, for example, in [Peter May's book, Chapter 2\\.](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf) \n\nOne may write $\\\\mathbb{R}^4\\-L$ as a union of two simply connected open sets whose intersection is disconnected. These are $\\\\{w\\>0\\\\}\\\\cup (\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L) \\\\times (\\-1,1\\)$ and $\\\\{w\\<0\\\\}\\\\cup (\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L) \\\\times (\\-1,1\\)$. The intersection is $(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L) \\\\times (\\-1,1\\)$, which is disconnected. \n\nThen the [generalized Van Kampen's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem) implies $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^4\\-L) \\\\neq 0$. However, just as in Doyle's proof of the Jordan curve theorem, one may find a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb{R}^4$ sending $L$ to the $w$\\-axis, whose complement is simply\\-connected (move L to its graph by a homeomorphism using the [Tietze extension theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem), then project it to the $w$\\-axis; this has the same proof as Lemma 5\\.22 in [Armstrong's book](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-1793-8)).

Your post also shows the truth table that the LUT implements, indicating which configuration bit is selected for each combination of s0, s1, and s2\\. \n\nFor example, the red boxes at the intersections of the blue wires are connected to pass gates between the wires. Setting one of those to 1 will connect the horizontal and vertical wires together, setting it to 0 leaves the wires disconnected. \n\nWhat you need to do is write a 1 or a 0 in each red box so that the input signals in the green boxes at the top get sent through the logic blocks, which you'll need to configure to implement the necessary logic to perform the operation. Looks like they want you to add {a1, a0}, {b1, b0}, and ci together. \n\nHere's an example of how you can implement a 3 input OR gate:\n\n[![OR gate](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKKAJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKKAJ.png)\n\nAll blank boxes are assumed to be logic 0\\. This takes the 3 inputs a0 b0 and ci, computes the logical OR, and outputs the result on a free pin. The main things to note are how the configuration bits control the pass gates to connect the three input signals to the three inputs on the logic block and the output to a free output pin, and how the logic block implements the OR functionality \\- 0 when all inputs are 0, otherwise 1, with the flip\\-flop bypassed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the FPGA architecture described, which combination of components and configurations would be necessary to implement a 2-input XOR gate?\n\nA) Two logic blocks with their LUTs configured for XOR operation, connected directly to input and output pins\nB) One logic block with its LUT configured for XOR operation, two input pins connected to the logic block inputs, and one output pin connected to the logic block output\nC) One logic block with its LUT configured for XOR operation, two input pins connected to the logic block inputs via pass gates, one output pin connected to the logic block output via a pass gate, and appropriate configuration bits set to 1 to enable the connections\nD) Two logic blocks with their LUTs configured for AND and OR operations respectively, connected in series to implement XOR functionality\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately describes the necessary components and configurations to implement a 2-input XOR gate in the given FPGA architecture.

Rather you have made a statement that should allow a listener / reader to understand what you meant. Essentially, your conversation is drifting towards a statement, but you stop before you get there. You use the phrase to alert the listener that there is an inference to be drawn.\n\n*get my drift* is another form of this phrase.\n\nFor example:\n\nif you say:\n\n> These were obviously last year's\n>  favorites, if you get my drift.\n\ninstead of:\n\n> They are no longer in style.\n\nThe phrase has been around a long time.

Option B is the opposite of the phrase's actual meaning, as it's used for implicit rather than explicit statements.

Said traveling often causes the phone to lose all signal/web connection. I would like a system that auto\\-syncs with the phone in some fashion, can be written in a fairly wiki\\-ish style (i.e. links are supported but I don't have to actually type out also be edited easily at a regular computer when needed.

Very\\-nice\\-to\\-have is authentication so that some documents can be private, without having to get into the auth quagmire myself.\n\nThere really doesn't seem to be any such thing out there.\n\nThe two options I've thought of for implementing this:\n\n1. Now that there exists a proper 2\\-way sync dropbox app ( [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\\=com.ttxapps.dropsync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) ), I could just use a plain\\-text editor on the phone and have a simple web app that presents the text via a wiki markup library of some kind out of the relevant dropbox folder. Advantages: Dead simple. Disadvantages: No easy auth or collaboration.\n2. I could use Google Docs, and have a not\\-so\\-simple Web app that pulls documents from there, treats them as wiki text, maybe does some cashing, and presents them as a coherent\\-ish web site(s). Advantages: If I can get the auth to pass through properly, auth and collaboration are free. Disadvantages: Much more complex, and this is just a one\\-off personal project.\n\nI'm curious as to whether I've missed anything, any other easier ways to solve this problem.
