Since I completely use Linux now, Gedit was not working for me as I wanted :) Some friend recommended Emacs and that is what I want to learn.\n\nSo I have two questions:\n\n1. How do I start learning Emacs? Which tutorial should I follow? I want to be able to do most basic programming stuff (Python) without lifting my hand (as goes the quote!).\n2. When I start Emacs, the font is enlarged. I decreased that by using Cx C\\-, but how do I make the change permanent since every time it starts, the font has changed back to the original enlarged state.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tutorial\n--------\n\nOpen emacs and type `C-h t` (that is control\\-`h` followed by `t`). \n\nThat's the built in tutorial. It may help you to remember this as `C-h` invoking one of the many, many **h**elp functions an `t` being for \"tutorial\".\n\nPermanent configuration changes\n-------------------------------\n\nThe configuration is controlled by the contents of you `.emacs` file.\n\nTo learn what function `C-x C--` is running use `C-h k C-x C--`. (`C-h k` is the **h**elp with **k**ey binding function)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given Emacs documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're a new Emacs user trying to customize your setup. Which combination of actions would correctly start the built-in tutorial and permanently decrease the font size?\n\nA) Type C-h t to start the tutorial, then add (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 100) to your .emacs file\nB) Type C-x t to start the tutorial, then use M-x customize-face to decrease font size\nC) Type C-h k to start the tutorial, then add (text-scale-decrease 1) to your .emacs file\nD) Type C-t to start the tutorial, then use C-x C-- and save options\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is correct. C-h t starts the built-in Emacs tutorial, and adding the set-face-attribute command to the .emacs file will permanently decrease the font size.\n\nB) C-x t is not the correct key binding for the tutorial. M-x customize-face can change font attributes but doesn't directly address permanent font size changes.\n\nC) C-h k is for getting help on key bindings, not starting the tutorial. text-scale-decrease is temporary and not the best way to permanently change font size.\n\nD) C-t is not the correct key binding for the tutorial. While C-x C-- can decrease font size, it's a temporary change and \"save options\" is not a specific Emacs command for making this permanent.\n\nThe correct approach combines starting the tutorial with C-h t and making permanent changes through the .emacs file, which is what option A describes."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/12", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/82129", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/28354/"], "docs_id": 82129, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Mechanical Engineering Master Thesis about positioning control of a pneumatic system with Model Predictive Control. I am primarily an electrical engineer and i do not know much about electronics. I need to design an interface card in order to connect a valve (5/3 way), two pressure sensors, a linear scale to my NI\\-PCI\\-6010 data acquisition card.\n\nI have a bunch of questions about them. I tried to find solutions about them but none of them is enough for me. I wish you can help me.\n\nHowever proportional valve (<http://xdki.festo.com/xdki/data/doc_ENGB/PDF/EN/MPYE_EN.PDF>) needs to be driven with 4\\-20 mA, my PCI\\-6010 card (<http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/371498a.pdf>) doesn't support it as i understand. Its analog output have a range of \\-5 to \\+5 V, i need to convert it into 4\\-20 mA.\n\nFirst of all, do I need to convert \\-\\+5V or can I use 0\\-5V instead? I have seen lots of voltage\\-to\\-current converters in other websites, but all of them is about converting 1\\-5 V to 4\\-20 mA, I think there is an offset problem for 0\\-5V. I have found a non\\-inverting summing amplifier that can do what I want, but when input voltage reaches 5V, output current reaches 20,496 mA and this is surely a problem, also i need linearity.\n\nI have found an IC that can convert 0\\-5 V to 4\\-20 mA (XTR110, I think you all have a word to say about it), but I cannot wait to purchase it, because i couldn't find any distributor in my country. So that I want to design a PCB in order to get over this problem.\n\nAlso I don't want to use a passive voltage\\-to\\-current converter. Here is the circuit I designed.\n\n![0-5 V to 4-20 mA Converter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKRne.png)\n\nV1 \\= 5 V, Vref \\= 1 V (for offset problem)\n\nAlso; when V1 \\= 0V, output current is 4,037 mA. But it is not a big problem. Other values are;\n\nV1\\=1 V, Iout\\=7,329 mA\n\nV1\\=2 V, Iout\\=10,62 mA\n\n**V1\\=2\\.5 V, Iout\\=12,267 mA**\n\nV1\\=3 V, Iout\\=13,912 mA\n\nV1\\=4 V, Iout\\=17,204 mA\n\nAs you see, I cannot achieve a setpoint value for my valve too (It needs 12 mA for middle position).\n\nOf course I don't want you to do my thesis for me, but I stuck on early stage of my thesis and if I cannot found a solution about it I absolutely have a real bad time.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't recommend you to use the design in the picture. OAs ( Operational Amplifier) are good for Voltage gain and High impedance output, but not to \"play\" with current, the current output is sensible with the components tolerance. Try to simulate your circuits with variation of 5% in your devices (resistors \\& VCC) and see the output. When you will buy the components they will have deviations about 1% to 5%, depend on the quality of the materials you will buy.\n\nTransistors are the devices to play with current gains, but impedance could be the problem. \n\nSee also the tolerance for the Valve mid\\-position for current, it is 1\\.3%:\n\n```\nVoltage type [V DC] 5 (\u00b10.1)\nCurrent type [mA] 12 (\u00b10.16)\n\n```\n\nYour are right the 12\\.267 mA are not correct ( max. acceptable would be 12\\.16 mA), take this into consideration because it means: **the tolerance current output of your circuit must be max. 1\\.3%!!!.**\n\nIt could means also that maybe temperature compensation of your output must be implemented depend on the range of temperature where the device will operate and ICs you will use.\n\nI have seen the Page 6 Datasheet of the valve: \n\n```\nSetpoint value\nVoltage type [V DC] 0 \u2026 10\nCurrent type [mA] 4 \u2026 20\n\n```\n\nWhy don't you try to control the valve with \"Voltage type\"? I think it is easier to transform your \\+\\-5V to a 0\\-10 Volt linear signal with mid\\-position on 5V. And you have a little more tolerance (2%) requirement for your output. It is easy, you can use an OA adder with a two inputs: one a \\+5V offset and the second your \\+\\-5V signal (you must check the tolerance)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an interface to control a pneumatic valve using a data acquisition card.

This approach avoids the complexities and tight tolerances required for current conversion. It suggests using an operational amplifier adder circuit to convert the card's -5V to +5V output to 0-10V, which is easier to implement and has more relaxed tolerance requirements (2% vs 1.3% for current).

You might also want to track down the program that created them (using information from `ipcs -s -i <id>`) to make sure it's not leaking semaphores. In my experience, though, most leaks come from programs that were interrupted (by segfaults or similar) before they could run their cleanup code.\n\nIf your system really needs all of the semaphores currently allocated, you can increase the number of semaphores available. Run `sysctl -a | grep kernel.sem` to see what the current settings are. The final number is the number of semaphores available on the system (normally 128\\). Copy that line into `/etc/sysctl.conf`, change the final number to a larger value, save it, and run `sysctl -p` to load the new settings."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting issues with Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) on a Red Hat 5.1 64-bit server with a PERC 5/i controller.

That translator relies on pull\\-up resistors, which are not really suitable for faster signals. 9600 baud will be OK. This is how you'd wire it up:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pWAiL.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fpWAiL.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nYou are *not* correct when you state that you need a bi\\-directional level shifter, because the signals are not bi\\-directional. What you have is two uni\\-directional signals.\n\nRead up on [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) for an example of bi\\-directional signalling, where device pins can act as both inputs and outputs. In your application, I assume TX is always an output, and RX is always an input.\n\nIn your application you could get away with two unidirectional translators, one to shift a 5V output down to 3\\.3V suitable for the other device's input, and the other to go from 3\\.3V output to a 5V signal for the other device's input.\n\nThat might look like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKVHK.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOKVHK.png)\n\nTranslator U1 has an input expecting 0V or 5V, but outputs only a 0V or 3\\.3V signal. U2 should take a 3\\.3V level input and output a 5V version.\n\nThere are many ICs you can use to shift between signal levels. Check out the [74LVC125](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc125a.pdf?ts=1634219286379), [CD4504](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4504b.pdf?ts=1634219488759) for example. If you wish to convert 3\\.3V output signals to 5V, any 74HCTxx gate will do the trick, like the [74HCT08](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct08.pdf?ts=1634212114898) or [74HCT32](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct32.pdf?ts=1634220047788). You could even invert, using a [74HCT04](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct04.pdf) or [74HCT00](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct00.pdf).\n\nThe main advantages of using dedicated ICs like these to perform level shifting, rather than a MOSFET with pull\\-up resistors (like the SparkFun board), are speed and power. They'll be able to switch much faster, at several megahertz, with sharper transistions, while being able to sink *and* source much more current.\n\nUp to a few tens or hundreds of kilohertz, the SparkFun board will work just fine, and you only need one unit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a system where an ESP32 (3.3V logic) needs to communicate via serial with a 5V display.

Then $\\\\gamma$ is the average treatment effect (ATE) conditional on $X$.\n\nNow let $Y\\=TY^T\\+(1\\-T)Y^C$, where $Y^T$ is the outcome in treamtent group and $Y^C$ is the outcome in control group. The primary assumption, which is exploited by ANCOVA, is that the outcome variables $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ are independent from $T$ conditional on $X$. This is also called 'unconfoundedness' written as:\n\n$$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C,X)\\=P(T\\|X)$$\n\nOtherwise outcome variables and treatment assignment are confounded and (conditional) mean differences on $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ may be caused by other factors than the manipulation (i.e., *even given* $X$). If $T$ and $Y^C$ and $Y^T$ are unconfounded conditional on $X$, the ATE estimate $\\\\gamma$ from ANCOVA will be unbiased given that also all other model assumptions are met. \n\nYou may ask when it is clear whether there is unconfoundedness: this can never be assessed with absolute certainty and it represents the key weakness of adjustment for bias in observational studies. It is recommended (see ref. below) that you include all covariates that are even in tendency (p\\<.10\\) statistically associated (correlated) with either $T$, $Y^C$ or $Y^T$. This suggests that it is not problematic, rather desirable, that $X$ and $T$ are correlated when using ANCOVA (**your first question**). \n\nIn fact, the correlation of covariate(s) with dependent variable 'within the groups' (i.e., $X$ with $Y^C$ or $Y^T$) is an indication that the unconfoundedness assumption holds or is more plausible (**your second question**). But correlation with $T$ likewise indicates this. However: an 'ideal' $X$ covariate is associated to, both, treatment indicator and outcome variables. Since ANOVA does not include $X$ (**your third question**), it would assume unconfoundedness unconditional $X$, i.e., $$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C)\\=P(T)$$which is a very strong assumption and dependence of $X$ and $T$ would point to its potential violation. It is therefore not recommended in your hypothetical situation and should be preserved to fully randomized experiments, in which any $X$ by definition is independent of treatment and criterion variables.\n\nIt is important to note that meeting all of the **other model assumptions** of ANCOVA is required to find unbiased ATE estimates (e.g., using least squares estimators). Chiefly, this suggests that there is **no interaction** between $T$ and $X$. This is sometimes referred to as effect homogeneity (as opposed to hetorogenous effects, if there is an interaction). Therefore, the model should at least include the interactions as well, which is not standard in ANCOVA models. Furthermore, you assume linearity (inspect residuals to check this assumption) and you also assume that the Y\\-model is correct (i.e., that you included all relevant $X$ to model $Y$). \n\nSometimes, propensity score methods and nonparametric matching methods are superior to ANCOVA because they do not feature the linearity assumption and can include interactions 'on the go'. Moreover, so\\-called double\\-robust methods combine Y\\-modeling with propensity score methods. They guarantee unbiased effect estimates even if the model for $Y$ is incorrect (assuming the propensity score model is correct).

Two I have come across are K\\-fold and Monte Carlo cross\\-validation techniques. I have read that K\\-fold is a variation on Monte Carlo but I'm not sure I fully understand what makes up the definition of Monte Carlo. Could someone please explain the distinction between these two methods?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $k$\\-Fold Cross Validation\n--------------------------\n\nSuppose you have 100 data points. For $k$\\-fold cross validation, these 100 points are divided into $k$ equal sized and mutually\\-exclusive 'folds'. For $k$\\=10, you might assign points 1\\-10 to fold \\#1, 11\\-20 to fold \\#2, and so on, finishing by assigning points 91\\-100 to fold \\#10\\. Next, we select one fold to act as the test set, and use the remaining $k\\-1$ folds to form the training data. For the first run, you might use points 1\\-10 as the test set and 11\\-100 as the training set. The next run would then use points 11\\-20 as the test set and train on points 1\\-10 plus 21\\-100, and so forth, until each fold is used once as the test set.\n\nMonte\\-Carlo Cross Validation\n-----------------------------\n\nMonte Carlo works somewhat differently. You randomly select (without replacement) some fraction of your data to form the training set, and then assign the rest of the points to the test set. This process is then repeated multiple times, generating (at random) new training and test partitions each time. For example, suppose you chose to use 10% of your data as test data. Then your test set on rep \\#1 might be points 64, **90**, 63, **42**, 65, 49, 10, 64, 96, and 48\\. On the next run, your test set might be **90**, 60, 23, 67, 16, 78, **42**, 17, 73, and 26\\. Since the partitions are done independently for each run, the same point can appear in the test set multiple times, *which is the major difference between Monte Carlo and cross validation*.\n\nComparison\n----------\n\nEach method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Under cross validation, each point gets tested exactly once, which seems fair. However, cross\\-validation only explores a few of the possible ways that your data could have been partitioned. Monte Carlo lets you explore somewhat more possible partitions, though you're unlikely to get all of them\\-\\-there are $\\\\binom{100}{50} \\\\approx 10^{28}$ possible ways to 50/50 split a 100 data point set(!). \n\nIf you're attempting to do inference (i.e., statistically compare two algorithms), averaging the results of a $k$\\-fold cross validation run gets you a (nearly) unbiased estimate of the algorithm's performance, but with high variance (as you'd expect from having only 5 or 10 data points). Since you can, in principle, run it for as long as you want/can afford, Monte Carlo cross validation can give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.\n\nSome approaches fuse the two, as in the 5x2 cross validation (see [Dietterich (1998\\)](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089976698300017197) for the idea, though I think there have been some further improvements since then), or by correcting for the bias (e.g., [Nadeau and Bengio, 2003](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/pub_subject/finance/pointeurs/techrep.pdf))."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing k-fold cross-validation with Monte Carlo cross-validation for a dataset of 100 points.

This is something that then starts to *look* like one that is going to delve too far into code or fix my code/design type questions.\n\nMany of the questions that tend to be \"here is a lot of code\" tend to get answers that are \"here is a lot of code too.\" Those answers aren't ideal for P.SE, and so questions that ask them may get down voted.\n3.

While I can't really speak about the actual business problem, I can give a few reasons for why we think that Event Sourcing might be a good fit:\n\n* great auditing capabilities based on the history of events\n* \"travelling back in time\" to recreate a previous state of an aggregate (e.g. for debugging purposes)\n* the ability to create new projections that take the full history into account\n\nSince I can't go into detail about the exact domain we're in, I will describe my problem using the domain described [in this Kata dealing with quiz games](https://playingwithprojections.github.io/doc/domain/).\n\nI think I got the general idea of Event Sourcing and how CQRS links to it. However, all examples I can find use domains with clear separations between aggregates as well as between different instances of the same aggregate (in the Kata mentioned above, quizzes and games have a clear relationship. There's no interdependence between different quizzes or different games).\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nIn my case I have the problem that it must be possible to **merge different instances of the same aggregate** (in our sample domain this could mean that it must be possible to merge different quizzes together into one quiz) as well as undoing this merge later on (reconstructing the two original quizzes from the merged one).\n\nThis constraint adds quite some complexity when it comes to constructing the current state of an aggregate, because it's necessary to read the whole event stream from the beginning to be sure that all relevant events are taken into consideration. It's not possible to partition the event stream in a useful way because it's impossible to tell which aggregates will be merged later in the future. It might even be a problem when the event stream gets partitioned, because the temporal order of related events gets lost.  \n\nFrom what I understand, partitioning the event stream allows for a fast provision of the events that are necessary to build up the current state of an aggregate. For instance, if I want to know the current state of the quiz with ID `124ecf`, I technically could filter the event streams to just have the events for this exact ID which would drastically reduce the number of events. If this is not possible, like in my case, reading the event stream ad hoc to recreate the state of an aggregate will become very slow and impractical over time.\n\nThe solution I came up with so far\n----------------------------------\n\nThe only solution for this problem that seems to be possible to me is to work with rolling snapshots for all necessary projections. The snapshots would update themselves continuously, building up a state optimized for their specific use case (processing commands, answering queries etc.).  \n\nI'm skeptical about this idea, because it requires quite some effort. Most of the implementations of typical applications don't require rolling snapshots for most use cases because building up the desired state from the event stream is fast enough. This simplicity is lost in my case.\n\nThe question\n------------\n\nMy question could be split up in several parts:\n\n* Is it a good idea to use Event Sourcing for domains like these where it's not possible to draw clear boundaries between different instances of the same aggregate?\n* Does it make sense to heavily rely on using rolling snapshots to get the desired performance?\n* Is there another way other than rolling snapshots to implement this?\n* I can't think of a way for partitioning the event stream. Am I missing something? Are there some techniques that allow partitioning/sharding under the given circumstances?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your analogy is intereseting and heading in the right direction. \n\n> Microservices are like user space drivers\n\nYes and no: \n\n* Yes, like [user\\-mode drivers](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:overviewofminixarchitecture), microservices provide an independent functionality in their own tiny and independent process. Minix drivers run as independent process to offer a functionality that would otherwise be (or at least run as a) part of a monolotithic kernel.\n* No, because user\\-mode drivers are archtiectured around the microkernel. Remove the microkernel and the full architecture is useless. The microservice archtiecture, is not a star around a central component, but a mesh. Every microservice has its value by its own. Shutting down any of them should still leave an overall system that provides some (less) value.\n* No, because microservices can be used to scale, so that you run several instances on different machines of the same service. I doubt that you would run in parrallel 2 keyboard drivers to increase throughput.\n\n> Microservices adds communication overhead\n\nYes, and it's a lot of message passing like on the Minix kernel. The API of microservices might however be of a higher level of abstraction, thius more complex, and based on more complex types. The communication overhead will be more significant than what you are used to for an OS microkernel with its device drivers. (*and the [overhead for switching between user\\-mode and kernel\\-mode](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198874-lessons-learned-from-30-years-of-minix/fulltext), which was one of the performance reason why MINIX didn't become mainstream, can be neglected in comparison*). \n\n> Microservices can be partially upgraded without downtime  \n> \n>  Microservices does not need to speak HTTP.\n\nYes, exactly"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between microservices and user-space drivers in operating systems?\n\nA) Microservices and user-space drivers are identical in all aspects of their architecture and implementation.\n\nB) Microservices and user-space drivers both run as independent processes, but microservices form a mesh architecture while user-space drivers are centered around a microkernel.\n\nC) Microservices have less communication overhead compared to user-space drivers due to their higher level of abstraction.\n\nD) Microservices cannot be partially upgraded without downtime, unlike user-space drivers.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because while there are similarities, microservices and user-space drivers are not identical in all aspects.\n\nOption B is correct.

The pathname shall not contain any unnecessary `<slash>` characters after the leading one or two `<slash>` characters.\n\nOf course, it's possible to infer the meaning of *logical* and *physical* to these two flags, and the GNU coreutils version of this utility even has these two words as long options.\n\nSo the answer is \"logical path\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Unix systems, which of the following best describes a pathname that may contain symbolic links and is typically used by the 'pwd' command with the '-L' option?\n\nA) Physical path\nB) Absolute pathname\nC) Logical path\nD) Relative pathname\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe question tests understanding of Unix pathnames and the 'pwd' command options.

This corresponds to the behavior of 'pwd' with the '-L' option, which can output a path containing symbolic links if present in the PWD environment variable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a \"physical path\" would typically resolve all symbolic links, which is not the behavior described for the '-L' option.\n\nOption B, \"absolute pathname,\" refers to a path starting with a slash character, but doesn't specifically relate to the handling of symbolic links.\n\nOption C, \"logical path,\" is the correct answer as it best matches the description of a path that may contain symbolic links, as used by 'pwd -L'.\n\nOption D, \"relative pathname,\" refers to a path not beginning with a slash, which is not relevant to the 'pwd' command's output or the handling of symbolic links."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/18", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/433268", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/218604/"], "docs_id": 433268, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to figure out the braking torque calculation for a BLDC simulation.\nNow if I'm looking at a datasheet I know the torque at a given rpm at acceleration.\nIf I brake with regenerative breaking is that the torque at a given rpm as at acceleration?

This suggests that PercC shows the most pronounced difference in the percentage profiles.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the analysis uses a linear regression model, not a chi-square test.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the coefficient for subjectB is essentially zero (-2.631e-17) with a p-value of 1.000, indicating no significant effect of subject group on the profiles.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the subject group doesn't show a significant effect, there are significant differences in the percentages themselves, particularly for PercB and PercC."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/13", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/252065", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/99656/"], "docs_id": 252065, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my problem, I have two inputs: a binary matrix $M$ of size $m\\\\times n$ and an integer $k\\\\geq 1$.\n\nLet $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ be subspaces of $\\\\mathbb{R}^k$ with $1\\\\leq\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq k$ and $1\\\\leq\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k$ for all $i\\=1,...,m$ and $j\\=1,...,n$.\n\nThe matrix $M$ indicates how the subspaces $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ must intersect.\nWhen $M(i,j)\\=0$, it means that $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ are orthogonal to each other, that is, $S\\_i\\\\perp T\\_j$.\nWhen $M(i,j)\\=1$, it means that $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ are not orthogonal, that is, $S\\_i\\\\not\\\\perp T\\_j$.\n\n> My question is the following: given an integer $k$ and a matrix $M$, what can we say about the dimensions of the subspaces?\n\nFor example, it is obvious that when $M(i,j)\\=0$, it leads to the inequality $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\+\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k$ meaning that we can obtain stronger upper bounds: $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq \\\\color{red}{k\\-1}$ and $\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq \\\\color{red}{k\\-1}$.\n\nMy problem concerns more particularly the following example with $k\\=3$ and $M\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1 \\& 1 \\& 0\\\\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nI am pretty sure that this matrix implies to have $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\=\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\=1$ for $i,j\\=1,...4$ but I am not able to prove it.\n\nMaybe, with the special sparsity pattern of $M$ (multiple zeros per row/column), would it possible to show that it implies $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq k\\-2$ and $\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k\\-2$ for $i,j\\=1,...4$?\n\nThank you very much for any advice!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In your specific example we easily get that all 8 subspaces are non\\-zero (else we would have all\\-1s row or column), and none of $S\\_i$ contains another $S\\_j$ (since there exists a subspace orthogonal to $S\\_i$ but not to $S\\_j$.)

When a new vertical list is being built (and the OR starts a new vertical list) TeX reinitializes `\\prevdepth` and when processing ends it resets it to the old (outer) value.\n\nWith normal output routines (that ship out pages) that's okay as the `\\prevdepth` (after the output routine ends) will match the last box on the main vertical list if there is a remainder that was not put into box255\\. If the main vertical list is empty the value is wrong but that doesn't make a difference because TeX will use `\\topskip` on top of the first line so it is essentially ignored.\n\nBut the situation is different if the output routine puts material back to be reprocessed. In that case the last box on the main vertical list is a) either the box that was not used in the OR and that has a depth matching `\\prevdepth` or it is the last box from the stuff that the OR contributed (which may have a different depth).\n\nSo to make baselineskip calculations work correctly we would need to know which situation we are in: has everything been packaged into box255 or is there an unused remainder? If that question could be answered that would also solve the issue but this is to my knowledge not possible.\n\nAn alternative solution would be to pretend that the material generated by the OR has the same depth as the outer `\\prevdepth` but for this I would somehow need to know its value.\nKnowing its value is simple if we force the OR with an explicit penalty because then I can just save it and used the saved value. But what can be done if the OR is called by TeX on its own?\n\nThat's really the question above ... any idea (as sneaky as it needs to be) to somehow get at this value in this particular case?\n\nOr alternatively, any method to clearly determine whether or not the main vertical list is emptied.\n\nPlease note that I'm looking for a solution that works with all TeX engines, so doesn't make use of, say, lua programming.\n\nTo motivate a bit further, here is a short plain TeX file that shows the general problem (though here it could be fixed as we explicitly force the output routine):\n\n```\n\\tracingonline=1\n\\showboxbreadth\\maxdimen\\showboxdepth\\maxdimen\n\ntest with g to get a depth\n\n\\showthe\\prevdepth % we see the prevdepth from the last line\n\n% now assume we have some OR that traps the data and does something with it\n% afterwards it is pushing back new or changed data t build pages, In the example I\n% simply dropped the collected data and replaced it with soemthing else which has a different \n% \\prevdepth.

In that case we can use the depth of box 255 as a measure for the `\\prevdepth`calculations that will have taken place if there is any remainder in recent contributions, and use this to adjust the new depth to match that. An if there isn't any remainder then this doesn't really matter either. This trick is in fact already mentioned by Don Knuth in the TeXbook where he discusses an output routine that add index headings in random places in the text (and normal text has this nice property of having a depth smaller than `\\maxdepth` ... normally but unfortunately not always.\n\nHowever, this stops working if this can't guaranteed and the general case is what I was and am after. He is also correct in stating that finding out what the value of `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list is isn't really going to help us as such, so my question above was partly incorrect: we also need to know if there is in fact something on the recent contributions and if so deal with it.\n\nSo what I tried to get my head around over the last days if that is really impossible to find out within base TeX (or if it needs an extension in luatex or is already available there and resolved in ConTeXt ... would be interesting to learn about it beside that claim @Martin you made). And as it stands now it is possible in TeX after all. The solution is a bit complex and perhaps it can be simplified further but it is not so complex that it can't be used (and hopefully not too complex that I overlooked some cases).\n\nThe main idea is not to try to determine the situation directly but instead use 2 output routines in succession that just ensure that the recent contributions are empty. Along the way we gather enough information to afterwards dissect the material gathered and do whatever we like.\n\nMy initial idea of using `\\aftergroup` to regain control and have a look doesn't work because the token inserted that way will not be executed when the output routine ends. Instead TeX immediately calls again on a procedure \"buildpage\" that takes anything on recent contributions and moves it to the main vertical list and only once that has happened my inserted token is looked at (in other words too late).\n\nSo the more complicated approach is that the first OR puts box255 back but only it has changed `\\vsize` to the largest possible dimen. Additionally it uses `\\aftergroup` so that we gain control later again. As we have changed `\\vsize` we will get everything including the material recent contributions onto the main vertical list and only then our control token kicks in. Finally we change the output routine to a second one and then return.\n\nThe token inserted by `\\aftergroup` will then issue a forcing penalty (actually it does a little more, see below) so that everything is grabbed and the second OR is called.\n\nInside that OR we are now in a better situation:\n\n* we know that recent contributions is empty (except for a (`\\penalty 10000`)\n* we can store away what was gathered in box255\n* or we could manipulate it using `\\vsplit` etc to get, for example the amount split of that we would have gotten in the first OR\n* and we can use `\\aftergroup` to gain control after the OR has ended.\n* the latter allows us to change `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list to represent whatever is needed\n\nAnd that should (I believe) do the trick completely.\n\nHere is the (more or less documented code including a bit of test data to play out various scenarios). It is a bit longish but largely because I tried to properly document the most important aspects and some of the more subtle points.

It will also accept a command line argument (described later under **Optional pattern matching argument**).\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d','-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\nelse:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d',\\\n            '-name',sys.argv[1], '-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\ncounts = []\nfor name in folder:\n    counts.append(sum(name in i[:len(name)] for i in folder))\ncounts = sorted(list(zip(counts,folder)),reverse=True)\nif counts[0][0]>1:\n    sys.stdout.buffer.write(counts[0][1]+b'\\x0a')\n\n```\n\nSave the script (e.g. as `mainfoldername.py` or whatever) and the command `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output the folder name that meets the criteria of occuring most often as the starting string in folder names in the current working directory. If no folders meet that criteria, the script produces no output.\n\nWith the example directories you've given, `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output **`./Target.Dire ctoryName`**.\n\nUsing **command expansion**, a variable can be set to the script's output value and used in other commands:\n\n```\n$ myvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n$ echo \"$myvar\"\n./Target.Dire ctoryName\n$ cd \"$myvar\"\nTarget.Dire ctoryName$\n\n```\n\nShell script usage\n------------------\n\nIn **shell scripts** that will use this output, a check for cases where no folder names met the criteria (i.e. the python script produced no output) should be included by testing the value for zero length, e.g:\n\n```bsh\n#!/bin/sh\nmyvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n[ ! -z \"$myvar\" ] || exit 1\n\n```\n\nOptional pattern matching argument\n----------------------------------\n\n`python3 /path/to/mainfolder.py PATTERN`\n\nThis script will accept one optional argument on the command line where *`PATTERN`* is a shell pattern that folder names must match.\n\nThe most basic use of this is as a switch between finding regular folders or finding hidden folders. The script's default behavior is to find all folders.\n\n**To find only hidden folders**, use **`'.*'`** for *`PATTERN`*:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '.*'\n\n```\n\n**To find only non\\-hidden folders**, use **`'[!\\.]*'`**\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '[!\\.]*'\n\n```\n\nIt's also useful when you know some string that will appear in the target folder's name.\n\n**To find only folders whose names contain the string `Target`**:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '*Target*'\n\n```\n\nNote that the patterns should always be contained in quotes to avoid expansion by the shell.

It's IIS 7, not 7\\.5\\.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can not disable individual handler mappings in the UI. The 'Edit Feature Permissions' mentioned by Mark Henderson applies to the whole feature 'Handler Mappings', so it applies to all mappings, not a single one.\n\nThere are really three groups of handlers, one that requires Execute permission such as, 'ISAPI\\-dll' or 'CGI\\-exe', the second group that requires 'Script' permissions, all the asp.net handlers are in that group. The third group of handlers only requires 'Read' permission, 'StaticFile' is an example of this. Because it does not execute a process nor does it run a script, it just reads a file from the file system.\n\nYou can check this by open 'Edit Feature Permissions' and uncheck 'Script', most of the mappings are now disabled. Uncheck 'Read' and the last few enabled ones are disabled as well.\n\nTo remove a handler from a site, open the web.config and add something like this:\n\n```\n<system.webServer>\n    <handlers>\n      <remove name=\"PageHandlerFactory-Integrated-4.0\"/>\n    </handlers>\n</system.webServer>  \n\n```\n\nThis will remove the integrate ASP.NET 4 page handler, which means web forms (aspx) will no longer work.\n\nIf you look at the 'Handler Mappings' for the same site in IIS Manager, that mapping still shows up in the enabled section, even though it does no longer work for the site."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are managing an IIS 7 web server and need to disable specific file extensions without completely removing them from the server configuration.

According to the documentation, you cannot disable individual handler mappings through the IIS Manager user interface. The 'Edit Feature Permissions' option affects all handler mappings, not specific ones. The most effective way to disable specific file extensions for a particular website is to add <remove> elements in the web.config file for each handler you want to disable. This method allows you to target specific handlers without affecting others, and it's applied at the website level rather than server-wide.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would affect all scripts, not just specific extensions. Option B is not possible as the UI doesn't allow moving individual handlers between Enabled and Disabled sections.

This means that any piece of the disk would experience a force proportional to its area. Keep this in mind.\n\nFurthermore since the torque created by the friction at any point is proportional to this point's distance to the center of the disk, it makes sense to model the disk as many concentric rings. The reason this is sensible is that both the area of such a ring, thus the force on the ring, and the distance for all the points on it to the center can be written in terms of the radius of each ring. Thus it is easy to express the torque on each ring which is just the product of the distance and the force.\n\nThen you can add all the disks back together to acquire the total torque on the disk. This simply means integrating with respect to r from 0 to R.\n\nThis is a sketch of the friction forces acting on different points. Note even they all have the same magnitude, the ones closer to the rim creates a larger torque. Also note all of them creates a torque in the same direction.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A uniform circular disk of radius R is rotating on a horizontal surface with angular velocity \u03c9.

The disk can be modeled as many concentric rings, and the total torque can be found by integrating the torque contributions from these rings from the center (r = 0) to the edge (r = R).\n\nD is incorrect because in this scenario, the friction force is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the disk's surface, not proportional to the angular velocity of each point."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/06", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/220423", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/74396/"], "docs_id": 220423, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> And because diversions scale so easily\u2014after all, who doesn\u2019t want to\n>  post selfies on Instagram?\u2014wealth becomes extremely concentrated in\n>  fewer hands.\n\nAs you know the word [Scale](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scale) as a verb has many meanings:\n\n* to weigh in scales\n* to remove the scale or scales from\n* to take off in thin layers or scales\n* to throw (something, such as a thin, flat stone) so that the edge\ncuts the air or so that it skips on water\n* to attack with or take by means of scaling ladders\n* to climb up or reach by means of a ladder\n* to reach the highest point of : SURMOUNT\n* to arrange in a graduated series\n* to measure by or as if by a scale\n* to pattern, make, regulate, set, or estimate according to some rate\nor standard : ADJUST\n\nSo, Could you tell me please which one explains the sentence?\n\nThe fuller text:\n\n> There\u2019s one last component to this harebrained theory that I still\n>  haven\u2019t spoken about: inequality.

So, more than deriving the MLEs (which is straightforward), I would say that this is a good example in order to examine whether pooling samples (**\"unite and conquer\"?**) is more beneficial than keeping the samples separate (**\"divide and conquer\"?**). But \"more beneficial\" according to which criteria? \n\nWe will discuss them as we go along.\n\nNote that we need both sample sizes to be larger than unity, $n\\_1 \\>1, n\\_2 \\> 1$, otherwise the variance estimator will equal zero.\n\nIf we keep the samples separate we will obtain\n\n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}v\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}(v\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v)^2$$\n\nand \n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}w\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}(w\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w)^2$$\n\nThe MLEs for the means will be unbiased, efficient, consistent and asymptotically normal.\n\nThe variance estimators will be biased, consistent and asymptotically normal (see [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/105337/asymptotic-distribution-of-sample-variance-of-non-normal-sample), which holds in general, even for normal samples).\n\nSince we have bias here, it is an easy thought to turn to Mean Squared Error. The populations are normal, so we also have a finite\\-sample result:\n\n$$\\\\frac {n\\_i\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\sim \\\\chi^2\\_{n\\_i\\-1} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Gamma}(k\\_i,\\\\theta\\_i),\\\\;\\\\; k\\_i \\= \\\\frac {n\\_i\\-1}{2},\\\\;\\\\; \\\\theta\\_i \\= \\\\frac {2\\\\sigma^2}{n\\_i},\\\\;\\\\;i\\=1,2$$\n\nTherefore we can calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as\n\n$$MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i) \\= \\\\text{Var}(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i)\\+\\\\left\\[B(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i)\\\\right]^2 \\= \\\\frac{2(n\\_i\\-1\\)}{n\\_i^2} \\\\sigma^4 \\+ \\\\frac 1{n\\_i^2}\\\\sigma^4 \\= \\\\frac{2n\\_i\\-1}{n\\_i^2} \\\\sigma^4$$\n\n**We turn now to the pooled\\-samples case**.  \n\nIt is easy to verify that the MLE's for the two means will be *identical* with the separate\\-samples approach. So as regards these estimators, pooling the two samples or not, makes no difference as regards the functional form of the estimators, or their properties.\n\nBut the variance estimator will be different. It is also rather easy to derive that\n\n$$\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2$$\n\nThis is also a biased an consistent estimator, and also asymptotically normal, being the convex combination of two asymptotically normal variables.\n\nTurning to the issue of bias and Mean Squared Error, since the two separate\\-samples estimators are independent we have that\n\n$$\\\\text{Var}(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1^2}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\frac{2(n\\_1\\-1\\)}{n\\_1^2} \\\\sigma^4\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2^2}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\frac{2(n\\_2\\-1\\)}{n\\_2^2}\\\\sigma^4 \\= \\\\frac {2n\\_1\\+2n\\_2\\-4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\sigma^4$$\n\nand\n\n$$B\\\\left(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}E(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1\\)\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}E(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2\\) \\- \\\\sigma^2 \\= \\\\frac {\\-2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2} \\\\sigma^2$$\n\nSo the MSE here is \n\n$$MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\= \\\\frac {2n\\_1\\+2n\\_2\\-4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\sigma^4\\+\\\\frac {4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2} \\\\sigma^4 \\= \\\\frac {2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\sigma^4$$\n\n**In order for sample\\-pooling to be superior in MSE terms** we want that\n\n$$MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\< MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i), i\\=1,2$$\n\n$$\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac {2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\sigma^4 \\< \\\\frac{2n\\_i\\-1}{n\\_i^2} \\\\sigma^4 \\\\Rightarrow 2n\\_i^2 \\< 2n\\_in\\_1 \\- n\\_1 \\+ 2n\\_in\\_2 \\- n\\_2$$\n\nThis reduces to the same condition for either $i\\=1$ or $i\\=2$, namely\n$$0 \\< \\- n\\_1 \\+ 2n\\_1n\\_2 \\- n\\_2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac {n\\_1\\+n\\_2}{n\\_1n\\_2} \\< 2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac 1{n\\_2} \\+ \\\\frac {1}{n\\_1} \\< 2$$\n\nwhich holds, since both sample sizes are strictly higher than unity.\n\nTherefore we conclude, that **\"unite \\& conquer\" is the MSE\\-efficient approach here**. \n\n**But we will lose something**: if $n\\_1 \\\\neq n\\_2$ the pooled\\-sample variance estimator does not give a Gamma finite sample distributional result, because it is the linear combination of two Gamma random variables *with different scale parameters* (different $\\\\theta\\_i$'s). This does not result into a Gamma, but into a rather complicated infinite sum expression (see [this paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02481123?LI=true)).

The first is to note that `EEMEM` just pre\\-allocates variables into the EEPROM memory space, and you can just as easily use the actual memory addresses in the various `eeprom_` api functions. So you could create a table of `#define` constants for the variables you require and access them this way. The only real disadvantage is that you need to keep track of how each variable is allocated, but as soon as you require fixed allocations then you'll have to do this anyway.\n\nIf you only require part of the memory to have fixed allocation and the rest you want the compiler to sort out, you can create a new linker section, for example, called `.eepromfixed`. You could allocate say the first 256 bytes of EEPROM to this section and use it for manually allocated variables (as described above), and then use the regular EEPROM section for anything else."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing firmware for an embedded system that uses EEPROM for non-volatile storage. You need to allocate some variables at fixed addresses in EEPROM, while allowing the compiler to manage the allocation of other EEPROM variables. Which of the following approaches would best achieve this goal?\n\nA) Use only the EEMEM attribute for all EEPROM variables and let the compiler handle all allocations.\n\nB) Create a new linker section called .eepromfixed for manually allocated variables, use the first 256 bytes of EEPROM for this section, and use the regular EEPROM section for compiler-managed variables.\n\nC) Use #define constants for all EEPROM variable addresses and manually manage all EEPROM allocations.\n\nD) Use inline assembly to directly access EEPROM addresses for all variables.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B provides the best solution for the given requirements. By creating a new linker section (.eepromfixed) for manually allocated variables and using the first 256 bytes of EEPROM for this purpose, you can have precise control over the placement of critical variables. At the same time, using the regular EEPROM section for other variables allows the compiler to manage their allocation, providing flexibility for less critical data.

I'm proposing that we take a look at what makes sites successful, and then what should make site successful, and see if we can shrink the distance between the two. Given this approach, I believe we can make the site a better place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What makes a site successful?\n\n1. Finding a community of users already within Stack Exchange, who are willing to put a bit of time and effort into the process.\n2. A short proposal/ commitment time, made possible by \\#1\\.\n3. A clearly defined scope, that can attract a reasonable number of users.\n4. A scope which there is a large number of questions, which can be reasonably easily found.\n5. Having advocates for a site tends to make it work better.\n6. Steady progress towards the goal.\n7. Maintaining interest in the site\n8. Some kind of critical mass seems to help, once the site is moving, people get excited about it, and help spread the word.\n\nProof of this:\n\n1. [Stack Overflow in Portuguese](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23539/stack-overflow-in-portuguese?referrer=2cEbomCluXXY236h5e0UuA2)\\- Destined to die until a user started referring people, who believed in the site. Now it is well on its way to success.\n2. Logic Design clearly shows a limited, but good scope, and slow and stead progress towards goals. Activity is shown by the number of questions asked about it.\n3. [Politics](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/25906/politics?referrer=BI9Ll_aP-kRVLwgiGK_kNg2) is slowly on its way to death, with a somewhat inactive creator and no one really spreading the word about the site.\n4. [Chinese Emigration](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36960/chinese-emigration-?referrer=fEydiZ6VRdfFiZVRcftP7w2)\\- Huge interest initially, but not from within SE. Without SE support, it will likely wither and die.\n5. [Smugmug](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/25069?phase=commitment)\\- Huge initial interest, it took over a year to get the site to beta. By that time, the original interest had drained away, leaving the site to wither. The site is alive, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if it died soon.\n\nWhat should be the metrics?\n\n1. A minimum number of users is required.\n2. How much does the community seem to be forming before the community has officially started?\n3. Some number of users willing to help police the site.\n4. Length of time seems important, perhaps length of time since last visit.\n\nHow could we get there? One thing that I realized when typing this up is that all we need is a few users who are willing to moderate the site in its early stages, and a bunch of people willing to ask questions. It might turn into a free for all early on, but the dust will settle, and the site can be recovered. Science Fiction and Fantasy is living proof of such a site, it was rocky at first, but now stands as a very solid site. All it took was a few people with the power and interest to set the site on the right course. \n\nAs for more of a list:\n\n1. I believe that a user should be required to have at least 200 reputation on at least one site prior to opening a proposal on Area 51\\. Maybe make a minimum 150 reputation or something like that.\n2. Have an option to commit to \"moderate\" a site. Have some criteria that shows how they are helping to moderate a site. This wouldn't require asking questions on the site, but maybe get points for closing, downvoting, and participating on meta, in addition to closing questions, to get the commitment back."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the documentation, which of the following is NOT listed as one of the factors that makes a Stack Exchange site successful?\n\nA) A clearly defined scope that can attract a reasonable number of users\nB) Finding a community of users already within Stack Exchange\nC) Having a large marketing budget to promote the site\nD) Maintaining interest in the site over time\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation does not mention having a large marketing budget as a factor for success.

When an op-amp's input signal exceeds its power supply rails, the output will be limited to a voltage between the power supply rails. This is due to the internal structure of the op-amp, particularly the output stage transistors, which can only pull the output to within a small voltage of either rail. The op-amp will not be damaged by this (ruling out option A), nor will it oscillate (ruling out B) or exceed its power supply limitations (ruling out D).

The final current (steady-state) through the circuit is 12V / (4k\u03a9 + 2k\u03a9) = 2 mA\n2. The initial current through the 4k\u03a9 resistor is 0 mA (switch was open)\n3.

The next version of the Android app will include a small reputation tracker widget, more info about that below, but before we get started on the more difficult widgets I wanted to get some extra feedback.\n\nWe've tossed around the ideas of three different widgets:\n\n1. Single\\-site reputation tracking.\n2. Inbox and Achievements, similar to the GMail inbox widget.\n3.

Would real\\-time updating make it more useful?\n\nRegarding the other widgets: Would you actually use them? It seems like the questions regarding widgets have very low vote counts so it doesn't a lot of sense to dedicate time to them if people aren't excited about them.

I don't really care about knowing my precise rep score each and every moment of my day. Furthermore, the number is essentially meaningless. Unless I'm expected to memorize my rep every 30 minutes, I have no idea what happened to make it go up or down.\n\nWhat would be a better idea is having a widget that shows things that actually *matter*, and that shows things that give you meaningful information at a glance.

Other minor details, that might be more of a cosmetical thing but should still be adjusted, is that you have a space before max\\-lease\\-time and that you lack a space between the subnetmask and {, also in Step 3\\.\n\nIf these pointers don't solve your problem, can you paste more of your syslog file to help us help you better?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When configuring a DHCP server on Ubuntu, a system administrator encounters issues during installation and startup. Which of the following is most likely to resolve the problem based on the information given?\n\nA) Changing \"INTERFACEs\" to \"INTERFACES\" in /etc/default/dhcp3-server\nB) Correcting \"dafault-lease-time\" to \"default-lease-time\" in /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf\nC) Adding a space between the subnet mask and the opening curly brace in the subnet declaration\nD) Increasing the default-lease-time value to 1200 seconds\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most critical issue in the provided configuration is the misspelling of \"default-lease-time\" as \"dafault-lease-time\" in the DHCP configuration file (/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf). This typo would cause the DHCP server to fail to start properly, resulting in the \"check syslog for diagnostics\" error message.\n\nWhile option A (correcting \"INTERFACEs\" to \"INTERFACES\") is also a valid correction, it's less likely to cause a complete failure of the DHCP server.\n\nOption C (adding a space between the subnet mask and curly brace) is a minor formatting issue that wouldn't cause the server to fail.\n\nOption D (increasing the lease time) is not related to the errors described and wouldn't resolve the startup issues.\n\nThe spelling error in the configuration file is the most severe issue that would prevent the DHCP server from starting correctly, making option B the most likely to resolve the problem."}}
