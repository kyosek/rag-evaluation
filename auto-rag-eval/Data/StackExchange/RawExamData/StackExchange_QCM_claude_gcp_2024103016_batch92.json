If so, your hardware isn't causing the problem.\n\n> **Why would I need a \"lock\" on an open directory?**\n\nDPKG/Apt locks `/var/lib/dpkg` to ensure that it can install software in peace, without causing any conflicts to the database of installed packages (present at `/var/lib/dpkg/status`). It's a safety mechanism to keep APT from blowing itself up by accident.\n\n> **How do I find what process is using it?**\n\nYou already have! Look at the output of: `sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock`:\n\n```\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME\naptitude 2166 root    3uW  REG  252,0        0 49021509 /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\n```\n\nThe program `aptitude` (a pretty package manager) is active, and is the current owner of the lock. \n\n> **How do I fix this? Could someone walk me thru the steps?**\n\nThere are a few things you can do. \n\nFirst off, you can just break the lock by running `sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock`. However, it's a good idea not to break this lock to force other `apt` processes to run, as you may be interrupting something important, which may leave your system in an unusable state. Only do this if you're 100% sure that `apt` or `dpkg` isn't running. You can check this by running `ps -aux | grep dpkg` or `ps -aux | grep apt`. If either of these return anything other than a line with `grep` in it, it's unsafe to break the lock.\n\nSecondly, you can go around to all of your terminals to see where `aptitude` is being run, and to check up on it. If you cannot find the terminal that it's on, the `w` command will help you a lot.\n\nThird, you can just kill the process by force, although this may still need you to break the lock. Do this by running `sudo kill <PID>`, where `<PID>` is the number in the `lsof` entry, in your case, `2166`. Do not run `kill -9` for apt, as it will forcefully kill it, while regular `kill` will give apt a chance to clean everything up before it dies. You can also kill the process by rebooting, logging off, or exiting the terminal it's running in.\n\nIf you do forcefully kill `apt` and break the lock, it's a very good idea to run `dpkg --configure -a` to let DPKG fix what was potentially broken."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're troubleshooting an issue where you can't install new software on your Linux system due to a lock on /var/lib/dpkg. After running \"sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock\", you see that aptitude is holding the lock. Which of the following is the SAFEST course of action to resolve this issue?\n\nA) Run \"sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\" to forcefully remove the lock file\nB) Use the \"kill -9\" command with the PID of aptitude to immediately terminate the process\nC) Locate the terminal where aptitude is running and check its status or complete its operation\nD) Reboot the system to clear all locks and processes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the safest course of action. Locating the terminal where aptitude is running allows you to check its status and potentially complete its operation normally. This avoids the risks associated with forcefully breaking locks or killing processes.\n\nOption A (removing the lock file) is risky as it may interrupt important processes and leave the system in an unusable state. \nOption B (using kill -9) is too forceful and doesn't allow aptitude to clean up properly. \nOption D (rebooting) will work but is unnecessarily disruptive when safer alternatives exist.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes the importance of not breaking the lock unless you're absolutely sure it's safe, and suggests checking running processes first. It also recommends using regular \"kill\" over \"kill -9\" if termination is necessary."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/14", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/88444", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/2530/"], "docs_id": 88444, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This sounds like something that must have been answered long ago, but for some reason I can find nothing on it in the internet. (There has been lots of recent activity in diagonal covariants, related to the $n!$ conjecture, but invariants seem to have become a stepchild in this process.)\n\nLet $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$.

Also, $R$ is a projection, and therefore the image of $R$ is a direct summand of of its domain of definition.\nIt follows therefore that the $k\\[X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n,Y\\_1,\\\\ldots,Y\\_n]^{S\\_n\\\\times S\\_n}$\\-module $ k\\[X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n,Y\\_1,\\\\ldots,Y\\_n]^{S\\_n}$ is a direct summand of the free $k\\[X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n,Y\\_1,\\\\ldots,Y\\_n]^{S\\_n\\\\times S\\_n}$\\-module $k\\[X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n,Y\\_1,\\\\ldots,Y\\_n]$.\n\nNow since the action of $S\\_n\\\\times S\\_n$ is generated by reflections, its invariant ring is a polynomial ring, and therefore any direct summand of a free module over this ring is again free (this is the Quillen\u2013Suslin theorem).\n\n---\n\nEdit (concerning the rank, which is $n!$): Let $G$ be a finite group acting on $R\\=k\\[x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n]$ and let $H\\\\leq G$ be a subgroup.

Following Zinn\\-Justin, they are the properties of these integrals under the following:\n\n1. Translations:\n\n$$\n\\\\int d^d p \\\\, F(p \\+ q) \\= \\\\int d^d p \\\\, F(p)\n$$\n\n2. Dilatations:\n\n$$\n\\\\int d^d p \\\\, F(\\\\lambda p) \\= \\|\\\\lambda\\|^{\\-d} \\\\int d^d p \\\\, F(p)\n$$\n\n3.

Dimensional regularization is a powerful technique for evaluating potentially divergent integrals, but its application and results depend on the specific parameters of the integral.\n\nA is incorrect because the convergence of the integral depends on the values of d and \u03b1. There are combinations where the integral diverges.\n\nB is not always correct. While setting d = 4 - \u03b5 is a common approach in dimensional regularization, it's not guaranteed to work for all integrals or yield meaningful results without additional considerations.\n\nC is incorrect. The translation invariance property doesn't imply that all integrals vanish. It's used to simplify certain integrals, but doesn't universally make them zero.\n\nD is correct because dimensional regularization allows us to evaluate this integral, but the result will indeed depend on d and \u03b1. For some values, the integral might converge directly. For others, we may need to use analytic continuation to define the integral for complex d, and then carefully take limits to extract physical results.

For example, $F\\_1$ is comprised of 100 actual features. Before training a logistic regression classifier, I re\\-weight the *individual* feature sets (re\\-scaled between 0 and 1\\) as follows:\n\n$$F\\_x \\= w\\_x \\* F\\_x,$$\n\ni.e., by multiplying each feature set with a weight between 0 and 1\\.\n\nMy question is the following:\n\nAssuming I get (for the aforementioned example) weights: $\\\\mathcal{W} \\= \\\\{w\\_1 \\= 0\\.2, w\\_2 \\= 0\\.9,w\\_3 \\= 0\\.000004\\\\}$ (the index corresponds to an individual feature set from $F$).\n\nCan I interpret this in the lines of: \"The second feature set (2\\) contributes the most to the learning\" etc.?\n\nWith other words: How sensitive is logistic regression to such changes in feature values.\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This depends on whether you are talking about logistic regression or penalized (e.g. LASSO, ridge or elastic net) logistic regression.\n\n* In standard logistic regression re\\-scaling features in any way doesn't really make any difference to the maximum likelihood estimate (obviously, coefficients will correspondingly end up being re\\-scaled), unless you multiply the feature by 0 (which just destroys all information). I.e. if before re\\-scaling the log\\-odds for an event increase by 0\\.5 for every year of age and you multiply age by 0\\.1, then the new coefficient will be 5 (i.e. for every 10 years of age the log\\-odds go up by 5\\). However, re\\-scaling coefficients can cause or fix numerical issues in fitting a logistic regression model.\n* In penalized logistic regression, re\\-scaling features matters, because (as explained above) the absolute size of the maximum likelihood estimates changes and so features that were re\\-scaled with small factors get penalized more and those re\\-scaled with large factors get penalized less. Here, \"penalized more\" means that the regression coefficients will be shrunk from the maximum likelihood estimate relatively more towards zero than for the coefficients for other features.\n* The second bullet is why, if one has no particular reason to favor some features over others, it is common to standardize (i.e. center on zero and fix SD to 1\\) features before applying penalized logistic regression. The kind of approach you describe can be applied thereafter to do something like expressing a prior belief about which coefficients are more likely to be truly further away from zero. If done without standardizing first, I'm not really sure why I would do it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working with a logistic regression model using three feature sets: F1, F2, and F3. Before training, they apply weights to each feature set: w1 = 0.2, w2 = 0.9, and w3 = 0.000004. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the impact of these weights on the model?\n\nA) The second feature set (F2) will contribute the most to the learning process in all cases.\n\nB) The weights will have no effect on a standard logistic regression model's maximum likelihood estimate, but will impact penalized logistic regression.\n\nC) The third feature set (F3) will be effectively removed from the model due to its very low weight.\n\nD) The first feature set (F1) will be penalized more heavily than the others in a penalized logistic regression model.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In standard logistic regression, rescaling features (which is effectively what these weights do) doesn't change the maximum likelihood estimate, except for adjusting the coefficients proportionally. However, in penalized logistic regression (such as LASSO, ridge, or elastic net), these weights would matter significantly. They would affect how much each feature set is penalized, with smaller weights leading to more penalization.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while F2 has the largest weight, this doesn't necessarily mean it will contribute the most to learning in all cases, especially in standard logistic regression.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because even with a very small weight, F3 isn't removed from the model. In standard logistic regression, it would still contribute, just with rescaled coefficients.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because in penalized logistic regression, features with smaller weights (like F3) would actually be penalized more heavily, not those with larger weights like F1.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how feature scaling affects different types of logistic regression models, a nuanced topic in machine learning."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/11/09", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/43276", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/15929/"], "docs_id": 43276, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My product page template seems to be showing all photos linked to a product, even if they have the \"Exclude\" option set.

As soon as I connect the wires to the transfomer that run to the chime the voltage drops to 2V or so. What would that indicate? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming you have a full mains voltage going *into* the transformer, then there is a short\\-circuit in the wiring (or, much less likely, the transformer is vastly underrated for the current drawn).\n\n\"Bell wire\" has thin insulation, compared to mains wiring. A staple may be pinching the wires, or wires could have rubbed together, tearing the insulation. Sometimes mice or squirrels can cause this. Such a short could have burned out the old transformer.\n\nAnother possibility is a short in the chime, which then caused the contacts of the doorbell switch to fuse together.\n\nAlso, inspect your connections to the transformer. If there are multiple wires, e.g. from both a front and a back door switch, they could be misconnected.\n\nIf you can, check the resistance between the bell wires going to the transformer secondary. The resistance should be greater than 16 divided by the current rating of the transformer, or (16 x 16\\) divided by the VA rating. For example, if the transformer is rated 10 VA, then circuit resistance should be greater than 256/10, or \\~26 ohms. (Not to worry if it's just a bit lower, though: you're measuring DC resistance, while AC reactance across a coil is higher.)\n\nDon't be concerned about the 22 VAC *open circuit* output because the *nominal* voltage, 16 VAC, is at the rated load.\n\nBTW, my compliments on checking the voltage on installation!

However, the significant voltage drop to 2V when connected suggests a short circuit in the wiring or chime. This is the most common issue in such scenarios. The correct approach is to inspect the bell wire for damage (e.g., pinched by staples, worn insulation, rodent damage) and check the resistance of the circuit. If the resistance is lower than expected based on the transformer's rating, it confirms a short circuit. This approach addresses the root cause and prevents potential fire hazards or repeated transformer burnouts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the high no-load voltage is normal and not indicative of a faulty transformer.

The server runs Lighttpd, several FastCGI PHP processes, and a MySQL database. After investigation, the admin finds four PHP processes in state 'D' (uninterruptible sleep). What is the most likely cause of this issue and how should the admin proceed to resolve it?\n\nA) The PHP processes are experiencing memory leaks. The admin should increase the server's RAM.\nB) The server is under a DDoS attack. The admin should implement stricter firewall rules.\nC) The PHP processes are stuck waiting for disk I/O. The admin should investigate potential disk or filesystem issues.\nD) The MySQL database is causing lock contention. The admin should optimize database queries and indexes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key information in the scenario is that the PHP processes are in state 'D', which indicates uninterruptible sleep. This state typically occurs when a process is waiting for I/O operations, most commonly disk I/O. The steadily increasing load without full CPU utilization also points to an I/O bottleneck rather than a CPU-bound problem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because memory leaks would typically result in increasing memory usage, not necessarily increased load or processes in state 'D'.\n\nOption B is unlikely as a DDoS attack would usually cause more immediate and severe symptoms, not a gradual increase in load over weeks.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately identifies the symptom (processes in state 'D') and suggests the most likely cause (disk I/O issues).\n\nOption D, while possible, is less likely given the specific symptoms described. Database lock contention would typically manifest differently and would not necessarily cause PHP processes to enter uninterruptible sleep states.\n\nThe admin should proceed by investigating potential disk or filesystem issues, such as checking disk health, examining I/O wait times, and looking for any problematic disk access patterns in the PHP applications."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/13", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/559968", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/282831/"], "docs_id": 559968, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm new to this and i'm doing my first real build for a friend.

Look up some power transistors. Also a Schottky diode.\n\nAs for the circuit to allow charging and powering up the circuit at the same time, here's a simplistic sketch:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAGum.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAGum.jpg)\n\nWhen you have 12V at the input, the battery charger will charge the battery, and the PMOS will not allow current to flow from the battery to the circuit, so the amplifier will be powered by the 12V directly. When you disconnect the voltage from the 12V input, the current will flow through the transistor's inner diode.\n\nThis allows you to power your amplifier and charge the battery at the same time when you connect the 12V at a single input."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio enthusiast is building a portable amplifier system with battery power and charging capabilities.

The PMOS transistor and Schottky diode configuration allows:\n\n1. Automatic switching between external power and battery power\n2. Charging the battery while powering the amp from the external supply\n3. Prevention of current flow from the battery when external power is connected\n\nOption A doesn't allow simultaneous charging and operation. Option C could potentially cause issues with uncontrolled current flow between the battery and power supply. Option D requires manual intervention and doesn't allow simultaneous charging and operation.\n\nThe PMOS transistor acts as a switch, preventing current flow from the battery when external power is present, while the Schottky diode allows current to flow from the battery to the amp when external power is disconnected.

I just want to outsource decision\\-making and not solely rely on a single person.\n\nI also think heavily posting users here should go through a disclaimer process to prove they are responding for public benefit and not their commercial interests, is there a way to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Blame all those glorified toasters for the fact your service is *already* oversubscribed\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe source of your load calculation problem, quite bluntly, is the 19kW of electric resistance heat fitted to your house. Without it, our load calculation looks like the following:\n\n* 1250 ft\u00b2 \\* 3VA/ft\u00b2 \\= 3750VA of general lighting/receptacle load from NEC 220\\.12/220\\.14(J), and\n* 3 small appliance branch circuits (2 kitchen countertop, 1 laundry) give us 4500VA of SABC load from NEC 220\\.52(A)/(B)\n\nwhich gives us 4838VA of factored general load (using the 35% demand factor for general \\+ SABC loads over 3kVA, as per).\n\nThen, atop that 4838VA of factored general load, we add our heavy appliances:\n\n* 8kVA for a range under 12kVA as per Table 220\\.55 Column C for a single range (let us know if your range is bigger than that)\n* 4\\.5kVA for the water heater, and\n* 5kVA for the dryer as per NEC 220\\.54\n\nwhich gives us a reasonable 22338VA, or 93A @ 240VAC, for your house *before* we add the electric resistance heat. However, that 60\\+kBTU/hr of resistance heat, by itself, takes up 3800VA \\* 5 heaters \\* 1\\.25 due to continuous load factoring (NEC 424\\.3(B)). This adds up to 23\\.75kVA of load, or another 99A at 240VAC; atop that, it's also a NEC violation *right now* as NEC 230\\.23(A) requires services to be large enough to handle their Article 220 calculated loads:\n\n> **230\\.23 Size and Rating.**\n> \n> \n> **(A) General.** Conductors shall have sufficient ampacity to\n> carry the current for the load as calculated in accordance with\n> Article 220 and shall have adequate mechanical strength.\n\nThe answer to the question you should be asking, but haven't yet, is a *heat pump*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, those space heaters just won't cut it for keeping the whole house warm, especially during a cold snap where at\\-risk piping can easily freeze up and make a mess. As a result of that, homeowners insurers require working central heating systems, and so do the building codes, for that matter. In the IRC, this requirement is found in R303\\.10 (the Table R301\\.2 reference is really a reference to the 99% temperature from the ACCA Manual J tables):\n\n> **R303\\.10 Required heating.**\n> \n> \n> Where the winter design temperature in Table R301\\.2 is below 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), every *dwelling unit* shall be provided with heating facilities capable of maintaining a room temperature of not less than 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) at a point 3 feet (914mm) above the floor and 2 feet (610mm) from exterior walls in habitable rooms at the design temperature. The installation of one or more portable space heaters shall not be used to acheive compliance with this section.\n\nThe question then is \"how can you heat your house without consuming most of your service?\" Fortunately, heat pump technology has made leaps and bounds since the early days; today's *mini\\-split* heat pumps can defrost without strip heat and have efficiency ratings that put most of the air conditioners you're used to seeing to shame. Furthermore, you can get them in capacities up to 5 tons (60kBTU) nowadays, with either a single large indoor unit similar to a conventional air handler feeding a full duct system, or multiple smaller indoor units that either feed flat \"pancake\" ducts or serve single rooms/areas.\n\nSo, given that your manual J design temperatures are around 40\u00b0F, I'd get someone qualified to run an ACCA Manual J, Eighth Edition calculation on your house, and then have them use Manual S to size a new heat pump from there. This will let you decommission all those costly resistance heaters and enjoy *both* efficient, reliable heat in the winter *and* air conditioning in the summer. And when I say efficient, I mean *more than twice as efficient* as your resistance heat; using a LG LMU600HV as an example, it consumes a mere 32\\.2A @ 230VAC, or just over 9\\.25kVA of load. Keep in mind that this is essentially a *worst case* figure; real\\-world numbers will be better than this, especially if you can leverage some envelope upgrades (insulation, air\\-sealing) to knock your heating load down further.\n\nBut, those car charger plans *also* call for a service upgrade\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile replacing the resistance heaters with a heat pump gets you back within the realm of what your existing 125A service can handle, adding that 40A or 50A car charger load (really, 32A or 40A times 1\\.25\\) to the picture is enough to put you well over 125A of service ampacity. So, in order to cover that, you'll need to have a service upgrade done *anyway*; the good news is that getting rid of those glorified toasters lets you upgrade to a relatively inexpensive 200A service instead of forcing you into much costlier Class 320 service hardware.\n\nWhen you're having the electrician put the service upgrade in, make sure that you get plenty of *panel spaces*; while the extra kitchen branch circuits don't add much load, they do take up a fair few spaces, and nobody *ever* complains about having too much room in their panel! In fact, I'd go with a 40\\-space or 42\\-space panel as a *minimum* specification for this service upgrade; if you can get a 54\\-space or 60\\-space panel, or a pair of 40\\-space or 42\\-space panels either fed in parallel from a meter\\-main or daisy\\-chained together, that's even better."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is upgrading the electrical system of a 1250 sq ft townhouse.

(duh on my part) So I want to use 110V across the 220V primary leads to give me half the voltage at each secondary, resulting in a single secondary of 32V and a center tap.\n\nI know that this works because I have done it and observed that the output is 32V RMS with a center tap, but I want to make sure I'm not throwing away half the VA rating by doing so. I read TONS about transformers trying to get a definitive answer to this, and I think that the core saturation and the secondary wire size and associated voltage drop and heat are the main concerns, along with the fact that the ratio of number of turns is proportional to the ratio of the voltages and inversely proportional to the ratio of the currents in the primary and secondary. So on those points, I think I'm not reducing the usable 200VA, with the possible exception of secondary wire heating.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean using the image below, I would wire\\-nut the middle black and red primary wires together and connect 110V across the top red and bottom black wires. And on the secondary, I would connect the middle blue and green wires and use that connection as my center tap. I would use the top green and the bottom blue wires as my supply rails and there would be 32V RMS across these rails. If that's confusing for me to say rails, I'll add that I'm using a bridge rectifier and 2 shunt capacitors to make them into \\+/\\- 45\\-ish volt rails for an amplifier.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qP1Bl.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qP1Bl.png)\n\nYes, I know that this is NOT standard, and this is not for a commercial product, so please don't reply simply that this is not standard or that it will void my warranty.\n\nThere is a similar question [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/235359/using-220v-transformer-on-110v-input) with 2 answers to my question, but unfortunately those two answers contradict each other exactly. Also, [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/413977/connecting-the-primaries-of-two-110v-transformers-in-series-across-220v) is a question with a very promising title, but the answers don't answer my question. The other similar questions don't have answers which address the current\\-rating\\-doubling part.\n\nPlease weigh in if you know whether I can safely get the full 200VA in this way.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You will halve the rated VA of the transformer if you run it at half the rated input voltage.\n\nThe rated maximum VA is the product of maximum allowable Volts and maximum allowable Amps. The Amps will be unchanged, that's limited by wire heating. You've halved the Volts, so you've halved the VA, to first order at least. Running the core at half the field reduces the core losses, so the thermal load on the transformer is not quite so high. This means you can increase the thermal loading on the copper a little, at the expense of voltage drop aka voltage regulation. Maybe then the rated VA has only fallen to 55% and not to 50% of what it was.\n\nIf you have a centre\\-tapped 32 V, ie 16\\-0\\-16, you can bridge rectify that to about \\+/\\- 22 V. If you want \\+/\\- 45 V (that is, a total of 90 V from positive to negative, with ground in the middle), then the simplest way to get there is with a centre\\-tapped 64 V secondary (two 32 V secondaries in series), leaving your transformer configured and supplied as it sounds like it was meant to be, and like my audio amp transformer is.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Vyrj.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f8Vyrj.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio amplifier designer has a 200VA, 220V primary/32V secondary transformer without a center tap.

Using the transformer as designed with its full 220V primary input and connecting the two 32V secondaries in series will create a 64V center-tapped secondary.

On the left side in yellow, the wire has a very low resistance, that we will consider to be zero. But on the right hand side in green, the resistance is much higher, for example 10,000 ohms per meter. There is a current of 0\\.1 A, so in this example the voltage across the resistive part of the wire is 1000 V per meter of wire. The $E$\\-field inside the resistive part of the wire is therefore 1000 V/m.\n\nNo let's do some textbook application of Gauss Law, which states that the surface integral of the electric field, over any closed surface, is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity constant. On the left, inside the zero\\-resistance wire, the electric field in the wire is of course zero, because the resistance of the wire is zero, so there is no voltage drop along the wire. As sketched, we take a cylindrical Gaussian surface, just inside the surface of the wire. The electric field is zero everywhere on the Gaussian surface, so the surface integral is zero, and thus there is no enclosed charge. Yes. Everything ship\\-shape here, noting the well\\-known fact that there is zero net charge inside of a conductor, and that any excess charge resides on the surface, just outside of our Gaussian surface.\n\nNow consider a similar cylindrical Gaussian surface on the right, inside the green resistive wire. The electric field inside the wire here has the value $E$, in this case 1000 V/m. So the product of the electric field and the area is (AE) on each end of the cylinder. However, the electric flux is entering on one end, and leaving at the other end, so the sum of the flux is still zero, telling us there is zero enclosed charge. Gauss wins again.\n\nNow consider the Gaussian cylindrical surface in the center. On the LH end of the cylinder, the flux is zero, because the electric field here is zero. But on the RH end the flux is (EA), the non\\-zero electric field strength of 1000 V/m, multiplied by the cross sectional area of the wire. Hmmm. This tells us that there must be charge enclosed inside the wire, inside of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. But it is well know and accepted that there is no charge inside of a conductor, and so we have an apparent paradox, a violation of the Gauss Law.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I know what is happening, but it is such a cute problem that I would not wish to deprive others the opportunity to think about it.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtqHU.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtqHU.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can see, there is nothing wrong here: Since the properties of the material change where the green and the yellow parts meet, you do not have a single conductor but two different ones with a boundary between them. Gauss's law correctly states that there will be a surface charge on that boundary, which is responsible for the discontinuity of the electric field. In particular, as aekmr and J.G. explain in the comments, in a plane where a discontinuous change in the conductivity $\\\\sigma(\\\\vec r)$ occurs and through which the (homogeneous) current density $\\\\vec j$ flows, the electric field will change (also discontinouosly) so that $\\\\sigma(\\\\vec r) \\\\vec E(\\\\vec r) \\= \\\\vec j$ remains constant for all $\\\\vec r$.\n\n**Remark:**\n\nThe formula $\\\\sigma \\\\vec E \\= \\\\vec j$ is simply Ohm's law, formulated locally.

At the boundary between the low-resistance yellow section and the high-resistance green section, there is a change in conductivity. This results in a surface charge at this boundary, which is responsible for the discontinuity in the electric field. This surface charge is necessary to maintain the continuity of current (j = \u03c3E) across the boundary where \u03c3 changes abruptly. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while there is no net charge inside a uniform conductor, the boundary between different conductivities creates a special case. \n\nOption B is wrong as charge is not uniformly distributed throughout the wire; it accumulates at the boundary. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the electric field is not constant throughout both sections.

C/20 is the discharge rate over a 20 hour period and is typically how the \"305 Ah\" is rated in the first place (you get more Ah capacity discharging slower and less discharging faster \\- and the Ah tends to drop from rated capacity as the system ages.)\n\nA good \"rule of thumb\" on (lead/acid) battery bank size to support a certain draw is to stick at or below the C/20 rate. If your inverter supports multiple input voltages, I would strongly suggest going to a higher voltage (24, 36 or 48V) since maintaining a battery bank charged in parallel is much more prone to problems than a series string. \n\nOr, get a different vacuum, or a non\\-electric sweeper. You don't provide details about your vacuum cleaner, but many are quite high Amperage draw at 120V (or 240V), which will be more than 10 times (or 20 times) as much draw at 12V (inverters are not 100% efficient.)

The customizations made to the Budgie Desktop Environment will be preserved through the upgrade process, as the DE's configuration is separate from the core system upgrade."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/22", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2615621", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/521015/"], "docs_id": 2615621, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know how to calculate $\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}{x\\\\cot(x)dx}$\n\nBut when it adds $(x\\-\\\\pi)$, I don't know how to do.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Integration by parts tells that\n\n$$\n\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} x(x\\-\\\\pi)\\\\cot x \\\\, dx\n\\= \\\\underbrace{\\\\left\\[ x(x\\-\\\\pi) \\\\log\\\\sin x \\\\right]\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}}\\_{\\=0} \\- \\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} (2x\\-\\\\pi) \\\\log\\\\sin x \\\\, dx.\n$$\n\nNow notice that\n\n$$ \\-\\\\log\\\\sin x \\= \\-\\\\log\\\\left\\| \\\\frac{1 \\- e^{2ix}}{2}\\\\right\\| \\= \\\\log 2 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\cos (2nx)}{n} $$\n\nSo we have\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} x(x\\-\\\\pi)\\\\cot x \\\\, dx\n\\&\\= \\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} (2x\\-\\\\pi) \\\\left( \\\\log 2 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\cos (2nx)}{n} \\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{4}\\\\log 2 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(\\-1\\)^n \\- 1}{2n^3} \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{4}\\\\log 2 \\- \\\\frac{7}{8}\\\\zeta(3\\).\n\\\\end{align\\*}"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} x(x-\\pi)\\cot x \\, dx$.
