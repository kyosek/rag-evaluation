When a CM collected stats for us in 2014, [2\\.1% of our posts had *more than 50 comments*](https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2780/325). That's absurd, and the problem has continued. Moderators spend way too much time dealing with comments and flags on comments and complaints on meta about deleted comments and sniping about comments in *other* comments... for a second\\-class feature, comments sure do cause a lot of work. We haven't been able to [bring about a cultural change](https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/964/83) yet; can we add some friction?\n\nThe answer isn't to *prevent* comments because, while some people love to use comments for tangents, arguments, jokes, and long\\-winded discussions, comments *do* still serve a purpose. We *also* get the good kind, the ones that seek clarification or otherwise try to improve a post. And that's why we don't just purge threads wholesale; we need to preserve those ones if they're not yet obsolete. We want the good comments; we just want fewer of the others.\n\nInstead of cleaning up the problems afterward, it would be great if we had some way to *impede some of those comment explosions in the first place*, on sites where this is a problem. How can we do that? I can think of a few possibilities:\n\n1. Lower the number of comments needed before you get the \"let's continue this in chat\" suggestion. This currently happens if two users have posted three comments each, so there's not a lot of room to improve this. I see two downsides: (a) people can ignore that prompt (unless we change that), and (b) this does nothing for threads involving several people.\n2. Have something like protection that restricts commenting. This would allow moderators (or the community, preferably) to prevent drive\\-by comments on posts that are getting a lot of activity. Like protection, it should require a certain amount of reputation *on this site* to be able to comment. This helps with Hot Network Questions but might not make much of a dent otherwise.\n3. When comment rate reaches a certain threshold (N comments/hour), temporarily prevent further comments (for some number of hours) \\-\\- maybe from everybody, or maybe just from people who've commented more than M times already. The idea of rate\\-sensitive commenting limits is attractive, but I'm unsure about how it should work.\n\nWould any of these work? What else could be done to address this problem? (I now see that I made a couple more [quasi\\-suggestions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/260701/162102) elsewhere a while back.)\n\nThis question arises from one site, but I've seen comment explosions that could benefit from some throttling on other sites too, so it's not *only* one site's problem. I'm looking for something that sites could opt into, not something that would be mandatory across all of SE.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An idea that combines \\#1 and \\#3 (since you asked for further suggestions): limit each person to 3 (or perhaps 2\\) undeleted comments on a post at any time, except for the poster. That cuts off long discussion threads in their early stages, without much limiting the ability to request clarifications or suggest improvements: when the poster responds to your comment, you can delete it, which frees up a \"slot\" for you to make another suggestion.\n\nThis doesn't solve the whole problem, of course; there are still cases where a whole lot of people contribute to a discussion and you get 15 or 20 comments without more than 3 being from any one person. The door is still open for some other measure to address that case. It is also possible that two people can keep a rotating buffer of the last 4 or 6 messages of their ongoing discussion, but at that point it just seems silly not to move to chat, and honestly, if they're deleting their comments as they go is it really *that* bad?\n\n---\n\nPersonally, I would also be in favor of automatically deleting (almost) all comments after a week, but I think it's been established that I'm in the minority there."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A popular Q&A site is experiencing a persistent issue with excessive commenting on posts, leading to moderator burnout and community friction. The site administrators want to implement a solution that balances the need for constructive comments with the desire to reduce unproductive discussions. Which of the following approaches is most likely to effectively address this issue while preserving valuable interactions?\n\nA) Implement a system that automatically deletes all comments after one week to regularly clean up discussions\nB) Limit each user to a maximum of 3 undeleted comments per post, excluding the original poster\nC) Reduce the threshold for triggering the \"move to chat\" suggestion to 2 comments per user\nD) Institute a reputation-based protection system that restricts commenting abilities for new users\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most effective solution because it addresses several key aspects of the problem while aligning with the goals outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. It targets the root cause of \"comment explosions\" by limiting the number of comments per user, which directly addresses the issue of long-standing discussions and arguments.\n\n2. It preserves the ability for users to seek clarification and suggest improvements, which are identified as valuable uses of comments.\n\n3. It allows for a natural rotation of comments as users delete old ones to make new ones, encouraging more focused and relevant interactions.\n\n4. It doesn't completely prevent commenting (unlike option A), which could hinder legitimate uses of the feature.\n\n5. It's more effective than option C, which only suggests moving to chat and can be ignored.\n\n6. It's more universally applicable than option D, which primarily addresses issues with new users and hot network questions but doesn't solve the problem of excessive commenting by established users.\n\nThis solution combines elements of suggestions 1 and 3 from the documentation, creating a balanced approach that adds friction to lengthy comment threads while still allowing for necessary communication.

This choice is correct because:\n\n1. tf.nn.conv2d() is the core, low-level convolution functionality in TensorFlow, providing the most direct control over the convolution operation.\n2.

The remaining fields are left in their original order.\n\nInstead of the `put` expression using `sub()`, you may use `put` with its `splitnv()` function to split the `FIRSTNAME` field's value on spaces and pick out the 1st generated string:\n\n```bash\nmlr --csv \\\n    put '$FIRSTNAME = splitnv($FULLNAME,\" \")[1]' then \\\n    reorder -f COMPANY,FULLNAME,FIRSTNAME file\n\n```\n\n---\n\nFor prettier output:\n\n```bash\n$ mlr --icsv --opprint --barred put '$FIRSTNAME = splitnv($FULLNAME,\" \")[1]' then reorder -f COMPANY,FULLNAME,FIRSTNAME file\n+--------------+---------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------------+----------+-------------+----------------------+\n| COMPANY      | FULLNAME                        | FIRSTNAME | EMAIL                          | FUNCTION          | CITY     | INDUSTRY    | COMMENT              |\n+--------------+---------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------------+----------+-------------+----------------------+\n| Company name | Firstname Lastname              | Firstname | firstname.lastname@example.com | Marketing Manager | New York | Health Care | home, work           |\n| Company name | Firstname infix Lastname        | Firstname | firstname.lastname@example.com | Marketing Manager | New York | Health Care | home, workhome, work |\n| Company name | Firstname infix infix2 Lastname | Firstname | firstname.lastname@example.com | Marketing Manager | New York | Health Care | home, work           |\n+--------------+---------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------------+----------+-------------+----------------------+\n\n```"}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data analyst is tasked with processing multiple CSV files containing customer information. They need to add a new column 'FIRSTNAME' next to the existing 'FULLNAME' column, extracting the first name from the full name. Which of the following approaches would be the most robust and efficient for handling this task, especially considering potential complexities in the data?\n\nA) Use a simple awk command to split the FULLNAME field on spaces and take the first element\nB) Implement a custom Python script to read and process each CSV file individually\nC) Utilize the Miller (mlr) utility with a combination of 'put' and 'reorder' commands\nD) Apply a sed command to insert the new column and extract the first word of FULLNAME\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Miller (mlr) utility is the most robust and efficient approach for this task. It offers several advantages:\n\n1. CSV-aware: Miller is designed to work with CSV files, handling potential complexities like commas within fields (as seen in the COMMENT column).\n\n2. Flexibility: The 'put' command allows for sophisticated data manipulation. The provided solution uses 'splitnv($FULLNAME,\" \")[1]', which correctly extracts the first name even in cases with multiple words or infixes in the full name.\n\n3. Reordering capability: The 'reorder' command ensures the new FIRSTNAME column is placed immediately after FULLNAME, maintaining the desired structure.\n\n4. Efficiency: Miller is optimized for processing large datasets and multiple files.\n\n5. Handling edge cases: Unlike simple awk or sed solutions, Miller can better handle potential edge cases in the data.\n\n6. Readability and maintainability: The Miller command is concise yet clear, making it easier for other team members to understand and modify if needed.\n\nWhile options A and D (awk and sed) could work for simple cases, they may struggle with complexities in the data and lack the robustness of Miller. Option B (custom Python script) could be flexible but would require more development time and may not be as efficient for processing multiple large files compared to a specialized tool like Miller."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/23", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/82832", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/15770/"], "docs_id": 82832, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My understanding is that drywall tape is to [provide structure to the mud as the framing members shift](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/8281/what-is-the-purpose-of-tape-when-taping-and-mudding-drywall).

If you don't center them perfectly, leaving uniform gaps, the joint compound has nowhere to go in the tight spots and you're left with a paper\\-thin skin on the surface that's sure to crack.\n2. How well you press mud into the gap. Same reason.\n3. Your climate. Extremes of temperature and humidity will probably crack untaped joints.\n4. How you use the lath. If you use just one the plugs can move more and will probably crack. If you use two, well spaced, and 8 screws, probably not.\n\nWhat I'd do:\n\nSince it's only 17 plugs, run a strip of tape down one side, and a strip down the other, covering as much joint as possible with the two. The remaining untaped joint segments will be short enough that they're not likely to crack. This will take very little time.

And see if that cuts down on your login connections. If not than I would suggest going the more extreme route and configuring fail2ban. But again be very careful and thoroughly read through the setup documentation.\n\n---\n\nI would create a second `sshd` service running on another port number and leave it there until you begin to experience the login issue. Then the next time the issue occurs, I would try connecting to that other `sshd` and see if you can find more information out about your issue.\n\nCreate debugging sshd on port `6022` (you need to do this because the original sshd is already running on port 22\\).\n\n```\n# nohup /usr/sbin/sshd -p 6022 -ddd > ~/sshd.log 2>&1 &\n\n```\n\n* **nohup**: run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non\\-tty\n* **\\-p**: set port number (in this case 6022\\)\n* **\\> \\~/sshd.log 2\\>\\&1**: redirect stdout and stderr to \\~/sshd.log\n* **\\&**: If a command is terminated by the control operator \\&, the shell executes the command in the background in\na subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0\\.\n\nThis new sshd will only accept one connection and will terminate after that connection has succeed. \n\n```\n# ssh -vvv -p 6022 user@remotehostname\n[OR]\n# ssh -vvv -p 6022 user@remoteIPaddress\n\n```\n\nThe next time you hang you can see if:\n\n1. Was it just the sshd running on port 22 that was the problem? Did 6022 succeed?\n2. If 22 and 6022 both hang, then you can compare the logs from the \\-ddd server output and the client's \\-vvv output to see if you can uncover more information about the issue.\n\n---\n\nAnother thing you can check is MTU, I have experienced something similar before when there was a miss\\-match in MTU size between the server and the client.

The error message \"Reboot and Select proper device or Insert Boot Media in Selected Boot device\" indicates that the VM cannot find a bootable device, suggesting the ISO lacks the necessary boot sector information.\n\nCreating an ISO from a folder of installation files doesn't typically result in a bootable image, as it lacks the boot sector and structure required for the VM to recognize it as a valid boot device. This explains why the VM fails to boot even when the ISO is \"captured\" or mounted.\n\nTo resolve this, the developer should obtain a proper bootable ISO image of Windows 2003, either by creating one directly from the original installation CD using appropriate imaging software that preserves boot information, or by obtaining a pre-made bootable ISO from a legitimate source.\n\nOptions A and B are less likely, as a corrupt ISO would typically result in different errors, and the boot order is usually set correctly by default in VMs. Option D is incorrect because MS Virtual PC 2007 is compatible with Windows Vista, and the issue is clearly related to the boot media, not the virtualization platform itself.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given scenario, integration of concepts related to virtualization, bootable media, and ISO creation, and application of troubleshooting skills in a real-world context."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/29", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/73018", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/14211/"], "docs_id": 73018, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does this sentence mean? \n\n> What was over there?  \n> \n>  Freaky pink primates!\n\nWhy 'pink' ?

It doesn't means that its right at all. I can tell you what was hard for me, and what wasn't hard.\n\n1. Magento has no normal documentation.\n2. As written above. Best community is stackexchange.\n3. For many people english isn't native language. And understand some articles is not very easy sometimes. Even when author start use different idioms or not common words.\n4. If you don't use xDebug forget about low lvl magento development.\n5. Even if you are good developer you need rich experience in magento to achieve something not common.\n\nMy advice how to improve your magento experience \\- is to read Certification Preparation Guide. Resolve tasks which are offered. \n\nHere are some of them (randomly):\n\nQ: Describe how Magento determines which controller to use and how to customize route\\-to\\-controller resolution\n\nTask: Create your own FRONT controller\n\nQ: Configure a database connection\n\nQ: Describe how to implement advanced Adminhtml Grids and Forms, including\neditable cells, mass actions, totals, reports, custom filters and renderers, multiple grids on one page, combining grids with forms, and adding custom javascript to an admin form\n\nIn this preparation document most probably you find answer on your second question.

In my experience it has been anywhere between a couple days and a couple weeks (too many variables to count), and this is of course assuming that your app isn't rejected for any reason.\n\nHowever there is a work around for timing the release of your app just right. Make sure you submit it to Apple **WELL** in advance, and during the iTunes Connect new app creation process you will at some point be asked if you would like the app to automatically be released when it is approved, or if you would like to manually release it yourself. Go with the latter and you will at any point be able approve your app and it will be up on the App Store within a couple of hours.\n\nIf you have already selected automatic release and wish to change it, you can do this at any time in iTunes Connect by navigating to your app, selecting \"Rights and Pricing\" and adjusting your applications availability dates."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about submitting an iOS app to Apple, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A developer is planning to release an iOS app for a 4-day sports event.

Option B is the best choice because:\n\n1. It addresses the variable review time mentioned in the answer (\"anywhere between a couple days and a couple weeks\").\n2. It utilizes the manual release option, which allows the developer to control the exact release timing.\n3.

Currently I am working on a mapping software which allows to visualize these points in maps. The current software version orthographically projects the points onto a plane, but future versions should support a wider range of map projections like Mercator and others. (It is not yet decided which exactly but the software design should be open to extension.)\n\nFrom what I have read so far, the usual process for creating maps is\n\n* project the 3D points onto the chosen reference ellipsoid which yields (2D) LatLong coordinates (in case of WGS84 ellipsoid, I could use my current LatLong and \"drop\" the altitude information)\n* transform the LatLong coordinates into map coordinates (depending on the chosen map projection)\n\nThis actually is different from what we are doing currently: By first projecting onto the reference ellipsoid, the altitude is \"lost\". If then the projected point is transformed (e.g. with an orthographic projection) to map coordinates, altitude has no effect. In contrast, if the 3d point is directly projected orthographically, \"altitude\" (wrt to any ellipsoid) has effect on the output coordinates.\n\nI tried to illustrate this (based on the height definition in @Farid Cher's answer):\n\n[![1-step vs 2-step projection](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eim0h.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eim0h.png)\nWhen Point P0 is directly projected (as in our case) it becomes P0p on the Projection plane, whereas by first projecting onto the ellipsoid (to P1\\) and then projecting on the Projection plane, it becomes P1p (which is not P0p).\n\nMy questions are these:\n\n1\\.) Is there any (practically relevant) map projection which follows the approach that we have currently implemented or do they \"all\" adhere to the two step process described earlier? (I.e., does the Altitude have an influence on the map coordinates?)\n\n2\\.) Is it safe to assume that all points with the same LatLong coordinates (wrt any practically used reference ellipsoid) are on a straight line? (I know that depending on the choice of geodetic or geocentric coordinates, these lines for different LatLong may have a common point or not, but that's not too important for me.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To address your second question, I can say, that depends on how you project earth topography on your ellipsoid (how the straight line is defined). The straight line can be rhumb\\-line, a line vertical to the ellipsoid surface or a line that passes through the ellipsoid center. If you define this line, then you can say any LatLong on this line are equal.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCDKc.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCDKc.jpg)\n\nSo any point (LatLong) on earth surface has an equivalent point on the ellipsoid (e.g. wgs84\\). It is not like simply dropping the z (altitude) from 3D coordinate. This is usually the intersection of rhumb\\-line with the mathematical ellipsoid surface. \n [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/plSBz.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/plSBz.gif)\nWhen you transform a geographic coordinate system (WGS84\\) to a projected coordinate system, It doesn't mean you are losing (dropping) the Z (earth topography). The LatLong already contains the altitude implicitly (intersection of rumb\\-line with ellipsoid). \n\nSo to answer your first question, all map projections are doing the same process like your orthographic projection. But you should know how the ellipsoid X,Y (Phi,Lambda) are inferred from the location on earth surface. There are many ellipsoids or spheroids that estimate the earth surface. Each of them has a well defined mapping, from the earth topography on the mathematical earth surface (ellipsoid or spheroid). \n\nI reccommend you to read esri online documentation about map projections:\n[Projection basics the GIS professional needs to know](http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=projection_basics_the_gis_professional_needs_to_know)\n\n**Update**\n\nIn your example you are trying to project a simple 3D point (X,Y,Z) to a 2D space (not a map projection). \n\nWhy do we use map projections at all?\nWith map projection we want to reach the 2D space from ellipsoidal (spherical) surface of the earth. It seems more complex than your simple projection. So we use approximation. For example with the popular TM (Transfer Mercator) projection, We fit a cylindrical shape to earth surface that the cylinder is longitudinal along the equator. Although with this specific projection, it may result in extreme stretching near poles.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lozoN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lozoN.png)\n\nImagine you are projecting each point on estimated earth e.g. ellipsoid (LatLong) to this cylinder (This part is like your process of orthogonal projection). visualize you have cut the earth to equal slices; Then open the sliced earth to cover the cylinder.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujUTa.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujUTa.jpg)\n\nThen suppose this cylinder is a paper and you cut the paper vertically. Now you have a 2D surface that contains all points from the complex 3D earth surface."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A GIS developer is designing a new mapping software that needs to support multiple map projections. The software currently uses direct orthographic projection of 3D ECEF coordinates onto a plane. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for implementing a flexible system that supports various map projections while maintaining consistency with standard cartographic practices?\n\nA) Continue using direct orthographic projection of 3D coordinates for all map types, as it preserves altitude information\nB) Implement a two-step projection process: first projecting 3D points onto a reference ellipsoid, then applying the chosen map projection\nC) Use a hybrid approach that switches between direct 3D projection and ellipsoid-based projection depending on the map type\nD) Eliminate the concept of altitude entirely and work solely with 2D latitude and longitude coordinates\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate approach is B, implementing a two-step projection process. This aligns with standard cartographic practices described in the documentation. The first step involves projecting 3D points onto a reference ellipsoid (e.g., WGS84), which effectively incorporates the altitude information into the latitude and longitude coordinates. The second step then applies the chosen map projection to these ellipsoidal coordinates.\n\nThis approach is superior because:\n\n1. It follows the conventional process for creating maps, as mentioned in the documentation: \"the usual process for creating maps is to project the 3D points onto the chosen reference ellipsoid which yields (2D) LatLong coordinates, then transform the LatLong coordinates into map coordinates.\"\n\n2. It allows for consistency across different map projections. The documentation states that \"all map projections are doing the same process,\" implying that this two-step approach is standard.\n\n3. It doesn't truly \"lose\" altitude information, as the LatLong coordinates on the ellipsoid implicitly contain this information through the intersection of the rhumb-line with the ellipsoid surface.\n\n4. It provides flexibility to support a wide range of map projections, which is a stated goal of the software design.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't align with standard cartographic practices and may lead to inconsistencies when implementing different map projections. Option C introduces unnecessary complexity and potential inconsistencies. Option D oversimplifies the problem and loses valuable 3D information that's implicit in proper cartographic projections.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world software development scenario, and tests critical thinking about cartographic principles and software design."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/10", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/151644", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/66501/"], "docs_id": 151644, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to calculate the wavelength of radiation given its energy.\n\nI know I need to use $E\\=h f$ and $f \\= c / \\\\lambda$. \n\nAll I'm given is $E \\= 20 \\\\text{ keV}$, now my true question is:\n\nDo I use $E \\= 20 \\\\text{ keV}$ to calculate $f$ as it is, or do I need to convert it to $\\\\text{MeV}$ in order to use it? \n\nI ask this because the planck constant I have is $h \\= 4\\.135\\\\times 10^{\\-21} \\\\text{ MeV s}$ and so if I calculate the frequency with this value and then use it along with $c$ to find my wavelength, will the results not be wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me answer your question with a question.

"answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A linguistics researcher is developing a specialized English dictionary and needs to filter words based on specific criteria. Which of the following approaches would be most efficient and accurate for identifying four-letter words that are exclusively nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, while excluding inflected forms?\n\nA) Use a standard English dictionary and manually filter words based on length and part of speech\nB) Employ a web scraping tool to collect words from online dictionaries and apply custom filters\nC) Utilize the Moby Project's PoS-tagged wordlist with a regex pattern\nD) Develop a machine learning algorithm to classify words based on context from a large corpus\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and accurate approach for this task is to utilize the Moby Project's PoS-tagged wordlist with a regex pattern. This method directly addresses the researcher's needs for several reasons:\n\n1. The Moby Project's wordlist is already tagged with parts of speech, which eliminates the need for manual classification or complex algorithms.\n\n2. The regex pattern provided in the documentation (^([a-z]{4})\\\\[\\S]*?[VNAv]) efficiently filters for:\n   - Exactly four-letter words (^([a-z]{4}))\n   - Only nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs ([VNAv])\n   - Excludes inflected forms by targeting base words\n\n3. This approach is more precise than manual filtering (option A), which would be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n4. It's more reliable than web scraping (option B), which might introduce inconsistencies or errors from various online sources.\n\n5.

The researcher should reduce the number of levels to 17 or fewer.\n\nB) Sphericity is automatically assumed when there are more than 20 levels of a repeated measure. The researcher should proceed with the analysis using the sphericity assumed results.\n\nC) Mauchly's test is undefined due to insufficient degrees of freedom. The researcher should rely on Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt corrections regardless of their values.\n\nD) The covariance matrix is singular, making Mauchly's test incalculable. The researcher should examine the Lower-Bound Epsilon and consider alternative analytical approaches if it's substantially below 1.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about statistical procedures. The correct answer is C because when the number of repeated measure levels (24) is greater than or equal to the number of subjects (18), there are insufficient degrees of freedom to calculate Mauchly's test of sphericity. This results in the undefined output (W = .0, p = .).\n\nIn this situation, Mauchly's test cannot provide meaningful information about sphericity. However, the Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt corrections are still calculated and should be used. These corrections adjust the degrees of freedom to provide a more conservative test, which is particularly important when sphericity cannot be assessed directly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reducing the number of levels is not a valid solution and would change the nature of the study. Option B is incorrect because sphericity is not automatically assumed in this case; in fact, it's because sphericity cannot be reliably tested that we need to use the corrections. Option D touches on a related concept (singular covariance matrix) but incorrectly suggests that the Lower-Bound Epsilon alone should guide the decision, when in fact both Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt corrections should be considered.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply statistical knowledge to a real-world research scenario, understand the limitations of certain tests, and make appropriate decisions when standard assumptions cannot be tested."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/16", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/200645", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/141801/"], "docs_id": 200645, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a pdf file that has irregular page numbering (Roman numerals, then regular page numbers, then odd numbering scheme, etc..) created with Adobe Acrobat.

This suggests that the \"maximal\" model can be improved by simply discarding disp. The \"improved\" model includes only hp and wt as predictor variables and has an AIC of 63\\.840\\. \n\nWe now repeat the same process as the one described in the paragraph above \\- we start out with the \"improved\" model, eliminate each of the remaining predictors hp and wt in turns from the model and monitor how that impacts the AIC. If the AIC becomes smaller, that means that the eliminated predictor does not contribute much to the model. \n\nIn our example, we cannot reduce the \"improved\" model's AIC by eliminating either hp or wt from the model. In fact, when we eliminate each of these predictor variables from the model, the AIC increases, suggesting the elimination has a detrimental effect on the model. \n\nSo the \"final\" model is the one posted by R when we type the following command: \n\n```\nfit1_LM \n\n```\n\nIn other words, the \"final\" model is:\n\n```\n> fit1_LM \n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ hp + wt, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)           hp           wt  \n   37.22727     -0.03177     -3.87783  \n\n```\n\nThis model includes only hp and wt as predictor variables.

This approach has several important characteristics:\n\n1. Efficiency: It starts with the full model (all variables) and iteratively removes variables, which is computationally more efficient than testing all possible combinations.\n\n2. Balance: AIC balances model fit against complexity, penalizing overly complex models to reduce overfitting risk.\n\n3. Local optimization: The backward elimination process makes locally optimal decisions at each step, which may not necessarily lead to the globally optimal model.\n\n4. Limitations: It doesn't consider interactions or non-linear relationships unless explicitly included in the initial model.\n\n5. No cross-validation: The process doesn't inherently use separate training and validation data, which could lead to overfitting.\n\n6. Statistical focus: While it uses statistical criteria for selection, it doesn't incorporate domain knowledge or causal relationships.\n\nOption A is incorrect because stepAIC doesn't exhaustively test all combinations.

You have to make sure you don't exceed the maximum current, and the fast energy dump can't heat the die too much.\n\nThe first is obvious. Take the maximum capacitor voltage, divide it by the maximum allowed FET current, and that is the total series resistance needed. In theory, the cap's ESR and the FET's on\\-resistance contribute to the total series resistance. However, those two are usually specified as maximums that will not be exceeded, so you can't count on minimum values. The safe thing to do is to size the resistor as if it were there only series resistance.\n\nOnce you know the current is limited, you have to make sure the FET doesn't get too hot. Here you probably need to do some guessing and derating. The datasheet will tell you the maximum continuous dissipation the FET can handle for whatever conditions of cooling and heat\\-sinking you set up. However, it doesn't usually tell you how much energy it takes just to get to a particular temperature. You can exceed maximum continuous dissipation for a short term when starting from cold, but it's often not specified how much more dissipation for how long. Use common sense and be conservative.\n\nOne strategy is to have the resistor dissipate most of the cap's energy. In this case you use the FET's maximum guaranteed on resistance. The fraction of the total energy dissipated by each series element is its resistance divided by the total. For example, if the deliberate resistance is 500 m\u03a9 and the FET's maximum on resistance is 25 m\u03a9, then the FET is guaranteed to not dissipate more than (25 m\u03a9)/(525 m\u03a9) \\= 4\\.8% if the cap's energy.\n\nA larger series resistance slows the cap discharge time, and shifts more of the total dissipation to the resistor."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is troubleshooting a non-inverting op-amp circuit with a gain of 2, powered by a single 12V supply. The circuit works as expected for input voltages between 0.8V and 5V, but unexpectedly saturates at around 12V for input voltages below 0.8V. Which of the following modifications would most effectively address this issue while maintaining the circuit's functionality across the entire 0-5V input range?\n\nA) Add a voltage divider at the input to shift the input range\nB) Implement a dual-supply configuration with \u00b16V\nC) Increase the gain to compensate for the low-voltage saturation\nD) Add a small positive bias voltage to the non-inverting input\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The issue described is typical of a single-supply op-amp circuit operating near its lower rail. The op-amp cannot produce an output voltage below its negative supply rail (0V in this case), and it struggles to operate properly when its input is close to this rail. \n\nOption A (voltage divider) would reduce the overall input range and sensitivity, which is undesirable. \nOption B (dual supply) would work but is more complex and doesn't align with the \"single 12V/0V supply\" constraint mentioned.\nOption C (increasing gain) would exacerbate the problem at low voltages and exceed the desired output range.\n\nOption D, adding a small positive bias voltage to the non-inverting input, is the most effective solution. This bias shifts the input operating range slightly above the lower rail, allowing the op-amp to function properly even for very low input voltages. The bias can be implemented with a simple voltage divider network, and its effect can be compensated for in the feedback network to maintain the desired gain and output range. This solution maintains the single-supply configuration, preserves the full input range functionality, and addresses the low-voltage saturation issue with minimal circuit modification."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/26", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/182224", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/10405/"], "docs_id": 182224, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Star Wars Commander you are given a tract of virtual land where you can build your base.

Given the following scenario and database structure, what is the most effective strategy to improve performance and successfully generate tiles?\n\nA) Increase the RAM allocation for the virtual machine and add more CPU cores to handle the complex geometries\nB) Implement dynamic simplification of contour lines based on zoom levels and split long contours into smaller segments\nC) Convert the contour data from PostgreSQL to a file-based format like GeoJSON to reduce database query overhead\nD) Modify the database schema to store pre-rendered tiles at different zoom levels instead of generating them on-the-fly\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation and real-world GIS scenario. The correct answer, B, addresses the root cause of the performance issues as explained in the top answer.\n\nSplitting long contours into smaller segments improves the efficiency of spatial indexes by reducing the size and overlap of feature envelopes. This allows for more precise querying when rendering specific tiles. Additionally, implementing dynamic simplification based on zoom levels ensures that only relevant contour lines are rendered at each zoom level, reducing the amount of data processed and memory required.\n\nOption A is a common misconception that simply throwing more hardware resources at the problem will solve it. While it might help to some extent, it doesn't address the underlying inefficiencies in data structure and querying.\n\nOption C might seem plausible as it could reduce database query overhead, but it doesn't address the core issue of complex geometries and would likely introduce new performance problems when dealing with large datasets.\n\nOption D represents a different approach to tile serving that doesn't align with the current TileMill-based setup and wouldn't necessarily solve the issues with complex contour geometries.\n\nThe correct approach combines optimization of the spatial data structure (splitting contours) with intelligent rendering strategies (zoom-based simplification), addressing both the database querying efficiency and the rendering performance issues described in the documentation."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/18", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/328686", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/189958/"], "docs_id": 328686, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to implement a tree data structure that callers of my code edit for me to operate on. The idea is that the caller can hold a reference to nodes from the tree and modify their data (both attributes and children), which triggers an event that prompts my code to update a visual render of the tree.\n\nThe problem that I have is that **each node also needs to hold some private data (a reference to the corresponding visual element) which I don't want to have polluting the public interface of the node object**. The private data needs to be accessible by the main class that is handling the tree object.\n\nI *could* decide to just stick the private data onto my public interface like this:\n\n```\nclass Node\n{\n    public int NodeData;\n    public List<Node> ChildNodes;\n\n    public object PrivateVisualizationData;\n}\n\nclass TreeControl\n{\n    public Node RootNode;\n\n    // Use \"PrivateVisualizationData\" fields on node objects\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, this presents two problems as I see it:\n\n1. Any consumers of `Node` will see the `PrivateVisualizationData` field, which could be confusing\n2.

The correct answer, C, involves creating a subclass of Node (TreeControlNode in the example) that contains the private visualization data. This approach best addresses the requirements because:\n\n1. It maintains encapsulation by keeping the visualization data private within the TreeControl class, preventing external access and modification.\n2. It preserves the public interface of the Node class, avoiding confusion for consumers who don't need to know about visualization details.\n3. It minimizes management overhead by avoiding separate lookup tables or complex data structures.\n4. It allows the TreeControl class to work with its extended node type internally while presenting a clean public interface using the base Node class.\n\nOption A (composite pattern) would introduce unnecessary complexity and doesn't address the privacy concerns.

You could also use `chained_integers = list(map(int, chained))` and print the `chained_integers` before proceeding if you want to double\\-check that.\n\nAnd finally to `reduce` it I would actually use the built\\-in `sum` function:\n\n```\nreduced = sum(chained_integers)  # or \"reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, chained_integers)\"\n\n```\n\nOr the one\\-line\\-version:\n\n```\nsum(map(int, itertools.chain(num, num2, num3)))\n\n```\n\nAn alternative solution using a comprehension instead of `map`:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven simpler would be a comprehension (in this case I used a generator expression) instead of the `map`:\n\n```\nreduced = sum(int(v) for v in itertools.chain(num, num2, num3))\n\n```\n\nAn alternative solution using a generator function:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's pretty short and easy to understand but I would like to present another example of how to do it using your own generator function:\n\n```\ndef chain_as_ints(*iterables):\n    for iterable in iterables:\n        for item in iterable:\n            yield int(item)\n\n```\n\nAnd you could use it like this:\n\n```\nsum(chain_as_ints(num, num2, num3))\n\n```\n\nIn this case a generator function is not really necessary (and probably not advisable given the alternatives) I just wanted to mention it for completeness."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working with multiple lists of string representations of numbers and wants to combine them into a single list of integers, then sum the result.

It uses itertools.chain() to efficiently combine multiple iterables without creating intermediate lists. The map(int, ...) function then converts all elements to integers in a memory-efficient manner. Finally, the built-in sum() function is used instead of reduce(), which is both more readable and slightly more efficient for this specific task.\n\nOption A is less efficient as it would require multiple passes over the data and doesn't take advantage of Python's built-in functions. Option B unnecessarily creates an intermediate list when concatenating, which is less memory-efficient. Option D, while functional, introduces unnecessary complexity by creating a custom generator function when built-in tools can accomplish the task more simply.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (itertools, map(), sum()), tests the understanding of iterator efficiency, and applies these concepts to a real-world scenario of data processing.

decimal markers *and* the typesetting of thousands\\-separators, I recommend using the `S` column type of the `siunitx` package over the `D` column type of the `dcolumn` package.\n\nA nice side\\-effect of using the `S` column type is that it suffices to enclosed objects that shouldn't be aligned on decimal markers in curly braces; it is *not* necessary to write `\\multicolumn{1}{c}{...}`. Observe that in the code below, I've actually eliminated all hard\\-coded comma characters; it's the software setting `group-minimum-digits=4, group-separator={,}` that instructs LaTeX to typeset them. \n\nTo make the large table a bit easier to read, I would also add a bit of extra whitespace after every fifth row; this may be accomplished via the `\\addlinespace` directive.\n\n[![enter image

Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about LaTeX table formatting:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is creating a complex table in LaTeX with financial data that includes both large numbers and decimal values. They want to ensure proper alignment, readability, and consistency across columns. Given the information in the documentation, which approach would be most effective for formatting this table?\n\nA) Use the dcolumn package with the D column type for all numeric columns\nB) Apply the siunitx package with the S column type and custom formatting options\nC) Utilize the tabular environment with manual column specifications for each data type\nD) Implement the array package with custom column types for each numeric format\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach for this scenario is to use the siunitx package with the S column type and custom formatting options. This solution offers several advantages:\n\n1. Alignment: The S column type automatically aligns numbers on their decimal points, which is crucial for financial data presentation.\n\n2. Consistency: It allows for uniform formatting across all numeric columns, including both large numbers and decimal values.\n\n3. Readability: The package offers options like group-minimum-digits and group-separator to add thousands separators, enhancing readability of large numbers.\n\n4. Flexibility: It can handle both integers and decimals without requiring separate column specifications for each.\n\n5. Simplicity: The S column type simplifies the syntax for column definitions compared to manual specifications or multiple custom column types.\n\n6. Automatic formatting: It applies consistent formatting rules across the entire table without manual intervention for each cell.\n\nWhile the dcolumn package (option A) can align decimals, it lacks the advanced formatting options and flexibility of siunitx. The tabular environment with manual specifications (option C) would be cumbersome and error-prone for a complex table. The array package with custom column types (option D) could work but would require more complex setup and wouldn't offer the built-in formatting features of siunitx.\n\nThe documentation specifically highlights the benefits of using siunitx for this type of data, making it the most appropriate choice for the given scenario."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/09/06", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/106527", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/13707/"], "docs_id": 106527, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $\\\\mathcal{A}$ be an abelican category with enough injectives, let $K^\\\\bullet \\\\in Kom^\\+(\\\\mathcal{A})$ be a complex, where $Kom^\\+(\\\\mathcal{A})$ is the category of cochain complexes over $\\\\mathcal{A}$ bounded on the left.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that vanishing cohomology for n \u2265 m does not imply vanishing hypercohomology for n \u2265 m. This directly contradicts option A.\n\n2. While the hypercohomology of exact or acyclic complexes is indeed zero (as mentioned in the documentation), this is not the only case where hypercohomology vanishes. Therefore, option B is too restrictive.\n\n3. The example provided in the documentation demonstrates that even for a complex K\u2022 with H^n(K\u2022) = 0 for n \u2260 0 (which is a stronger condition than the one in the question), \u210d^n(K\u2022) can be non-zero for some n > 0.

The scope and probe risetimes are usually typical ones and may vary for each probe. Likewise there are a lot of other error sources, not the least one being uncertainty in the scopes sampling and limited resolution (in most digital scopes you see a sinc interpolation of the signal, try finding a dot display mode to see how many datapoints there really are that you can base your measurement of).\n\nThus trying to calculate it that way can only be called a rough estimate.\n\nLets try some numbers to get a feeling here:\n\nThe real perfect data:\n\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{1\\.4ns^2 \\+ 1\\.8ns^2 \\+ 0\\.7ns^2} \\= 2\\.385ns\\\\$\n\nLets assume the system rise time is perfect, but just not the scopes timing:\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{\\-1\\.4ns^2 \\- 1\\.8ns^2 \\+ 2\\.36ns^2} \\= 0\\.608ns\\\\$\n\nAnd now lets assume the scope and probes are a bit off too:\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{\\-1\\.45ns^2 \\- 1\\.85ns^2 \\+ 2\\.36ns^2} \\= 0\\.21ns\\\\$"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is measuring the rise time of a high-speed digital signal using an oscilloscope and probe with the following specifications:\n- Actual signal rise time: unknown\n- Probe rise time: 1.4 ns\n- Oscilloscope rise time: 1.8 ns\n- Measured rise time on the oscilloscope: 2.385 ns\n\nWhat is the most accurate estimate of the actual signal rise time, and what key factor should the engineer consider when interpreting this result?\n\nA) 0.7 ns; The square root relationship between system and signal rise times\nB) 1.185 ns; The additive nature of rise times in the measurement chain\nC) 0.7 ns; The potential variations in probe and oscilloscope specifications\nD) 0.608 ns; The perfect accuracy of the oscilloscope's timing system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach to estimating the actual signal rise time uses the formula:\nR_signal = \u221a(R_meas\u00b2 - R_system\u00b2), where R_system = \u221a(R_probe\u00b2 + R_scope\u00b2)\n\nCalculating this:\nR_signal = \u221a(2.385\u00b2 - (\u221a(1.4\u00b2 + 1.8\u00b2))\u00b2) \u2248 0.7 ns\n\nThis matches option A and C, but C is the correct answer because it also acknowledges a crucial consideration: the potential variations in probe and oscilloscope specifications.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding module dependencies, load order, and the impact of module status on configuration.\n\nThe developer correctly attempted to disable the plugin by adding a configuration in their custom module's di.xml file. They also properly declared a sequence in the module.xml file to ensure their module loads after Fooman_PdfCustomiser. The setup:di:compile command was executed, which should have processed these changes.\n\nHowever, the crucial detail is in the update section, where it's mentioned that the Company_App extension was disabled. In Magento 2, configurations from disabled modules are ignored during compilation and runtime. This explains why the plugin deactivation was not taking effect, despite the correct configuration being in place.\n\nThis scenario tests the developer's ability to consider all aspects of module management, including the often-overlooked importance of module status.

For the purposes of this question I will say that a compact complex manifold is projective if it is isomorphic to a subvariety of $\\\\mathbb{P}^n$ and algebraic if it is isomorphic to the complex analytic space associated to a scheme.\n\nOne often finds many examples of compact complex manifolds which are not projective. For instance Hopf and Inoue surfaces, some K3, some tori... Usually the proof shows that either this manifold is not Kahler, or the Kahler cone does not intersect the lattice of integral cohomology. But of course this does not tell us anything about their being algebraic in the sense outlined above.\n\nSo there are two questions. First, what is an example of a compact complex manifold which is not algebraic? Probably this is standard, but I don't have any reference in mind. I think that the complex analytic space associated to a smooth algebraic space which is not a scheme will do, but I'm not expert of algebraic spaces, so I don't have even such an example in mind.\n\nThe second, subtler, question is: are the examples above of nonprojective complex manifold also non algebraic?

In fact it's very common, especially when wiring ceiling fans. The power (2 wire /w ground) enters the switch box, then a switched hot and unswitched hot are supplied to the fan (3 wire /w ground). This allows the light to be toggled by the wall switch, while the fan is toggled by the switch on the fixture. It's also a common practice to wire duplex receptacles this way, where one half of the device is always powered and the other half is controlled by a switch (in which case the tab separating the two halves should be removed on the ungrounded (hot) side). \n\nThe grounded (neutral) conductor will carry the combined current of the two ungrounded (hot) conductors, so any inductive coupling will still be canceled out. Since the circuit is protected by an overcurrent device (circuit breaker/fuse), there is no way to overload the grounded (neutral) conductor. The current on the ungrounded (hot) conductors will be limited by the overcurrent device, so too much current *should* never flow on the neutral."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is wiring a new home office and wants to provide both switched and unswitched power to various outlets in the room.

However this causes problems with understanding the setup for users, who are used to work with solutions, that handle SNAT in one single step.\n\nThe first step are SNAT actions. They ONLY define different possible combinations of external\\-2\\-internal IP address translation and the internal port you would want to translate to. This is just a list of possibilities you set up like Aliases. None of them is active, until you use it in a firewall rule.\n\nFor RDP connections, you would set up a SNAT actions like these:\n\n```\nName: Ext_123-RDP_101\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.101:3389 \n\nName: Ext_123-RDP_102\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.102:3389 \n\nName: Ext_123-RDP_103\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.103:3389 \n\n```\n\nSo that is the translation part.\nNext you need to set up firewall rules. Since it is never smart to leave open RDP ports, I would use authenticated users (authenticating them over <https://firewall_IP:4100>) that belong to a group 'Allow\\-RDP'.\n\nYou will need 3 rules, that will use the SNAT actions you have have already defined. Since there is no standard service for ports 3111\\-311x, you will create a custom template called SNAT\\-RDP and add a TCP port range 3111\\-3113 and than create the 3 new firewall rules based on this template.\n\n```\nName the new rules something like 'RDP-IN-101', 'RDP-IN-102' and 'RDP-IN-103'\n\n'RDP-IN-101':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_101 SNAT Action\n\n'RDP-IN-102':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_102 SNAT Action\n\n'RDP-IN-103':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_103 SNAT Action\n\n```\n\nTo have some control over the happening, you should also turn on logging for these rules.\n\nBut that's it. Upload to the FB and enjoy.\n\nIn this case, the SNAT action is not really a simplification. But if you have some more general SNAT e.g. for some server, you would need just one 'reusable' SNAT action for all the rules, that connect from one external IP address to that server.

This method involves:\n\n1. Creating three separate SNAT actions, each mapping the external IP (123.123.123.123) to one of the internal IPs (10.10.10.101, 10.10.10.102, 10.10.10.103) and the standard RDP port (3389).\n2. Defining a custom service template (SNAT-RDP) for the external ports (3111-3113).\n3. Creating three firewall rules, each using one of the SNAT actions and the custom service template.\n4.

After implementing the changes, the method is not accessible in the product list and view pages. Given the provided code snippets and common Magento extension practices, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The class name in the Block file doesn't match the module's namespace structure\nB) The `config.xml` file is missing the correct `<rewrite>` tags for block overrides\nC) The custom block class is extending the wrong core Magento class\nD) The module's `config.xml` file is not properly registering the custom block class\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary issue in the given code is that the `config.xml` file is not correctly set up to rewrite the core Magento blocks. In Magento, to extend functionality of core blocks, you need to use the `<rewrite>` tag in the `config.xml` file. The current `config.xml` is missing this crucial element.\n\nThe correct structure should be:\n\n```xml\n<global>\n    <blocks>\n        <catalog>\n            <rewrite>\n                <product_list>Namespace_Catalog_Block_Catalog_Product_List</product_list>\n                <product_view>Namespace_Catalog_Block_Catalog_Product_View</product_view>\n            </rewrite>\n        </catalog>\n    </blocks>\n</global>\n```\n\nThis setup tells Magento to use the custom block classes instead of the core ones. Without this, Magento continues to use the core classes, which is why the custom method is not accessible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the class name structure is important, it's not the primary issue here. The class name actually follows the correct convention for the given module structure.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that the extension is correct (`extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List`), but this is not the root cause of the inaccessibility of the custom method.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the `config.xml` file does attempt to register the custom block class, albeit incorrectly.

Could anyone give me a hint on the setup? Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **You have to assume the devices in any box are independent.** When that is the case, the number of working devices in any box must follow a Binomial distribution. The parameters are $400$ (the number of devices in the box) and $.95$ (the working rate).\n\nSuppose you guarantee $k$ or more devices per box work. You are saying that at least 95% of all such boxes contain $k$ or more working devices. In the language of random variables and distributions, you are asserting that the chance of a Binomial$(400, 0\\.95\\)$ variable equaling or exceeding $k$ is at least $95\\\\%$. The solution is found by computing the $100\\-95$ \\= fifth percentile of this distribution. The only delicate part is that since this is a discrete distribution, we should take some care not to be one off in our answer.\n\n`R` tells us the fifth percentile is $k\\=373$:\n\n```\nqbinom(.05, 400, .95)\n\n```\n\n> 373\n\nLet's check by computing the chance of equaling or exceeding this value:\n\n```\npbinom(373-1, 400, .95, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n```\n\n> 0\\.9520076\n\n(Somewhat counter\\-intuitively, for me at least, is that the `lower.tail=FALSE` argument of `R`'s `pbinom` function does *not* include the value of its argument. Thus, `pbinom(k,n,p,lower.tail=FALSE)` computes the chance associated with an outcome *strictly* greater than `k`.)\n\nAs a double\\-check, let's confirm that we cannot guarantee even a larger value: \n\n```\npbinom(373, 400, .95, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n```\n\n> 0\\.9273511\n\nThus, the threshold of $0\\.95$ falls between these two successive probabilities.\n\nIn other words, we have found that\n\n> In the long run $95\\.2\\\\%$ of the boxes will contain $k\\=373$ or more working devices, but only $92\\.7\\\\%$ of them will contain $374$ or more working devices. Therefore we should not guarantee any more than $373$ if we want $95\\\\%$ or more of the boxes to meet this standard.\n\nIncidentally, a Normal distribution *turns out* to be an excellent approximation for this particular question. (Rather than display the answer you would get, I will leave it to you to do the calculation, since you requested information only on how to set up the problem.)\n\nThis plot compares the Binomial distribution function to its approximating Normal probability.\n\n[![figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iotJf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iotJf.png)\n\nThe two don't perfectly agree\\-\\-*but near $k\\=373$ they are very close indeed.*"}, "answer": "Certainly! Based on the provided documentation and guidelines, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: An electronics company is developing a new quality control process for their device production line. They want to implement a system that flags boxes of devices for additional inspection if the number of working devices falls below a certain threshold. Given that devices work properly 95% of the time and are shipped in boxes of 400, what would be the most appropriate threshold to set for flagging boxes, assuming they want to minimize unnecessary inspections while still catching most problematic batches?\n\nA) 365 working devices\nB) 373 working devices\nC) 380 working devices\nD) 385 working devices\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of statistical concepts in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B (373 working devices) for the following reasons:\n\n1. We need to use the Binomial distribution, as we're dealing with a fixed number of independent trials (400 devices) each with a probability of success (95% working rate).\n\n2. The key is to find a balance between catching problematic batches and avoiding unnecessary inspections. This means finding a threshold that's low enough to be unusual for a normal batch, but not so low that it misses too many issues.\n\n3. From the documentation, we know that 373 is the largest number of working devices that can be guaranteed in 95% of boxes.

They have an input tensor of size 64\u00d764\u00d7128 and want to apply 48 convolution filters of size 3\u00d73 with stride 1 and 'same' padding. If they need to reduce the total number of multiplications by approximately 25% while maintaining similar feature extraction capabilities, which of the following modifications is most likely to achieve this goal?\n\nA) Reduce the number of filters to 36 and increase the filter size to 4\u00d74\nB) Implement depthwise separable convolutions with the same number of filters\nC) Reduce the input tensor dimensions to 56\u00d756\u00d7128 and keep other parameters constant\nD) Increase the stride to 2 and double the number of filters to 96\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing the impact of various modifications on the number of multiplications in a convolutional layer:\n\n1. The original number of multiplications is 64\u00d764\u00d7128\u00d73\u00d73\u00d748 = 141,557,760.\n\n2. Option A: 64\u00d764\u00d7128\u00d74\u00d74\u00d736 = 150,994,944 multiplications, which increases the total.\n\n3. Option C: 56\u00d756\u00d7128\u00d73\u00d73\u00d748 = 108,281,856 multiplications, which is close to a 25% reduction but alters the input.\n\n4. Option D: With stride 2, the output size becomes 32\u00d732. So, 32\u00d732\u00d7128\u00d73\u00d73\u00d796 = 70,778,880 multiplications, but this significantly changes the network architecture.\n\n5. Option B (Correct): Depthwise separable convolutions separate the spatial and channel-wise convolutions. It consists of:\n   - Depthwise: 64\u00d764\u00d7128\u00d73\u00d73 = 2,949,120\n   - Pointwise: 64\u00d764\u00d7128\u00d748 = 25,165,824\n   Total: 28,114,944 multiplications, which is about a 80% reduction.\n\nWhile option B provides more than the requested 25% reduction, it's the most suitable choice as it maintains the input and output dimensions, preserves the number of filters, and significantly reduces computations without drastically altering the network architecture.

Does anyone know literature on that?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The MLE method can be applied in cases where someone knows the basic functional *form* of the pdf (e.g., it's Gaussian, or log\\-normal, or exponential, or whatever), but not the underlying parameters; e.g., they don't know the values of $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\sigma$ in the pdf: $$f(x\\|\\\\mu, \\\\sigma) \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^{2}}} \\\\exp\\\\left\\[\\\\frac{\\-(x\\-\\\\mu)^{2}}{2 \\\\sigma^{2}}\\\\right]$$ or whatever other type of pdf they are assuming. The job of the MLE method is to choose the best (i.e., most plausible) values for the unknown parameters, given the particular data measurements $x\\_{1}, x\\_{2}, x\\_{3}, ...$ which were actually observed. So to answer your first question, yes, you are always within your rights to ask someone what *form* of pdf they are assuming for their maximum likelihood estimate; indeed, the estimated parameter values that they tell you aren't even meaningful unless they first communicate that context.\n\nThe EM algorithm, as I've seen it applied in the past, is more of a sort of meta algorithm, where some of the metadata is missing, and you have to estimate that also. So, for example, perhaps I have a pdf which is a mixture of several Gaussians, e.g.: $$ f(x\\|A\\_{1},...,A\\_{N},\\\\mu\\_{1},...,\\\\mu\\_{N}, \\\\sigma\\_{1},...\\\\sigma\\_{N}) \\= \\\\sum\\_{k\\=1}^{N} \\\\frac{A\\_{k}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma\\_{k}^{2}}} \\\\exp\\\\left\\[\\\\frac{\\-(x\\-\\\\mu\\_{k})^{2}}{2 \\\\sigma\\_{k}^{2}}\\\\right] $$ Superficially, except for the addition of the amplitude parameter $A\\_{k}$, this looks a lot like the previous problem, but what if I told you that we also don't even know the value of $N$ (i.e, the number of modes in the Gaussian mixture) and we want to estimate that from the data measurements $x\\_{1}, x\\_{2}, x\\_{3}, ...$ too?\n\nIn this case, you have a problem, because each possible value of $N$ (this is the \"meta\" part that I was alluding to above) really generates a different model, in some sense. If $N\\=1$, then you have a model with three parameters ($A\\_{1}$, $\\\\mu\\_{1}$, $\\\\sigma\\_{1}$) whereas if $N\\=2$, then you have a model with six parameters ($A\\_{1}$, $A\\_{2}$, $\\\\mu\\_{1}$, $\\\\mu\\_{2}$, $\\\\sigma\\_{1}$, $\\\\sigma\\_{2}$). The best fit values that you obtain for ($A\\_{1}$, $\\\\mu\\_{1}$, $\\\\sigma\\_{1}$) in the $N\\=1$ model can't directly be compared to the best fit values that you obtain for those same parameters in the $N\\=2$ model, because they are different models with a different number of [degrees of freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_%28statistics%29).\n\nThe role of the EM algorithm is to provide a mechanism for making those types of comparisons (usually by imposing a [\"complexity penalty\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29) that prefers smaller values of $N$) so that we can choose the best overall value for $N$.\n\nSo, to answer your original question, the EM algorithm requires a less precise specification of the form of the pdf; one might say that it considers a range of alternative options (e.g., the option where $N\\=1$, $N\\=2$, $N\\=3$, etc.) but it still requires you to specify something about the basic mathematical form of those options\\-\\-you still have to specify a \"family\" of possible pdfs, in some sense, even though you are letting the algorithm decide for you which \"member\" of the family provides the best fit to the data."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about estimation methods and models, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An economist is working with a panel data model where a key variable (\u03b8_i) is unobserved but can be estimated in a separate regression.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. The problem stems from using an estimate of \u03b8_i, which introduces measurement error and leads to inconsistency due to correlation with x_it.\n\n2. Option A (EM algorithm) is not ideal here because the issue isn't about missing data or determining the number of components in a mixture model, which are typical EM applications.\n\n3. Option B (MLE with mixture distribution) doesn't directly address the correlation issue between the error term and x_it.\n\n4. Option C (2SLS) could potentially work if valid instruments were available, but it doesn't directly incorporate the uncertainty about \u03b8_i.\n\n5. Option D (Bayesian hierarchical model) is the most appropriate because:\n   - It can naturally incorporate the uncertainty about \u03b8_i by treating it as a random variable with a prior distribution.\n   - It allows for the simultaneous estimation of \u03b8_i and other model parameters, accounting for the uncertainty in \u03b8_i throughout the estimation process.\n   - It can handle the correlation between x_it and the error term by modeling the joint distribution of all variables.\n   - This approach aligns with the need to estimate parameters when some are unknown or estimated with error, which is a key theme in the documentation about MLE and model uncertainty.\n\nThis solution requires applying statistical concepts to an econometric problem, demonstrating higher-order thinking in Bloom's taxonomy by analyzing the problem, evaluating different methods, and synthesizing a solution that best fits the given scenario."}, "62": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/22", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/75360", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/28378/"], "docs_id": 75360, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my App folder \\-\\> /public\\_html/app/design/frontend, there are 3 folders, base, default, rwd.

The correct approach is to create a new theme in the 'rwd' folder, inheriting from the base RWD theme. This solution offers several advantages:\n\n1. It utilizes the existing responsive framework provided by the RWD package, saving development time and ensuring compatibility with Magento's responsive features.\n2.

It's very hard to say without actually being there. \n\nSome tips:\n\n* Try to avoid opening exterior walls, as they have insulation and vapour barrier that makes repair much more complicated.\n* If you can get at the wire from the opposite side in a closet or similar discreet space, that can make things much easier.\n* Unless you painted very recently *and* have leftover paint, even color matching you probably won't get it 100%, and if you just paint over a spot on the wall, this is usually noticeable. Instead, if you paint the whole wall, the fact that adjacent walls (around corners) don't match 100% is not noticeable. Keep this in mind when choosing where to cut (eg, choose smallest walls possible).\n* It may also be possible to get at the wire somewhere directly:\n\t+ If outlets cross doorways, there's a good chance the wire runs under the floor, and if it's an unfinished ceiling underneath, you can tap into the wire there.\n\t+ You might also be able to get at the wire in the wall, but this may be a bit of a guessing game. Non\\-contact circuit detectors (many stud finders have these) can help. Cut a small hole to inspect before cutting a bigger one to work in.\n\t+ You'll probably need two junctions to have enough slack. Keep in mind all j\\-boxes must be permanently accessible, so you may need to add an outlet or blank faceplate to make this work.\n\n---\n\nSmall variation is you could disconnect the outlets from the switch, and keep the circuit you drew for the switches/lights in place exactly as\\-is.

This approach aligns with the top answer's suggestion of running a new power line from the outlets to the switch, then to the lights/fan. \n\nThis solution is preferred because:\n\n1.

It just means you can have only one filesystem and nothing else on it (no swap partition, etc...). However, it is unlikely that such a block device is bootable.

Documents are added/updated in that index whenever the content of the application is being changed and deleted whenever the corresponding content is deleted.\n\nWe had a bug where the trigger to update a document on content changes did not work in some cases. Therefore some of the documents contain invalid (out\\-dated) values. This problem has been resolved, so future changes will be correctly written to the index.\n\nHowever I want to fix the invalid documents in the index and would like to know what the best strategy would be to do so. Important conditions are:\n\n* Recalculating the complete index requires multiple hours and the application is redeployed regularly as part of continuous deployment. Therefore it must be expected that the application is shut down in between the updating process.\n* Most of the documents are not invalid.\n* I'm not able to recognize invalid documents based on the index alone. This would require lots of information from a database.\n* The invalid values of the documents are not particularly important. The most relevant field (the name) was not affected by the bug. Therefore even documents with invalid values work correctly in most of the use cases.\n* I would like a solution that will work for future issues too.\n\nI think a similar case occurs if we extend the index in future versions, e.g. add a field. This would require us to update all documents to add the field, while the main use case of the index will work without that field too.\n\nPossible solution\n-----------------\n\nMy idea is to add a version field to the documents. I would then add a job that runs all few minutes, fetches a batch of documents with an old version (or without any version for the initial run), recalculate the required fields, set the version field to the current version and update the document in the index.\n\nPros of this solution:\n\n* If the update is interrupted, the application recognizes which documents are already fixed and which aren't.\n* This information is stored within the index, so where it belongs (I had some ideas before where I would store the information in the database).\n\nCon of this solution:\n\n* Will need to update every document, even if it has no invalid values.\n\nMy question\n-----------\n\nIs this a reasonable solution for the problem?

Turns out, with Lucene, rebuilding the entire index using code optimized for it, starting from the scratch, using a `SELECT field1, field2 FROM table` query with no where clause, was quite fast. The reason for the quick execution time probably was that the Lucene\\-interfacing code didn't need to worry about parallel Lucene queries, and the SQL statement could use a sequential scan.\n\nFor this reason, we had `indexOne` and `indexAll` methods, separately written.\n\nI'm not sure if it's fast enough for your case, but you should take a hard look at the Lucene API, see what kind of performance\\-improving characteristics it has: don't synchronize for every single item? Don't care about parallel queries? Rebuild the index from the scratch? I don't remember what features of the Lucene API we used to obtain the great performance because it was 8 years ago, but I do recall the performance of `indexAll` was much better than `indexOne`.\n\nOf course, this kind of approach requires some downtime. But with good enough optimization, perhaps you can push the downtime to an acceptable level, from hours to merely minutes.\n\nIf you are unable to push the downtime to an acceptable level, your only solution is a background indexer. We had a table named `indexqueue` in the database, and it contained object identifiers. The background indexer regularly fetched rows from this table and reindexed only those rows fetched. Then you just insert every object identifier to the `indexqueue` table and wait for all to be reindexed.\n\nAs for the record count, we had millions of records. Your hundreds of thousands of records problem, with the slight progress in computer performance over 8 years and the great progress in computer memory amount, is minuscule in comparison to the millions of records of problem we had. We used spinning hard disks back then, and today's servers use SSDs!\n\nI'm pretty sure you can reindex thousands of rows per second, if doing things optimally, unless of course each row has some kind of 1000 page book text body. This makes it hundreds of thousands of rows per minute."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is tasked with fixing an issue where some documents in a Lucene search index contain outdated values due to a resolved bug. The application uses Spring Framework and is frequently redeployed. Given the constraints, which approach would be most effective for updating the index while minimizing disruption to the application?\n\nA) Implement a version field and run a background job to update batches of documents\nB) Rebuild the entire index during off-peak hours using optimized Lucene API calls\nC) Create an indexqueue table and process updates through a background indexer\nD) Add a flag to mark outdated documents and update them on-the-fly during searches\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options have merit, option C (Create an indexqueue table and process updates through a background indexer) is the most effective solution given the constraints and requirements outlined in the documentation. Here's why:\n\n1. Continuous operation: This approach allows for updating the index without requiring downtime, which is crucial given the frequent redeployments mentioned.\n\n2. Selective updates: By using an indexqueue table, only the affected documents need to be processed, addressing the fact that \"Most of the documents are not invalid.\"\n\n3. Database integration: This method easily integrates with the existing database, which is necessary since \"I'm not able to recognize invalid documents based on the index alone. This would require lots of information from a database.\"\n\n4. Flexibility for future issues: The indexqueue approach is adaptable and \"will work for future issues too,\" as requested.\n\n5. Efficiency: As mentioned in the top answer, this method can be highly efficient, potentially processing \"thousands of rows per second.\"\n\nOption A (version field and background job) is close but less optimal as it would update every document unnecessarily. Option B (rebuilding the entire index) doesn't meet the requirement of handling frequent redeployments. Option D (on-the-fly updates) could potentially impact search performance and doesn't address the need for a comprehensive solution.\n\nThe indexqueue approach provides the best balance of efficiency, flexibility, and minimal disruption to the application's operation, making it the most suitable solution for the described scenario."}, "73": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/11", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/85387", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/20466/"], "docs_id": 85387, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume that $I\\\\subset k\\[x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n]$ and $J\\\\subset k\\[y\\_1,\\\\ldots,y\\_m]$ are monomial ideals in different rings, and the minimal free resolution of $S/I$ and $S/J$, say $F\\_\\\\cdot$ and $G\\_\\\\cdot$, are both linear.

(1\\) When is the complex $F\\\\otimes G$ exact? (2\\) If it is exact, when is $F\\\\otimes G$ a minimal free resolution?\n\nThe first question is computed by Tor. Namely $F\\\\otimes G$ is exact if and only if $\\\\text{Tor}\\_i(S/I,S/J)\\=0$ for all $i\\>0$\n\nI believe that the second question is easier. Since the differential $\\\\partial$ on $F\\\\otimes G$ is defined in terms of differentials on $F$ and $G$ (which were assumed to be minimal free resolutions), we see that $\\\\partial (F\\\\otimes G)\\_i$ belongs to the maximal ideal times $(F\\\\otimes G)\\_{i\\-1}$. Thus, $F\\\\otimes G$ is a minimal free resolution if and only if it is exact.\n\nOf course, in your example where $S\\=k\\[x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n,y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_m]$, and $I$ only involves $x$\\-variables and $J$ and only involves $y$\\-variables, then the higher Tor's vanish and thus $F\\\\otimes G$ is a minimal free resolution."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about tensor products of chain complexes and minimal free resolutions, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is working with two monomial ideals I \u2282 k[x\u2081,...,x\u2099] and J \u2282 k[y\u2081,...,y\u2098] in different polynomial rings.

The key points are:\n\n1. The exactness of F \u2297 G is determined by Tor groups: F \u2297 G is exact if and only if Tor\u1d62(S/I, S/J) = 0 for all i > 0.\n2. For F \u2297 G to be a minimal free resolution, it must be both exact and have its differential maps sending elements to the maximal ideal times the previous module.\n3. The linearity of F\u208b and G\u208b ensures that the differential maps of F \u2297 G satisfy the minimality condition.\n\nTherefore, the exactness condition (Tor\u1d62(S/I, S/J) = 0 for all i > 0) is both necessary and sufficient for F \u2297 G to be a minimal free resolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes. Option B only considers Tor\u2081, which is insufficient. Option D describes a specific case where the condition is met but is not the general requirement.

The T-invariance of f can be proven almost everywhere without relying on the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem or other advanced ergodic theory concepts. The key is to use a more elementary argument based on the properties of T-invariant measures and the Radon-Nikodym derivative.\n\nThe proof, as outlined in Peter Walters' book, involves showing that for any rational r > 0, the set of points where f(x) and f(Tx) differ with respect to r has \u03bc-measure zero. This is done by defining Er = {x: f(x) < r} and showing that \u03bc(T\u207b\u00b9Er \\ Er) = \u03bc(Er \\ T\u207b\u00b9Er) = 0.\n\nThis approach demonstrates that f(x) = f(Tx) \u03bc-almost everywhere without using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem.

Therefore, as angles,\n\n```\nr1 = 107.5 / 60 Degree = 0.0312705 radian\nr2 = 145 / 60 Degree = 0.0421788 radian\n\n```\n3. The *geodesic* circle of radius r1 around x1 is the intersection of the earth's surface with a *Euclidean* sphere of radius sin(r1\\) centered at cos(r1\\)\\*x1\\.\n4. The plane determined by the intersection of the sphere of radius sin(r1\\) around cos(r1\\)\\*x1 and the earth's surface is perpendicular to x1 and passes through the point cos(r1\\)*x1, whence its equation is x.x1 \\= cos(r1\\) (the \".\" represents the [usual dot product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition)); likewise for the other plane. There will be a unique point x0 on the intersection of those two planes that is a linear combination of x1 and x2\\. Writing x0 \\= a*x1 \\+ b\\*x2 the two planar equations are\n\n```\ncos(r1) = x.x1 = (a*x1 + b*x2).x1 = a + b*(x2.x1)\ncos(r2) = x.x2 = (a*x1 + b*x2).x2 = a*(x1.x2) + b\n\n```\n\nUsing the fact that x2\\.x1 \\= x1\\.x2, which I shall write as q, the solution (if it exists) is given by\n\n```\na = (cos(r1) - cos(r2)*q) / (1 - q^2),\nb = (cos(r2) - cos(r1)*q) / (1 - q^2).\n\n```\n\nIn the running example, I compute a \\= 0\\.973503 and b \\= 0\\.0260194\\.\n\nEvidently we need q^2 !\\= 1\\. This means that x1 and x2 can be neither the same point nor antipodal points.\n5. Now all other points on the line of intersection of the two planes differ from x0 by some multiple of a vector n which is mutually perpendicular to both planes. The cross product\n\n```\nn = x1~Cross~x2\n\n```\n\ndoes the job provided n is nonzero: once again, this means that x1 and x2 are neither coincident nor diametrically opposite. (We need to take care to compute the cross product with high precision, because it involves subtractions with a lot of cancellation when x1 and x2 are close to each other.) In the example, n \\= (0\\.0272194, \\-0\\.00631254, \\-0\\.00803124\\).\n6. Therefore, we seek up to two points of the form x0 \\+ t\\*n which lie on the earth's surface: that is, their length equals 1\\. Equivalently, their *squared* length is 1:\n\n```\n1 = squared length = (x0 + t*n).(x0 + t*n) = x0.x0 + 2t*x0.n + t^2*n.n = x0.x0 + t^2*n.n\n\n```\n\nThe term with x0\\.n disappears because x0 (being a linear combination of x1 and x2\\) is perpendicular to n. The two solutions easily are\n\n```\nt = sqrt((1 - x0.x0)/n.n)\n\n```\n\nand its negative. Once again high precision is called for, because when x1 and x2 are close, x0\\.x0 is *very* close to 1, leading to some loss of floating point precision. In the example, t \\= 1\\.07509 or t \\= \\-1\\.07509\\. The two points of intersection therefore equal\n\n```\nx0 + t*n = (0.0257661, -0.798332, 0.601666)\nx0 - t*n = (-0.0327606, -0.784759, 0.618935)\n\n```\n7. Finally, we may convert these solutions back to (lat, lon) by converting geocentric (x,y,z) to geographic coordinates:\n\n```\nlon = ArcTan(x,y)\nlat = ArcTan(Sqrt[x^2+y^2], z)\n\n```\n\nFor the longitude, use the generalized arctangent returning values in the range \\-180 to 180 degrees (in computing applications, this function takes *both* x and y as arguments rather than just the ratio y/x; it is sometimes called \"ATan2\").\n\nI obtain the two solutions (\\-88\\.151426, 36\\.989311\\) and (\\-92\\.390485, 38\\.238380\\), shown in the figure as yellow dots.\n\n![3D figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/C13dY.png)\n\nThe axes display the geocentric (x,y,z) coordinates.

Find the line of intersection between the planes defined by these intersections.\n5. Calculate the points where this line intersects the Earth's surface.\n\nThis method is superior because:\n- It accounts for the Earth's curvature without approximation.\n- It avoids the distortions introduced by map projections (option A).\n- It's more precise than using great circles (option B), which don't accurately represent the search areas.\n- It provides a direct solution, unlike iterative methods (option D) which may have convergence issues or be less efficient.\n\nThe approach leverages the geometric properties of spheres and their intersections, allowing for an elegant and accurate solution to a complex geospatial problem.

The following should provide a good starting point:\n\n* Ansible: this should be used to actually *provision* the server. If the Ansible tasks are written correctly, they can be idempotent (run multiple times with no worries), and will only update/change whatever needs to be changed. The typical way to use Ansible is to run it \"remotely\" using SSH, but I recommend using Ansible in \"local\" mode (explained below).\n* Shell scripts: if anything specific/complex needs to occur on boot, or at the end of the Ansible run, it's best to move it to a shell script which can be called separately. When writing shell scripts, ensure they are POSIX compliant and don't contain too much crazy logic, this way they can run safely on various operating systems, and won't be too difficult to debug down the line.\n* Pull, not push: since your customers need to download binaries, you can host them on a local/private HTTPS server, and have your Ansible scripts \"pull\" (download) the binaries. You can even add an sha256 hash in your Ansible YAML config files to verify the integrity of the downloads. Of course development will be a bit slower if you always need to update the hash in the config files, but if you don't change the binaries too often (ex: once a month), it's an acceptable approach.\n* Virtual machines: if you setup a virtual machine, you can test your Ansible and shell scripts on there without affecting your customer's servers. This allows you to catch errors and avoid destroying a production server.\n\nMy approach is the following:\n\n* Ensure the server has Git and Ansible installed.\n* Ensure the server has an SSH private key to git pull from either GitHub or a private git\\+ssh server.\n* SSH into the server, and perform a `git pull`, then `ansible-playbook -c local`\n\nAnsible in \"local\" mode requires your server to have Ansible installed, but it has the advantage that provisioning is much faster, and doesn't require a network connection (except for the initial git pull).\n\nThis method allows your customers to manually decide when a server gets updated, and allows you/them to verify code pushed to the Git repo, before running Ansible on the server. If you're using GitHub to keep track of your Ansible scripts, then you can create a bot account for pulling the repo changes (allowed as per GitHub's ToS), or use your server's public SSH key as a deploy key.\n\nI've listed a few other best practices for building software for on\\-premises, which you can read about [here](http://blog.unscramble.co.jp/post/155653778918/best-practices-for-building-on-prem-appliances) for additional tips."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company is planning to improve its on-premise deployment process for enterprise customers. Given the current challenges and constraints described, which approach would most effectively address the issues while maintaining security and customer control?\n\nA) Implement a fully automated continuous deployment pipeline using cloud-based tools, pushing updates directly to customer servers\nB) Develop a hybrid solution using Ansible for local provisioning, version-controlled scripts, and a pull-based update mechanism\nC) Outsource the entire deployment process to a third-party vendor specializing in on-premise installations\nD) Replace the current system with a containerized microservices architecture deployed via Kubernetes on customer infrastructure\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate solution given the constraints and challenges described in the documentation. Here's why:\n\n1. Ansible for local provisioning addresses the need for automation, reducing manual errors in configuration and setup. It can be run in \"local\" mode, which doesn't require constant network access to customer servers.\n\n2. Version-controlled scripts (both Ansible playbooks and shell scripts) ensure consistency across deployments and allow for easy auditing and rollback if needed.\n\n3. A pull-based update mechanism respects the customer's need for control over when updates are applied, addressing the requirement for change requests to be signed off.\n\n4. This approach doesn't require constant VPN access or push access to customer servers, working within the described limitations of customer server access.\n\n5. It allows for testing in virtual environments before deployment, reducing the risk of errors in production.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes direct push access to customer servers and doesn't account for the need for customer approval of changes.

Flexibility: The 'find' command can be easily modified to include additional search criteria or actions if needed.\n\n5. Built-in functionality: Unlike option C, which requires writing a custom script, 'find' is a standard Unix/Linux command, reducing the chance of errors.\n\n6. Real-time results: Compared to option D (locate), 'find' provides real-time results without relying on a potentially outdated database.\n\nOption A (grep) is less suitable because it searches file contents rather than names, which is unnecessary and potentially slower for this task.\n\nOption C (custom shell script) is overly complex for this simple task and more prone to errors.\n\nOption D (locate) relies on a database that may not be up-to-date, potentially missing recently created files.\n\nThe 'find' command (option B) strikes the best balance between efficiency, accuracy, and simplicity for this specific task, making it the most appropriate choice for a DevOps engineer in this scenario."}, "93": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/09/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71560", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3367/"], "docs_id": 71560, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know that you're generally told to align binary operators to the right of a relation symbol like this (using `{align*}`):\n\n```\n\\begin{align*}\nx={}&a+b+c\\\\\n    &+d+e+f\n\\end{align*}\n\n```\n\nBut would it look better (though be more error prone) to do something like this to get the \\+ exactly flush with the a?\n\n```\n\\begin{align*}\nx={}&a+b+c\\\\\n    &{+}\\: d+e+f\n\\end{align*}\n\n```\n\n(That is, use braces to turn the \\+ into an ordinary symbol and add the medium space between the \\+ and the d by hand.)\n\nEdit: I'm trying to do exactly what's said in rule 3\\.3\\.5b, \"Break at conjunctions and align to the right of the first verb\", on page 46 of *Mathematics into Type* (updated edition, 1999\\).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First I want to summarize and discuss the variants.\n\n```\n\\begin{align*}\nx={}&a+b+c\\\\\n    &+d+e+f\n\\end{align*}\n\n```\n\n> ![Unaligned](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qGMX.png)\n\nTeX adds space around binary operators in display and text style, thus the `+` is moved to the right and destroys the alignment.\n\nThe variant of cmhughes aligns the `+` signs.

The correct answer, D, aligns best with StackExchange's gold badge philosophy for several reasons:\n\n1. Rarity: Gold badges are described as \"rare\" in the documentation. The \"Reversal\" badge represents an uncommon scenario where a highly downvoted question receives a well-received answer.\n\n2. Skill and knowledge: The badge requires providing a high-quality answer (+20 score) to a challenging or initially unpopular question, demonstrating both skill and knowledge.\n\n3. Not self-achievable: Unlike options A and C, which could be achieved through consistent individual effort, the \"Reversal\" badge requires a specific combination of community reactions (downvotes on the question, upvotes on the answer).\n\n4. Luck + Skill: The documentation categorizes badges like this under \"Luck + (some degree of) Skill,\" which fits the \"Reversal\" badge perfectly.\n\n5. Real-world parallel: This badge directly mirrors StackExchange's actual \"Reversal\" gold badge.\n\nOption A is too easily self-achievable and doesn't represent rarity. Option B is similar to the \"Famous Question\" badge but sets an unrealistically high bar. Option C is similar to the \"Fanatic\" badge but extends it to an extreme that loses the balance of skill and dedication.

After implementing the widget, they notice that the WYSIWYG editor for the custom content is not rendering properly in the admin panel. Which of the following is the most likely cause and solution to this issue?\n\nA) The `widget.xml` file is missing the `xsi:type=\"block\"` attribute for the custom content parameter. Add this attribute to enable the WYSIWYG editor.\n\nB) The `Editor.php` block class is not implementing the `BlockInterface`. Modify the class to implement this interface to enable proper rendering.\n\nC) The `prepareElementHtml()` method in `Editor.php` is not correctly configuring the WYSIWYG editor. Adjust the method to use the correct configuration options.\n\nD) The `_getAfterElementHtml()` method is hiding the control value with CSS. Remove or modify this method to allow the WYSIWYG editor to display properly.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the WYSIWYG editor not rendering properly is likely the CSS applied in the `_getAfterElementHtml()` method of the `Editor.php` class. This method adds inline CSS that hides elements with the class `.admin__field-control.control .control-value` by setting `display: none !important;`. \n\nThis is problematic because:\n\n1. The WYSIWYG editor typically renders within elements that may have these classes, causing it to be hidden.\n2. The use of `!important` makes it difficult to override this style elsewhere.\n\nTo solve this issue, the developer should either remove the `_getAfterElementHtml()` method entirely if it's not needed, or modify the CSS to be more specific and avoid hiding the WYSIWYG editor components. \n\nThis question requires the candidate to:\n1. Analyze the provided code and identify potential issues (L4 - Analyze in Bloom's taxonomy)\n2. Understand the interaction between different components of a Magento 2 widget (L3 - Apply)\n3. Recognize the impact of CSS on admin panel rendering (L4 - Analyze)\n4. Apply knowledge of Magento 2 admin interface structure (L3 - Apply)\n\nThe distractors (A, B, and C) represent plausible issues that a developer might consider, but are not the actual cause of the problem described in the question.

Suppose we know just the initial coordinates of a system i.e. $q\\_i(t\\_1\\)$ and not its final coordinates. How can we find out the path followed by the system using the least\\-action principle (Hamilton's Principle)? As it seems to me that it can only be used when both end points are known.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a subtle point. In principle, $q(t\\_2\\)$ (as well as $q(t\\_1\\)$) is indeed held fixed at its unknown final value. However, in practice, to a apply Hamilton's principle you don't actually directly fix those path endpoints and calculate any actions, as you might expect you would.\n\nIn practice (for classical systems \\- things are different in quantum mechanics), you always solve the general problem first, by ignoring your initial condition and requiring that the action be stationary for *arbitrary* fixed initial and final positions. (By \"arbitrary fixed\", which may sound contradictory, I mean that you are requiring the action to be stationary over the space of trajectories with fixed endpoints, but you're separately solving the problem for all possible choices of fixed endpoints, rather than just solving it for a single specific choice of endpoints.)\n\nThis gives you the Euler\\-Lagrange equation, when turns out to be *independent* of those endpoints. Then you forget about the action entirely and just work directly with the Euler\\-Lagrange equation, which is a differential equation that can be tackled as an initial\\-value problem. In practice, this second step ends up being completely independent from the initial step of varying the action \\- the action formalism gets you the E\\-L equation, but then you can forget about it and jump directly to the E\\-L equation.\n\nSo it's this weird conceptual two\\-step, where you hold the trajectory endpoint fixed to an *unknown* variable (literally just the dummy variable \"$q(t\\_2\\)$\", with no fixed value assigned). Since the value of $q(t\\_2\\)$ ends up not entering into the differential equation that pops out, you don't actually need to know it ahead of time."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Hamilton's principle and the least-action principle, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is studying a complex mechanical system with multiple degrees of freedom.

The correct approach, as explained in the documentation, is to use the Euler-Lagrange equation as an initial-value problem (option B).\n\nThe key insights are:\n1. While Hamilton's principle technically requires fixed endpoints, in practice, we don't directly minimize the action integral for unknown final positions.\n2. Instead, we first derive the Euler-Lagrange equation by requiring the action to be stationary for arbitrary fixed endpoints.\n3. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is independent of the specific endpoint values.\n4. We can then use this equation as a differential equation and solve it as an initial-value problem, using only the known initial conditions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because directly minimizing the action integral for all possible final positions would be computationally infeasible and isn't the standard approach.\n\nOption C, using numerical methods to iterate through all trajectories, is also impractical and misses the analytical power of the Euler-Lagrange formulation.\n\nOption D misunderstands the process - while we conceptually consider arbitrary fixed endpoints to derive the Euler-Lagrange equation, we don't actually solve for each set independently.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (action principle, Euler-Lagrange equations, initial-value problems) and tests the ability to apply theoretical principles to a practical problem-solving scenario."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/04", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/115891", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/24490/"], "docs_id": 115891, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking to minimize how much my wall\\-mounted TV protrudes out of the wall by recessing the wall plate of the mount.

It's considered \"dense\". Other softer species have lower strength values...some as much as 40% less.\n\n2\\) Moisture Content: Green lumber (unseasoned) will not tend to split as much as \"dry\" or \"surface dry\" lumber. Assuming your wall has been built and has been in a dry environment for more than a year, it should not split, even when you \"shave it\" (as you call it). Also, I'm going to assume the fasteners will be more than 7 times their diameter so they won't split the wood. \n\n3\\) Diameter: Because the fastener needs to fit within the stud WIDTH, the diameter is limited to the minimum edge distance of 4 times the diameter...and that assumes you'll be equal distance from each edge of the stud. \n\n4\\) Depth: Assuming a minimum of about 1 1/2\" into wood, the screw needs to be about 2 1/2\" long to account for the 1/2\" drywall plus thickness of the metal hanger. \n\n5\\) Screw or Bolt: You said screw so I'll use screw. \n\n6\\) Loading: Fastening into stud will be side grain (not end grain, which is about 75% less). Also, because the TV is hanging on the wall, loading is a combination of shear and withdrawal. \n\nTherefore, I'd use a \\#8 wood screw (0\\.164\" diameter) x 2 1/2\" long (to develop full resistance) which will give you about 95 lbs. withdrawal resistance in close or medium grain \"dry\" lumber per screw. \n\nRemember, you can only \"shave\" a maximum of 1 1/2\" off depth of stud (don't over cut or it will weaken stud) and don't over pre\\-drill diameter of hole. To develop full lateral strength, there needs to be lead holes drilled (pre\\-drilled). Lead holes should be about 7/8th the shank diameter. Therefore, I'd use a 0\\.1435\" diameter bit.

Which of the following approaches would best ensure both a secure mount and minimal structural impact on the wall?\n\nA) Use 1.5-inch screws and shave the studs to a depth of 1.75 inches\nB) Use 2.5-inch #8 wood screws, pre-drill with a 1/8-inch bit, and shave no more than 1.5 inches off the stud depth\nC) Use 3-inch lag bolts without pre-drilling and shave 2 inches off the stud depth\nD) Use 2-inch screws, apply soap for easier installation, and shave 2.25 inches off the stud depth\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer (B) integrates several key points:\n\n1. Screw length: The expert recommends 2.5-inch screws to account for 1.5 inches into the wood, plus 0.5 inches for drywall and the thickness of the mount.\n2. Screw type and size: #8 wood screws are specifically recommended for this application.\n3. Pre-drilling: The expert advises pre-drilling with a bit that's 7/8 the shank diameter, which for a #8 screw is approximately 1/8 inch.\n4. Stud modification: The maximum safe depth to shave off a stud is 1.5 inches, to avoid weakening the structure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 1.5-inch screws are too short to provide adequate support, and 1.75 inches is too deep to shave the studs safely. Option C is incorrect because lag bolts are not recommended, pre-drilling is advised, and 2 inches is too deep to shave the studs. Option D is incorrect because 2-inch screws are too short, and 2.25 inches is far too deep to shave the studs safely, though it correctly mentions using soap to ease installation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple aspects of the mounting process, considering both the immediate goal (minimizing protrusion) and the critical safety and structural considerations involved in properly mounting a heavy object on a wall."}}
