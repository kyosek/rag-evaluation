Now consider a symmetric $n\\\\times n$ matrix $M$ with integer entries which can be written as $M\\= Q^{\\\\rm T} Q$ for an $m \\\\times n$ matrix $Q$ with integer entries.

What is the smallest possible such constant (perhaps even linear growth?)?\n\nIf we look at the same situation over the polynomial ring $\\\\mathbb{R}\\[T]$ in one variable, we have the following: Every sum of squares in $\\\\mathbb{R}\\[T]$ is a sum of two squares and one can show that $c(n)$ grows linearly in $n$: $c(n)\\=2n$. Thus, I hope that a similar result might hold over the integers too. Perhaps $c(n)$ even grows linearly in $n$?\n\nIs someone aware of something in that direction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an answer (see the last point). It differs from what I had been claiming in my first post. There I was saying that any positive bilinear module $\\\\Lambda$ over $\\\\mathbf Z\\[\\\\frac 12]$ was representable by some euclidean module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Z\\[\\\\frac 12]$. This is true (with $n\\\\leq \\\\text{rk}(\\\\Lambda)\\+3$), but is of no use in our situation. \n\nNevertheless the same technics show that any positive bilinear $m$\\-dimensional module over $\\\\mathbf Z$ is representable by somebody in the same genus than the euclidean module of rank $m\\+4$. This is proved here in the third point, since it might be of interest.\n\nIn terms of matrices, as in the OP, it says that for any symmetric positive definite matrix $M\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_m(\\\\mathbf Z)$ there exists a symmetric positive definite matrix $G\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_{m\\+4}(\\\\mathbf Z)$ with determinant $1$ and at least one odd diagonal entry, and a matrix $Q\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Mat}\\_{m\\+4,m}(\\\\mathbf Z)$ such that the following holds :\n$$Q^t.G.Q\\=M\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ .$$\n\nLet $M$ be a positive definite symmetric $m\\\\times m$ matrix. Let $\\\\mathrm{M}$ be the bilinear module $(\\\\mathbf{Z}^m,M)$. The question can be rephrased :\n\nWhat is the smallest value $n$ such that the standard euclidean bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ represents $\\\\mathrm{M}$. \n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ First note that in general, such an $n$ doesn't exist. Indeed, a positive definite integral lattice decomposes as the orthogonal sum of indecomposable (for the orthogonal direct sum) lattices in a unique manner. In particular, the only unimodular (i.e. $\\\\det(M)\\=1$) lattice $\\\\mathrm{M}$ represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ are isomorphic to $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_m$. \n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Over $\\\\mathbf Q$, the space $\\\\mathrm{M}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q$ for some $n\\\\leq m\\+3$. This follows from the Hasse principle (that implies that a rank $4$ positive definite space represents $1$), Witt cancellation, and the fact that, for example, $(\\\\mathrm{M}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q)^{\\\\perp 4}$ is euclidean, as a computation of Hasse\\-Minkowski symbols shows.\n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ It follows that over $\\\\mathbf Z$, any bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by some bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{N}$ lying in the genus of $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n}$, for some $n\\\\leq m\\+4$ (the addition of a one dimensional module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_1$ might be necessary when $m\\+3$ is a multiple of $8$, in order to ensure that $\\\\mathrm{N}$ is odd).\n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Finally, here is an answer to the question. Let $M$ be an $m$\\-dimensional submodule of $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$. Let $P$ be its orthogonal. Let $\\\\pi : \\\\mathrm{I}\\_n\\\\otimes Q\\\\to M\\\\otimes Q$ be the orthogonal projection. Then $\\\\pi(\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n)$ is contained in $M^\\\\sharp$ (the dual lattice of $M$ in $M\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf Q$), and there exists a smallest $d$ such that $M^\\\\sharp\\\\subset d^{\\-1}M$. Let $S$ be the sphere of unitary vectors in $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$. Then the vectors of $d.\\\\pi(S)\\\\subset M$ have squared length smaller than $d^2$. If the number of such vectors is smaller than $\\\\mathrm{card}(S)\\=2^n$, this means that a vector of squared length $2$ in $I\\_n$ lies in $P$, so $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is in fact represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-2}\\\\perp \\<2\\>$. If once again the same phenomenon occurs, then $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is in fact represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-4}\\\\perp \\<2,2\\>$ which is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-2}$. So what we get is :\n\nLet $d$ be the smallest integer such that $\\\\mathrm{M}^\\\\sharp\\\\subset \\\\frac 1d\\\\mathrm{M}$. Let $B\\_d(\\\\mathrm{M})$ denote the number of non\\-trivial vectors of $M$ in the ball of radius $d$. Let $n\\_0$ be the floor of $2\\+\\\\log\\_2(B\\_d(\\\\mathrm{M}))$. If $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ for some $n$, then $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\_0}$.\n\nI hope there are better bounds, but I cannot see how to get them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a symmetric n\u00d7n matrix M with integer entries that can be written as M = Q^T Q for an m\u00d7n matrix Q with integer entries.

The Thevenin equivalent voltage is V = J * R1 = 2A * 1\u03a9 = 2V.\n2. For maximum power transfer, the impedance seen by RN should be 100\u03a9. The transformer needs to convert 1\u03a9 to 25\u03a9 (because 25\u03a9 + R2 = 100\u03a9). The turns ratio n is the square root of the impedance ratio: n = \u221a(25/1) = 5.\n3. The maximum power transferred is (V/2)^2 / RN = (2/2)^2 / 100 = 0.5W.\n4. With n = 4, the impedance seen by RN is 75\u03a9 + (1\u03a9 * 4^2) = 91\u03a9.

So we've to intercept the mail before they arrive to the external SMTP.\nFor this, we've configured a local Postfix to substitute to the external SMTP. It have to accept mails, change the sender (the new one will be in the Subject between some special chars) and re\\-route the mail to the official external SMTP. All mails have attachments (doc/pdf file).\nIs there any direct commands/method to do this?\n\nAt high level, the solution I thinked about is based on: \nhold the queue, postcat the messages, change the sender by a script, send the mail by mail/mailx command..\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Presumably you want to change the envelope sender address as well as the \"From:\" address in the email headers?\n\nThe first part is easy \\- it's basically [generic address mapping for outgoing SMTP mail](http://www.postfix.org/ADDRESS_REWRITING_README.html#generic)\n\nYou need to define a generic address map in `main.cf` and then create the actual address map file with the address conversion(s) you need.\n\n```\n /etc/postfix/main.cf:\n    smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic\n\n/etc/postfix/generic:\n    noreply@localdomain.local        email@example.com\n\n```\n\nTo modify the email header \"From:\" as well, you need a [header check](http://www.postfix.org/header_checks.5.html) ([http://www.postfix.org/header\\_checks.5\\.html](http://www.postfix.org/header_checks.5.html)).

The PCRE map is a regex format, so you can use one to match the text you need to replace (rather than the exact text) \\- in the example, it'll match a From: field that contains the \"bad\" sender address (plus any other text in that field), and replace the whole field with the new text.\n\n```\n/etc/postfix/main.cf:\n    header_checks = pcre:/etc/postfix/header_checks.pcre\n\n/etc/postfix/header_checks: \n    /^From:.*noreply@localdomain\\.local.*/ REPLACE From: \"Some Name\" <email@example.com>\n\n```\n\nRemember to `postmap` any new map files you create!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are managing a legacy web application that sends emails through an external SMTP server.

There are two ways to do this.\n\n1\\) Integrate with respect to $x$ first, then $y$. In this case, when integrating with respect to $x$, you assume you are at some fixed $y$ value. Then (using a sketch of the graph) you integrate with respect to $x$ starting at $0$ and finishing at $1\\-y$. Now you integrate with respect to $y$ from $0$ to $1$. So you'd get $$\\\\int\\_0^1\\\\int\\_0^{1\\-y} xy\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx\\\\,\\\\mathrm dy$$\n\n2\\) Integrate with respect to $y$ first, then $x$.

If so, how do I resolve this?\n\n```\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Courier New\";\n  src: url(/fonts/cour.ttf) format('truetype');\n}\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legal questions should be answered by a lawyer. The question of licensing, however, can be addressed.\n\nTo\u00a0answer this properly, we need to look at the intellectual property holdings around both fonts \\- copyright, trademark and possibly design patent. Realize that all of this comes from my layman's understanding of IP law (that I have delved into some, but I'm still not a lawyer).\n\nAs a preface, I'm assuming that `curr.ttf` is the true type font for Courier and **not** Courier New (those tend to be named `courier new.ttf` or something to that effect \\- it is important for IP that it be named properly (if the IP holders of Courier New started naming their font file Courier instead, things become hazy)).\n\nIf, you are willing to accept wikipedia as a source of some legal information \\- from [Courier typeface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface))\n\n> Although the design of the original Courier typeface was commissioned by IBM, the company deliberately chose not to secure legal exclusivity to the typeface and it soon became a standard font used throughout the typewriter industry. Since IBM deliberately chose not to seek any copyright, trademark, or design patent protection, the Courier typeface cannot now be trademarked or copyrighted and is completely royalty free.\n\nThis information can be found in multiple locations (not just Wikipedia). One can find a more recent release of the Courier typeface at [http://www.ctan.org/tex\\-archive/fonts/psfonts/courier](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/courier) which includes the IBM/MIT X Consortium Courier Typefont agreement which reads:\n\n> You are hereby granted permission under the terms of the IBM/MIT X Consortium\n>  Courier Typefont agreement to execute, reproduce, distribute, display, market,\n>  sell and otherwise transfer copies of the IBM Courier font to third parties.\n\nThe legal bit on the 'Courier' *name* is the trademark \\- not copyright or patent (its the [trademark dilution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution) that one would be concerned with). As stated, there is deliberately no trademark protection on the Courier name (which has allowed other companies to use it as the basis for their font names \\- such as 'Courier New'. Compare with [Helvetica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) which is a registered trademark of Linotype\\-Hell, and thus when Macintosh was implementing screen fonts couldn't use that name as its basis so named the corresponding font [Geneva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_(typeface) \"Geneva is the capital of Switzerland, the Latin name for which is Helvetica\") \\- note the bitmap version of the font was not protected while the *name* Helvatica was.. and Apple likely had good lawyers for anyt that wanted to discuss that).\n\n(There is much more about this if one wants to delve into the realm of copyright law (and intellectual property) on typefaces \\- which varies by country. In the US it has been established several times that typefaces are not protected by copyright. The copyright protection declined on Courier mentioned above would have been on the wheel and hammers in the typewriter, this wasn't sought after. Design patents can also protect fonts (such as the Cocacola font) \\- this wasn't done. Furthermore, the name of the font can be protected by trademark \\- this wasn't done. Note that all of this pertains to Courier font, not others where there may be trademarks on it. The actual implementation of a font *can* be protected (the `cour.ttf` file), but one *may* be able to reimplement the font from scratch and not infringe upon copyright... though all of this gets murky if one is in the US and the font designer is in the UK (where one can copyright a typeface) \\- in which case talk to a lawyer again.)\n\nOn the other hand... 'Courier New' name from [Microsoft Typography Courier New \\- Version 5\\.10](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1735) shows a \"Courier New is a trademark of The Monotype Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.\"\n\n**You would likely be better off defining the Courier font name rather than Courier New**. 'Courier' won't raise the ire of IBM, 'Courier New' might raise the ire of The Monotype Corporation and given that this is their business, they likely do care. Defining the Courier New font family using the Courier true type font dilutes The Monotype Corporation's trademark and something that becomes an issue.\n\n**If one wants to instead license the font Courier New...**  \n\nAs has been pointed out in comments, following the link on the Microsoft Typography for licensing page takes you to [fonts.com web fonts](http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts) which has (I haven't delved into it) various licensing for the fonts for defining a font face (the lowest tier has 25k pageviews/30 days for free though you need a badge on the page \\- the next tier is $10/month and 250k pageviews/30 days with no badge on the page).

I think it's really cool that we can partition a set using equivalence relations. I'm also someone who doesn't do math for its applications but for its beauty. However...\n\n> **Why do we care about equivalence relations?**\n\nFor a specific equivalence relation reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity are always immediate (at least from what I have seen). You can e.g. define modulo with equivalence relations. Suppose you have never even heard of the equivalence relations, though. You could still define modulo without a problem.\n\nExample: Just today, we've defined connected components of a graph [using equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)) in class. Why would you want to do that? Why not use standard graph theory language? I don't see the reason for using equivalence relations to introduce connected components \\- what exactly is it that we gain by introducing equivalence classes?\n\nSo in summary, I kind of lack a **motivation** for equivalence relations and would appreciate examples that could enlighten me on that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the context of the connected components of a graph, the idea isn't very interesting, because the picture for connected components of a graph is already so clear and easy to understand geometrically.\n\nBut one of the principal techniques of mathematics is to find the underlying structure in one context, and then try to make an abstract model of it that might apply in other contexts as well. By doing this, we understand the connections between the two contexts, and we can sometimes solve difficult problems in one context by applying tools imported from some other context.\n\nWe don't formulate the idea of a partition or an equivalence relation because we want to study the connected components of graphs. For that it's unnecessary, because graph components are simple.\n\nBut that simplicity makes graph theory a good place to start understanding the idea of an equivalence relation, so that when you happen across it in a different context, where it might be more useful, you can recognize it and say \u201coh, we can model this with an equivalence relation, which means that it partitions the structure into components, and I already know some theorems about how that will work and some techniques I can use.\u201d\n\nAnd you have a language for talking about these things, which can be applied in many different situations, so that when you say \u201cconsider the equivalence classes of (something) under (some relation)\u201d you and the people you are talking to instantly get an idea of what is going on: these classes are disjoint, every object is in exactly one class, and so on, just like the components of a graph.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n1. What are fractions? They are notations of the form $\\\\frac ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b$ is not zero. What are the rational numbers? Just fractions? No, they are the equivalence classes of fractions under the relation that says $\\\\frac ab \\\\equiv \\\\frac cd$ if $ad\\=bc$, because for example $\\\\frac 36$ and $\\\\frac8{16}$ are the same rational number. Okay, big deal, we already know all about rational numbers. But having identified the process, we can now apply it to all sorts of things more complicated than the integers. Can we do the same construction for, say, polynomials? (We can!) Are the results useful and interesting? (They are!)\n2. We can relate the complex numbers to polynomials by defining each complex number as a part of a partition induced on the set of polynomials by a certain equivalence relation. By using different equivalence relations we can define different systems analogous to the complex numbers and use them to study properties of polynomials.\n3. Mathematics has a structure called a group, which is a model of a way in which a thing can have symmetry. There is an important \u201cquotient\u201d operation on a group which arises when you consider certain symmetries to be \u201cequivalent\u201d; the quotient is a group that describes the symmetries of the resulting equivalence classes.\n4. This is a very specific example: Consider some geometric object which has an *even* number of symmetries. Then the object must have at least one symmetry which is an \u201cinvolution\u201d: this means that if you perform the symmetry exactly twice, the object is back in its original position. Objects without involutions must have an odd number of symmetries! (An example is a table\\-saw blade with 37 teeth.) I hope this is not obvious! But it is very easy to show if you consider the right equivalence relation on the symmetries.\n5. An important technique in physics is to analyze the symmetries of the universe itself. For example, the laws of conservation of momentum and energy are consequences of certain symmetries of space\\-time. The abstract structure of spaces with these symmetries is often best understood as a particular quotient group.\n6. This \u201cquotient\u201d idea applies in other situations too. Many kinds of mathematical structures are best understood as quotients, in this sense. For example, in topology we often view a circle as being a quotient of a line segment, under the equivalence relation that says that the two endpoints are equivalent. When we want to deal with a M\u00f6bius strip, we often formulate it as a certain quotient of a rectangle, where the equivalence relation makes certain points on the edge of the rectangle equivalent. Many related objects, much weirder than the M\u00f6bius strip, can be dealt with similarly.\n\nWe don't study the identification between partitions and equivalence relations just because it is cool. It is also useful in understanding other things. Partitions and equivalence relations pop up everywhere. Sometimes the partition is obvious, but the equivalence relation is easier to understand; then it is helpful to reinterpret the partition as an equivalence relation. Sometimes it is useful to go in the other direction instead."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a group G and a normal subgroup H of G.

This question tests understanding of quotient groups and their relationship to equivalence relations and partitions.\n\nA) This is correct. The quotient group G/H is formed by partitioning G into left (or right) cosets of H. These cosets form equivalence classes under the relation a ~ b if ab^(-1) \u2208 H. The group operation on G/H is then defined in terms of these cosets.\n\nB) This is incorrect.

Every few seconds the ATTiny85 a signal out of PWM0 so that it can make the motor (Denoted by M) run. I understand most of the circuit except the one on the upper right.

You can try setting a desired training error **e** and a maximum number of epochs **n**.

You train with 9 folders, and test with the other one.\n\nI think you might be confused about training and test error.

data in QGIS and want to style it correctly. Which combination of post-processing steps and QGIS techniques would you use to achieve this?\n\nA) Import the data as GML, use QGIS field calculator to create new columns, and apply SLD files directly without modification.\n\nB) Load data into a PostGIS database, run SQL scripts to add new columns like 'anchor', 'fontcolour', and 'fontname', then use data-driven styling in QGIS.\n\nC) Convert data to shapefiles, manually add new columns in QGIS, and use the QGIS style manager to create rules based on existing attributes.\n\nD) Use a proprietary loader to import the data, apply pre-made style files, and adjust the symbology manually in QGIS.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach involves loading the data into a PostGIS database and running SQL scripts to add necessary columns for styling. This method allows for efficient data management and preparation. The added columns like 'anchor', 'fontcolour', and 'fontname' are crucial for applying the correct styles in QGIS.

From description it look like the NAND one (/S, /R) would be suitable in this situation. You should be able to find a chip with such latch or build one from gates using for example 74HC00 (4 nand gates out of which 2 would be used). However one extra pin to reset the SR latch after power up caused by the external button is needed.\n\nConnection could be as follows:\n\n* /S \\- connected to wake up button connected also to ESP8266\\. Assumed the ESP8266 wake up (/RESET) is active low, momentary switch pulls to GND, and this line is normally pulled up (like in the falstad schematic from question).\n* /R \\- connected to some output of the ESP8266 (GPIO) \\- you would need pull up on this pin too, so it is defined when ESP8266 is in power down\n* Q (SR output) \\- connected to some input of the ESP8266 (GPIO)\n\nOperation would be as follows:\n\n1. Pressing the momentary switch (shorting to GND) \\- would change state of the SR output to 1\\.\n2. After boot up is finished software would read state of the Q \\- if it is \"1\" this is power up due to switch/if 0 this is power up due to timer.\n3. Before going to sleep again, you would arm the SR latch for next power up by applying short pulse to GND on /R pin so Q would be 0\\.\n\nOne drawback of this solution is that after first applying power to the system (3\\.3V ramp up) SR latch state is unknown (either 0 or 1\\). This means that you might misread first power up reason but later on would be OK.\n\n*Standard disclaimer \\- solution provided w/o any simulation or prototyping \\- you should think it through, check if works at all and if is suitable for your application.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An ESP8266 module is programmed to wake up every 6 hours to read a humidity sensor and post data to IFTTT.

I train up my classifier, and get the following confusion matrix:\n\n```\n\n+---+-----+-----+\n|   |  S  |  B  |\n+---+-----+-----+\n| S | 0.9 | 0.1 |\n| B | 0.2 | 0.8 |\n+---+-----+-----+\n\n```\n\nThat is, 90% of signal is correctly identified and 80% of background.\n\nNow, I give my classifier a set of testing data with a 20/80 S/B split, and this classifier tells me that my data consists of\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0\\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.9 \\& 0\\.2 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.1 \\& 0\\.8 \\\\end{pmatrix}\n\\\\begin{pmatrix} S \\\\\\\\ B \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.34 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.66 \\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\nNot super great.\n\nImprovement \\#1\n---------------\n\nI think I am allowed to use my knowledge of the category leakage (expressed in the confusion matrix) in order to correct my population estimates. I.e.,\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_1 \\\\\\\\ B\\_1\\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.9 \\& 0\\.2 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.1 \\& 0\\.8 \\\\end{pmatrix}^{\\-1}\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0\\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\nwhich in this case gives back the input signal and background perfectly. In a real case of course the mismatch won't be exactly the same as the confusion matrix on the training data, but **it must still be better than taking the numbers at face value, right?**\n\nImprovement \\#2\n---------------\n\nLet's say I modify my classifier so that, for a given input sample, if the classification probability is below some threshold (e.g. 10%), classify as \"Uknown\". Now I have a new confusion matrix:\n\n```\n\n+---+------+------+------+\n|   |  S   |  B   |  U   |\n+---+------+------+------+\n| S | 0.9  | 0.02 | 0.08 |\n| B | 0.05 | 0.75 | 0.2  |\n+---+------+------+------+\n\n```\n\nand when I give it the same 20/80 split, I get\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\.22 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.604 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.176\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow to estimate the true signal and background fractions, I could perform e.g. a $\\\\chi^2$ minimization of the different weights in the confusion matrix to my test output. I.e. minimize $\\|\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}\\|^2$ in\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\mathbf{M\\_c} \\\\begin{pmatrix} S\\_1 \\\\\\\\ B\\_1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\vec{\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}}\n$$\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{M\\_c}$ is the confusion matrix (transposed).\n\nImprovement \\#3\n---------------\n\nFor any sample I give to the classifier, I get a score that tells me the probability that the sample is signal. Using my training data (or better, a different, independent set of training data), I can build PDFs for the score distribution separately for signal and background events. When I want to evaluate a test dataset, I get the distribution of scores from the classifier and fit that to the weighted sum of my signal and background PDFs, and the resulting weights give me the fraction of signal and background in the test dataset.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIs this sort of approach standard, and where can I find more information?  \n\nIf it's not already standard, are these approaches valid, and likely to add anything useful in a real\\-world scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The fact that your first graph merely oscillates between two values suggests to me that you are resetting the prior each time you perform an iteration. So what you are seeing in the graph is a sequence of posteriors, each of which only take one data point into account. That is not the correct method for iterative Bayesian updating. Remember that when you do iterative Bayesian updating, the prior for each new iteration is the *posterior* from the last iteration. So your algorithm should be:\n\n> **Iterative Bayesian updating:** Start with the prior mass function:\n> \n> \n> $$\\\\pi\\_0(\\\\theta) \\= \\\\frac{1}{11} \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } \\\\theta \\= \\\\tfrac{0}{10}, \\\\tfrac{1}{10}, ..., \\\\tfrac{10}{10}.$$\n> \n> \n> For $i\\=1,...,n$ and $x\\_i \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}$, update your beliefs via the iteration:\n> \n> \n> $$\\\\pi\\_i(\\\\theta) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\theta^{x\\_i} (1\\-\\\\theta)^{1\\-x\\_i} \\\\pi\\_{i\\-1}(\\\\theta)}{\\\\sum\\_\\\\theta \\\\theta^{x\\_i} (1\\-\\\\theta)^{1\\-x\\_i} \\\\pi\\_{i\\-1} (\\\\theta)}$$ \n> \n> \n> Notice that in each iteration the prior $\\\\pi\\_{i\\-1}$ is the posterior from the previous iteration. The mass function $\\\\pi\\_n$ is the posterior after incorporating all the data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is performing iterative Bayesian updating on a dataset of binary outcomes.
