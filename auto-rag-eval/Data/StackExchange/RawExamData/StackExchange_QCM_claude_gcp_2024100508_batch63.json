I live in eastern Massachusetts where it has recently been in the teens and 20s for low temps in winter.\nI have a large crawl space under my kitchen and 3 season porch ranging in height from 1' to 4' with no venting to the outside. I recently air\\-sealed the entire rim joist with an expanding foam and added a heavy mil plastic sheeting over the dirt floor, making sure to overlap and seal all edges. We also insulated the copper pipes in the space with closed cell insulation tubing and taped all joints to prevent the pipes from freezing. The kitchen is still very cold.  \n\nI would like to ideally insulate the space in between the floor joists and possibly the exterior brick foundation walls but are getting conflicting info on what to do. \n\n* Could use a poly spray foam kit, but the max R\\-values I have seen are only in the 7\\-10 range and its not anywhere close to warm enough outside to prevent it from failing. Everything I read says not to use apply when below 60 degrees or it will not cure properly. Its barely in the 30s right now! Also, the exterior walls are not all that clean and the foam might not stick.\n* Floor joists are not evenly spaced and range from 17\"OC to 22\"OC so batt insulation is going to be a pain.\n* Could use blown\\-in insulation but how do I get it to stay up there? Someone told me to use a plastic sheeting across all the joists with furring strips for extra support and then simply blow the insulation into each joist cavity, but I am worried that the plastic sheeting is too much of a vapor barrier and will cause mold inside the joist cavities. If the crawl space is already moisture sealed, am I OK? Do I need some sort of barrier up inside the cavities on the bottom of the floor?\n\nAlso, do I really need to insulate the brick foundation walls and will this show a big difference? Because the dirt is not evenly distributed and some areas are tight to get into, getting rigid foam board would be nearly impossible. \n\nPlease help!!!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am also in the Northeast and have had to tackle this type of situation a few times. There are several ways to attack it. \n\nIn your case, the best solution, but unfortunately the most expensive would be to use an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays. They are fairly easy to use and give you about an R\\-4 rating per inch. They are a two tank kit with a hose and wand.\n Here is an example product: [Touch N Seal 1000 Kit Open Cell Spray Foam Insulation](http://www.betterenergystore.com/productpage.asp?p=624&gclid=COb_3t_VnLUCFcuZ4Aod1BkAIw)\n\nThese type of kits start around $400, depending on the square footage and depth required.\n\nA cheaper method would be to use 24 inch R\\-19 unfaced blanket insulation cut to your custom widths. You can use wire springs to hold it in place and keep it from falling. I would then cover the entire area with 4 to 6 mil plastic, stapled to all the joists. Tape the joints, if any. Moisture should not be a major problem since you have already done what sounds like a good job sealing the dirt floor. In the summer months, some ventilation in the crawl space will also help avoid excess moisture.\n\nRigid foam glued to the foundation walls would also help if the area is fairly air tight. If there is free air flow, insulating the brick walls would be a waste of time and money."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When insulating a crawl space in a cold climate like Massachusetts, which of the following methods is recommended as the best solution according to the expert, despite being the most expensive?\n\nA) Using R-19 unfaced blanket insulation cut to custom widths and held in place with wire springs\nB) Applying a poly spray foam kit with R-values between 7-10\nC) Using an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays, providing about R-4 per inch\nD) Using blown-in insulation with plastic sheeting across the joists for support\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert states that \"the best solution, but unfortunately the most expensive would be to use an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays.\" They mention it provides about R-4 rating per inch and is fairly easy to use, despite the higher cost.

By overwriting the resource model's save() method and adding logging statements throughout, you can track the execution flow and identify where the process is failing or deviating from the expected behavior. This method allows for a granular examination of the save process, including checking conditions for non-increment primary keys and other potential issues.\n\nOption A is a basic debugging step but doesn't provide enough detail to diagnose complex issues within the save() method.\nOption B is incorrect as $transaction->getLastError() is not a standard Magento method and won't provide the necessary debugging information.\nOption D might help identify some PHP-level issues but won't specifically target the Magento save() method's internal workings.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows developers to understand the code flow, log at each condition, and pinpoint exactly where the save process might be failing or not executing as expected, even when no apparent errors are thrown."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/25", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/44172127", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/7977797/"], "docs_id": 44172127, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So, basically, I have a program that forks off a child process and creates a directory with the name \\+ the child processes ID.

I use `SAS PROC LOGISTIC` and I am using the output probabilities to classify each observation in to a specific category depending on which probability of the 18 probabilities output by SAS is the maximum. For example, if p10 is the highest probability of all 18 probabilities, then, I classify this observation in to category 10\\. Just to double check, I also use the estimates output by `proc logistic` and do explicit logistic calculations as follows: \n\n```\ncum prob, c1 = exp(&inter1 - modelScore)/(1 + exp(&inter1 - modelScore))\n...\ncum prob, c17 = exp(&inter17 - modelScore)/(1 + exp(&inter17 - modelScore)); \n\n```\n\nand calculate the individual probabilities p1 to p18 with `p1 = c1`, `p2 = c2 - p1`, and `p18 = 1 - c17`.\n\nThe problem is, the categories (2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 18\\) are never occurring in the predicted response.

So when some classes are not predicted that is simply because the model never gave them maximum probability. That might just be correct, and not necessary a reason for concern. So I disagree with the answer by @Nitin, proposing oversampling.\n\nYou might say: *but they did occur in the data*. Yes, but it might have been rare occurrences! never really the most probable outcome given the predictors in the model. You didn't give us a context, what your classes represent in the \"real world\". You have very unbalanced classes. That might be because some classes really are uncommon in your population, or it might be some problems with data collection. You didn't tell us. But it is difficult to see that over (or under)\\-sampling can achieve anything that cannot be achieved using weights. \n\nEven more important, you are using (ordinal) logistic regression, which is **not** a classifier, see [Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/127042/why-isnt-logistic-regression-called-logistic-classification). Logistic regression gives you estimated probabilities for class membership, and instead of just looking at the maximum predicted probability, you could compare the predicted probabilities with the population proportions. Or even pass to use some *proper scoring rule*. See [Using proper scoring rule to determine class membership from logistic regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/109851/using-proper-scoring-rule-to-determine-class-membership-from-logistic-regression) or [Is accuracy an improper scoring rule in a binary classification setting?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/359909/is-accuracy-an-improper-scoring-rule-in-a-binary-classification-setting). \n\nAbout the use of over/under\\-sampling, our community member @Frank Harrell have on this site (and elsewhere) commented against its use, see [Downsampling vs upsampling on the significance of the predictors in logistic regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/199230/downsampling-vs-upsampling-on-the-significance-of-the-predictors-in-logistic-reg) and [https://www.fharrell.com/post/class\\-damage/](https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An analyst runs an ordinal logistic regression model with 18 categories for the response variable (Y = 2, 3, 4, ..., 19).

As explained in the documentation, when some classes are not predicted, it's because the model never gave them maximum probability. This doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the model. It could simply mean that these categories, while present in the original data, are rare occurrences or never the most probable outcome given the predictors in the model.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the absence of certain categories in the predictions doesn't automatically mean the model is wrong.\n\nAnswer C is not recommended. The documentation specifically argues against oversampling, stating that it's difficult to see how over- or under-sampling can achieve anything that cannot be achieved using weights.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because ordinal logistic regression can be appropriate for this type of data. The issue is not with the method itself, but with the interpretation of its results.\n\nThe key point is that logistic regression provides estimated probabilities for class membership, and looking only at the maximum predicted probability might not give the full picture.

That was my answer till this afternoon! \"Mathematics without proofs isn't really mathematics at all\" probably was my longer answer. Yet, I am a mathematics educator who was one of the panelists of a discussion on \"proof\" this afternoon, alongside two of my mathematician colleagues, and in front of about 100 people, mostly mathematicians, or students of mathematics. What I was hearing was \"death to Euclid\", \"mathematics is on the edge of a philosophical breakdown since there are different ways of convincing and journals only accept one way, that is, proof\", \"what about insight\", and so on. I was in a funny and difficult situation. To my great surprise and shock, I should convince my mathematician colleagues that proof is indeed important, that it is not just one ritual, and so on. Do mathematicians not preach what they practice (or ought to practice)? I am indeed puzzled! \n\n**Reaction**: Here I try to explain the circumstances leading me to ask such \"odd\" question. I don't know it is MO or not, but I try. That afternoon, I came back late and I couldn't go to sleep for the things that I had heard. I was aware of the \"strange\" ideas of one of the panelist. So, I could say to myself, no worry. But, the greatest attack came from one of the audience, graduated from Princeton and a well\\-established mathematician around. \"Philosophical breakdown\" (see above) was the exact term he used, \"quoting\" a very well\\-known mathematician. I knew there were (are) people who put their lives on the line to gain rigor. It was four in the morning that I came to MO, hoping to find something to relax myself, finding the truth perhaps. Have I found it? Not sure. However, I learned what kind of question I cannot ask! \n\n**Update:** The very well\\-known mathematician **who I mentioned above** is John Milnor. I have checked the \"quote\" referred to him with him and he wrote \n\n> **\"it seems very unlikely that I said that...\".**\n\nHere is his \"impromptu answer to the question\" (this is his exact words with his permission):\n\n> Mathematical thought often proceeds from a confused search for what is true to a valid insight into the correct answer. The next step is a careful attempt to organise the ideas in order to convince others.BOTH STEPS ARE ESSENTIAL. Some mathematicians are great at insight but bad at organization, while some have no original ideas, but can play a valuable role by carefully organizing convincing proofs. There is a problem in deciding what level of detail is necessary for a convincing proof\\-\\-\\-but that is very much a matter of taste.\n> \n> \n> **The final test is certainly to have a solid proof. All the insight in the world can't replace it.** One cautionary tale is Dehn's Lemma. This is a true statement, with a false proof that was accepted for many years. When the error was pointed out, there was again a gap of many years before a correct proof was constructed, using methods that Dehn never considered.\n> \n> \n> It would be more interesting to have an example of a false statement which was accepted for many years; but I can't provide an example.\n\n*(emphasis added by YC to the earlier post)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was not going to write anything, as I am a latecomer to this masterful troll question and not many are likely going to scroll all the way down, but Paul Taylor's call for Proof mining and Realizability (or Realisability as the Queen would write it) was irresistible.\n\nNobody asks whether numbers are just a ritual, or at least not very many mathematicians do. Even the most anti\\-scientific philosopher can be silenced with ease by a suitable application of rituals and theories of social truth to the number that is written on his paycheck. At that point the hard reality of numbers kicks in with all its might, may it be Platonic, Realistic, or just Mathematical.\n\nSo what makes numbers so different from proofs that mathematicians will fight a meta\\-war just for the right to attack the heretical idea that mathematics could exist without rigor, but they would have long abandoned this question as irrelevant if it asked instead \"are numbers just a ritual that most mathematicians wish to get rid of\"? We may search for an answer in the fields of sociology and philosophy, and by doing so we shall learn important and sad facts about the way mathematical community operates in a world driven by profit, but as mathematicians we shall never find a truly satisfactory answer there. Isn't philosophy the art of never finding the answers?\n\nInstead, as mathematicians we can and should turn *inwards*. How are numbers different from proofs? The answer is this: **proofs are irrelevant but numbers are not**. This is at the same time a joke and a very serious observation about mathematics. I tell my students that proofs serve two purposes:\n\n1. They convince people (including ourselves) that statements are true.\n2. They convey intuitions, ideas and techniques.\n\nBoth are important, and we have had some very nice quotes about this fact in other answers. Now ask the same question about numbers. What role do numbers play in mathematics? You might hear something like \"they are what mathematics is (also) about\" or \"That's what mathematicians study\", etc. Notice the difference? Proofs are for people but numbers are for mathematics. We admit numbers into mathematical universe as first\\-class citizen but we do not take seriously the idea that proofs themselves are also mathematical objects. We ignore proofs as mathematical objects. Proofs are irrelevant.\n\nOf course you will say that logic takes proofs very seriously indeed. Yes, it does, but in a very limited way:\n\n* It mostly ignores the fact that we use proofs to convey ideas and focuses just on how proofs convey truth. Such practice not only hinders progress in logic, but is also actively harmful because it discourages mathematization of about 50% of mathematical activity. If you do not believe me try getting funding on research in \"mathematical beauty\".\n* It considers proofs as syntactic objects. This puts logic where analysis used to be when mathematicians thought of functions as symbolic expressions, probably sometime before the 19th century.\n* It is largely practiced in isolation from \"normal\" mathematics, by which it is doubly handicapped, once for passing over the rest of mathematics and once for passing over the rest of mathematicians.\n* Consequently even very basic questions, such as \"when are two proofs equal\" puzzle many logicians. This is a ridiculous state of affairs.\n\nBut these are rather minor technical deficiencies. The real problem is that *mainstream* mathematicians are mostly unaware of the fact that proofs can and should be first\\-class mathematical objects. I can anticipate the response: proofs are in the domain of logic, they should be studied by logicians, but normal mathematicians cannot gain much by doing proof theory. I agree, normal mathematicians cannot gain much by doing *traditional* proof theory. But did you know that proofs and computation are intimately connected, and that every time you prove something you have also written a program, and vice versa? That proofs have a homotopy\\-theoretic interpretation that has been discovered only recently? That proofs can be \"mined\" for additional, hidden mathematical gems? This is the stuff of *new* proof theory, which also goes under names such as Realizability, Type theory, and Proof mining.\n\nImagine what will happen with mathematics if logic gets boosted by the machinery of algebra and homotopy theory, if the full potential of \"proofs as computations\" is used in practice on modern computers, if completely new and fresh ways of looking at the nature of proof are explored by the brightest mathematicians who have vast experience outside the field of logic? This will necessarily represent a major shift in how mathematics is done and what it can accomplish.\n\nBecause mathematicians have not reached the level of reflection which would allow them to accept **proof relevant mathematics** they seek security in the mathematically and socially inadequate dogma that a proof can only be a finite syntactic entity. This makes us feeble and weak and unable to argue intelligently with a well\\-versed sociologist who can wield the weapons of social theories, anthropology and experimental psychology.\nSo the best answer to the question \"is rigor just a ritual\" is to study rigor as a *mathematical concept*, to quantify it, to abstract it, and to turn it into something new, flexible and beautiful. Then we will laugh at our old fears, wonder how we ever could have thought that rigor is absolute, and we will become the teachers of our critics."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: According to the answer, what is the primary issue with how mathematicians currently view proofs?\n\nA) Mathematicians overemphasize the importance of proofs in mathematics.\nB) Mathematicians do not consider proofs as first-class mathematical objects.\nC) Mathematicians focus too much on the syntactic nature of proofs.\nD) Mathematicians believe proofs are irrelevant to mathematical practice.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer argues that the main problem is that \"mainstream mathematicians are mostly unaware of the fact that proofs can and should be first-class mathematical objects.\" The author contrasts this with how numbers are treated in mathematics, stating that \"We admit numbers into mathematical universe as first-class citizen but we do not take seriously the idea that proofs themselves are also mathematical objects.\" This perspective is central to the author's argument for a new approach to proof theory and the need for \"proof relevant mathematics.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the answer doesn't suggest that proofs are overemphasized, but rather that they are not viewed in the right way.

Here are the assumptions:\n\n* The DS3231 is more accurate.\n\nThe DS3231 accuracy is \u00b12 ppm. The *basic* accuracy of STM32F407 is 5 ppm. However it also has digital calibration feature that allows you to output clock to external pin for measurement and subsequent calibration in 0\\.95 ppm steps.\n\nSo, the achievable accuracy of MCU RTC is **2 times better** than external RTC.\n\n* The power consumption is less with external RTC.\n\nDS3231 consumes 110 \u00b5A in standby mode. STM32F407 requires only 4 \u00b5A in standby mode with SRAM backup or 3\\.3 \u00b5A without backup. Note, that even if you use external interrupt to wake up MCU, both of them will be consuming power in standby.\n\nSo, the power consumption with DS3231 is **33 times more** than with internal RTC only.\n\n* MCU can not calculate Date Time directly.\n\nHere is a quote from the datasheet: \"*Two 32\\-bit registers contain the seconds, minutes, hours (12\\- or 24\\-hour format), day (day of week), date (day of month), month, and year. Compensations for 28\\-, 29\\- (leap year), 30\\-, and 31\\-day months are performed\nautomatically.*\" Not only that, but it also can be programmed for Daylight Saving Time compensation, something that DS3231 cannot do.\n\nSo, RTC in STM32F407 can do **everything DS3231 does, and more**.\n\nTo summarize, there is no need whatsoever to use DS3231 with STM32F407\\.\n\nHaving said that, there is a way to reduce power consumption even more, by using nano\\-power external timer, like [TPL5110](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpl5110.pdf) to switch MCU power supply OFF completely. In this case (called VBAT mode) the RTC will continue running, consuming only 0\\.96 \u00b5A from backup battery. The timer itself adds negligible 35 nA, for total consumption under 1 \u00b5A (3 \u00b5A savings, compared to standby mode)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a low-power microcontroller system with accurate timekeeping capabilities.

When the `$ARGS` variable is expanded in the line `$ARGS`, bash does not re-interpret the quotes. Instead, it treats the entire content as a single argument to the command, including the single quotes.\n\nFor example, `/usr/bin/find '/tmp/test' '-name' 'hello.c'` is interpreted as a single argument with embedded quotes, rather than separate arguments. This causes `find` to look for literal files with names that include the quotes, leading to the \"No such file or directory\" errors.\n\nTo fix this, the function could use an array to store arguments and then use `\"${args[@]}\"` to properly expand them, or use `eval` (with caution due to potential security risks).

Currently we are trying to solve the following problem:\n\nIn various places it is necessary for us to use static helper methods like ImageIO and URLEncoder (both standard Java API) and various other libraries that consist mostly of static methods (like the Apache Commons libraries). But it is extremely difficult to test those methods that use such static helper classes.\n\nI have several ideas for solving this problem:\n\n1. Use a mock framework that can mock static classes (like PowerMock). This may be the simplest solution but somehow feels like giving up.\n2. Create instantiable wrapper classes around all those static utilities so they can be injected into the classes that use them. This sounds like a relatively clean solution but I fear we'll end up creating an awful lot of those wrapper classes.\n3. Extract every call to these static helper classes into a function that can be overridden and test a subclass of the class I actually want to test.\n\nBut I keep thinking that this just has to be a problem that many people have to face when doing TDD \\- so there must already be solutions for this problem.\n\nWhat is the best strategy to keep classes that use these static helpers testable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (No \"official\" sources here, I'm afraid \\- it's not like there's a specification for how to test well. Just my opinions, which will hopefully be useful.)\n\nWhen these static methods represent *genuine* dependencies, create wrappers. So for things like:\n\n* ImageIO\n* HTTP clients (or anything else network\\-related)\n* The file system\n* Getting the current time (my favourite example of where dependency injection helps)\n\n... it makes sense to create an interface.\n\nBut many of the methods in Apache Commons probably *shouldn't* be mocked/faked. For example, take a method to join together a list of strings, adding a comma between them. There's *no point* in mocking these \\- just let the static call do its normal work. You don't want or need to replace the normal behaviour; you're not dealing with an external resource or something that's hard to work with, it's just data. The result is predictable and you'd never want it to be anything *other* than what it'll give you anyway.\n\nI suspect that having removed all the static calls which really are *convenience* methods with predictable, \"pure\" outcomes (like base64 or URL encoding) rather than entry points into a whole big mess of logical dependencies (like HTTP) you'll find it's entirely practical to do the right thing with the genuine dependencies."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and faces challenges with testing classes that use static helper methods from Java API and Apache Commons libraries.

Creating wrappers for genuine dependencies like ImageIO, network operations, and file system access allows for proper mocking and isolation in tests. However, for pure utility functions like string manipulation or encoding (e.g., those found in Apache Commons), direct static calls are acceptable as they are predictable, \"pure\" operations that don't introduce external dependencies or side effects.\n\nOption A (using PowerMock for all static methods) is excessive and can make tests more complex and slower.\nOption B (creating wrappers for all static methods) introduces unnecessary abstraction and maintenance overhead for simple utility functions.\nOption C (extracting all static calls into overridable functions) is cumbersome and doesn't distinguish between genuine dependencies and simple utility functions.\n\nThe correct approach (D) focuses on isolating true dependencies while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable for straightforward utility operations."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1022849", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/541917/"], "docs_id": 1022849, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As stated, my M.2 Samsung SM951 NVMe drive refuses to be seen in 3 Ubuntu installations.

Start the computer\n2. Access System Setup by pressing F2 key when you see the Dell logo. See here for details.\n3. Go to System Configuration then SATA operations, and finally change from RAID On to Disabled.\n4. Apply changes and exit.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Following [this suggestion](https://askubuntu.com/questions/707494/primary-ssd-on-dell-precision-7510-cannot-be-detected-by-ubuntu-installer/719460#719460), this is required to ensure the NMVe disk is found during installation.\n* As originally suggested in [Dell documentation](http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/SLN299303/pt), specifying boot option `nvme_load=YES` does not work.\n\n---\n\nNow here are some comments regarding dual boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 15\\.10\\.\n\nConsidering that:\n\n* changing the SATA operation mode from `RAID On` to either `AHCI` or `Disabled` prevents Windows 7 from starting. A BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) appears.\n* proposed solution like `Registry Fix to Migrate from ATA Mode to AHCI Mode or RAID On Mode in Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7` failed. See `http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/SLN285045`\n\nI resumed to install only Ubuntu 15\\.10\\.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Since Ubuntu can be installed with SATA operation set to either `AHCI` or `Disabled`, selecting `AHCI` and doing a fresh install of Windows 7 should work. (I have **NOT** tested)\n* That said, if you would like optimum performance, disabling SATA Operation and using NVMe protocol is best. The problem is that, as of January 2016, there are no NVMe Windows7 driver for SSD hard drive of type Samsung SM951 (the one installed in Precision M7510\\). This means that it is not possible to boot or install Windows 7 with SATA operations disabled.\n* A possible workaround is to create a bootable Windows 7 USB disk, by re\\-using the virtual OS originally bundled with the Window 10 install. The following post provide more details: `http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2817439/install-windows-x64-sm951-drive.html#16747080`\n* An other option would be to try to use the \u201c950 PRO NVMe Driver\u201d available at `http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/support/downloads.html`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A user is trying to install Ubuntu on a Dell Precision 7510 laptop with a Samsung SM951 NVMe SSD, but Ubuntu cannot detect the drive.

Physics ${\\\\it is}$ all about applying math to the actual world. Often when asking for a \"physical\" argument, people is fact ask for an analogy with something they already know.\n\nThat being being said, let me add my 50 cents to the discussion above. First of all, having energy density becoming zero at some points in space does not mean the energy is not conserved. In one comment you are asking \"...where the energy goes when E and B comes zero?\". The answer is that it flows away. Remember that energy is only conserved ${\\\\it globally}$. Locally the energy density $\\\\rho\\_E$ is just subject to the continuity equation\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho\\_E}{\\\\partial t}\\+div \\\\left(j\\_E \\\\right)\\=0$$\nSo no paradox here.\nAlso, as pointed out several times above, there is nothing special or important in the fact that energy density is modulated in space. The most trivial example is the circularly polarized EM wave. The the magnitude of both E and B are always constant and the energy density is uniform throughout the space.

The documentation explains that energy density becoming zero at certain points does not violate energy conservation. Instead, the energy flows away from these points, following the continuity equation for energy density: \u2202\u03c1E/\u2202t + div(jE) = 0.

The fan\\-out from the receive buffer can be either a star with source\\-series termination for each fanning out line, as in apalopohapa's answer, or a daisy\\-chain with a split termination at the far end. The split termination would be a resitor to ground and one to Vcc, providing a Thevenin equivalent of R0 to VCC/2\\. R0 would match your nominal transmission line impedance, depending on your track geometry. Using a 50 Ohm characteristic impedance is common, but you will save power if you use a higher value like 75 or 100 Ohms. \n\nWith a maximum 5 inches between DACs you'd be talking about up to 1 ns difference in the update times between the DACs, out of a sampling period of 8 ns. The time difference would be very repeatable over time and temperature because it just depends on the track lengths between the chips.\n\nN.B.

The small size of the PCB (5\"x5\") means the maximum timing difference between DACs would be about 1 ns, which is acceptable for the 125 MHz clock (8 ns period). This approach also allows for flexibility in termination methods to match the characteristic impedance of the tracks. While using individual buffers (option B) wouldn't cause problems, it adds unnecessary cost and complexity for this specific layout. Direct connection from the FPGA (option A) could lead to signal integrity issues, especially across the ribbon cable. Using multiple PLLs (option D) would be overkill and potentially introduce synchronization challenges."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/07/17", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/456013", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/77621/"], "docs_id": 456013, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a single word that represents a 'growing conviction' or 'increasingly convinced'? \n\nFor example:\n\n> Montag's growing conviction of the importance of books is evident by the end of the first section.\n\nor \n\n> Montag becomes increasingly convinced of the importance of books by the end of the first section.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Montag's **certainty** of the importance of books is evident by the end of the first section.\n\n**certainty** [TFD](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/certainty)\n\n> 1.

And see if that cuts down on your login connections. If not than I would suggest going the more extreme route and configuring fail2ban. But again be very careful and thoroughly read through the setup documentation.\n\n---\n\nI would create a second `sshd` service running on another port number and leave it there until you begin to experience the login issue. Then the next time the issue occurs, I would try connecting to that other `sshd` and see if you can find more information out about your issue.\n\nCreate debugging sshd on port `6022` (you need to do this because the original sshd is already running on port 22\\).\n\n```\n# nohup /usr/sbin/sshd -p 6022 -ddd > ~/sshd.log 2>&1 &\n\n```\n\n* **nohup**: run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non\\-tty\n* **\\-p**: set port number (in this case 6022\\)\n* **\\> \\~/sshd.log 2\\>\\&1**: redirect stdout and stderr to \\~/sshd.log\n* **\\&**: If a command is terminated by the control operator \\&, the shell executes the command in the background in\na subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0\\.\n\nThis new sshd will only accept one connection and will terminate after that connection has succeed. \n\n```\n# ssh -vvv -p 6022 user@remotehostname\n[OR]\n# ssh -vvv -p 6022 user@remoteIPaddress\n\n```\n\nThe next time you hang you can see if:\n\n1. Was it just the sshd running on port 22 that was the problem? Did 6022 succeed?\n2. If 22 and 6022 both hang, then you can compare the logs from the \\-ddd server output and the client's \\-vvv output to see if you can uncover more information about the issue.\n\n---\n\nAnother thing you can check is MTU, I have experienced something similar before when there was a miss\\-match in MTU size between the server and the client. You should compare the two to see if there is any miss\\-match.\n\n```\n[root ~]# ifconfig            # I removed sensitive information:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is experiencing intermittent SSH connection issues to a CentOS 6.5 server.

Additionally negative votes are essentially capped to 3 (to allow deletion) and in super rare cases reach 10\\-15 (posts that are either outrageously rude or asking for malicious code) while upvotes are unbounded \\- this makes it even less likely to meet condition of the ban.\n\nFor possible action as [Cody Gray said in a comment](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/398811/does-a-streak-of-poorly-received-questions-not-affect-the-poster#comment778813_398811) use custom flag if you feel necessary:\n\n> ...by raising a confidential flag on one of their posts and highlighting the pattern of recent, low\\-quality questions.  \n> \n> ...Yes, I mean a custom flag. I used the word \"confidential\" to make clear that moderator flags are confidential, which avoids concerns about publicly calling out a particular user (which you wouldn't want to do on Meta).\n\nUsing a custom flag is especially recommended when you are tempted to downvote all recent questions by the author triggering \"revenge downvote\" pattern. This is very likely to happen in such \"streak of bad questions\" cases (\"you *censored* posted 4 nearly identical questions and did not even look at comments\"). If that happens the safest option is to custom flag and to consider ignoring posts from that user for some time for your own sake.\n\nNote so that lack of research alone does not make the question off\\-topic on Stack Overflow. Such questions are still eligible for answers and may even eventually collect positive votes as being useful (ideally someone would improve question too, but that is not strictly required)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason why a high-reputation user on StackExchange might be able to continue posting poorly received questions without facing significant consequences?\n\nA) The user's past positive contributions outweigh recent negative ones\nB) Downvotes on questions are capped at 3 votes\nC) Poorly received questions are automatically deleted after a certain time\nD) High-reputation users are immune to question bans\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that a streak of poorly received questions does not significantly impact users with relatively high reputation. This is primarily because the system considers the user's overall contribution history. If a user has occasionally posted useful questions in the past, it is likely to outweigh recent negative contributions. The ban system looks at the consistently non-positive average contribution, so past positive contributions can prevent a ban even if recent questions are poorly received.\n\nWhile option B mentions a fact from the documentation (downvotes being essentially capped at 3 for most cases), this is not the primary reason high-rep users can continue posting poorly received questions.

What is the primary purpose of this parameter, and how can a user remove it in Ubuntu 20.04?\n\nA) The parameter is used for tracking user behavior. To remove it, edit the Firefox configuration file directly.\n\nB) It's a bug in Firefox. To fix it, update to the latest version of the browser.\n\nC) The parameter is used for revenue sharing. To remove it, uninstall and reinstall Firefox from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nD) It's used for revenue sharing and collecting anonymous usage data. To remove it, delete the pre-installed DuckDuckGo search engine in Firefox preferences and add it again from the Firefox Add-ons directory.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The \"t=canonical\" parameter is added through partnerships between DuckDuckGo and developers/companies. It serves two purposes: to assign advertising revenue and to collect anonymous aggregate usage information. This allows DuckDuckGo to share a portion of its advertising revenue with partners.\n\nTo remove this parameter in Ubuntu 20.04, users need to:\n1. Open Firefox preferences and go to the Search section.\n2. Remove the pre-installed DuckDuckGo search engine.\n3. Download the DuckDuckGo search engine again from the Firefox Add-ons directory.\n4. Set the newly added DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.\n\nThis method is more effective and user-friendly than editing system files, which was the solution for older Ubuntu versions. It doesn't require updating Firefox or reinstalling the entire browser, making option D the correct and most comprehensive answer."}}
