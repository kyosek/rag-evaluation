And this redefinition does call `\\@listi`, `\\@listii`. Something that the original definition of `trivlist` in the LaTeX kernel does not.\n* KOMA\\-Script classes has extra code in `\\@listi` etc. for documents (or passages of documents) to avoid addition of `\\parskip` and usual `\\topsep`. This sets `\\topsep` to zero whenever `\\parskip` is greater than zero. But inside `enumitem`'s `trivlist` `\\parskip` is already greater than zero, when `\\@listi` (etc.) is called. So `\\topsep` is set to zero.\n\nHowever `enumitem` does also provide an option `ignoredisplayed` as a workaround for such problems:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{scrartcl}\n\\usepackage{amsthm}\n\\newtheorem{test}{Test}\n\\usepackage[ignoredisplayed]{enumitem}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item\n    Here is text.\n\n    \\begin{test}\n      Here is a proposition.\n    \\end{test}\n\n    Here is more text.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nor you can setup `trivlist` to explicitly set `\\topsep`:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{scrartcl}\n\\usepackage{amsthm}\n\\newtheorem{test}{Test}\n\\usepackage{enumitem}\n\\setlist[trivlist]{topsep=8pt plus 4pt minus 4pt} \n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item\n    Here is text.\n\n    \\begin{test}\n      Here is a proposition.\n    \\end{test}\n\n    Here is more text.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\na third suggestion would be to patch `enumitem`'s redefinition of `trivlist` to not execute KOMA\\-Script's extra list code:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{scrartcl}\n\\usepackage{amsthm}\n\\newtheorem{test}{Test}\n\\usepackage{enumitem}\n\\usepackage{xpatch}\n\\makeatletter\n% Hack to not use KOMA-Script's extra list code inside enumitem's redefinition of trivlist\n\\xpatchcmd\\trivlist{%\n  \\csname @list\\romannumeral\\the\\@listdepth\\endcsname\n}{%\n  \\let\\orig@list@extra\\@list@extra\n  \\let\\@list@extra\\relax\n  \\csname @list\\romannumeral\\the\\@listdepth\\endcsname\n  \\let\\@list@extra\\orig@list@extra\n}{}{}\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item\n    Here is text.\n\n    \\begin{test}\n      Here is a proposition.\n    \\end{test}\n\n    Here is more text.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThis is something, `enumitem` or KOMA\\-Script could do as a workaround to avoid the problem in this context. However, the problem does also occur using a standard class and package `parskip`, e.g.:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{parskip}\n\\usepackage{amsthm}\n\\newtheorem{test}{Test}\n\\usepackage{enumitem}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item\n    Here is text.\n\n    \\begin{test}\n      Here is a proposition.\n    \\end{test}\n\n    Here is more text.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nso it is not related and not restricted to KOMA\\-Script.

The van is brutally hot during the day even in the so called South Florida winter. It's okay though, cause I drive w the windows open and I don't really spend much time in the van during the day if not driving and when I do it's parked at the beach under a tree (NICE). Anyways, I'm not sure if it's just me or what, but at night the bare black metal that had cooked during the day van, is much colder than my prior highly insulated SUV.

A few nights ago it was just flat out freezing in the van at midnight and just 6 hours earlier you could fry an egg on the roof. \n\nI am wondering, will insulation make my van hotter at night in the summer?

In particular the treatment of light passing through a polarizing medium is handled with two sub rules: (a) The emerging light takes on the polarization of the medium and (b) the intensity is reduced by the rule $I \\= I\\_0 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta$ (or a suitable integration thereof). Not a hint there of the measurement not affecting the subject. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nBut for most cases in classical physics it is *in principle* possible to reduce the effect of the measurement to be smaller than dominant uncertainties in the problem (i.e. the time at which an apparatus passes some critical point can be measured with an IR photogate that introduces only trivial changes in the experimental conditions).\n\nPractical instruction on making these kind of things work is one of the goals of the (often sadly neglected) laboratory component of physics instruction.\n\nQuantum physics doesn't introduce the rule that the measurement affects the measured system (despite the many, many pop\\-sci treatment that either say that outright or give that impression). What is *does* is put bound on your ability to both make an accurate measurement and avoid significantly disturbing the system at the same time. No such bound is present in the theory of classical mechanics,1 though there are practical bounds which are often (usually!) more significant than the Uncertainty Principle.\n\n---\n\n1 Mind you, exactly the same kind of bound is present in wave optics.2 Alas, many introductory treatments don't point out the places where this shows up, even when doing the wave physics. That is, they neglect to mention that the Rayleigh Criterion and the single\\-slit diffraction patterns are exactly the same physics that shows up in the HUP.\n\n2 And it is due to the nature of waves.

It's also possible that this is a question better suited for a computer science stack exchange.\n\nThe final application will be: given some set of coordinates on a sphere (i.e. the border of a country), find the minimum bounding circle on the sphere. I can imagine this is a problem that mapping software has figured out (like when you search for a country on Google Earth and it rotates the planet to perfectly center it). We can also safely assume that all of the points are contained within a hemisphere of the sphere, and in reality these points are a lot closer together than that.\n\nI've tried to think through it logically, and I believe I'm approaching a rudimentary solution. A \"circle on a sphere\" is better represented by a plane's intersection with the sphere, and there are known simple algorithms for determining if a point in 3D space is above or below a plane. So we need to find the \"best fit\" plane where all of the points are \"above\" the plane, from the viewpoint of the center of the sphere. It seems most logical to define the plane in terms of the three variables, none of which can be fixed:\n\n1. `\u03c6` \\- latitude \\[0, \u03c0/2]\n2. `\u03bb` \\- longitude \\[\\-\u03c0, \u03c0]\n3. `h` \\- height from center of sphere (0, r)\n\nSo when we define it in terms of these variables, we're looking for a plane with the maximum value of `h`. I can imagine the algorithm would iteratively look at every point, and when a point lies under the plane, it would move the plane to bring that point above it (or ON the plane), slightly widening the circle in the process. But this process of adjusting the plane is not as trivial as I originally thought, and a simple solution would not produce the minimum bounding circle.\n\nAs I said, I apologize in advance for the likely duplicate question; I'm pretty sure this is a solved problem, and I am hoping the answer is just a link to a Wikipedia article or previous answered question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Use [**stereographic projection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection) $P$ with center the North pole $N$ mapping any point $M$ of the unit sphere onto $P(M)\\=M'$ into its equatorial plane with property:\n\n$$N,M,M' \\\\ \\\\text{aligned}\\\\tag{1}$$\n\nOne of the main properties of this transformation is that circles on the sphere are mapped onto circles into the equatorial plane.\n\nTherefore the principle is to transform the set of points $P\\_k$s on the sphere onto a set of points $P'\\_k$s on the equatorial plane, determine the smallest enclosing circle of these points, and then send it back on the sphere.\n\nThe transformation formula (1\\) can be given an analytical form : $$\\\\begin{cases}x'\\&\\=\\&\\\\frac{x}{1\\-z}\\\\\\\\y'\\&\\=\\&\\\\frac{y}{1\\-z}\\\\end{cases}$$\n\nThe inverse transform can be given the following form\n\n$$\\\\begin{cases}x\\&\\=\\&2x'/D\\\\\\\\y\\&\\=\\&2y'/D\\\\\\\\z\\&\\=\\&(\\-1\\+x^2\\+y^2\\)/D \\\\end{cases} \\\\ \\\\text{with} \\\\ D:\\=1\\+x^2\\+y^2$$\n\ndue to relationship:\n\n$$\\\\vec{NM'}\\=2 \\\\dfrac{\\\\vec{NM}}{\\\\\\|NM\\\\\\|^2}$$\n\nRemark: the stereographic projection is a particular case of an inversion, i.e. , the inversion with center $N$ and power $2$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A geographer is working on a project to find the minimum bounding circle for a set of coordinates representing a country's border on a spherical Earth model.

When a MOSFET (P or N\\-channel) is on it conducts in both directions.\n\nBut, in order for a discrete MOSFET to block current, the body diode must be reverse\\-biased. The circuits you linked to are correct.

However, this configuration is essential for proper operation. When the power supply is connected correctly, the MOSFET is turned on and conducts with low resistance in both directions through its channel. \n\nThe key to understanding this circuit is the body diode of the MOSFET. In normal operation, this diode is reverse-biased, allowing the MOSFET to control current flow. If the MOSFET were reversed, the body diode would become forward-biased in a reverse polarity situation, defeating the purpose of the protection circuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because these circuits are properly designed. Option B is wrong as the MOSFET is not being used as a diode, but as a controllable switch. Option D is a misconception about MOSFET operation.

The documentation explains that LED drivers, which are switching power supplies, can create a \"relaxation oscillator\" effect when there's only a trickle of power available. This can happen if the lamp's switch has a light or remote-control circuit that allows a small amount of current through, or if there's a dimmer that isn't cutting off completely. In these cases, the LED driver repeatedly tries to charge up, turn on the LED, immediately run out of power, and then repeat the cycle. This matches the described behavior of the LED bulb turning on and off for a split second randomly.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while flickering can sometimes indicate the end of an LED's lifespan, the specific behavior described is more likely due to power supply issues.\n\nAnswer B is unlikely as the user mentioned they checked for damage and couldn't detect any.

This means the central thread needs to allocate memory that the worker threads then free. This means there is unbalanced allocation flow (one thread allocates, another thread frees) which makes practically any reasonable allocator slow, meaning only few million blocks per second of performance.\n\nAlso, you cannot use blocking queues to transfer work blocks from one thread to another thread at a performance of more than few million operations per second unless doing some weird performance\\-enhancing tricks.\n\nNow, I don't know how big is you task rate.

The documentation explains that at very high task rates, the worker approach becomes inefficient due to inter-CPU communication costs, memory allocation imbalances, and limitations of blocking queues. A cluster approach reduces these bottlenecks by allowing each process to handle both API requests and background tasks independently, leveraging the full capacity of each node without the overhead of task dispatching.

Who **has** already read three English novels?\n> 2. Who **have** already read three English novels?\n\nOr could both be correct?\n\nPlease also provide the grammatical reasons for your answers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The OP's question involves the topic of interrogative pronouns (e.g. **\"who\"** and **\"what\"**) and the question of whether they could be considered to be singular or plural.\n\n***In general***, the interrogative pronoun **\"who\"** takes the **default value of singular**; and when it does take the value of singular, its question can allow both singular and plural answers. And so, that's why we often see questions using the default singular (that is, singular subject\\-verb agreement).\n\nBut when the speaker is expecting only a plural answer, then the speaker could use a **plural override** when forming their question \\-\\- but usually that is not obligatory, and usually the speaker can still use the default singular in their question. But, sometimes there are exceptions, when the plural override is **obligatory**, and that obligatory plural override often occurs when the grammar of the question requires or strongly prefers a plural verb (e.g. a predicative complement realized by a plural noun phrase).\n\nSo, with that as a grammatical background, let's look at the OP's context for those candidate questions. The OP's context is described as:\n\n> The situation is that: We've already read three English novels.\n\nwhere I'm assuming that two or more of the addressees have read at least 3 novels. It is possible that the \"we\" includes only the speaker and one other person, but I'd think it more feasible that there are three or more people involved here (e.g. a classroom with more than one teacher and two students). The rest of my post will work with that assumption: there is a speaker and at least two addressees.\n\nIf the speaker doesn't really know whether the answer will be singular or plural, or is willing to expect either a singular or plural answer, then the speaker will (in general) use the **default singular** for their question:\n\n> 1\\) Who **has** already read three English novels?\n\nbecause that allows both a singular and a plural answer.\n\nBut if the speaker expects that more than two (students) will respond in the affirmative, then, often the speaker might choose to use the **optional plural override:**\n\n> 2\\) Who **have** already read three English novels?\n\nbecause the speaker is expecting to get two or more affirmative answers. But, this is optional to the speaker; the speaker can still use the default singular version, because this is not one of the exceptions that I had mentioned earlier.\n\n**ANSWER:** So, to answer the OP's questions:\n\n> Which is the correct question for that situation? Or could both be correct?\n\nfor the specific candidate questions, it seems that both versions could be considered to be grammatical for that given context. It would be up to the speaker as to which one they would want to use.\n\n\\= \\= \\= \\= \\= SOME VETTED GRAMMATICAL INFO \\= \\= \\= \\= \\=\n\nOP asked:\n\n> Please also provide the grammatical reasons for your answers.\n\nFor more information on this topic, there is the 2002 reference grammar by Huddleston and Pullum et al., *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* (CGEL), pages 505\\-6\\.\n\nRelated excerpt from *CGEL* pages 505\\-6:\n\n> **(d) Interrogatives**\n> \n> \n> In general, the interrogative pronouns *who* and *what* take the default value of singular.

In \\[ii], with determinative *which* as fused determiner\\-head, we have a singular or plural verb according to whether the answer is presupposed to be singular or plural.\n> \n> \n> The default singular values for *who* and *what* can, however, be overridden when there is a presupposition that the answer is plural:\n> \n> \n> \\[20]\n> \n> \n> * i. *What are going to be the deciding factors?*\n> * ii. *Who haven't yet handed in their assignments?*\n> * iii. *Who have excelled themselves in this year's coxed pairs?*\n> * iv. *What have pointed ears and long tails?*\n> \n> \n> In \\[i] the override is obligatory: this case is similar to those discussed for fused relatives such as \\[18\\.i], with the plural PC *the deciding factors* forcing a plural construal of *what*.\n> \n> \n> A likely context for \\[20\\.ii] is one where I'm addressing a group of students and assuming that a plurality of them haven't handed in their assignments; singular *hasn't* would be possible (but without indicating any expectation of a plural answer and favouring singular *assignment* if there is only one each).\n> \n> \n> In \\[20\\.iii], coxed pairs involve three people (two rowers and the cox), so the presupposition is again that the answer is plural. The reflexive has to be plural, and this favours a plural verb.\n> \n> \n> Finally, \\[iv] presupposes a generic bare plural as answer, e.g. *foxes*, but the motivation for a plural override is relatively small since the answer could be given in the form of a generic singular, e.g. *a fox*.\n\n---\n\nThere's also some related information in the older 1985 reference grammar by Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, Svartvik, *A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language* (1985 Quirk et al.). On page 371, footnote \\[a]:\n\n> **\\[a]** *Who* has both singular and plural reference, but when neither is explicit in the linguistic context, singular concord is the unmarked term. Thus, even though several voices are heard outside, the natural question will be *Who's there?* rather than ?\\* *Who're there?*\n\nNote that the *?\\** symbol means: *tending to unacceptability, but not fully unacceptable.* Also, on page 756, footnote \\[a]:\n\n> **\\[a]** . . . Similarly, interrogative *who* and *what* as subjects normally take a singular verb even when the speaker has reason to believe that more than one person or entity is involved: *Who is making all that noise?* However, a plural verb may be used if other words in the sentence indicate that a plural subject is expected in the answer (*Who have not received their passes?*). . . .\n\n---\n\nEDITED: As a commenter has [mentioned](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/30443/which-is-the-correct-question-who-has-vs-who-have/31139#comment57766_31139), there are also echo questions, where the \"who\" question can easily use a plural verb. For example:\n\n* A: *\"That gorgeous blonde girl that just moved in across the street, and the redhead that you're too shy to talk to, and also that girl who's always trying to beat you up on the playground, they are coming to your birthday party.\"*\n* B: *\"Who are coming to my party?\"*\n\nOr perhaps the simpler example as given by the commentator:\n\n* A: *\"They have done it.\"*\n* B: *\"Who have done it?\"*\n\n---\n\nHere's an example borrowed from a [comment in a related thread](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/52038/is-who-singular-or-plural/52040?noredirect=1#comment97257_52040), where a plural verb might be obligatory:\n\n* *\"Who haven't faced each other in the competition yet?\"*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"who\" with singular or plural verbs is correct?\n\nA) \"Who\" always requires a singular verb, regardless of context.\nB) \"Who\" always requires a plural verb when referring to multiple people.\nC) \"Who\" typically takes a singular verb by default, but can take a plural verb in certain contexts.\nD) The choice between singular and plural verbs with \"who\" is completely arbitrary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the nuanced usage of \"who\" in questions.

Do I have to use database or can I do it without that with some kind of caching, inmemory etc which releases ever 10 minutes etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have done this, so I know how it is optimally done. The idea is to use a hash function such as [SipHash](https://131002.net/siphash/) to calculate a hash value for the IP address. Then you use a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm for each hash bucket: have e.g. 100 initial tokens in each hash bucket, add 10 tokens per second up to a maximum of 100 tokens, and remove one token every time you get a request, or else if there are no tokens, reject the request. This would allow 10 requests per second with a maximum burst size of 100\\.\n\nTheoretically, it is possible that two IP addresses hash to the same bucket, but that is not a problem in this use case, if you have enough hash buckets.\n\nAs for updating the buckets, you can do them using batch timers. E.g. for 131072 buckets, you could update e.g. 4096 buckets per each timer and then have 32 timers evenly expiring within a second. So, at 1/32 seconds, you update the first 4096 buckets, at 2/32 seconds, you update the next 4096 buckets, etc. The data structure for maintaining timers is optimally a [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) such as a [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap).\n\nWhen implemented this way, if somebody floods your system by numerous forged source IP addresses, your memory doesn't get filled.\n\nThe memory used by this approach uses 8, 16 or 32 bits per each hash bucket if you use an integer array. The integer size comes from your requirements: e.g. 8 bits cannot support more than burst sizes of 255\\. Similarly, 16 bits allow burst sizes of at most 65535\\. So, e.g. 8 bits or 1 byte per bucket and 131072 buckets takes 128 kilobytes of memory. Nowhere close to being a problem. A good machine has at least 2 GB of memory, meaning over 15 000 times the amount you require for this system.\n\nYou need to consider memory bandwidth as well: if each bucket is updated once per second, the bandwidth required is 128 KB/s. Good computers support over 5 GB/s read\\+write bandwidth, or over 40 000 times what this proposal of mine uses.\n\nDo save the cache into RAM. Don't use a database or disk file for it. If your system crashes, well, then you just initialize all buckets to the initial value."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to implement rate limiting for their public API endpoint that allows visitors to send subscription emails.

Even the, EM energies are the kinetic energy of quantum particles such as photons.\n\nThis is simply incorrect, and starting with this incorrect premise may be the reason for your confusion.\n\nGravitational potential energy and electrostatic potential energy are both examples of non\\-kinetic energy that is eligible to do work. In a purely electrostatic field (as opposed to a dynamic electromagnetic field) there are no real photons with the usual KE and momentum relationship typical of photons (i.e. on shell).\n\n> The velocity of an particle can be defined as the change of its space as the time changes or change in its spacetime respect to an observer.\n\nI have never seen any example where any professional physicist refers to the velocity of a particle as the \"change in its spacetime\". I would not recommend using this terminology as it is almost guaranteed to cause confusion.\n\n> So my question is, Is energy only the change in spacetime of an object with respect to an observer?\n\nReplacing the strange terminology \"change in spacetime\" with the standard terminology \"velocity\" this question becomes:\n\n\"Is energy only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer?\"\n\nThe answer is an emphatic \"No\"! Energy is not only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer. Even kinetic energy is $\\\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ which includes mass as well as velocity. So this idea does not work even strictly for kinetic energy. However, as mentioned above, energy is more than just kinetic energy.\n\nThe usual way to define energy is through [Noether's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem). This is probably the single most important theoretical result in all of physics. Noether's theorem shows that continuous symmetries of the action result in a conserved quantity. In the case of energy, [energy is the conserved quantity due to the time\\-translation symmetry of the action](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/%7Ekleinert/b6/psfiles/Chapter-7-conslaw.pdf).\n\nA typical Lagrangian of a point particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V$ would be $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\- V(x)$$ this Lagrangian is time invariant, so applying Noether's theorem gives the conserved energy $$H\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\+ V(x)$$ which is not just the velocity $\\\\dot x$, it also includes the mass $m$ and the potential energy $V$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about energy in physics is most accurate?\n\nA) Only kinetic energy is capable of doing work, and all forms of energy can be reduced to the kinetic energy of particles.\n\nB) Energy is solely determined by the velocity of an object with respect to an observer.\n\nC) Energy is the conserved quantity resulting from the time-translation symmetry of the action, as described by Noether's Theorem.\n\nD) The energy of a particle can be defined as the change in its spacetime with respect to an observer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because non-kinetic forms of energy, such as gravitational and electrostatic potential energy, can also do work. \nOption B is incorrect as it oversimplifies the concept of energy, ignoring mass and potential energy contributions. \nOption C is correct, as it accurately describes the fundamental definition of energy in physics based on Noether's Theorem. \nOption D uses non-standard terminology and is not an accurate description of energy in physics.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the most comprehensive and accurate understanding of energy in modern physics, emphasizing its connection to fundamental symmetries in nature."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/31", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/209019", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/51035/"], "docs_id": 209019, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am wondering if there is a standard projection if you want to map the neighboring countries of Germany, Switzerland and Austria (known as \"DACH\" in equal\\-area?\n\nFor Europe there is EPSG:3035 which seems centered on Germany.

Any hints?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In algebraic geometry, this construction is known as the *tangent cone* to the graph. More generally, suppose we have the zero set of any polynomial $f(x,y) \\= 0$, and assume $f(0,0\\)\\=0$. Then we can write\n\n$f(x,y) \\= a\\_m (x,y) \\+ a\\_{m\\+1}(x,y) \\+a\\_{m\\+2}(x,y) \\+\\\\cdots$\n\nwhere $a\\_i(x,y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $i$ and $a\\_m$ is nonzero. The zero set of $a\\_m$ is called the tangent cone to the curve at the origin. It is a product of $m$ linear forms (over $\\\\mathbb{C}$), and $m\\=1$ exactly when the zero set is smooth at the origin. In this case, the tangent cone coincides with the tangent space.\n\nFrom your point of view, when we substitute $x\\\\mapsto x/c$ and $y\\\\mapsto y/c$ it is clear that the term left in the limit is $a\\_m$.\n\nWe can of course find tangent cones at other points of the zero set by changing coordinates.\n\nIn general, for a smooth function $f$ you should be able to take a multivariate Taylor expansion and read off the tangent cone from the lowest degree part. This is where the difficulty comes in for actually defining the tangent line in terms of the tangent cone in a calculus class, as computing the Taylor expansion demands we already have a notion of derivative. This difficulty is obviously not seen in the case of polynomials, although recentering the Taylor expansion of a polynomial at a different point is perhaps easiest done with the aid of derivatives.\n\nHigher dimensional analogues are also available without any real work, although in the singular case the tangent cone is much more interesting than just a union of hyperplanes: it will be a cone over some variety. The homogeneous polynomial $a\\_m(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n)$ typically doesn't factor into a product of linear forms when $n\\>2$.\n\nTangent cones are treated in any reasonable introduction to algebraic geometry, such as Harris' \"First course\" book or Shafarevich."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a curve defined by the equation f(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0. What is the tangent cone of this curve at the origin (0,0)?\n\nA) y = x and y = -x\nB) y^2 = x^2\nC) y = x\nD) x^3 + y^3 = 0\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the tangent cone, we need to identify the lowest degree homogeneous polynomial in the equation. \n\n1) First, we write out the polynomial in order of increasing degree:\n   f(x,y) = -3xy + x^3 + y^3\n\n2) The lowest degree term is -3xy, which is of degree 2. This means m = 2 in the context of the tangent cone definition.\n\n3) However, we need to consider all terms of degree 2 to form a_m(x,y). In this case, there's only one such term: -3xy.\n\n4) To find the tangent cone, we set a_m(x,y) = 0:\n   -3xy = 0\n\n5) This can be factored as:\n   -3x(y) = 0\n   \n   Which gives us either x = 0 or y = 0\n\n6) These two lines can be combined into the single equation:\n   y^2 = x^2\n\nTherefore, the tangent cone at the origin is described by the equation y^2 = x^2, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThis question tests understanding of tangent cones, homogeneous polynomials, and factorization, making it a challenging problem for an advanced calculus or introductory algebraic geometry exam."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/22", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/161168", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/33058/"], "docs_id": 161168, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: System cron starts Magento 2 cron every minute:\n\n```\n$ crontab -l\n*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/php /home/user/prj/mage2/bin/magento cron:run >> /home/user/prj/mage2/var/log/cron.log\n\n```\n\nI see new line `Ran jobs by schedule.` is added every minute into the log.\n\nThis is my settings for my task:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_Cron:etc/crontab.xsd\">\n    <group id=\"default\">\n        <job name=\"my_own\" instance=\"\\Vendor\\Module\\Cron\\Task\" method=\"execute\">\n            <schedule>...</schedule>\n        </job>\n    </group>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nThese settings run my job every 15 minutes in fact (my own message is added every 15 minutes into the log):\n\n```\n<schedule>* * * * *</schedule>\n<schedule>*/1 * * * *</schedule>\n\n```\n\nThis is my log:\n\n```\n...\nRan jobs by schedule.\nRan jobs by schedule.\nRan jobs by schedule.\nMy own job is started.\nRan jobs by schedule.\n...\n\n```\n\nThese are Magento 2 cron settings:\n[![Magento 2 Cron settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDo43.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDo43.png)\n\nHow can I set `<schedule>` to run my task every 1 minute?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are 2 groups in Magento 2 cron: `index` \\& `default`.

Which configuration approach is most likely to resolve this issue while maintaining the desired functionality?\n\nA) Add an additional NAT rule specifically for VPN traffic to port 25\nB) Implement a route map with an ACL to exclude VPN traffic from the existing NAT rule\nC) Remove the existing NAT rule and rely solely on VPN routing\nD) Configure split-tunneling on the VPN to bypass the NAT for internal traffic\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution to this problem is to implement a route map with an Access Control List (ACL) to exclude VPN traffic from the existing NAT rule. This approach allows the administrator to maintain the current NAT configuration for external access while creating an exception for VPN users. By using a route map, the administrator can selectively apply NAT rules based on traffic characteristics, such as source or destination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding another NAT rule could lead to conflicts and doesn't address the root cause of the issue.\n\nOption C is incorrect because removing the NAT rule would break external access to the mail server, which is a requirement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while split-tunneling can be useful in some scenarios, it doesn't directly address the NAT issue and could potentially introduce security risks.\n\nThe correct approach (B) allows for fine-grained control over NAT behavior, ensuring that VPN users can access internal resources as needed while maintaining the existing external access configuration."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2008/10/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/231371", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/30958/"], "docs_id": 231371, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Which are the most advanced frameworks and tools there are available for python for practicing Behavior Driven Development?

Dimensions are inherently local. In other words, the dimension of a geometric object $X$ is inherently not a number but a function on $X$ given by the local dimension at $x \\\\in X$. It happens that we often consider $X$ such that the local dimension at every point is the same number $d$, in which case it would make sense to say that $X$ has dimension $d$.

Ground is a reference point and it's easy to get a negative voltage if your ground reference is above earth ground. Does a differential power supply actually produce a negate voltage (referenced to earth ground) or does it just use a voltage offset from ground as a ground reference.\n\nFor example a \\+\\-5V power supply can easily be created by using two voltages (\\+10V, \\+5V) and GND. If you use \\+5V as ground, it will make \\+10V the \\+5 equivalent. GND will become the \\-5V equivalent. The problem with such a circuit is that ground isn't compatible with earth ground. For example you can't then tie your newly created (\\+5V offset) ground to earth ground without creating a short circuit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Voltage may be interpreted as a measure of the potential energy of a theoretical test charge divided by its magnitude (dimensionally, volts are joules per coulomb). As with many potentials in classical physics, this is a relative quantity, meaning that your measurement of a potential is between some two points or states.\n\nPhysically, there is nothing incompatible with the idea that the relative potential of some point P is negative when referenced to earth ground, or any other reference for that matter. All it means is that a theoretical positive charge would lose some amount of potential energy when moving from your earth ground or reference to P.\n\nWe can easily realize this by demonstration with a number of examples that should prove that there's \"truly\" such a thing as a negative DC voltage with reference to earth ground:\n\n1. Electrochemical: Suppose that the ground pin at left is physically earthed by bonding it to earth ground (e.g. by burying an electrode into wet dirt outdoors).

Then, SW1 and SW3 are opened, and then SW2 and SW4 are closed. Since A is below B, but A is now connected to ground (be it earth ground, your Arduino's GND connection, Mars ground, etc), hence B and VOUT are both below earth ground. With the addition of extra capacitors, and the use of fast semiconductor switches, this is something that is [commercially realized](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/3261fb.pdf) as a practical way to produce voltages lower than your lowest supply.\n\nWith the appropriate safety precautions and appropriate components and measurement tools, you should be able to verify both of these examples and claims for yourself if you so desire."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit designer needs to create a -5V supply for a sensitive analog circuit in a system where the main power supply only provides +12V and GND.

The frequency of a photon with respect to coordinate time $t\\=x^0$ is proportional to the zeroth component of its wave\\-vector, we may even set it equal, $k\\_0 \\= f$. Now the zeroth component will evolve as\n$$ \\\\frac{d k\\_0}{d t} \\= \\-\\\\frac{u^t}{2} g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\_{\\\\;\\\\;,t} v\\_\\\\mu v\\_\\\\nu \\\\,,$$\nwhere $v^\\\\mu \\=d x^\\\\mu / d t$ and $u^t \\= dt/d\\\\tau$ (also remember that $v\\_\\\\mu \\= g\\_{\\\\mu\\\\nu} v^\\\\nu$ and $d x^0/d t \\= dt/dt \\= 1$). Of course, if $g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\_{\\\\;\\\\;,t} \\\\approx 0$, the redshift of $k\\_0$ will depend only on your four\\-velocity with respect to the static frame; this can be interpreted in terms of a gravitational potential, velocity etc. On the other hand, if the cumulative effect of $g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\_{\\\\;\\\\;,t}$ cannot be neglected, then talking about gravitational potentials etc. looses meaning.\n\nNow, when $g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\_{\\\\;\\\\;,t}$ is not negligible, you can be an observer static with respect to $t$ and let an emitter emit two photons of the same frequency in their rest\\-frame. The first photon goes straight to you, and the second photon goes through a different path which can be arranged either through a gravitational lens or a mirror deflecting it. *Generally* speaking, the two photons will go through completely different $g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ thus shifting its $k\\_0$ to completely different values before arriving to you. In other words, generally redshift is very much path\\-dependent. \n\nHowever, our universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and it turns out that in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe any photon, even one sent zig\\-zagging through space by a system of mirrors, will end up with a shift of $k\\_0$ that depends only on the ratio of the [scale\\-factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor_(cosmology)) $a$ at the time of its emission and the time of its observation. \n\nWhen we include overdensities that actually occur in our universe, this will generally introduce a noise to this perfectly path\\-independent relation. But if your photon flew at least a few [Megaparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Megaparsecs_and_gigaparsecs) before getting to you and has not been strongly lensed on the way, you can really trust the redshift to indicate the era the photon comes from. In other words, in cosmology, redshift is mostly path\\-independent.\n\nAs for [strong gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_gravitational_lensing), this will induce path dependence if the matter causing the lensing is moving with relativistic speeds with respect to the cosmological background, because otherwise $g^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\_{\\\\;\\\\;,t}$ is small (roughly $\\\\sim V/c$ small, where $V$ is the typical velocity in the system). Matter configurations that exhibit such speeds are black\\-hole and/or neutron\\-star binaries, as well as various catastrophic events such as supernovas. The redshift of the light that passed through such systems would *not* be indicative of its original cosmological era. \n\nHowever, I believe that observing this phenomenon is highly improbable (and I am quite sure it was never observed). As for experimental confirmation that the redshift was path\\-dependent: we would have to observe two photons arriving to us from the same source through two paths, and at least one of them passing through such a relativistic, typically extremely variable system! Such double images of the same source occur habitually in strong lensing, but detecting both of them with sufficient accuracy is even more of a lost case then detecting just one image. I.e., I believe there is no experimental or observational evidence of path dependency of redshift, and there will not be any in the near future. \n\nAs for the tests that of the statement that in quasi\\-stationary fields redshift *is* path\\-independent, one should simply refer to the usual [experimental tests of gravitational redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Gravitational_redshift), because a path\\-dependent theory would necessarily predict deviations from relativistic predictions. On the other hand, I do not believe path\\-independence for photon paths of cosmological scales can be practically tested, since 1\\) most double images correspond to photons that do not travel on very different paths on cosmological scales, and 2\\) we would probably not be able to separate intrinsic variation of redshift within the emitting source (or various other obscuration etc.) from the actual path\\-dependence of the redshift."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of cosmological redshift, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Redshift is entirely path-independent and only depends on the relative velocity and gravitational potential of the transmitter and receiver.\n\nB) Redshift is always significantly path-dependent, regardless of the scale or conditions of the universe through which light travels.\n\nC) Redshift is theoretically path-dependent, but in practice, for cosmological scales in our approximately homogeneous and isotropic universe, it can be considered mostly path-independent.\n\nD) Redshift is only path-dependent for short-distance light travel within our galaxy, but becomes path-independent over intergalactic distances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While redshift is theoretically path-dependent, as shown by the mathematical expression for the evolution of a photon's frequency, in practice, for cosmological scales in our universe, it can be considered mostly path-independent. This is because our universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and for photons traveling over large distances (at least a few Megaparsecs), the redshift primarily indicates the era from which the photon originates, rather than the specific path it took. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the concept, ignoring the potential for path dependence. Option B overstates the practical significance of path dependence in cosmological observations. Option D incorrectly reverses the scales at which path dependence might be more or less significant.\n\nIt's important to note that while path dependence can theoretically occur, especially in cases of strong gravitational lensing by rapidly moving objects, observing such phenomena is highly improbable and has not been experimentally confirmed.

My recommendation is to use `./config --prefix=/usr/local shared` (notice the space before \"shared\") so that it installs there (and builds the shared library, `libssl`), rather than its own private subdirectory. If you do not do this, you will have to add a file to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` with `/usr/local/ssl/lib` in it (see below for the significance of `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` files), and add `/usr/local/bin` to `$PATH`.\n\n---\n\nYou will need to run `ldconfig` after `make install` to add the libraries to the linker cache. If that doesn't work, read on.\n\n`make install` probably by default went to `/usr/local`, which *should* take precedence but may not. You can thus leave your distro's openssl install to avoid messing around with the package manager and prereqs, but still use your own locally built version as the default. To check:\n\n```\nldd $(which ssh) | grep libssl\n\n```\n\nIf you get no output, your `ssh` was statically linked and needs to be rebuilt (see Anton's answer). Otherwise, this should point to your `/usr/local` version. If it points to something else:\n\n```\nldconfig -p | grep libssl\n\n```\n\nThe `/usr/local` version should be shown, but after some other one. If so, skip down to \"/usr/local/lib does not have precedence\" below. If not, make sure `/usr/local` is in the linker path generally:\n\n```\nldconfig -p | grep \"/usr/local\"\n\n```\n\nIf not, `grep -r \"/usr/local\" /etc/ld.so.conf.d`. If that is not there, add a file to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` called `00-local.conf` with one line:\n\n```\n/usr/local/lib\n\n```\n\nRun `ldconfig` (no switches) and go through this again.\n\n---\n\n/usr/local/lib does not have precedence\n=======================================\n\nFind the linker cache config file where the path is added:\n\n```\ngrep -r \"/usr/local\" /etc/ld.so.conf.d\n\n```\n\nIf it's not there, you'll have to add a file as explained above. Presuming it is, the problem is the files are processed lexicographically. E.g., if the content of `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` is:\n\n```\naddtheselibraries.conf\nlibc.conf\n\n```\n\nAnd `libc.conf` contains `/usr/local/lib` but `addtheselibraries.conf` contains, e.g. `/usr/lib`,1 then the latter will take precedence. If the `/usr/local/lib` file doesn't contain anything else, just rename it with something which will supersede the other files; numbers go first so `000-whatever` is good.\n\nBecause you have complete control over `/usr/local/lib`, it *should* take precedence over any paths used by the distro package manager (and usually does).\n\n1\\. /usr/lib is a default compiled into the linker, but it and other standard system places (/lib, etc) are added *last*, which allows you to supersede them. Because of these, sometimes (e.g.) `/usr/lib` is added to a .conf file in order to make it supersede some other .conf file."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: After installing a new version of OpenSSL from source on a Linux system, you find that the system is still using the old version.

The name \"Leppa\" is an anagram of \"Apple\".\nB) Watmel Berry is correctly matched with Watermelon. This is a straightforward naming connection.\nD) Haban Berry is correctly matched with its inspiration. While not a common fruit, it's based on a Japanese citrus fruit called Terihabanjir\u014d.\n\nC) is incorrect because Pamtre Berry is actually based on a Palm tree, not a Pomegranate.

Using the --cask option with brew install will install mpv as a proper macOS application, placing it in the /Applications folder and allowing it to run more like a typical app than a command-line tool.\nD) While this might make the binary accessible, it wouldn't create a proper macOS application bundle with all necessary components.\n\nThe key here is understanding the difference between command-line installations and application (cask) installations in Homebrew, and knowing the current best practices for installing GUI applications on macOS using Homebrew."}}
