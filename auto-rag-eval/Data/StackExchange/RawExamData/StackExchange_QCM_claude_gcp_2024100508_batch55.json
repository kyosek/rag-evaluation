Why does $dR/R\\=\\-2/100$ (negative for shrinks)? Is $4\\\\%$ unity change? I mean $dg/g\\=4\\\\%$ or $dg\\=4\\\\%$\n\nI'm primarily interested in the general case of notation of the form $dy/y$ for arbitrary $y$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the example $dR$ means \"change in $R$\" and $dg$ means \"change in $g$\". In particular in this case you start with a radius $R$, which then changes to some other value $R'\\=R\\+dR$. This change thus causes a change in $g$, which becomes $g'\\=g\\+dg$. \n\nSo now, if $R$ shrinks by $2\\\\%$, this means that $R' \\= R\\-0\\.02\\\\times R$, which in terms of the change gives $dR \\= \\-0\\.02R$ or equivalently $dR/R\\=\\-0\\.02\\=2/100$.\n\nTo answer your other question, it is $dg/g\\=4\\\\%$. This follows from the algebra that they do in the example. Notice that it can't be $dg\\=4\\\\%$ because $4\\\\%\\=0\\.04$ is just a number with no dimension, while $dg$ being a change in $g$ must have the same units of $g$, that is those of an acceleration. \n\nIn general, whenever you find an expression of the form $dy/y$ that is comparing the change in $y$ to $y$ itself. This notation with differentials is meant to emphasise the fact that the changes are small compared to the quantities involved (that is for example $dR$ is much smaller than $R$, because it is only $2\\\\%$ of it). For this reason they're using calculus to get to the result."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A cylindrical water tank has a radius R and height h. The volume V of the tank is given by V = \u03c0R\u00b2h. If the radius R increases by 3% and the height h decreases by 2%, approximately what percentage change occurs in the volume V?\n\nA) Increase of 4%\nB) Decrease of 1%\nC) Increase of 5%\nD) Decrease of 5%\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this, we can use the concept of small changes and the notation dV/V to represent the fractional change in volume.\n\n1) For small changes, we can approximate:\n   dV/V \u2248 2(dR/R) + dh/h\n\n2) We're given:\n   dR/R = +3% = +0.03\n   dh/h = -2% = -0.02\n\n3) Substituting these values:\n   dV/V \u2248 2(0.03) + (-0.02)\n        \u2248 0.06 - 0.02\n        \u2248 0.04\n\n4) This 0.04 represents a 4% increase in volume.\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately represents the approximate percentage change in volume.

I literally cannot grasp the concept of what proper time is and I have no idea why. There's something I'm missing here.\n\nIf someone is standing on earth and there's a clock next to him in the same reference frame, and then there's someone in a spaceship traveling at $0\\.5c$ away from the earth with another clock in the frame of the ship, then from the view of the earth the clock on the ship will run slow. I get that.\n\nBut who measures proper time? I don't get it at all. The definition given everywhere makes no sense to me. My book says that the proper time interval is \"the time interval between two events measured by an observer who sees the events occur at the same point in space.\" At **what** same point in space? For whom? What does this even mean at all? Can both the observer on earth and the observer in the space ship **both** have a proper time? By the time dilation formula it's obvious that it refers to the *minimum* time that's possible I guess. Would one the proper time in the ship be the improper time on earth? Would the proper time on earth be the improper time on the ship? \n\nI'm literally hitting my desk just not being able to understand this and not getting a clear answer from **anywhere**.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the scenario you present, only the observer holding the clock can measure the elapse of its proper time. The moving observer observes *his own* proper time elapse by looking at the clock that he is holding.

In this scenario, the Earth observer measures their proper time using their clock, and the spaceship observer measures their proper time using their clock. Neither can directly measure the proper time of the other's clock, but they can calculate it using time dilation formulas.

Both triacs and relays have potential failure modes that could result in uncontrolled current flow, which could be dangerous in a system controlling water and heat. Triacs can fail shorted, while relay contacts can become welded together. However, this risk isn't unique to either component and can be mitigated by using a non-resettable thermal fuse.

Nevertheless, I will leave the question as stated in case it continues to receive interesting answers.\n\n### Justification\n\nThis coming academic year I will be supervising a fourth\\-year undergraduate project on Category Theory. As should be clear to MO regulars, I'm far from an expert in this topic, but I am keen to improve my fluency in this language: hence the project.\n\nMaybe it's only me, but I find that the unifying beauty of category theory can best be appreciated when one has lots of concrete (not necessarily in the categorical sense!) examples. Most books I've seen take this view as well and present a number of examples taken from algebra and topology, mostly. Given the origins of the subject, this is of course not surprising. From time to time, though, I find myself wanting more \"realistic\" examples for certain concepts. This question is about one such concept.\n\n### Background\n\nRecall that a *bimorphism* in a category is a morphism which is both monic (i.e., left cancellable) and epic (i.e., right cancellable). A closely related notion to (and, in a concrete category, a special case of) bimorphism is that of isomorphism: a morphism $f:A \\\\to B$ is an isomorphism if there exists a morphism $f^{\\-1}: B \\\\to A$ such that $f \\\\circ f^{\\-1} \\= 1\\_B$ and $f^{\\-1} \\\\circ f \\= 1\\_A$, with $1\\_{A,B}$ the corresponding identity morphisms. Categories in which all bimorphisms are isomorphisms are said to be *balanced*.\n\nWe say that two objects $A,B$ in a category are isomorphic if $\\\\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ contains an isomorphism. Now, if the category is not balanced, it could very well be that $\\\\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ contains a bimorphism even if it does not contain an isomorphism. For lack of a better name, let us call such objects *bimorphic* and let us speak of bimorphism classes of objects,...\n\nNeedless to say, the concept of isomorphism classes is very important and sits at the centre of any classification problem, but what about the concept of bimorphism classes?\n\n### Question\n\nIs there a natural context in which one is compelled to relax the notion of isomorphism to that of bimorphism? In particular, any geometric context?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to be deliberately provocative and say that I don't really know of *any* use for the concept of bimorphism as such. (I also don't really like the name; it sounds to me like something that's both a morphism and a comorphism.)\n\nOne use that's been proposed is \"to find situations in which bimorphism \u21d2 isomorphism.\" Such situations may be interesting, but as far as I can tell they are rarely (if ever) used. What seems to happen much more often is that we have some factorization system (E,M) and we use the fact that E\\+M\\=iso, which is true for any factorization system. The most common case is probably (extremal epi, mono), followed perhaps by (epi, extremal mono); both of these are factorization systems as soon as the relevant factorizations exist.\n\nIt might *happen*, in some case, that E consists of exactly the epimorphisms and M of exactly the monomorphisms (such as when all epis, or all monos, are extremal). But as far as I can tell this fact \\-\\- especially the epi part of it \\-\\- is hardly ever relevant, because in practice it's quite hard to characterize the epis in a given category or to check that a given morphism is epi, nor is the answer often especially meaningful. Since monadic functors also create limits, and in particular monomorphisms, a morphism in a category monadic over Set is monic iff it is injective \\-\\- but this is not true for epis, and even in quite nice categories the epis can be fairly bizarre. It's usually the extremal epis which coincide with the \"surjections\" and form a factorization system with the monos.\n\nFor instance, Andrew cited vector spaces as an example of a balanced category. But as I pointed out in my comment, do we ever use that fact? What we actually teach our undergraduates is that injective\\+surjective\\=iso for vector spaces; we (or, at least, I) don't tell them anything about why surjective\\=epi, or even what epi means. And when doing linear algebra, I might occasionally use the fact that surjections are in particular epi (which just follows because the forgetful functor to Set is faithful), but never the converse. It's just as true for groups, rings, fields, monoids, etc. that injective\\+surjective\\=iso, and we use that fact in doing algebra all the time \\-\\- but does the non\\-surjective ring epimorphism Z \u2192 Q, showing that rings (unlike vector spaces) are not balanced, ever actually bother us in practice?\n\nIn the topological situation, it's true that the epimorphisms in Top are precisely the surjective continuous maps. But does that fact really help you when looking for conditions ensuring that a continuous bijection is an isomorphism, or using that fact in practice? Odds are the property of a continuous bijection you're going to use is that it's continuous and a bijection, not that it's monic and epic in the category Top.\n\nThe categorical version of \"continuous bijection in Top\" is \"inverted by the forgetful functor to Set,\" and I think that in general the property of \"being inverted by a forgetful functor\" is quite interesting and important. For instance, a forgetful functor with the property that any morphism inverted by it is already an isomorphism is called *conservative*, and these include all monadic functors. The question about all the different topologies one can put on a given set also seems to me to really be about morphisms inverted by the forgetful functor; is it really important here that continuous surjections are the epis in Top? I expect that if you modify the definition of Top a little, then it may no longer be true that epis coincide with continuous surjections, and in that case I bet that it is the continuous surjections which are of more interest.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the most interesting thing I know about bimorphisms is that they often form the middle class of a [ternary factorization system](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/07/ternary_factorization_systems.html). I'll be happy to be proven wrong, however."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In category theory, which of the following statements about bimorphisms is most accurate?\n\nA) Bimorphisms are widely used and essential for understanding the structure of most categories.\n\nB) The concept of bimorphism classes is as important as isomorphism classes in classification problems.\n\nC) Bimorphisms are primarily useful in identifying balanced categories, where all bimorphisms are isomorphisms.\n\nD) The notion of bimorphism is often less practical or relevant than other concepts like factorization systems or morphisms inverted by forgetful functors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The answer is D because the documentation argues that bimorphisms, while a defined concept in category theory, are not particularly useful or commonly applied in practice. The author suggests that other concepts, such as factorization systems (e.g., (extremal epi, mono) or (epi, extremal mono)) and morphisms inverted by forgetful functors, are more frequently used and meaningful in categorical analysis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text actually argues against the widespread use and essential nature of bimorphisms. \n\nOption B is not supported by the documentation, which implies that isomorphism classes are far more central to classification problems than bimorphism classes.\n\nOption C, while mentioning a true property of balanced categories, oversimplifies the utility of bimorphisms. The text suggests that even in balanced categories like vector spaces, the concept of bimorphism is not explicitly used or taught.\n\nThe correct answer, D, aligns with the author's main argument that bimorphisms are often less practical or relevant than other categorical concepts, and that properties like injectivity and surjectivity (which relate to forgetful functors) are more commonly used in practice than the categorical notions of monic and epic."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/16", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/590915", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/247938/"], "docs_id": 590915, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Currently I am learning about decoupling circuits for noise suppression and decoupling of digital ICs.

So the question is, is it worth the trouble?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Important question: in the first example, where does the code that enforces the business invariant live?\n\nThe first approach looks simple and straight forward because all the hard stuff has been moved somewhere else!\n\nSo, in order:\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is bad, because the constraint on the list of users has been moved outside the entity.\n\n```\nuser.getOrders().add(invariantViolatingOrder);\n\n```\n\nYour second approach is better, but still has problems\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return new new ReadOnlyCollection<Order>(_orders);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis protects the collection against change, but it doesn't protect the Order's from being changed in a way that violates the invariant.\n\n```\nuser.getOrders().getOrder(2).invariantViolatingChange();\n\n```\n\nThe order entity can enforce an invariant of its own state, but it can't enforce an invariant of the combined state. (Contrived example: this particular user is only allowed $20 dollars of orders. You have to check the entire collection to verify that it's ok to change this one order).\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that an invariant is enforced at every point that changes the state of an entity, is to make sure there is only one place where the state can be changed, and enforce it there. In OO terms, this is \"encapsulation\".\n\n```\npublic User \n{\n    public IList<Order> Orders\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            // By returning a copy of the state, we ensure that nothing\n            // outside the user can change its state.\n            IList<Order> readOnly = new List<Order>();\n\n            for (Order o : _orders) {\n                // Turtles all the way down: this depends on the order\n                // providing copies of its own state.\n                readOnly.add(o.clone());\n            }\n\n            return readOnly ;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnother possibility is to treat the internal state of an entity as an immutable value type. Getting *immutable* state is perfectly fine, because there's no way that the immutable state can be used to violate the business invariant.\n\nBut again, this second solution is turtles all the way down; you have to be careful about including entities in a value object."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented design, which approach best ensures that business invariants are consistently enforced when dealing with collections of child entities within a parent entity?\n\nA) Using public getter and setter methods for the collection property\nB) Implementing a read-only property that returns a new ReadOnlyCollection<T> of the internal list\nC) Returning a deep copy of the internal collection with cloned objects\nD) Using a public IList<T> property with automatic getter and setter\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nOption A (public getter/setter) allows direct modification of the collection, potentially violating invariants.\nOption B (ReadOnlyCollection) prevents modification of the collection itself but doesn't protect individual items from being changed.\nOption C (deep copy with cloned objects) provides the strongest protection by ensuring that neither the collection nor its items can be modified externally.\nOption D (public IList property) is similar to A and offers no protection for invariants.\n\nThe correct answer, C, best maintains encapsulation and ensures that business rules are enforced within the entity itself, preventing external code from inadvertently violating invariants."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/18", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/354136", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/59745/"], "docs_id": 354136, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking for a word for a murder of a co\\-conspirator or witness in order to preclude testimony to the authorities.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Many suspect that Fat Tony's apparent fatal accident on the New Jersey\n>  Turnpike was in fact a *\\[word]* perpetrated by other members of the\n>  Soho Heist team.\n\n**Update** I know the verb *to silence*, and I was hoping for a snappy noun for, basically, \"killing to silence.\" An *ad hoc* construction becomes unwieldy in my actual usage, which deals with statistics.

In bash, sourcing a script with arguments is supported, so \"$NAME\" is passed to install.sh and echoed. However, in sh (or dash), sourcing a script ignores arguments, and $1 refers to arguments of the main script. If main.sh is run without arguments in sh, nothing is echoed.

As clustering labels do not carry any meaning across clustering periods, I want to re\\-assign the labels in 'clustering\\_period\\_2'.\n\nMethod: I want to figure out for each clustering output of period 1 and period 2, how often a combination has occurred, e.g. how often was an observation assigned to cluster 1 in period 1, and cluster 5 in period 2\\. I do this using the pivot\\_table function:\n\n```\n    df.pivot_table(index='cluster', columns='cluster_2', values='name', aggfunc='count')\n\n```\n\nI then want to find the maximum value in the 'pivot table':\n\n```\n    cluster_period_2   0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n    cluster_period_1                              \n    0                  51  43  50  49  32  36  33\n    1                  26  28  17  34  25  28  30\n    2                  34  47  35  33  37  36  34\n    3                   7   6   2   5   7   5   6\n    4                  30  19  24  26  20  18  20\n    5                   3  11   5   6   4   6   3\n    6                   4   2   1  13   2   4   3\n\n```\n\nIn this example, this would be 51, which implies that cluster\\_0\\_period\\_1 is now cluster\\_0\\_in\\_period\\_2\\. Then, I want to find the next largest value not in an already used column and row, i.e. not in row 0 or column 0\\.

When I design with 5/5 track/clearance my pours often also become 5 or 8 clearance, because I know the fabs I use can do it at a price I am willing to pay and I know I will have taken care of larger gaps only where they are needed.\n\n((I changed my wording to reflect what I think you mean. More usually planes are used to refer to the dedicated copper planes inside a multilayer PCB where no tracks run through them, where a pour is the copper areas you have on the signal layers of a given potential, such as a ground pour or VCC pour))\n\nIf you have no signals or pads that need to be further away from a ground pour for signal or thermal reasons or you know you have defined special rules for just those occasions, you can just set the general rule to 8 thou/mil as well. If you may have those signals and can't be sure everything takes that into account and on the other hand don't need to isolate your tracks from each other, you can keep it at 12, 15 or whatever.\n\nGenerally having ground between tracks can do little harm (unless the tracks it creeps between are characteristically coupled, like wired network, USB, RS485, etc) and often even improves things, especially if you do not have an actual ground plane on an internal layer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a PCB for an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller and needs to determine the appropriate clearance between the ground pour and signal traces.

Presence or absence of internal ground planes\n5. Thermal considerations for certain components\n\nThe engineer must balance these factors to choose an appropriate clearance.

The main pieces (seat, back, sides, etc) are assembled and I'm supposed to just screw the pieces together. How are you supposed to tighten these things? There's nowhere to use a screwdriver to hold it in place when tightening the nuts. The holes aren't big enough for the bolts to go in flush, and they're tight enough that I'm having to screw the bolts to get them to go all the way in.

The idea with carriage bolts is that you pound them in with a hammer so that the square part under the head of the bolt is forced down into the tight hole in the wood. This provides the hold to a) keep the bolt in place during assembly and b) to keep the bolt from turning while using a wrench or socket to tighten the nut from the end of the bolt.\n\nCarriage bolts are designed so that on one side of an assembly that there are no protruding bits for things to catch on. The rounded head will provide that as opposed to there being a hex or square head sticking out. In your case with a chair kit the general idea is that the heads of the carriage bolts should face toward the side of the chair where the user will be.

This forces the square part under the bolt head into the tight wood hole, which serves two purposes: it keeps the bolt in place during assembly and prevents it from turning while tightening the nut. The tight fit is intentional and should not be altered by drilling larger holes. The rounded head of the carriage bolt should face the user side of the furniture for safety and aesthetics, with the threaded end and nut on the less visible or used side.

Does not seem so to me since the motor driver is so large, but I admit I am inexperienced in this area.\n\nWhat are other options without using a printed PCB?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absolutely, yes. But you'll need a frontend.\n\nAn EKG is usually just an instrumentation amplifier or a multistage amplifier with as many dB of common mode rejection as you can get.\n\nThe problem is that people are bags of electrolyte\\-rich fluids and meat with that right combination of resistance on the outside (skin) and relatively lower impedance to AC signals that all sorts of radiated EMI couples into our skin all the time.\n\nIf you've ever accidentally touched the tip of a speaker jack with your finger, or heck, just try probing your finger with your oscilloscope (isn't that the first thing one does with a new scope? I know it is for me!), you'll see what I mean. There is probably a volt or 2 of 50Hz or 60Hz ripple just from the wiring in your house.\n\nThis presents a problem when trying to detect electrical signals originating deep inside the skin\\-enclosed meat sack with all that noise coupling right at the surface trying to drown it out.\n\nWhere that noisy garbage coupling into your skin is on the order of a volt or two, the signals from your heart (at the point of detection on your skin at least) are about 1mV peak to peak. To get a good waveform, you'll want to be able to clearly see peaks as low as 20\u00b5V.\n\nSo you can't use an oscilloscope unaided, you can certainly use one as a very effective ECG/EKG with a front\\-end.\n\nSuch a front\\-end is not particularly difficult to make. The bandwidth and frequency of signals from the human heart are... quite slow in the context of analog electronics. This makes a frontend particularly forgiving, and you can even build one on a breadboard with just one IC.\n\nEssentially, it all boils down to two things: You need a lot of gain, and a lot of common mode rejection.\n\nCommon mode rejection is achieved by, at the simplest, coupling the op amp's ground reference to your own body through a low (but not too low) resistor, like 100\u03a9. This is the lead that tends to connect far away from your chest, like at the angle or leg. This ensures only the noise gets picked up and rejected as common mode, leaving the cardiac signal (which are far too weak to matter that far away in your ankle or where ever).\n\nA higher performance way of achieving this is to actually use a second op amp to drive the ground reference (your skin) and actively cancel out most of the common mode noise.\n\nIf you search for 'ECG frontend circuit', you'll find quite a few complete schematics of varying simplicity or complexity.\n\nAny of them can work, but it ultimately depends on what level of performance is acceptable.\n\nI have personally made this one, and a different similar one that also used a right leg driver that I can't seem to find, and both exceeded my expectations. They worked quite well:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBQHF.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBQHF.png)\n\n**Safety Note**\n\nDo not attach anything connected to your body like this to an oscilloscope that plugs directly into the wall. You ***must*** use an isolation transformer to fully isolate the oscilloscope so no ground path can be taken through you (and probably the electrical conduction system of your heart). Real ECGs are fully isolated if they plug into the wall at all.\n\n**Final note: Your body doesn't run on electric currents.**\n\nIt runs on ionic current. Electric current has electrons as the charge carriers making up that current, but inside your body, it is positive ions rather than electrons that flow and do things like make your muscles move.\n\nFor that reason, you need to use some sort of electrolyte between an electrode and your skin, forming a half cell and allowing the ionic currents to be converted into electric currents for use with your ECG frontend.\n\nBuying proper medical electrodes is ideal, but I can personally attest that tinfoil with some shampoo smeared on it can work in a pinch if you are really impatient to test what you made. Your results may vary.\n\nUse an isolation transformer and don't get hurt or killed accidentally. Beyond that, this is actually a great project that isn't too hard or expensive to build if you're sufficiently interested and motivated.

A single line of wiring connecting bathroom geyser caught fire and got burnt. I am planning to rewire my house again.\n\nShould I be getting my entire home rewired with copper wiring or only the part which got burnt? Apart from high cost of copper wiring what other advantage I would be getting?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This doesn't sound like a technical question. You didn't maintain the AL wiring properly... it had a problem... should you replace it? The real question is do you trust yourself to maintain it going forward?\n\nSame exact thing probably would've happened with copper.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI do systems rollouts within enterprises, where you get employees to switch to a new business system. People don't like change. New systems don't fit old ways. It was much worse in the 60s\\-70s when the first automation was happening *and many failed, for many reasons*. In most cases using Sperry vs Burroughs vs IBM made no difference \\- employees were uncooperative, management didn't listen, etc. If a company bought IBM, then management *presumed the computer was OK* and confronted their internal problems. But if they bought Burroughs, they'd take the easy out of blaming Burroughs. So if you were responsible for picking vendor, you picked IBM.\n\nThat's called a \"Halo Effect\".\n\nSame with copper wiring. The same exact problem happens in 2 different junction boxes. If it's copper wire, \"it was a mistorqued screw\". But if it's aluminum, \"OMG it's the aluminum wire\" and that's as far as people's brains go.\n\nSo that's most likely what happened there, if it was copper, it still would've failed owing to faulty workmanship, and it wouldn't even occur to you to rewire your whole house because if it lol. And by the way, the wire didn't burn up, the wire termination (end) did.\n\nIn reality, it's copper lugs. They do not play well with aluminum wire. Aluminum lugs work well with both, which is why they are widely used: Tear apart an Alumiconn; *it's made of aluminum*. Ditto a Mac Block, ground bar, and many panel lugs.\n\nBut aluminum wire is not *better* than copper; you can still *screw it up* in all the usual ways. We just have to add \"failing to use Al\\-rated terminations\" to the mix.\n\nMy Rx for aluminum wire\n-----------------------\n\nFirst, you fit arc\\-fault protection (usually at the circuit breaker). That will catch many/most of the kinds of failure we worry about with Al wire.\n\nThen, you visit every connection point and make sure it has terminations rated for Al wire. That means (in the US) CO\\-ALR receps, Alumiconns, MAC Blocks connectors etc. (and I dislike purple wire nuts because *it's not that simple*; you do need to physically separate Al and Cu wires, and there are lots of pix of melted and charred purple wire nuts.) And in cases where you must attach to equipment not available with CO\\-ALR termination, you pigtail to copper for the last 6 inches."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner with aluminum wiring experiences a fire in their bathroom geyser wiring.

The documentation suggests that the issue is likely not inherent to aluminum wiring itself, but rather improper maintenance or installation. \n\nKey points supporting this answer:\n1. The expert states that the same problem could have occurred with copper wiring.\n2. The focus should be on proper maintenance and installation rather than the wire material.\n3. Specific recommendations are provided for aluminum wiring, including:\n   - Installing arc-fault protection\n   - Ensuring all connection points have terminations rated for aluminum wire\n   - Using appropriate connectors (e.g., Alumiconns, MAC Blocks)\n   - Pigtailing to copper for equipment without CO-ALR termination\n\nOption A is excessive and doesn't address the root cause.

This can be proven by reducing the subset sum problem with target zero to this problem. \n\nThe reduction works as follows:\n1. Given a set of integers {x\u2081, ..., x\u2099}, we want to find a nonempty subset that sums to zero.\n2. We can transform this into our complex number problem by setting z\u2096 = exp(2\u03c0i(x\u2096/a)), where a = |x\u2081| + ... + |x\u2099| + 1.\n3. There exists a choice of z\u2096's that achieves the maximum value of 1 if and only if the corresponding nonempty subset of integers sums to 0.\n\nThis reduction shows that if we could solve our complex number problem efficiently, we could also solve the subset sum problem efficiently.

The top answer indicates that the most likely cause is that the Overpass API server being used is down. This can be verified by checking the platform status. The solution suggested is to try other Overpass API instances, assuming QGIS allows configuration of the server address. This directly corresponds to option B in our question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a faulty internet connection could cause issues, it's not the most likely cause given the specific error described.\nOption C is incorrect because although using an updated version of software is generally good practice, the error is not specifically related to the QGIS version.\nOption D is incorrect because there's no indication of plugin corruption, and reinstalling the plugin wouldn't address the server-side issue described."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/06/04", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/316646", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/13980/"], "docs_id": 316646, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my view, when we talk about someone doing something in the past, we often use \"what he did **was**...\", \"what he ate **was**...\", etc.\n\nI think most of the time it should be used with past tense.\n\nBut I think it can be used with present tense, too when it means \"is considered to be.\"\n\nFor example,\n\n**Example 1**\n\n> What he did was killing animals.\n\nSimply tells us that he killed animals.\n\n> What he did is killing animals.\n\n\"Now, the thing he did is considered to be killing animals \"\n\nA possible context:\n\n> What he did was killing animals.

I understand, however, your objective.\n\n> What he did was killing animals\n\nis a clunky but grammatical way to say\n\n> He killed animals\n\nor\n\n> What he did was to kill animals\n\nI am not saying that you can never have a past and present combined\n\n> What he did is still killing animals\n\nis perfectly grammatical. And that is how most people will interpret\n\n> What he did is killing animals.\n\nThey will view that sentence as describing a past act with current consequences.\n\nSo I am **NOT** saying that we have a grammatical rule against having past and present in the same sentence. I am talking about meaning, both intended and received.\n\n> What he did is the killing of animals\n\nis a way, grammatical but in my opinion obscure, to convey\n\n> What he did is now considered to be the killing of animals.\n\nMy point is that when a participle is used as a gerund, that is a noun as indicated by the article \u201cthe,\u201d no time aspect is involved. Nouns do not have tense. But your meaning that current views consider what he did to be the killing of animals (with the implication that views at the time of the killing were different) is lost by the use of the gerund alone.\n\nThe purpose of language is to convey meaning. That requires more than being grammatical.\n\n**EDIT**: This edit relates to the original poster\u2019s comment to my original answer.\n\nIn general, if you want to be clear about changing meanings, you seldom do it through tense or other grammatical devices **ALONE**. People will almost always understand what you speak or write by the meanings current when heard or read unless you explicitly make clear that you are talking about a difference in meaning.\n\nYou can use purely grammatical means as a rhetorical device.\n\n> What graft is is not what graft was.\n\nThat is grammatical but obscure on its own. It is fine, however, as an introductory sentence.\n\n> What graft is is not what graft was. Boss Croker obviously had neither ethical nor legal reservations about what he called \u201chonest graft.\u201d Legal and ethical standards have changed since the late 19th century. Little if any of his \u201chonest graft\u201d would be deemed ethical in North America in the 21st century, and some would be outright illegal.\n\nEnglish is a subtle language, but complicated ideas about changing mores are not best expressed by tinkering with tenses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between grammar and conveying meaning when discussing past actions using \"what he did is/was\" constructions?\n\nA) Using \"what he did is\" instead of \"what he did was\" is always grammatically correct when describing past actions.\n\nB) The grammatical correctness of a sentence is the most important factor in effectively conveying meaning about past actions.\n\nC) Purely grammatical means are the best way to express complex ideas about changing interpretations of past actions.\n\nD) Being grammatically correct is necessary but not always sufficient to clearly convey intended meaning, especially for nuanced ideas about past actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The top answer emphasizes that while sentences like \"What he did is killing animals\" can be grammatically correct, they may not effectively convey the intended meaning about how past actions are viewed in the present.

Last one I played was Pok\u00e9mon Yellow on my Gameboy.\n\nEver since then, a lot has changed in the Pok\u00e9mon World. I've tried going through Bulbapedia and Pok\u00e9mon Wikia, but still find there's a lot of new stuff, which just seems confusing:\n\nBreeding, Wifi, items, etc.\n\nAnyway, can anyone give me the main pointers to update myself for playing these games? Or links to the basic information which I definitively should know in order to enjoy it?\n\nAlso, can I catch the dear Pok\u00e9mons from previous versions in the wild or via special events? (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, etc.)\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a brief overview of some of the major mechanic changes (with links to Bulbapedia in the header of each section):\n\n**[Special](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_move) / [Physical](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Physical_move) Split**:  \n\nRaven Dreamer already covered this very well in [his answer](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/12601/pokemon-generation-iv-platinum-pearl-diamond-whats-new-since-gameboy-versio/12602#12602), but basically, instead of the type of the move distinguishing whether it's a special or physical attack, it's now based on the attack itself. (For example, Fire Punch is now a physical move, as punching is a physical action).\n\n**[Breeding](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Breeding)**:  \n\nSince Generation II, you can breed two Pok\u00e9mon to obtain a Pok\u00e9mon egg, which will hatch into a Pok\u00e9mon. To breed them, you must put a female and a male (or any gender and Ditto) in the Day Care, and leave them. However, these Pok\u00e9mon must belong to the same [Egg Group](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Egg_group) in order for anything to happen. The Pok\u00e9mon that hatches from the egg will be the female Pok\u00e9mon you put in the Day Care, or the Pok\u00e9mon that isn't Ditto. The male Pok\u00e9mon is in charge of passing down attacks to the offspring. They can pass down any move that the offspring would be able to learn by level\\-up, TM, and certain [Egg Moves](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Egg_moves) (attacks that can't normally be learned by the offspring by either former method, but are programmed in as Egg Moves). Now, there are a **gigantic** amount of other mechanics behind breeding (ie. how the game determines what [IVs](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/IVs) to pass on, what nature to pass on, etc.), but you should probably just read the Bulbapedia article linked.\n\n**New Types**:  \n\nDisgruntledGoat touched on this in [his answer](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/12601/pokemon-generation-iv-platinum-pearl-diamond-whats-new-since-gameboy-versio/12616#12616) , but I'll mention it shortly here. Generation II introduced the [Dark](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dark_(type)) and [Steel](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Steel_(type)) types. Dark types were created to counter the overpowered Psychic types, and the Steel type was introduced as a defensive typing (the only type resistant to Dragon, as Generation II added Dragon attacks other than Dragon Rage). Magnemite and Magneton became Electric / Steel from Electric (the only type change between generations).\n\n**New Attacks:**  \n\nI suppose this is a bit of a given, but there are many attacks that have been added to the Pok\u00e9mon series. In addition, Game Freak occasionally changes the properties of certain moves between generations, generally to balance the game. For example, the attack [High Jump Kick](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi_Jump_Kick_(move)) has had many changes since it was made. It was a 85 base power move in Generation I, II, and III. In Generation I, the user takes 1 HP damage if the attack misses. In Generation II or III, the user takes half the damage it would have done if the attack misses. The damage of High Jump Kick was increased from 85 to 100 in Generation IV, and again from 100 to 130 in Generation V. However, in Generation V the PP of it was reduced from 20 to 10 and the recoil damage from missing is half of the user's health.\n\n**[Natures](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Natures)**:  \n\nSpeaking of Natures, Generation III introduced natures, which basically modify a Pok\u00e9mon's stat. There are 5 neutral natures, and 20 natures which increase one stat by 10% and decrease another by 10% (one nature for each possibly). For example, if I took two Pikachu with the exact same IV spread: one Bashful (neutral nature) and one Lonely (\\+Attack, \\-Defense), and trained them the exact same way (to ensure the EVs were the same), the Lonely one would have 10% more Attack and 10% less Defense than the Bashful one. In addition, Nature also determines what flavours of Pok\u00e9block / Poffin a Pok\u00e9mon likes / dislikes.\n\n**[IVs (Individual Values)](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/IVs)**:  \n\nThis particular change doesn't really concern casual Pok\u00e9mon players (heck, most people probably don't even know what IVs are), but instead of IVs being able to be 0 \\- 15 (as they were in Generation I and II), they can now be anywhere from 0 \\- 31 (Generation III and on).\n\n**[EVs (Effort Values)](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values)**:  \n\nYet another mechanic that is invisible to the player but exists. Generation I had an EV system (at that time known as Stat Experience) where defeating a Pokemon gave the EVs of it's base stats, and the difference between a level 100 trained Pokemon's stats and a level 100 untrained Pokemon's stats was `(\u221aStat Experience) / 4`. Since Generation III, each Pokemon has an EV value assigned to it (Zubat has 1 speed EV), and defeating the Pokemon gave that amount of EVs. While the maximum gain per stat has remained the same (up to 63 points higher on a fully trained Pok\u00e9mon), the total number of EV points a single Pok\u00e9mon has been capped to 127 total EVs in Generation III and on. More information in the article.\n\n**[Hold Items](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hold_item)**:  \n\nIn Generation I games, you could use items but not let your Pok\u00e9mon hold them. However, since Generation II, you can now let your Pok\u00e9mon hold items. The effects from these items could be anywhere from healing your Pok\u00e9mon if they get low on health to raising the power of certain moves.\n\n**[Abilities](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Abilities)**:\nAbilities were introduced in Generation III. Each Pok\u00e9mon species has one or two abilities programmed in (and occasionally a third [Dream World](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Abilities) ability in the case of [Generation V](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_V)). Abilities can have effects in battle (such as Intimidate which lowers the opponents Attack upon switching in) and sometimes outside of battle (Compoundeyes raises the chance of a wild Pok\u00e9mon holding an item by 50%).\n\n**[Double Battles](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Double_battle) and [Triple Battles](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Triple_battle)**:\nGeneration III added Double Battles, where you send out two Pok\u00e9mon and the opponent does the same. When you attack, you get to chose which Pok\u00e9mon to target, and some moves will target multiple Pok\u00e9mon (for example, Rock Side hits both of your opponent's Pok\u00e9mon). Generation V added Triple Battles, which is similar to Double Battle except for the obvious difference that each trainer uses three Pok\u00e9mon. The left Pok\u00e9mon cannot attack the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon on the right side, and vice versa.\n\n**[Time of Day System](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time)**:  \n\nGeneration II introduced a time of day system, adding another level of realism to the game. Certain events are only triggered at certain times of day \\- for example, wild Hoothoot only appear at night and certain police officers in\\-game will only challenge you at night.\n\n**[Day of the Week System](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time)**  \n\nIn addition to the day and night system, Generation II also added a day of week system, where certain events are only triggered on certain days (for example, you can only enter the Bug Catching contest in HeartGold and SoulSilver on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays).\n\n**[Seasons](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Seasons)**:  \n\nGeneration V (yet to be released outside of Japan) built on the last two systems yet again, and added in a season system. The entire overworld changes it's appearance at different seasons, and certain areas become inaccessible / accessible at certain times of the year. Each season lasts one month, so all the seasons will appear 3 times a real year. Spring occurs in January, May, and September, Summer in February, June, and October, Autumn in March, July, and November, and Winter in April, August, and December.\n\n**[Pok\u00e9mon Contest](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Contest) / [Pok\u00e9mon Super Contest](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Super_Contest) / [Pok\u00e9athalon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokeathalons) / [Pok\u00e9mon Musical](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Musical)**  \n\nSince Generation III, there have been various events that you could partake in if you wanted to take a break from battling. Ruby and Sapphire introduced the Pok\u00e9mon Contest: a two\\-stage event where your Pok\u00e9mon is first judged on various characteristics (beauty, cuteness, coolness, smartness, or toughness) that can be improved by feeding them [Pok\u00e9blocks](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokeblocks) \\- an item created from blended berries. The second stage consists of your Pok\u00e9mon using it's attacks to impress the judges (different attacks have different appeal levels and secondary effects).\n\nDiamond and Pearl improved on this with the Pok\u00e9mon Super Contest, a three\\-stage competition where you dress up your Pok\u00e9mon, have them dance, and then impress the judges with their attacks. Instead of using Pok\u00e9blocks to increase their characteristics, you bake [Poffin](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Poffin), a bun\\-like food.\n\nHeartGold and SoulSilver has something completely different known as the Pok\u00e9athalon. Your Pok\u00e9mon compete in a series of three mini\\-games, controlled via the touch screen. Depending on how well you do, you gain points, and these points can be spent on items to help you outside of the Pok\u00e9athalon. Instead of the characteristics that the contests use, 5 Pok\u00e9athalon stats were introduced \\- Speed, Power, Skill, Stamina, and Jump. Unlike the contest characteristics, the Pok\u00e9athalon stats are pre\\-determined by the species of the Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nBlack and White added the Pok\u00e9mon Musical. The first stage is similar to the first stage of the Super Contest, where you dress up your Pok\u00e9mon. Your Pok\u00e9mon then perform in the musical, and if the audience likes their performance (determined by how your Pok\u00e9mon are dressed), they will throw items that you can keep."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about changes in Pok\u00e9mon games since Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow) is NOT correct?\n\nA) The Special/Physical split means that moves are now categorized as Special or Physical based on the individual move rather than its type.\n\nB) Breeding was introduced in Generation II, allowing players to obtain Pok\u00e9mon eggs by leaving compatible Pok\u00e9mon at the Day Care.\n\nC) Natures were introduced in Generation III and affect a Pok\u00e9mon's stats, increasing one stat by 10% while decreasing another by 10%.\n\nD) The day/night system was introduced in Generation V, affecting which Pok\u00e9mon appear and when certain events occur.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct.

Would it be appropriate to calculate a Chi Squared value in this instance? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What distinguishes the first order test statistic (normal distribution) from the second order test statistic (Chi\\-squared distribution)\n\nWith the first order approximation you approximate the function $g(\\\\theta)$ as a linear function of $\\\\theta$. But this works only when there is actually a slope, that is when $g(\\\\theta)' \\\\neq 0$. \n\nWith the second order approximation you approximate the function $g(\\\\theta)$ as a polynomial function (the square) of $\\\\theta$, but this works *only* in a peak of the function $g(\\\\theta)$. \n\nI do not believe that this is applicable to your case and that you applied it correctly (It seems like you just took the square of the first order).\n\nThe image below might illustrate this intuitively:\n\n[![intuitive Delta method](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w4DeL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w4DeL.png)\n\nIn this example $Y\\=0\\.03 X^2$. And $X \\\\sim N(20, \\\\sigma)$ is normal distributed with $\\\\sigma$ changing from $36$ to $4$ and $1$. Simulations are made for 600 data points to create the histograms (60 points are used to plot on top of the curve in the graph). In the image on the left, when $X$ has a wide distribution, you see that the distribution of $Y$ is not well approximated with a linear transformation (it is a bit skewed), but as the variance of $X$ decreases (the images on the right) then the distribution starts to resemble more and more a normal distribution.\n\nSo that is what the linear transformation does in the Delta method. But when the slope is zero then this linearization doesn't work and you need to use a second order approximation of the curve. This is illustrated below\n\n[![second order case](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2QNW.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2QNW.png)\n\n> What happens to the inequality sign ?\n\nWith $H\\_0 : \\\\mu \\>\\\\sigma$ you have a composed hypothesis instead of a simple hypothesis $H\\_0 : \\\\mu \\= \\\\sigma$. This is not easy to deal with and you will typically not be able to find a hypothesis test where the probability for type I error is equal for every value of parameters that are possible in the null hypothesis.\n\nIn this case when you use the boundary for $H\\_0 : \\\\mu \\= \\\\sigma$ then you will have a rejection (type I error) rate $\\\\alpha$ when the hypothesis is true $\\\\mu \\= \\\\sigma$ but you get smaller rejection rates when $\\\\mu\\>\\\\sigma$.\n\n---\n\n> Is this the right way to deal with such a hypothesis test ?\n\nThe Delta method is very easy to apply. But in this case you could also consider the statistic $T \\= \\\\sqrt{n}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}}{s}$ which follows a non\\-central t\\-distribution with non centrality parameter $\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}$.\n\nThen you can use code for computing the non central t\\-distribution to compute boundaries more precisely than the delta method approximation.\n\n[![histogram plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYlVC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYlVC.png)\n\n```\n# testing performance of statistic mean(y)/sd(y)\n# in comparison to non-central t-distribution\n\nset.seed(1)\n\nn = 5\nmu = 3\nsigma = 3\n\ndt <- 0.2 # historgram binsize\n\n# doing simulations\nmc_test <- sapply(1:10^6, FUN = function(x) {y <- rnorm(n,mean=mu,sd=sigma); sqrt(n)*mean(y)/sd(y)})\n\n# computing and plotting histogram\nh <- hist(mc_test,\n          breaks=seq(min(mc_test)-dt,max(mc_test)+dt,dt),\n          xlim=c(-3,10),\n          freq = FALSE,\n          ylab = bquote(t-dist(T, nu == .(n), ncp==1)),\n          xlab = bquote(T == bar(x)/s),\n          main = \"histogram of simulations compared with non-central t-distribution\", cex.main=1\n          )\n\n# adding non central t-distribution to the plot\nt <- seq(-3,10,0.01)\nlines(t,dt(t,n-1,sqrt(n)),col=2)\n\nts <- seq(qt(0.95,n,sqrt(n)),10,0.01)\npolygon(c(rev(ts),ts),c(0*dt(ts,n-1,sqrt(n)),dt(ts,n-1,sqrt(n))),  \n        col = rgb(0,0,0,0.3), border = NA)\n\n# verify/compute how often boundary is exceeded\nsum(mc_test>qt(0.95,n-1,sqrt(n)))/10^6\n\n```\n\n### Comparison of boundaries as function of the sample size $n$\n\nYour statistic\\* $\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n} (\\\\hat \\\\mu \\- \\\\hat \\\\sigma)}{\\\\hat \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{1\\.5}} \\\\sim N(0,1\\)$ leads to $\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}}{s} \\\\sim N(\\\\sqrt{n},1\\.5\\)$ which is the asymptotic behaviour of the non central distribution that we derived:\n\n[![methods comparison](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OJhvo.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OJhvo.png)\n\n```\n#different values of n\nn <- 3:200\n# boundary based on t-distribution\nbt <- qt(0.95,n-1,sqrt(n))\n#boundary based on delta method\ndt <- qnorm(0.95,sqrt(n),sqrt(1.5))\n\n# plotting\nplot(n,dt,type='l',\n     xlab = \"n\",ylab = \"95% criterium\" )\nlines(n,bt,pch=21,col=2)\n\nlegend(0,16,c(\"t-distribution\", \"Delta-method\"),box.col=0,col=c(1,2),lty=1,cex=0.7)\n\n```\n\n---\n\n*\\*In your computations the factor $3$ should be a factor $1\\.5$*\n\n$$\\[1,\\- \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma}] \\\\ \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{n} \\& 0 \\\\\\\\0 \\& \\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma^4}{n} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\[1,\\- \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma}]^T\n \\= \\\\frac{1\\.5 \\\\sigma^2}{n}$$\n\n*and also the square root term $\\\\sqrt{n}$ should not be added (because you only have one measurement of $\\\\hat\\\\mu \\- \\\\sqrt{\\\\hat\\\\sigma^2}$ ).

Creating a new input record would mean that this code:\n\n```\nawk '\n    {\n        print $0\n        magic to create a new record with contents \"Foo\"\n    }\n'\n\n```\n\nwould print the original record then enter an infinite loop printing \"Foo\" because by definition awk executes the above code once per input record.\n\nYou can do things to execute code on strings whether they're from an input record or created internally, e.g.:\n\n```\nawk '\n    {\n        prt($0)\n        other stuff\n        prt(\"Foo\")\n    }\n    function prt(str) {\n        print str\n    }\n'\n\n```\n\nbut that's not the same as actually creating a new input record.\n\nYou could also do a 2\\-pass approach to create and write to a temp file on the first pass so that when reading the temp file for the second pass the newly printed strings are now present as input records.\n\nYou're overload/abusing the meaning of `NR` though. `NR` is the count of **input** records read, you're trying to print a count of **output** records printed which is a completely different thing. There is no builtin variable for that as it's trivial to just keep track of it yourself in a separate variable rather than messing with `NR`, e.g. with `onr` below:\n\n```\n$ cat file\nawk '\n    BEGIN { print \"NR\", \"onr\", \"line\" }\n    NR == 1 { val = $2-1 }\n    {\n        for (val++; val<$2; val++) {\n            processString($1 FS val)\n        }\n        processString($0)\n    }\n\n    function processString(str) {\n        print NR, ++onr, str\n    }\n' file\nNR onr line\n1 1 entry 13\n2 2 entry 14\n2 3 entry 15\n3 4 entry 16\n3 5 entry 17\n3 6 entry 18\n\n```\n\nAgain though \\- we are NOT creating new input records and so (**as always**) it'd be completely inappropriate to try to adjust the value of the builtin variable `NR`. Instead we're simply generating new output records and keeping track of the total number of output records in a user\\-defined variable named `onr`.\n\nI added both `NR` and `onr` to the output and changed the sample input to:\n\n```\n$ cat file\nentry 13\nentry 15\nentry 18\n\n```\n\nto highlight that there's actually 3 separate data items in play:\n\n1. `NR` \\= the number of input records,\n2. `onr` \\= the number of output records,\n3. `val` \\= the value of the $2 to be printed for each record\n\nand for clarity, cohesion, coupling, maintenance etc. of your program it's best not to overload any of them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In AWK, when processing a file with missing entries that need to be filled in, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) You can create new input records on-the-fly within a single pass of the input file.\nB) The built-in variable NR can be directly modified to account for newly inserted records.\nC) It's impossible to generate output for missing entries without modifying the input file.\nD) You can generate output for missing entries using a custom function, without creating new input records.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because AWK processes input records sequentially and cannot create new input records during a single pass.\nB is incorrect as NR is a built-in variable that counts input records and should not be modified.\nC is incorrect because it's possible to generate output for missing entries without modifying the input file.\nD is correct.

This is because the mean free path between inelastic scatterings is short enough that it takes tens of thousands of years for those photons to rattle around and finally make it to the photosphere and stream off into space.

The photosphere is where the majority of visible light is emitted, creating a characteristic black-body spectrum that defines the \"surface\" temperature we observe and calculate."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/18", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2651", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/31/"], "docs_id": 2651, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My \"Select By Location\" dialog window keeps falling behind other windows(such as my table window) that I have on my second monitor. \n\nSo far, the only way to fix it is to move the table window to the first monitor which allows me to get the the \"Select By Location\" dialog window, and then window juggle.\n\nThe \"Select By Location\" dialog window doesn't create an item in the taskbar which would be useful (I could right\\-click and move).

I like to hit the ap carry to prevent them fro using abilities, then, if possible, the ad carry to make them hit me, then the support to prevent heals. Is this right or am i clueless?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You want to try and hit as many as possible basically.\n\nYou have the correct idea though, prioritizing those targets.\n\nYou will *almost always* want to hit the AD carry as they generally have the most DPS and potential to wreck your team. Taunting them takes them out of the fight for a short while. The only time you wouldn't target them is of course if they aren't there, and if they are severely underfed or under\\-leveled.\n\nTargeting the AP carry is also a good idea as like you said, it keeps them from casting spells. You will especially want to target AP carrys with channeled abilities, especially Katarina. This stops the abilities and in turn most of their damage.\n\nTargeting supports isn't a high priority due to their low damage. Unless they built items for damage or have great team\\-fight abilities (Sona and Nami's ult for example) you might want to target them and get your team to focus them down before they get the chance to use their ultimate's.\n\nIn the end though, the general idea is to target as many high\\-damage / high\\-utility targets as possible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a team fight scenario, what is the most effective targeting strategy for Galio's taunt ability (Hero's Entrance) according to the given information?\n\nA) Always prioritize the support first to prevent healing, then the AP carry, and lastly the AD carry\nB) Target as many high-damage and high-utility champions as possible, with a focus on the AD carry, AP carry, and then support if feasible\nC) Exclusively focus on AP carries with channeled abilities, such as Katarina, to interrupt their spells\nD) Primarily target the jungler and top laner to disrupt the enemy team's frontline\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation emphasizes targeting as many high-damage and high-utility champions as possible. It specifically mentions prioritizing the AD carry for their high DPS potential, followed by the AP carry to prevent spell casting, especially those with channeled abilities. The support is mentioned as a lower priority unless they have significant damage or team-fight abilities.

You want to add the sidebar back. Which of the following steps would most likely resolve this issue?\n\nA) Add widgets to the search results page through the Magento admin panel\nB) Modify the catalogsearch_result_index.xml file in the app/design directory to remove any \"remove=\"true\"\" attributes\nC) Edit the search.phtml template file to manually add the sidebar HTML\nD) Install a third-party extension that adds sidebars to all pages\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution is to modify the catalogsearch_result_index.xml file. This layout file controls the structure of the search results page. If the sidebar is missing, it's likely due to \"remove=\"true\"\" attributes on container or block references for the sidebar. By removing or commenting out these lines and clearing the Magento cache, the sidebar should reappear. \n\nOption A is incorrect because adding widgets through the admin panel won't typically restore a missing sidebar structure.\nOption C is not the best approach as it bypasses Magento's layout system and could lead to maintenance issues.\nOption D is unnecessary and could introduce complications or conflicts with the existing theme.\n\nThe correct approach (B) aligns with Magento's best practices for theme customization and is the most targeted solution to the described problem."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/23", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/121252", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/22275/"], "docs_id": 121252, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have found an open source library that can work fine with my project,\nbut I have noted that It's not frequently updated and I'm afraid of not having the necessary support.\n\nIs the frequency of updates a proper criterion for choosing an open source library rather than another?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It can be, if you expect that the code you're reusing will often have defects that will cause defects in your application, and therefore have to be fixed. (Of course, you should thoroughly test the part of the library that you actually used and verify that it does the job correctly *before* you ship it with your product, but we all know the world isn't that tidy.) If this is the case you should not make commercial success dependent on third\\-party libraries where you are not sure about support \\- whether open\\-source or not! \n\nBut bear in mind that \"few updates\" and \"likely to have defects\" is not necessarily correlated. In fact, it may be anti\\-correlated for very wide\\-spread, very mature products. And of course, the bonus of open source is that if there *is* a defect with a clear and obvious fix, you can just make the fix without having to wait for external support at all."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When evaluating an open-source library for use in a commercial project, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the frequency of updates and the library's suitability?\n\nA) Frequent updates always indicate a more reliable and suitable library for commercial use.\n\nB) Infrequent updates necessarily mean the library is unstable and should be avoided.\n\nC) The frequency of updates should be considered alongside other factors such as maturity, widespread use, and the specific needs of your project.\n\nD) Open-source libraries with few updates are always preferable as they are likely to have fewer defects.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it aligns most closely with the nuanced perspective presented in the documentation. The frequency of updates is indeed a factor to consider, but it's not the only or necessarily the most important criterion. The documentation points out that \"few updates\" and \"likely to have defects\" are not always correlated, and may even be anti-correlated for widely-used, mature products. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because frequent updates don't always indicate reliability; they could also suggest ongoing issues.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute and doesn't account for the possibility of mature, stable libraries that don't require frequent updates.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it makes an unfounded assumption. While mature libraries might have fewer updates, this doesn't automatically mean they have fewer defects or are always preferable.\n\nThe key takeaway is to consider update frequency alongside other factors like the library's maturity, its widespread use, and how well it meets your project's specific needs. Additionally, the open-source nature allows for fixing defects yourself if necessary."}}
