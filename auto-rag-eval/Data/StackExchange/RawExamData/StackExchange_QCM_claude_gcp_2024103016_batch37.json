Are there any necessary or sufficient conditions that can be imposed to ensure infinitely many solutions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the Fibonacci numbers seem an acceptable recurrence, consider these identities:\n\n* For $m$ even $F\\_{3m}\\=5F\\_{m}^3\\+3F\\_{m}$\n* For $m$ odd $\\\\ F\\_{3m}\\=5F\\_{m}^3\\-3F\\_{m}$\n\nSo a sixth are of the form $5x^3\\+3x $ and another sixth are of the form $5x^3\\-3x.$ There are similar results of every odd degree but I don't know about even degree. The same would be true (I think) for any sequence given by a recurrence with initial values $0,1$ and rule $a\\_{n\\+1}\\=ca\\_n\\+a\\_{n\\-1}$\n\n---\n\nFor another kind of example, the initial values $a\\_0\\=\\\\alpha,$ $a\\_1\\=2\\\\alpha\\+2$\n\nand rule $a\\_{n\\+1}\\=4(a\\_n\\-a\\_{n\\-1}).$\n\nyield $a\\_n\\=(n\\+\\\\alpha)2^n$ so, with $\\\\alpha\\=6$, it would seem that $a\\_n$ is a square exactly for $n\\=4m^2\\-6\\.$ \n\nUsing $5^n$ in place of $2^n$ would be even more exotic, then one also has $n\\=5(2m\\+1\\)^2\\-6$.\n\n---\n\nLooking at the the most simple cases, in terms of the order $k$ of the recurrence $L\\_n \\= a\\_k L\\_{n\\-1} \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ a\\_1 L\\_{n\\-k\\-1}$ and/or the degree $d$ of the polynomial $f(x)$ allows some speculation on what can happen in general.\n\n* For $d\\=0$ we have a constant polynomial $f(x)\\=c.$ An integer sequence $L\\_n$ (given by a linear homogeneous recurrence with constant coefficients) can be periodic with in which case $L\\_n\\=c$ happens, if at all, when $n$ belongs to one or more congruence classes modulo the period $p.$ Otherwise it happens finitely often. $L\\_{n\\+6}\\-L\\_n\\=0$ gives period $6$ as does $L\\_{n\\+2}\\-L{n\\+1}\\+L\\_n$ (since $x^6\\-1\\=(x^2\\-x\\+1\\)(x^4\\+x^2\\-x\\-1\\)$). But if $L\\_n$ is not periodic then $L\\_n\\=c$ happens only finitely often (perhaps $k$ times at most?)\n* For $d\\=1$ we have a linear polynomial $f(x)\\=kx\\+c$. The values $L\\_n \\\\bmod k$ are (eventually) periodic with a period $p \\\\le k^d$ so $L\\_n \\\\bmod k\\=c$ happens either finitely often or else exactly when $n$ belongs to certain congruence classes $\\\\bmod p$ (with small exceptions, for example $2\\\\ 3^n$ has the form $9x\\+0$ except when $n\\=0,1$.\n* For $k\\=1$ the sequence is $L\\_n\\=A\\\\ b^n.$ What can be said then? For $f(x)\\=cx^s$ things are fairly clear.\n* With $k\\=2$ there is already much to think about but special cases include arithmetic progressions $An\\+B$ which satisfy $L\\_{n\\+2}\\-2L\\_{n\\+1}\\+L\\_n\\=0$, and more generally $(An\\+B)b^n$ from $L\\_{n\\+2}\\-2bL\\_{n\\+1}\\+b^2L\\_n\\=0$ Here the condition may be that the index $n$ itself is of a certain form of degree $d$ or less.\n\n---\n\nAny polynomial satisfies a recurrence, so consider $L\\_n\\=n^2(2n^2\\-1\\)$ or $L\\_n\\=n^2(2n^2\\-1\\)2^{n\\+1}$ either is a square for the alternate values of the Pell sequence $1,2,5,12,29,70,\\\\cdots$\n\nSo I would wildly speculate that given two sequences $L,M$ ( given by LHRCC) we have that $L\\_n\\=M\\_m$ happens (with finitely many exceptions), either never or else whenever the index $n$ itself is a member of a sequence ( or one of a few sequences) given by such a recurrence."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about linear recurrence sequences and polynomials is correct?\n\nA) For any linear recurrence sequence Ln and any polynomial f(x) of degree 2 or higher, there are always infinitely many terms Ln that can be expressed as f(m) for some integer m.\n\nB) The Fibonacci sequence has exactly three terms that are perfect squares: F1 = F2 = 1 and F12 = 144.\n\nC) For the sequence defined by L_{n+1} = 4(Ln - L_{n-1}) with initial values L0 = 6 and L1 = 14, Ln is a perfect square infinitely often.\n\nD) It is impossible for any linear recurrence sequence to have infinitely many terms that are of the form f(m) where f(x) is a fixed polynomial of degree 2 or higher and m is an integer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option A is incorrect because there are many cases where this doesn't hold true. Option B is incorrect because while these are square Fibonacci numbers, it's not an exhaustive list (F1 = F2 = 1 is counted twice). Option D is incorrect because there are known examples of such sequences. \n\nOption C is correct. For the given recurrence Ln = (n+6)2^n.

When a power source's voltage is below the LED's forward voltage (2.1V in this case), only a very small amount of current can flow through the LED.

Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Readers: please be patient, eventually the question and answer will hopefully be reduced to some concise content.\n\nOf all the information provided, this is the most relevant:\n\n```\ncpu0: MSR_RAPL_POWER_UNIT: 0x000a0e03 (0.125000 Watts, 0.000061 Joules, 0.000977 sec.)\ncpu0: MSR_PKG_POWER_INFO: 0x00000078 (15 W TDP, RAPL 0 - 0 W, 0.000000 sec.)\ncpu0: MSR_PKG_POWER_LIMIT: 0x42016000dc8090 (UNlocked)\ncpu0: PKG Limit #1: ENabled (18.000000 Watts, 28.000000 sec, clamp DISabled)\ncpu0: PKG Limit #2: DISabled (44.000000 Watts, 0.002441* sec, clamp DISabled)\n...\nBusy%  Bzy_MHz   IRQ  PkgTmp  PkgWatt  GFXWatt   RAMWatt\n99.77   1700     17    55      7.24     0.00      0.00\n\nrdmsr 0x64f\n3d030400\n\n```\n\nIndicating that the processor is currently throttling due to Processor package power limit \\#1, while at the same time the processor is nowhere near package power limit \\#1, at least if we believe what turbostat is telling us.\n\nManually decoding MSR 0x64F gives, among others, bit 10 is set. From the 64\\-ia\\-32\\-architectures\\-software\\-developer\\-manual\\-325462:\n\n> Package/Platform\\-Level Power Limiting PL1 Status (R0\\) When set,\n> frequency is reduced below the operating system request due to\n> package/platform\\-level power limiting PL1\\.\n\nThe other bits are all latched log bits and not relevant just now.\n\nThe RAPL\\_POWER\\_UNIT MSR (0x606\\) gave 0x000a0e03, which does decode correctly to 0\\.125 watts per bit.\n\nThe PKG\\_POWER\\_LIMIT MSR (0x610\\) gave 0x42016000dc8090\\. Let's decode the power limit 1 part manually. Bits 14:0 define the limit, or 90h or 144 decimal. Times .125 \\= 18 watts, as expected. Bit 15 is 1, so it is enabled.\n\nSo, something appears to be wrong and the processor appears to be not behaving the way it should.\n\nCould it be somehow related to the unusually high processor package limit \\#2? Normally it would be set to about 1\\.25 times power limit \\#1\\. such a high value will likely give issues.\n\nEDIT 1: returning to MSR 0x64F, the other latched bits indicate the temperature, PROCHOT (always bad), and \"OTHER\" conditions had previously occurred. Myself, I would turn down power limit 2 from 44 watts to about 22 or 23 watts. Also suggest taking a long slow look at this, coming from the low side of CPU frequency. For example, set a very low CPU maximum frequency:\n\n```\necho 10 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n\n```\n\nand then apply the heavy load, all the while watching with turbostat and watching MSR 0x64f, simultaneously in two terminal windows. Gradually increase the CPU frequency:\n\n```\necho 15 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho 20 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho 25 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n...\n\n```\n\nuntil it throttles.\n\nEDIT 2: Clock Modulation is probably involved, if so likely from the BIOS and likely due to the extraordinarily high setting for power limit \\#2\\. The way to know is to read MSR 0x19A during the odd throttling event. Do `sudo rdmsr -a 0x19a`.

On some computers, it never gets reset."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A laptop with an Intel Core i7-8550U CPU is experiencing unexpected CPU throttling under Ubuntu 20.04.

This extreme setting appears to be triggering clock modulation, causing the CPU to throttle even when it's not near its normal power limits. The MSR 0x64F shows bit 10 is set, indicating throttling due to package power limiting, despite turbostat showing the CPU isn't near its power limit.

And that is how most people will interpret\n\n> What he did is killing animals.\n\nThey will view that sentence as describing a past act with current consequences.\n\nSo I am **NOT** saying that we have a grammatical rule against having past and present in the same sentence.

Nouns do not have tense. But your meaning that current views consider what he did to be the killing of animals (with the implication that views at the time of the killing were different) is lost by the use of the gerund alone.\n\nThe purpose of language is to convey meaning. That requires more than being grammatical.\n\n**EDIT**: This edit relates to the original poster\u2019s comment to my original answer.\n\nIn general, if you want to be clear about changing meanings, you seldom do it through tense or other grammatical devices **ALONE**.

I have a particular bias. Let me transpose your question to another context. \n\nSay someone comes up with a \"computation\" of the unstable homotopy groups of spheres. It's just a list of finite abelian groups, given via their Smith Normal Form presentation. The person provides no context for how they computed those groups. So it would be quite difficult to use that computation to say much about any specific homotopy\\-class of map $S^m \\\\to S^n$, except in the special case where one knows the group is trivial. But even then, the computation provides no way to explicitly construct an extension $D^{m\\+1} \\\\to S^n$. \n\nIn my opinion, constructing explicit eversions of the sphere is very much like the above.

This plugin uses JavaScript and WebGL to generate a 3D visualization that can be viewed outside of QGIS.\n\nOption A is incorrect because QGIS doesn't have a built-in 3D viewer for point data.\nOption B would result in losing the spatial components of the data and is not a true 3D visualization.\nOption D is incorrect because profile tools typically work with raster data, not point data.\n\nThe correct solution (C) allows for true 3D visualization while maintaining the integrity of the original X, Y, and Z data."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/21", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/208529", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/9162/"], "docs_id": 208529, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Merkle \\& Steyvers (2013\\) write:\n\n> To formally define a proper scoring rule, let $f$ be a probabilistic\n>  forecast of a Bernoulli trial $d$ with true success probability $p$.\n>  Proper scoring rules are metrics whose expected values are minimized\n>  if $f \\= p$.\n\nI get that this is good because we want to encourage forecasters to generating forecasts that honestly reflect their true beliefs, and don't want to give them perverse incentives to do otherwise.\n\nAre there any real\\-world examples in which it's appropriate to use an improper scoring rule?\n\n**Reference**  \n\n[Merkle, E.

I don't really care whether another forecaster is cheating or not when I am the one who is going to be doing the forecast.\n\nProper scoring rules ensure that during estimation process the model approaches the true data generating process (DGP). This sounds promising because as we approach the true DGP we will be also doing good in terms of forecasting under any loss function. The catch is that most of the time (actually in reality almost always) our model search space doesn't contain the true DGP. We end up approximating the true DGP with some functional form that we propose.\n\nIn this more realistic setting, if our forecasting task is easier than to figure out the entire density of the true DGP we may actually do better. This is especially true for classification. For example the true DGP can be very complex but the classification task can be very easy. \n\nYaroslav Bulatov provided the following example in his blog:\n\n[http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log\\-loss\\-or\\-hinge\\-loss.html](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log-loss-or-hinge-loss.html)\n\nAs you can see below the true density is wiggly but it is very easy to build a classifier to separate data generated by this into two classes. Simply if $x \\\\ge 0$ output class 1, and if $x \\< 0$ output class 2\\.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)\n\nInstead of matching the exact density above we propose the below crude model, which is quite far from the true DGP. However it does perfect classification. This is found by using hinge loss, which is not proper.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)\n\nOn the other hand if you decide to find the true DGP with log\\-loss (which is proper) then you start fitting some functionals, as you don't know what the exact functional form you need a priori. But as you try harder and harder to match it, you start misclassifying things.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)\n\nNote that in both cases we used the same functional forms. In the improper loss case it degenerated into a step function which in turn did perfect classification. In the proper case it went berserk trying to satisfy every region of the density. \n\nBasically we don't always need to achieve the true model to have accurate forecasts. Or sometimes we don't really need to do good on the entire domain of the density, but be very good only on certain parts of it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a classification model for a complex dataset where the true data generating process (DGP) is unknown. The primary goal is to achieve the best possible classification accuracy rather than to infer the true underlying probability distribution. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for this task?\n\nA) Use a proper scoring rule like log-loss to ensure the model approaches the true DGP\nB) Employ an improper scoring rule such as hinge loss to optimize classification performance\nC) Always use a proper scoring rule to maintain statistical consistency\nD) Avoid using any scoring rules and rely solely on raw accuracy metrics\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. In this scenario, an improper scoring rule like hinge loss would be most appropriate. The question emphasizes that the primary goal is classification accuracy rather than inferring the true probability distribution. As explained in the provided information, when the true DGP is complex but the classification task is relatively simple, an improper scoring rule can often lead to better classification performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while proper scoring rules like log-loss are useful for approaching the true DGP, they may lead to suboptimal classification performance when the model space doesn't contain the true DGP.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it overstates the necessity of always using proper scoring rules. As demonstrated in the example, there are cases where improper scoring rules can be more effective for specific tasks like classification.\n\nOption D is incorrect because scoring rules, whether proper or improper, play an important role in model optimization. Simply relying on raw accuracy metrics without a scoring rule for optimization would likely lead to suboptimal results.\n\nThe key insight is that when the goal is forecasting or classification rather than inference about the true probability distribution, improper scoring rules can sometimes lead to better performance, especially when the true DGP is complex but the classification boundary is simple."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/05", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/319403", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/73190/"], "docs_id": 319403, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To make copying quicker from my hard drive to external hard drive and the other way around, I sometimes have several transfers windows together transferring multiple files/folders.\n\nDoes this method cause **fragmented hard drive** and it is better to have 1 transfer instead of multiple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In practice, *No*.

While there is a theoretical possibility of increased fragmentation due to multiple simultaneous transfers, the practical impact is minimal. The documentation suggests that the potential for fragmentation from this specific action is negligible compared to the numerous writes a typical computer performs daily.

Instead of having awk called with all the files as arguments and having the shell fail with a \"too many arguments\" error, you can have awk read all the files as input and populate it's internal array of files to read (`ARGV[]`) from that:\n\n```\nfind ./ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.txt' |\nawk '\n    BEGIN { OFS=\",\"; print \"Name\", \"Number\" }\n    NR==FNR { ARGV[ARGC++]=$0; next }\n    /value/ { print substr(FILENAME,3), $8 }\n' - > out.csv\n\n```\n\nI also tidied up a couple of things in the awk script and got rid of the pipe to sed as you never need sed when you're using awk. I changed `>>` to `>` as I assume you want to create the output file from scratch whenever the above command is called rather than appending to it.\n\nThe above assumes none of your file names contain newlines. If they do then use GNU tools and add `-print0` to the end of the `find` command and `RS=\"\\0\";` to the BEGIN section of the awk command. It also assumes your file names don't contain `\"` as then the output wouldn't be valid CSV but your first script that you said works perfectly apart from the \"too many arguments\" issue would fail if your file names contained any of those so they must not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using find and awk together to process many text files and output results to a CSV, which approach correctly ensures the header is only printed once, regardless of the number of files processed?\n\nA) Use xargs to pass files to awk:\n   find ./ -name '*.txt' | xargs awk 'BEGIN{print \"Header\"}/pattern/{print $0}'\n\nB) Process files in batches with find -exec:\n   find ./ -name '*.txt' -exec awk 'BEGIN{print \"Header\"}/pattern/{print $0}' {} +\n\nC) Populate awk's ARGV array from find output:\n   find ./ -name '*.txt' | awk 'BEGIN{print \"Header\"} NR==FNR{ARGV[ARGC++]=$0; next} /pattern/{print $0}' -\n\nD) Use a shell loop to process each file:\n   find ./ -name '*.txt' | while read file; do awk 'BEGIN{print \"Header\"}/pattern/{print $0}' \"$file\"; done\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct approach to ensure the header is printed only once when processing multiple files. By populating awk's ARGV array from the find output, we can control when the BEGIN block (which prints the header) is executed. This method allows awk to process all files as if they were provided as command-line arguments, but without running into \"too many arguments\" errors.\n\nOption A (using xargs) can lead to the header being printed multiple times if xargs splits the input into multiple awk invocations.\n\nOption B (using find -exec) also risks printing the header multiple times if the number of files causes multiple awk executions.\n\nOption D (using a shell loop) would definitely print the header for each file processed, as awk is invoked separately for each file.\n\nOnly option C ensures that the BEGIN block is executed once at the start, followed by processing all files, regardless of their number."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/10/29", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27702", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/19756/"], "docs_id": 27702, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I'm trying to see all the questions tagged **web.config** or **app.config** I'm sent to an URL like:\n\n`http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/web.config`\n\nwhich shows an XML parsing error:\n\n```\nXML Parsing Error: no element found\nLocation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/web.config\nLine Number 1, Column 1:\n^\n\n```\n\nIt's normal from an ASP.NET point of view, but I would like to see those questions instead.\n\nSince adding another tag like **asp.net** means an URL like:\n\n`http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/web.config asp.net`\n\nwhich solves the problem, but restrict the results, I propose to create an empty, meaningless tag which would not restrict the result set but would avoid the errors.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The solution is re\\-tagging `web.config` to `web-config`.

I bet large companies like google don't return 500 every time one of their servers go offline.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an area where you don't have canned patterns. So let's look at what your stated needs are:\n\n* You need to know if am insert was successful\n* The update could come from any of 3 different sources\n\nIdeally, we would need a means of generating a unique key that is derived from the data you are receiving in some way.\n\nIf we only had one source of information, we would be able to use the message Id to identify if the record was inserted or not. Another option would be to codify the source and the message id together. Example: source is codified as 1,2 or 3, so you append the message Id to the 1, 2, or 3 prefix. It can work, assuming every message Id is unique. That may or may not be true.\n\nAnother option is to have a creation date, trace ID and trace source in the table you are writing to. This allows you to query before writing. In this case I would have a transaction:\n\n* Query to see if there is a record written since the message was authored that came from the same source and has the same message id.\n\t+ `WHERE creationDate > ? AND messageSource = ? AND messageId = ?` where the ? marks parameters for the query.\n* If nothing is found, write the update (including the source and trace id)\\-\\-otherwise it has already been written\n* Complete the transaction\n\n**On the topic of connection drops**\n\nIf you are having a connection dropped intermittently, but often enough where this is a real problem, then something is wrong. It could be that your configuration is set for tolerances that are unreasonable. It could also be that you need to change your approach. For example, a timeouts would be a symptom where you need to step back and take a stock of the larger picture.\n\n* Don't request a connection until you are ready to do something with the database\n* If it's going to be a while until you do the next thing, release the connection when you are done\n* Determine if the timeout is network related, record related, or due to some other resource contention\n\nWhen you are getting timeouts due to a network something is very wrong. I was on a program where actions that were taking milliseconds suddenly started taking minutes. It turned out that the infrastructure team moved the DNS server in a way where our servers were not updated. In self defense we put entries in our HOSTS file so our servers could always find the other servers we deployed to, as well as fixing the IP address of the DNS server.\n\nSometimes it's not the network layer, and your database is suffering from severe record locking problems. This can happen if your database silently promotes record locking to page locking, or worse, page locking (here's looking at you MS SQL Server). Your options here are to offload queries from your database or ensure that queries are for snapshots of data (i.e. does not have to wait for transactions to resolve). In this case, make use of Redis when reading individual records, and ElasticSearch (or equivalent) when performing complex queries. The idea is that the database serves as gold master and everything else is a slave to that data. The more you can relieve contention from the database, the faster your system will feel.\n\nFinally, there can be other types of resource contention. Examples include disk access during a security update, network bandwidth due to very chatty communications, etc.\n\nIt's always good to have a solution to ensure a write once semantic, but when you are constantly dealing with something that should not be a problem, sometimes you need to take a look at what's causing the issue. That's a pain, but the general process is the same:\n\n* Look for correlations (i.e. events happening at the same time)\n* Go through a process of elimination until you find the cause"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A microservice architecture is experiencing intermittent connection drops with its database, causing uncertainty about whether database operations were successful.

It addresses the core issue of uncertainty about whether an operation was successful.\n2. It prevents duplicate entries by first checking for the existence of the record.\n3.

As far as I understand, (almost) all integers in the real world arise as an approximate description of composite dynamics.\n\nI think anyone here understands why individual macroscopic objects, like rocks, buildings, etc. are approximations that we can count, so I'll dive directly into quantum world.\n\nThe obvious argument about where integers could naturally arise is a quantum harmonic oscillator, which dynamics results in the energy states that we can count with integers:\n$$E\\=(n\\+1/2\\)\\\\hbar\\\\omega$$\nOr the energy states of atoms in the same way.\n\nHowever, there are no free quantum harmonic oscillators in reals life! In real life quantum fields are interacting, and discrete energy states are simply an approximation. To see this clearly consider quantum particle. We can count individual particles, right?\n\nNo! If we take full interacting theory, the particle states polarise the vacuum and, if we start looking closer (at higher energies), we will start seeing that there is no individual particles and what we see from far away as a single particle actually is some kind of a superposition of multiparticles states. (We actually don't really know what \"particles\" are. Abstractly this is captured in the Haag's theorem, stating that the state space of an interacting QFT is not a Fock space.) Moreover such state will never be localized.\n\nLooking at the world from the perspective of interacting QFT allows us to find similar arguments for any system where integers arise. Hence, integers are approximations and not natural.\n\nThe ONLY place, where I see integers as fundamental building blocks are the dimensions of symmetry groups of our world. The integer dimensions of the Lorentz group result in the 4\\-dimensional spacetime, the integer dimensions of the SM groups $SU(3\\)\\\\times SU(2\\)\\\\times U(1\\)$ result in the integer number of different particle types.\n\n**Update 1:**\nA very good point were made about the charge. If we measure the number of elementary charges in a given area, it will always be an integer number, even though the number of particles is not conserved (in QFT). It means, that any physical state is an eigenstate of a charge operator with an integer eigenvalue.\nConsider the simplest case, where the minimal set of mutually commuting operators consist of the Hamiltonian, **H**, and the charge operator, **Q**. Then we can label our states in terms of their eigenvalues $\\|E,q\\\\rangle$. However, are there any requirement, that $q$ is only an integer?\n\n**Update 2:**\nI think, I still need to elaborate on macroscopic objects to stop discussing the distribution of windows \\=)\nConsider, say, rocks, fingers or even particles. You can count them, for example, by counting the number of distinct maxima in their density distribution. This counting is an approximation. First problem is that we need to agree what exactly will count for a single object. Second problem is that these objects are not stable in time: stones will break down and the probability distribution of a particle will become highly delocalized. The next problem is that if you zoom in, you can loose your definition of a single particle: due to vacuum polarizations any electron is surrounded by a cloud of other particles. I'm ok with integers arising from approximate description, they are just not fundamental to the theory.\n\n**Update 3:**\nThe question was temporary closed as being opinion\\-based. So here are two questions that can, in principle, be answered with facts and citations:\n\n1. Following \"Update 2\", are there any mechanisms that relate the fact that the symmetry space, say $U(1\\)$, has integer dimensions and the fact that all the physical state are eigenvalues of the generator of $U(1\\)$ with integer eigenvalues? Simply put, why the charged is quantized and quantized evenly?\n2. Is there a way, to construct a symmetry group, such that it doesn't have an integer number of dimensions? Such that the number of generators is not an integer number (whatever that means \\=))\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are plenty of exact integers in physics.\n\nTake a wavefunction, for example: $\\\\psi(x) \\= \\\\langle x \\| \\\\psi \\\\rangle$. You can count the stationary points and the zero crossings. 1,2,3, ....\n\nIn the room where I am sitting, there are exactly 2 windows.

Players in Diablo III can indeed select up to 6 skills at a time (two for mouse buttons and four bound to other keys), and they can attach one rune to each skill. While skills and runes can be changed at any time, including during combat, doing so triggers a cooldown on that skill slot.

I'd get another pieces of blocking maybe even a piece of 3/4 ply and screw it into both the 2x6 bottom plate of the wall and screw down from your new subfloor into this piece. The initial piece will hold most of the weight and the blocking on flat will keep the back end from deflecting but doesn't have to go the full width of the joist bay. If you use ply then you'd want to make a couple ledgers for side support on the two joists.\n\nFor the joist bay with the vent and the drain pipe; I'd get a length of angle iron. I can't tell the height from the top of the joists to the top of the drain pipe but if it is 2\" or 1\\.5\" then I'd get a 2\"x2\" angle iron and bolt it to the joist running under the bottom plate. I'd then have the subfloor sit on the 2\" flange and glue it there.\n\nThis is a bathroom the flooring spans aren't crazy and a 2\"x2\" angle iron at maybe 1/4\" thick should provide support to replace 1/2 the load of the small span of your subfloor at this location.
