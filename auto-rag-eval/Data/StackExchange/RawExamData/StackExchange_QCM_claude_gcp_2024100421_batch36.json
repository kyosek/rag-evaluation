The [most recent questions](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/171536/whats-so-difficult-about-svn-merges) I could find here on SE are from 2012\\. \n\nSometimes there's a mention that the reason is that SVN prior to v1\\.5 didn't have metadata, but SVN is at version 1\\.8\\.9 now.\n\nGiven that SVN is now much more mature than v1\\.5, and especially the fact that we didn't use SVN 1\\.5 so we don't suffer from the mentioned lack of metadata \\-\\- **is there still much validity in those arguments against SVN?**\n\nI understand that DVCS has a completely different approach which is often more desirable, but for those who \"must\" ues SVN for whatever reason, merging isn't really \"hell\" anymore, is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It works fine **if you stick to the simple cases**, but there are some complex ones that don't.\n\nThe limitations I can think of:\n\n* It can only find the most recent ancestor if it is on one of the branches involved. So if you create `branches/this` and `branches/that` both from `trunk` and then try to merge `branches/this` to `branches/that`, it will not know what to do. Which means you can only merge branch to or from it's parent. You may run into this if you start two feature branches and later realize that the features are interdependent and need to combine them.\n* While it claims it can track renames, merging branches when files were moved on one side and modified on the other does not always find the right files to merge and manually fixing it up is somewhat tedious as it does not leave the necessary information around anywhere at hand.\n* Added files sometimes cause spurious conflicts on later merges.\n* Since subversion does not have separate concept of branch, you can merge only a subtree of a project and that can lead to big mess pretty quickly. It is strongly recommended to take care to always merge complete branches. Unfortunately for some reason sometimes the merge info properties appear on subdirectories even if they seem superfluous and the merge was correctly done to the whole branch.\n* Last but not least it is **slow**. Merges on a project of any serious size often takes minutes where most DVCS can do it *under* a second."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the current state of merging in SVN (Subversion) compared to Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)?\n\nA) SVN merging is now completely on par with DVCS tools and has no significant limitations.\n\nB) SVN merging still has some limitations, but works well for simple cases and has improved significantly since version 1.5.\n\nC) SVN merging remains extremely difficult and should be avoided in all scenarios.\n\nD) SVN merging is faster than DVCS merging for projects of any size.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While SVN merging has improved since version 1.5 and works well for simple cases, it still has some limitations compared to DVCS tools. These limitations include:\n\n1. Difficulty in merging between parallel branches that don't have a direct parent-child relationship.\n2. Challenges with merging when files have been both moved and modified.\n3. Potential for spurious conflicts with added files in later merges.\n4. Risks associated with merging subtrees instead of complete branches.\n5. Slower performance on large projects compared to DVCS tools.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SVN still has notable limitations.

What is going wrong in this derivation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are ~~three~~ two things wrong with your derivation.\n\n~~No. 1 (not too bad) is that you assume $\\\\vec{D}$ and $\\\\vec{P}$ to be given as gradients of potentials, which in general is not given. (As already commented by basics) But ok, limiting to a special case should still yield the desired result, so that's not it.~~ Silly me.\n\nNo. 2 is that you are missing the assumption of a linear medium that is usually used in deriving the integral $\\\\int \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\\\,\\\\text{d}V$ for the energy. In a Lagrangian formalism (and you might do the same with energy) the dielectric displacement is the conjugate quantity to the electric field, i.e. given a Lagrangian density $\\\\mathcal{L}$ we have\n$$\nD\\_i \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial E\\_i}\\\\,.\n$$\nFor a linear isotropic medium, with the free\\-field Lagrangian being\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2\n$$\nyou will find that $\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}$ and thus indeed\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E}\\\\,.\n$$\nIn a nonlinear model this is not generally true, for example for the electrostatic Heisenberg\\-Euler Lagrangian\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\n($E\\_0$ being some arbitrary constant field)\nyou will find that\n$$\n\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\+ 2 \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\nand subsequently\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\- \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\\\\,.\n$$\n\n**No. 3, the main point, is that you are starting with a wrong formula for the field energy.** The integral\n$$\nW \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\n$$\nis the energy of a collection of charges in vacuum, which you for example obtain by bringing each charge into position one after the other from infinity and calculating the work you do each time. You cannot use this for the energy in a continuous medium because when building up the charge distribution in the medium you also do some internal work to move the polarization charges that is not accounted for in the above formula for $W$. What you do instead is consider the infinitesimal change of energy when changing the density of free charges by $\\\\delta \\\\rho$,\n$$\n\\\\delta W \\= \\\\int \\\\delta\\\\rho \\\\phi \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\\\\,.\n$$\nThrough $\\\\delta \\\\rho \\= \\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\vec{D}\\\\right)$ and partial integration you obtain\n$$\n\\\\delta W \\= \\\\int \\\\vec{E} \\\\cdot \\\\delta \\\\vec{D} \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\\\\,\n$$\nand work your way onwards from there. For example, for a linear medium you can integrate it to obtain the formula you wish to derive.\n\nI highly recommend you have a look at chapter 4\\.7 in Jackson's \"Classical Electrodynamics\" (the \"Bible\"). Panofsky\\&Phillips, Landau\\&Lifshitz or others will serve you equally well.\n\nP.S.: I like S.I. units in electrodynamics. :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In electrodynamics, when considering the energy of a system with both free and bound charges in a dielectric medium, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The total energy of the system can always be expressed as W = (1/2)\u222b\u03c1\u03c6 dV, where \u03c1 is the total charge density and \u03c6 is the total potential.\n\nB) The energy required to move free charges from infinity to their final positions is given by W = (1/2)\u222bE\u00b2 dV, where E is the total electric field.\n\nC) For a linear dielectric medium, the energy of the system can be expressed as W = (1/2)\u222bE\u00b7D dV + (1/2)\u222b\u03c1_f\u03c6_b dV, where E is the total electric field, D is the displacement field, \u03c1_f is the free charge density, and \u03c6_b is the potential due to bound charges.\n\nD) The energy of a system with dielectric media can always be calculated using the same formulas as for charges in vacuum, regardless of the medium's properties.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately represents the energy of a system with both free and bound charges in a linear dielectric medium. This formula accounts for both the field energy and the interaction energy between free charges and the potential created by bound charges.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the energy needed to create the bound charge system.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's only valid for charges in vacuum and doesn't account for the presence of a dielectric medium.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the energy calculations in dielectric media are different from those in vacuum, as they need to account for polarization effects and the work done to move charges within the medium.\n\nThe correct formula considers the linear nature of the medium and includes both the field energy term (1/2)\u222bE\u00b7D dV and the interaction term (1/2)\u222b\u03c1_f\u03c6_b dV, which are necessary for an accurate representation of the system's energy in a dielectric medium."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/16", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/120337", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/20148/"], "docs_id": 120337, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are studying machine learning via Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Kevin Murphy).

In particular, it is not true that there exists $s'\\\\in S$ such that $s'a\\=s$ (consider what happens if if the kernel of $a$ is not contained in the kernel of $s$). And in any case, nothing you have written would prove that $S^{\\-1}A\\=0$. (Notably, as far as I can tell you have never used the assumption that $V$ is infinite\\-dimensional, so your argument, if it were valid, would work when $V$ is finite\\-dimensional. But the conclusion is false in that case, since all surjections are already invertible $S^{\\-1}A\\=A$.)\n\nHere is the direction you want to be thinking here.

There are clear models available, though these are really only useful for a sediment filter, and even then monitoring the pressure drop across the filter(s) is a better way. \n\nBe sure to install an upstream shut\\-off nearby (if there's not one already) so you can turn it off to change the filter. And pro\\-tip: if you're installing under the sink or other confined location, dry fit it and ensure you'll have enough room to replace the cartridge.\n\n![activated carbon filter block](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yk2qI.png)\n\nFor activated carbon, all you can really do is monitor for taste, and/or change it on a schedule (off the top of my head, at least every 6 months seems reasonable, but check what the manufacturer recommends). The filters are actually rated based on flow rate and the total volume they can handle. \n\nYou can also put the filter upstream of more than just the hot water dispenser (eg, include your kitchen sink cold water as well), and depending on your plumbing and space this might be easier or make more sense. Just be aware of the flow rate (gpm) rating, and total volume. I'd guess for most uses serving the kitchen cold tap only, a 10\" filter would still be fine for this but you do have the option to go to 20\" if you need more volume/flow and have the space."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're installing an under-counter hot water dispenser and want to pre-filter the water to remove chlorine taste and odor.

The documentation recommends using an activated carbon filter in a standard 10\" filter housing for removing chlorine taste and odor. It also advises installing an upstream shut-off valve to make filter replacement easier. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a sediment filter is not designed to remove chlorine taste and odor; activated carbon is more effective for this purpose.\n\nOption B is partially correct about using an activated carbon filter, but it incorrectly suggests it may cause insufficient water pressure.

One way to do this is using the `forest` package:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz, border=5pt]{standalone}\n\n\\usepackage{forest}\n\\forestset{%\n  my columns/.style={%\n    for descendants={rectangle, draw}, \n    for children={no edge}, \n    phantom, s sep=1cm,\n  },\n  % Pick one of these styles\n  hidden empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        shape=coordinate,\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n  x empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        content=\\textsf{x}, draw=none\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns, hidden empty nodes [\n  [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [foo [bar [ [qux [quxx]]]]]\n  [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns, x empty nodes [\n  [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [foo [bar [ [qux [quxx]]]]]\n  [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![hidden empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKmhh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKmhh.png)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[![x empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWvYV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWvYV.png)\n\nOf course, `forest` seems like a bit of overkill in this situation, and leaves you with a slightly odd notation in the source...\n\nEDIT: To make the empty nodes use bullets instead of xs, you can replace `content=\\textsf{x}` with `content=\\textbullet`. In this case you might want to also set `inner sep=0` for empty nodes so that the line touches the bullet. On the other hand, it might be easier to just draw the node as a filled circle, as I've done in the example below.\n\nTo add column headers one option is to add a label to the first node in each column, like `[foo, label={Col 1} [bar [baz [qux []]]]]`. In this case you can control the distance between the header and the first node by setting, e.g., `\\tikzset{label distance=1em}`. On the other hand, if you want to write the column header first you could just remove the box and edge from the first node in each column. The resulting code looks like\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz, border=5pt]{standalone}\n\n\\usepackage{forest}\n\\forestset{%\n  my columns/.style={%\n    for descendants={\n      rectangle, draw,\n      anchor=center, % vertically align (empty) nodes at the middle\n      font=\\strut, % make the box size independent of ascenders/descenders\n      l sep=0em, % make the level height independent of box height\n    },\n    for children={no edge,\n      draw=none, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt, font={}, % style of column header\n      for children={no edge,\n        l=2em, % header distance (minimum 1em)\n      }\n    },\n    phantom, % hide the root node\n    s sep=1cm, % distance between columns\n    bullet empty nodes\n  },\n  bullet empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        circle, inner sep=.5mm, fill, font={}\n        % draw=none, content=\\textbullet, font={}, inner sep=-1pt,\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns [\n  [Col 1 [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]]\n  [Col 2 [foo [bar [ [qux [bar]]]]]]\n  [Col 3 [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![bullet empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaRWu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaRWu.png)\n\nHere I've also added some things to make it so that ascenders and descenders (or lack thereof) don't change the heights of the boxes and so that the empty nodes add the same height to their columns as non\\-empty nodes (even though the empty node itself is smaller than a non\\-empty node)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which LaTeX package and environment are primarily used in the given code to create the aligned column structure for displaying strings of length n?\n\nA) The tikz package with a tabular environment\nB) The forest package with a forest environment\nC) The array package with a matrix environment\nD) The amsmath package with an align environment\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

This eliminates options B and D.\n\nAmong the features listed:\n- Grouping results by number of syllables (A) is very useful for poets and songwriters who need to match rhythm and meter.\n- Including definitions (B) can be helpful for users to ensure they're using the right word.\n- Sorting results alphabetically (C) provides a basic organization that can be useful, though not as critical as syllable grouping.\n- Providing etymology information (D) is the least useful for the primary purpose of finding rhymes, as the origin of words doesn't typically affect their rhyming qualities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as a \"Sound-alike Lexicon\" is not the standard term, and etymology information is the least relevant feature for a rhyming reference."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/20", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/135096", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/20587/"], "docs_id": 135096, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So, I am to analyze this circuit.\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UBxfY.jpg)\n\nSo, this seems easy enough:  \n\n**Node 3:**  \n\n\\\\$v\\_3\\=20 \\\\space \\\\mathrm{v}\\\\$  \n\n**Node 2:**  \n\n\\\\$\\\\frac{1}{110}(v\\_1\\-v\\_2\\)\\+\\\\frac{1}{100}v\\_1\\+2(\\\\frac{1}{10})(v\\_3\\-v\\_2\\)\\=0\\\\\\\\\\\\frac{28}{55}v\\_2\\-\\\\frac{1}{110}v\\_1\\=6\\\\$  \n\n**Node 1:**  \n\n\\\\$\\\\frac{1}{110}(v\\_1\\-v\\_2\\)\\+\\\\frac{1}{100}v\\_1\\+2\\\\frac{1}{10}(v\\_3\\-v\\_2\\)\\=\\-4\\\\$\n\nHowever, when I use, say, Cramer's rule (or wolframalpha) to solve for the equation, we get \\\\$v\\_1\\=\\-67\\\\$, which is unlikely.

One good example would be the\nzero\\-section of a cotangent bundle, but there are others; for example,\nthe exceptional fiber of the crepant resolution of $\\\\mathbb\nC^2/\\\\Gamma$ for $\\\\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $SL(2,\\\\mathbb C)$. From the rumors I've heard, apparently there's some connection between the geometry of the skeleton and the Fukaya category of the symplectic manifold; this is understood well in the case of a cotangent bundle from work of [Nadler](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0612399) and [Nadler\\-Zaslow](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604379)\n\nI'm very interested in the Fukaya categories of some manifolds like\nthis, but the only thing I've actually seen written on the subject is\nPaul Seidel's moderately famous picture of Kontsevich carpet\\-bombing\nhis research program\n\n[![This flaming pile of rubble is my research plans for the next few years](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDMOH.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDMOH.jpg)\n\nwhich may be amusing, but isn't very\nmathematically rigorous. Google searching hasn't turned up much, so I\nwas wondering if any of you have anything to suggest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I noticed this question has been bumped up to the front page, and the\nmost recent answer is about 8 years old: the subject has moved on\nsince then, and more has been written. Here is my understanding of\nsome of the recent developments.\n\nCaveat: This whole area has undergone rapid progress in the last few\nyears, and I am not working on this question, so what I say is\nprobably not up\\-to\\-date (even as I write, never mind in the future).\n\nKontsevich's idea was that you can relate the Fukaya category of a\nWeinstein manifold to the microlocal sheaf category of its\nskeleton. As far as I know, a proof of this conjecture is work in\nprogress by Ganatra\\-Pardon\\-Shende ([one preliminary part of which is\nalready available](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03152)).\n\nI think the idea of their proof is roughly the following:\n\n* You prove that the Fukaya category has a co\\-sheaf property, which\nmeans it can be computed locally first on some subsets and then the\nanswer can be glued together using homotopy colimits. For this, you\nneed suitable functors relating the Fukaya category of a subset to\nthe Fukaya category of the whole manifold. This is complicated by\nthe fact that your \"subsets\" might not be very nicely embedded in the\nwhole manifold: for example, if your ambient manifold is $T^\\*M$ then\nyou want to allow subsets like $T^\\*M'$ where $M'\\\\subset M$ is a\ncodimension zero submanifold with boundary (that's because you\nultimately want to work locally on the skeleton). That is\nproblematic because the Liouville vector field for $T^\\*M'$ and the\nLiouville vector field for $TM$ don't match up nicely. The first GPS\npaper constructs these categories and functors for \"Liouville\nsectors\" (a suitably broad class of inclusions, related to [Sylvan's\nnotion of stops and partially wrapped Floer homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02540)). I think the proof of the co\\-sheaf property is still ongoing work?\n* Now you compute the local pieces of the Fukaya category and show\nthat they agree with the microlocal sheaf categories; since both\nhave co\\-sheaf gluing, you get the same global answers.\n\nThe second part relies on some local computations of Fukaya\ncategories. [Nadler has introduced the\nnotion of \"arboreal skeleton\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4122) which is a skeleton with certain\n\"generic\" singularities. For example, trivalent graphs in dimension 1;\ntrivalent graph times interval or cone on 1\\-skeleton of a tetrahedron\nin dimension 2; etc. He computes the microlocal sheaf category for\nthese; I'm not sure if the corresponding partially\\-wrapped Fukaya\ncategories have been calculated in all cases yet. Finally, you want to\nshow that any Weinstein manifold has an arboreal skeleton:\n[Starkston has some results in this\ndirection which may represent the state of the art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03446).\n\nLeaving this aside for a moment, there are also special cases where\nthe Konstevich conjecture/local\\-to\\-global results for the Fukaya\ncategory has been established independently of this general\nprogram.

The answer also highlights that this is part of a broader effort to relate Fukaya categories to microlocal sheaf categories, with various special cases being established independently by other researchers.

The answer to your question will most likely depend on what you mean by outlier and what procedure will be used to deal with outliers. A few imaginary scenarios:\n\n1. You have photographs of animals and some of them are damaged by technical errors. In this case you would simply discard them from the entire dataset as they would equally be discarded in, as you put it, real world scenario.\n2. You have gene expression data and some genes have abnormally high expression levels. You decide to deal with this by capping the expression at some arbitrary threshold $c$. Since this is a within\\-sample procedure \\- meaning the results will be the same regardless of whether you process each sample one by one or all of them together \\- you can again perform this before splitting into training and testing.\n3. You have similar gene expression data as before with some abnormally high values but you decide to do a cross\\-validation to get an optimal threshold parameter $c$. Now you actually would have to do such outlier \"normalization\" step not only separately for testing and training data, but separately for each cross\\-validation fold.\n4. You have customer data from an insurance company where samples can have missing features. You decide to impute those features using average values from the samples of the same class. Here you would have to perform this correction after splitting into training and testing. And again \\- if you do cross validation \\- separately in each cross\\-validation fold.\n\nIn summary, your general observation about checking whether this procedure would transfer to the \"real world\" setting is on point. Or alternatively \\- you could get intuition by pondering whether a certain procedure can be performed on a single sample (such procedures are called \"in\\-sample\" or \"within\\-sample\" procedures). As an example you cannot subtract a feature\\-wise mean from a single sample because you will get all 0s.\n\nWhen dealing with an \"out\\-sample\" (between\\-sample) procedure you have to make sure that any estimation (a.k.a. \"learning\") is always done using only the data that is being used for estimation (\"training data\"). Then, once you get a value in this training data you have to use the obtained values on the testing data. And yes \\- simple things like centering the data by subtracting a feature\\-wise mean is also \"learning\". So you get the mean in the training step and subtract this training\\-data\\-obtained mean in the testing stage."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working on a machine learning project involving customer data from an insurance company.

This ensures that information from the testing set is not leaked into the model training process, which would lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n\nOption A is incorrect because performing the imputation before splitting would allow information from what will become the testing set to influence the imputation, violating the principle of keeping the testing data completely separate.\n\nOption B is also incorrect for similar reasons \u2013 using the entire dataset to calculate averages would incorporate information from the testing set into the training process.\n\nOption D is incorrect because calculating separate averages for the testing set would not reflect how the model would perform on truly unseen data in a real-world scenario.\n\nThe correct approach (C) maintains the integrity of the train-test split by ensuring that all \"learning\" \u2013 including calculating averages for imputation \u2013 is done solely on the training data."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/14", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/3712", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/41/"], "docs_id": 3712, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm wondering whether there are any good conventions, as far as version control goes, for developing a module that you are using both in a single Magento instance and also are wanting to release as a community module.\n\nInitially what I attempted to do was to use modman to manage the module outside of my main Magento instance repository. But that ended up being problematic on multiple levels. Having a single repository that you can easily install to different environments or roll back in production is extremely useful, and I would even say has become a necessary part of my workflow.\n\nWhat I'm doing currently is developing it inside of my site repository, and am planning to break it off into a separate repository soon.

If you are using SVN to house the production site's code, you should have no problems since Subversion has (practically) no concept of sub\\-modules. It won't mind.\n2. If you are using Git for the production site's code, you will have to use sub\\-modules to \"commit everything\" to the site's code repository. After using modman to clone something like this:\n\n```\nmodman clone ssh://git@bitbucket.org/<user>/<repo>.git\n\n```\n\nYou'll also want to add it as a sub\\-module like so:\n\n```\ngit submodule add ssh://git@bitbucket.org/<user>/<repo>.git .modman/<repo>\n\n```\n\nOnce you have done this, you should be able to add the .modman directory and .gitmodules file to the index and commit it.\n\nAfter cloning the repository which is using these modules installed via modman, simply init submodules and update:\n\n```\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n\n```\n\nP.S.

I like this [one](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/isoreg) for its simplicity.\n\nIsotonic nonparametric is simply your regular scatterplot smoother with the added prior that more $x$ cannot decrease smoothed $y$ (i.e. drug dose vs effects).\n\nFrom the first comment below your design includes a $k$\\-vector dummy variable $z$ (controling for injury,running style) and a continous variable $x$ (days), assuming that $y$ (latent performance) is given by: $E(y\\|x,z)\\=m(x)\\+\\\\alpha z\\+\\\\delta$ where $m(x)$ is a monotone scatterplot smoother, $\\\\delta\\>0$ is known and $\\\\alpha\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^k$. This types of model can be estimated by isotonic GAM (see [this](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.5142&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper implemented [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bisoreg/versions/1.5/topics/bisoreg)).\n\nEdit: i changed the link to the paper, (the old link was pointing to a derivative of the method by the same author)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An athlete's 100m sprint times are recorded daily for 200 days.

If you add to that that a lot of existing C code has been ported to C\\+\\+ and that the C\\+\\+ runtime environment did not offer that many aids to help you avoid memory leaks, you get a vast amount of legacy C\\+\\+ code that is not exception safe.\n\nThe initial lack of awareness about how to write exception\\-safe code also cause a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt, because exceptions worked so differently from the familiar flow control mechanisms that a lot of the common wisdom for writing robust applications had to be critically re\\-evaluated.\n\nNone of these problems exist for C\\# and Java because those languages only came along when exceptions were already much better understood, they have garbage collection so there is one major resource you don't have to look after that carefully and they don't have pre\\-exception legacy code."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why exceptions in C++ are often avoided, in contrast to their widespread use in languages like C# and Java?\n\nA) C++ developers prefer to use traditional error handling methods like return codes for better performance.\n\nB) Exceptions in C++ are more complex to implement than in C# or Java, making them less practical for everyday use.\n\nC) The introduction of exceptions in C++ coincided with a lack of developer awareness about exception safety, leading to legacy code issues and general uncertainty about their proper use.\n\nD) C++ lacks built-in garbage collection, making exception handling inherently more dangerous than in C# or Java.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

This led to a large amount of legacy code that is not exception-safe, as well as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about using exceptions properly. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while performance can be a consideration, it's not the primary reason cited for avoiding exceptions in C++.\n\nAnswer B is not accurate according to the given information.

At some point the PHY transmit timeout will activate and maybe release the RXD high.

When any device pulls TXD low to transmit a dominant state, the receiver will pull RXD low to monitor for collisions. This, in turn, will keep TXD low, creating a latched low state. With multiple transceivers connected this way, the RXDs can drive the TXDs of all connected devices, preventing proper message transmission and reception.

At that time, the PTC resistor will be cold, and have low resistance; by the time it heats up, the supply may have already shut down.\n\nActually, a simple small\\-valued resistor may be all that's necessary. A resistor of 4 ohms (3\\.9 is the closest standard value) would limit the supply to its maximum rated current, but would also reduce the operating voltage of the LEDs to around 6 volts, which would no doubt result in unacceptable dimming and wasted power (about 10 watts). However, you might try just using a 1 or 1\\.5 ohm resistor; this would limit the maximum current to 12 amps while the LED capacitors charged, but only for a few milliseconds; the power supply might just ride that out fine.\n\nI had a similar problem with a switching adapter, but one where the LED string didn't even have the capacitor across the line. In my case, the problem was that the (cheap) switcher couldn't start up under near\\-full load. The solution in my case was to put the on\\-off switch on the 12\\-volt side rather than in the 120\\-volt line.

This is because whenever $a$ and $b$ are numbers,\n\n$$\\\\operatorname{Var}(aX\\+bY) \\= a^2\\\\operatorname{Var}(X) \\+ b^2\\\\operatorname{Var}(Y) \\+ 2ab\\\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) \\= \\\\pmatrix{a\\&b}\\\\mathbb A\\\\pmatrix{a\\\\\\\\b}.$$\n\nApplying this to your problem we may compute\n\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\n0 \\\\le \\\\operatorname{Var}(aX\\+bY) \\&\\= \\\\pmatrix{a\\&b}\\\\pmatrix{121\\&c\\\\\\\\c\\&81}\\\\pmatrix{a\\\\\\\\b}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= 121 a^2 \\+ 81 b^2 \\+ 2c^2 ab\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=(11a)^2\\+(9b)^2\\+\\\\frac{2c}{(11\\)(9\\)}(11a)(9b)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\alpha^2 \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\+ \\\\frac{2c}{(11\\)(9\\)} \\\\alpha\\\\beta.\n\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe last few steps in which $\\\\alpha\\=11a$ and $\\\\beta\\=9b$ were introduced weren't necessary, but they help to simplify the algebra. In particular, what we need to do next (in order to find bounds for $c$) is *complete the square:* this is the process emulating the derivation of the quadratic formula to which everyone is introduced in grade school. Writing\n\n$$C \\= \\\\frac{c}{(11\\)(9\\)},\\\\tag{\\*}$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$\\\\alpha^2 \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\+ \\\\frac{2c^2}{(11\\)(9\\)} \\\\alpha\\\\beta \\= \\\\alpha^2 \\+ 2C\\\\alpha\\\\beta \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\= (\\\\alpha\\+C\\\\beta)^2\\+(1\\-C^2\\)\\\\beta^2\\.$$\n\nBecause $(\\\\alpha\\+C\\\\beta)^2$ and $\\\\beta^2$ are both squares, they are not negative. Therefore if $1\\-C^2$ also is non\\-negative, the entire right side is not negative and can be a valid variance. Conversely, if $1\\-C^2$ is negative, you could set $\\\\alpha\\=\\-c\\\\beta$ to obtain the value $(1\\-C^2\\)\\\\beta^2\\\\lt 0$ on the right hand side, which is invalid.\n\nYou therefore deduce (from these perfectly elementary algebraic considerations) that\n\n> *If* $A$ is a valid covariance matrix, then $1\\-C^2$ cannot be negative.\n\nEquivalently, $\\|C\\|\\\\le 1,$ which by $(\\*)$ means $\\-(11\\)(9\\) \\\\le c \\\\le (11\\)(9\\).$\n\n---\n\n**There remains the question whether any such $c$ does correspond to an actual variance matrix.** One way to show this is true is to find a random variable $(X,Y)$ with $\\\\mathbb A$ as its covariance matrix. Here is one way (out of many).\n\nI take it as given that you can construct independent random variables $A$ and $B$ having unit variances: that is, $\\\\operatorname{Var}(A)\\=\\\\operatorname{Var}(B) \\= 1\\.$ (For example, let $(A,B)$ take on the four values $(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1\\)$ with equal probabilities of $1/4$ each.)\n\nThe independence implies $\\\\operatorname{Cov}(A,B)\\=0\\.$ Given a number $c$ in the range $\\-(11\\)(9\\)$ to $(11\\)(9\\),$ define random variables\n\n$$X \\= \\\\sqrt{11^2\\-c^2/9^2}A \\+ (c/9\\)B,\\\\quad Y \\= 9B$$\n\n(which is possible because $11^2 \\- c^2/9^2\\\\ge 0$) and compute that the covariance matrix of $(X,Y)$ is precisely $\\\\mathbb A.$\n\n---\n\nFinally, if you carry out the same analysis for *any* symmetric matrix $$\\\\mathbb A \\= \\\\pmatrix{a \\& b \\\\\\\\ b \\& d},$$ you will conclude three things:\n\n1. $a \\\\ge 0\\.$\n2. $d \\\\ge 0\\.$\n3. $ad \\- b^2 \\\\ge 0\\.$\n\nThese conditions characterize *symmetric, positive semi\\-definite* matrices. Any $2\\\\times 2$ matrix satisfying these conditions indeed is a variance matrix.

Say $M$ is a smooth Riemannian $m$\\-manifold. Embed $M$ in $R^N$ isometrically. Say $f: M\\\\rightarrow M$ is a diffeomorphism of class $C^k$. Can we extend $f$ smoothly to $R^N$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Q1: Definately not always. More like \"almost never\". If the automorphism extends to $\\\\mathbb R^3$, then the bundle $S^1 \\\\ltimes\\_f M$ would embed in $S^4$. $S^1 \\\\ltimes\\_f M$ is the bundle over $S^1$ with fiber $M$ and monodromy $f$. The most\\-commonly used obstructions to embedding in this case are things like the Alexander polynomial, and Milnor signatures.\n\nI don't see where the metric on $M$ plays a role for this.\n\nIf you want to see automorphisms that extend (and do not extend) for your Q1, take a look at my [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2346). You'll also find some references to several Jonathan Hillman papers that explore such obstructions.\n\nIn the case that your surface is unknotted \\-\\- bounding handlebodies on both sides (thinking of $M \\\\subset S^3$) then the automorphisms of $M$ that extend in this case are well\\-known. They're called the mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of $S^3$. It's an infinite group. Generators are known for it (if I recall, they're the automorphisms induced by handle slides) but off the top of my head I'm not sure how much is known about the structure of the group. Do a little Googling on \"mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of S^3\" and you should start finding relevant material.\n\nTo respond to your 2nd edit, if the co\\-dimension is high enough all automorphisms extend. This is a theorem of Hassler Whitney's. The basic idea is this, let $f : M \\\\to M$ be an automorphism. Let $i : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^k$ be any embedding. So you have two embeddings $i \\\\circ f$ and $i$ of $M$ in $\\\\mathbb R^k$. Any two maps $M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^k$ are isotopic provided the co\\-dimension is large enough $k \\\\geq 2m\\+3$ suffices, for example. So isotope your standard inclusion to the one pre\\-composed with $f$. The Isotopy Extension Theorem gives you the result.\n\nFor example, if $\\\\Sigma$ is a Heegaard splitting / the surface is unknotted, $\\\\Sigma \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^3$ (or $\\\\subset \\\\mathbb S^3$) and you have an automorphism $f : \\\\Sigma \\\\to \\\\Sigma$ a neccessary and sufficient condition for $f$ to extend to $\\\\mathbb R^3$ (or a side\\-preserving automorphism of the pair $(S^3,\\\\Sigma)$ in the $S^3$ case) is that if $C \\\\subset \\\\Sigma$ is a curve that bounds a disc on either the inside or outside of $\\\\Sigma$ respectively, then $f(C)$ bounds a disc on the inside or outside of $\\\\Sigma$ respectively (here I'm using inside/outside re the Jordan\\-Brouwer separation theorem). Since the fundamental group of the complement is just a free product of infinite cyclic groups this is something that can be checked rather easily provided you know the map $f$ well enough."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a smooth Riemannian surface M embedded in R\u00b3. Which of the following statements is true regarding diffeomorphisms f: M \u2192 M of class C^(k\u22652) and their extensions to R\u00b3?\n\nA) All diffeomorphisms f: M \u2192 M can always be smoothly extended to R\u00b3.\n\nB) No diffeomorphisms f: M \u2192 M can ever be smoothly extended to R\u00b3.\n\nC) For surfaces that bound handlebodies on both sides (unknotted), only a finite group of diffeomorphisms can be extended to R\u00b3.\n\nD) For surfaces that bound handlebodies on both sides (unknotted), an infinite group of diffeomorphisms can be extended to R\u00b3, known as the mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of S\u00b3.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation states that for surfaces that are unknotted (bounding handlebodies on both sides), the automorphisms that extend to R\u00b3 form an infinite group known as the mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of S\u00b3. This group is well-known and has known generators, although its full structure may not be completely understood.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that not all diffeomorphisms can be extended, using the phrase \"Definitely not always. More like 'almost never'.\"\n\nAnswer B is too extreme, as some diffeomorphisms can indeed be extended under certain conditions.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the group of extendable diffeomorphisms for unknotted surfaces is described as infinite, not finite.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the conditions under which diffeomorphisms of surfaces in R\u00b3 can be extended, focusing on the special case of unknotted surfaces and the associated mapping class group."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/12", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/336767", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/176232/"], "docs_id": 336767, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: sample file content:\n\n```\n--------------------\nNETWORKING=yes\nHOSTNAME=wls1.ebs-testsrvrs.com\n# oracle-rdbms-server-12cR1-preinstall : Add NOZEROCONF=yes\nNOZEROCONF=yes\n--------------------\n\n```\n\nI want to comment all the lines that start with \"HOST\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In `vi`:\n\n```none\n:%s/^HOST/#&/\n\n```\n\nor\n\n```none\n:g/^HOST/s//#&/\n\n```\n\nThe `%` in the first command means \"in the whole buffer\", and is a short way of saying `1,$`, i.e. from the first line to the last. `&` in the replacement part of the substitution will be replaced by the whole text matched by the pattern (`^HOST`).\n\nThe second command applies the substitution (`s///`) to all lines matching `^HOST` using the global (`g`) command, which `vi` inherited from the `ed` line editor.

But is SE going to go out of their way to enforce it? I highly doubt it.

It allows the company to avoid potential liability or trouble with governments that may prohibit access to the Network. The clause puts the responsibility on the user to ensure they are legally permitted to access the service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the interpretation indicates that StackExchange is unlikely to actively enforce such restrictions, especially for countries with laws that conflict with American business practices.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Terms of Service explicitly state that the agreement is void where prohibited by law, implying that circumventing blocks would indeed violate the terms.\n\nOption D is incorrect as there's no mention of StackExchange having an obligation to report users, and this would conflict with the idea that the clause is primarily for StackExchange's protection rather than active enforcement."}}
