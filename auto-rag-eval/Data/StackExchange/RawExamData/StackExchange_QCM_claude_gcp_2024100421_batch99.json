The answer is obviously yes. This question is more about the feasibility of managing all duplicates, and the implications of that.*\n\n---\n\nSO generates a lot of traffic. Questions on the front page stay for about 15\\-30 minutes max, during which most of them get around 3 answers. It is hard to answer a question without checking new questions very often, since they get answers so fast.\n\nIt works well this way; most questions (apart from exotic ones) get correct answers, very fast. \n\nMany questions are duplicates, but only a few seem to be \"regular\" or obvious ones. In most cases, it will take longer for someone to find a duplicate question, and vote for it, than for someone else to give a correct answer in the meantime.\n\nThis is a question only about Stack Overflow, because the other trilogy sites don't have such a large volume of users. On the other sites, typically Super User, duplicates are found, and closed quite fast, most of the time before an answer falls on them. But this is possible only because of the much smaller volume of users and questions.\n\n**So the question is: are these duplicates a problem which is out of control when these sites are gaining such volume?**\n\nIs it something to really worry about, or does it work fine this way? People can come and get an answer very quickly, without prior searching, just by asking. For most questions, there will always be people to answer. So from the point of view of someone coming to ask, it is not an issue. For obvious reasons, it is also not a problem for people answering, they get reputation this way.\n\nIt may be an issue from a storage point of view, since clearly duplication means more redundant data. But more importantly, it can be an issue to find an answer without asking a question yourself. With many duplicates, multiple useful answers become distributed over different questions, and it becomes harder to find most of them.\n\n**Extra question following on from these thoughts: should we be worried that the volume of users is finally pushing the site to be much easier to get duplicate answers from, than to search from?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Should we be concerned? Yes. Here's an example:\n\n[How can I achieve jQuery animation queuing?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2283236/how-can-i-achieve-jquery-animation-queuing)\n\nThis is a fairly common question. I found 3 duplicates within minutes of it being asked, and posted them in comments. Note that the first two links I gave have well over 1000 views, hinting at their popularity...\n\nThe question was answered, and not closed. And... The answer is reasonably good \\- I might even recommend it in the future. But since it's attached to *yet another question on the same topic*, it adds still more overhead to the process of finding an answer for anyone who goes looking for one. If the answer had been posted to (or merged into) one of the previous questions, then it could be viewed much more easily by future readers.\n\nThis has the potential to get completely out of hand... Good answers can get less attention than they might have otherwise, mediocre answers can get accepted, and direct comparisons between alternate solutions become more difficult.\n\nBut asking people to *not answer questions* is futile. I think Lance has the right idea here: [we need more merging](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/40313/is-closing-for-duplicates-still-relevant-realistic-on-stack-overflow/40341#40341)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion, what is the primary concern regarding duplicate questions on Stack Overflow as it gains a high volume of users?\n\nA) The site's storage capacity being overwhelmed by redundant data\nB) Answerers losing opportunities to gain reputation points\nC) New users not learning how to properly search for existing answers\nD) Useful information becoming scattered across multiple duplicate questions\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The main concern highlighted in the discussion is that as Stack Overflow gains more users and generates more duplicate questions, useful information becomes distributed across multiple similar questions. This makes it harder for users to find comprehensive answers, as good solutions may be spread out over various duplicate posts instead of being consolidated in one place. While storage concerns are mentioned, they are not presented as the primary issue. The discussion does not focus on reputation points for answerers or new users' search habits as major problems. Instead, it emphasizes how duplicates can make it more difficult to locate and compare all relevant information on a topic, which aligns with option D."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/22", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287614", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/10167/"], "docs_id": 287614, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My new iMac (2017, running 10\\.12\\.5\\) has by default F14/F15 bound to control the display brightness.

It's the only Barbarian skill mentioned that provides immunity to control effects and can break existing control effects like Freeze and Jailer. While other skills like Leap and Ignore Pain are useful, they don't offer the same level of protection against multiple types of affixes.

provided:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of LaTeX packages and environments would be most suitable for creating a wide, multi-column table that fits on a landscape-oriented page and includes footnotes?\n\nA) longtable and tabu packages with a longtabu environment\nB) xltabular and threeparttablex packages with a landscape environment and xltabular environment\nC) tabularx and footnote packages with a sidewaystable environment\nD) array and rotating packages with a sideways environment and tabular* environment\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct answer because it utilizes the xltabular package (which combines features of longtable and tabularx) along with threeparttablex for footnotes.

In locking home users out of some settings like this Microsoft are making some attempt to prevent the horrors of the XP era of unpatched systems where people have turned off updates because they don't understand why they need them and the implications of not getting them.\n\nOn to the guts of your question.

Which method would be most appropriate to use, and what is a key optimization in its implementation?\n\nA) canvas.bringToFront(object) - It checks for intersecting objects before changing z-index\nB) canvas.sendToBack(object) - It optimizes by only moving the object if it's not already at the back\nC) canvas.bringForward(object) - It traverses the stack to find the nearest intersecting object\nD) canvas.sendBackwards(object) - It uses binary search to quickly find the optimal position\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The canvas.bringForward(object) method in FabricJS is designed to bring an object forward in the stack, but with an important optimization. It doesn't simply move the object to the top, but instead traverses up the stack to find the nearest intersecting object. This is evident from the implementation shown in the documentation:\n\n1. It starts from the object's current position and moves upward in the stack.\n2. It checks for intersections with each object above it.\n3. It stops at the first intersecting object it finds.\n4. The object is then inserted just below this intersecting object.\n\nThis optimization ensures that the object is moved only as far as necessary, maintaining proper layering with objects it visually intersects with. This is more efficient and visually coherent than always bringing the object to the absolute front.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bringToFront always moves the object to the top, without checking for intersections.\nOption B is incorrect as it describes the opposite action (moving to back) and the optimization mentioned is not part of the actual implementation.\nOption D is incorrect because sendBackwards doesn't use a binary search, and the question asks about bringing an object forward, not backward."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/06/28", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/228107", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/107699/"], "docs_id": 228107, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the planning stages of installing some engineered hardwood flooring, floating.

I could envision the hallway wall and the living room wall being slightly out of parallel, so that if I started at one end of the living room, by the time I get to the hallway, the boards going down the hallway are slightly skewed. I suppose I could start in the middle of the room, but that would require one row of boards to be nailed/glued down, right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With the hallway leading into the living room and that being a central pathway for people in to that room it becomes a visual CenterPoint. We had a very similar layout at the Church Office where we recently laid flooring.\n\nI would start by snapping a chalk line down the center of the hallway all the way into the living room and start on that line, work backwards from there to one wall, keeping the center line true.

It iterates through the selected options, checks their types, and calculates the price accordingly. For 'field' type options, it directly uses the price, while for other types, it looks up the specific selected value and its corresponding price. This approach ensures accurate calculation of the total custom option price, considering various option types and multiple selections.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes all options have a 'price' key and doesn't handle different option types.\nOption B is incorrect as it doesn't account for options with multiple values (like radio buttons or dropdowns) and assumes each option directly has a price.\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't properly navigate the option structure and doesn't account for different option types or multiple selections."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/21", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/279353", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/36270/"], "docs_id": 279353, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to align two enumerated item lists horizontally like in the post shown [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/9394/vertical-alignment-of-align-in-enumerate), however, my alignment is skewed from one item to the other.

While the inspector didn't find anything broken, he said it was nearing its end of days, and that it was only a matter of time until something broke. As per his recommendation, my apartment complex replaced the unit.**\n\nI live in an apartment unit that's 34 years old, and I'm a little concerned about the state of my furnace and AC unit. I don't know exactly when it unit was installed, but it seems to be showing its age. I noticed an excessive amount of rust flakes and, now that the gas heater is flexing its muscles for the cold this season, some ash. I honestly don't know much about HVAC systems in general, so I took some pictures. Is the condition of my system any cause for concern?\n\n[![Rusty ledge](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)\n\nThis is where most of the rust would pile up. I have cleaned most of it off. Before I did, it would simply drop to the ledge and floor below.\n\n[![Gas burners](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxgHR.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxgHR.jpg)\n\nThis is underneath the rusty ledge, looking at the burners. You can see some of the rust that fell from above, as well as some ash from near the pilot light.\n\n[![Closer view of pilot light, rust flakes, and ash](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWmCP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWmCP.jpg)\n\nA closer view of the pilot light, showing the rust flakes and ash piling up below. The ash was not present before this season when the heat kicked in.\n\n[![Left hole](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTcgu.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTcgu.jpg)\n\nUnderneath the rusty \"hood\" in the first image, there are two holes where it seemed most of the rust would fall from. It was a little difficult to get a good picture of these holes, so please excuse the poor camera work on my part. This is the left one. I'm not sure what the larger bits once were, but they don't look or feel like metal or rust. My guess is that at some point this hole was partially covered by some material that fell apart through the years.\n\n[![Right hole](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HznPk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HznPk.jpg)\n\nThe right hole didn't have the same non\\-metallic flaky bits, but did show a good amount of rust flakes sitting inside. I'm not entirely sure what these holes are for, but again, I'm not very familiar with these systems. It seems like a majority of the rust comes from these holes and drops onto the rusty \"hood\" (first picture). I lightly brushed my finger along the outer rim of the hole and rust eagerly fell out.\n\n[![Floor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZHwy.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZHwy.jpg)\n\nThis last picture is of the floor below the unit. You can see a small section where I dragged my finger through the rust that had piled up. I doubt this picture is very relevant, but I included it to give a scope of how messy this system is.\n\nI know this is a long post, so thank you for reading it through. My question is, should I be concerned about the excessive amount of rust accumulating through this system?

And yes, I do say it something similar to that. I hold back only enough to let them feel as if the decision is theirs. I also make valid statements about things should work, vs how it currently is working, even if I have to research that info first (like you are doing).\n\nIf your landlord is honest, and not a slumlord, you have a good chance to get at least some work done to it, if not replaced. Most furnaces are designed to last around 20 years, so it's a good chance it's been replaced sometime in those 34 years since the building was built. It may simply need a good cleaning and some basic maintenance.\n\nFurnaces usually smell of burnt rust and dust when they first come on for the season. If that odor continues past the first week of steady use, then it's not normal, in my experience.\n\nAgain, letting your landlord make the decision will make you sound like less of a jerk tenant (or worse) and more of a concerned person who knows what you/they're talking about. Just because you got your information of the Interwebs doesn't have to mean anything to them. ;\\-)\n\nSimply making them away of a situation before it becomes a problem will, eventually and hopefully, will get you on their good side.

This approach allows the landlord to fulfill their responsibility of maintaining the property while giving them the opportunity to assess the situation professionally.

(from comment)\n\nIf the customer is being rude about the company or the product, this is just them offloading.\nFor a sarcastic caller, where there is no personal abuse, you can say\n\n> \u201cWe really do appreciate this feedback, Mrs Brown\u2026\u201d\n\nFor a personally abusive caller you can use some form of words like\n\n> \u201cI truly understand your concern, Sir/Madam, but unfortunately we cannot tolerate the kind of language you are using right now\u2026\u201d\n\nI took this expression from [Callcentrehelper.com](https://www.callcentrehelper.com/the-right-words-and-phrases-to-use-with-an-angry-customer-30110.htm) which gives further advice on the right expressions to use with different types of angry customer.\n\nHowever, that website is intended for call centre supervisors. **You should be given training** on what to do with an abusive caller. If you don't have training, then this needs to be raised with management. \n\nIt seems the standard practice is to give three warnings of the type above, and then say \n\n> I am now terminating this call.\n\nand hang up without further comment or apology. Never threaten anything.\n\n[Further advice on what not to say to angry cuntstormers](https://www.callcentrehelper.com/calm-down-dear-words-and-phrases-an-advisor-should-never-say-to-an-angry-customer-99557.htm)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer service representative is dealing with an increasingly abusive caller. What is the most appropriate and professional way to handle this situation?\n\nA) Say \"Watch your language\" and threaten to end the call if the abuse continues.\nB) Ignore the abusive language and continue discussing the product or service.\nC) Give three polite warnings about the unacceptable language, then terminate the call if the abuse persists.\nD) Immediately hang up as soon as the customer becomes abusive.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because saying \"Watch your language\" is inappropriate as it implies authority over the customer. Threatening the caller is also not recommended.\n\nOption B is incorrect because ignoring abusive language does not address the issue and may encourage further inappropriate behavior.\n\nOption C is the correct approach. It involves giving the customer multiple chances to correct their behavior while maintaining professionalism. The representative should use phrases like \"I truly understand your concern, Sir/Madam, but unfortunately we cannot tolerate the kind of language you are using right now.\" After three such warnings, if the abuse continues, the call can be terminated without further comment or apology.\n\nOption D is incorrect because immediately hanging up without warning is unprofessional and may escalate the situation further.

After applying k-means clustering, they notice that the clusters are primarily differentiated along the PC1 axis when plotted against other principal components. What is the most likely explanation for this observation?\n\nA) The clustering algorithm is faulty and needs to be replaced with a different method.\nB) The first principal component captures the most variance in the data, leading to greater separation of clusters along this axis.\nC) There is an error in the PCA calculation, causing all the meaningful information to be concentrated in PC1.\nD) The dataset is not suitable for clustering and should be analyzed using a different technique.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain in the data. PC1 captures the most variance, followed by PC2, and so on. As a result, data points are likely to be spread out more along PC1 than other components. K-means clustering relies on distances between points, so the greater spread along PC1 leads to more apparent cluster separation when plotted against this axis. This is not a problem but a natural consequence of how PCA works in combination with clustering algorithms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clustering algorithm is working as expected. Option C is incorrect because there is no indication of an error in the PCA calculation; this is normal behavior. Option D is incorrect because the observation doesn't suggest the dataset is unsuitable for clustering; it's merely reflecting the properties of PCA and k-means."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/24", "source": ["https://meta.mathoverflow.net/questions/867", "https://meta.mathoverflow.net", "https://meta.mathoverflow.net/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 867, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I think something should be done with the homework questions: there are too many of them now.

I was wondering if there was a way to test for console.log() output. For instance:\n\n```\nfunction_to_test = function(){\n    var person = new Object();\n    person.name = \"Nicholas\";\n    person.age = 29;\n\n    return(person.name);    //Nicholas\n    return(person.age);     //29\n});\n\n```\n\nI know I can have them return as one string, but for more complicated examples I'd like to be able to test the following:\n\n```\nfunction_to_test = function(){\n    var person = new Object();\n    person.name = \"Nicholas\";\n    person.age = 29;\n\n    console.log(person.name);    //Nicholas\n    console.log(person.age);     //29\n});\n\n```\n\nThe Jasmine test looks something like:\n\n```\nit(\"should test for the function_to_test's console output\", function(){\n    expect(function_to_test()).toEqual(\"console_output_Im_testing_for\");\n});\n\n```\n\nIs there a simple way to do this that I'm just missing? I'm pretty new to coding so any guidance would be appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of things that are wrong with your code above. As pointed out, having multiple return statement will not work. Also, when defining a new object, it is preferable to use the object literal syntax over using `new Object`.\n\nWhat you would normally do is something more like this:\n\n```\nvar function_to_test = function () {\n  var person = {\n    name : \"Nicholas\",\n    age : 29\n  };\n\n  return person;\n};\n\n```\n\nUsing the function above, there are a couple of ways you could test this. One it to mock out the console.log object using [Jasmine Spies](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/Spy).\n\n```\nit(\"should test for the function_to_test's console output\", function () {\n    console.log = jasmine.createSpy(\"log\");\n    var person = function_to_test();\n    expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(person);\n});\n\n```\n\nThe other is to test the actual output of the function.\n\n```\nit(\"should return a person\", function () {\n    var person = function_to_test();\n    expect(person).toEqual({ name : \"Nicholas\", age : 29 });\n});\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When testing JavaScript functions that use console.log() for output using Jasmine, which of the following approaches is most appropriate?\n\nA) Use multiple return statements in the function to capture different console.log outputs\nB) Directly compare the function's return value to the expected console output\nC) Use Jasmine Spies to mock the console.log object and verify it was called with the expected arguments\nD) Modify Jasmine's expect() function to capture console.log output directly\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is incorrect because multiple return statements in a function will not work as expected. Only the first return statement will be executed.\nB) This is incorrect because console.log() doesn't return a value, so comparing the function's return value won't capture the console output.\nC) This is the correct approach. Using Jasmine Spies to mock console.log allows you to verify that it was called with the expected arguments, effectively testing the console output without modifying the original function.\nD) While it might be possible to modify Jasmine's internals, this is not a standard or recommended approach and would likely be overly complex.\n\nThe correct method involves using Jasmine Spies to mock the console.log object, allowing you to verify the function's behavior without changing its implementation or relying on actual console output."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/06", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/515135", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/260297/"], "docs_id": 515135, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How to calculate the amount of smoke output from the mq2 sensor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an SnO2 combustible gas (and CO) sensor, not a smoke sensor.\n\nRefer to the (typical) \"Sensitivity Characteristics\" curve in the sensor datasheet.

You'll probably extend this from `Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List`. In this block, create a method\n\n```\n/**\n * Gets the configurable options template if needed\n *\n * @param Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product\n * @return string\n */\npublic function getConfigurableHtml(Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product)\n{\n    if ($product->getTypeId() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable::TYPE_CODE) {\n        return Mage::app()->getLayout()\n        ->createBlock('modulename/catalog_product_view_type_configurable')\n            ->setProduct($product)\n            ->setTemplate('modulename/catalog/product/list/configurable.phtml')\n            ->toHtml();\n    }\n    return '';\n}\n\n```\n\nGo ahead and use a layout update to set the template to modulename/catalog/product/list.phtml as well.\n\nIn your list template (copied from base/default) you need to get the configurable html with our new method. You also need to wrap it in a form (make sure the add to cart button is in there). There should be a product collection somewhere (one for list mode, the other for grid)\n\n```\n<?php foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): ?>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $this->getSubmitUrl($_product) ?>\" method=\"post\" id=\"product_addtocart_form_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\"<?php if($_product->getOptions()): ?> enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"<?php endif; ?>>\n        <?php echo $this->getConfigurableHtml($_product) ?>\n        <?php echo $this->getPriceHtml($_product, true) ?>\n        <?php if($_product->isSaleable()): ?>\n            <p><button type=\"button\" title=\"<?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?>\" class=\"button btn-cart\" onclick=\"setLocation('<?php echo $this->getAddToCartUrl($_product) ?>')\"><span><span><?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?></span></span></button></p>\n        <?php else: ?>\n            <p class=\"availability out-of-stock\"><span><?php echo $this->__('Out of stock') ?></span></p>\n        <?php endif; ?>\n    </form>\n<?php endforeach ?>\n\n```\n\nNow create your configurable block and phtml (as defined in `getConfigurableHtml()` above)\n\nIn your configurable block, override `getJsonConfig()` to add a container class (each must be unique)\n\n```\nclass Namespace_Modulename_Block_Catalog_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n    extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n{\n    /**\n     * Composes configuration for js\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function getJsonConfig()\n    {\n        $config = Mage::helper('core')->jsonDecode(parent::getJsonConfig());\n        $config['containerId'] = 'configurable-container-' . $this->getProduct()->getId();\n        return Mage::helper('core')->jsonEncode($config);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd now in your `configurable.phtml`, create the select boxes, load the json config, and add your container class\n\n```\n<?php\n$_product    = $this->getProduct();\n$_attributes = Mage::helper('core')->decorateArray($this->getAllowAttributes());\n?>\n<?php if ($_product->isSaleable() && count($_attributes)):?>\n    <dl id=\"configurable-container-<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\">\n    <?php foreach($_attributes as $_attribute): ?>\n        <div class=\"option-wrapper\">\n            <dt class=\"title-wrap\"><label class=\"required\"><?php echo $_attribute->getLabel() ?></label></dt>\n            <dd class=\"option-wrap\">\n                <div class=\"input-box\">\n                    <select name=\"super_attribute[<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>]\" id=\"attribute<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>\" class=\"modulename-super-attribute-select\">\n                        <option><?php echo $this->__('Choose an Option...') ?></option>\n                    </select>\n                    <div class=\"options-arrow\"><img src=\"<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/option-arrow.png');?>\" alt=\"<?php echo $this->__('option arrow');?>\"/></div>\n                  </div>\n            </dd>\n        </div>\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\n    </dl>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var spConfig_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?> = new ModulenameProduct.Config(<?php echo $this->getJsonConfig() ?>);\n    </script>\n<?php endif;?>\n\n```\n\nNotice a few other things. The `modulename-super-attribute-select` classname on the the select, the uniquely named javascript var, and the custom `Product.Config()`. In all honesty, I was getting a little stuck, so this last part isn't pretty but it should work.\n\nCreate and include a JS file via layout update. What I did was copy and paste the `Product.Config` object here (copied from `js/varien/configurable.js`) because I was having trouble extending it. There was only one thing that needed changing \n\n```\nvar ModulenameProduct = {};\nModulenameProduct.Config = Class.create();\nModulenameProduct.Config.prototype = {\n    initialize: function(config){\n        this.config     = config;\n        this.taxConfig  = this.config.taxConfig;\n        if (config.containerId) {\n            // Add our special classname for the select to it doesn't conflict\n            this.settings   = $$('#' + config.containerId + ' ' + '.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        } else {\n            // here too\n            this.settings   = $$('.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        }\n        this.state      = new Hash();\n        this.priceTemplate = new Template(this.config.template);\n        this.prices     = config.prices;\n    // ...\n\n```\n\nAnd that should do it.

With B turned off, its collector is effectively an open circuit, preventing current flow through both transistors. This means there's no current through the pull-up resistor, keeping the output voltage high (near Vcc). This behavior is consistent with the NAND gate's logic, where the output is low only when both inputs are high."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/10", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/128745", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/78894/"], "docs_id": 128745, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have imported an Intex salt system for use on a locally purchased intex pool. when I received it , the plug is a GFCI plug with a test and reset button on it. the pump is a 230w pump.

Even though the voltage can be adjusted using a step-down transformer, this does not address the frequency mismatch. As a result, the US-designed pump, which is meant to operate at 60Hz, will run approximately 27% slower when connected to the 50Hz power supply in New Zealand. This frequency difference can affect not only the pump's performance but also other electronic components in the salt system, potentially causing them to malfunction or not work at all.

This power consumption results in minimal heat generation, which is significantly less than during normal operation and unlikely to cause any hardware damage. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sleep mode does consume some power, unlike when the PC is completely off. \n\nAnswer B overstates the heat generation in sleep mode; the minimal power consumption does not lead to significant heat that could damage hardware. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because sleep mode specifically maintains power to RAM to preserve its contents, and does not completely cut off power to all components."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/12", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/152571", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/16275/"], "docs_id": 152571, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Researching distributed source control management (specifically mercurial).\nMy question is more or less **what is the best practice for rejecting entire sets of code that fail testing?**\n\n**Example:**\n\nA team is working on a hello world program. They have testers and a scheduled release coming up with specific features planned. \n\n```\nUpcoming Release:\n   Add feature A\n   Add feature B\n   Add feature C\n\n```\n\nSo, the developers make their clones for their features, do the work and merge them into a QA repo for the testers to scrutinize. \n\nLet's say the testers report back that \"Feature B is incomplete and in fact dangerous\", and they would like to retest A and C.\n\n![Repo Doodle](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DteiT.png)\n\n**End example.**\n\nWhat's the best way to do all this so that feature B can easily be removed and you end up with a new repo that contains only feature A and C merged together?\n\nRecreate the test repo? Back out B? Other magic?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key here is to come up with a workflow that avoids the situation where \"bad\" code is ever exposed to developers or teams other than those who created it. If this were to occur, good code would be mixed with bad, and \"unmerging\" or detangling them will be difficult. So, prevent this from happening in the first place.\n\nI'm assuming that HelloWorld in this example is the mainline repository, that contains known good code. Developers A, B, and C all clone from this repo and develop their changes against it. In the model I'm describing, HelloWorld\\-test is a transient repo solely used by QA to test merged changes before moving them into the mainline. Developers never look at HelloWorld\\-test. Here's how it works.\n\n* A, B, and C all clone good code from mainline (HelloWorld).\n* A makes changes and tells QA she's ready (or A pushes her changes to a staging repo). QA clones mainline and pulls and merges A's changes, and then builds and tests. Assuming this is all successful, QA then merges these changes into the mainline.\n* B now makes his changes available. QA clones mainline and then pulls and merges B's changes into HelloWorld\\-test. Continuing with your example, let's say these changes are bad. So QA's merge fails, or the build fails, or the tests fail, or something. At this point QA declares the changes to be bad, notifies B, and simply throws away HelloWorld\\-test. It's now B's responsibility to pull and merge from mainline, fix test failures, or whatever.\n* QA can then perform the process with C, starting from a fresh clone of mainline, and merging in C's changes. Note that B's bad changes have never reached the mainline and so C's changes (or anybody else's) will never be mixed with them.\n* At some point B has fixed up his changes and asks QA to do another pull/merge/build/test. QA can do this next, or they can just go around the cycle of different developers or teams until they come back to B.\n\nThis is often called a \"pull model\" of development. I believe Linux kernel changes are managed this way.\n\nIn many cases it's not \"QA\" who does the pull/merge/build/test cycle, but instead it's done by a continuous integration system such as Hudson or Jenkins.\n\nOf course, there are many variations of this, whether individual developers or teams have staging repos, whether changes are propagated via pushing or pulling, etc. But they should all share these key characteristics:\n\n1. Only known good changes make it into the mainline.\n2. Developers only pull/clone from mainline, thus they never base their work on bad changes.\n3. New changes are merged, built, and tested in isolation from everything else and are verified good before being merged into the mainline."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is using a distributed version control system for their project.

Which of the following approaches best achieves this goal?\n\nA) Merge all feature branches into a single QA branch, then cherry-pick the good commits into the main branch.\n\nB) Have QA create a new branch for each feature, merge the feature into it, test, and only merge successful features into the main branch.\n\nC) Developers push all changes directly to the main branch, and QA reverts bad commits after testing.\n\nD) QA clones the main branch, pulls and merges each feature separately for testing, and only merges successful features back into the main branch.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D represents the \"pull model\" described in the documentation. This approach ensures that:\n1. Only known good changes make it into the main branch.\n2. Developers always base their work on the known good main branch.\n3. New changes are tested in isolation before being merged into the main branch.\n\nOption A could lead to mixing of good and bad code. Option B creates unnecessary branches and doesn't isolate testing.
