There are 10 different flags and 3 different flagpoles. All of the flags are used. Each flagpole must have at least one flag. How many orderings are there?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's first calculate the number of ways to do this problem when the order of the poles matters. \n\nIn this case, we order the 3 poles in some way, and thus each signal corresponds to one permutation of the 10 flags: First the first flag from the first pole, then the second flag from the first pole, until the last flag from the first pole, then the first flag from the second pole a.s.o.\n\nHowever, each permutation of the 10 flags corresponds to multiple signals, because to get back the signal from the permutation one needs to decide after which flag the first and second pole end. Since each pole cannot be empty, the last flag of each pole is well defined, and the second pole cannot end after the 10th flag. So we have $9 \\\\choose 2$ ways to choose the unorderd pair of ending flags for the first and second pole from the 1st to 9th flag.\n\nThat means, if pole order matters, there are exactly ${9 \\\\choose 2}10!$ possible signals. \n\nBut since all flags (and thus the flags on each pole) are different, finding the number of signals when pole order doesn't matter means just deviding the above number by $3!\\=6$.\n\nThat means the answer to the stated problem is that ${{9 \\\\choose 2}10! \\\\over 3!} \\= 19353600$ different signals exist."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: On a cruise ship, signals are transmitted using a system of 12 distinct flags on 4 flagpoles.

First, calculate as if pole order matters:\n   - We have 12 flags to arrange in total.\n   - We need to choose where to place the dividers between poles (3 dividers for 4 poles).\n   - This can be done in (11 choose 3) ways, as we have 11 spaces between 12 flags.\n   - So, we have (11 choose 3) * 12! arrangements if pole order matters.\n\n2. Since pole order doesn't matter, we divide by 4! (number of ways to arrange 4 poles):\n   Final result = ((11 choose 3) * 12!) / 4!\n\n3.

It is probably called **Input Leakage Current I/O pin** and will be near **1\u03bcA**.\n\n[Here is a typical ATmega datasheet used on Uno / Duemilanove / ...](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet.pdf) , you can find the parameter on page 304\\. Check [the datasheet for your specific controller](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/megaAVR.aspx) for accurate details.\n\nIf you use a 3\\.7V battery and a step up converter to supply 5V to the controller, you can connect the battery directly to your controller analog input. However when the output voltage of the step up converter drops below the voltage of the battery (for whatever reason) then your entire Arduino will be fed through the analog input pin and that is what you *don't* want. All input pins have protection against overvoltage which enables this behaviour, but the diodes are not rated for continuous currents. In conclusion: it is best to include a series resistor between battery and input pin.\n\nBut now your measurement relies on the accuracy of the 5V power supply. Depending on which exact controller you have, there are various [internal reference voltages](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogReference) available which are far more accurate than the power supply voltage. If you add an extra resistor to ground (R2\\) you can use such a reference to accurately measure the input voltage. This is called a (resistive) voltage divider.

This allows for using an internal reference voltage for more accurate measurements.\n\nC) Connecting the output of the step-up module directly to the analog input pin, as it provides a stable 5V reference for the ADC.\n\nD) Using a single series resistor between the battery and the analog input pin, which is sufficient to protect the Arduino from potential reverse current flow.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most comprehensive and safe solution. The voltage divider allows for accurate measurement by scaling down the battery voltage to a range suitable for the Arduino's ADC. It also enables the use of a more accurate internal reference voltage instead of relying on the potentially fluctuating 5V supply. The resistors provide protection against reverse current flow if the step-up converter's output drops below the battery voltage. This configuration addresses both accuracy and safety concerns.\n\nOption A is unsafe as it doesn't protect against potential reverse current if the step-up converter fails.

Thus, SL(2,R) is embedded into $O(V,b)$ \\- the orthogonal group of V with respect to the form $b$. \n\nConsider a spin representation of $O(V,b)$, this is a representation in the space of dimension $2^N$.

Maybe you have already figured out a satisfactory answer to your original question, but in case not, here is a purely computational method for finding the decomposition you seek.\n\nBy general weight theory, the weights of the representation of $SL\\_2$ of dimension $2n\\+1$ are $\\\\langle(2n)\\\\beta, (2n\\-2\\)\\\\beta, \\\\ldots,(\\-2n\\+2\\)\\\\beta, (\\-2n)\\\\beta\\\\rangle$ where $\\\\beta$ is the highest weight of the defining 2\\-dimensional representation (Although $\\\\omega$ is more standard for weights, I use $\\\\beta$ here to avoid confusion with the $\\\\omega$'s I use for the weights of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$).\n\nThe weights of the $2n\\+1$ dimensional representation of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ are $\\\\langle\\\\omega\\_1, \\-\\\\omega\\_1\\+\\\\omega\\_2, \\-\\\\omega\\_2\\+\\\\omega\\_3,\\\\ldots, \\-\\\\omega\\_{n\\-2}\\+\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1},\\-\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1}\\+2\\\\omega\\_n,0,\\\\ldots,\\\\rangle$ where the weights after the $0$ weight are just the negatives of the weights before the $0$ weight.\n\nThe embedding $SL\\_2\\\\hookrightarrow SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ that you are interested in takes weights of $SL\\_2$ to weights of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$; in both lists above I ordered the weights starting from the highest weight and working down.\n\nAssociating corresponding weights on the lists, one gets the following correspondence of the fundamental weights:\n\n$\\\\omega\\_1 \\= (2n)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_2 \\= (4n\\-2\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_3 \\= (6n\\-6\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\ldots$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1} \\= (n^2\\+n\\-2\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_n \\= (\\\\frac{n^2\\+n}{2})\\\\beta$\n\nIn general, for $k\\\\neq n$, one gets $\\\\omega\\_k \\= (2kn\\-(k^2\\-k))\\\\beta$\n\nSo how do we use this to decompose the spinor representation $\\\\Sigma\\_n$ (with highest weight $\\\\omega\\_n$) of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$? Let $X\\_i \\= exp(\\\\omega\\_i)$; then the character of the spinor representation of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ can be written as:\n\n$\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_n) \\= (X\\_1X\\_2\\\\ldots X\\_n)^{\\-1}(1\\+X\\_1\\)(X\\_1\\+X\\_2\\)\\\\ldots(X\\_{n\\-2}\\+X\\_{n\\-1})(X\\_{n\\-1}\\+X\\_n^2\\)$.\n\nFrom the weight correspondence above, letting $Y \\= exp(\\\\beta)$ (hence $X\\_1 \\= Y^{2n}, X\\_2 \\= Y^{4n\\-2}$ and so on) one gets the restriction of this character back to $SL\\_2$:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_{2n\\+1}}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_n) \\= Y^{\\-\\\\frac{1}{6}(4n^3\\+3n^2\\-n)}(1\\+Y^{2n})(Y^{2n}\\+Y^{4n\\-2})\\\\ldots(Y^{n^2\\+n\\-6}\\+Y^{n^2\\+n\\-2})(Y^{n^2\\+n\\-2}\\+Y^{n^2\\+n})$\n\nExpanding this product out, one can read off the weights of the restriction as the exponents of $Y$.\n\nFor example, when $n\\=2$ one gets:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_5}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_2\\) \\= Y^{\\-7}(1\\+Y^4\\)(Y^4\\+Y^6\\) \\= Y^3\\+Y\\+Y^{\\-1}\\+Y^{\\-3}$\n\nThis has weights $3\\\\beta$, $\\\\beta$, $\\-\\\\beta$, and $\\-3\\\\beta$, and hence corresponds to the $4$\\-dimensional irreducible representation of $SL\\_2$.\n\nWhen $n\\=3$, one gets:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_7}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_3\\) \\= Y^{\\-22}(1\\+Y^6\\)(Y^6\\+Y^{10})(Y^{10}\\+Y^{12}) \\= Y^6\\+Y^4\\+Y^2\\+2\\+Y^{\\-2}\\+Y^{\\-4}\\+Y^{\\-6}$\n\nThis has weights $6\\\\beta$, $4\\\\beta$, $2\\\\beta$, $0$ (multiplicity 2\\), $\\-2\\\\beta$, $\\-4\\\\beta$, and $\\-6\\\\beta$ and so this is the sum of the $7$\\-dimensional irreducible representation with the trivial representation.\n\nContinuing this, for small $n$, the restriction of $\\\\Sigma\\_n$ splits as $11\\\\oplus 5$ (n\\=4\\), $16\\\\oplus 10\\\\oplus 6$ (n\\=5\\), and $22\\\\oplus 16\\\\oplus 12\\\\oplus 10\\\\oplus 4$ (n\\=6\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the spin representation of O(V,b) restricted to SL(2,R) as described in the passage.

A FXO VoIP gateway is basically a VoIP server that's connected to a telephone line. A FXS VoIP interface is basically a VoIP client that uses a regular telephone as its input and output device. In theory, any device capable of being a FXO server should be able to be a FXS client as well, because the interface hardware is basically the same... but if you can find a FXS adapter, it'll probably be cheaper than buying two FXO servers.\n\nDon't take my word for it without further research (it's been about 10 years since I last looked into it), but I think at least one member of the Linksys SPA\\-3xxx family can be used for this purpose if you buy a pair of them... basically, each box has an ethernet port, a FXO jack, and a FXS jack. You'd configure one of them as a FXO gateway and VoIP server with local LAN IP address \\& connect its FXO jack to the phone jack, and configure the other one as a FXS client that connects to the first \\& plug the phone into its FXS jack.\n\nBe careful with the SPA\\-3xxx (and SPA\\-21xx?) devices, though... some of them are service\\-locked, especially if you buy one that isn't brand new. From what I remember, the only way to know for sure whether it's locked to a specific service is to try accessing its configuration menu... if it's locked, you won't be allowed to change the SIP or FXO settings.

Namely, initial ordinals. The definitions are exactly the same. Furthermore by definition the $\\\\aleph$ cardinals are ordinals, so the correspond to well ordered sets.\n\nOn the other hand, if $A$ is not a well\\-orderable set, then $\\|A\\|$ corresponds to the set $$\\\\{B\\\\mid \\\\exists f\\\\colon A\\\\to B\\\\text{ a bijection}\\\\land\\\\operatorname{rank}(B)\\\\text{ is minimal}\\\\}$$\nWhere the $\\\\operatorname{rank}$ operator is the von Neumann rank of $B$. This set is not an ordinal, clearly, and it may lack any internal structure.\n\nThe class of cardinals, therefore, is combined from two parts:\n\n1. The $\\\\aleph$ numbers which are \"**ordinal which cannot be put in bijection with any of its elements**\".\n\nWe can see that the $\\\\aleph$ numbers do not form a set directly, suppose that they would, then there was an ordinal $\\\\gamma$ such that the set of $\\\\aleph$ has von Neumann rank $\\\\gamma$. In particular all of its elements have rank $\\<\\\\gamma$. Let $\\\\kappa$ be the first ordinal above $\\\\gamma$ such that $\\\\kappa$ is not in bijection with any of its elements, then $\\\\kappa$ is an $\\\\aleph$, but its von Neumann rank is $\\\\kappa\\>\\\\gamma$ in contradiction.\n2. Cardinals of sets which are not well\\-orderable. These are described as sets $A$ such that \"**Every two members of $A$ have a bijection between them, all the elements of $A$ have the same von Neumann rank, and no set of lower rank has a bijection with any element of $A$, and if there is a $B$ of the same von Neumann rank as a member of $A$, and they are in bijection then $B$ is an element of $A$ as well**\"\n\nYes, it is a bit clumsy and unclear, but set theory without choice may get like that often.\n\nIt is immediate that the class of cardinals is a proper class since it contains all the $\\\\aleph$\\-cardinals. Much like in ZFC the cardinals make a proper class, the arguments carry over in this case as well.\n\nLastly, you cannot prove that a power set of a well\\-ordered set is well\\-ordered because if the axiom of choice fails this is simply not true. Furthermore, $A$ itself is a class, as it contains elements of unbounded rank, so we need to be more careful with \"the union over $A$\" as it is not a set as well, that is $V$ itself is a class.\n\nAs $V$ is a class its power \"set\" is not a set and does not exist, and as I remarked power sets of a well\\-ordered set need not be well\\-orderable.\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n\n1.

So why don't absorption and emission lines cancel out in our Sun?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that this is a very good question.\n\nIn my answer I will only mention the formation of one of the absorption lines, the 589 nm of sodium, and I will call the photon associated with that wavelength a \"sodium photon\".  \n\nWhat I will try to explain with reference to that particular wavelength of light will be true for all the other wavelengths for which absorption occurs.\n\nThe schematic layout of a standard demonstration of absorption and emission lines is shown below.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAAwu.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAAwu.jpg)\n\nAt position $A$ one would see an absorption spectrum and at position $B$ an emission spectrum and the \"re\\-radiated in all directions\" explanation works very well.\n\nThe difference with the Sun is that the \"sodium flame\" envelopes the Sun and the rate of \"sodium photons\" emerging from the Sun is less than the rate of emergence of photons with comparable wavelengths.\n\nI think that the OP is asking \"Where do the re\\-radiated sodium photons go?\"\n\nThe fact is that the rate at which sodium photons escape from the \"sodium flame blanket\" around the Sun (the Sun's outer layers) is smaller than the rate at which photons close in wavelength escape.\n\nSo in effect that outer layer of the Sun is fairly opaque to sodium photons.\n\nAs the sodium photons which are being produced in the internal layers of the Sun progress through the outer layers of the Sun they get absorbed and re\\-radiated so the net rate in the forward (away from the Sun) direction decreases and there is a flux of sodium photons heading back towards the Sun.  \n\nHere they interact with the hotter \"inner\" layers of the Sun and do not necessarily emerge again as sodium photons, their wavelength is changed.  \n\nThey are thermalised (I cannot think of a better wording).  \n\nThose sodium photons enter regions within the Sun where they they are in excess of what might expect for the distribution of wavelength for the temperature of those inner layers.  \n\nInteractions within those layers reduce that excess number of sodium photons, so they cease to be sodium photons.\n\nSo the net effect is that the \"sodium flame blanket\" around the Sun sends back towards the Sun sodium photons which are then transformed into photons of other wavelengths.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The absorption lines in the Sun's spectrum are primarily caused by:\n\nA) The complete cancellation of emission and absorption processes in the Sun's outer layers\nB) The reflection of specific wavelengths from the Sun's surface at particular angles\nC) The selective absorption of certain wavelengths by the cooler outer layers of the Sun, with re-emitted photons being redirected or transformed\nD) The inability of certain wavelengths to be produced in the Sun's core due to nuclear fusion processes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

You use `spTransform` to transform those.\n\nThe newer types use the `sf` package, and use functions beginning `st_` to work on them, such as `st_transform` to change coordinate systems.\n\nYou have tried to use an `sp` function on an `sf` data object, hence the error:\n\n```\nunable to find an inherited method for function \u2018spTransform\u2019 for signature \u2018\"sf\", \"CRS\"\u2019\n\n```\n\nWithout knowing exactly how you got an `sf` object (`threeStates`) or what you intend to do with it its hard to give an exact way for you to proceed here.

Is there a way to see from the logcat output when the device started sleeping?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Device is asleep when there is not running application that prevents it from sleeping. So:\n1\\. The screen is off (while it's on there is always some running app, e.g.Launcher)\n2\\. There is no running service (e.g. music, downloads) \\- no CPU locks.\n\nAlarmManager wakes device from sleeping, runs what is to run. It's critical e.g. to ends a service that was created in broadcast receiver from alarm to let the device fall asleep again. If you do sth longer and important in the background you should acquire CPU lock for your app to prevent it from being killed by Android OS.\n\nWhat do you exactly mean by \"How can I verify from which time the command is not executed anymore\"?

As a first step, one can switch to a problem that is somewhat easier, namely that of computing the cohomology of the *homotopy quotient*, $X \\\\times\\_G EG$. Here $EG$ is a contractible space with a free action of $G$. The idea here is that $X \\\\times EG$ is $G$\\-equivariantly homotopy equivalent to $X$ and now the action is free. When $X$ is a point then the homotopy quotient is just $EG/G \\= BG$.\n\nThe cohomology of $X \\\\times\\_G EG$ is what is known as the (Borel) equivariant cohomology of $X$, written $H\\_G^\\*(X)$. This is now a nice cohomology theory satisfying appropriate axioms. An important feature of it is that it is a module over the ring $H\\_G^\\*(pt) \\= H^\\*(BG)$.\n\nIf the group $G$ is a torus then there are some quite powerful tools for computing equivariant cohomology in terms of things like the set of nonfree orbits. A beautiful place to start is the paper of Aityah and Bott, *The moment map and equivariant cohomology*. Topology 23 (1984\\), no. 1, 1\\-28\\.\n\nOne of the theorems you will find explained in there is that the inclusion of the subspace of non\\-free orbits $S$ into $X$ becomes an isomorphism on equivariant cohomology once you localize (in the ring\\-theoretic sense) by inverting the equivariant Euler classes of the normal bundles of the components of $S$. Fortunately, the map from equivariant cohomology to the localized equivariant cohomology is usually injective so doing this doesn't lose any information.\n\nFinally, there is a map from $X \\\\times\\_G EG \\\\to X/G$ given by collapsing $EG$ down to a point. This map gives rise to a spectral sequence that allows one to compute the cohomology of the quotient from the equivariant cohomology and additional geometric data about the action and its fixed points and stabilizers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a compact Lie group G acting on a compact manifold Q in a non-free manner.

In talks and introductory courses, the point of view is overwhelmingly frequentist ([MLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood), $p$ values), but there tends to be a tiny fraction of time dedicated to admire Bayes formula and touch upon the idea of a *prior distribution*, usually tangentially. \n\nThe tone employed to discuss Bayesian statistics oscillates between respect for its conceptual underpinnings, and a hint of skepticism regarding the chasm between lofty objectives, and arbitrariness in the selection of the prior distribution, or eventual use of frequentist maths after all.\n\nSentences such as \"if you are a hard\\-core Bayesian...\" abound.\n\nThe question is, Who are the Bayesians today?

Or even more likely, is Bayesian statistics not so much a branch of statistics, but rather an [epistemological](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/) movement that transcends the ambit of probability calculations into a philosophy of science? In this regard, all scientists would be Bayesian at heart... but there would be no such thing as a pure Bayesian statistician impermeable to frequentist techniques (or contradictions).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to take your questions in order:\n\n> The question is, Who are the Bayesians today?\n\nAnybody who does Bayesian data analysis and self\\-identifies as \"Bayesian\". Just like a programmer is someone who programs and self\\-identifies as a \"programmer\". A slight difference is that for historical reasons *Bayesian* has ideological connotations, because of the often heated argument between proponents of \"frequentist\" interpretations of probability and proponents of \"Bayesian\" interpretations of probability.\n\n> Are they some select academic institutions, where you know that if you go there you will become a Bayesian?\n\nNo, just like other parts of statistics you just need a good book (and perhaps a good teacher).\n\n> If so, are they specially sought after?\n\nBayesian data analysis is a very useful tool when doing statistical modeling, which I imagine is a pretty sought\\-after skill, (even if companies perhaps aren't specifically looking for \"Bayesians\").\n\n> Are we referring to just a few respected statisticians and mathematicians, and if so who are they?\n\nThere are many respected statisticians that I believe would call themselves *Bayesians*, but those are not *the* Bayesians. \n\n> Do they even exist as such, these pure \"Bayesians\"?\n\nThat's a bit like asking \"Do these pure programmers exist\"? There is an amusing article called [46656 Varieties of Bayesians](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf), and sure there is a healthy argument among \"Bayesians\" regarding many foundational issues. Just like programmers can argue over the merits of different programming techniques. (BTW, pure programmers program in Haskell).\n\n> Would they happily accept the label?\n\nSome do, some don't. When I discovered Bayesian data analysis I thought it was the best since sliced bread (I still do) and I was happy to call myself a \"Bayesian\" (not least to irritate the p\\-value people at my department). Nowadays I don't like the term, I think it might alienate people as it makes Bayesian data analysis sound like some kind of cult, which it isn't, rather than a useful method to have in your statistical toolbox.\n\n> Is it always a flattering distinction?\n\nNope! As far as I know, the term \"Bayesian\" was introduced by the famous statistician Fisher as a derogatory term. Before that it was called \"inverse probability\" or just \"probability\".\n\n> Are they mathematicians with peculiar slides in meetings, deprived of any p values and confidence intervals, easily spotted on the brochure?\n\nWell, there are conferences in Bayesian statistics, and I don't think they include that many p\\-values. Whether you'll find the slides peculiar will depend on your background...\n\n> How much of a niche is being a \"Bayesian\"? Are we referring to a minority of statisticians?\n\nI still think a minority of statisticians deal with Bayesian statistics, but I also think the proportion is growing.\n\n> Or is current Bayesian\\-ism equated with machine learning applications?\n\nNope, but Bayesian models are used a lot in machine learning. Here is a great machine learning book that presents machine learning from a Bayesian/probibalistic perspective: [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/\\~murphyk/MLbook/](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) \n\nHope that answered most of the questions :)\n\n*Update:*\n\n> \\[C]ould you please consider adding a list of specific techniques or premises that distinguish Bayesian statistics?\n\nWhat distinguish Bayesian statistics is the use of Bayesian models :) Here is [my spin on what a Bayesian model *is*](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/129712/6920):\n\n*A Bayesian model is a statistical model where you use probability to represent all uncertainty within the model, both the uncertainty regarding the output but also the uncertainty regarding the input (aka parameters) to the model. The whole prior/posterior/Bayes theorem thing follows on this, but in my opinion, using probability for everything is what makes it Bayesian (and indeed a better word would perhaps just be something like probabilistic model).*\n\nNow, Bayesian models can be tricky to *fit*, and there is a host of different computational techniques that are used for this. But these techniques are not *Bayesian* in themselves. To namedrop some computational techniques:\n\n* Markov chain Monte Carlo\n\t+ Metropolis\\-Hastings\n\t+ Gibbs sampling\n\t+ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n* Variational Bayes\n* Approximate Bayesian computation\n* Particle filters\n* Laplace approximation\n* And so on...\n\n> Who was the famous statistician who introduced the term 'Bayesian' as derogatory?\n\nIt was supposedly Ronald Fisher.

We\u2019ll do the race again but this time you start at rest and accelerate with a constant acceleration $a$.\"\n\n\"An observer accelerating with constant acceleration $a$ can outrun any ray of light starting any distance greater than $c^2/a$ behind them\nAnd that means in your coordinates there is an event horizon at a distance $x\\=c^2/a$ behind you. Your spacetime geometry contains an event horizon just like a black hole does, and this fact alone shows that your spacetime cannot be described by the Minkowski metric.\"\n\nBut I am not saying I disagree on it here, but I need to clarify something.\nHe is right from the stationery observer's point of view. But I want to clarify that from the person's view who is on the spaceship, things look differently.\n\nI need to state four things:\n\n1. John Rennie is only right in a mathematical case from the stationary observer's view where we have a theoretical spaceship that can accelerate forever.\n2. As per SR/GR we know that anything with rest mass, as it reaches near the speed of light, will not be able to physically accelerate any more, because it would need infinite energy to do so.\n3. From the view of the person on the spaceship at some FINITE time on his clock, he will then see that the spaceship is not able to accelerate anymore(because he would need infinite energy to do so), it's speed will stay constant less than $c$. After that, the light will catch up to him.\n4. So if this happens at some finite time on the clock of the person in the spaceship, then the stationery observer's clock will show some much bigger, but still finite time, as the spaceship, now from the stationery observer's view, will stop accelerating, and it's speed will stay constant less than $c$. After that the stationery observer will see light catch\\-up to the spaceship.\n\nBecause in theory in John Rennie's explanation of course you can outrun the light, assuming that you can accelerate forever. But in our world, since nothing can go faster than light (because after a while, near speed $c$ the spaceship would need infinite energy to accelerate), at approx $61162111$ seconds (on the person's clock on the spacecraft), he reaches almost the speed of light and stops accelerating, and the light will catch\\-up to him soon after. Because we know that anything with rest mass will not be able to accelerate any more as it reaches close to the speed $c$. So at that point from the view of the person on the spaceship, his speed will not increase anymore and the light will catch up to him.\n\nSo I would like someone to please explain to me why the accelerating twin would outrun light in our world (I proved he can't) and then why is it necessary to use the Rindler metric instead of the Minkowski metric?\n\nMy question is about what he person on the spacecraft will see at $61162111$ seconds on his own clock (supposed the clocks start at $0$).\n\nAnd I am talking about the theoretical case when the spaceship would be able to accelerate forever.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Calculating the clock difference with either the simple SR length contraction will give the same result as if we calculate using this more complicated GR acceleration Rindler metric?\n2. What will the person on the spaceship see on the ships speedometer, when his own clock shows around $61162111$ seconds (supposed that his clock was set to $0$ at the time of start)?\n3. According to SR we know that the person on the spaceship will see his own clock tick normally (as long as he does not compare it to the observer's clock). And he will see the accelerometer showing the constant acceleration too. So at $61162111$ seconds he must see his own spacecraft reaching speed $c$. At that point his clock must stop ticking. So time froze for him?\n4. Since he sees his own clock tick at a normal speed (as long as he does not compare it), is that time freeze sudden? At a certain point? According to SR he having rest mass cannot reach the speed $c$. So he must stop accelerating before that. Then the light will catch up to him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exercise to make everything clear\n=====================================\n\nLet me take a simpler example. Suppose we're talking purely 1D classical mechanics, and you have two particles, one moving with constant speed $u$ and the other one moving with a time\\-varying speed parametrized by $\\\\alpha$, $$v(t) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\~u\\~ t}{\\\\sqrt{u^2 \\+ (\\\\alpha\\~t)^2}}.$$\nWe start off the first one at position $x\\=0$ and the second one at position $x\\=L$ and set them both moving with these speeds in the $\\+x$ direction.\n\n**Exercise**: prove that there is some $L$ such that they will never meet, that the constantly\\-decreasing speed difference means that the time when they actually meet goes to $\\\\infty$.\n\nWhat? Why does that clarify *anything*?\n---------------------------------------\n\nNow what does this have to do with relativity? Well it turns out that the above $v(t)$ is the $v(t)$ prescribed by the relativistic rocket equation, if $u \\= c$. Therefore from the standpoint of the person on the ground, a light ray never catches up with the relativistic rocket if it is emitted behind a certain distance.\n\n(What does that look like from the perspective of the rocket? It looks like there is a black\\-hole\\-like event horizon behind them; these events are being emitted from behind that horizon.)\n\nThe rest of the paradox is just a standard confusion at a sort of *tension* between two ideas in relativity: relativity enforces some form of speed limit where you would need an infinite amount of energy to go faster than speed $c$, but nobody actually *experiences* this limitation *as a limitation*. The very principle of relativity is that nobody is ever saying, \"here is my absolute motion through absolute space\" and so people must experience themselves as being at rest, with light still moving away from them in all directions at speed $c$ in their rest\\-frame, even though it also recedes at speed $c$ in other reference frames that are moving relative to me. But this is the standard relativistic tension.\n\nSome tension\\-relief: it's all about the simultaneity.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI guess my first remark that I like to make to people starting this out is, please pay careful attention to the first\\-order Lorentz transform. Every other Lorentz transform in relativity can be understood as the limit of \"do a little Lorentz transform, then do another little Lorentz transform, then do another little Lorentz transform... repeat until you've built up your whole transform.\" And this is where we see a difference with Newtonian mechanics. Transform by any $\\\\vec v \\= \\[v\\_x;\\~v\\_y;\\~v\\_z]$ large\\-or\\-small, and you will find that Newton prescribes that you convert time coordinates $t$ and space coordinates $\\\\vec r \\= \\[x;\\~y;\\~z]$ according to:$$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl} t' \\&\\=\\& t,\\\\\\\\\\\\vec r' \\&\\=\\&\\\\vec r \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec v \\~ t.\\\\end{array}\n$$However Einstein's crazy idea is that this does not represent what's actually happening when we accelerate relative to each other. Instead for small velocities $\\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\= \\\\vec v/c,\\~\\|\\\\vec \\\\epsilon\\| \\\\ll 1,$ you should transform your time coordinate $w \\= c\\~t$ and your space coordinates $\\\\vec r$ to the values: $$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl} w' \\&\\=\\& w \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\\\cdot \\\\vec r,\\\\\\\\\\\\vec r' \\&\\=\\&\\\\vec r \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\~ w.\\\\end{array}\n$$\nNote that the second equation is essentially unchanged but the first equation now \"looks like\" the second equation in that the velocity is coming in to 'desynchronize' our clocks. This is called the \"relativity of simultaneity\" and I am just mentioning in passing that the other two core effects of relativity, \"length contraction\" and \"time dilation\", really come from adding up the way that these little desynchronizations get transformed and retransformed by these above equations. Then it gets more useful to confine the motion to one particular direction, like $\\\\vec v/c \\= \\[\\\\beta;\\~ 0;\\~ 0],$ in which case you can write that the general result is:\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\nw' \\&\\=\\& (w \\~\\-\\~ \\\\beta\\~x)\\~/\\~\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2},\\\\\\\\\nx' \\&\\=\\& (x \\~\\-\\~ \\\\beta\\~w)\\~/\\~\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2},\\\\\\\\\ny' \\&\\=\\& y,\\\\\\\\\nz' \\&\\=\\& z.\n\\\\end{array}\n$$\nSo, that's what happens when you propagate a ton of these little desynchronizations from little transforms through each other into a bigger transform. These terms $1/sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2}$ appear that start to affect \"here is how long I think your spaceship is, it's much shorter than you think!\" You can derive them a totally different way, by seeing that the cross term $2\\~\\\\beta\\~w\\~x / (1 \\- \\\\beta^2\\)$ is the same for the square of both, so that $(w')^2 \\- (x')^2 \\= w^2 \\- x^2\\.$ This is very important because this property that $\\\\big(w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2 \\\\big)' \\= w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2$ is really a statement about everyone agreeing on the speed of light receding from you: imagine that an event happens suddenly at your location, the light notifying the rest of the cosmos about that event now recedes from you as a thin spherical shell at the speed of light, which means obeying $\\\\sqrt{x^2 \\+ y^2 \\+ z^2} \\= c\\~t.$ Well we defined earlier that $w \\= c\\~t$ and so this number $w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2$ is zero for this expanding\\-light\\-bubble: and what we've just proven is that zero\\-for\\-me means zero\\-for\\-everyone; nobody sees this \"light cone\" that notifies the universe about this event as anything other than a perfect sphere expanding with velocity $c$. So this is what these little desynchronizations are really doing in the background, they're making everyone agree on the structure of these light bubbles, which makes everyone agree on things like causality and stuff.\n\nNow be brutally honest about spaceships.\n----------------------------------------\n\nMy second remark is that we have to think very brutally and physically about what we are describing, if we want to understand what's really going on. What happens to the spaceship that keeps accelerating faster and faster but never hits the speed $c$? Well, let me model its constant acceleration in a simple way: it drops some sort of \"beacon\" and then accelerates until it detects that beacon is travelling away from it with speed $u,$ then it throws down another beacon and accelerates until *that* beacon travels away with speed $u,$ and so on, and so on. To accelerate with constant acceleration, the clock where these beacons are thrown down must be throwing them down at constant intervals.\n\nCombine those two last paragraphs and you realize that trying to outrace a beam of light is a real\\-life Zeno paradox! You accelerate to $c/4$ relative to this beacon, measure the speed that the beam of light is moving away from you, and it's still moving at speed $c$ away. You throw down another beacon, accelerate to $c/4$ relative to that, measure the speed that the beam of light is moving away from you, and it's still moving at speed $c$ away. You cannot win! Therefore nobody can travel faster than the speed of light. These bubbles of light then enforce a very powerful form of **causality** that's not technically present in Newtonian mechanics; it says: no form of matter can get to a destination faster than the information about that matter's history, which moves at speed $c$.\n\nThen, learn to love rapidities.\n-------------------------------\n\nNow when the spaceship tries to measure all of the beacons as a whole, it does not see a straightforward linear progression of speeds: those speeds would go off to infinity, therefore they would exceed $c$! Rather, it sees a progression which goes like a function called the **hyperbolic tangent**, $\\\\tanh x \\= (e^x \\- e^{\\-x})/(e^x \\+ e^{\\-x}).$ In fact if we stick with motion in one dimension we find out that each velocity can be characterized by a **rapidity**, $\\\\beta \\= \\\\tanh \\\\phi,$ and that the velocity addition formula actually then becomes *linear in rapidities*. So that's why you see this hyperbolic tangent pattern in the speeds of the beacons! It's because your single\\-beacon Lorentz boost shifts its rapidity by some $\\\\phi\\_1$, then every other rapidity must be $\\\\phi\\_n \\= n \\~ \\\\phi\\_1,$ therefore every velocity must be $v \\= c \\\\tanh (n \\~\\\\phi\\_1\\),$ for cases of constant acceleration.\n\nFinally, one integral gets the original formula.\n================================================\n\nActually rapidities are even more useful than that, because our expression $\\\\gamma \\= 1/\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2} \\= (e^\\\\phi \\+ e^{\\-\\\\phi})/2 \\= \\\\cosh \\\\phi$ by the variant of the Pythagorean theorem that holds for hyperbolic trigonometry, $\\\\cosh^2\\\\phi \\- \\\\sinh^2\\\\phi \\= 1\\.$ This lets us perform the following integral. We know that the spaceship emits beacons at some interval of proper time $\\\\delta \\\\tau$ and can easily reconstruct the time on the clock $\\\\tau \\= n\\~\\\\delta \\\\tau$ from that plus the number of emitted beacons. Since each time the spaceship gains a constant boost to its rapidity $\\\\delta \\\\phi,$ making everything exact to first\\-order gives the straightforward result that the speed of the spaceship is $v \\= c\\~\\\\tanh(a\\~\\\\tau/c).$ But *our* time coordinates $t$, watching all of this, are going to be different than these $\\\\tau$ coordinates in the spaceship! Well that's where we just integrate: the basic time\\-dilation formula says that $dt \\= \\\\gamma\\~d\\\\tau \\= \\\\cosh(a\\~\\\\tau / c)\\~d\\\\tau.$ Integrating that and discarding the constant gives $t \\= (c/a) \\~ \\\\sinh(a\\~\\\\tau/c),$ therefore its velocity using *our* time coordinates for *our* reference frame is simply:$$v(t) \\= c\\\\tanh\\\\big(\\\\sinh^{\\-1}(a t/c)\\\\big).$$But, one of these basic results from $\\\\cosh^2 \\\\phi \\- \\\\sinh^2 \\\\phi \\= 1$ is that $\\\\tanh \\\\phi \\= \\\\sinh \\\\phi / \\\\cosh \\\\phi \\= \\\\sinh \\\\phi / \\\\sqrt{1 \\+ \\\\sinh^2 \\\\phi},$ so therefore $\\\\tanh\\\\big(\\\\sinh^{\\-1} x\\\\big) \\= x / \\\\sqrt{1 \\+ x^2},$ and the above simplifies to,$$\nv(t) \\= \\\\frac{a t}{\\\\sqrt{1 \\+ (at/c)^2}}.\n$$\nMultiplying both top and bottom by $c$ gives precisely the form in the above exercise I provided with $u \\= c.$ Then we have a perfectly valid reference frame in our ground reference frame, and we know that this spaceship moving with speed $v(t)$ will not be hit by some incident beams of light with speed $c$, if they start out a distance $L$ behind it. All of the rest of the reasoning is identical between classical mechanics and special relativity; special relativity **only** affects how you change between reference frames.\n\nQuick recap\n===========\n\nTo recap, **because** the spaceship is emitting these beacons at constant time intervals, with no concern about its own state; and **because** the universe has the particular desynchronizing structure it has, we discover that *we* at rest don't think that the beacons are emitted at constant time intervals, nor is the spaceship linearly accelerating. Instead we measure the beacons as actually emitted slower and slower, and we measure the velocity of the spaceship as a $v(t)$ curve which as we learn from the exercise above, cannot be hit by light rays from a certain distance $L$ before where it started. **Therefore** we realize that when you accelerate, there is some strange event horizon created at a very long distance behind you, and it gets closer and closer as you accelerate harder and harder. Events from behind this \"wall of death\" contain information that cannot possibly reach you; objects that you pass appear to slow down as they approach the wall of death, getting slower and slower as they fade closer and closer into the wall, never quite falling all the way through. You can only get rid of it by ceasing to accelerate, which will push that wall of death further and further away.\n\nJust to complete the reasoning, John Rennie is claiming that one of the twins must see this wall of death and cannot use an inertial reference frame with special relativity to describe his/her situation; instead he/she needs to use general relativity with the Rindler metric, which basically forces him/her to acknowledge a form of gravitational time dilation is applying specially to him/her. Thereby, both twins agree again."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A spaceship accelerates at a constant proper acceleration a from rest.

You are assuming that the capacitor and the battery have no resistance. In that case, yes, current would be infinite and the time to charge tha capacitor would be infinitely short.\n\nWe don't, however, have ideal components to work with. The battery will have an internal resistance (NOT a discrete part, but caused by the physics and chemistry of the battery.) The capacitor also has an internal resistance (again, this is inherent to the materials.) \n\nThese resistances prevent infinite currents from flowing, and prevent an instantaneous change in voltage.\n\nYou need to use equations that take the effects of the resitances into consideration.\nSpecifically you need to look into the [RC time constant.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant) \n\nThe RC time constant (T) is the product of the resistance (in Ohms) and the capacitance (in Farads.)

However, the K80 is a bit quirky as it is a sort of a 2\\-in\\-1 card and is passively cooled \\- it's really only meant to run in a GPU server. So I decided to pick up an older GPU server, the SuperMicro 2027GR\\-TRF; so far I've installed one K80 but it can support two eventually.\n\nEven so, I've still had some issues around the cooling, which frustrates me because I'm trying to go with the officially supported route for this card. Specifically, if I have the fans set in IPMI to \"Optimal\", I see one half of the K80's temperature just rise and rise (according to nvidia\\-smi) until it reaches \\~93C and thermals off. Not good! Fortunately, the rig has beefy fans, so if I simply set the fans to \"Full\" in IPMI it stabilizes at around 51C but is loud enough I put on protective hearing gear. This is not ideal. Unfortunately the BIOS has no fan options, and IPMI only exposes \"Full\" or \"Optimal\" (at least that pickable), so I don't have a lot more obvious things to try.\n\nNow, I'm new to the server space but I'm surprised that this doesn't seem to be automatic and I'm trying to understand why. I can see that IPMI sees the GPU1 temp (but does not see a GPU2 temp which maybe one might want with the K80?), so I would expect that to feedback into a closed loop for fan control.\n\nI'm puzzled about this and am looking for some understanding around the issue.\n\n1. Is closed loop fan control usually the job of BIOS, IPMI, the OS, or user\\-installed programs? Given the fact the GPU often runs hardest while the CPU is also getting pegged, it seems odd to me that anything other than a dedicated subsystem should be responsible for a critical function like this.\n2. If it is the function of IPMI, is there a standard mechanism to tweak the feedback control? I've seen plenty around controlling the fan speed via setting thresholds, but really what I think I need to set is setting fan RPMs in response to GPU temps \\- maybe make that more aggressive than it currently is.\n\nAnyways, I'd appreciate it if you can help me solve this so that I can keep my hearing...

So I started looking for answers. I had updated IPMI but not BIOS in my quest. Today I kicked it into Optimal via IPMI raw commands and tested it again and ... now it works! It stabilizes right at 60C \\+/\\- 1C.\n\nI had noticed in the past that without the NVidia drivers loaded, I don't think I saw GPU1 Temp engage.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with a combination of update IPMI and NVidia drivers as the probable cause for it working.

The game is a common table\\-top miniature game, where one must roll certain dice in succession but only if you've previously scored a success.\n\nTo give frame to the question, let's assume the following:\n\n1. The initial number of dice to be rolled is 20\n2. If a roll is 'successful' then that die is used in the next round of rolling, and if it is 'unsuccessful' then it is removed\n3. There are 3 rounds of rolling\n4. Round 1 success is determined by a roll of 4, 5, or 6\n5. Round 2 success is determined by a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6\n6. Round 3 success is determined by a roll of 5 or 6\n\nNow the issue I have is that quite often people will look at the overall expected value of the dice rolling game and make assumptions based on this. In our scenario, with 20 dice and consecutive probabilities of success of 1/2, 2/3, and 1/3, the overall expected value of our final successful dice at the end of round 3 would be 2\\.22 (if not rounding to whole numbers).\n\nHowever I'd imagine that the individual variance (if I'm using the correct word here) of any given set of dice rolls would play a far more important role than that final expected value given the relatively small sample space of only 20 initial dice.\n\nSo my question is two\\-fold:\n\n1. How many dice would you have to roll to be relatively certain of getting close to your expected value of final successes?\n2. Given the above example of rolling 20 dice, what certainty would you have in getting that expected value?\n\nFor argument's sake, let's say that I'd like to be 90% certain of getting within 1 either side of my expected value for question 1 \\- and feel free to use the above numbers to illustrate if it's easier.\n\nHappy to answer any clarifications as required!\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:\n\nLet\u2019s take my problem to an extreme. With the probabilities for success as above (50%, 66\\.6%, then 33\\.3%), if I were to roll 1 die my \u2018expected\u2019 outcome mathematically to get three successful rolls would be 0\\.11\\. However, by the end of the three rolls I will either have a value of 0 successes, or 1\\. Both are distant from my expected value.\n\nEven if we increase the number of dice to 10, with a now increased expected value of final successes of 1\\.11, it\u2019s plausible that I could end up with 6 successes overall, which again would be distant from my expected value.\n\nHowever, if I increased the number of dice to 10,000,000, there\u2019s a high probability that my final successes would be close to my expected value of 1,111,111 given the likelihood that many outlying rolls would not confer statistical significance.\n\nSo, at what \u2018number of dice\u2019 rolled does the probability of my final results falling within, say, one standard deviation on either side of my expected value, become 90%? How many dice must I roll before the chances of \u2018randomness\u2019 affecting my overall result is statistically reduced to less than 10% ie. I am 90% likely to achieve final successes within one standard deviation on either side of my expected value?\n\nHope that clarifies it somewhat!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Perhaps the simplest thing to do here is just to compute the probability of every possible outcome at the end of the three\\-stage process. For the sake of broader interest, let me generalise your description of the problem by supposing we have a $K$\\-round process with $n$ initial dice, with $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\theta\\_1, \\\\theta\\_2, ..., \\\\theta\\_K)$ as the respective success probabilities for each round of the process. We will also assume that the successes for each die over each round are independent with these fixed probabilities.\n\nOne simpler way of looking at this is to suppose that you roll all dice in all rounds, but a die is only a success at the end of the process if it rolled successfully in all rounds. This is equivalent to your stipulated process, where dice are removed if they do not roll successfully in a given round. To facilitate the analysis, let $X\\_{i,k}$ denote the indicator variable for a successful outcome with the $i$th die on the $k$th round. Then you have independent indicators with distribution $X\\_{i,k} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bern}(\\\\theta\\_k)$. Let $Y\\_i$ denote the indicator variable for a successful outcome with the $i$th die over all rounds. Then you have independent indicators with distribution:\n\n$$Y\\_i \\= \\\\min (X\\_{i,1},...,X\\_{i,K}) \\\\sim \\\\text{Bern} \\\\Bigg( \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nConsequently, the distribution for the total number of successful outcomes $Y$ for the process is:\n\n$$Y \\\\sim \\\\text{Bin} \\\\Bigg( n, \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nThe mean and variance of the total number of successes is:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}(Y) \\= n \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k\n\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \n\\\\mathbb{V}(Y) \\= n \\\\Bigg( \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg) \\\\Bigg( 1\\-\\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nI will not address your other question regarding the number of initial dice required to get within a certain bound of the expected value with a certain probability. That is not a particularly interesting question and so I will leave it to you to compute from the present functions if it is something of interest. Once you have the probabilities of every possible outcome for any initial number of dice, you can get a good sense of what is likely to happen in this process.\n\n---\n\n**Example:** In your example you have $n\\=20$ initial dice and you have a process with $K\\=3$ rounds with success probabilities $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{2}{3}, \\\\tfrac{1}{3})$. We can compute and plot the probabilities for the number of successes at the end of the process as follows.\n\n```\n#Set the parameters\nn     <- 20\nprobs <- c(1/2, 2/3, 1/3)\n\n#Compute the success probabilities\nPROBS <- dbinom(0:n, size = n, prod(probs))\nnames(PROBS) <- 0:n\n\n#Plot the success probabilities\nbarplot(PROBS, col = 'blue',\n        main = 'Successes at End of Process',\n        xlab = 'Number of Successes', ylab = 'Probability')\n\n```\n\nIn this particular example the mean number of successes is $\\\\mathbb{E}(Y) \\= 20/9 \\= 2\\.2222$ and the variance is $\\\\mathbb{V}(Y) \\= 160/81 \\= 1\\.9753$. The standard deviation of the number of successes is $\\\\mathbb{S}(Y) \\= \\\\sqrt{160/81} \\= 1\\.4055$. (Your intuition about the mean of the process is accurate.) You can see from the barplot that you are most likely to get two successes from this process, slightly less likely to get one or three successes, and so on.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGp5M.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGp5M.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a tabletop miniature game, players roll 20 dice through 3 rounds with success probabilities of 1/2, 2/3, and 1/3 respectively. Only dice that succeed in a round continue to the next. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 successes at the end of the process?\n\nA) 0.2236\nB) 0.2845\nC) 0.3054\nD) 0.1978\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The problem can be modeled as a binomial distribution with n=20 and p = product of success probabilities (1/2 * 2/3 * 1/3 = 1/9). The probability of exactly 2 successes is given by the probability mass function of the binomial distribution:\n\nP(X=2) = C(20,2) * (1/9)^2 * (8/9)^18\n\nWhere C(20,2) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nCalculating this gives approximately 0.2845 or 28.45%.\n\nOption A is too low, C is too high, and D is the probability of 1 success, not 2. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\nThis question tests understanding of probability in multi-stage processes, binomial distribution, and careful calculation."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/09/12", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/172202", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1329/"], "docs_id": 172202, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let me explain. You have a multiple regression using time series data within an econometrics model. And, some of your variables are either dummy variables or interaction variables. So, they take a value of 0 or a continuous value. As an example, let's say one of your variable is the quarterly change in 5 year Treasury rate. And, you disaggregate that variable into two. One would cover the pre\\-Greenspan era from 1951 to 1986\\. And, the other one would cover the Greenspan era to the present. The first variable will show the quarterly change in such Treasury rates until mid 1986\\. Thereafter, it will have a value of 0 or 0%. Someone suggested that instead such a variable in the Greenspan era to the present should not have a zero value, but instead be blank. In essence, creating purposefully missing values. The argument is that this variable does not have a true value of 0% in the specified time frame. Instead, it is truly absent. And, this could affect the magnitude of its regression coefficient or impact on Y. I question this rational on two counts. First, I am not sure that any software could calculate such a regression with variables with different numbers of observations. And, I think there is a very specific reason for that as outlined in my second argument. Second, multiple regressions are resolved through matrix algebra including the use of covariance matrices and the inverting and transposing of such matrices. And, those calculations are impossible with missing values on some of the variables. In my mind, I believe I have already answered this question. Can you tell me if this answer is correct. Or am I missing something. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not that matrix computations are especially finicky: the plain old arithmetical operations they concisely represent are defined on *numbers*. You can't carry out a regression when an observation has a missing value on a predictor; you need to either substitute a number, or omit the predictor, or omit the observation.\n\nIt may assuage someone's doubts to work out the consequences of your coding scheme. For your predictor $x$, let\n\n$$ x\\_1 \\=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ll}\nx \\& \\\\mathrm{pre\\-Greenspan}\\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\mathrm{post\\-Greenspan}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$$\n\n$$ x\\_2 \\=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 \\& \\\\mathrm{pre\\-Greenspan}\\\\\\\\\nx \\& \\\\mathrm{post\\-Greenspan}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$$\n\nThe expected value of the response $Y$ is given by the model\n$$\n\\\\operatorname{E}Y \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 x\\_1 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2 x\\_2 \\+ \\\\ldots\n$$\nwhere the $\\\\beta$s are the coefficients you'll estimate. Now pre\\-Greenspan\n$$\\\\operatorname{E}Y \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 x \\+ \\\\ldots$$\nwhile post\\-Greenspan\n$$\n\\\\operatorname{E}Y \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2 x \\+ \\\\ldots\n$$\n\u2014the intercepts are equal \\& the slopes of $\\\\operatorname{E}Y$ vs $x$ differ in the two time periods, which is, I gather, what you wanted. \n\nAs you say, your method is equivalent to @Wayne's method without the indicator variable appearing as an isolated term, but only multiplied by $x$. Note the constraint that when $x$ is zero, $\\\\operatorname{E} Y$ is the same in both time periods (given equal values of other predictors)\u2014most people would want this violation of the marginality principle to have theoretical support as well as not being discrepant with the data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multiple regression using time series data within an econometrics model, you have a variable representing the quarterly change in 5-year Treasury rates. You want to analyze this variable separately for the pre-Greenspan era (1951-1986) and the Greenspan era to present. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate and statistically sound?\n\nA) Create two separate variables: one for pre-Greenspan (with actual values until 1986 and zeros after) and one for Greenspan era (with zeros before 1986 and actual values after).\n\nB) Create two separate variables: one for pre-Greenspan (with actual values until 1986 and blanks after) and one for Greenspan era (with blanks before 1986 and actual values after).\n\nC) Create a single variable with actual values throughout, and use an indicator variable for the Greenspan era, interacting it with the Treasury rate variable.\n\nD) Create a single variable with actual values for the pre-Greenspan era and zeros for the Greenspan era, arguing that the variable doesn't truly exist in the later period.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is the most appropriate approach. It allows for separate analysis of the two eras without introducing missing values or violating statistical assumptions. This method enables the use of all observations and maintains the integrity of matrix calculations in regression analysis. \n\nOption B is incorrect because introducing blank (missing) values would make matrix computations impossible and prevent the use of all observations. \n\nOption C, while statistically valid, may not capture the distinct effects as clearly as having separate variables for each era. \n\nOption D is incorrect as it loses information by setting all Greenspan-era values to zero, which doesn't accurately represent the data."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/10", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13872", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5246/"], "docs_id": 13872, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking for a way to monitor the power being drawn from the USB ports on my Mac.\n\nSystem Profiler doesn't appear to display this and I haven't been able to find any applications or tools to do the job either.\n\nCan anyone suggest anything (preferably software based)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: USB power consumption information should be available in System Profiler.

This ensures that we're working with an array and prevents the \"Argument #1 ($array) must be of type array, string given\" error. Option A is incorrect because it directly uses $data without ensuring it's an array. Option B assumes numeric keys and may not work for associative arrays. Option D uses the end() function, which, while it can work in some cases, doesn't explicitly handle the array conversion and may have side effects by moving the internal array pointer."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/09/26", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/69335470", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1773603/"], "docs_id": 69335470, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On zsh shell, I put into my `~/.zshrc` the following function :\n\n```\nff () {\n    parallel -j8 find {} -type f ::: $1/* | grep -i $2\n}\n\n```\n\nThe goal is to do a \"parallel\" version of classical `find` function.\n\nBut unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work : for example, in a directory containing `R` scripts, I am doing :\n\n```\nff .

The function is defined as follows:\n\n```\nff () {\n    parallel -j8 find {} -type f ::: $1/* | grep -i $2\n}\n```\n\nWhen trying to search for R scripts in the current directory using `ff . '*.R'`, no results are returned. Which of the following modifications would correctly fix this issue and why?\n\nA) Change the function call to `ff . '**.R'`\nB) Modify the function to use `grep -E` instead of `grep -i`\nC) Replace `parallel` with `xargs` in the function definition\nD) Add quotes around `$1/*` in the function definition\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because the issue lies in how grep interprets the wildcard pattern. By default, grep uses basic regular expressions, which don't treat a single asterisk as a wildcard for matching any number of characters. Using '**.R' provides a pattern that Zsh's extended globbing can interpret correctly, allowing it to match R script files in subdirectories as well.\n\nOption B is incorrect because changing to `-E` (extended regular expressions) wouldn't solve the core issue of pattern matching.\nOption C is incorrect as `parallel` is not the cause of the problem and replacing it with `xargs` wouldn't address the pattern matching issue.\nOption D is incorrect because adding quotes around `$1/*` would prevent proper expansion of the directory argument and wouldn't fix the grep pattern problem."}}
