Choose such a map by picking each of the digits of each integer uniformly at random from $\\\\{ 0, 1, ..., p\\-1 \\\\}$; this is the same as using the additive Haar measure on $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N, (\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N)$. With probability $1$, this map does not have determinant $0$, so its cokernel is a finite abelian $p$\\-group. Let $\\\\mu\\_N$ be the probability measure on isomorphism classes of abelian $p$\\-groups which assigns each $p$\\-group the probability that it arises as this cokernel.\n\nThe Cohen\\-Lenstra distribution is the limit as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ of $\\\\mu\\_N$. As shown in several of the references you link to, it is given by the formula\n$$\\\\lim\\_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mu\\_N(G) \\= \\\\frac{1}{ \\|\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\|} \\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\infty} (1\\-1/p^i) .$$\n\nFor notational convenience, it will help to distinguish between the domain and range of a map in $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N, (\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N)$. I will call the former $U^N$ and the latter $V^N$.\n\n---\n\nNow, to answer your question. Let $A$ be a fixed finite abelian $p$\\-group. Let $e\\_N(A)$ be the expected number of surjections from an abelian $p$\\-group $G$, picked according to measure $\\\\mu\\_N$, to $A$. Ignoring issues about interchanging limits, we want to show that $\\\\lim\\_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} e\\_N(A)\\=1$.\n\nLets start by considering $H\\_N(A) :\\= \\\\mathrm{Hom}(V^N, A)$. The set $H\\_N(A)$ has cardinality $\\|A\\|^N$, as any map is specified by giving the image of a basis for $V^N$. Inside this set, let $S\\_N(A)$ be the surjective maps and $C\\_N(A)$ the nonsurjective maps.\n\nFor any map $f \\\\in S\\_N(A)$, let's consider the possibility that it extends to the cokernel of a random map $U^N \\\\to V^N$. This will occur if and only if the $N$ generators of $U^N$ land in the kernel of $f$. Since $f$ is in $S\\_N(A)$, its kernel has index $\\|A\\|$. So the probability that $U^N$ is mapped into the kernel of $f$ is $1/\\|A\\|^N$. \n\nWe want to compute\n$$e\\_N(A) \\= \\|S\\_N(A)\\| \\\\cdot (1/\\|A\\|^N) \\= 1 \\- \\|C\\_N(A)\\|/A^N.$$\n\nIf $A$ can be generated by $r$ elements, then $\\|C\\_N(A)\\|/A^N \\\\leq (1\\-1/\\|A\\|^r)^{\\\\lfloor N/r \\\\rfloor}$, so the second term drops out as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$. (To see this bound, group the basis elements of $V^N$ into $N/r$ groups of size $r$; the probability that these $r$ basis elements are not sent to the $r$ generators of $A$ is $(1\\-1/\\|A\\|^r)$. This bound is probably much weaker than the true rate of convergence.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a random abelian p-group G chosen according to the Cohen-Lenstra measure, and a fixed finite abelian p-group A.

The correct answer is B (1) for the following reasons:\n\n1. The expected number of surjections e_N(A) is given by e_N(A) = 1 - |C_N(A)|/|A|^N, where C_N(A) represents non-surjective maps.\n\n2. As N approaches infinity, the term |C_N(A)|/|A|^N approaches 0. This is because if A can be generated by r elements, |C_N(A)|/|A|^N \u2264 (1-1/|A|^r)^(\u230aN/r\u230b), which goes to 0 as N increases.\n\n3. Therefore, lim(N\u2192\u221e) e_N(A) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nA (0) is incorrect because the limit is not 0. C (|A|) is incorrect as the limit does not depend on the size of A. D is incorrect because the limit is always 1, regardless of A's structure.\n\nThis result is counterintuitive because for a fixed finite group G, the number of surjections to A is usually not 1. The key is that G is randomly chosen according to the Cohen-Lenstra measure, which gives this unexpected result."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/09", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/226794", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/166080/"], "docs_id": 226794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read all the answers I can find about setting up dnsmasq as a local DNS server for development.

If that is what you are aiming for, then I have some very bad news for you.\n\nThe key point is that you are vastly underestimating the complexity of software.\n\nFirst things first\\-\\-You're ignoring the bigger picture of how your program runs. It does not run in isolation on a perfect system. Even the most basic of \"Hello World\" programs runs on an operating system, and therefore, even the most simple of programs is susceptible to bugs that may exist in the operating system.\n\nThe existence of libraries makes this more complex. While operating systems tend to be fairly stable, libraries are a mixed bag when it comes to stability. Some are wonderful. Others ... not so much ... If you want your code to be 100% bug free, then you will need to also ensure that every library you run against is completely bug free, and many times this simply isn't possible as you may not have the source code.\n\nThen there are threads to think about. Most large scale programs use threads all over the place. We try to be careful and write threads in such a way where race conditions and deadlock do not occur, but it simply is not possible to test every possible combination of code. In order to test this effectively, you would need to examine every possible ordering of commands going through the CPU. I have not done the math on this one, but I suspect that enumerating all of the possible games of Chess would be easier.\n\nThings go from hard to impossible when we look at the machine itself. CPU's are not perfect. RAM is not perfect. Hard drives are not perfect. None of the components within a machine are designed to be perfect\\-\\-they're designed to be \"good enough\". Even a perfect program will eventually fail due to a hiccup by the machine. There's nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nBottom line: Can you write \"Bug free software\"?\n\nNO\n==\n\nAnyone who tells you otherwise is clueless.\n\nJust try to write software that is easy to understand and maintain. Once you've done that, you can call it a day.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Some people commented about an excellent point that I had completely overlooked: the compiler.\n\nUnless you are writing in assembly, it is entirely possible that the compiler will mess up your code (even if you prove that your code is \"perfect\").\n\nA list of bugs in GCC, one of the more commonly used compilers: [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product\\=gcc\\&component\\=c%2B%2B\\&resolution\\=\\-\\-\\-](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=gcc&component=c%2B%2B&resolution=---)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, which of the following is NOT mentioned as a factor contributing to the impossibility of creating completely bug-free software?\n\nA) The imperfection of hardware components like CPUs and RAM\nB) Potential bugs in third-party libraries used by the software\nC) The complexity of multi-threaded programming and race conditions\nD) The possibility of user input errors\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The top answer discusses various factors that make it impossible to create completely bug-free software, including hardware imperfections (option A), potential bugs in libraries (option B), and the complexity of multi-threaded programming (option C). However, the possibility of user input errors is not explicitly mentioned in the answer as a factor contributing to the impossibility of bug-free software.

In fact, it is equivalent to the statement that there are finitely many cardinalities between $\\\\aleph\\_0$ and $2^{\\\\aleph\\_0}$, so it is strictly weaker than the continuum hypothesis.\n\nSuppose that there were infinitely many such cardinalities, then you can let $S\\=\\\\bigcup\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty S\\_n$ where $S\\_n\\\\subseteq(0,1/n)$ has cardinality $\\\\aleph\\_n$ to obtain a contradition.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are only finitely many such cardinalities, then $f(x)\\=\\\\vert S\\\\cap(\\-\\\\infty,x)\\\\vert$ must achieve its maximum, say $\\\\aleph\\_n$ ($n \\> 0$).

In the schematic side of the design, I got confused with the power supply scheme given in the datasheet since I have no prior knowledge about hardware design before. I have looked at two sources about this topic, which seemed a bit convoluted. The first source is obviously the datasheet and it looks like this:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/n3em6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/n3em6.png)\n\nThis is fine up until the caution part below that says 4\\.7uF cap **must** be connected to VDD3 but the problem is the scheme shows the 100nF caps also have to be connected to all the VDD pins. Does that mean I have to connect a 100nF cap to each VDD\\# pin starting from the first and connect an additional series capacitor to the VDD3? But that would just create an open circuit for DC so that can't be it. If I am supposed to connect the 4\\.7uF cap parallel to the 100nF caps that wouldn't be connecting it to the VDD3 since all of the VDD pins are already parallel so I am just connecting another parallel 4\\.7uF to the 100nF caps which includes one 100nF for the VDD3 too or not? I also think by connecting the datasheet means physically connecting so that the 4\\.7uF will be closer to the VDD3 pin.

Probably because a noisy internal peripheral is wired to Vdd3\\.\n\nVdda/Vssa requires a different decoupling because the clock system and analog domain is supplied by this.\n\n*I'd suggest you dive into decoupling capacitors and their placements a bit more before you start routing the board.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing a hardware schematic for an STM32 microcontroller, which of the following statements is true regarding the power supply decoupling capacitors?\n\nA) A single 4.7\u03bcF capacitor should be connected in series with all VDD pins.\nB) 100nF capacitors should be connected to each VDD/VSS pair, with an additional 4.7\u03bcF capacitor connected only to VDD3/VSS3.\nC) Only 100nF capacitors are required, connected in parallel to all VDD pins.\nD) A 4.7\u03bcF capacitor should be connected in series with a 100nF capacitor for each VDD pin.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, every VDD/VSS pair requires a direct connection with a 100nF decoupling capacitor.

I am happy to announce that we have met these goals. As of now, UI and Data changes are live network\\-wide that include showing the relevant CC versions for all post revisions and comments on all sites, updating footers, API updates, and other related sites.\n\nBefore detailing the changes, I will first address some of the open questions that remain [from our last update](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/344491/an-update-on-creative-commons-licensing).\n\n**The previous update defined the license changing from CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 to 4\\.0 on May 2, 2018\\. What happened on this date?**\n\nPrior to this date, the Terms of Service linked to CC BY\\-SA [3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). On this date, the link changed to point to the [4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. It was updated as part of a process that was not led by the Community Team and there was no public announcement at time due to an internal disconnect at the time of the release.\n\n**In that case, what about the change from CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5 to 3\\.0 that took place in [April 2011](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95033/51)? Shouldn\u2019t that also affect a similar change?**\n\nWe can now affirm that the same change in license that was posted on MSE to be effective as of April 8, 2011 (from version 2\\.5 to version 3\\.0\\) also could not have retroactively changed the license of content. The UI update laid out below will reflect this and will attribute each piece of content to the relevant license version.\n\nBased on this, we will be adopting the following rules relating towards classifying the licenses attached to content published on the site:\n\n* Content contributed before 2011\\-04\\-08 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).\n* Content contributed from 2011\\-04\\-08 up to but not including 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n* Content contributed on or after 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\n**How do edits work? Can edits change the license on content that was already posted on the site?**\n\n* Every time that a piece of content is published, the work is published under the CC BY\\-SA version as defined above, based on the publish date.\n* Every time a piece of content on the site is edited by a user, the editor creates a new version of the previous version. The new version of that work is considered to be republished and therefore governed under the CC BY\\-SA version in effect as of the day on which the edit was made.\n* Each revision to a work creates a new version and is licensed separately. Thus current version of any piece of content (that appears on the site) is the most recent revision, and will have a license version based on the date on which that revision was published.\n* This applies regardless of the size, the magnitude, or the significance of the edit that was made (except for the cases outlined below which are exceptions to this rule).\n* New edits do not modify the license that is attached to an old revision of the same content. That old revision continues to be licensed under its original CC BY\\-SA version.\n\nThe UI changes as defined below will make it clear (through the timeline page) the license version that applies to every revision for each question, answer, and comment on all sites.\n\n**Are there any types of post edits that do not cause new licensed revisions or changes to the license on the post?**\n\nYes, there are a few:\n\n* Title or Body Rollbacks: do not create new licensed versions, as they do not add any content to that which was already published. The license on the post changes to the license on the rollback target revision.\n* Tag applications to questions are considered to be meta\\-data and are not included in the content that is being licensed. Thus, tag\\-only edits or rollbacks do not effect any license changes or create new licensed versions\n* The following system\\-initiated post edits do not create new licensed versions:\n\t+ [Commonmark migration](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348746/were-switching-to-commonmark) edits\n\t+ URL Rewrites\n\t+ http to https replacements\n\t+ MSO link to MSE link replacements\n\t+ Insert/remove duplicate link edits\n\n**What license is applied to posts that are labeled Community Wiki?**\n\nWhen attached to a post, the [Community Wiki](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts) label changes the display of the post on the site, and changes the way in which reputation is assigned.\n\nRevisions to CW posts are to be treated in the same way as any other content revisions on the site with respect to the applicable license: licensed using CC BY\\-SA based on the date that the revision is made (which will be identifiable through the post timeline).\n\n**How can users upgrade the license of content that they own on the site from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0?**\n\nWe are thinking about how we might enable users to mass update and republish their questions and answers (across all sites on the network) to change the license version from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0\\. This will require more discovery work on our end so we don't yet have a time frame on if or when this might be available, or how it would work. This feature would not add the ability to republish a subset of content. It would be all or none.\n\n**What will be the process for future license updates? Can I agree in advance to any license upgrades that Stack Overflow might adopt in the future for new content?**\n\nWe will try our best to announce future license updates on the network at least one month prior to their being adopted for new content. This will give time for the Community to react and give feedback on the change.\n\nAny future license version updates will only affect new content (or new revisions published based on existing content) that is published after the new versions are adopted on the network. There will be no way for a user to agree in advance to automatically adopt future license changes to their existing content.\n\n**So what changes have been made?**\n\n1. The timeline for every question and answer has been updated.\n\t1. The top of the timeline page (underneath the title of the post) lists the CC BY\\-SA version of the latest revision made to the post.\n\t2. A new column labeled \u201clicense\u201d has been added to the timeline table.\n\t3. Each line in the timeline labeled as \u201chistory\u201d where the action is \u201casked\u201d, \u201canswered\u201d, or \u201cedited\u201d has the CC BY\\-SA version that is applied to the given revision.\n\t[![Example of license display on the Timeline (some rows removed from screenshot for ](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)\n2.

Comment versions:\n\t1. The tooltip on the comment date includes the license version applied to that comment on creation.\n\t2. If a comment had multiple revisions, the revision display that is available to moderators gives the license version that applied to each revision of the comment.\n4.

This is [implicit](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Attribution_required) from the definition of the \u201cBY\u201d section of the license name.\n\t3. The network footer has been updated to no longer reference version 4\\.0 of the license, and will now link to the [/help/licensing](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing) page.\n\t4. Other references to the license in other sections of the sites on the network have been updated in the same way.\n\t5. Area 51 footer has been updated accordingly.\n\t6. The [create chat page](https://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/new) has been [updated](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/347536/51) accordingly.\n\t7. The [Public Terms of Service](https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service#licensing) has been updated to use the correct format of \"CC BY\\-SA\" (instead of incorrect representations like \"CC\\-BY\\-SA\"). Current license version number (4\\.0\\) is included in text of the ToS (and not just in the link). A sentence has been added to the licensing section making reference to this post to give more details on how licenses are applied to content.\n5.

I don't agree with this measurement style, but I think that participants might interpret \"don't know\" to be \"neutral\" if the scale looks like, on the survey that the participant sees:\n\n```\nstrongly disagree - mildly disagree - don't know - mildly agree - strongly agree\n\n```\n\nIf this is the case, then I think it would be fair to just do one ordinal model, although I think the problem is with the *measurement* being confusing to the participant\u2014not necessarily a statistical issue.\n\nHowever, if the measurement tool placed \"don't know\" on the outside like I've seen others do, e.g.:\n\n```\nstrongly disagree - mildly disagree - mildly agree - strongly agree || don't know\n\n```\n\nThen I think your two\\-step approach is totally valid. It is similar to and in the spirit of hurdle models (as far as I know about them\u2014see the above link for evidence that I am still somewhat confused). The only thing I might change is:\n\n1. Do a multinomial logistic regression, using \"don't know\" as the reference category and collapsing the two agree values together and the two disagree values together. That way you can predict the odds of people moving from don't know to agree and don't know to disagree. This can be done by recoding strongly/mildly agree into \"agree\" and recode strongly/mildly disagree into \"disagree,\" then making \"don't know\" the first level in a `factor` variable that represents this three\\-category dependent variable. I've only fit these models in Stan, but it seems pretty straightforward using the `multinom` function from the `nnet` package, although I would suggest reading up on it to see if everything matches what you think it is doing.\n2. Do an ordered logistic regression, excluding the cases that are \"don't know\" from the sample. This can be done by assigning your dependent variable as `factor` with levels ordered correctly, and then using the `clm` function from the `ordinal` package:\n\n`model2 <- ordinal::clm(dv ~ iv, data = dat)`\n\nThis two\\-step approach is similar to the hurdle model in that you are explicitly modeling two different kinds of processes: First, having no opinion vs. agreeing or disagreeing; Second, level of agreement. \n\nLastly, if you are interested in trying to predict whether or not people have an opinion\u2014regardless of direction (disagree or agree)\u2014then you should do a logistic regression predicting don't know versus any other response.

In its most basic form, work is one of the two basic means of energy transfer between objects, and is the result of the dot product of force times displacement. The other means of energy transfer is heat, which is energy transfer due solely to temperature difference, as you will learn in Thermodynamics.\n\n> And, that if said force is successful, the velocity of the object must\n>  change in response and gain kinetic energy.\n\nWork on an object does not necessarily result in a change in kinetic energy of an object. It is ***net*** work done on an object that results in a change in kinetic energy. The governing principle is the work\\-energy theorem which states that the *net* work done on an object results in a change in kinetic energy.\n\nAn example where work doesn't necessarily result in a change in kinetic energy is work done against mechanical kinetic friction. \n\nSay you apply a constant force pushing a box at constant velocity on a surface with friction. You do positive work on the box giving it energy since the direction of your force is in the same direction as the displacement of the box. But since the box is moving at constant velocity, the work you do doesn't change the kinetic energy of the box. This is because at the same time the friction force that opposes you is doing an equal amount of negative work since its force is in the opposite direction to the displacement. The net work done on the box is zero and there is no change in kinetic energy. What happened to the energy you gave the box? Friction took it away raising the temperatures of contacting surfaces increasing the internal energy of the box and surface (a.k.a friction heating).\n\n> I think that kinetic energy is just the ability to influence another\n>  object\u2019s acceleration by motion.

But insofar as the \"influence\" of kinetic energy is concerned, work can certainly result in the transfer of kinetic energy from one object to another. As far as a \"sign in the work energy theorem\" is concerned, net work can result in either a positive or negative change in kinetic energy. If you bring an object to a stop over a distance \"d\", the force you apply is opposite the direction of the displacement of the object you bring to a stop. From the work energy theorem\n\n$$W\\_{net}\\=F\\_{ave}d\\=\\\\frac{mv\\_{f}^2}{2}\\-\\\\frac{mv\\_{i}^2}{2}$$\n\nwhere $f$ and $i$ indicate the final and initial velocity of the object, $d$ is the stopping distance, and $F\\_{ave}$ is the average force exerted over the stopping distance. Since the final velocity is zero, the work done brining the object to a stop is negative. Negative work means the work has taken energy away from the object.\n\n> The closest I have come in this case is that energy is simply work yet\n>  to be done, but I still have no way of knowing if my intuition is\n>  correct or not from the equation.

And that roadblock begs the question in the title.\n\nPerhaps my responses to your previous statements clarifies this. But with regard to the title of your post, the definitions of fundamental terms don't come from the work energy theorem. It's the reverse.

So in this case you don't need to create your own regular expression pattern, because the proper one is going to be [quite complex](http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html). You don't want to do this.\n\nAnd this is the reason, why you had this problem: even though \"test@test..com\" passess ngPattern validation (but it should *not*, this is *not valid* email address, and your regular expression is [not standard compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address)), it fails on type\\=\"email\" validation (Angular one). \n\nAngular has build\\-in email validation regular expression (this one [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/4ae4cc9d469f0327c6576d8bd8ac7f402ddffa2d/src/ng/directive/input.js#L27)) which you can make use of simply by using input `type=\"email\"`. So in your case to make correct email address validation all you need to do is to remove ngPattern:\n\n```\n<input class=\"form-control input-flat-underline\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" \n        ng-model=\"ctrl.user.email\" \n        required \n        type=\"email\">\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When validating email addresses in an Angular.js application, which approach is most recommended?\n\nA) Use a custom regular expression with ng-pattern directive\nB) Rely solely on the type=\"email\" attribute\nC) Combine ng-pattern with a complex regular expression\nD) Remove ng-pattern and use only the type=\"email\" attribute\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The recommended approach for email validation in Angular.js is to remove the ng-pattern directive and rely solely on the type=\"email\" attribute. This is because:\n\n1. Custom regular expressions for email validation can be complex and prone to errors.\n2. Angular has a built-in email validation regular expression that is more comprehensive.\n3. Using type=\"email\" leverages Angular's built-in validation, which is more robust and standard-compliant.\n4. Combining custom patterns with type=\"email\" can lead to conflicting validations, as seen in the example where \"test@test..com\" passed a custom pattern but is not a valid email.\n\nBy using only the type=\"email\" attribute, developers can ensure more accurate email validation without the need to maintain complex regular expressions."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/29", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/103117", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/25147/"], "docs_id": 103117, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a dual boot with Window 7 (C:) and Windows 8 (D:).

According to the documentation, it's possible to install games on a separate drive and access them from both Windows 7 and Windows 8. However, while the game files themselves will work fine, there may be issues with save files for some games. This is because certain games store save files on the Windows partition, which can lead to separate save files for each OS. To resolve this, users might need to create junctions or relocate the My Documents folder to ensure both OSes access the same save files. Steam Cloud games should work without issues, but not all games use this feature.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the setup is indeed possible.

Also, I haven't found any precise information on this subject on this site.\n\nIf hash performance is bad, I can imagine the following things which may influence the overall performance of the array construct:\n\n1. Total length of cs name\n2. Length of a \"constant\" prefix before the \"significant part\" (i.e. the encoding of `<key>`).\n3. The way `<key>` is encoded.\n\nTo test what form of constructing the cs name for array elements gives the best performance, I made the following test suite:\n\n```\n\\input random\n\n% Three different implementations of a \"hash array\" with numerical\n% keys using different key encodings.\n\n\\input numhasharray.tex\n\n\\input hashnumhasharray.tex\n\n\\input codenumhasharray.tex\n\n\\newcount\\iter\n\\newcount\\rcount\n\\def\\gobble#1{}\n\n% A macro for setting up one experiment to test the \"raw hash performance\".\n\n\\def\\mkhashexperiment#1#2#3#4#5%\n{%\n  \\iter0\n\n  \\immediate\\openout2=#1-setup.tex\n\n  \\immediate\\write2{\\noexpand\\message{starting test \"#1\";

Still the numbers are basically reproducible on repetition.)\n\nThe first (maybe surprising) result is that this amount of variation alone creates a huge difference in overall performance, with a difference of up to a factor **4** in running time. If it was possible to discount the fixed amount of additional processing (I used a counter assignment to access the array value), the difference would probably be much, much larger!\n\nNow I heard that hash performance is particularly bad for sequences of digits, so `\\number` is possibly not a good idea for encoding the array access key.\n\n[Bruno Le Floch gave a comment](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/147966/how-to-implement-low-level-arrays-in-tex#comment336000_147966) in which he describes how to optimize number representation for hashing. This is implemented in the macro `\\hashnumber` and tested by the test cases `testhash19` to `testhash24`. The results:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testhash19\"; size 100000; prefix \"pre\";\npostfix \"\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m2.395s\nuser    0m2.280s\nsys 0m0.052s\n\nstarting test \"testhash20\"; size 100000; prefix \"\";\npostfix \"post\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m2.483s\nuser    0m2.260s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\nstarting test \"testhash21\"; size 100000; prefix \"verylongprefixtostresshashtabl\ne\"; postfix \"\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m4.173s\nuser    0m3.740s\nsys 0m0.056s\n\n```\n\n\\[snip]\n\nThis gives a significantly better result than when using `\\number`:\n\n* The best performance is almost double that of `\\number` (so **8** times better than the worst for `\\number`).\n* The \"spread out\" of performances between different cs name constructions is almost negligible; *even the worst performance for `\\hashnumber` is better than the best performance for `\\number`*.\n\nOf course, I'm intrigued how far this could still be enhanced by choosing a more clever encoding, but I have no clue how to go about this systematically.\n\nIn the hope to \"spread out\" hash keys for encoded numbers a bit more I made an encoding function myself (`\\mynumcode`; see test suite above). It will use a lot of different characters, produce different key lengths and avoid repetitions, which hopefully leads to a better distribution of hash keys. \n\nUsing this encoding, I get the following running times:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testhash25\"; size 100000; prefix \"pre\";\npostfix \"\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m2.194s\nuser    0m1.920s\nsys 0m0.016s\n\nstarting test \"testhash26\"; size 100000; prefix \"\";\npostfix \"post\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m2.089s\nuser    0m2.020s\nsys 0m0.040s\n\nstarting test \"testhash27\"; size 100000; prefix \"verylongprefixtostresshashtabl\ne\"; postfix \"\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m3.594s\nuser    0m3.008s\nsys 0m0.036s\n\n```\n\n\\[snip]\n\nYou see that the timing results are slightly better than for `\\hashnumber`, but not significantly so. So probably this is getting near optimal (for the hashing implementation of the TeX engine).\n\nAs the tests reported above are as near to testing the \"raw performance\" of the hash mechanism as conceivably possible (just storing and retrieving values; loading no additional macros and avoiding all computation), I dare to conclude the following:\n\n1. On the whole, storing array elements as separate macros with constructed cs names is feasible. Compared to the usual runtimes of TeX documents, the best given \"raw\" times for storing 100000 array elements and retrieving random elements for 1000000 times are OK and are probably completely dwarfed by any way in which these 1000000 values are processed further by the TeX system in a real application.\n2. Indeed, using `\\number` to encode a numeric key is not optimal for array performance.\n3. The solution given by Bruno Le Floch for achieving a \"hash\\-optimised\" number encoding assures a significantly better hash performance at small computational cost (see also below).\n4. The total length of the cs name doesn't seem to be significant.\n5. When using `\\number`, inexplicably the overall performance of the array implementation is almost directly inversely proportional to the \"static\" prefix in front of the array access key (much less so for any other number encoding).\n\nComparison of engines\n---------------------\n\nThe test results cited above are with the original TeX engine. I ran the test suite shown above also with other engines.\n\n* `pdftex` gives slightly less performance overall, but really insignificant.\n* `xetex` also gives slightly less performance overall, looking a little more significant (up to **1\\.5** times slower).\n\nWith `luatex` the performance differences are a bit more subtle: cases which are fast with TeX are sometimes significantly slower (up to **2** times slower), while cases where TeX is slow are getting faster, so it seems LuaTeX is better at dealing with those cases (long static prefix) where the original engine is bad.\n\nDoes everything get slower?\n---------------------------\n\nOne more concern about using the internal hash table to store arrays as thousands of cs names is that it will slow down **all** processing due to\n\n1. the fact that the size of the hash table has to be extended for really huge amounts of data, so looking up *any* cs name will take more time;\n2. the fact that the generated cs names \"clutter up\" the hash table, leading to hash conflicts for regular macro names as well.\n\nI tested this by generating the above test suite with setting `\\def\\experimentsize{1000000}` and using the following test file:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n%\\input{testhash1-setup}\n%\\input{testhash25-setup}\n\n\\usepackage{pgfplots}\n\n\\let\\rmdefault\\sfdefault\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\newcommand\\test[1]\n{%\n[can't repeat the example code here because of post length limit]\n}\n\n\\test{1}\n\n\\test{2}\n\n\\test{3}\n\n\\test{4}\n\n\\test{5}\n\n\\test{6}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThe XKCD plot example is taken from [this answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/74881/12850). The intention for using a TikZ example is that TikZ loads a real lot of source code, defining and using heaps of macros, so if anything is wrong with hash performance for normal macro processing, this is one application where it should get most observable.\n\nNote that the `\\input` statements (commented out above) are executed `before` loading `pgfplots`, to maximise potential hash conflicts when loading TikZ.\n\nI had to extend the internal tables as follows to compile the example file with one of the `\\input` statements uncommented:\n\n```\nexport hash_extra=1500000\nexport max_strings=2000000\nexport pool_size=30000000\n\n```\n\nFirst, let's look at the effect of the larger hash table. If I compile the example *with both `\\input` statements commented out* with `time pdflatex` without any extension, I get the following result:\n\n```\nreal    0m3.686s\nuser    0m3.628s\nsys 0m0.044s\n\n```\n\nWith the abovementioned extensions in place, I get\n\n```\nreal    0m3.746s\nuser    0m3.684s\nsys 0m0.052s\n\n```\n\nI would say this is a noticeable (also reproducible) slowdown, but totally insignificant for practical purposes.\n\nNow, the timing result with `\\input{testhash1-setup}` uncommented:\n\n```\nreal    0m19.760s\nuser    0m19.585s\nsys 0m0.140s\n\n```\n\nand with `\\input{testhash25-setup}` uncommented:\n\n```\nreal    0m10.710s\nuser    0m10.585s\nsys 0m0.104s\n\n```\n\nAnd here are the timing results for \"only\" processing `testhash1-setup` with the following test file:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\input{testhash1-setup}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n(Note there will be a small overhead due to starting up LaTeX twice.)\n\n```\nreal    0m15.401s\nuser    0m15.297s\nsys 0m0.084s\n\n```\n\nAnd for `testhash25-setup`:\n\n```\nreal    0m4.218s\nuser    0m4.104s\nsys 0m0.104s\n\n```\n\nSumming the run times of the separate computations and comparing with the joint computation, I get\n\n* For `testhash1-setup`, the sum of both \"separate\" computation times (`usr` timing) is *18\\.981s*, while the joint computation takes *19\\.585s*.\n* For `testhash25-setup`, the sum of both \"separate\" computation times is *7\\.788s*, while the joint computation takes *10\\.585s*.\n\nInterestingly, this means that when the array key is encoded with `\\number`, the following computation is not slowed down significantly, while when using my faster encoding method, **the slowdown is on the order of the original running time of the TikZ example**!\n\nSo this example actually allows to observe the effect of hash table cluttering: As my encoding tries to spread the hash codes for array elements across the whole hash table, the number of hash conflicts for regular macro names increases and indeed **the performance is halved**.\n\nThe results are comparable for the encoding by Bruno Le Floch.\n\nNote however that the experiment setting is really not very realistic, because loading the array code *before* TikZ comes down to setting up data structures before defining the actual document macros, while usually it will be the other way round: First, macro packages and suchlike are loaded and later during document processing, data is stored in arrays which are defined on the fly.\n\nSo what happens when I move the `\\input{testhash25-setup}` *after* the `\\usepackage{pgfplots}`?\n\n```\nreal    0m8.928s\nuser    0m8.809s\nsys 0m0.100s\n\n```\n\nSo the slowdown is still noticeable, but much less than when executing the other way round.\n\nHence, my conclusions from these experiments are:\n\n1. Extending the internal hash table alone doesn't slow TeX down.\n2. Cluttering up the hash table with macros for array elements *does* slow TeX down noticeably.\n3. It makes a difference when macros are defined; the basic packages should come first and the definition of array elements should come as late as possible.\n4. When deciding how to encode array indices, all effects should be taken into account. It makes no sense to trade slightly better hash performance for vastly slower overall run time.\n\nWe haven't even talked about arrays yet...\n------------------------------------------\n\nIndeed, so far all tests were at the \"raw hash\" level, just executing the pre\\-expanded store and retrieval commands. In a realistic application setting, of course the encoding of array keys has to take place at execution time.\n\nThat's the purpose of the macro `\\mkarrayexperiment` in the test suite above: it will generate a test file containing statements like \n\n```\n\\numhashstore{foo}{1}{1}\n\\mycount \\numhashretrieve{foo}{438549}\\relax \n\n```\n\nstoring and retrieving values to/from an array `foo` with the access macros defined above.\n\nFrom the given test suite, I get the following results:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testnumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"numhasharr\nay\" (./numhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m5.472s\nuser    0m5.192s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\nstarting test \"testhashnumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"hashnu\nmhasharray\" (./hashnumhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m3.754s\nuser    0m3.664s\nsys 0m0.032s\n\nstarting test \"testcodenumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"codenu\nmhasharray\" (./codenumhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m5.114s\nuser    0m4.868s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\n```\n\nHere, we can see that the effort for encoding the array keys diminishes the distance between using `\\number` and the hash\\-optimized approach of Bruno Le Floch. My own encoding is disqualified because the effort for generating the array keys outweighs the added hash efficience :\\-(\n\nBut the good new is that even taking the time needed for encoding into account, the approach of Bruno Le Floch beats the array index based on `\\number`.\n\nAre there other approaches?\n---------------------------\n\nI'm interested to hear whether there are other approaches to implementing an array apart from the hash\\-based one studied here which have comparable performance.\n\nThe `l3prop` package offers an implementation of \"property lists\" which could be accessed like arrays. But with a test similar to the above, I got a performance which is totally incomparable to the hash\\-based implementation (100 times slower for 1000 array entries and 10000 retrievals; might even get worse for larger array sizes). So this doesn't seem to be an alternative for storing huge amounts of data.\n\nI tried to devise a simple macro\\-based solution where all entries are stored in a single macro expansion, but unfortunately I couldn't think of any way for retrieving the value of an array entry with any kind of efficiency (I thought delimited arguments could be used for that, but couldn't figure out how).\n\nBut let me speculate a little: Let's talk about *n* array entries with a total content length of *m*. Conceivably, *m\\>\\>n*.\n\nThen all solutions for storing the *n* entries I can imagine fall into two categories:\n\n1. New cs names on the order of *n* are created. This is the solution sketched above, but also, for instance, all kinds of dictionary implementations where nodes of a tree are stored as single macros.\n2. At least one macro whose expansion text is on the order of *m* is created.\n\nClearly, no solution based on the first approach will be more efficient than the simple implementation given above, because that one needs exactly **one** access to the internal hash table, and you can't go lower than that.\n\nBut I think that also no solution based on the second approach can be more efficient, because however you implement it, to retrieve an array element, you'll have to expand a macro whose expansion text is on the order of *m*, and that is clearly slower than a single access to the internal hash table, so there.\n\nBut maybe I'm just lacking imagination, so feel free to present a third solution, or in fact any array implementation more efficient than the simple hash\\-based one.\n\nFinal questions\n---------------\n\nBased on what I know so far, my basic question can be refined as follows:\n\n1. Looking at the actual implementation of TeXs hashing algorithm, what is the best way to construct cs names for maximum array performance?\n2. Is there any fundamentally different method of implementing an array in TeX which gives comparable (or even better) performance than the hash\\-based one?\n3. Am I somehow looking into the wrong direction? Maybe my experiment setup is somehow fundamentally flawed and I'm getting insignificant results? Should I test differently?\n4. I used the original TeX engine for my tests, and am not using any construct specific to any TeX extension. I tested the very same code with other engines, not giving any unexpected or significantly different results. It is rather clear that LuaTeX offers to implement arrays in Lua, hence giving completely different options. Are the other engines (`pdftex`, XeTeX) offering anything which might aid in implementing arrays?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, first let me say that this is probably the most thoroughly researched question I've read so far. Congratulations.\n\nI'll be reusing some of David's comments. The hashing algorithm takes the csname as an array of bytes (probably some differences there for XeTeX and LuaTeX, let me focus on 8\\-bit engines) and computes the sum of `csname[i]*2^(len-i) % prime` where `csname[i]` denotes the `i`\\-th byte in the csname, `len` is the total number of characters, and the result is computed modulo the hash `prime`. The control sequence is then stored or retrieved at the resulting position in the hash table. If there was never any hash collision, then storage and retrieval would be easy and fast, since computing the hash is very fast (additions only). When there is a collision, TeX must check whether the command that it found in the hash table is indeed the csname that was searched for: this is done by comparing strings one character at a time, and is somewhat slower than the hashing algorithm (*I think*). TeX may need to compare all csnames with the same hash (it can stop once it finds the csname it was looking for).\n\nWhen comparing strings which happen to be different but have the same hash, TeX goes through them one character at a time, and can stop comparing as soon as it finds a difference: there lies the difference between a long prefix and a long suffix. In scenarios where there are many hash collisions (e.g., with `\\number`), most of the time is spent comparing strings which happen to have the same hash. If such strings differ on an early character (i.e., short prefix), then they will be recognized as different pretty fast. If they have long common prefixes, then TeX will have to scan them for a long time (until the first difference) before it can declare them distinct.\n\nWhy is `\\number` bad for hash collisions? Say that your array keys are 5\\-digit numbers. Compared to the hash of `00000`, the hash of `abcde` (where `a`, etc, stand for digits) is `16*a+8*b+4*c+2*d+e`. For instance, `98765` has the same hashcode as `00000` plus `16*9+8*8+4*7+2*6+5=253`. This is tiny. In fact, hash codes for all sets of five digits all lie among 280 possible values! A typical hash value corresponds to more than 300 csnames, and on average TeX will have to test half of them before finding the one it wants.\n\nHow do we spread out hashes? The main culprit in having only 280 different values with `\\number` is that Knuth chose a multiplier equal to 2 only. This is justified when names are more or less random sequences of letters of varying length, as in typical TeX documents (adding one character multiplies the whole hash value by 2, so collisions between strings of different lengths are not particularly likely regardless of their internal structure). To choose my encoding, I decided to replace `16*a+8*b+4*c+2*d+e` above by `16^4 * a + 16^3 * b + 16^2 * c + 16 * d + e`. This is simply done by inserting three dummy characters between each decimal digit, turning `98765` into `9---8---7---6---5`. Why insert three rather than more? Because 16 is the smallest power of 2 greater than 10\\. Choosing 8 instead of 16 would still lead to hash collisions: the hashes of `0--0--0--0--0` and `9--9--9--9--9` are only `9*8^4+9*8^3+...+9=42129` apart, so a typical hash would correspond to two or three csnames.\n\nThe last step was simply to convert this to code:\n\n```\n\\def\\step#1{#1---\\step}\n\\def\\endstep#1\\step{}\n\\message{\\step 123 \\endstep}\n\n```\n\nHere I use a typical technique to optimize loops: define the looping macro to do what you want and call itself again (here we want `#1->#1---`), then figure out what to feed as `#1` to break the loop. This avoids any test hence is as fast as can be while supporting an arbitrary length of input. Note also that I am putting dashes after the digit (`#1---` instead of `---#1`) in an effort to put relevant stuff early in the csname.\n\nFor the specific application of inserting stuff within numbers, we might be able to do better (haven't benchmarked): numbers will not have more than 10 digits (actually 6 might be a reasonable bound, so remove `#6` through `#9`). The following should work and may be faster\n\n```\n\\def\\dashes#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9{#1---#2---#3---#4---#5---#6---#7---#8---#9---}\n\\message{\\dashes 123********}\n\n```\n\n(at least 8 stars after the number, to support numbers of arbitrary lengths between 1 and 10\\).\n\nYet another option is to use `\\romannumeral` on each digit, which reduces hash collisions because lengths vary. I don't know how this fares.\n\nOne thing is certain: csnames of the form `<prefix><varying><postfix>` of a constant length can have `256*2^(len-1)` different hashes (where `len` is the length of the varying part), and more realistically `10*2^(len-1)` hashes only. Getting `10^5` distinct hashes absolutely requires 10 varying bytes, or some variation on the length of the prefix, varying or postfix parts. In practical settings (where key encoding is taken into account, hence where it is difficult to get more than 10 different leading bytes), one needs about 15 bytes of varying material. My `\\step` approach uses 20 (or 17, depending on whether you count the trailing `---`). My `\\dashes` approach may use various numbers depending on whether it is tailored to a specific number length.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about implementing arrays in TeX using control sequence names (csnames) is NOT correct?\n\nA) Using \\number to encode numeric array keys leads to poor hash performance due to limited hash value variation.\n\nB) Inserting dummy characters between digits in numeric keys, as in the \\step macro approach, helps spread out hash values and reduce collisions.\n\nC) The total length of the csname has a significant impact on hash performance, with longer names always resulting in slower lookups.\n\nD) When using \\number for encoding, the performance is inversely proportional to the length of the static prefix before the array access key.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is correct: The text explains that using \\number for 5-digit keys results in only 280 possible hash values, leading to many collisions.\n\nB is correct: The \\step macro inserts \"---\" between digits to spread out hash values, improving performance by reducing collisions.\n\nC is incorrect: The text states \"The total length of the cs name doesn't seem to be significant.\" This contradicts the statement in option C.\n\nD is correct: The text mentions that when using \\number, \"the overall performance of the array implementation is almost directly inversely proportional to the 'static' prefix in front of the array access key.\"\n\nThe correct answer is C because it contradicts the information provided in the text, while the other options are supported by the given information."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/30", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/147807", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/25449/"], "docs_id": 147807, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Occasionally we have employees supplied with company equipment that leave on less than favorable terms.

For 85% and more variance on your example, you would need to keep 7 principal components.\n\nConcerning the added plot, it might be more tricky to read it. In order to proceed as described in the previous paragraph, when you are given some percentage to keep, you would first integrate and then read off the value of needed components. Actually you have this information already, this is the very same \"Cumulative Proportion\" field. Just plot it and you will see.\n\nFinally about the (non)inclusion of class variable into the dataset to be analyzed with PCA. Your intent is to analyze the dataset given some measurements and not the class label. The class label is some additional information (typically posterior).

The main reason this capability isn't more widely used is due to security concerns. Accessing the NTFS Master File Table directly bypasses the file system's security infrastructure. This means only users with administrative privileges or \"Manage Volume\" rights can run such programs. \n\nMicrosoft and other large companies are unlikely to promote a product that requires users to run as administrators due to the security risks involved. While it's theoretically possible to create a system that filters out secured data in the background, implementing this securely and correctly would be extremely challenging and resource-intensive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the technology itself isn't new or underdeveloped.

It calculates the total quantity of items in the cart, checks if it's a multiple of 12 using the modulo operator (%), and if not, it adds an error message and redirects the user back to the cart. This exactly matches the specified requirement of allowing checkout only for quantities that are multiples of 12.\n\nOption A only checks if the quantity is less than 12, which doesn't fulfill the requirement for multiples of 12.\nOption C uses a built-in method to get the quantity, which is fine, but it also checks for quantities less than 12, which is not part of the requirement.\nOption D is the default Magento code for minimum order amount, which is unrelated to the specific requirement of multiples of 12."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/11/18", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/2937", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/722/"], "docs_id": 2937, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We recently purchased a house with a REALLY old dishwasher.

What I mean is\u2014SOFU were all successes in their own right. Are the new sites getting there as well on the community level? More specifically, do we have too many mods?\n\nCurrently, SE has [216 mods](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109875/full-list-of-moderators/109889#109889), and that number is growing. Since each site gets \\~3 new mods, and there's no site limit, that number is going to continue to grow and grow and grow. That's a lot of mods.\n\nStack Overflow currently has [10 moderators](https://stackoverflow.com/about) and is in the process of electing 4 more, for a total of 14 mods, all of whom together will handle:\n\n* 859k users\n* 2\\.7***m*** visits per day\n* 4k questions per day (not posts)\n* > 1k flags per day\n\nThe most successful sites, depending on various metrics, are Ask Ubuntu and Programmers. The latter is *special*, so we'll look at AU, which is a more typical SE site.\n\n* 26k users\n* 61k visits per day\n* 126 questions per day (not posts)\n\nMathematically, AU is about 3% of SO, yet has 21% the number of mods. If we were to look at this purely by the numbers, either AU only needs 1 mod or SO needs 100 mods. \n\n*I don't have AU flag data, but I can say EL\\&U would find even 30 flags a day to be high.*\n\nObviously, neither is true\u2014no site can survive on 1 mod simply because every individual mod will be away for various lengths of time (sleep, travel, etc.). With three mods, if one is away, the other two are there to deal with issues. As far as SO is concerned, it should be readily apparent that SO doesn't need 100 mods.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we need 216 mods for 71 sites. [We shouldn't even have 71 sites\u2014I've posted an answer below to explain why, but it's really a tangent.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111489/is-se-2-0-scaling-well/111490#111490) **I suppose the reason why I dislike having too many mods is that we're going to reach a point where every active SE user is a mod on some site, which means we're all policing each other.**\n\n*Proposal:* This isn't fully fleshed out, but why not (from here on out) elect cross\\-site mods for the smaller SE 2\\.0 sites? Say 6 mods across 3 related sites\u2014the flag load can be easily handled, mods are on more (a single interface would be nice), mods would be more cognizant of the scope of related sites, and then we don't have this huge number of mods.\n\nI won't specify what a related site is, but Lit \\+ SFF come to mind as being sites that could use cross\\-mods, maybe even EL\\&U \\+ Writers. Programmers and Gardening obviously aren't related.\n\nOr is having this many mods not a problem? Or are the logistics going to be a problem (sites don't graduate at the same time)? Or anything else?\n\n*N.B.* I don't think it's really relevant, but I suppose I should insert a disclaimer that I'm a mod for EL\\&U.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The idea that three to five people per site moderating is too much is patently absurd.\n\nOn the most popular sites\u2014Ask Ubuntu, Gaming, Apple, Android, and Programmers\u2014moderators account for less than a few hundredths of a percent of the total user base. On a site like Programmers, 45 times more new avid users (200\\+ rep) then there are active moderators are added every two weeks. Even on our least performing sites (e.g. Literature), regular users outnumber moderators 197 to 1\\.\n\nA site like Programmers also generates 1,000 flags a month: about 10 flags a day for each active moderator. Combined with staying active on the site's meta, TL, and here, there's a lot of time spent per day for something that's entirely volunteer. Throw in the massive amount of effort by Stack Exchange to streamline and improve moderator tools for Stack Overflow and the other Stack Exchange sites because [the moderator load has been *too high*](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101431/should-stack-overflow-moderators-have-a-standard-of-duty), and the conclusion one ought to reach is that we need *more* moderators, not less.\n\nAnd beyond that, each moderator is expected to be completely versed in their own site's activity and policies and be *trusted* members of the community: we're entrusted to act with a large amount autonomy and privileges because of that.\n\nYou say the solution is to start combining moderators: beyond the work each moderator does on their own site, they need to do it on other sites where they aren't trusted or possibly even active. How do you expect that to go? Everyone gets double the work and half the trust they have now, for what? Because you think 200 moderators sounds like a lot of people?\n\nThe overhead for having a few moderators per site is offset many times over by how it makes it so much easier for everyone that there are people willing to take the time to get heavily invested in a specific community to help guide and moderate it. I don't know why you'd want to look a gift horse in the mouth like that.\n\nAs to the suggestion that there are too many sites: on what basis? Have you *been* to Area 51 or *any* of the other sites? Each site was created because there was enough critical mass to create a specific audience about a topic. Most sites have been able to get traction precisely *because* the experts for those sites would not or could not contribute to a more general site. Most sites on the network are active and have found successful niches that are working for them with hundreds of questions and thousands of users.\n\nConsider the person who looks at the price of an economy car and sees $9,000\\. He says, \"Whoa, that's a lot of money! Why does it cost so much? I don't want to spend that much.\" Costs so much compared to what? Other new cars? No, that's on the low end. Other modes of transportation? Sure, but you don't get the benefits of the car. You want to pay less, you don't get the car.\n\nIn the same vein, 200 moderators and 70 sites sounds like a lot when they're taken completely out of context. But if you look at what's been built over the past 2 years, it's a small price to pay for what we've gotten. You don't want this many sites and this many moderators? You clearly don't want what makes Stack Exchange Stack Exchange: a network of niche sites full of topic\\-specific experts."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information given about Stack Exchange moderation, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Stack Exchange has too many moderators, and the number should be reduced by combining moderation duties across related sites.\n\nB) The current number of moderators is appropriate given the workload and need for site-specific expertise.\n\nC) Stack Exchange needs significantly more moderators, as the current number is insufficient to handle the workload.\n\nD) The number of moderators should be directly proportional to the number of users on each site.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

They take up space in your instruction encoding. If you had 256 registers, for instance, you'd need to use 8 bits in an instruction just to specify a single register. This could increase the overall size of instructions, or limit the types of instructions that can be encoded; having fewer registers, generally speaking, makes your instruction encoding denser.\n2. From a practical standpoint, there's a limit to how many registers are useful for applications, and 32 is at the upper end of that; few applications end up ever using all of the registers! 16 (as seen on ARM, among others) is generally sufficient, and some architectures get away with even fewer (like 32\\-bit x86, which has only 8\\).\n3. They take up physical space on the CPU. There might be better things you could use that for, like more cache, or more execution units.\n\nThat all being said, modern CPUs often have tons of registers. For instance, an Intel Haswell CPU has 168 integer registers!

Modern CPUs use additional physical registers for register renaming, which is crucial for supporting out-of-order and speculative execution techniques. This allows the CPU to optimize performance without changing the visible architecture to software.\nD) is incorrect because while compatibility with legacy instruction sets is important, it's not the main reason for having extra physical registers.\n\nThis question tests understanding of advanced CPU architecture concepts, particularly the difference between architectural registers (those exposed in the ISA) and the actual physical registers in modern processors, as well as their purpose in improving performance."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/09/30", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/63767", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/18625/"], "docs_id": 63767, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How to restart window manager so that styles (or whatever) are restored?\n\nAfter doing `/etc/init.d/networking stop` they feel completely broken.\n\nI have reinstalled lightdm.\nI have restarted lightdm.\nNothing seems to help.\n\nIs there a command line tool to reconfigure lightdm with?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You may need to restart your display manager to fix your problem. \n\n11\\.04 and earlier.\n-------------------\n\n```\nsudo service gdm restart\n\n```\n\nUbuntu 11\\.10 and newer.\n------------------------\n\n```\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n```\n\n`lightdm` replaces `gdm` in Ubuntu 11\\.10\n\nUbuntu 15\\.04 and newer.\n------------------------\n\n```\nsudo service sddm restart\n\n```\n\nWhile restarting lightdm restarts the entire display manager, you may be able to resolve the issue by restarting unity or compiz (Unity is a compiz plugin).\n\nRestarting Unity (`nohup setsid unity` OR `nohup unity --restart` on the CLI OR `Alt`\\+`F2` and type `unity`) restarts the Unity shell. \n\nIf that doesn't work, restart compiz with `nohup compiz --replace`.
