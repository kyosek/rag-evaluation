What's behind this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On one hand it improves safety very marginally... on the other hand it escalates time and cost. Simple as that. In marginal\\-benefit cases like this, every country makes that call in their own way.\n\nThe builders have a very strong lobby within NFPA, which is why improvements are highly valued which let the builder work faster, like backstabs, wire nuts or plug\\-on\\-neutral breakers. A proposal to amend NEC to require the sleeves would need to be supported by a body of evidence documenting fires which the bare grounds have started. Since NFPA is, after all, the National *Fire Protection* Association\\* and gets fire reports from most fire chiefs, they have that data.\n\nNote also that the UK line\\-ground voltage is twice North American voltage, since we actually do the center\\-grounding that the UK only does on construction sites. As such, open\\-air arcing between a live terminal and a nearby bare ground may be more of a risk in the 5\\-continent system.\n\n\\* Weirdly you'd expect them to be the National *Fire Prevention* Association.

The documentation mentions several key points:\n\n1. The UK has a higher line-ground voltage (twice that of North America), which could increase the risk of open-air arcing.\n2. The NFPA in the USA would require evidence of fires caused by bare grounds to change regulations, suggesting a data-driven approach.\n3. The builders' lobby in the USA influences decisions, favoring faster work methods.\n4. Cost and time considerations play a role in deciding whether to implement marginal safety improvements.\n\nWhile answers A, B, and C each contain partial truths, they don't capture the full complexity of the situation.

But when I do this, no packet can go through the rule `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` in the ipv6 table. All of them are dropped because of INPUT chain policy (`DROP`).\n\n```\n# ip6tables -nvL\nChain INPUT (policy DROP 5 packets, 360 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n    0     0 ACCEPT     all      eth0   *       ::/0                 ::/0                 ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\n    0     0 ACCEPT     all      lo     *       ::/0                 ::/0\n    0     0 ACCEPT     all      tun0   *       ::/0                 ::/0                 ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\n    0     0 DROP       all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 ctstate INVALID\n    0     0 UDP        udp      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 ctstate NEW\n    0     0 TCP        tcp      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 tcp flags:0x17/0x02 ctstate NEW\n    0     0 REJECT     tcp      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 reject-with tcp-reset\n    0     0 REJECT     udp      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 reject-with icmp6-port-unreachable\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n    0     0 DROP       all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 ctstate INVALID\n\nChain TCP (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n\nChain UDP (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n\n```\n\nAs you can see there's no output packets, so why google and stack exchange try to connect to my machine? And how do they do it because even I can't ping my ipv6 address?\n\nThey also say if my ISP doesn't have ipv6 (in the lease, there's no ipv6 entry) I should disable ipv6 and had done this before by using `ipv6.disable=1`. I asked similar question at `meta.stackoverflow.com`, and I got an answer that I shouldn't disable ipv6\\.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I have some connection problems, I mean sometimes I can't access pages at stack exchange, or google, I have also problems with pastebin.com. In each case there are the same symptoms \\-\\- after typing an address in my browser, I have to wait sometimes several minutes in order to access the site and after reloading it 2\\-3 times, I can browse it freely, at least for a certain period of time. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your IPv6 address starts with `fe80:` and is therefore a link\\-local address. Such addresses are only usable on the same link as the network interface. Because the same link\\-local subnet exists on every network interface you'll have to specify *which* interface you want to use. For example when you want to ping a link\\-local address.\n\nTry one of the following `ping6` examples. Both do the same:\n\n```\nping6 fe80::2e0:4cff:fe75:309%eth0\nping6 -I eth0 fe80::2e0:4cff:fe75:309\n\n```\n\nThis also means that only systems on your local link (your LAN) can use this link\\-local address to connect to your system. Routers won't route those addresses. There is no way that Google or Stack Exchange are sending IPv6 traffic to your machine, because your machine does not have an IPv6 address that is reachable/routable from them.\n\nSo, what IPv6 traffic *are* you seeing on your interface? Probably things like mDNS ([multicast DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)) and other protocols that can automatically connect on the local link. For example [Apple Airplay](http://www.apple.com/airplay/) and [Windows Home Group](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/products/features/homegroup).\n\nYour firewall rules are missing a very important thing: `ICMPv6`. IPv6 uses ICMP a lot more than IPv4, and not letting ICMP packets in can severely cripple your traffic because you won't receive error messages related to that traffic. This can cause long delays/timeouts. Allowing ICMPv6 traffic in usually doesn't hurt, so you can add this to your firewall rules:\n\n```\nip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -j ACCEPT\n\n```\n\nIf you want to block `ping6` packets (although I don't really understand why people still do that these days, it makes debugging connectivity a lot harder) you can add this like before the previous `ACCEPT` line:\n\n```\nip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 128 -j DROP\n\n```\n\nThis is mostly important when you get real global IPv6 connectivity to your machine, but it won't hurt if you already prepare for that :\\-)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting IPv6 connectivity issues on a Linux machine.

If your present data falls into it than conclude that the present day\u2019s sales is not significantly different. Otherwise it is significantly different. This is a simple way.

If you aren't lucky, some incompatible change will have happened on both sides of the partition and you'll be days cleaning up the mess.\n\nI suspect that if you need the minority portions of a cluster to operate independently, then you either need a solution different than Zookeeper, OR perhaps you don't actually want a cluster at all, perhaps you want a bunch of systems that replicate back and forth somehow and just sync data whenever they can."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a distributed system using a consensus algorithm like ZooKeeper or Paxos, why is it generally not recommended to run with only two members, and what potential issue arises if the majority constraint is relaxed to allow operation with exactly 50% of members?\n\nA) Running with two members reduces system availability compared to a single member setup.\nB) Relaxing the majority constraint to 50% with the eldest member as tie-breaker would solve all partition scenarios.\nC) Having two members increases the risk of data inconsistency in case of network partitions.\nD) The system becomes more fault-tolerant with two members compared to three or more members.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while it's true that running with two members can reduce availability in certain scenarios, this isn't the main reason it's not recommended.\n\nB is incorrect because relaxing the majority constraint, even with an eldest member tie-breaker, doesn't solve all partition scenarios and can lead to more complex issues when reconnecting partitioned clusters.\n\nC is correct. With only two members, any network partition or node failure results in two minority clusters. If both were allowed to operate independently, it could lead to divergent states and data inconsistencies. This is the core reason why consensus algorithms typically require a majority to continue operation.\n\nD is incorrect because two members actually make the system less fault-tolerant compared to configurations with three or more members.\n\nThe key insight is that consensus algorithms like those used in ZooKeeper are designed to maintain consistency and provide clear rules for recovery after partitions heal.

You either define a `foo_port_t` type in the policy, allow you4 app access to it, like this:\n\n```\nallow foo_t foo_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;\n\n```\n\nand the use something like this to label the actual port\n\n```\nsemanage port -a -t foo_port_t -p tcp 803\n\n```\n\nThis will claim TCP port 803 for your application. Most ports below 1023 already have labels on them though and you cannot label a port, file, whatever multiple times.\n\nSo option two: you can allow your app to bind to a port that has a different label, by putting lines like this into your policy module:\n\n```\nrequire { \n    type http_port_t;\n}\n\nallow foo_t http_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;\n\n```\n\nThis would allow you app to bind to any port that has `http_port_t` (meaning 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009 and 8443\\). You can find what label the port (803 in this example) you want to use, has by this command:\n\n```\nsemanage port -l | grep 803\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided SELinux documentation:\n\nQuestion: In SELinux, you want to allow your custom application \"myapp\" to bind to port 800, which is below 1024.

Here's why:\n\n1. Port 800 is likely already labeled as reserved_port_t, as it's below 1024.\n2. We don't need to add a new port label; we just need to allow our app to bind to the existing label.\n3. The `require` statement ensures the necessary type is available in the policy.\n4. The `allow` statement grants the necessary permission for myapp_t to bind to reserved_port_t.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it attempts to create a new port type, which isn't necessary and may conflict with existing labels for ports below 1024.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it unnecessarily tries to relabel port 800 as http_port_t, which could disrupt other services and is not the correct label for this port.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it attempts to modify the port label first, which isn't necessary, and then allows binding to http_port_t, which isn't the correct type for port 800."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89518", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/12489/"], "docs_id": 89518, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The proof that $\\\\Gamma(z)\\\\pm \\\\Gamma(1\\-z)$ only has zeros for $z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ or $z\\= \\\\frac12 \\+i \\\\mathbb{R}$ has been given here:\n\n[Are all zeros of $\\\\Gamma(s) \\\\pm \\\\Gamma(1\\-s)$ on a line with real part \\= $\\\\frac12$ ?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89324/are-all-zeros-of-gammas-pm-gamma1-s-on-a-line-with-real-part-frac12)\n\nAn obvious follow up question is whether $\\\\zeta(s) \\\\pm \\\\zeta(1\\-s)$ also has zeros (other than its non\\-trivial ones that would induce 0\\+0 or 0\\-0\\). \n\nThis is indeed the case and $\\\\zeta(s)^2 \\- \\\\zeta(1\\-s)^2$ has the following zeros:\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 0\\.819545329 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 3\\.436218226 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 9\\.666908056 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 14\\.13472514 i$ (the first non trivial)\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 14\\.51791963 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 17\\.84559954 i$\n\n$\\\\dots$\n\nThese 'semi' trivial zeros appear to all lie on the critical line.

This implies that $\\\\operatorname{Gal}(K\\_{n\\\\ell}/K\\_{n})$ is very closely related to $Z\\_{n}/Z\\_{n\\\\ell}$ (in general, there might be a small kernel to the surjective map $Z\\_{n}/Z\\_{n\\\\ell}\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{Gal}(K\\_{n\\\\ell}/K\\_{n})$ corresponding to units in $\\\\mathcal O\\_{K}$) so it remains to describe the quotient $Z\\_{n}/Z\\_{n\\\\ell}$.\n\nThe payoff of having worked adelically is now that you can analyze this quotient place by place and locally at all places except $\\\\ell$, it will be trivial by construction. At $\\\\ell$, you are considering the quotient of the multiplicative group of an order in a quadratic unramified extension $E$ of $\\\\mathbb Q\\_{\\\\ell}$ by the multiplicative group of a maximal order. Because $E$ embeds in $M\\_2(\\\\mathbb Q\\_{\\\\ell})$, you can realize these multiplicative subgroups of orders as compact subgroups of $\\\\operatorname{GL}\\_{2}(\\\\mathbb Q\\_{\\\\ell})$.\n\nNow I think I have done as much as I could without explicitly calculating, so the remaining part has to involve a calculation, which amounts to the fact that conjugating \n$$\\\\begin{pmatrix}a\\&b\\\\\\\\c\\&d\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\textrm{ by }g\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\ell\\&0\\\\\\\\0\\&1\\\\end{pmatrix}$$\nyields\n$$\\\\begin{pmatrix}a\\&b/\\\\ell\\\\\\\\c\\\\ell\\&d\\\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nIt follows that the subgroups $Z\\_{?}$ localized at $\\\\ell$ can respectively be identified with the unit group of a maximal order $R$ in $M\\_{2}(\\\\mathbb Q\\_{\\\\ell})$ (which can be taken to be $M\\_2(\\\\mathbb Z\\_{\\\\ell})$) and the unit group of the order $R\\\\cap g^{\\-1}Rg$. You should already recognize these as the groups appearing in the definition of the Hecke operator $T(\\\\ell)$ defined adelically but to be complete, we finally find that $Z\\_{n}/Z\\_{n\\\\ell}$ is \n$$\\\\frac{(\\\\mathcal O\\_K/\\\\ell\\\\mathcal O\\_K)^\\\\times}{(\\\\mathbb Z/\\\\ell\\\\mathbb Z)^{\\\\times}}$$\nand so is $\\\\mathrm{Gal}(K\\_{nl}/K\\_n)$ (up to a small group of units in general). In particular, the orbit of $x\\_{n\\\\ell}$ under this Galois group is of cardinal $(\\\\ell^2\\-1\\)/(\\\\ell\\-1\\)\\=\\\\ell\\+1$. The formal sum of points in this orbit is included in the divisor equal to $T(\\\\ell)\\\\cdot x\\_n$ by definition of $T(\\\\ell)$ (a Hecke operator is the sum over all points on some modular curve mapping to a point on a modular curve below it and all points in the orbit do so) and the cardinality of the orbit and of the set of points in the definition of the Hecke operator are the same so these sets are equal. \n\nThe moral of this story is that quotient of multiplicative group of orders in quadratic unramified extensions of local fields, which describe Galois groups of extensions between ring\\-class fields, can be described in terms of quotients of multiplicative group of orders by their conjugates in $M\\_2(E)$, and so are closely linked to Hecke operators. Note also that if what I have written above is correct, and I think it is, then the equality you wanted to understand might not be actually strictly true for all the $\\\\ell$ you considered (because units in $\\\\mathcal O\\_K$ might introduce a slight discrepancy between the orbit under the Galois group and the formal sum defining the Hecke operator for some small $\\\\ell$).

Let l be a rational prime not dividing ND or n, and assume l is inert in the imaginary quadratic field K/Q. Which of the following statements about the relationship between the Galois action and the Hecke operator T_l on x_n is correct?\n\nA) The trace of x_nl from K_nl to K_n is always exactly equal to T_l x_n, regardless of the discriminant D of K.\n\nB) The trace of x_nl from K_nl to K_n is equal to T_l x_n only when D < -4, ensuring that the unit group of O_K is {\u00b11}.\n\nC) The Galois group Gal(K_nl/K_n) is isomorphic to (O_K/lO_K)^\u00d7 / (Z/lZ)^\u00d7, which always has order l+1.\n\nD) The equality between the trace of x_nl and T_l x_n holds because the Galois action on CM points is described by the norm of ideals in O_nl, while the Hecke operator is defined using sublattices of O_n.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The equality between the trace of x_nl from K_nl to K_n and T_l x_n generally holds, but there's a subtle condition on the discriminant D of the imaginary quadratic field K. When D < -4, we ensure that the unit group of O_K is {\u00b11}, which eliminates potential discrepancies caused by additional units in O_K.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the potential discrepancies caused by units in O_K for small discriminants (specifically D = -3 or -4).\n\nAnswer C is partially correct in describing the Galois group, but it doesn't address the main question about the relationship between the Galois action and the Hecke operator.\n\nAnswer D provides an oversimplified explanation that doesn't capture the subtle relationship between the Galois action and the Hecke operator, which is actually described through adelic methods and the fundamental theorem of complex multiplication.\n\nThe key insight is that the Galois action on CM points is described adelically, and the identification of terms in the trace and Hecke operator involves analyzing the quotient of multiplicative groups of orders in quadratic unramified extensions of local fields. This analysis reveals the close connection between Galois groups of ring class field extensions and Hecke operators, but also highlights the potential for small discrepancies due to units in O_K, which is why the condition D < -4 is necessary for the exact equality to hold."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/15", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20833", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3144/"], "docs_id": 20833, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a problem with this code :\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{decorations.markings}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings, mark = at position .5 with\n {\\draw (-2pt,-2pt) -- (2pt,2pt)  (2pt,-2pt) -- (-2pt,2pt);}}]    \n\n% wrong \n%\\draw [postaction={decorate}] (0,0) -- ++(146:1) arc (146:157:1)--(0,0);\n%fine\n\\draw [postaction={decorate}] (0,0) -- ++(146:1.2) arc (146:157:1.2)--(0,0);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThe line after % wrong gives an error `dimension too large`.

In short, it *doesn't* just do `(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}` (How could it? Taking square roots isn't even possible *theoretically* let alone the issues of precision.) but does something more complicated that at some stage involves *dividing* by one of the components. You can test this by trying a simple:\n\n```\n\\pgfmathparse{veclen(0.00006,0.00006)}\n\n```\n\n(the number was chosen as that *happens* to be the number that TeX barfs on when trying Altermundus' example. Multiply by 10 and it all works again.)\n\nLooking at the implementation of `veclen` I noticed that it did some initial scaling to take into account large numbers. So I added some lines to test also for small numbers as well. And that appears to solve the problem.\n\n(Unfortunately, I couldn't get `\\pgfmathredeclarefunction` to work properly.

What is the difference between host name and subdomain?\n3. **What is the relation between host name and fully qualified domain name (FQDN)?**\n4. **What is the \u201cwww\u201d in URL of some web sites?** As you know Google\u2019s web address is `www.google.com` but we have many web sites without \u201cwww\u201d for example: `superuser.com` and `en.wikipedia.org`. I read in this [article](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/question180.htm) that \u201cwww\u201d is just a declarative thing not more and is not related to the concept of hostname. Do you verify that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best way to explain the differences between these different items\u2014that are related but different\u2014is to break it down by example. Think of networks like a tree:\n\n* There is a trunk that separates into major branches.\n* Branches which in turn separate into smaller branches.\n* Smaller branches eventually leading to individual leaves.\n\nThe \u201ctrunk\u201d and \u201cbranches\u201d are \u201cdomains\u201d and \u201csubdomains\u201d and the leaves are individual devices, like computers. So let\u2019s start there.\n\n* **A \u201ccomputer name\u201d is strictly a local convention:** I have a computer named `giacomo1968`. This computer name is simply the name I have assigned my local machine. Nobody outside of my LAN will know this computer name; this is strictly a local setting.\n* **A \u201chostname\u201d (aka \u201cnodename\u201d) is a network identifier:** If I wanted to publicly advertise my local computer to others, I would have to attach a \u201chostname\u201d to the IP address of my computer. The \u201chostname\u201d doesn\u2019t really have to have anything to do with the computer name, but many times administrators like to use the same name to make things easier to understand. Also a \u201chostname\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean the computer is exposed to the Internet; it\u2019s just an easy way to let others on your network where/what your computer is. As [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname); emphasis is mine:\n\n> In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is **a\n> label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network** and\n> that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic\n> communication such as the World Wide Web, e\\-mail or Usenet.\n\n* **A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is just that; a fully qualified domain name:** Now that might seem confusing but you need to think of it this way: It just means in the great scheme of things, what is the actual \u201cpath\u201d to get to a computer. So let\u2019s say I have my computer named `giacomo1968` and it has a hostname on my LAN that is `giacomo1968`. Within the context of my LAN, that\u00a0`giacomo1968` is my computer name, and is my \u201chostname\u201d and can *possibly* be considered my \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d depending on my LAN architecture. Meaning let\u2019s say my office LAN has other nodes in it like, `first_floor` and `second_floor` and my \u201chostname\u201d of `giacomo1968` is on the `second_floor` network. Well, if that were the case, then my LAN\\-based \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d would be `giacomo1968.second_floor` and that is it. But let\u2019s say I worked at a big company named \u201cbig\\_company.com\u201d and my computer were somehow exposed to the world. Then in that case, my WAN\\-based \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d could be `giacomo1968.second_floor.big_company.com` or maybe even just `giacomo1968.big_company.com` if the network administrator didn\u2019t want to be hassled with the \u201csecond\\_floor\u201d designation. Again, as [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name); emphasis is mine:\n\n> A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an\n> absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact\n> location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It\n> specifies all domain levels, including the top\\-level domain and the\n> root zone. **A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack\n> of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.**\n\n* **The \u201cwww\u201d in some website names is a \u201chostname\u201d designation that is historical in nature:** Basically, back in the 1990s when the world wide web was still in it\u2019s infancy, networks had many different services attached to them. And mainly in an academic context. So there would be a place like `whattsamattau.edu` and that school would have FTP services on `ftp.whattsamattau.edu`, email on `mail.whattsamattau.edu` and so on\u2026 So when the world wide web came along, they would just have placed the web server on `www.whattsamattau.edu`. Nowadays, everyone\u2014and seemingly everything in the world\u2014has a website. And many people just register domains just for the web service. So the historic convention of `www` is discarded in many cases. Many people have websites without `www` but will still have accommodations to redirect `www` traffic to the main, non\\-`www` hostname. But technically speaking, `www` can still be considered a hostname.\n* **BONUS (Never Asked But Mentioned/Implied): What is a \u201csubdomain\u201d in the great scheme of things:** A subdomain is basically just a child of a parent domain/hostname. So in my example of `giacomo1968.big_company.com` the `giacomo1968` can be considered a subdomain of `big_company.com` and `big_company` in that can be considered to be the \u201cdomain\u201d with `.com` being the top\\-level domain (TLD). Yet again, [as Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System); emphasis is mine:\n\n> In the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy, **a subdomain is a domain\n> that is part of a larger domain.**\n\nNow after drafting all of this, it can be confusing. Many computer names are hostnames are fully\\-qualified domain names and in some cases they could be subdomains. It\u2019s all a matter of context. And looking at articles online the words \u201cdomain,\u201d \u201chost\u201d and \u201cnode\u201d are used fairly loose and fast all over the place. So in my opinion, many uses of these terms are synonymous.\n\nWhich also helps to explain your confusion in item number 2:\n\n> If \u201cmail\u201d in `mail.google.com` and \u201cdevelopers\u201d in\n> `developers.google.com` are called subdomains why is `en` in\n> `en.wikipedia.org` called hostname? What is the difference\n> between host name and subdomain?\n\nThe `en.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain *and* a hostname. The `en` in the `en.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain of the domain name `wikipedia.org`. And `en.wikipedia.org` is in itself a hostname since `en.wikipedia.org` has an IP address connected to it and thus a computer connected to that IP address as well. Meaning the `en` itself is semantically considered a subdomain, but it is also a hostname because there is a host (computer) connected to the IP address connected to `en.wikipedia.org`. So knowing that `mail.google.com` and `developers.google.com` are hostnames as well which are both subdomains of `google.com`.\n\nTo possibly make things clearer think of it like this; let\u2019s use the non\\-existant subdomain `fakename.wikipedia.org` as an example:\n\n* The `org` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a [top\\-level domain (TLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). As a top\\-level domain it does not resolve to an IP address. Thus it is not a hostname. It is simply a naming convention.\n* The `wikipedia.org` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) and it has the *potential* to be a hostname as well if it is connected to an IP address and resolves to a computer when one goes to `wikipedia.org`.\n* The `fakename` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain name since it is a child domain of `wikipedia.org` in the context of the domain name itself. It can be a hostname if it connected to an IP address and resolves to a computer when one goes to `fakename.wikipedia.org`.\n\nIf you ping `fakename.wikipedia.org` you are attempting to ping the `fakename` subdomain of `wikipedia.org`. If that ping dies \u2014 which it most likely will since it is fake \u2014 that means that the host is down or it does not exist. If it dies with an IP address connected to it, that would mean the hostname `fakename.wikipedia.org` is down. If the ping dies with 100% no IP address connected to it, them it would mean that the subdomain `fakename.wikipedia.org` is an invalid hostname.\n\nYes, this can all be confusing. But what it boils down to is the difference between what a domain/subdomain is in the context of DNS entries versus what domain/subdomain is in the context of having a host/computer connected to it.\n\nSo if this all started with your curiosity about `www`, that is a historic hostname/nodename/subdomain that is not really used as a convention as much anymore but is still so commonly used that many sites have some accommodations in place to \u201ccatch\u201d requests to `www` and redirect them to the main hostname of a website."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company has a web server with the computer name \"WebServer1\" on their local network.

Unlike an alternator, regulation is done by measuring the output voltage and then shorting the stator coil to ground with SCRs. \n\nHow does the system convert rectified AC pulses to DC? It treats the battery as a capacitor.

Upgrading the entire electrical system is necessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that the failing battery is likely the root cause of both issues. In ATVs, the battery acts as a capacitor to smooth out voltage from the simple stator generator system. When the battery fails, it can't properly filter voltage pulses and noise, leading to poor regulation and potential overvoltages that can damage LED lights. Replacing the battery should be the first step in resolving both the LED failures and the charging issues.

Option C directly modifies core files, which is strongly discouraged in Magento 2 development. Option D, creating a completely new widget, is often unnecessary and may lead to compatibility issues with other parts of the system that expect the original widget to be present.\n\nTo implement the mixin, you would create a requirejs-config.js file in your module with the appropriate mixins configuration, and then create your custom JavaScript file that extends the original functionality."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/24", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/23049", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/9814/"], "docs_id": 23049, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been playing this game for a few hours now and I got to the point where I need to find a place of power.

The priority option is the first way the routing table is chosen. A rule with a lower `priority` value will be used before a higher one. Calling `ip rule show` you will see the rules printed with their priority on the left side.\n\n```\n[priority]:    [rule]\n\n```\n\nFor the sake of completeness, a quote from `man ip-rule`:\n\n> priority PREFERENCE\n> \n> \n> the priority of this rule. PREFERENCE is an unsigned integer value, higher number means lower priority, and rules get processed in order of increasing number. **Each rule should have an explicitly set unique priority value.** The options preference and order are synonyms with priority.\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nSo first and foremost, it's best to use a unique priority for each rule, then there can be no ambiguity. In the case of rules with the same priority, they will be evaluated in the order they were added. If rules are mutually exclusive this isn't much of a risk (such as two rules that match on different source IPs from other hosts). If your rules are automatically added, that probably means the rule file that is alphabetically first will be used, which isn't a great way to determine routing.\n\nHow I reached the conclusion that first added rules are used:\n\n1. Created VM (vm1\\) with two interfaces on the same network (192\\.168\\.0\\.1/24 and 192\\.168\\.0\\.2/24\\).\n2. Created another VM (vm2\\) on the network (192\\.168\\.0\\.3/24\\)\n3. Created two routing tables, `table1` and `table2` on vm1\n\n`ip route add default dev eth0 table table1`\n\n`ip route add default dev eth1 table table2`\n\n4. Created two rules with different priorities\n\n`ip rule add to 192.168.0.3 table table1 priority 10`\n\n`ip rule add to 192.168.0.3 table table2 priority 11`\n\n5. ping vm2 from vm1\n6. `tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.0.3` shows the ping\n7. `tcpdump -i eth1 host 192.168.0.3` does not\n\nThis is the expected behavior of `priority`\n\n8. Re\\-add the table2 rule with priority 10, ping still only appears on `eth0`. `ip rule show` lists `table1` rule before `table2` rule.\n9. Delete table1 rule, ping appears on eth1\\.\n10.

But I don't know where to start. I am familier with `Core Java` and mainly, I want to learn `JPA` and basics of `Hibernate` and `Spring Framework`. The main reason for this is I am working on a project which is using all these things. And most of the code is being developed by some senior guys and I have to make some modifications in that.

Any reference material, like links, books?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whenever I want to learn a new framework/language, I usually whip up a small project that uses it. For a web framework, I have a common webapp that I write using it. It's simple and doesn't do much, but it has enough features that I need to take advantage of the more common parts of the framework (database, background jobs, mvc or whatever similar such). In fact, not long ago I took up the task of learning Spring/MVC\\+Hibernate. I don't know it all, certainly, but it gave me enough of a background that, when I don't know something, I know what questions to ask and how to ask them to get more information.\n\nFor web frameworks, I usually start with the simple \"hello world\" example provided for most frameworks. If it has a \"guestbook\" example (ie, to show database use), I follow up with that. From there, I just start adding the functionality I want in my learning application, beginning with the simplest. The idea being that I can figure out how to ask the right questions for the simple things. After I've done some simple things, I can then look at the more complex things and, with the information I've already learned, I can hopefully formulate the right questions to ask for them.\n\nI recently started putting the [code for such learning projects on sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rhs-galleries/), if you're interested.\n\n*Edit: Donal's comment made we want to add...

From there, the recommended approach is to gradually add functionality to a small learning project, starting with the simplest features and working up to more complex ones.

The documentation emphasizes that when flagging a post as VLQ, it's as if you're saying, \"This content should not exist. Delete it. Now.

The VLQ flag is not the appropriate tool for this situation.\n\nOption C is correct as it aligns with the intended use of the VLQ flag as described in the documentation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because posts with bad punctuation or grammar can typically be improved through editing, making them unsuitable for the VLQ flag.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the VLQ flag should be reserved for content that is beyond salvation and requires immediate deletion, not for posts that can be improved or addressed through other means."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/14", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/2642", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 2642, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am considering to appear for [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre/).

If you don't have at least 3 months to read that book (still about 60 a day), shift to some other that feature less but more selected GRE vocabularies.\n\n**Focus on learning word roots.** Stay away from a long list of words in alphabetical order, instead, go for ones that display the meaning as well as the word roots (prefixes and suffixes) of the vocabularies. For example, *bene* is a prefix that means \"good\" and it forms words like *bene*/fit, *bene*/fiter, *bene*/ficial, *bene*/faction, *bene*/factor or *bene*/factress, *bene*/dict (blessed), *bene*/diction, *bene*/fice, and *bene*/volent, etc. That way, you can absorb many more words in one go.\n\n**Use flash cards.** Thousands of words are hard to review, you can either buy the ready\\-to\\-use GRE flash cards, or make your own. Keep the pile with you and review whenever and wherever possible.\n\n**Take a mock exam.** If you have not researched what taking GRE is like, I'd recommend trying a mock exam just to familiarize with the environment. You can check the GRE site to see if they have one available. Major tutoring companies may also be able to provide a few if you enroll in their prep courses.

If we apply PCA to the dataset, and compute the reconstruction error (in $\\\\ell^2$\\-norm) using the first $d \\\\leq N$ components, will the reconstruction error monotonically decrease to $0$ as $d \\\\rightarrow N$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, review the connections between PCA and SVD. See: [Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134282/relationship-between-svd-and-pca-how-to-use-svd-to-perform-pca) We consider a matrix $A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times n}$ for $m \\\\ge n$ which is appropriately centered and scaled so that applying SVD to $A$ has the essential and direct relationship to PCA as described in the other thread.\n\nSecond, we need to review the [Eckart\u2013Young\u2013Mirsky theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation#Proof_of_Eckart%E2%80%93Young%E2%80%93Mirsky_theorem_(for_spectral_norm)). This theorem provides that for the spectral norm $\\\\\\|\\\\cdot \\\\\\|\\_2$, the best rank\\-$d$ approximation to a matrix $A$ (or indeed a more general set of rectangular, real\\-valued matrices) is given by\n$$\nA\\_d \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^d \\\\sigma\\_iu\\_iv\\_i^\\\\top\n$$\nwhere $u\\_i,v\\_i$ are the $i$th columns of $U$ and $V$ in $A \\= USV^\\\\top$ the singular value decomposition of $A$. From the SVD, we can arrange the singular values in $S$ (and corresponding columns in $U$ and $V$) so that $\\\\sigma\\_1 \\\\ge \\\\sigma\\_2 \\\\ge \\\\sigma\\_3 \\\\ge \\\\cdots \\\\ge \\\\sigma\\_n \\\\ge 0$.\n\nIn other words, the Eckart\u2013Young\u2013Mirsky theorem shows that\n\n> $A\\_d$ minimizes $$ \\\\\\| A \\- A\\_d \\\\\\|\\_2\n> $$ for all $A\\_d$ which have rank $d$.\n\nSo all that remains is to show that $\\\\\\| A \\- A\\_d \\\\\\|\\_2$ is non\\-increasing in $d$.\n\nThis is trivial because choosing $d$ determines how many singular values you'll retain and how many are zeroed out; changing $d$ is just changing how many singular values are included or excluded. Because we're always retaining the *largest* $\\\\sigma\\_i$, we know that reconstruction error must be non\\-increasing. Naturally when $d\\=n$, the reconstruction error is zero because all of the data is retained.\n\nThis intuition can be demonstrated directly from the definition of the spectral norm, which depends only on the largest singular value of the matrix:\n$$\\\\\\| A \\\\\\|\\_2 \\= \\\\max \\\\{\\\\sigma\\_1, \\\\sigma\\_2, \\\\dots \\\\sigma\\_n \\\\}.$$\nWe know that the largest singular value of $\\\\\\| A \\- A\\_d \\\\\\|\\_2$ does not increase as $d$ increases because singular values are non\\-increasing by construction.\n\nOr we can just crank through the algebra to show the same result.\n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\\\| A \\- A\\_d \\\\\\|\\_2 \n\\&\\= \\\\\\| USV^\\\\top \\- US\\_d V^\\\\top \\\\\\|\\_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\left\\\\\\| \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n \\\\sigma\\_iu\\_iv\\_i^\\\\top \\- \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^d \\\\sigma\\_iu\\_iv\\_i^\\\\top \\\\right\\\\\\|\\_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\left\\\\\\| \\\\sum\\_{i\\=d\\+1}^n \\\\sigma\\_iu\\_iv\\_i^\\\\top \\\\right\\\\\\|\\_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\max \\\\{ \\\\sigma\\_{d\\+1}, \\\\sigma\\_{d\\+2}, \\\\dots, \\\\sigma\\_{n}, 0 \\\\} \\\\\\\\\n \\&\\= \\\\sigma\\_{d\\+1} \\\\le \\\\sigma\\_d.\n\\\\end{align}$$\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIt is not true that increasing $d$ will always decrease the reconstruction error; in some cases the reconstruction error will remain the same. This happens when the additional $\\\\sigma\\_i$ are zero. This is due to the connection between SVD and the rank of a matrix: the rank $r$ of $A$ is the number of positive singular values, so if $d$ is chosen such that $d\\>r$, the reconstruction error of $\\\\\\|A \\- A\\_{d\\|d\\>r} \\\\\\|\\_2$ will be the same as $\\\\\\|A \\- A\\_r \\\\\\|\\_2$.\n\nHowever, we have proved that the reconstruction error *does not increase* as $d$ increases."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a dataset X \u2208 \u211d^(m\u00d7n) where m > n, and let \u03c3_1 \u2265 \u03c3_2 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03c3_n \u2265 0 be its singular values.

YouTube for example, uses a CDN.\n\nThe main advantage of a CDN is that you have a local Point of Presence for the majority of your internet users. If you notice that you're getting a lot of traffic from North America and England and Brazil, there's no way that all of them are getting an optimum experience, because if your servers are located in New Zealand, then they're all going to access at different speeds.\n\nBy putting your servers in the countries where you get the majority of your traffic from, and then directing the user to their closest server, you're eliminating a lot of potential bottlenecks.\n\nSimply having \"some dedicated servers only serving static content\" does not alleviate this issue, as all your servers are going to be in the same place. If you're going to spread your servers out around the world, then your two scenarios are the same.\n\nAll that said, I would never bother to build my own CDN unless I was someone the size of YouTube or Facebook. There are a few providers out there who already have a massive, robust network that you can use.

Anyway here is the kernel of the question:\n\nHow many classes representing an entity/resource or whatever you want to call it, should you have? Let's take it on the example of **User** object.\n\nOften I see you have `UserEntity` used on the repository level to map to DB entity (sometimes autogenerated by your ORM), that maps to service level `UserDTO`, which then maps to `User` object to be returned by the API or View layer. This also gets more complicated if you plug in different APIs where some people opt\\-in to convert to per API object so `CRMUser`, `ShopUser` and so on.\n\nAll of those have the same (or similar) fields and no functionality. For each mapping, you need a Converter class and depending on your religion Interface.\n\nSo it gets quite complex in the end.\n\nDo you have any opinions/guidelines to follow here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Getting the right level of abstraction is a classic \"Goldilocks\" scenario:\n\nIf you have too few abstractions, you risk eg leaking details of the ORM into other layers and of creating undesirable coupling between those layers.\n\nIf you have too many abstractions, you risk making the code unnecessarily complex: \"\\*A moment ago, I had an `XyzUser`, now it's a `YzxUser`! Why?!??\". Trying to follow the flow of overly abstracted code is really hard.\n\nSo you want *baby bear's* bowl of abstractions: not too few and not too many; just right.\n\nBut what is that \"just right\" level of abstraction? It's basically as few levels of abstraction as possible, without creating either undesirable coupling, or leaky abstractions in the process. There's no fixed number for this as it will vary from app to app. Instead, every time you feel the need to add a new level of abstraction, ask yourself if it's worth it. Will the benefits of decoupling outweigh the disadvantages of complexity? If you feel the answer is \"yes\", then add another level of abstraction and stop doing so the moment the answer is \"no\" and possibly even when it's \"maybe\". Though the latter reveals the subjectivity of this topic: some people prefer complexity over coupling and others prefer the opposite. So your answer each time will be subjective, but as long as you/ your team are consistent with this subjectivity, it doesn't really matter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In software design, when considering the appropriate number of abstraction layers for representing entities like a User object, which of the following approaches best aligns with the \"Goldilocks\" principle described in the documentation?\n\nA) Always use at least three layers of abstraction (e.g., UserEntity, UserDTO, User) to ensure complete separation of concerns.\n\nB) Minimize abstraction layers as much as possible, ideally using a single User class across all layers of the application.\n\nC) Add abstraction layers incrementally, evaluating the trade-offs between decoupling and complexity at each step, and stopping when the costs outweigh the benefits.\n\nD) Create separate User objects for each API or view (e.g., CRMUser, ShopUser) to maximize flexibility and customization.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The \"Goldilocks\" principle described in the documentation emphasizes finding the right balance of abstractions - not too few and not too many. Option C best reflects this approach by suggesting an incremental evaluation of each abstraction layer. This method allows developers to consider the benefits of decoupling against the drawbacks of increased complexity, stopping when the optimal balance is reached.

This works fine, it will start nicely when my computer switches on and it will even survive suspend to RAM.\n\nProblem is, imwheel often halts, when tv\\-browser.org pops up an automatic notification. I configured those notifications in KWin to always show on top and also enabled the focus steeling prevention. Also TVB is not the only program to kill imwheel.\n\nIf I haven't moved the mouse for a few seconds, imwheel will survive a TVB notification. If I'm actively using the mouse (scrolling/left\\-clicking/dragging) the moment, one of those popups appears, the extra\\-mappings of imwheel are defunct thereafter.\n\nI ran imwheel from the console: no errors get displayed. The process of imwheel is still hanging around, but doesn't do anything anymore. It happens about once every hour, so I pretty much cannot rely on the thumb button currently issuing the command, I programmed it to or issuing e.g. a back in Firefox per default\\-configuration bypassing imwheel.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Anybody else ever suffered this problem?\n2. How and where to get help on this complex scenario?\n3. Shall I report a bug against KWin? In launchpad or upstream at kde?\n4. Who is maintaining imwheel? There is only an outdated <http://imwheel.sf.net> from 2004\n5. Can you recommend a more up to date alternate software for mapping mouse\\-thumb\\-buttons to key\\-strokes in Kubuntu / KDE?\n\nThanks for your time and advice\n\nEDIT:\n\nFound more ways to kill imwheel almost reliably.\n\n* In Firefox, when I save a small download / an image to my harddrive there is an animation of the green arrow icon. If I click my thumb\\-button (supposed to close the current tab by Ctrl\\+W) within two seconds of that animation, the tab won't close and imwheel is defunct everywhere (also in other programs/windows)\n* After switching windows or desktops I have some fancy 3D effects enabled. If I'm too fast clicking one of the thumb\\-buttons right after such an animation, imwheel gets defunct to.\n\nAs a wild guess I'd say, imwheel somehow tries to deliver it's derived key\\-events that translated from the thumb\\-button\\-presses, to some graphic overlay, which is not a full fledged window itself and certainly not supposed to ever gain keyboard\\-focus.\n\nFinally I found \"imwheel \\-\\-kill\" to be way faster for reactivating it (instead of logging out and in again). I even mapped that to a global keyboard shortcut.\n\nEDIT2:\n\nDebug shows, imwheel is ungrabbing buttons 4 to 9 and then waits eternally, never grabbing them again. Only a restart with \\-k can bring it back.\n\nThe easiest scenario is to send a mapped thumb button to a configured window, which is in the background and does not have the focus. Debug output shows, imwheel testing against the window which has the focus, not respecting the mouse position over the other window. None of the ordinary rules apply to this window, but I made an exclude rule at the end of \\~/.imwheelrc like this:\n\n\".\\*\"\n@Priority\\=\\-1000\n@Exclude\n\nmatching every window.\n\nRemoving/commenting this final exclude rule solves my problem. imwheel won't crash anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When running imwheel from the commandline, use the options '\\-d \\-D' to see debugging information.\n\n1.

Over the years I have created 2 Apple IDs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Currently the 90 day restriction is only for automatic download of additional purchased content.\n\nThis also is a per device limitation and not something about the account being banned from working elsewhere. \n\nFor 90 days after you turn on the \"automatic download feature\", you can't switch another account to start automatic downloads on that one device. You can always trigger updates manually. As long as you disable automatic downloads on the second account (or both) you won't have any issues with your two ID on multiple device setup until you run into the 10 total device limit for a given Apple ID for store purchases."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user has two Apple IDs and wants to use both on their devices. Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of multiple Apple IDs?\n\nA) Once you switch to a second Apple ID, you cannot use the first ID again for 90 days on any device.\n\nB) The 90-day restriction applies only to automatic downloads of purchased content on a specific device.\n\nC) You can freely switch between Apple IDs without any restrictions as long as you have fewer than 10 devices.\n\nD) Using a second Apple ID permanently locks you out of your first ID for all purchases and downloads.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, the 90-day restriction only applies to automatic downloads of additional purchased content on a specific device. It does not prevent you from manually downloading content or using the account on other devices. The restriction is device-specific and does not ban the account from working elsewhere. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the 90-day restriction does not apply to general use of the Apple ID, only to automatic downloads on a specific device. \n\nOption C is partially true about the 10-device limit, but it's incorrect in stating there are no restrictions on switching between IDs. \n\nOption D is completely false, as using a second Apple ID does not lock you out of your first ID for purchases and downloads."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/16", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/133734", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 133734, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am translating from German to English. \nThe scenario is: A screen sharing session is schedule and is not yet started.

This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized EMR wave propagating from left to right (X axis). The electric field is in a vertical plane (Z axis) and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane (Y axis). The electric and magnetic fields in EMR waves are always in phase and at 90 degrees to each other.\n\nThis is one optical ray from the source,and the colored part is how the functions describing the strength of the electric and magnetic field change in space with a wave pattern.\n\nYou ask:\n\n> Does the wave amplitude represent how high the wave goes (to the ceiling)?\n\nNo, what are waving are the strengths of the E and B fields.\n\n> And howcome it looks like a sphere? Why is it shaped like that,\n\nA source of electromagnetic waves, like an antenna impose a pattern that releases in spherical optical rays the wave depicted above , because of the geometry and the nature of wave solutions to the elecromagnetic equations. As the other answer says, it is a three dimensional radiation and will be distributed radially , similar to a two dimensional source of a disturbance of the surface of a lake which is distributed circularly. \n\n> does the electric field vector play a role in this shape?\n\nYes, it is the electric and magnetic fields that vary in space as the wave propagates. \n\n[![emwav](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DR4bA.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DR4bA.gif)\n\n> [This 3D animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation#Properties) shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from left to right.

These fields are always in phase, meaning they reach their maximum and minimum values at the same points in space and time. This is clearly illustrated in the 3D animation provided in the documentation, which shows the electric and magnetic fields oscillating in sync as the wave propagates."}}
