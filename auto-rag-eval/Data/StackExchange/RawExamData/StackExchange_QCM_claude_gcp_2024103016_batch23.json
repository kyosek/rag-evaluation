It crumbled again, so I brought in a professional to do it a few years back. Once again, there are portions of the floor where the grout has crumbled and worn away.\n\nSince these repairs were done by different people with different materials over the years, I'm thinking that the problem is with the floor itself.

Semiconductors are used to make transistors and diodes. A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor, such as metallic copper, and an insulator, such as glass. In my textbook, they say that its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"dopants\") into the crystal structure. When two differently doped regions exist in the same crystal, a semiconductor junction is created.\n\nNow, the different materials created from \"doping\" are called \"p\" and \"n\" materials. But, why semiconductors? Can't we dope insulators and conductors to make a diode instead of a semiconductor? If not, Why? (I know this question is vague, but I just wanted to know if there is a **very special reason** we like semiconductors so much. It is fine if it involves complected math and physics)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The properties of semi\\-conductors arise from the structure of the energy levels that electrons can occupy in the material.\n\nPut simply, electron energy levels can be divided into lower energy valence band levels, where electrons are attached to a particular atom, and higher energy conduction band levels, where electrons can move throughout the material. Electrons in conduction band levels can carry charge throughout the material and so allow a current to flow if an electric field is applied to the material.\n\nIn a conductor the valence band levels merge into the conduction band levels, and there are always many electrons in the conduction band acting as charge carriers. In an insulator there is a big gap (the band gap) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, and there are very few electrons in the conduction band. Nothing is a perfect insulator, but it takes a very strong electric field to free electrons from atoms in an insulator.\n\nIn a semi\\-conductor, there is a smaller gap between top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The Fermi level, which is the maximum energy level of electrons averaged over time, lies in this band gap. However, at any time there are always a few electrons with energies above the Fermi level, so these can enter the conduction band and act as charge carriers. Doping the semi\\-conductor moves the Fermi level up or down in the band gap.\n\nDoping a conductor might increase its conductivity slightly, but the conductivity of conductors like metals is so high anyway that this would make little difference. Doping an insulator does not generally reduce the size of its wide band gap, so there are still few electrons in the conduction band, and a doped insulator is usually still an insulator (although there are some exceptions).\n\nThere is a more detailed explanation of how semi\\-conductors work in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why semiconductors are preferred over insulators or conductors for creating diodes and transistors?\n\nA) Semiconductors have a variable Fermi level that can be easily manipulated through doping, unlike insulators or conductors.\n\nB) The band gap in semiconductors is smaller than in insulators but larger than in conductors, allowing for controlled electron flow.\n\nC) Doping semiconductors creates a significant change in conductivity, whereas doping insulators or conductors has minimal effect on their electrical properties.\n\nD) Semiconductors naturally have more electrons in the conduction band compared to insulators, making them more suitable for electronic applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Semiconductors are preferred for creating diodes and transistors because doping them creates a significant change in their conductivity. This is due to their unique band structure:\n\n- Semiconductors have a small but distinct band gap between the valence and conduction bands.\n- Doping moves the Fermi level within this band gap, significantly altering the number of charge carriers.\n- In contrast, doping conductors has little effect because they already have many electrons in the conduction band.\n- Doping insulators usually doesn't reduce their large band gap enough to significantly increase conductivity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Fermi level can be manipulated in semiconductors, this isn't the primary reason for their preference.\n\nOption B describes a property of semiconductors but doesn't explain why this makes them preferable for diodes and transistors.\n\nOption D is incorrect because semiconductors don't naturally have more electrons in the conduction band than insulators; it's the ability to control this through doping that makes them useful."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/19", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/237082", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/93996/"], "docs_id": 237082, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a bunch of `tar` files in my machine which I want to transfer to an external hard drive (EHD); they where created preserving permissions (using the `-p` flag).

While the tar files themselves may have preserved permissions, using the -a flag ensures that these permissions are correctly transferred to the destination. More importantly, it sets up the transfer in a way that allows for efficient future syncing. The -a flag is equivalent to -rlptgoD, which preserves various file attributes and enables recursion. This means that in subsequent rsync operations, only the changes will be transferred, saving time and resources.

But the general rule is that equations that are positioned as regular 'objects' in the text are shown in small 'inline style', while equations that are put on their own lines are allowed to be shown in their full, expanded, glory. This is not a bug, but a feature, and indeed what you normally want!\n\nMost often, you don't put very complex formulae 'inline', so you might not notice the difference in formatting very often. For instance, it is not visible in the example below.\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyfyz.png)\n\nHowever, this (nonsensical) example shows the change\\-of\\-formatting in action:\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCjaX.png)\n\nSurely it wouldn't look good if the inlined sum was expanded! My point is that the default formatting is almost always what you want.\n\nStill, you can change it to some extent. If the formula is on its own line, then you can choose if you want the sum to have its limits above or to the right. Simply right\\-click any of the limits and choose \"Change limit positions\" (or whatever the menu item may be called in the English version of Microsoft Word). However, if the formula is part of a line of regular text, this option is not available, but as I suggested above, there would hardly never be any reason to change the default formatting if you are writing a professional\\-looking document.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions. For instance, Microsoft Word 2010 has no feature to number equations. In fact, this was easier before the new formula editor was introduced in Microsoft Word 2007\\. Indeed, using the Equation Editor 3\\.0 OLE object in Office Word 2003 and earlier versions, you could create a centred tab stop at the middle of the page, and a right\\-aligned tab stop at the right margin, and then you could manually number your equations. This simple approach is not possible in Word 2007 and later, because if the formula is not alone on the paragraph, it will be shrunk to \u2018inline style\u2019. Now, it seems that the only reasonable way to number an equation is to use a 3\u00d71 table with a total width of 100 % of the page, and individual cell widths of 10 %, 80 %, and 10 % (say). The middle cell aligns its text at the centre, and here you put the formula. Since the formula is alone in its paragraph (indeed, in the entire cell), it will be rendered the right way. In the right\\-most cell, in which text is right\\-justified, you can manually write the equation number inside parenthesis."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Microsoft Word 2010's Equation Editor, what is the primary factor that determines whether a formula with large operators (like Sigma) displays limits above/below or to the right as super/subscripts?\n\nA) The user's manual selection in the equation's context menu\nB) The equation's position within the document (inline vs. on its own line)\nC) The complexity of the formula\nD) The default settings in Word's options menu\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key factor determining how limits are displayed for large operators in Word 2010's Equation Editor is the equation's position within the document. When an equation is inline with text, it automatically adopts a compact format with limits displayed as super/subscripts to the right. When an equation is on its own line (displayed), it uses the expanded format with limits above and below. \n\nThis behavior is designed to maintain readability in different contexts. Inline equations are kept compact to fit within text lines, while displayed equations have more space to show full notation. The documentation states: \"equations that are positioned as regular 'objects' in the text are shown in small 'inline style', while equations that are put on their own lines are allowed to be shown in their full, expanded, glory.\"\n\nWhile options A and C are related factors, they are not the primary determinants.

Lets briefly touch what each buff does for your team:\n\n**Red**\n\nMost Jungler Champs will get the **Red** buff second to the *Blue* buff, as they require mana to quickly clear Creep Camps. Jungler Champs such as: Lee Sin, and Shyvana tend to go red first as it is most beneficial to them clearing Creep Camps. The **Red** buff also provides a huge advantage to the ADC/Top Laners, although most Junglers dont give up the **Red** buff till the laning phase is over. So making sure it is constantly in use is completely beneficial to your team and can generally be solo'd by Meta Jungle Champs at level 1\\.\n\n**Blue**\n\nAs stated previously the *Blue* buff provides champs a steady amount of mana, so they can burn through their rotations without having to worry to much about being mana starved. Most Junglers will usually allow their mid to have this buff upon its respawn, giving them huge sustaining power for a short period of time and can definitely be the difference between winning mid lane or losing it. This buff should also be grabbed everytime it is up and is easily solo'd by Meta Jungle Champs at level 1\\.\n\n**My Two Cents**\n\nAs someone who jungles occasionally with Udyr, I usually go for a fast Invade on their red (preferably unseen). Grabbing my *Blue* fast then moving on to handing over red to w.e lane is closest. This provides a nice little boost to either top or bot lane (these lanes failing tends to have the biggest impact on the outcome of the match and a mid has very little use for **Red**.) Doing this successfully will win you the game. Now not only is their jungle gonna be behind clearing Creep Camps, but one of your lanes should be winning. This will allow you to sit between the other two lanes and gank over and over while either stealing the enemy camps (since you will be stronger then their jungle) or safely farming your own.\n\nDragon and Baron are very tricky and when you should grab them generally depends on how well your team is doing.\n\n**Dragon**\n\nKilling the Dragon for your team can bring you back from a deficate or put you in a sizable lead. The importance of the Dragon is serious business, as their is no way for your enemies team to gain that gold once you've scored the kill. What I mean is you can take a tower, but all your enemy has to do is take your tower and they are even with you. Same goes for kills, anyone can get a kill because your enemy decides to constantly get out of position. Now getting a Dragon kill, thats the way to help your team. In short 190 gold for your team is a huge advantage, maybe not game winning immediately, but keep getting dragon 2\\-3 times in a row and the game is yours.\n\nWhen to get Dragon, is a little tricky. Never get Dragon without knowing the location if the entire enemy team. For Example if you see them make a 4 man gank up top this is a great time to grab the dragon, or you manage to counter a gank without losing anyone killing off atleast the jungler and adc this is another instance to grab the Dragon. If you would like to sneak in a Dragon make sure you have a vision ward to remove the wards or someone with Oracles, a few minutes **before** you attempt it. The action of taking the Dragon should always be done with the Jungler (atleast early game) and should be quick.\n\n**Baron**\n\nBaron, for most part is just a game ender. Obviously if you are losing and manage to get Baron it can very easily change the tide of battle. But in reality most teams can't manage a Baron kill unless they are dominating the enemy, and do it after crushing the enemy in a team fight. Occasionally you can manage a sneak Baron, or steal it or something but be reasonable, it shouldn't be your game plan. So yah, take Baron when your team has pushed the enemy inside their base or come out of a team fight in good shape. And never attempt to sneak a Baron kill without checking for enemy wards, its a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd yes, they are all very important to kill, games are won and lost over the buffs and gold they provide."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are the jungler for your team in a League of Legends match. Your team has just won a teamfight near the dragon pit, killing 3 enemy champions while losing only 1 of your own. The enemy jungler and ADC are still alive but have retreated to their base. Given this situation, which of the following sequences of actions would be most beneficial for your team?\n\nA) Immediately attempt to take Baron Nashor, then recall to base\nB) Take dragon, then invade the enemy jungle to steal their buffs\nC) Push the nearest lane to take a tower, then take dragon\nD) Take dragon, then set up vision control around Baron Nashor\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most beneficial sequence of actions in this scenario. Here's why:\n\n1. Taking dragon is crucial, as the documentation states: \"Killing the Dragon for your team can bring you back from a deficit or put you in a sizable lead.\" With three enemy champions down, this is a safe and important objective to secure.\n\n2. Invading the enemy jungle to steal their buffs is a strong follow-up action. The documentation emphasizes the importance of taking buffs \"as soon as you can and as often as you can.\" With the enemy jungler forced back to base, you have a prime opportunity to deny them these important resources.\n\n3. This sequence maximizes your team's advantage by securing both global gold (from dragon) and denying the enemy team valuable resources (their jungle buffs).\n\nOption A is too risky, as attempting Baron with the enemy jungler and ADC alive could lead to a steal or a teamfight loss. Option C doesn't capitalize on the enemy's weakened state in their jungle. Option D is a good consideration for later, but doesn't immediately press your team's advantage as effectively as stealing enemy buffs."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/09/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/830943", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/27384/"], "docs_id": 830943, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been often annoyed on Ubuntu when there's a peak in RAM \\-\\- for example when starting Android Studio's emulator or when a Chrome tab freezes \\-\\- the whole GUI freezes and so I'm forced to either wait for it come back or go to TTY and kill the culprit.\n\nIs it possible that Ubuntu manages RAM very differently than Windows does? On Windows, the app itself freezes but not the whole GUI. Is there a way to make Ubuntu behave more like Windows in that respect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Modern OSs use paging to manage memory. It gives some advantadges to the system like being able to use more memory than you have physically, securing some sensitive memory area (like the kernel reserved memory) amongst other things that I can point some reference to if you want to learn more about paging.\n\nBut what is paging?\n===================\n\nI'll skip the technicals and give you an analogy. Imagine you have an encyclopedia collection, A to Z, and being a curious person you like to spend afternoons reading it. You keep all of the encyclopedias on your bookshelf and you have a reading table which you can have 4 books on.\n\nOne day you are reading about \"Sailing\", which is on the letter S encyclopedia. At some point you might need to read about something else related, like \"Winds\" on letter W book. As long as you have it on your reading table you can quickly open it and read what you need, then go back to the \"Sailing\" book. Problem is, since your reading table can only fit 4 books, the chances are high you will need a book that isn't there already. Then you would need to take one of the books from the table back to the shelf, grab the book you need to the reading table and read it.\n\n**Ok, what does this whole book story has to do with my freezes?** Well, the computer does something similar all the time. To be able to use more memory than it physically has, the computer divide memory in *pages*, which are small continuous blocks of memory. Those don't need to be on RAM (the \"reading table\") all the time, they might be stored on your disk (the \"bookshelf\"). If the RAM is full and the CPU needs to read/write on those pages stored on disk, one of the pages on RAM will be stored on disk, and the page requested will be loaded on RAM. \n\nThis is a Kernel job, so it is transparent to the user and programs. But since reading and writing to the disk is **much** slower than reading and writing on RAM, you will notice those freezes.\n\nOn Linux, there is a partition called *swap*, which is used to store those extra pages. Windows does the same thing, but I think it uses a file. The system kernel itself won't freeze, since it will be on locked (\"non\\-swappable\") pages.\n\nThe image below (from an wikipedia article) illustrates the concept of paging (and virtual memory, which we don't need to go into). Those blocks represents the pages being allocated on both memory or disk.\n[![Virtual Memory Paging](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vd5l.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vd5l.png)\n\nI believe the reason it might look like Linux is freezing too, is because Unity (the desktop GUI) might experience the delays caused by this swapping, while on Windows they might keep the desktop GUI code in locked (\"non\\-swappable\") pages. This is just a brainstorm theory though."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of memory management in operating systems, what is the primary purpose of paging and how does it relate to system performance during high memory usage?\n\nA) Paging is used to compress data, allowing more information to be stored in RAM without affecting system performance.\n\nB) Paging is a method to prioritize critical processes, ensuring they always have access to RAM and preventing system freezes.\n\nC) Paging allows the operating system to use more memory than physically available by swapping data between RAM and disk storage, which can lead to temporary system slowdowns during high memory usage.\n\nD) Paging is a technique to defragment RAM in real-time, improving overall system responsiveness by reorganizing memory allocation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the operating system to use more memory than is physically available by dividing memory into small blocks called pages. These pages can be stored either in RAM or on disk (in a swap partition or file). When RAM is full and the CPU needs to access a page stored on disk, the system swaps out a page from RAM to disk and loads the required page into RAM. This process allows for efficient use of memory but can cause noticeable slowdowns or freezes during periods of high memory usage, as disk access is much slower than RAM access. The temporary freezes experienced in Ubuntu during high memory usage are a result of this paging process, where the system is actively swapping pages between RAM and disk to manage memory demands."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/16", "source": ["https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3938", "https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/users/41010/"], "docs_id": 3938, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sorry if this question seems stupid.

The order for these modifications is like\n\n`keycode <x> = <1> <2> <3> <4>`\n\n`<1> <key>`\n\n`<2> <shift-key>`\n\n`<3> <\"Mode_switch\"-key>`\n\n`<4> <shift-\"Mode_switch\"-key>`\n2. \"Mode\\_switch\", not completely sure, but I guess maps to nothing by default. Actually, you can see the code for the key with `xmodmap` and looking for it somewhere at the bottom of the results and finding out what key that code belongs to. What I did was I reassinged it to another key, for example `Super_L`, which is the lefp super key, with these:\n\n```\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Super_L = Mode_switch\"\n\n```\n\nor you can put your own choise in place of `Super_L`\n3. Now, go ahead and edit the column for the four keys you wanted to reassign. Let's find them in your `xmodmap` file:\n\n```\nxmodmap -pke | grep h\n\n```\n\namong the output should be line which says\n\n```\nkeycode 43 = h H h H\n\n```\n\nedit it so that it's like\n\n```\nkeycode 43 = h H Left H\n\n```\n\nto do that, use the command\n\n```\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 43 = h H Left H\"\n\n```\n\nand then try if it worked.\n4. Do that for the rest of the keys you want to map.\n\nI think this is not likely to break anything serious, as long as you can go back and reedit the `keycode`s to their originals. The only scary part was where I mapped \"Mode\\_switch\" to Super\\_L. (**Edit**: this actually disabled my super key, which I was able to get back to work by reversing the assignment, that's `xmodmap -e \"keysym Mode_switch = Super_L\"`.

Considering that villager houses require a 3x3 plot plus a 1-tile wide \"walking path\" around them, what is the minimum distance a cliff would need to be from a player's house to allow a villager to move in between?\n\nA) 6 spaces\nB) 7 spaces\nC) 8 spaces\nD) 9 spaces\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 7 spaces\n\nExplanation: \nA villager's house requires a 3x3 plot (3 spaces) plus a 1-tile wide \"walking path\" around it (2 additional spaces, one on each side), totaling 5 spaces. The player's house also has a 1-tile \"No Build\" zone around it, adding 1 more space. Therefore, the minimum distance needed is 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 spaces.\n\nA is incorrect because 6 spaces wouldn't allow for the villager's required walking path.\nC and D are incorrect because while a villager could fit in 8 or 9 spaces, these aren't the minimum required.\n\nThis question tests understanding of space requirements in the game, as well as the ability to calculate and apply this information to a specific scenario."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/20", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/63989", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/7668/"], "docs_id": 63989, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using ArcMap 10\\.1\\.\n\n**The background**: I have an .mxd that I intend to roll out across the company as our default template for all future maps/figure production.

Here are the assumptions:\n\n* The DS3231 is more accurate.\n\nThe DS3231 accuracy is \u00b12 ppm. The *basic* accuracy of STM32F407 is 5 ppm. However it also has digital calibration feature that allows you to output clock to external pin for measurement and subsequent calibration in 0\\.95 ppm steps.\n\nSo, the achievable accuracy of MCU RTC is **2 times better** than external RTC.\n\n* The power consumption is less with external RTC.\n\nDS3231 consumes 110 \u00b5A in standby mode. STM32F407 requires only 4 \u00b5A in standby mode with SRAM backup or 3\\.3 \u00b5A without backup. Note, that even if you use external interrupt to wake up MCU, both of them will be consuming power in standby.\n\nSo, the power consumption with DS3231 is **33 times more** than with internal RTC only.\n\n* MCU can not calculate Date Time directly.\n\nHere is a quote from the datasheet: \"*Two 32\\-bit registers contain the seconds, minutes, hours (12\\- or 24\\-hour format), day (day of week), date (day of month), month, and year. Compensations for 28\\-, 29\\- (leap year), 30\\-, and 31\\-day months are performed\nautomatically.*\" Not only that, but it also can be programmed for Daylight Saving Time compensation, something that DS3231 cannot do.\n\nSo, RTC in STM32F407 can do **everything DS3231 does, and more**.\n\nTo summarize, there is no need whatsoever to use DS3231 with STM32F407\\.\n\nHaving said that, there is a way to reduce power consumption even more, by using nano\\-power external timer, like [TPL5110](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpl5110.pdf) to switch MCU power supply OFF completely. In this case (called VBAT mode) the RTC will continue running, consuming only 0\\.96 \u00b5A from backup battery. The timer itself adds negligible 35 nA, for total consumption under 1 \u00b5A (3 \u00b5A savings, compared to standby mode)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a low-power embedded system with accurate timekeeping capabilities. Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of an STM32F407 microcontroller compared to an external DS3231 RTC?\n\nA) The DS3231 provides better accuracy than the STM32F407's internal RTC.\n\nB) Using the DS3231 results in lower overall power consumption for the system.\n\nC) The STM32F407's internal RTC cannot handle date and time calculations directly, necessitating the use of an external RTC.\n\nD) The STM32F407's internal RTC offers better accuracy, lower power consumption, and more features than the external DS3231.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe STM32F407's internal RTC is superior to the external DS3231 in several ways:\n\n1. Accuracy: The STM32F407 can achieve \u00b12 ppm accuracy with calibration, which is twice as good as the DS3231's \u00b12 ppm.\n\n2.

It can even be programmed for Daylight Saving Time adjustments, which the DS3231 cannot do.\n\n4.

This is permanently mounted to a service\\-pole outdoors.\n\nI need to add power from that pole to a small cabin 530' away. There will be a 100A panel at the cabin.\n\nI am worried about voltage drop, but will only need about 50A of service to the cabin. \n\nI will be able to bury the wire 3' without problem I suspect, but I am not sure what gauge wire to use. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is why Tesla won the War of the Currents\n=============================================\n\nThe great advantage of moving power around as AC is that one can step up the voltage easily using a *transformer* to move it a long distance with minimal losses, then step it back down to something more suitable for household utilization when it arrives at its destination. While this is normally the province of electric utilities and heavy industrial facilities, nothing in the National Electrical Code *prohibits* the application of dry\\-type distribution transformers in a more...residential setting, so given the length of your run, the use of a transformer at each end to step the voltage up for the run and back down at the cabin is an option here.\n\nI will cover the conventional (no transformers) way of doing it, first, with example pricing, and then show what it takes to use the genius of AC power distribution to *your* advantage here, again with example pricing. If you are not comfortable with any of the installation instructions here, of course, *please* speak with an electrician \\-\\- most electricians who have worked in the commercial/industrial space should be comfortable with installing a setup of this nature.\n\nDoing it the hard way, first\n----------------------------\n\nWithout the aid of transformers, we wind up running 240V @ 50 or 60A over the 530' distance. This requires *fat* wire in order to keep voltage drop from becoming excessive, (3% is the typical limit for feeders) \\-\\- a typical choice would be 3/0 aluminum XHHW\\-2 for 50A (you could use 250kcmil instead for 60A, but the bump of two wire sizes should tell you why this isn't promising already), and you'd need 3 of those \\+ a 4AWG (10AWG is the minimum for 60A, but the upsize for voltage drop forces us to upsize the grounds by the same ratio as per 250\\.122(B)) bare copper ground for this, as well as 540' (the extra is so we can do the stub\\-ups at the end) of 2\" (the wires in question take up about 465 mm2 of fill, so it's slightly too fat a run for a 1\\.5\" conduit) Schedule 80 PVC conduit and fittings. (We are doing the run in conduit in both cases as it'd be nonsensical to trench direct bury cable this far only to have to dig it all up again if requirements changed in the future.)\n\nAs to cost? The PVC costs $3 a foot or thereabouts, so we are out $1690 for the conduit here ($1620 for the conduit, and $70 for the fittings). Adding the phase and neutral wires puts us at another $.85/ft, or $1377 for 540' per conductor (so we have some left over to terminate with), and last but not least, the ground wire adds $.73/ft, or another $395\\. This adds up to nearly $3500, quite the sum for providing electric service to a humble cabin, no?\n\nIt's *transformer* time!\n------------------------\n\nHowever, with a pair of transformers of appropriate rating, we can step the voltage up to 480V for the run, allowing us to use 6AWG copper or 4AWG aluminum for the phase and neutral conductors instead. Furthermore, we can get rid of a wire by running the 480V as single\\-phase instead of split\\-phase, leaving us with a single hot, a neutral, and a ground, at the cost of needing a beefier overcurrent device in one spot, which isn't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things, as it turns out.\n\nThe transformers we need are what are called *dry\\-type distribution transformers*. Unlike the oil\\-filled transformers on utility poles (which can burst into flame under abuse), these transformers have their windings air\\-cooled and use flame retardant insulation materials, rendering them fire\\-safe for use in or on buildings of all types. Specifically, we need a pair of NEMA 3R (outdoor rated), 15kVA (15,000 Volt\\-Ampere, or equivalently 15kW of resistive load) dry\\-type transformers with 240/480V primaries and 120/240V secondaries, the slash indicating that that side of the transformer can be wired for either voltage. These cost about $650 apiece if you can get a good price on them, particularly if you can find used ones in your area, and you will need two, putting your cost for the transformers at about $1300 for the pair.\n\nWith this, we can use 4AWG aluminum XHHW\\-2 for the hot, neutral, and ground wires, giving us a wire cost of $422\\. These wires only take up 150mm2 of fill, as well, so we can downsize the conduit to 1\\.5\" and still have ample fill left over. This translates into a conduit cost of $1/ft, or $600 once the fittings ($20 for the pair) and expansion fittings ($40 for the pair) are included atop $540 or so of conduit.\n\nLast but not least, we'll need a way to protect the conductors between the two transformers, and the primary side of the cabin\\-transformer, from overcurrent. The most cost\\-effective way to do this is with *fuses* due to the fact modern fuses give you better voltage ratings for your money than circuit breakers do. A fuse block will also be needed here: the appropriate fuse, namely a 30A, 600V, Class J fuse, costs roughly $10 apiece, and a matching fuse block for Class J fuses adds another $20\\.\n\nThis sums up to a cost of about $2400 including some miscellaneous parts (such as a 1\" RMC or EMT run from the cabin's transformer to the cabin's loadcenter), or about a thousand dollars less than not using the transformers. Even if you can only get a bad ($1000 a piece) price on 15kVA single phase transformers, this is still cost\\-competitive with the straightforward approach.\n\nImplementing the transformer approach\n-------------------------------------\n\nImplementing things The Hard Way\u2122 is a well\\-trodden path, so I will not cover it further here. The transformer\\-based approach, though, requires a few different elements, so we will go over the implementation caveats first, and then cover the procedure involved in doing this.\n\n### Notes, cautions, and caveats\n\nFirst off, the transformers will need homes \\-\\- at 220lbs a piece, these are *the* heaviest pieces of electrical equipment you will ever meet, atop being quite bulky (nearly 30\" tall, almost 24\" wide, and another 15\" deep)! If you want to hang the transformer at the pole from the pole, this is possible, but will require quite a *hefty* crossmember for the transformer's mounting brackets to bolt to and a metal shield attached to the bottom to prevent sparks from starting a fire should the transformer fail; otherwise, a concrete slab with appropriately placed studs can be used to *padmount* the transformer onto the ground. Likewise, the transformer at the cabin can be bolted to a sturdy crossmember integrated into the frame of the cabin (with a spark shield if outdoors), or set on a studded concrete slab.\n\nFurthermore, you must be able to mount the cabin's loadcenter in a place with sufficient clear working space \\-\\- this may require some slightly tricky conduit routing to do so. Otherwise, trenching the conduit in and pulling the wires from the pole\\-transformer to the cabin\\-transformer is as you would do for any other underground installation, and so is the short conduit run and pull of 4AWG Al from the cabin\\-transformer to the cabin's loadcenter.\n\nNote also that you will *need* to torque all connections (both mechanical screw lugs and bolted joints) to manufacturer specified torques using a torque screwdriver or torque wrench calibrated in inch\\-pounds. You will also need to identify wires correctly \\-\\- 240V wires can use conventional black/red/white phase taping in this scheme if they are not already correctly color coded, but the 480V wires should be identified using *yellow* for hot and *grey* for neutral, with green being suitable for ground as always \\-\\- this helps prevent embarrassing disasters involving 480V power being fed to 120 or 240V appliances. In fact, you should apply the phase tape to the wires *before* you put the wires together and pull them through \\-\\- this makes sure the wires are properly identified at both ends, which will avoid mixups down the road.\n\nLast but not least, all of this, especially the 480V work, *must* be done with the power off, and preferably locked out at the pole using a lockoff and cheap padlock fitted to the newly installed breaker in the pole's loadcenter. This is because 480V not only will shock the living daylights out of you, it can *blow you to high heaven* in what is called an *arc flash* event. \n\n### Finally, the how\\-to\n\nAs to wiring this all \\-\\- the wires from the 50A or 60A breaker that will feed this all (using whatever Chapter 3 wiring means you wish \\-\\- you only need 2 hots and a ground here, so you can use 4AWG Al XHHW\\-2 in 3/4\" or 1\" metal conduit, or a short length of 6/2 UF with cable clamps at each end for that matter) in the pole's loadcenter go to the X1 and X4 terminals on the pole\\-transformer, while the X2 and X3 terminals should be jumpered together if they are not shipped that way from the factory. Likewise, H2 and H3 should be jumpered together on the 480V side, with H1 jumpered to one of the fuse block's lugs, and H4 jumpered to a connector that also is jumpered to the transformer's grounding stud \\-\\- there will need to be two ports left on this connector, as both neutral and ground will connect to it. (It serves as a *bonding point* for the *separately derived system* created by the pole\\-transformer, in other words.)\n\nWe then move onto the cabin \\-\\- the H2 and H3 terminals are jumpered together on the cabin\\-transformer, taking care of the primary side for now. The X2 and X3 terminals on the cabin\\-transformer are jumpered together and also connected to the *neutral* wire running off to the cabin's loadcenter, which is taped white, while the X1 and X4 terminals each connect to one hot wire running off to the cabin's loadcenter. In the loadcenter, the white\\-taped neutral wire from X2/X3 lands on the neutral lug, while the wires from X1 and X4 individually land on one hot lug of the main breaker each, and the bonding screw or strap is *installed* if it is not already present. Again, this is because the transformer is providing isolation from the rest of the mains\\-world for us, giving us a *separately derived system* at the cabin.\n\nAt this point, if all is going well, you will want to perform a test (or have an electrician perform a test for you) *before* you make the final connections and energize this configuration. In particular, you or your electrician should perform an *insulation resistance test* using a special high\\-voltage insulation tester (often called a \"Megger\") on the long run of wires before hooking them up to at either end. This will show if the wires were damaged during the pulling process, preventing a nasty breakdown and fault\\-finding process down the road.\n\nOnce the wires pass such a test, you can then make the final connections. The yellow\\-taped hot wire in the long run connects to the open terminal on the fuse block, while the grey\\-taped neutral and green\\-taped ground wires go to the connector in the jumper from H4 to the transformer's ground stud. At this point, the fuse can be installed into the fuse block as well.\n\nMoving on to the final connections at the cabin, we then hook the yellow\\-taped hot wire up to the H1 terminal on the cabin\\-transformer and the grey\\-taped neutral wire up to the H4 terminal on the cabin\\-transformer. Last but not least, the green\\-taped ground wire gets hooked up to the ground lug on the cabin\\-transformer.\n\nAs to the rest of the cabin\n---------------------------\n\nThe rest of the cabin is wired the same way either way. You will need a grounding electrode system at the cabin in any case, and the panel at the cabin must have a main breaker in it to serve as a shutoff, whether it is a subpanel (in the conventional approach) or a main panel (in the transformer approach). Furthermore, there is no sense in being stingy on panel spaces here \\-\\- I would use a 100 or 125A, 30 space, main breaker panel at the cabin if I were in your shoes, as adding breaker spaces later is far more expensive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is tasked with providing power to a cabin 530 feet away from the main electrical service.

Which of the following setups would be most appropriate for this scenario?\n\nA) Use a single 15kVA transformer at the main service, step up to 480V for transmission, and use 6AWG copper wire for the run\nB) Use two 15kVA transformers, one at each end, step up to 480V for transmission, and use 4AWG aluminum wire for the run\nC) Use a single 30kVA transformer at the cabin, transmit at 240V, and use 3/0 aluminum wire for the run\nD) Use two 7.5kVA transformers, one at each end, step up to 240V for transmission, and use 2AWG copper wire for the run\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate setup for this scenario. Using two 15kVA transformers (one at each end) allows for stepping up the voltage to 480V for transmission over the long distance, which significantly reduces voltage drop and allows for smaller wire size. The 4AWG aluminum wire is sufficient for this setup and is more cost-effective than copper. This configuration balances efficiency, cost, and practicality.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses only one transformer and copper wire, which would be more expensive than aluminum.\n\nOption C is incorrect because using a single transformer at the cabin and transmitting at 240V would require much larger wire (3/0 aluminum) to compensate for voltage drop over the long distance, increasing costs significantly.\n\nOption D is incorrect because 7.5kVA transformers would be undersized for the 50A service requirement, and stepping up to only 240V would not provide as much benefit in terms of reducing wire size and voltage drop compared to 480V."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/10", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/298776", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/53015/"], "docs_id": 298776, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found the following note with a set of test leads we use for our Agilent 34461A[\\[1]](https://www.atecorp.com/products/keysight-technologies/34461a)[\\[2]](http://www.tequipment.net/Agilent/34461A/):\n\n> This Test Lead Set is designed for use with the Agilent 34xxxA Multimeters, and also the U274A, U3401A, and U3402A Multimeters.

The webservice has no rest support which is something we do want. It will also never support such a thing in nearby future. Therfore, to achieve this we need to place the rest layer between the soap webservice and our application.\n\nAs we eventually want to move our coldfusion application to a new language we do not want to build the \"layer\" in coldfusion.

You want to move to a new application which will be a client of the web service but you don't want to get any of the old dated ickyness of the web service on your nice new clean application. So you want to protect it by wrapping the old web service in REST. \n\nThis idea may be workable but it also may be tragically flawed. It really depends on how the SOAP web service is designed. REST is more than simply a protocol. It's a style of building a protocol. It may be that your SOAP web service is architected in a way that is incompatible with following that faithfully.\n\nThis nagging concern wont go away until you have this working no matter what I say so I'll show the best way to get this working. For now, forget that the SOAP web service exists.\n\nInstead design the REST service around what you know the application will actually need. Follow all the best REST principles here and don't support everything that you might someday need. Only things regularly used today.\n\nNow with that REST design that can support your applications needs ask yourself: can you map to your SOAP web service in a reasonable way? Adapting might be significant work. But if you can do it you'll have a well designed REST interface to support your application. \n\nOne of my favorite techniques is **let use drive design**. I'm applying it here as a way to let you evaluate how feasible this approach is for your case with minimal effort.\n\nSure performance may take a hit but never guess at how much. Measure how much with the simplest test you can. This approach lets you build that test before you rewrite the whole application.\n\nYou can even do a differential performance test that retrieves the same thing as the above REST test directly through SOAP. Now you can see exactly what your added overhead is costing you just by comparing times. \n\nThis may seem like a fair bit of work but it's work you would have had to do anyway. By putting it up front it lets you settle the issue before doubt about it seeps into the rest of your design.\n\nTo speed testing consider investing time with some client emulating tools that can drive these protocols: Postman, Insomnia, Curl..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to build a REST API layer on top of an existing SOAP web service.

This \"let use drive design\" technique allows for a well-designed REST interface that supports the application's requirements while minimizing unnecessary complexity.

Each speaker evolves a personal, 'idiolectal' approach; but there are a couple of general tendencies which make these word\\-final clusters easier.\n\n* The final consonant is 'carried over' to head the following syllable if this results in an acceptable syllable head. In your example, for instance, the collocation *tufts out* is read as if it were *tuft sout*. The cluster /st/ is a frequent syllable head, so the word *Borstal* is spoken *Bor stal*. Occasionally this will involve eliding the beginning of the following syllable: *tufts had*, for instance, would be spoken as *tuft sad*.\n* Stops (/p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/) which close a syllable or occur before a consonant are not aspirated, and if a following consonant has the same point of articulation they virtually disappear. In your example, /t/ and /s/ have the same point of articulation, and the /t/ is discernible only as a slight sharpening of the attack on the /s/ \\-\\- which, as said, heads the following syllable. There's not even a complete closure of the airflow, only a slightly marked narrowing: /tuf\\-sout/. (I have no idea how the IPA represents this.) This will be true at the end of a sentence, too, where there's no carryover: *He pulled his hair out in tufts* .. /tuf\\-s/\n\nThe most useful thing to keep in mind is that people don't speak in words but 'utterances', and they will redistribute the word boundaries to suit established oral patterns."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When pronouncing consonant clusters like \"fts\" in the word \"tufts\", what is the most natural approach for native English speakers?\n\nA) Carefully enunciate each individual consonant sound\nB) Completely omit the middle consonant\nC) Redistribute the consonants across syllable boundaries\nD) Replace the cluster with a single consonant sound\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the documentation, native English speakers naturally redistribute consonants across syllable boundaries when pronouncing difficult consonant clusters. This process, known as resyllabification, makes pronunciation easier and more natural.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation states that carefully pronouncing all consonants is \"more work than it's worth\" and sounds unnatural.\n\nOption B is not accurate. While some elision may occur, completely omitting the middle consonant is not the typical approach.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the documentation doesn't suggest replacing the entire cluster with a single consonant sound.\n\nThe documentation provides examples of how this redistribution works:\n1. In \"tufts out\", it's pronounced more like \"tuft sout\".\n2. The /t/ in \"tufts\" is barely noticeable, mainly serving to sharpen the attack on the /s/ sound.\n3. The final /s/ may be carried over to the next syllable if it forms an acceptable syllable head.\n\nThis redistribution follows natural speech patterns and makes difficult consonant clusters more manageable for speakers."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/25", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/32211442", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4940456/"], "docs_id": 32211442, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Problem:** I have a query file that have a `@@procid` statement.

I didn't get the example showed on that page. \n\nOr did I misunderstand this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The @@procid is the identifier associated with the current executing stored procedure, trigger, or user defined function. It is an internal number sql server uses to keep track of these items in the system. So with this id you can look up what object is associated with it. So in the following example: \n\n`SET @ProcName = OBJECT_NAME(@@PROCID);`\n\nGets the procedure name, because OBJECT\\_NAME is a function which gets the name from the `@@PROCID`. \n\nThe example is a little contrived, because the question ultimately becomes 'why not just hard code the name?' The point of @@Proc is so that if you don't know what is executing (maybe dynamic code or such), you have a way of determining what is being executed at that point in time without having to hard code that information everywhere."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In SQL Server, what is the primary purpose of using @@PROCID and how does it relate to OBJECT_NAME() function?\n\nA) @@PROCID returns the remainder of a division operation, and OBJECT_NAME() converts this remainder to a string.\n\nB) @@PROCID returns the current date and time, and OBJECT_NAME() formats it into a readable string.\n\nC) @@PROCID returns an internal identifier for the currently executing stored procedure, trigger, or user-defined function, and OBJECT_NAME() can convert this ID to the actual object name.\n\nD) @@PROCID returns the number of rows affected by the last query, and OBJECT_NAME() converts this number to the name of the affected table.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: @@PROCID is a system function in SQL Server that returns the internal identifier (ID) of the currently executing stored procedure, trigger, or user-defined function. This ID is used by SQL Server to keep track of these objects in the system. The OBJECT_NAME() function can then be used with this ID as its argument to retrieve the actual name of the object.

While port forwarding can work for FTP servers behind NAT, it requires the router's firewall to be \"FTP-aware.\" This is because FTP uses a control connection on a standard port (usually 21) but establishes data connections on dynamic ports. An FTP-aware firewall can properly handle this behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simple port forwarding isn't always sufficient for FTP due to its use of dynamic ports.\n\nOption C is too extreme and incorrect, as port forwarding can work for FTP under certain conditions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while abandoning FTP might be advisable for security reasons, the question doesn't ask about the most secure option, and HTTP isn't typically used for file transfers in this context.

As \\Y increases with each frame of the animation (from 1 to 25 or 1 to 50 in the examples), more points are added to the visualization. These points are positioned at 5/\\X, which means they get closer and closer to 0 as \\X increases. The opacity of each point is set to \\X/\\Y, making points closer to 0 appear more faded, enhancing the accumulation effect. This creates the visual impression of points accumulating at 0 while becoming denser and more numerous as the animation progresses."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/20", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/66312", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1928/"], "docs_id": 66312, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new to the FPGA world, and there seems to be gazzilions of boards and FPGA vendors.

From the charms bar (or `Win`\\+ I), click Settings / Change PC settings / Update and recovery / Recovery/ Advanced startup / Restart now.\n4. Use the command `shutdown /r /o`\n5.

Press the `Win` key and type `cmd` in the search box, then hold\n`Ctrl`\\+`Shift` and press `Enter` to launch the Command Prompt with administrator privileges.\n2. Type the following command into the Command Prompt:  \n\n`bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no`  \n\nThis turns off the Advanced Boot Options menu completely so pressing F8 doesn\u2019t do anything.\n3. To enable F8 again, type the following into Command Prompt:  \n\n`bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu yes`\n\nHowever, a knowledgeable user can still force it via :\n\n* The `Safe Boot` option from MsConfig (needs Administrator privilege).\n* This won't work for a multiboot system.\n* The boot menu will still show after an improper startup/shutdown or sudden loss of power etc.\n\n**Disable Access to Control Panel and PC settings**\n\nTo enable or disable access to the Control Panel, PC settings, and all settings in them for all or specific users in Windows 8\\.\n\nWhen disabled, this setting prevents from starting `Control.exe` and `SystemSettings.exe`, which are the program files for Control Panel and PC settings. As a result, users cannot start Control Panel or PC settings, or run any of their items in them from any other location as well.\n\nYou must be signed in as an administrator, as\nthis requires using `regedit` to do some registry work.

From Eric Partridge, *A Dictionary of Slang \\& Unconventional English*, eighth edition (1984\\):\n\n> **pansy,** n. A very effeminate youth; a homosexual: from ca. 1925\\. Cf. *Nancy (boy)*. Also *pansy\\-boy*: from ca. 1930; *New Statesman and Nation*, 15 Sep. 1934, concerning the fascist meeting in Hyde Park on 9 Sep., notes that there were, from the crowd, 'shouts about 'pansy\\-boys'\".\n\nWith regard to *Nancy*, Partridge has this:\n\n> **Nancy, Miss Nancy, Nancy boy.** A catamite: (low) coll. C.19\u201320\\. Also as adj.: rare before C.20\\. Hugh Walpole, *Vanessa*, 1933, 'But he isn't one of those, you know. Not a bit nancy.'\u20142\\. Also, an effeminate man: C.19\u201320\\. Cf. *molly* \\[which goes back at least to 1879, with the same meaning].\u20143\\. (Only as *nancy*, *N\\-*.) The breech, esp. in *ask my Nancy*: low (perhaps orig. c\\[ant]): ca. 1810\u20131910\\. (Vaux.) Cf. *ask mine arse!*\n\nJohn Ayto \\& John Simpson, *The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang* (1994\\) has these relevant entries:\n\n> **pansy** *mainly derog. noun* **1** An effeminate man; a male homosexual. Also **pansy\\-boy**. 1929\u2013. \\[Citation from 1960 omitted.] *adjective* **2** Of a man: effeminate, homosexual. 1929\u2013. \\[Citation from 1951 omitted.]\n\nRobert Chapman \\& Barbara Kipfer, *Dictionary of American Slang*, third edition (1995\\) similarly gives a first occurrence date of 1929 for *pansy*. And Tony Thorne, *The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang* (1990\\) has this entry:\n\n> **pansy** *n* a male homosexual or an effeminate, effete, or weak male. A word first used in this context in the 1920s and well\\-established until the late 1960s. It survives mainly in the speech of the middle\\-aged and elderly.\n\nThe earliest Google Books match for *pansy* in the effeminate sense is from the [Class of '09 notes](https://books.google.com/books?id=XhJbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA652&dq=%22pansy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=laiDVb2iFoLBsAWLs4KYDA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&q=%22pansy%22&f=false) in *The Princeton Alumni Weekly* (March 28, 1930\\), where it appears as an adjective:\n\n> They have installed a ping\\-pong table in the new addition of the Princeton Club of Ne York, and ardent devotees thus far are Larry Waterman, John Nutting, and your correspondent. We old codgers are right spry, considering our creaking joints and dimming eyesight. Incidentally, any of you birds who regard ping\\-pong as a **pansy** game are hereby challenged. We three valiants guarantee to put you in your place and alter your opinion.\n\nClaude McKay, [*Home to Harlem*](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmZ6NmtYOMAC&pg=PA32&dq=%22pansies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V7KDVe7gBMiSsAWl6rzgAQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22pansies%22&f=false) (1928\\) uses the term *pansies* to refer to the female companions of *dandies*:\n\n> Brown girls rouged and painted like dark **pansies**. Brown flesh draped in colorful soft clothes. Brown lips full and pouted for sweet kissing. Brown breasts throbbing with love.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> All round the den, luxuriating under the little colored lights, the dark dandies were loving up their **pansies**. Feet tickling feet under tables, tantalizing liquor\\-rich giggling, hands busy above.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> She stopped more than usual at Jake's table. He gave her a half dollar. She danced a jagging jig before him that made the giggles rise like a wave in the room. The **pansies** stared and tightened their grip on their dandies. The dandies tightened their hold on themselves. They looked the favored Jake up and down. All those perfect struts for him. Yet he didn't seem aroused at all.\n\nNone of the slang dictionaries I consulted cite this usage of *pansy*, so it may have been McKay's own invention and not an instance of found slang. Still, it occurs at just about the time when the \"homosexual or effeminate\" sense of *pansy* was emerging. \n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**Derivation of the Term**\n\nNone of the reference works I've checked offers any discussion of how pansy came to be applied to effeminate or homosexual men beyond Merriam\\-Webster's listing it as a later definition drawn from the flower sense of *pansy*. The simplest explanation is essentially that a pansy is a delicate flower, and so (in the 1920s, at any rate) to call a man a delicate flower was to call him effeminate. To mix things up a bit, I suggest four additional theories, some more interesting than others, below.\n\n---\n\n***Theory \\#1: Derived from the pansy as a 'love philtre'*** \n\nT. F. Thiselton\\-Dyer [The Folk\\-Lore of Plants](https://books.google.com/books?id=_cdHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=%22pansy+on+the+eyes+of+Titania%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UseDVZnnAsepogSygoOICw&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22pansy%20on%20the%20eyes%20of%20Titania%22&f=false) (1889\\), has this brief comment on the pansy:\n\n> In very early times flowers were much in request as love\\-philtres, various allusions to which occur in the literature of most ages. Thus, in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" Oberon tells Puck to place a pansy on the eyes of Titania, in order that, on awaking, she may fall in love with the first object she encounters.\n\nIn *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, the flower is identified as \"a little western flower\" that maidens call \"love\\-in\\-idleness,\" and Oberon instructs Puck, \n\n> Fetch me that flower\\-\\-the herb I showed thee once;/The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid/Will make a man, or woman, madly dote/Upon the next live creature that it sees.\n\nAnother term for the pansy was \"heart's\\-ease.\" And in *Hamlet*, Ophelia (gone mad) says, \"and there is pansies, that's for thoughts\"\u2014thereby identifying the source of the flower's name in the French *pens\u00e9e*.\n\nThis theory suggests that a person intoxicated by pansy nectar is incapable of any discrimination in his or her amorous feeling, being compelled to love the \"next live creature that it sees,\" whether a man with the head of an ass (in Titania's case) or someone of the lover's own gender. The strongest arguments against this theory are (1\\) Shakespeare doesn't explicitly connect his \"little western flower\" to the name *pansy*; and (2\\) there is no evidentiary link between the love\\-philtre sense here and the use of *pansy* as an epithet for homosexual. \n\n---\n\n**\\*Theory \\#2: Derived from the older slang term 'Nancy' by rhyming slang or similarity**\n\nThere isn't much to say about this theory except that *Nancy* is an older slang term with much the same meaning, and with a variant *Nancy\\-boy* that corresponds to *pansy\\-boy*. The negative here is that (as far as I know) no one has suggested such a derivation or recorded it in books of such terms.\n\n---\n\n**Theory \\#3: Derived from the Pansy Series of books for girls\\***\n\nIn the late 1800s, a series of at least 50 books marketed by the publisher as being for both boys and girls but focusing on girls. An advertisement for \"Pansy\" books at the front of [*One Commonplace Day*](https://books.google.com/books?id=DwYtAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP6&dq=%22at+all+comparable+with+Pansy%27s%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7GSDVbr_O5C7ogTXyab4DQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22at%20all%20comparable%20with%20Pansy%27s%22&f=false) (1886\\) by Pansy \\[Isabella Alden] prefaces a list of the available volumes with this introduction:\n\n> **\"PANSY\" BOOKS** \n> \n> \n> Probably no living author has exerted an influence upon the American people at large, at all comparable with Pansy's. Thousands upon thousands of families read her books every week, and the effect in the direction of right feeling, right thinking, and right living is incalculable.\n\nEdmund Lester Pearson, [*The Secret Book*](https://books.google.com/books?id=EcAgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA90&dq=%22Some+of+them+were+the+Pansy+books%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_r2DVeH6CYbVoATD-7KYBQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20of%20them%20were%20the%20Pansy%20books%22&f=false) (1914\\) suggests an older boy's reaction to the Pansy books:\n\n> Its benefit \\[that is, the benefit of a subscription volume purchased by one's father \"to help out some worthy person\"] on one human boy, aged, say, about ten years, was impossible to discover. Of a certainty, that boy got his full share of books of a more interesting type at Christmas, but as these were invariably devoured from cover to cover, not later than the evening of Dec. 28th, of the same year, and as there had not been enough Christmases in his experience for him to accumulate a vast number of books, there were still reasons why he had to draw upon the common collection of the town. Some of his own private stock, moreover, had been given him five or six years earlier, and he now turned from them in loathing. They were distressingly juvenile. Some of them were the \u201c**Pansy**\u201d books\u2014I forget exactly what that implies, but I can recall the scornful tone in which the title came to be pronounced.\n\nThe theory here would be that any boy of ten or older who continued to enjoy the wholesome girl\\-centric stories of the \"Pansy\" series must be an effeminate weakling\u2014notwithstanding (and perhaps, in part, because of) the books' \"effect in the direction of right feeling, right thinking, and right living.\" A child who was ten years old in the heyday of the Pansy books (1880\u20131900\\) would have been thirty\\-five to fifty\\-five years old in 1925, and might recall (as Pearson did in 1914\\) \"the scornful tone in which \\[\"Pansy books\"] came to be pronounced.\"\n\n---\n\n***Theory \\#4: Derived from 'pansy,' a popular shade of purple in the mid\\-1920s***\n\n[The Clothier and Furnisher](https://books.google.com/books?id=LgAdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22pansy%22&dq=%22pansy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MliDVbbCFMfcoASJkLho&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjhG), volume 106 (1926\\) \\[combined snippets] notes a movement in the industry to encourage men to buy purple ties:\n\n> The flare for new colors on the part of the men, in the opinion of A. N. Lincoln, secretary of the division, is but a reflection of the color habits of women, for whom sewing silk manufacturers have issued 300 standard colors and sixty seasonal shades of which the newest is **pansy**. Manufacturers look for an improvement in the sale of golf suits and knickers in the Fall.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> There have been reports of the flurry in the necktie market which may as well be nipped in the bud here and now as at any time. That is the report, occurring fairly frequently of late, that **pansy** should be a good color in neckwear this year. Simply because the streets have been full of women wearing this favored shade of purple is no reason to believe it will be a popular color for men, and there are a number of reasons why it should not be.\n> \n> \n> It is not, in the first place, a man's color, or one that can be expected to appeal to a man for his own wear. It is of the peculiar flamboyant, audacious type that is only seized upon by women ; moreover it has never been a really fashionable color among them. Best\\-dressed women of the country have never worn **pansy**, and they certainly will not begin at this late date; and they have excellent reasons for not joining the rush after this color. Their reasons are precisely those which will prevent it from being popular among men. \n> \n> \n> **Color a Bit Too Prominent**\n> \n> \n> The chief point against the color is its too great prominence. The women who set the style foresaw that what has happened would happen, and refused to wear it. What they predicted has happened: the brilliance of the color won it immediate popularity among many classes, and the streets were full of **pansy** dresses. Because of its prominence, it immediately made itself known, and was an old story before it was a new one. It can't be disguised because of its brilliance, and many once\\-proud possessors of **pansy** gowns are wishing now that they hadn't hadn't bought a color that dates itself so obviously. It is so prominent that it marks itself as behind the times just as plainly, and almost as quickly, as it once marked itself ahead. \n> \n> \n> Now in men's ties, the same thing would happen ; only, since **pansy** has already played out its welcome among the ladies, it is now an old story. **Pansy** ties produced right now, at the time of writing, might sell to a few not over\\-particular dressers ; but by the time the mills could turn the color out in quantity, perhaps by the time these words see print, **pansy** will be as dead as a door\\-nail.\n> \n> \n> But if not **pansy**, then what? Colors will still be bright ; but they will not be as brilliant as formerly. The light, bright red that has practically held fort alone lately will have to share the honors with several other colors. Red will be more popular in a little darker shade. Blues will also be good. Browns will follow, and some purples, but not **pansy** purples, will be seen.\n\nThis theory rests on the idea that when clothiers attempted to sell \"pansy purple\" neckwear to men, the only buyers were men who were attracted to a color of a \"peculiar flamboyant, audacious type that is only seized upon by women.\" The timing of this sartorial episode is in line with the emergence of the slang usage of *pansy*. \n\n---\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nI have no idea whether any of the suggested derivations is the actual one\u2014or for that matter, whether more than one of them factored into the usage. Theories 3 and 4 have the advantage of being linked to largely forgotten historical influences, which makes them more appealing (to me), but that doesn't make either of them more likely than the others to be the correct explanation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the origin of the term \"pansy\" as a slang word for an effeminate or homosexual man in the 1920s?\n\nA) It derives from Shakespeare's use of a pansy-like flower as a love potion in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"\n\nB) It comes from the popularity of the \"Pansy Series\" of books for girls in the late 1800s\n\nC) It originates from \"pansy purple\" being a trendy but overly flamboyant color for men's fashion in the mid-1920s\n\nD) It simply refers to the delicate nature of the pansy flower, equating it with perceived male weakness\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the passage presents several theories, the simplest and most widely accepted explanation is that the term derives from equating men to the delicate pansy flower.

It plays on \"coup d'\u00e9tat,\" referring to the attempt to oust Jeremy Corbyn from leadership.\n2. The word \"chicken\" implies cowardice, as the plotters are \"afraid of revealing their treachery\" to their constituents who support Corbyn.\n3. It evokes the image of a \"chicken coop,\" suggesting that Westminster (where MPs work) is like a messy, chaotic place where politicians behave like chickens.\n4. The overall phrase combines these ideas to criticize the coup attempt as cowardly, chaotic, and occurring in an environment where politicians are acting foolishly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it encompasses all aspects of this clever wordplay."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/09/17", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/488015", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/162176/"], "docs_id": 488015, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am learning about the k\\-means clustering algorithm, and I have read that the algorithm is \"Trying to minimise a loss function in which the goal of clustering is not met\".\n\nI understand the basic concept of the algorithm, which initialises arbitrary centroids/means in the first iteration and then assigns data points to these clusters.

Instead, it implicitly minimizes the loss function through its iterative process of updating centroids and reassigning points. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which is closely related to the loss function described in the documentation. Option A is incorrect because k-means doesn't use gradient descent. Option B is wrong because the loss function is relevant to k-means. Option D is incorrect because the initial centroids are typically placed randomly or using heuristics, not based on the loss function."}}
