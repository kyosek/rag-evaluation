[here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/40470/use-lie-sub-groups-of-gl3-r-for-elastic-deformation?)), I mentioned polar decompositions as in F \\= RU where R in SO(3\\) \\& U in symmetric positive\\-semidefinite matrices. In response, I received the following comment: \"The decompositions you mention are well\\-known in the theory of Lie groups, e.g., F\\=RU is called Iwasawa decomposition.\" \n\nI have been trying to understand how a polar decomposition \\& Iwasawa decomposition are related. I have found the following definitions of both.\nIwasawa: G\\=KAN for G in GL(n, R) where K \\= orthogonal matrices (rot'ns ?), A \\= positive diag. matrices \\& N \\= upper triag. matrices with diag. entries \\= 1\\. \nPolar: G\\=KAK where G \\= semi\\-simple Lie group, K \\= maximal compact subgroup of G, A \\= abelian subgroup of G. For GL(n, R), I think K in SO(n) but unsure about A. The only abelian subgroup of GL(n, R) appears to be the set of all nonzero scalar matrices (i.e. scalar multiples of identity matrix). I'm also puzzled by G\\=KAK having 3 terms but F\\=RU only 2\\. \n\nGiven all of this, I'm still unsure how these two decompositions are related. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can obtain the $G\\=KAK$ decomposition from a decomposition of the type $F\\=UR$. To avoid unnecessary complications, let's assume that our reductive group $G$ is a selfadjoint subgroup of $\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$. Then the map $g \\\\mapsto g^{\\-t}$ is an involution of $G$, which is called the Cartan involution and is typically denoted by $\\\\theta$. The first observation to make is that the fixed\\-point set $K \\= \\\\{ g \\\\in G \\\\colon \\\\theta(g)\\=g \\\\}$ of $\\\\theta$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. For example, if $G\\=\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$, then $K\\=\\\\operatorname{O}(n)$.\n\nNext we observe that $\\\\theta$ induces an involution (also denoted by $\\\\theta$) at the Lie algebra level: explicitly, this is the map $X \\\\mapsto \\-X^t$. If $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ denotes the $\\-1$\\-eigenspace of this latter involution, then one has the following result.\n\n> The map $K \\\\times \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\to G$ given by $(k, X) \\\\mapsto k e^X$ is a diffeomorphism.\n\nIn particular, every $g \\\\in G$ can be expressed as $k e^X$ for some $k \\\\in K$ and $X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}$. This decomposition is known as the Cartan decomposition; it is a generalization of the polar decomposition to $G$ (and is, I presume, the $F\\=UR$ decomposition stated in the OP). Indeed, if $G \\= \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$, then $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ is just the set of symmetric matrices, and thus the set $\\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{p}$ consists of symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices.\n\nNow let $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ denote a maximal abelian subspace of $\\\\mathfrak{p}$. Then it can be shown that $A \\= \\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{a}$ is a closed abelian subgroup of $G$ with Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak{a}$. It can also be shown that $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ is unique up to conjugacy via an element of $K$. That is to say, if $\\\\mathfrak{a}'$ is another maximal abelian subspace of $\\\\mathfrak{p}$, then there is a $k \\\\in K$ such that $\\\\text{Ad}(k) \\\\mathfrak{a} \\= \\\\mathfrak{a}'$. With this information we can obtain the decomposition $G\\=KAK$: given $g \\\\in G$, one observes that $p\\=gg^t \\\\in \\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{p}$, say $p\\=e^X$. Thus there is a $k \\\\in K$ such that $\\\\text{Ad}(k)X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}$, and then $e^{\\-\\\\text{Ad}(k)X/2}kg \\\\in K$ (because it is fixed by $\\\\theta$), whence $g \\\\in KAK$.\n\nThis hopefully alleviates your 3\\-terms\\-vs\\-2\\-terms issue.\n\nI'm not aware of any relationship between the Iwasawa decomposition and the $KAK$ (polar) decomposition."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the Cartan decomposition of a reductive Lie group G, which is a self-adjoint subgroup of GL(n,\u211d). Which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the Cartan decomposition and the KAK decomposition?\n\nA) The Cartan decomposition G = K exp(\ud835\udd2d) directly implies the KAK decomposition without any additional steps.\n\nB) The KAK decomposition is obtained from the Cartan decomposition by choosing any element X in \ud835\udd2d and setting A = exp(X).\n\nC) To obtain the KAK decomposition from the Cartan decomposition, one must first find a maximal abelian subspace \ud835\udd1e of \ud835\udd2d, then set A = exp(\ud835\udd1e), and finally use the conjugacy of maximal abelian subspaces under K to decompose any element of G.\n\nD) The Cartan decomposition and KAK decomposition are unrelated, as the former uses two terms (K and exp(\ud835\udd2d)) while the latter uses three terms (K, A, and K).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The KAK decomposition is indeed derived from the Cartan decomposition, but it requires several additional steps:\n\n1. Start with the Cartan decomposition G = K exp(\ud835\udd2d).\n2. Find a maximal abelian subspace \ud835\udd1e of \ud835\udd2d.\n3. Define A = exp(\ud835\udd1e), which is a closed abelian subgroup of G.\n4. Use the fact that any maximal abelian subspace of \ud835\udd2d is conjugate to \ud835\udd1e by an element of K.\n5. For any g in G, consider p = gg^t in exp(\ud835\udd2d), write p = e^X, and find k in K such that Ad(k)X is in \ud835\udd1e.\n6. Use this to show that g can be written as a product in KAK.\n\nOption A is incorrect because additional steps are needed. Option B is wrong because it doesn't account for the maximal abelian subspace. Option D is incorrect as it misunderstands the relationship between the decompositions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/09/12", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/255092", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/103879/"], "docs_id": 255092, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have one layer of polygons that stretch across the U.S., and another layer of all counties in the U.S. In the counties layer is a column with population density for each county.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is to filter the data by polygons that intersect with a county that has a specific population density.

Which of the following methods would be the most efficient way to accomplish this task in QGIS?\n\nA) Use the Buffer tool to expand the county boundaries, then use the Clip tool to extract the overlapping portions of the large polygons.\n\nB) Create a virtual layer using SQL to join the two layers based on spatial intersection and filter by population density.\n\nC) Use the Select by Location tool to choose the large polygons, then manually delete those that don't meet the criteria.\n\nD) Apply a definition query to the county layer to filter by density, then use the Union tool to combine it with the large polygon layer.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and accurate method for this task. Creating a virtual layer allows for both spatial intersection and attribute filtering in a single step. The SQL query can join the two layers based on their spatial relationship (ST_Intersects) and filter the results based on the population density criterion. This approach is both precise and computationally efficient, as it doesn't require creating intermediate layers or manual intervention.\n\nOption A would be unnecessarily complex and might introduce spatial inaccuracies due to the buffering process.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1) If z = a + bi is prime in \u2124[i] and both a and b are non-zero, then N(z) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is always prime in \u2124.\n2) This is proven in the given solution by showing that if N(z) were composite, it would contradict z being prime in \u2124[i].\n3) The proof uses the fact that z divides N(z), and if N(z) were composite, z would have to divide one of its prime factors p. This, combined with z\u0304 also dividing p, leads to N(z) dividing p, which is only possible if N(z) = p, i.e., N(z) is prime.\n\nA is incorrect because N(z) is never composite when z is prime in \u2124[i].\nB is incorrect as it confuses the norm with the trace of a Gaussian integer.\nD is incorrect because the norm is always prime, not dependent on specific values of a and b (as long as they're both non-zero)."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40208549", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/6846468/"], "docs_id": 40208549, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was looking around forums and found a helpful code on how to count lowercase letters in an inputted string.

This is a bit sloppy, because the list of directories in theory could have altered between the two invocations of `find`, but this is not an issue in this case.\n\n```\n/usr/local/src/ccl/ccl-1.8/x86-headers$ ls -laR\n\n[...]\n\n./jni:\ntotal 96\ndrwxr-sr-x 3 faheem staff  4096 Jul 31 00:53 .\ndrwxr-sr-x 9 faheem staff  4096 Jul 31 00:53 ..\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 faheem staff  4096 Jul 31 00:53 C\n-rw-r--r-- 1 faheem staff 19535 Jul 31 00:53 constants.cdb\n[more .cdb files]\n\n./jni/C:\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 faheem staff 4096 Jul 31 00:53 .\ndrwxr-sr-x 3 faheem staff 4096 Jul 31 00:53 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 faheem staff  148 Jul 31 00:53 populate.sh\n\n./libc:\ntotal 1276\ndrwxr-sr-x 3 faheem staff   4096 Jul 31 00:53 .\ndrwxr-sr-x 9 faheem staff   4096 Jul 31 00:53 ..\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 faheem staff   4096 Jul 31 00:53 C\n-rw-r--r-- 1 faheem staff 593125 Jul 31 00:53 constants.cdb\n[more .cdb files]\n\n./libc/C:\ntotal 20\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 faheem staff  4096 Jul 31 00:53 .\ndrwxr-sr-x 3 faheem staff  4096 Jul 31 00:53 ..\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 faheem staff 10544 Jul 31 00:53 populate.sh\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not a job for `find`, since there is no recursion involved.\n\n```\nfor x in */C/populate.sh; do\n  mkdir -- \"${x%%/*}$suffix\"\n  mkdir -- \"${x%%/*}$suffix/C\"\n  cp -p -- \"$x\" \"./${x%%/*}$suffix/C\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nRemove the `-p` option to `cp` if you don't want to preserve the files' modification time.\n\nTo generate a random suffix, BSD/Linux [`mktemp`](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mktemp&sektion=1) is as portable as it gets.\n\n```\nsuffix=$(mktemp -u tmp_XXXXX)\n\n```\n\nIf you want something vaguely random\\-looking and POSIX\\-compliant, this gives a string that changes every second and varies from location to location; you can't really do better with only POSIX tools:\n\n```\nsuffix=$({ hostname; pwd; date; } |\n         cksum | uuencode -m /dev/stdin | awk 'NR==2 {print substr($0,3,5)}')\n\n```\n\nIf you put this code in a makefile, remember to:\n\n* double all `$` signs;\n* put all the code on one line, using `;` instead to separate shell instructions (you can use backslash\\+newline\\+tab to put a line break in the makefile, but that sequence is removed to build the shell command);\n* start the shell snippet with `set -e`, so that it aborts if there is any error."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to create a parallel group of subdirectories with the same structure as an existing directory, but with a random value appended to the directory name.

When I design with 5/5 track/clearance my pours often also become 5 or 8 clearance, because I know the fabs I use can do it at a price I am willing to pay and I know I will have taken care of larger gaps only where they are needed.\n\n((I changed my wording to reflect what I think you mean. More usually planes are used to refer to the dedicated copper planes inside a multilayer PCB where no tracks run through them, where a pour is the copper areas you have on the signal layers of a given potential, such as a ground pour or VCC pour))\n\nIf you have no signals or pads that need to be further away from a ground pour for signal or thermal reasons or you know you have defined special rules for just those occasions, you can just set the general rule to 8 thou/mil as well. If you may have those signals and can't be sure everything takes that into account and on the other hand don't need to isolate your tracks from each other, you can keep it at 12, 15 or whatever.\n\nGenerally having ground between tracks can do little harm (unless the tracks it creeps between are characteristically coupled, like wired network, USB, RS485, etc) and often even improves things, especially if you do not have an actual ground plane on an internal layer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing a PCB with crystal oscillators for an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the datasheet specifications and the actual component values used?\n\nA) The calculated external capacitance (Cext) should always match exactly with the capacitors used in the circuit.\n\nB) The crystal's maximum allowed capacitance load should never be exceeded by the capacitors used in the circuit.\n\nC) Minor discrepancies between calculated values and actual component values are acceptable, as long as the circuit functions properly.\n\nD) The crystal's frequency is not affected by small variations in capacitance values.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation shows that there can be slight differences between calculated values and actual component values used in a working design. For example, the calculated Cext is 20pF, but 18pF capacitors are used. Additionally, the maximum allowed crystal capacitance load is 17.5pF, but 20pF is used in the EVB. These discrepancies suggest that some flexibility is allowed in practical designs, as long as the circuit functions correctly.

This solution doesn't require modifying the Raster Calculator formula, updating QGIS, or using a new dataset."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/11", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/338703", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/118559/"], "docs_id": 338703, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can't really explain using many words besides the title, but here is an image of what I am trying to accomplish.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZw7p.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZw7p.png)\n\nJust a bit of background, so other people might be able to find this later, this is for a Discrete Mathematics class I'm in (I won't go into much detail about the assignment.)

One way to do this is using the `forest` package:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz, border=5pt]{standalone}\n\n\\usepackage{forest}\n\\forestset{%\n  my columns/.style={%\n    for descendants={rectangle, draw}, \n    for children={no edge}, \n    phantom, s sep=1cm,\n  },\n  % Pick one of these styles\n  hidden empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        shape=coordinate,\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n  x empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        content=\\textsf{x}, draw=none\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns, hidden empty nodes [\n  [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [foo [bar [ [qux [quxx]]]]]\n  [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns, x empty nodes [\n  [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [foo [bar [ [qux [quxx]]]]]\n  [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![hidden empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKmhh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKmhh.png)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[![x empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWvYV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWvYV.png)\n\nOf course, `forest` seems like a bit of overkill in this situation, and leaves you with a slightly odd notation in the source...\n\nEDIT: To make the empty nodes use bullets instead of xs, you can replace `content=\\textsf{x}` with `content=\\textbullet`. In this case you might want to also set `inner sep=0` for empty nodes so that the line touches the bullet. On the other hand, it might be easier to just draw the node as a filled circle, as I've done in the example below.\n\nTo add column headers one option is to add a label to the first node in each column, like `[foo, label={Col 1} [bar [baz [qux []]]]]`. In this case you can control the distance between the header and the first node by setting, e.g., `\\tikzset{label distance=1em}`. On the other hand, if you want to write the column header first you could just remove the box and edge from the first node in each column. The resulting code looks like\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz, border=5pt]{standalone}\n\n\\usepackage{forest}\n\\forestset{%\n  my columns/.style={%\n    for descendants={\n      rectangle, draw,\n      anchor=center, % vertically align (empty) nodes at the middle\n      font=\\strut, % make the box size independent of ascenders/descenders\n      l sep=0em, % make the level height independent of box height\n    },\n    for children={no edge,\n      draw=none, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt, font={}, % style of column header\n      for children={no edge,\n        l=2em, % header distance (minimum 1em)\n      }\n    },\n    phantom, % hide the root node\n    s sep=1cm, % distance between columns\n    bullet empty nodes\n  },\n  bullet empty nodes/.style={%\n    delay={%\n      where content={}{%\n        circle, inner sep=.5mm, fill, font={}\n        % draw=none, content=\\textbullet, font={}, inner sep=-1pt,\n      }{},\n    },\n  },\n}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{forest} my columns [\n  [Col 1 [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]]\n  [Col 2 [foo [bar [ [qux [bar]]]]]]\n  [Col 3 [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![bullet empty nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaRWu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaRWu.png)\n\nHere I've also added some things to make it so that ascenders and descenders (or lack thereof) don't change the heights of the boxes and so that the empty nodes add the same height to their columns as non\\-empty nodes (even though the empty node itself is smaller than a non\\-empty node)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX and forest package information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following LaTeX code snippets would correctly produce a column-based representation of strings with bullet points for empty nodes, column headers, and vertically aligned boxes?\n\nA) \n```latex\n\\begin{forest}\n  [Col 1 [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [Col 2 [foo [bar [ [qux [bar]]]]]\n  [Col 3 [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n\\end{forest}\n```\n\nB) \n```latex\n\\begin{forest} my columns [\n  [Col 1 [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]]\n  [Col 2 [foo [bar [ [qux [bar]]]]]]\n  [Col 3 [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n```\n\nC) \n```latex\n\\begin{forest} my columns, x empty nodes [\n  [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]\n  [foo [bar [ [qux [quxx]]]]]\n  [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n```\n\nD) \n```latex\n\\begin{forest}\n  \\forestset{\n    my columns/.style={\n      for descendants={rectangle, draw},\n      for children={no edge},\n      phantom, s sep=1cm,\n    }\n  }\n  [Col 1 [foo [bar [baz [qux []]]]]]\n  [Col 2 [foo [bar [ [qux [bar]]]]]]\n  [Col 3 [foo [bar [baz [ [quxx]]]]]]\n\\end{forest}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct answer because it includes all the necessary elements for the desired output:\n\n1.

The overall structure matches the example given in the documentation, with the correct nesting of nodes to represent the strings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it lacks the `my columns` style and doesn't have the outer brackets for the forest environment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it uses `x empty nodes` instead of `bullet empty nodes` and doesn't include column headers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it defines the `my columns` style within the forest environment, which is not the proper location, and it doesn't include the necessary styling for bullet points and vertical alignment."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/05", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/249589", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/116026/"], "docs_id": 249589, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there an idiom or expression saying or implying that gambling is a good thing?

In fact, it's potentially less secure, if your actual command line is dynamically constructed. Instead of:\n\n```\nexecl(\"/bin/sh\",\"sh\",\"-c\",\"sudo nmap -sS -A 192.168.0.1/24\",NULL);\n\n```\n\nYou should just do:\n\n```\nexeclp(\"sudo\", \"sudo\", \"nmap\", \"-sS\", \"-A\", \"192.168.0.1/24\", NULL);\n\n```\n\nNow you have just two processes: the `sudo` and the `nmap` itself. You know the process ID of the parent (`sudo`) but you don't know the process ID of the child (`nmap`). But it doesn't matter, because you can use a feature of `sudo`: kill the parent (with `SIGTERM`) and it will forward the signal along to the child for you.\n\nYour last remaining problem isn't directly related to the question you're asking, but it's that anyway you probably don't have permission to kill either of these processes anyway! Since `sudo` is involved, which has as its purpose to elevate its privilege, you probably don't have permission to send it or its child signals in the first place."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A programmer is trying to execute a sudo command from within a C program using the exec family of functions.

Both sentences are grammatically proper, but have different meanings, because the conjugations of *to know* are different.\n\n> He looks as if he knew the answer.\n\n*Knew* is past tense. You would use this statement to describe someone who had an opportunity to provide an answer, but did not do so (or did, but incorrectly). The subject *could have* provided the answer *but didn't*, and the opportunity to do so has passed. For example:\n\n> John is unhappy, because his team is going to lose the trivia game. Cheryl interrupted him and got the question wrong. *He looks as if he knew the answer*.\n\nThis is disctinct from:\n\n> He looks as if he knows the answer.\n\n*Knows* is present tense. You would use this statement to describe someone who, right now, appears to be able to provide an answer. The subject *can currently* provide an answer, and it is still possible to do so. For example:\n\n> Who should I call on? Rick *looks as if he knows the answer*. I'll call on him.\n\nRegarding your proposed meanings:\n\n> He is pretending as if he knew the answer. He is not as smart as he can solve the problem.  \n> \n>  He is a smart enough to know. Many people expect him to know the answer\n\nNeither sentence specifically means either of these. The differnce between the two is *when* the subject could answer (in the past or present) rather than whether or not they could. However, *he looks as if he knows the answer* can be used to suggest *many people expect him to know the answer*, because people generally expect appearances to be accurate.

When we write $\\\\int\\_a^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\ dt$, this is just shorthand for $\\\\lim\\_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\int\\_a^x f(t) \\\\ dt$. In your example, if we suppose, as you argue, that the integral does *tend* to $\\- \\\\frac 12$, since $ \\\\int\\_a^{\\\\infty} f(t) \\\\ dt$ is *defined* as what the integral tends to, we could still technically say that the value is $\\-\\\\frac 12$. This is assuming your reasoning is correct, which it is not.\n\nIn reality, the integral does not exist. The reason your reasoning fails is that you ignore the asymptote at $x\\=0$. You can't integrate \"over\" the asymptote. What you should do is split the integral up on both sides of the asymptote and see if both integrals are independently well defined. In this case, they are not. \n\nIn some cases, however, functions with vertical asymptotes are \"integrable\". (\"Integrable\" is in quotes because the Riemann integral assumes $f$ to be bounded on $\\[a,b]$; this is a so\\-called \"improper\" integral, which is basically just a limiting procedure)\n\nExample: Suppose $f(x) \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\|x\\|}}$ in $\\[\\-1, 1]$ and $f(x) \\= 0$ for $x \\\\geq 1$.

What is the probability of the contestant winning?\n\nA) 1/3\nB) 2/3\nC) 1/2\nD) 1/4\n\nCorrect Answer: B) 2/3\n\nExplanation:\nThis question tests understanding of probability and the importance of order in certain scenarios.\n\nA) 1/3 is incorrect. This answer might seem intuitive if one thinks there are three boxes and only one contains the prize, but it fails to account for the fact that the contestant opens two boxes.\n\nB) 2/3 is correct. There are three possible scenarios:\n   1. Prize in first opened box (win)\n   2. Prize in second opened box (win)\n   3. Prize in unopened box (lose)\n   Two out of these three scenarios result in a win, hence 2/3 probability.\n\nC) 1/2 is incorrect.

In this case, it's likely that there's a version incompatibility between Hibernate core (3.2.5) and Hibernate Spatial (1.1.1). The CustomType class in Hibernate core might have changed its constructor signature in a way that's not compatible with the version of Hibernate Spatial being used. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while it might seem plausible, the PostGIS JDBC driver is generally compatible with Hibernate when correct versions are used. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the question states that the classpath contains the necessary JARs. \n\nOption D is possible but less likely, as the configuration seems correct based on the provided information.\n\nTo resolve this, the developer should ensure that the versions of Hibernate core and Hibernate Spatial are compatible with each other, and possibly upgrade to more recent, matching versions of both libraries."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/09/27", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/668308", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/314987/"], "docs_id": 668308, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I calculated the surface temperature of the sun using the energy flux of the sun and the [Stefan\\-Boltzmann equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law), as is seen in the beginning of [this post](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/114972/temperature-on-the-surface-of-the-sun-calculated-with-the-stefan-boltzmann-rule), but I am confused on how this gives the surface temperature of the sun. Is the T we calculated not the average temperature of the star, since we calculated the temperature necessary to produce the intensity of the sun?\n\nTo put it in other words, if I increased the temperature of the center of the Sun, would this not increase the intensity and therefore the surface temperature of the sun?\n\nThe only \"answer\" I can currently come up with is that, by definition, the surface temperature of the sun is just the intensity/energy on the surface, so the statements above must be true. I am unsure if this is actually correct or if there are better justifications.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are right, the answer you get this way is the temperature of the sun's photosphere (what we call the \"surface\" of the sun even though it is not a solid surface). Remember also that the temperature of an object is the mean of a distribution of energies possessed by all the atoms in it, so in this sense the \"averaging\" has already been done for you.\n\nNote also that events in the core of the sun that produce energetic (gamma ray) photons do not communicate those photons immediately to the photosphere. This is because the mean free path between inelastic scatterings is short enough that it takes tens of thousands of years for those photons to rattle around and finally make it to the photosphere and stream off into space. By that time, they are photons of light with a characteristic black\\-body spectrum, possessing a well\\-defined temperature."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student calculates the surface temperature of the Sun using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation and the Sun's energy flux.

This is not the average temperature of the entire Sun, nor does it directly reflect the core temperature. The photosphere is the layer from which most of the Sun's visible light is emitted and is what we perceive as the Sun's surface.\n\nIt's important to note that changes in the Sun's core don't immediately affect the surface temperature. Energy from the core takes thousands of years to reach the photosphere due to numerous scattering events. By the time this energy reaches the photosphere, it has been transformed into a characteristic black-body spectrum with a well-defined temperature, which is what we calculate using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/18", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1359273", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/945372/"], "docs_id": 1359273, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a copy -vn -sn output.m4a`\nto extract audio from an mp4 file.

The home network does not need internet to work internally. The router will still assign IP addresses, if the option is enabled and the network will still work. You just cannot connect to the internet or to your router from the internet. This is why a NAS like this will still work, but only on your internal network, which means only via WiFi provided by said router and from devices connected via Ethernet (LAN) cable. No access from the internet will be possible. This includes phones not connected to the internal WiFi.\n\nNAS means Network Attached Storage, which means, that the device is, in it's essence, a small computer with a connected hard drive. So all the storage remains locally and is, normally, not uploaded to the Internet, unless configured otherwise. The NAS is sharing access to the device via network folders and, most commonly, uses the [SMB Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block). Most NAS also provide other means of access, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and various others. \n\nIf this NAS is not allowing usage without Internet Access, then it is a serious flaw that should not exist and flat out a bad product. It is essentially doing what is commonly called \"phoning home\"."}, "answer": "Question: A company wants to set up a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device on their local network.

The router will still assign local IP addresses and maintain the internal network infrastructure. Devices connected to the router via Wi-Fi or Ethernet (LAN) cables will be able to access the NAS and its shared folders using protocols like SMB. The NAS stores data locally and doesn't require internet access for internal network operations.

Then, ST_Difference subtracts this combined lake geometry from the forest geometry, resulting in a forest polygon with lake areas removed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because finding intersecting lakes is only part of the process, not the main purpose. Option C is incorrect because the query is separating forests and lakes, not merging them. Option D is incorrect because while the result could be used to calculate areas, the query itself is focused on modifying geometries, not calculating areas."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/26", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/115414", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/9508/"], "docs_id": 115414, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just bought a big used tire and hung it as a tire swing.

While SATA does have a higher maximum transfer speed than USB 2.0, the actual read/write speeds of DVDs (around 10.6 Mbit/s) are well below the maximum transfer speed of USB 2.0 (480 Mbit/s).

However, a 100% confidence interval for a normally distributed variable will always cover the entire real line from -\u221e to +\u221e, regardless of sample size. This is because to include 100% of the probability under the normal distribution would require an infinite range.

We have notions of psuedo\\-Riemannian or Riemannian metrics on a manifold, and they differ in the slightest way of being positive\\-definite or not. However, what happens if we drop positive\\-definite AND symmetry? For example, if we had a nondegenerate bilinear form $g\\_p: T\\_p M \\\\times T\\_p M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ that varied smoothly between points. Has this been explored in depth? It appears to me at surface level that one could still concoct connections, curvature, and possibly a notion of parallel transport in this flavor of 'smooth geometry'. A motivation for me to ask is as follows. Suppose $R$ is an $S$\\-algebra where $\\\\Omega\\_{R/S}$ is reflexive and the canonical isomorphism $\\\\phi: \\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\to \\\\Theta\\_{R/S}$ is an isomorphism of $R$\\-modules (i.e. nonsingular varieties). There exists a canonical map $\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\to R$, which is $R$\\-bilinear and nondegenerate, and is given by $\\\\langle \\\\omega, V \\\\rangle \\= l(\\\\omega)$ where $l:\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\to k$ such that $l \\\\circ d\\_{R/S} \\= V$. This induces a morphism $$\\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\phi^{\\-1} \\\\times 1}\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\to R.$$ Natural questions that arise are is this composition $R$\\-bilinear nondegenerate, and when is it symmetric? Which symmetric $R$\\-bilinear forms factor through $\\\\phi^{\\-1} \\\\times 1$? When we work with a manifold and have a metric tensor that is bilinear and nondegenerate, just how interesting is this flavor of curvature (whatever it is supposed to mean)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider a bilinear form $b \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}^\\\\infty (T^\\*M\\\\otimes T^\\*M, \\\\mathbb{R})$ and an affine connection $\\\\nabla \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{\\\\Gamma}^\\\\infty(TM) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{\\\\Gamma}^\\\\infty(T^\\*M\\\\otimes TM)$ whose parallel transport preserves $b$. That can be expressed by the condition $b(\\\\nabla\\_X Y, Z) \\+ b(Y, \\\\nabla\\_X Z) \\= 0$ for all $X, Y, Z \\\\in \\\\Gamma(TM).$\n\nWhen $b$ is symmetric nondegenerate tensor (i.e. a pseudo\\-Riemannian metric), then this $\\\\nabla$ is caleld metric connection. It always exists, but it is not unique! To get a unique connection one has to impose also that $\\\\nabla$ has zero torsion tensor. \n\nWhen $b$ is antisymmetric nondegenerate tensor (i.e. a presymplectic form), then $\\\\nabla$ is known as symplectic connection but this time the uniqueness is not saved by torsion\\-freeness. \n\nThe way to handle these problems in general is to consider one torsion free $b$\\-connection $\\\\nabla$ and study its modification $\\\\nabla \\+ A$ where $A \\\\in \\\\Gamma(\\\\mathrm{End}(TM)).$ Such modified connection preserves $b$ if and only if $b(A(X)Y, Z) \\+ b(Y, A(X)Z) \\= 0\\.$ Torsion\\-freeness is equivalent to $A(X)Y \\- A(Y)X \\= 0\\.$ From this it is obvious that the affine space of torsion\\-free $b$\\-connections is governed by the representation theory of Lie algebra of the isotropy group of $b$. Sometimes you get just the trivial representation, sometimes you get bigger space.\n\nThe punchline here is that connection preserving some tensorial objects are generally not unique.

The space of b-preserving connections can indeed be studied by considering modifications of the form \u2207 + A, where A \u2208 \u0393(End(TM)).

Actually, I observe some weird behavior if I don't standardize my data. For example, `minFunc` suddenly gives me `step direction is illegal` error. Some online reading led me to believe that there is either a problem in your gradient calculation or your data is not standardized. I am sure about my gradient function calculation, I have also check it with the `DerivativeCheck` option. So, that leaves the possibility of data not being standardized. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it is desirable to standardize the data while learning Gaussian processes regression. There are a number of reasons:\n\n1. In common Gaussian processes regression model we suppose that output $y$ has zero mean, so we should standardize $y$ to match our assumption.\n2. For many covariance function we have scale parameters in covariance functions. So, we should standardize inputs to get better estimation of parameters of covariance functions.\n3. Gaussian processes regression is prone to numerical problems as we have to inverse ill\\-conditioned covariance matrix. To make this problem less severe, you should standardize your data.\n\nSome packages do this job for you, for example GPR in sklearn has an option *normalize* for normalization of inputs, while not outputs; see [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20150317010512/http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcess.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which of the following statements best describes the importance and implications of data standardization?\n\nA) Standardization is unnecessary for GPR and can lead to inaccurate results at test time.\n\nB) Standardization is crucial for GPR, but should only be applied to the input features and not the target variable.\n\nC) Standardization is important for GPR, addressing model assumptions, parameter estimation, and numerical stability, but requires careful handling at test time.\n\nD) Standardization in GPR is only needed when using specific optimization algorithms like minFunc.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Answer C is correct because it accurately captures the importance and nuances of data standardization in GPR:\n\n1.

Without this declaration, the compiler doesn't know how to properly call the function, which can lead to undefined behavior and segmentation faults.\n\nOption A is incorrect because defining functions in header files is generally acceptable, especially for small, inline functions.\nOption C is possible but less likely, as a polynomial overflow would typically result in incorrect calculations rather than a segmentation fault.\nOption D is incorrect because the code snippet doesn't show any use of function pointers.\n\nThe correct approach would be to ensure that the function Y(x) is properly declared in the main program, typically by including the header file where Y(x) is defined or by adding an explicit function prototype."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/12", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/54647500", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4189669/"], "docs_id": 54647500, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have this entity:\n\n`AppBundle\\Entity\\Ciudad`\n\n```\nclass Ciudad{\n    ...\n    /**\n     * @ORM\\ManyToOne(targetEntity=\"AppBundle\\Entity\\ComunidadAutonoma\")\n     * @ORM\\JoinColumns({\n     *   @ORM\\JoinColumn(name=\"id_ccaa\", referencedColumnName=\"id\")\n     * })\n     */\n    private $ccaa;\n    ....\n\n    public function getCcaa()\n    {\n        return $this->ccaa;\n    }\n\n    public function setCcaa(ComunidadAutonoma $ccaa)\n    {\n        $this->ccaa = $ccaa;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd the other entity is:\n\n`AppBundle\\Entity\\ComunidadAutonoma`\n\n```\nclass ComunidadAutonoma{\n    properties\n    getters\n    setters\n}\n\n```\n\nIn a controller, I get data from a form, and I\u00b4m triying to deserialize the data into a `Ciudad` entity, but is getting me allways the same error:\n\n`Expected argument of type \"AppBundle\\Entity\\ComunidadAutonoma\", \"integer\" given`\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PADAd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PADAd.png)\n\nIn the form data I send to the action in the controller, the value of the comunidadautonoma is the id of the selected option in a combo:\n\n```\n{\n    parameters...\n    ccaa:7,\n    parameters...\n}\n\n```\n\nIn my controller I have this:\n\n```\n<?php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Serializer;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Encoder\\XmlEncoder;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Encoder\\JsonEncoder;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Normalizer\\ObjectNormalizer;\nuse AppBundle\\Entity\\Ciudad;\n\nclass CiudadController extends Controller\n{\n    public function procesarAction(Request $request)\n    {\n        $encoders = array(new XmlEncoder(), new JsonEncoder());\n        $normalizers = array(new ObjectNormalizer());\n        $this->serializer = new Serializer($normalizers, $encoders);\n\n        $ciudad= $this->serializer->deserialize($parametros['parametros'], Ciudad::class, 'json');\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAm I missing something?Do I need any special configuration to deserializer an entity with a relation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All captures of all matches are returned, so you'd have to group them up.\n\n```\nuse List::Util 1.29 qw( pairs );\n\nfor ( pairs( $str =~ /Name=(.*) Address=(.*)/g ) ) {\n   my @matches = @$_;\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nThat said, it's far more common to grab the matches iteratively.\n\n```\nwhile ($str =~ /Name=(.*) Address=(.*)/g) {\n   my @matches = ( $1, $2 );\n   ...\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When deserializing a Ciudad entity with a ManyToOne relationship to ComunidadAutonoma, you're receiving the error \"Expected argument of type \"AppBundle\\Entity\\ComunidadAutonoma\", \"integer\" given\".

This is likely because the form is sending the ID of the ComunidadAutonoma (an integer) rather than the full object. The serializer is attempting to set this integer directly into the ccaa property, which triggers the type mismatch error.\n\nTo resolve this, you would need to modify your deserialization process to fetch the ComunidadAutonoma object using the provided ID before setting it on the Ciudad entity.
