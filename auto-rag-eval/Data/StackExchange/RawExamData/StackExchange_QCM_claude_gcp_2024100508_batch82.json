It takes three arguments: the rotation angle, the slant angle, and the equation itself. \n\nThe \\slbox command is another custom command that applies the slanting effect.

When `bash` is run in login mode, it doesn't read/execute `~/.bashrc`. Instead, it reads and executes `~/.profile`. If you want to put things in your `~/.bashrc` and have them read and executed in every new Terminal window, you need to create a shell script file called `~/.profile`, and have that file contain a command that looks for your `~/.bashrc` and reads and executes it.\n\nIn case the verb \"source\" threw you off: \"sourcing\" a shell script file is when a shell (such as `bash`) reads shell commands from a file and runs those commands *in the current shell process, so they affect the environment of the current shell process*. Usually other shell script files you write are not *sourced*; instead, they are executed in a sub\\-shell (a separate instance or copy of `bash`), and they can't change anything in the environment of their parent shell (the main instance of `bash` that was started when you opened the new Terminal window).\n\nTo get a shell to source a script, you use the `source` command, which is built into the shell. A shortcut for the `source` command is `.` (yep, just a dot/period/full\\-stop character). In a previous version of this Answer, I used the `.` operator instead of the `source` command."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: On macOS, you've added an alias to your ~/.bashrc file, but it's not working when you open a new Terminal window.

It will subtract the lakes from your countries.\n\nLet's say your lakes are in another table called lakes and you've already stored your countries. You would do something like\n\n```\nUPDATE countries SET geom = ST_Difference(geom, \n       (SELECT ST_Union(l.geom) FROM lakes As l \n         WHERE ST_Intersects(l.geom, countries.geom) );\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS developer is working with a PostGIS database containing country borders stored as MULTIPOLYGON geometries.

This effectively creates holes in the country polygons where lakes exist.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ST_Intersection would only keep the areas where countries and lakes overlap, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nOption C is incorrect because ST_Union would combine the country and lake geometries, adding the lakes to the countries instead of creating holes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no ST_Subtract function in PostGIS. The correct function for this operation is ST_Difference.\n\nThe query first unions all intersecting lake geometries for each country using ST_Union and ST_Intersects, then subtracts this unified lake geometry from the country geometry using ST_Difference."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/11", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/367819", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/135288/"], "docs_id": 367819, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was wondering how do SDRs adjust their passband for a such a wide range of frequencies?\n\nThe normal RF chain is, passband RF filter \\-\\> Mixer \\-\\> IF or baseband\n\nSome SDRs can select their passband from being centered at 100khz to being centered at 3Ghz(with their IF or baseband range 20Mhz).\n\nDoes the SDR consist of hundreds of selectable RF bandpass filters or has someone come up with an adjustable one?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think many SDRs either have no filter or have a very wide filter at RF. Really, the main filtering required is at IF. And that can be a wide, fixed filter, followed up by narrower filters implemented with DSP. There is usually also some band switching to enable receiving inputs near our on the wrong side of the IF.\n\nConsider the USRP\\-2954 SDR (block diagram from [http://zone.ni.com/reference/en\\-XX/help/373380G\\-01/usrphelp/2954\\_block\\_diagram/](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/373380G-01/usrphelp/2954_block_diagram/)):\n\n[![USRP 2954 block diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZLjU.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZLjU.gif)\n\nThe frequency range is 10 MHz to 6 GHz. For 500 MHz to 6 GHz, a single conversion is used to translate to baseband. No tunable filters are required here, only fixed 80 MHz low pass filters between the mixer and the ADC. A fixed 500 MHz or so high pass filter to remove anything in the vicinity of the baseband might be a good idea to avoid aliasing, not sure why it's not there. For 10 MHz to 500 MHz, two conversions are used: one to convert up to 2\\.44 GHz, then one to bring that back down to baseband. Again, this requires only a few fixed filters. \n\nThe HackRF One is similar (block diagram from [http://www.dolstra.nl/Ham\\-radio/SDR\\_Tranceivers/HackRF%20One%20SDR/HackRF%20One%20SDR.htm](http://www.dolstra.nl/Ham-radio/SDR_Tranceivers/HackRF%20One%20SDR/HackRF%20One%20SDR.htm)):\n\n[![HackRF One block diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lgA7i.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lgA7i.png)\n\nIn this case, there are two image reject filters (one fixed high pass, one fixed low pass). Signals can be routed through one of those filters and a frequency converter or bypass the front end frequency conversion entirely. None of this requires tunable filters. The IF in this case is 2\\.3\\-2\\.7 GHz, converted to/from baseband with a MAX2837\\. \n\nAlso, if you really need an adjustable RF bandpass filter, they do exist, they just aren't cheap. And they have been around for quite a few years. YIG tuned filters can have a decently narrow bandwidth and can be tuned over several GHz. They are relatively common in RF test equipment that works at relatively high frequencies (10 GHz\\+)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which statement best describes the filtering approach used in many modern Software Defined Radios (SDRs) for handling a wide range of frequencies?\n\nA) SDRs typically use hundreds of selectable RF bandpass filters to cover different frequency ranges.\nB) Most SDRs employ a single, highly adjustable RF bandpass filter that can be tuned across the entire operating range.\nC) SDRs often use minimal or no filtering at RF, relying more on fixed wide filtering at IF and digital filtering in DSP.\nD) YIG-tuned filters are commonly used in SDRs to provide adjustable RF filtering across several GHz.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that many modern SDRs use minimal or no filtering at the RF stage, instead relying on fixed wide filters at the IF (Intermediate Frequency) stage, followed by narrower digital filtering implemented in DSP (Digital Signal Processing). This approach allows SDRs to cover a wide frequency range without the need for multiple selectable filters or complex adjustable RF filters. The examples of the USRP-2954 and HackRF One illustrate this design philosophy, using fixed filters and frequency conversion techniques rather than tunable RF filters. While adjustable filters like YIG-tuned filters exist, they are mentioned as being expensive and more common in high-frequency test equipment rather than typical SDRs."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/11/18", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/44495", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/12621/"], "docs_id": 44495, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using Magento 1\\.9\\.0\\.1\n\nWhere can i change the results section from the search results page to show only 1 column?\n\nNow it shows search results with class\\=\"col\\-lg\\-9 col\\-md\\-9 col\\-sm\\-9 col\\-xs\\-12\" and in the sidebar the layered nav (col\\-lg\\-3\\) \n\ni do not need the sidebar... what and where would i need to change do i need to do it in an xml file or phtml file?\n\nThanks\nCarlo\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\n<catalogsearch_result_index translate=\"label\">\n  <reference name=\"root\">\n    <action method=\"setTemplate\">\n      <template>page/1column.phtml</template> \n    </action>\n  </reference>\n</catalogsearch_result_index>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 1.9.0.1, you want to modify the search results page to display only one column without a sidebar.

This is important, as the meaning defines the conventions, if you wish to follow them.\n\nAs the naming specifications that [@Dean](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/66048#66052) referred to say, packages are a **hierarchical naming pattern**, which means that the most general distinction comes first.\n\nFor that, you should follow convention, which is:\n\n* If you are building **commercial software** use **com** (`.yourcompanyname`).\n* If you are building **[free/open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software)**, use **org** (`.yourorganizationname`).\n\n---\n\n*As a side note, I remember reading somewhere, though I can't find the source, that [Tim Berners\\-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) (creator of the [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)) said, if he were to create the specification over again, he would put the [TLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) (`.com`, `.org` etc.) first (mirroring software package conventions), as it is the highest level of the hierarchy.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In software development, particularly for languages like Java, C#, and ActionScript 3, what is the primary purpose of using \"com\" or \"org\" as the first part of a package name (e.g., com.foo.events.Bar or org.foo.controls.Baz)?\n\nA) To indicate whether the software is commercial or open-source\nB) To represent \"common\" or \"community\" for shared libraries\nC) To follow alphabetical ordering in package listings\nD) To differentiate between compiled and interpreted code\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. According to the documentation, \"com\" stands for commercial software, while \"org\" is used for free/open-source software. This naming convention provides a hierarchical structure where the most general distinction comes first. It's not about indicating common libraries (B) or alphabetical ordering (C).

The number of songs that they play on a given day has a Poisson\ndistribution, with an average of 5 songs per day. Regardless of how many songs\nthey will play that day, Helen and Joe always flip a coin at the start of each song, to decide who will play the solo on that song. If we know that Joe plays\nexactly 4 solos on a given day, then how many solos do we expect that Helen\nwill play on that same day?\n\nMy attempt:\nIf the average is $5$ songs a day and Joe performs $4$ solos on one day. I thought we should expect Helen to perform $1$ solo on the same day $(5\\-4\\=1\\)$\n\nBut The answer given to me is: $2\\.5$ solos we expect Helen to play\n\nMy question is why? What is the way of thinking that gives me $2\\.5$? Is it cause of the coin flip? so $5 \\\\cdot .5 \\= 2\\.5$? What does Joe's $4$ solos have to do with anything then?\n\nThank You for any help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While Matthew Pilling and tommik provide answers that show the mathematics of getting the answer, I will provide the intuition involved.\n\n1. We know that, on this specific day, Joe played 4 solos. This provides a minimum number of songs \\- specifically, there must have been at least 4 songs. Note that it is very possible for the Poisson distribution to produce 0 songs or 1 song. However, we have been given information that constrains the set of possible numbers of songs \\- it must be at least 4\\.\n2. We know that Joe played *exactly* 4 solos \\- this is a lot more likely if there are 8 songs (\\~27%) than if there are 4 songs (\\~6%). This changes the likelihoods of each of the possibilities, compared with the basic Poisson distribution, given this information.\n3. How many solos we expect Helen to have played can then be worked out from the new probabilities, which have incorporated the additional information (that Joe played 4 solos).\n\nTo see why the 50% information can't be directly used to conclude that Helen is expected to have played 4 solos as well, consider a slightly modified version of the problem. Rather than the number of songs following a Poisson distribution, we will assume that they follow a uniform distribution of between 1 and 7 songs.\n\nNow, we know that Joe played 4 solos. How many solos do we expect Helen to have played? Well, it can't be 4, because that would mean they may have played 8 songs, which can't have happened \\- the maximum is 7 songs.\n\nTo work out the correct answer, we turn to Bayes' Theorem, which is explicitly used in Matthew's answer, and is hidden by proportionality in tommik's answer. Think of the fact that Joe played 4 solos as a \"new piece of information\". Bayes' Theorem (at least by Bayesian thinking) lets you update your probabilities given the new information."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Helen and Joe play guitar together every day at lunchtime.

However, this doesn't account for the probabilistic nature of the scenario.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. It takes into account the Poisson distribution of the number of songs and the additional information about Joe's solos. The expected value is calculated using Bayes' Theorem, considering the probability of different numbers of songs given that Joe played 4 solos.\n\nC) This answer incorrectly assumes that Helen plays the same number of solos as Joe due to the 50/50 chance from the coin flip.

After all, **you search for a person with the same profile and the same skills, doing the same tasks**.\n\nStill, I noticed personally and often read that Indian developers have a different approach of a relation with a customer. When you ask them to do something which doesn't make any sense or will be overly expensive or has a high risk of breaking something, they will still do it, instead of \\[politely] explaining to you that you're stupid and don't know what you're really asking.\n\nSince you're a developer, it may not bother you too much. If I were you, I would still talk to them about this point and how they approach it, in other words if they understand that it's better to say \"No\" to their customer than to implement something substantially broken.\n\n---\n\nMore generally, when you search for a developer, try to determine following things:\n\n* **Does the person have the right technical skills?**\n\nThis is done by asking the right questions, and depends a lot of the specific job. It may be something basic, as \"What is the difference between stack and queue? Which one do you use to replace a recursion and how?\" to something very advanced in a specific language.\n\nAsking to write code is a good idea (see Joel Test), but may be difficult in an interview by phone. You will feel stupid staying at phone waiting for twenty minutes for a person to solve a problem, and it will stress the interviewed person. You also cannot know if the person is actually solving the problem or asking for help on Stack Overflow.\n* **What about communication skills?**\n\nPartially you get the idea by talking to the person, but this may be not enough. Often written skill is more important, and you may want to ask if the person has a blog, a high\\-rep account on Stack Exchange, etc.\n* **Is the candidate THE candidate you want?**\n\nThis one is the most difficult to answer, and the risk of making a mistake is high (in both ways).

While technical skills are important, the answer emphasizes that you should also assess communication skills and cultural fit. Specifically, it mentions evaluating how they handle customer relationships, particularly their willingness to pushback on problematic requests. The correct answer, C, captures this holistic approach of assessing both technical abilities and soft skills, including their approach to customer interactions.

Or Any idea how you could solve this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Concerning question 2, Yair Hayut's comment is exactly right, and this kind of situation is just the kind of situation that I had aimed to analyze with those results.\n\nThe basic fact is that if one performs forcing $\\\\mathbb{P}\\_0$ of size $\\\\delta$ followed by nontrivial strategically $\\\\leq\\\\delta$\\-closed forcing $\\\\mathbb{Q}$, then the extension $V\\\\subset V\\[g]\\[H]$ has the *$\\\\delta^\\+$\\-approximation* property, which means that any set $A\\\\in V\\[g]\\[H]$ with $A\\\\subset V$ and $A\\\\cap a\\\\in V$ whenever $a$ has size at most $\\\\delta$ in $V$, then $A$ is already in $V$. Thus, there can be in the extension no *fresh* subsets of a larger regular cardinal $\\\\alpha$, where $A\\\\subset\\\\alpha$ is *fresh* over $V$ if $A\\\\notin V$ but all initial segments of $A$ below $\\\\alpha$ are in $V$. \n\nYour iteration admits a closure point at the least inaccessible, and so it can add no fresh subsets above the least inaccessible. In particular, it adds no $V$\\-generic Cohen sets using $\\\\text{Add}(\\\\alpha,1\\)^V$, since this forcing would add a fresh subset of $\\\\alpha$.\n\nYou can find details in my paper *Joel David Hamkins*, [**Extensions with the approximation and cover properties have no new large cardinals**](http://dx.doi.org/10.4064/fm180-3-4), *Fund. Math.* **180** (2003\\), no. 3, 257\\-\\-277\\. see also [my blog](http://jdh.hamkins.org/approximation-and-cover-properties/). \n\nOne can use this idea to show that if you add a Cohen subset to $\\\\kappa$ and then to $\\\\lambda\\>\\\\kappa$, then you kill all supercompact cardinals between $\\\\kappa$ and $\\\\lambda$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a forcing iteration where we first add a Cohen subset to an inaccessible cardinal \u03ba, then perform a strategically \u2264\u03ba-closed forcing, and finally add a Cohen subset to a larger cardinal \u03bb > \u03ba. What can we conclude about the cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb in the resulting model?\n\nA) All cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb remain supercompact\nB) Only \u03ba remains supercompact, while all cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb lose their supercompactness\nC) All cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb lose their supercompactness, including \u03ba\nD) The supercompactness of cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb is preserved, but \u03ba loses its inaccessibility\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key insight comes from the approximation property discussed in the documentation. When we add a Cohen subset to \u03ba and then perform strategically \u2264\u03ba-closed forcing, we create a closure point at \u03ba. This means the extension satisfies the \u03ba\u207a-approximation property. \n\nWhen we subsequently add a Cohen subset to \u03bb > \u03ba, we're adding a fresh subset above this closure point. According to the documentation, this process \"kills all supercompact cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb\". \n\nFurthermore, \u03ba itself loses its supercompactness (and even its inaccessibility) due to the addition of a Cohen subset. Therefore, all cardinals between \u03ba and \u03bb, including \u03ba, lose their supercompactness in this forcing iteration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because supercompactness is not preserved. Option B is wrong because \u03ba also loses its supercompactness. Option D is incorrect because \u03ba loses more than just its inaccessibility - it loses its supercompactness as well."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/321090", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/91317/"], "docs_id": 321090, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have install magento2 in AWS ec2 behind a load balancer .

We have a script that is used to transfer files between two SCO Unix systems. The script has been rock solid for years. Recently the firewall unit at one location failed and was replaced. We can open a VPN tunnel, FTP works and we can transfer files, but the script is getting stuck at the point where it deletes a file.  \n\nThe script writes a local file to identify that an FTP transfer is in progress (called a \"lockfile\"). The file uses the PID in the file name so the script can identify it. Then after the FTP transfer the script deletes the file as a clear indicator that the transfer process is complete.\nThe FTP transfer completes \\- files are transferred. A message is echoed on the screen to say that the FTP session is closed.\nBut the script stalls at the point where it removes the lockfile. \n\nAlso, the script supports deleting \"stale\" lock files but it cannot do that any more either.\n\nNot sure how the firewall on the target system would impact the local system, but that's the symptom. \n\nWe do not currently have a sys admin.

Astronomers back then thought that GRBs were the direct result of anti\\-matter\\-matter collisions (between anti\\-matter *comets* and matter comets) that were taking place in the [Oort cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud). \n\n[This 1996 article by Chuck Dermer](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/proceeding/aipcp/10.1063/1.51650) (paywall), titled *Gamma\\-ray bursts from comet\\-antimatter comet collisions in the Oort cloud*, discusses the details of how it could be possible.\n\nUnfortunately, that theory has since been thrown out the window for a few reasons, but the most important one was the [connection of supernovae and GRBs](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203391) (arXiv link). The current thinking is that *short\\-duration* GRBs are caused two neutron stars or two black holes that are merging (spiraling around each other) while *long\\-duration* GRBs are caused by hypernovae (super\\-luminous supernovae) that produce black holes (which causes the explosion to go outwards in the commonly\\-shown jet emission, rather than a spherical explosion)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the historical development and current understanding of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)?\n\nA) GRBs are primarily caused by anti-matter-matter collisions in the Oort cloud, a theory that remains widely accepted today.\n\nB) Short-duration GRBs are caused by supernova explosions, while long-duration GRBs result from merging neutron stars.\n\nC) The connection between supernovae and GRBs led to the rejection of the anti-matter comet collision theory and the development of new explanations for GRB origins.\n\nD) Astronomers in the 1990s correctly identified that all GRBs are caused by merging black holes, a theory that has remained unchanged.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the historical progression of our understanding of GRBs. The documentation mentions that in the 1990s, there was a theory that GRBs were caused by anti-matter-matter collisions in the Oort cloud. However, this theory was later discarded, primarily due to the discovery of the connection between supernovae and GRBs. This led to the development of new explanations, including the current understanding that short-duration GRBs are caused by merging neutron stars or black holes, while long-duration GRBs are associated with hypernovae.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the anti-matter collision theory is no longer widely accepted. Option B incorrectly reverses the causes of short and long-duration GRBs.

one:\n\n```\nATTRS{serial}==\"736613021813\"\n\n```\n\nThe `udev(7)` man page says:\n\n> If multiple keys that match a parent device are specified in a single rule, all these keys must match at one and the same parent device.\n\nThe attribute that makes the interfaces distinguishable is in the parent block, and the attribute that makes the cameras distinguishable is in the grandparent block.\nSo, you'll have to use multiple rule lines.\n\nFor each camera, there should be a group of rules like this:\n\n```\nSUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", ATTRS{serial}!=\"736613021813\", GOTO=\"not_first_camera\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", KERNEL==\"video*\", ATTRS{interface}==\"Intel(R) RealSense(TM) 415 Depth\", SYMLINK+=\"cam1_depth\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", KERNEL==\"video*\", ATTRS{interface}==\"Intel(R) RealSense(TM) 415 RGB\", SYMLINK+=\"cam1_rgb\"\nLABEL=\"not_first_camera\"\n\n```\n\nThe first rule bypasses the two following rules if the camera serial number does not match. In this way, between the first rule and the LABEL associated with it, we can be sure of the identity of the camera we're talking about and can concentrate on telling the interfaces apart.\n\nEach block should have an unique `LABEL=` line and a `GOTO=` statement that matches the unique label. Of course you can name the `SYMLINK`s as you wish."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When creating udev rules for multiple Intel RealSense D415 cameras, which combination of attributes and rule structure is most appropriate for reliably differentiating between cameras and their interfaces?\n\nA) Use a single rule with KERNEL, SUBSYSTEM, and ATTRS{name} attributes\nB) Create separate rules for each camera using only the ATTRS{serial} attribute\nC) Use a block of rules for each camera, starting with a conditional GOTO based on ATTRS{serial}, followed by rules differentiating interfaces using ATTRS{interface}\nD) Rely solely on KERNEL and SUBSYSTEM attributes in a single rule for all cameras\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct approach because:\n1. It uses ATTRS{serial} to uniquely identify each camera, addressing the need to differentiate between multiple cameras.\n2. It employs a GOTO statement to create a block of rules specific to each camera, ensuring that rules for one camera don't interfere with others.\n3. Within each camera's block, it uses ATTRS{interface} to distinguish between the Depth and RGB interfaces of the camera.\n4. This structure allows for creating unique symlinks for each camera and interface combination, providing reliable and consistent device naming.\n\nOption A is insufficient as it doesn't account for multiple cameras or distinguish between interfaces. Option B doesn't address the need to differentiate between interfaces. Option D lacks the specificity needed to reliably identify and differentiate between multiple cameras and their interfaces."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/26", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42417", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/10635/"], "docs_id": 42417, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **This question led to a new package:**  \n> \n> [`currfile-abspath` (subpackage to `currfile`)](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/currfile)\n\nHow can I display the full path of the `tex` file that I compile?

The top answer in the StackExchange post strongly advises against hiding dryer ducts within walls and venting them through the roof. This practice can lead to several issues:\n\n1. Difficulty in cleaning: Inaccessible ducts are less likely to be cleaned regularly, leading to lint buildup.\n2. Fire hazard: Accumulated lint in uncleaned ducts can potentially catch fire.\n3. Moisture problems: If the ducting develops openings, it can release moist air into the wall cavity, potentially attracting pests like termites.\n4.

Option B is explicitly advised against in the post due to the reasons mentioned above.

While it shouldn't be punitive in theory, sometimes it is \\- especially when something is clearly out of scope. On main sites, question downvotes often indicate a lack of research, information, or something that simply isn't within the scope of the site. We often edit questions for new users if the issues are minor, and comment on how to make things better. Sometimes something simply isn't in scope\n\nUsing the *appropriate* tags is important because it makes it easier to find specific sorts of questions. We clear out bad tags cause its noise. As a new user, if you really *need* a tag, and can make a case for it, it'll be added. However [reputation](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/reputation \"show questions tagged 'reputation'\") [point](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/point \"show questions tagged 'point'\") [system](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/system \"show questions tagged 'system'\") [is](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/is \"show questions tagged 'is'\") [dumb](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/dumb \"show questions tagged 'dumb'\") [stupid](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/stupid \"show questions tagged 'stupid'\") [pointless](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/pointless \"show questions tagged 'pointless'\") [ridiculous](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/ridiculous \"show questions tagged 'ridiculous'\") are textbook invalid tags \\- tags are like salt. A little goes a long way, too much causes high blood pressures. [discussion](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/discussion \"show questions tagged 'discussion'\") will do nicely. This is PRECISELY why you need reputation to post tags.\n\nThe problem with your *original* question is really that its essentially a broad purchase recommendation. While there's workarounds, there's no real way to post a proper, universal answer to handle 'why is my computer slow'. we *typically* handle this on chat, but yes, it kind of sucks that you can't do that, but once again, that low barrier of entry keeps spammers and all but the most persistent trolls out. \n\nHandling a high traffic site isn't easy. We have a fairly large team of moderators, we have community mods, and people *still* do things like use tags we've asked them not to use. \n\nGetting rep isn't hard. As I pointed out, you need ONE quality answer, or a good question. I've always pointed folk at ESR's [asking questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) or you could do what I did and look around. (I've asked bad questions. It isn't the end of the world).\n\nThe reputation system lets us do a few things. Firstly, its our first line of defence against spammers. Secondly, it ensures quality to an extent.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the Chern classes of E and the metric h?\n\nA) The first Chern class c\u2081(E) can always be expressed as the de Rham class of (i/\u03c0)\u2202\u2202\u0304log det h, regardless of the singularities of h.\n\nB) For any singular Hermitian metric h on E, all Chern classes c\u2081(E), ..., c\u1d63(E) can be directly computed from the curvature form of h using the characteristic polynomial formula.\n\nC) If h is negatively curved in the sense of Griffiths and det h \u2260 0, then log det h \u2208 L\u00b9\u2097\u2092\ud835\udcb8(X) and the first Chern class c\u2081(E) can be represented by the current (i/2\u03c0)\u2202\u2202\u0304log det h.\n\nD) The Poincar\u00e9-Lelong formula dd\ud835\udcb8 log ||S|| = [Z_S] - (\u221a(-1)/2\u03c0)\u0398(E) holds for any singular Hermitian metric h on E and any holomorphic section S.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the properties of singular Hermitian metrics that are negatively curved in the Griffiths sense. When h is negatively curved and det h \u2260 0, log det h is plurisubharmonic and locally integrable. This allows the first Chern class to be represented by the current (i/2\u03c0)\u2202\u2202\u0304log det h.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the result for line bundles to higher-rank bundles without considering the complexities of singular metrics in higher ranks.\n\nOption B is false because the characteristic polynomial formula for Chern classes assumes a smooth metric and well-defined curvature form, which may not exist for singular metrics on higher-rank bundles.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Poincar\u00e9-Lelong formula in this form is typically stated for smooth metrics, and its extension to singular metrics requires careful consideration of the singularities and may not hold generally."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/29", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/95317", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/33518/"], "docs_id": 95317, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using SMTP pro extension for managing emails. \n\nCustomer email confirmation was working fine previously, although no configuration was changed, i am having issue with order email confirmation.

This suggests that there is already a connection between the neutral (black) wire and the metal ceiling somewhere in the system. The most likely explanation is that the black wire's insulation has degraded or been damaged, allowing it to make contact with the conductive metal ceiling. This creates a path for current to flow directly between the live (red) and neutral (via the ceiling), causing a short circuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if the red wire were touching the ceiling, it would cause a short circuit on its own, without needing to touch it to the ceiling manually.\n\nOption C is unlikely because earth wires are designed to be in contact with conductive surfaces and wouldn't typically cause a short circuit in this manner.\n\nOption D is ruled out because the problem persists even after the light fixture has been removed."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/25", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/156411", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/13331/"], "docs_id": 156411, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can we call a static block in Magento 2 in a page.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Windows supports having many network interfaces, for example you could have both wireless and wired Ethernet on the same laptop. Each of those would be its own network adapter. It's also possible to have more than one of each type, say two Ethernet ports, which might be useful on a server.\n\nNormally you would only connect one at a time. Say you are connected to wireless, you probably would not also connect your wired interface by plugging a cable in. In this case, you would see `Media disconnected` under the `Ethernet adapter Local Area Network`, as you do see in your screenshot.\n\nIn addition to these hardware interfaces, there are also software interfaces. One common use for these type is with VPN software. These interfaces do not exist in hardware, but you can send data to them just the same, and what happens is defined by the software. A VPN would take the data and encrypt it before sending it to another interface.\n\nYour `192.168.56.1` interface is named `VirtualBox` which leads me to conclude it is a software interface set up by the `VirtualBox` software, for the purpose of creating a \"fake\" network between your \"real\" computer and the \"virtual\" computer. This means your \"real\" computer has a software interface with the address of `192.168.56.1` and the \"virtual\" computer has some other address on that \"fake\" network, probably `192.168.56.2` or something.\n\nThe FTP server ties into all this because it \"listens\" for connections on every interface you have at the same time. You have an IP address on a wireless network as `192.168.1.3` and you also have an IP address on a `VirtualBox` software network as `192.168.56.1`. The FTP server does not know/care which one is best; it just listens on both of them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between network interfaces and IP addresses in Windows, as illustrated by the \"ipconfig\" command output?\n\nA) Each physical network adapter can only have one IP address associated with it at a time.\n\nB) Software interfaces, such as those created by VirtualBox, cannot coexist with physical network adapters.\n\nC) The presence of multiple IP addresses in the \"ipconfig\" output always indicates multiple physical network adapters.\n\nD) A single Windows machine can have multiple IP addresses across various physical and virtual network interfaces simultaneously.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As explained in the documentation, Windows supports having multiple network interfaces, both physical (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi) and virtual (like those created by VirtualBox or VPN software). Each of these interfaces can have its own IP address, and they can coexist on the same machine. This is why the \"ipconfig\" command often shows multiple entries, including addresses for physical adapters, virtual adapters, and even disconnected adapters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a single physical adapter can have multiple IP addresses in some configurations.\n\nOption B is false because software interfaces can and do coexist with physical adapters, as seen in the example with the VirtualBox interface.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the presence of multiple IP addresses doesn't necessarily indicate multiple physical adapters; some could be virtual or software interfaces."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/26", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258754", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/150109/"], "docs_id": 258754, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I drag/move a window so that its top is above the screen?\n\nI want to be able to resize a window taller vertically than the screen itself, and then take a picture of the window, but I don't care about getting the window's title bar in the picture, only the content of the window, which is actually smaller than the screen but cannot all be viewed at once because of the title bar making the window's size too large.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Enter Full Screen does exactly that.

By dragging the window to the bottom and stretching it upwards, you maximize the visible content. Using Cmd + Shift + 4 followed by spacebar allows you to capture the specific window, and clicking on it will capture the entire window content, even parts extending beyond the visible screen area.

So, theoretically there are problem domains where linear regression works best. My question is rather this: can you give a real life problem domain where linear regression is known to perform (has higher accuracy in prediction) better than more sophisticated methods like neural networks, support vector machines, or random forests.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Say that you are predicting sells of some products given their price and some other variables. Your data is noisy, since you have many different products and there are many factors that you are not able to account. You may assume that there is some kind of effect that may be *approximated* with linear function (better price leads to better sells). You need this model for doing future predictions of *different* products, sold in *different* part of the year, so possibly by *different* clients etc., so basically lot's of things may change.\n\nSurely you could use many different methods for approaching this problem, but in many cases linear regression would be something that you would start and end with. There are many reasons for this, e.g.\n\n* more complicated models would possibly overfit, simple model would be more robust, this is important if you care about out\\-of\\-sample errors (and you care),\n* by design it would give you the results that are \"on average\" correct, if you have products that sell very well and very bad, then it possibly wouldn't give you the exactly correct results for them, but \"in total\" it should give you the balanced solution,\n* regression will work out\\-of\\-the\\-box for many cases,\n* it will work even for larger sets of the data and it would be fast,\n* it is easily interpretable, so it would be easy to explain to the management what is your model and how did it predict what it did, this is something that you cannot say about many of the machine learning models, etc.\n\nFinally, there is many different measures of \"accuracy\" for predictions, different models would aim at minimizing different loss functions.

Robustness: In a noisy dataset with many changing factors, linear regression is less likely to overfit compared to more complex models, making it more robust for out-of-sample predictions.\n\n2. Interpretability: The results of linear regression are easily explainable to management, showing how each factor influences sales predictions.\n\n3. Generalization: Linear regression provides results that are \"on average\" correct, which is beneficial when dealing with a diverse range of products and conditions.\n\n4. Efficiency: It works well with large datasets and is computationally fast.\n\n5. Simplicity: Linear regression works \"out-of-the-box\" for many cases without requiring extensive tuning.\n\n6.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the installation of an expansion tank in a domestic water system?\n\nA) The expansion tank should always be installed on the hot water side of the water heater to accommodate expanding heated water.\n\nB) Expansion tanks are only necessary if specifically required by local building codes and have no other practical purpose.\n\nC) The expansion tank should be installed on the cold water feed to the water heater, after the shutoff valve, to manage pressure from water expansion.\n\nD) Expansion tanks are primarily used to increase water pressure and should be installed at the main water entry point to the house.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, when an expansion tank is required, it should be installed on the cold water feed to the water heater, after the shutoff valve. This location allows the tank to manage the increased pressure caused by water expansion when heated. Answer A is incorrect because the tank should be on the cold side, not the hot side. Answer B is partially true but incomplete, as expansion tanks serve important functions beyond just meeting code requirements, such as preventing excessive pressure. Answer D misunderstands the primary purpose of expansion tanks, which is to manage pressure from thermal expansion, not to increase overall water pressure."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/06", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/11071", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/886/"], "docs_id": 11071, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found this statement, \n\n> The paper presents an automatic approach ***to reconstruction*** of 3D objects from point cloud data.\n\nBut I feel like this is wrong as I learned with to \"should be infinitive\". Now I am confused. Can anyone clarify this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You should consider the sentence as:\n\n> The paper approaches to (**reconstruction of 3D objects**) from point cloud data.\n\nHere the preposition \"to\" is referring to the whole part i.e. \"reconstruction of 3D objects\".\n\nIf the verb form of \"reconstruction\" i.e. \"reconstruct\" had been used, it could have been written as:\n\n> The paper approaches to **reconstruct** the 3D objects from point cloud data.\n\nHere the \"to\" is used for \"reconstruct\" only.\n\nNote that, it is also possible to rewrite the sentence as:\n\n> The paper approaches to (**reconstructing the 3D objects**) from point cloud data.\n\n**EDIT**\\- Sorry, I mistook \"approach\" as verb here which it isn't. StoneyB pointed out the error, thanks to him! \"Approach\" is acting as a noun here. So it needs the preposition \"to\" after it. So, in this particular case, it isnt being used as infinitive. I am changing the examples as per usage of \"approach\" as a verb.\n\nAs for your example, you provided here, like I said in the last paragraph, \"to\" is acting because the noun needs its complement to be headed with the preposition to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sentences correctly uses the preposition \"to\" with the noun \"approach\" in the context of describing a paper's methodology?\n\nA) The paper presents an automatic approach for reconstruction of 3D objects from point cloud data.\nB) The paper presents an automatic approach to reconstruct 3D objects from point cloud data.\nC) The paper presents an automatic approach to reconstruction of 3D objects from point cloud data.\nD) The paper presents an automatic approach of reconstruction of 3D objects from point cloud data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct usage is \"approach to reconstruction\" because:\n\n1. \"Approach\" is being used as a noun in this sentence, not a verb.\n2. When \"approach\" is used as a noun, it is typically followed by the preposition \"to\" and a noun or gerund.\n3. \"Reconstruction\" is a noun in this context, not a verb.\n4. The phrase \"to reconstruction\" serves as the complement of the noun \"approach.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses \"for\" instead of \"to.\"\nOption B is incorrect because it uses the infinitive \"to reconstruct\" instead of the noun \"reconstruction.\"\nOption D is incorrect because it uses \"of\" instead of \"to.\"\n\nThe correct structure maintains the noun form \"reconstruction\" and uses the appropriate preposition \"to\" following the noun \"approach.\""}}
