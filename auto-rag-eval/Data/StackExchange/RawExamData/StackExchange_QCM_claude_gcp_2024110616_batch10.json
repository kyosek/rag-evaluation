Both of these pictures are of 5% carbon film resistors.\n\nWhat's the difference between them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note that power dissipation is not the only feature which may differ \\- see below.\n\nYou can tell very little with certainty by looking at resistors externally.  \n\n Knowing the manufacturer is liable to tell you far more than appearance does.  \n\n While I am almost always in agreement with Wouter, and do not differ very substantially on this occasion, I note that in some cases small resistors from a given manufacturer can have larger dissipations than those of larger resistors from the same manufacturer.\n\nAn excellent example are the superb SFR16 resistors (originally made by Philips and subsequently sold on several times) and their companion SFR25 resistors.\n\nThe combined [SFR16 / SFR25 datasheet here](ftp://ftp.ehu.es/cidira/dptos/depjt/DataBook/Discretos/Resistencias/Resistencia.pdf) shows that an SFR16 resistor is rated at 25% more dissipation than an SFR25 but is only about 50% of the length and 80% of the diameter.  \n\n When placed side by side the SFR16 appears tiny compared to an SFR 25, having only about 33% of the volume. \n\nSome other versions of the SRF16 had datasheets that advised up to 0\\.6W dissipation. (Note that the SFR25H in the above datasheet with the same dimensions as the SFR25 has 0\\.5 W dissipation).\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mH6wk.jpg)\n\n**Why, then, use an SFR25 ever?**  \n\n The SFR25 compared to an SFr16 has superior temperature coefficient, 250V compared to 200V maximum voltage rating and much superior noise characteristics in some ranges."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about resistors, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An electronics engineer is designing a circuit for a space-constrained device that requires a resistor with high power dissipation, low noise, and stability across a wide temperature range. Given the information about SFR16 and SFR25 resistors, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The SFR16 resistor is the best choice due to its higher power dissipation rating in a smaller package.\nB) The SFR25 resistor is ideal because it offers the best balance of power handling, noise characteristics, and temperature stability.\nC) Physical size is the most reliable indicator of a resistor's power handling capacity, so the larger resistor should always be chosen.\nD) The engineer should select the SFR16 for its superior voltage rating and use multiple resistors in parallel to achieve the desired noise characteristics.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, integrating them into a real-world scenario. The correct answer, B, is based on the following key points:\n\n1. While the SFR16 has higher power dissipation in a smaller package (0.5W or even 0.6W compared to 0.4W for the SFR25), the question emphasizes other critical factors beyond just power handling.\n\n2. The documentation states that the SFR25 has \"superior temperature coefficient,\" which addresses the requirement for stability across a wide temperature range.\n\n3. The SFR25 is noted to have \"much superior noise characteristics in some ranges,\" meeting the low noise requirement.\n\n4. Although not explicitly stated in the question, the SFR25 also has a higher voltage rating (250V vs. 200V), which could be beneficial in certain applications.\n\nOption A is a tempting distractor because it focuses on the impressive power handling of the smaller SFR16, but it ignores the other critical requirements. Option C is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that size is not always indicative of power handling capacity. Option D combines correct information about the SFR16's voltage rating with an impractical solution for noise reduction, making it a plausible but incorrect choice.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex technical information, apply it to a practical scenario, and make a decision based on multiple factors rather than a single specification."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/12", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2777458", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/483682/"], "docs_id": 2777458, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The book tells me to use the following integral,\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int\\_{c\\-i \\\\infty}^{c\\+i\\\\infty}y^s\\\\frac{ds}{s}\\=\n\\\\begin{cases}\n0\\\\quad\\&\\\\text{if }0\\<y\\<1,\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{1}{2}\\&\\\\text{if }y\\=1,\\\\\\\\\n1\\&\\\\text{if }y\\>1,\n\\\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $c\\>0$. I don't need to prove this but I wanted to make sense of this integral. Here's my (pseudo)proof for the first case.\n\nConsider a rectangular path consisting of $c\\+iT$, $c\\-iT$, $c\\+S\\-IT$ and $c\\+S\\+IT$ for some $T,S\\>0$. Call each path, starting from $c\\+iT$, $C\\_1,C\\_2,C\\_3$ and $C\\_4$ respectively \\- so $C\\_1$ and $C\\_3$ are two vertical paths and the other two are horizontal paths. If we integrate $\\\\frac{y^s}{s}$ over this rectangle, the result is 0 since there is no pole or zero inside. As $S,T\\\\to\\\\infty$, integrals along $C\\_2,C\\_3,C\\_4$ vanish since $\\\\left\\|\\\\frac{y^s}{s}\\\\right\\|\\\\to0$. Therefore, integral along $C\\_1$ is also 0 as $S,T\\\\to\\\\infty$.\n\nNow, I know I can use pretty much the same proof for $y\\>1$ case just by taking a rectangle extending to the left this time. However, I'm having a little bit if of difficulty to prove the case $y\\=1$ Can anyone help me? (Also, it'd be great if someone can tell me my proof is right)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When $y\\=1$ you just have $\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\left. \\\\ln(s) \\\\right \\|\\_{c\\-i\\\\infty}^{c\\+i\\\\infty}$. In the sense of Cauchy principal value at least, this evaluation is just $\\\\pi i$ giving an overall result of $1/2$.

The correct answer is B because the integral exhibits a step function behavior:\n\n1. For 0 < y < 1, the integral evaluates to 0.\n2. For y = 1, the integral evaluates to 1/2.\n3. For y > 1, the integral evaluates to 1.\n\nThis behavior is not continuous but rather a step function with three distinct values. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the different values when y < 1 and y = 1. Option C is wrong because the integral doesn't diverge for y \u2264 1; it has finite values. Option D is incorrect as it describes a continuous increase, which doesn't match the step function behavior.\n\nThe question requires analysis of the given information and integration of multiple concepts, including complex integration, parameter-dependent integrals, and step functions.

The correct answer, B, offers the most efficient and appropriate combination of tools for the given task:\n\n1. Buffer (water source): This replaces the need for Create Ellipse or Multiple Ring Buffer, as we're dealing with a simple distance from water sources.\n2.

Intersect (vegetation): This step is analogous to the final step in the original question, where we find the intersection of two polygonal features.\n4. Clip (to study area): This final step ensures the result is constrained to the area of interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses unnecessary complexity with Create Ellipse and Multiple Ring Buffer when a simple Buffer would suffice.

Given the code provided and the error message, what is the most likely cause of this issue and the appropriate solution?\n\nA) The di.xml file is incorrectly configured; change the preference type to \"Vendor\\Module\\Model\\Product\\Url\\Interceptor\"\nB) The custom Url class is missing essential dependencies; add @api annotation to the class declaration\nC) The custom Url class is not extending the correct parent class; change it to extend Magento\\Catalog\\Model\\Product\\Url\nD) The module's setup:upgrade command wasn't run; execute bin/magento setup:upgrade and clear the cache\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the error is that the custom Url class is extending \\Magento\\Framework\\DataObject instead of the original Magento\\Catalog\\Model\\Product\\Url class. This causes a type mismatch when Magento tries to create an instance of the class, leading to the \"Type Error\" with the Interceptor.\n\nThe correct approach is to extend the original class:\n\nclass Url extends \\Magento\\Catalog\\Model\\Product\\Url\n\nThis ensures that the custom class maintains the same interface and basic functionality as the original, while allowing for specific method overrides. The error message mentioning \"Interceptor\" is a clue that Magento's dependency injection system is involved, which expects the overridden class to be of the same type as the original.\n\nOptions A and B are distractors based on common Magento development concepts but don't address the core issue.

This option best aligns with the description provided in the StackExchange post while also adding depth to the character's personality. The post describes a character who is \"very routine, and organized,\" which \"manifests more as he's responsible and less as stubborn inflexibility.\" This indicates a sense of reliability without being overly rigid.\n\nThe phrase \"his yes means yes and his no means no\" suggests steadfastness and commitment to promises, which is captured in the \"steadfast dependability\" part of the answer.

In this context, it suggests that the company is setting its own ethical standards in each country, potentially disregarding universal ethical norms or international standards of corporate conduct.\n\nWhile \"Each to his own\" (option A) does suggest tolerance for differences, it typically applies to personal preferences or harmless choices, not to ethical standards in a corporate context. It doesn't capture the potential problem of a company creating its own ethical framework without accountability.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the two idioms are not equivalent in this context. \"Each to his own\" is more neutral and doesn't imply the same level of autonomy or potential disregard for external standards as \"a law unto themselves.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because the scenario does present a situation where at least one of the idioms (specifically, \"a law unto themselves\") is applicable.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the idioms' meanings, application to a real-world corporate ethics scenario, and critical thinking about the implications of language choice in justifying business practices."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/30", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1991477", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/367636/"], "docs_id": 1991477, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The statement has values of $x$ and $y$ as positive integers: $$\\\\sqrt{x} \\- \\\\sqrt{11} \\= \\\\sqrt{y}$$\n\nI have to find the maximum possible values of $\\\\frac{x}{y}$, this what I have done so far:\n\n$$x \\= (\\\\sqrt{y} \\+ \\\\sqrt{11})^2$$\n$$y \\= (\\\\sqrt{x} \\- \\\\sqrt{11})^2$$\n\ntherefore: $$\\\\frac{x}{y} \\= \\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{y} \\+ \\\\sqrt{11})^2}{(\\\\sqrt{x} \\- \\\\sqrt{11})^2}$$\n...\n$$\\\\frac{x}{y} \\= \\\\frac{y \\+ 11 \\+ 2\\\\sqrt{y}\\\\sqrt{11}}{x \\+ 11 \\- 2\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\sqrt{11}} \\= \\\\frac{y\\+\\\\sqrt{y}}{x\\-\\\\sqrt{x}} \\+ 1$$\n\nand from here I'm not sure what to do...\n(Again better title suggestions are also welcome)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $f$ is not holomorphic and not even meromorphic because $z \\\\mapsto \\\\bar z$ is not differentiable anywhere:\n\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\bar z \\- \\\\bar 0}{z \\- 0} \\= \\\\frac{(x\\-iy)^2}{x^2 \\+ y^2} \\= \\\\begin{cases} \\-i, \\\\text{ on the path $y\\=x$} \\\\\\\\ i, \\\\text{ on the path $y \\= \\-x$} \\\\end{cases}$$\n\nthe same can be done for any other point.\n\nSo you can't apply Cauchy's theorem or the Residue theorem.

The original equation \u221ax - \u221a11 = \u221ay implies that x > 11 and y < x.\n\n2. The derived equation x/y = (y+\u221ay)/(x-\u221ax) + 1 shows that x/y is always greater than 1.\n\n3. To maximize x/y, we need to maximize (y+\u221ay)/(x-\u221ax).\n\n4. Observe that y is closer to 11 than x is, as \u221ax = \u221ay + \u221a11.\n\n5. The closer y is to 11, the smaller the difference between x and y, which tends to increase the ratio x/y.\n\n6.

Now I have a new confusion matrix:\n\n```\n\n+---+------+------+------+\n|   |  S   |  B   |  U   |\n+---+------+------+------+\n| S | 0.9  | 0.02 | 0.08 |\n| B | 0.05 | 0.75 | 0.2  |\n+---+------+------+------+\n\n```\n\nand when I give it the same 20/80 split, I get\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\.22 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.604 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.176\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow to estimate the true signal and background fractions, I could perform e.g. a $\\\\chi^2$ minimization of the different weights in the confusion matrix to my test output. I.e. minimize $\\|\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}\\|^2$ in\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\mathbf{M\\_c} \\\\begin{pmatrix} S\\_1 \\\\\\\\ B\\_1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\vec{\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}}\n$$\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{M\\_c}$ is the confusion matrix (transposed).\n\nImprovement \\#3\n---------------\n\nFor any sample I give to the classifier, I get a score that tells me the probability that the sample is signal. Using my training data (or better, a different, independent set of training data), I can build PDFs for the score distribution separately for signal and background events. When I want to evaluate a test dataset, I get the distribution of scores from the classifier and fit that to the weighted sum of my signal and background PDFs, and the resulting weights give me the fraction of signal and background in the test dataset.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIs this sort of approach standard, and where can I find more information?  \n\nIf it's not already standard, are these approaches valid, and likely to add anything useful in a real\\-world scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The fact that your first graph merely oscillates between two values suggests to me that you are resetting the prior each time you perform an iteration. So what you are seeing in the graph is a sequence of posteriors, each of which only take one data point into account. That is not the correct method for iterative Bayesian updating. Remember that when you do iterative Bayesian updating, the prior for each new iteration is the *posterior* from the last iteration.

Normally the points are dynamic: that is, they are not given beforehand. (If they are available in advance, or in very large groups, some optimizations based on sorting them will be available.) Let *Q* be the number of query points and *P* be the number of polygon *vertices.*\n\n### Vector polygon data\n\n(1\\) **Few points, few polygon vertices *in toto***. Use a brute\\-force procedure, such as the classic [line\\-stabbing algorithm](http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2007/07/ultimate-point-in-polygon.html). For any decent method, the cost is O(P\\*Q), because it costs O(1\\) time to compare a point to a polygon edge and all such comparisons have to be made.\n\n(2\\) **Possibly many polygon vertices, but they are dynamic:** each time a point is used in the query, the polygons might all have changed. Again use a brute\\-force algorithm. The cost is still O(P\\*Q), which will be large because *P* will be large, but there's no helping that. If the changes are small or controlled (*e.g.*, the polygons are slightly changing shape or simply moving around slowly) you might be able to use a version of the next solution and find an efficient way to update the data structures as the polygons change. That would likely be a matter for original research.\n\n(3\\) **Many polygon vertices and static polygons** (that is, the polygon layer will rarely change). Precompute a data structure to support the search (which could be based on a [line sweep](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=lineSweep) or a [quadtree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) algorithm). The cost of precomputation for these algorithms is O(P\\*log(P)), but the cost of the queries becomes O(Q\\*log(P)), so the total cost is O((P\\+Q)\\*log(P)).\n\nSome improvements are available in **special cases**, such as \n\n(a) **All polygons are convex** ([preprocessing the polygons can be done more quickly](http://erich.realtimerendering.com/ptinpoly/)), \n\n(b) **All polygon interiors are disjoint**, in which case you can think of their union as being a single polygon (which allows for straightforward efficient algorithms, such as those based on triangulation, and \n\n(c) **Most polygons are not very tortuous**\\-\\-that is, they occupy large portions of their bounding boxes\\-\\-in which case you can do an initial test based on the bounding boxes only and then refine that solution. This is a popular optimization.\n\n(d) **The number of points is large.** Sorting them might improve the timing. For instance, when implementing a left\\-to\\-right line sweep point\\-in\\-polygon algorithm, you would sort the points on their first coordinate, allowing you to sweep over the points at the same time you sweep over the polygon edges. I'm not aware that such an optimization has been published. One that has been published, though, is to perform a [constrained triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation) of the union of all the points and polygon vertices: once that triangulation is complete, identifying the interior points should be quick. Computational cost will scale as O(Q\\*log(Q) \\+ (P\\+Q)\\*log(P\\+Q)).\n\n### Raster polygon data\n\nThis is incredibly easy: view the polygon layer as a binary indicator raster (1\\=inside a polygon, 0\\=outside). (This could require a lookup table to convert raster values to inside/outside indicators.) Each point probe now requires O(1\\) effort to index the raster cell and read its value. Total effort is O(Q).\n\n### In general\n\n**A nice *hybrid solution*** in the case of many static vector polygons (vector case 3 above) is initially to rasterize the polygons, perhaps even with a coarse resolution, this time distinguishing any cells intersecting any part of a polygon boundary (give them a value of 2, say). Using a raster probe (cost: O(1\\)) typically results in a definite answer (the point is known to be inside or outside), but occasionally results in an indefinite answer (the point falls in a cell through which at least one edge passes), in which case the more expensive O(log(P)) vector query is made. This method incurs some extra storage cost for the raster, but in many cases even a small raster (one MB will allow for a 2000 by 2000 raster that stores {0,1,2,null} values) can confer huge advantages in computational time. Asymptotically, the computational effort is the same as for a vector solution, but in practice it is O(Q \\+ P\\*log(P)) and possibly as low as O(Q\\+P) (achieved by using a very fine resolution for the raster and using brute\\-force methods for the very rare vector queries that have to be performed)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about determining polygons containing a given point, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A GIS application needs to efficiently determine which polygons contain each of 100,000 dynamically generated points.

What is the most efficient approach to solve this problem?\n\nA) Implement a brute-force point-in-polygon algorithm, checking each point against every polygon\nB) Create a quadtree data structure for the polygons and query it for each point\nC) Rasterize the polygons at a high resolution and use raster cell lookups for point queries\nD) Use a hybrid approach combining coarse rasterization with vector-based refinement\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing the problem characteristics and integrating multiple concepts from the documentation to determine the most efficient solution. Let's break down why D is the correct answer and why the other options are less optimal:\n\nD) The hybrid approach is the most efficient solution for this scenario. It combines the speed of raster lookups with the accuracy of vector-based queries when needed. The documentation states that this method \"incurs some extra storage cost for the raster, but in many cases even a small raster... can confer huge advantages in computational time.\" Given the large number of query points (100,000) and static polygons (10,000), this approach offers the best balance of speed and accuracy.\n\nA) While simple to implement, the brute-force approach would be highly inefficient for this scenario. With 100,000 points and 10,000 polygons, this would result in 1 billion point-in-polygon checks, making it computationally expensive.\n\nB) A quadtree structure would be more efficient than brute-force, falling under the \"precompute a data structure\" approach mentioned in the documentation. However, for complex polygons, this might still require significant refinement and wouldn't be as efficient as the hybrid approach for a large number of queries.\n\nC) Pure rasterization at a high resolution could be fast for queries but might require excessive memory and lose accuracy for complex polygon shapes. The documentation mentions rasterization as part of the hybrid approach but not as a standalone solution for complex polygons.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring analysis of the problem characteristics (many static polygons, many dynamic points) and understanding the trade-offs between different approaches discussed in the documentation."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/25", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/281124", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/448715/"], "docs_id": 281124, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Which is the appropriate Stack Exchange site where a question can be asked that is not seeking a solution to a problem, but, instead seeks an \"authorized\" or canonical answer? \n\nFor example, I want to know if it is safe or OK to run Microsoft disk defragmenter on a server.

However, concrete has high thermal mass: it takes a lot of energy to raise its temperature by 1 Kelvin. So even with heat going into it quickly, its temperature will rise slowly.\n\nThat's why concrete and earth walls are used in some passive solar designs: not necessarily for their insulation properties, but for their properties as a heat *buffer*: they can absorb a lot of heat for relatively low changes in their own temperature, and radiate it back out again. That gives you a wall surface with a fairly steady radiant temperature, which feels a lot more comfortable than a surface with a highly variable radiant temperature; and it gives you a huge buffer that allows you to store solar energy in the day and release it at night, thus giving you cooling during the day when you need it, and heating during the night when you need it."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An architect is designing a passive solar home in a region with hot days and cool nights.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the interplay between thermal conductivity and thermal mass in passive solar design.\n\nConcrete has a high thermal conductivity, which means heat energy travels through it relatively quickly.

Upload User Given Shapefile and show the Geometries on the map. You have several options here. You can follow the steps given in the [shapefile\\-js](https://github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js) project. This project is for Openlayers, so you'll have to modify it to convert the shapefile to ESRI JSON instead of GeoJSON. If you are willing to use ArcGIS Online, you can follow this sample: [Add shapefile](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jssamples/portal_addshapefile.html)\n2. Once you have the geometries/features in your web\\-map, then you will have to manually add them to your features service by using the [Add features Operation](http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/SDK/REST/fsadd.html) via an Ajax Request\n\nIf you do not need to show them on the map, you case is exactly opposite that of the example: [Clip And Ship](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//01540000035r000000).

You have to go to [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) to find something comparable, among sites with a similar age, but they're churning through something like seven times as many questions as here.\n\nOf course, it's quite possible that in terms of total amounts of reputation things are a bit more in line, but there I don't quite have the statistics chops to make a meaningful comparison. Either way, TeX.SE must either have (a) much more rep (hence also votes) to go around as other comparable sites, or (b) a much more skewed rep distribution curve. [This query](http://data.stackexchange.com/tex/query/206518/reputation-histogram-log-log-scale#graph) sort of vaguely supports the latter but then again you'd have to be quite careful with your comparisons.\n\nFor now, though, I want to ask this community what you think this says about this site.

It is [very easy](http://data.stackexchange.com/superuser/query/492368/total-upvotes-and-downvotes) to query for the total upvotes and downvotes in a site, and the data isn't at all unambiguous.

However, metrics like these do carry a nontrivial amount of information about each community and they are a reflection of the informal culture in the group.\n* Along similar lines, most of the comments saying 'it doesn't matter' and the like seem to come mostly from people whose experience on the SE network is here or on StackOverflow, and who may not be in a position to see just how crazy\\-high that rep board looks like.

In this case, one obvious possibility that I can see (especially as you don't securely clear the $password or $estring variables in the code you have shown) is that the contents of those might be written out to swap space. That would mean that they are committed to permanent storage at least for a while even not in the presence of an active attacker. This can be largely mitigated by either disabling swap entirely, or running swap encrypted with a random encryption key, which makes the swap inaccessible after a reboot (because the decryption key needed to make sense of it is lost when the system RAM is cleared).\n\nI would *imagine* that 7zip is well\\-behaved enough to clear out the password from its command line quickly and then further from its internal variables as soon as it is no longer needed, but things like expanded key schedules might be kept for a longer period of time thus increasing the potential for them being swapped out. Those won't necessarily allow recovery of the password, but they may very well allow recovery of the plaintext from the encrypted archive. A simple `ps axw` issued at just the right moment will show someone who is logged in the password in plain text from the command line, but it isn't *stored* and the window of opportunity is small.\n\nWhen you send the e\\-mail, I presume that it contains the password in clear text form (or something that is easily derived into the corresponding plaintext, such as a Base64 encoded message body). **That e\\-mail almost certainly *will* be temporarily written to the system's mail queue**, which means that the password does end up on disk (unless you have the mail queue directory on a RAM disk, which besides the fact that the mail queue is supposed to be on persistent storage presents its own set of problems operationally). Especially if you are running a smarthost setup the queue file will likely be deleted very soon afterwards, but since it has been written to disk, \"the damage is done\" so to speak. Something like `strings /dev/sd?` on any server the mail passes through will probably recover the password to anyone who knows what to look for unless you take specific steps to mitigate this threat.\n\nOf course, e\\-mail in the first place isn't designed to be completely secure. The only way to have reasonable confidentiality assurances with e\\-mail over SMTP (even if you are using SMTP over SSL, or STARTTLS, *throughout the entire chain* of mail servers) is end\\-to\\-end encryption like S/MIME or OpenPGP.\n\n**TL;DR:** Your web application *probably* doesn't deliberately store anywhere the command including the password, or the password itself, but other components it relies on very well might during the course of normal operations."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A security auditor is reviewing a PHP web application that generates and emails passwords for encrypted archives.

The documentation emphasizes this point, stating \"That e-mail almost certainly will be temporarily written to the system's mail queue,\" and further notes that even if the queue file is deleted soon after, \"the damage is done.\" This makes it the most likely scenario for password recovery in the event of a server compromise, especially since an attacker could potentially recover the password using methods like `strings /dev/sd?` on any server the mail passes through.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario of a security audit, and tests critical thinking about the relative risks of different application behaviors."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/23", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/705643", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/218179/"], "docs_id": 705643, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to capture packets from other local machines on my Mac?

Here's why:\n\n1. Scalability: SQL databases are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making them well-suited for the 50 million records in this case.\n\n2. Performance: The GROUP BY operation can be optimized by the database engine, often using indexing and partitioning strategies for faster execution.\n\n3. Memory efficiency: Unlike the in-memory associative map (option B), the SQL approach doesn't require holding the entire dataset in memory, which could be problematic for large datasets.\n\n4. Simplicity and maintainability: The SQL query is concise and easy to understand, making it more maintainable than complex custom algorithms.\n\n5. Flexibility: SQL allows for easy modifications to the analysis, such as adding additional demographic factors or changing the uniqueness criteria.\n\n6. Built-in functionality: Aggregate functions and HAVING clauses in SQL are specifically designed for this type of analysis, reducing the need for custom code.\n\nWhile option C (sorting and single-pass processing) could be efficient, it requires additional steps and custom implementation. Option B (in-memory map) might work for smaller datasets but could face memory limitations with 50 million records. Option D (MapReduce) is likely overkill for this task and introduces unnecessary complexity unless the dataset is truly massive or distributed across multiple systems.\n\nThe SQL approach strikes the best balance between efficiency, scalability, and simplicity for this specific analysis task."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/30", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316546", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/10035/"], "docs_id": 316546, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Definable subsets of $\\\\mathbb N$ in the language of Presburger arithmetic are exactly the eventually periodic sets and quantifier free part corresponds to Integer Programming with linear inequalities and variations lead to mixed integer linear programming, convex integer programming with convex constraints.

The concise description is that every formula $\\\\phi(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ is in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ equivalent to a Boolean combination of formulas expressing\n$$\\\\tag1\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:\\\\psi(v\\_p(x\\_1\\),\\\\dots,v\\_p(x\\_k))\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge n,$$\nwhere $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, and $n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$.\n\nIn the special case of formulas in one variable with parameters that you are interested in, this boils down to the following: definable subsets are Boolean combinations of sets defined by\n\n* $v\\_q(x)\\=n$,\n* $v\\_q(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\=n\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\\\ge n,v\\_p(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n\nfor some $q\\\\in\\\\mathbb P$, $n,b\\\\in\\\\omega$, $0\\\\le a\\<m\\<\\\\omega$.\n\nThat all definable relations in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ are equivalent to Boolean combinations of (1\\) follows from the results of Mostowski \\[1]. I will sketch how to prove the other direction, that all sets of the form (1\\) are first\\-order definable.\n\nUsing $\\\\cdot$, we can define the divisibility, coprimeness, and primality predicates as\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}\nx\\\\mid y\\&\\\\iff\\\\exists z\\\\,(y\\=x\\\\cdot z),\\\\\\\\\nx\\\\perp y\\&\\\\iff\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\land z\\\\mid y\\\\to z\\=1\\),\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mr{Prime}(x)\\&\\\\iff x\\\\ne1\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\to z\\=1\\\\lor z\\=x).\n\\\\end{align\\*}$$\nThen, we can define the set of powers of a prime by\n$$\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\perp p\\\\to z\\\\perp x).$$\nFinally, we can define for a given $x$ and a prime $p$ the power of $p$ that appears in the factorization of $x$ by\n$$\\\\mr{Val}(p,x,y)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Power}(p,y)\\\\land\\\\exists z\\\\,(x\\=y\\\\cdot z\\\\land z\\\\perp p).$$\nNow, for each prime $p$, $(\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\},{\\\\cdot})$ is a model of Presburger arithmetic (which I assume to be formulated in a language with just a single binary function symbol $\\+$). Thus, if $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, let $\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ (with an extra free variable $p$) denote the formula of Skolem arithmetic obtained by replacing all occurrences of $\\+$ with $\\\\cdot$, and relativizing all quantifiers to $\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\}$. Then (1\\) is defined by the formula\n$$\\\\exists^{\\\\ge n}p\\\\,(\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\exists y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k\\\\,(\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_1,y\\_1\\)\\\\land\\\\dots\\\\land\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_k,y\\_k)\\\\land\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k))).$$\n\nEDIT: I defined $\\\\psi^p$ for formulas written in the language with $\\+$ only to keep the definition succinct, but in practice, it is more convenient to define it directly for a richer language: specifically, we may translate the constants $0$ and $1$ to $1$ and $p$, respectively, and $x\\\\le y$ to $x\\\\mid y$.\n\nTo put it differently, any Presburger formula $\\\\psi(\\\\vec y)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of integer inequalities $n\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}n\\_iy\\_i\\\\le m\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}m\\_iy\\_i$, and congruences $y\\_i\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$. We may translate the former to $p^n\\\\prod\\_{i\\<k}y\\_i^{n\\_i}\\\\mid p^m\\\\prod\\_{i\\<k}y\\_i^{m\\_i}$, and the latter to $\\\\exists z\\\\,(y\\_i\\=p^az^m)$.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n\\[1] Andrzej Mostowski, *On direct products of theories*, Journal of Symbolic Logic 17 (1952\\), no. 1, pp. 1\u201331\\."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Skolem arithmetic, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a new algorithm for analyzing number-theoretic properties.

What would that even mean, graphically and intuitively?\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Say you have a dataset with 2 features, $X$, and $Y$.\n\nCentering the features of this dataset would mean we make it so that the mean value of the new $X$ feature becomes $0$, and the mean value of the new $Y$ feature becomes $0$. \n\nIn other words, if we get a dataset where the $X$ and $Y$ feature\\-values are centered, that means that they're given in terms of the distance from the most average feature\\-values for that dataset. When $X$ is $0$ and $Y$ is $0$, that corresponds to the \"most average\" datapoint.\n\nNow, let's say we want to predict $Y$ based on $X$ by doing linear regression on this data\\-set. In other words, we are turning $Y$ into the label we want to predict, and $X$ into the single feature we're predicting it with. \n\nNow, what happens? If we don't center either of the random\\-variables, then our linear regression model will simply fit a line to the $Y\\_s$ based on the $X\\_s$. $$y\\=mx\\+b$$.\n\nThat's okay. However, in this case $\\+b$, the intercept, has absolutely no meaning. It's the label which our model predicts a datapoint would take when $X\\=0$. However, $X$ might correspond to a feature where equaling zero is absolutely senseless! For example, what if $X$ is the height of a newborn baby?\n\nBy centering $X$, the bias now has meaning. Since $X$ is centered, it now takes on a value of $0$ for its average value. That makes the bias, $\\+b$, equal to the $Y$ feature\\-value for the baby with \"the most average height!!!\" Pretty cool!\n\nNow, what if we center the $Y$ labels as well? What happens to the bias \\- what does it represent?\n\nFirst of all, notice what happens to the linear if we center the $Y$ labels. Centering the $Y$ labels means that we subtract the mean of $Y$ from each $y$ value, so that the value that was previously the mean.\n\nLet $X'$ be the centered feature, $Y$ be the uncentered label, and $Y'$ be the centered label.\n\nIf all we're doing is setting $Y'\\=Y\\-\\\\mu\\_y$, then our linear equation should go from...\n\n$$y\\=mx'\\+b$$\n\n...to...\n\n$y'\\=mx'\\+(b\\-\\\\mu\\_y)$\n\n...that is, all that should happen to our linear equation is that it should get shifted down by $\\\\mu\\_y$.\n\nSay that $Y$ corresponds to the weight of a newborn baby.\n\nBefore centering $Y$ and turning it into $Y'$, when $X'\\=0$ the linear equation told us what we should predict the weight of a newborn baby of average height to be. That was $b$.\n\nNow, when $X'\\=0$, we instead get $b\\-\\\\mu\\_y$. That is, we get the expected difference between the weight of a newborn baby of average height and the average weight of these babies!\n\nNow, for each value of $X'$, what we're getting is the expected difference between the weight of a baby whose height is $X'$ away from the average height and the weight of the baby with the average weight!"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation and guidelines, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is analyzing the relationship between a student's study time (X) and their exam score (Y) using linear regression.

The key to understanding this scenario lies in interpreting the meaning of centered variables and the intercept in a linear regression model.\n\nWhen both the predictor (X, study time) and response (Y, exam score) variables are centered, the intercept represents the predicted value of Y when X is at its mean value.

You probably don't have enough gate drive voltage. Did you even look at the datasheet for the transistor you are using? If you had, you would have seen at what gate voltage it is intended to run at. Something rated for 60 V and 110 A almost certainly requires 12 V or so on the gate to get to the rated RDSON.\n\nWith only partial gate drive of 3\\.3 or 5 V, the effective resistance of the FET is much higher. This causes it to dissipate enough power to heat up to the point of self\\-destruction.\n\n- You don't have a flyback diode across the motor. There should be a diode in reverse across the motor. This is reverse\\-biased and does nothing when the motor is running normally. However, when you turn the motor off, it provides a safe path for the inductive kickback current. Without the diode when you try to switch off the motor, its inductance makes whatever voltage it takes to keep the same current running in the immediate short term. That means abusing the FET to the point where it conducts anyway, even though it is driven to off. That's bad for the FET."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is troubleshooting a circuit where a 48V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino and a MOSFET (IRF3205), is failing.

The correct answer is A for the following reasons:\n\n1. Insufficient gate drive voltage: The Arduino typically operates at 3.3V or 5V, which is significantly lower than the optimal gate drive voltage for a high-power MOSFET like the IRF3205. The datasheet for this MOSFET likely specifies a higher gate voltage (around 10-12V) for optimal performance when handling high currents. With a lower gate voltage, the MOSFET's on-resistance (RDS(on)) is much higher, causing excessive heat generation.\n\n2. Lack of a flyback diode: The circuit diagram doesn't show a flyback (or freewheeling) diode across the motor. This is crucial for handling the inductive kickback when the motor is switched off. Without this diode, the voltage spike created by the motor's inductance can damage the MOSFET.\n\nThese two factors combined lead to significant stress on the MOSFET, causing it to overheat and eventually fail.

If so, which one would be recommended?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrical characteristics\n--------------------------\n\nYou must consider the maximum characteristics. This includes the maximum DC forward current the display can handle. Maximum reverse voltage should also be noted down as well. 60mA max for 7 segments and 30mA max for the DP.\n\nBy the looks of it, you should be running the 7 segments at 20mA and the DP LED at 10mA to be safe.\n\nForward voltage should also be taken into consideration. You should be powering this display from a 12 volt supply since the forward voltage **CAN BE** (Vf is not consistent as it varies at different currents, make show you don't blow up the LED by overestimating the forward voltage!!! Read below to see what I mean by overestimating since in the formula of determining the series resistor, the Vf deducts the supply voltage.) a whopping 7\\.8V (DP is 3\\.9V) where it can increase all the way to 10V (DP is 5V).\n\nNow lastly, it's using those values. You need these values in order to know what resistor to use. However it's not that simple. The forward voltage changes at different forward currents. Check the [datasheet](http://www.produktinfo.conrad.com/datenblaetter/1000000-1099999/001050584-da-01-en-LED_ANZEIGE_7_SEG__ROT_SC40_19SURKWA.pdf) and look at the graph that shows the relation between them.\n\nNow calculate on [here](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/led-resistor-calculator) and you get your resistor value.\n\nWould an Arduino Leonardo suffice?\n----------------------------------\n\nCurrently with your method, it will *just* work since the Leonardo has 20 pins capable of outputting IO and you would omit pin 13 which is already connected to an LED and 1 and 2 since they're connected to Tx and Rx. However you can shave some pins down. Since you're going to be lighting the LED's one by one at a fast rate to give the illusion that they're all on at once, you can shave the 9 pins for each segment display into 4, saving 5 pins. This means you'll have more space for other stuff. You don't have to do this though otherwise you would need a BCD (or 4bit binary) to decade decoder IC.\n\nNeed any driver IC's?\n---------------------\n\nYes and no. Since your arduino runs at 5V and you would be driving the LED display at a much higher voltage, you would need to drive them. You could use a whole lot of PNP transistors and resistors in series with each base in addition to the resistors in series with the LEDs to drive them, or supplement the individual transistors together with a PNP transistor array IC which makes things a lil bit more organised.\n\nAnd if you're shaving these 9 pins into 4, you would need a BCD to decimal decoder as you're driving with binary this way."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about building a 9-digit 7-segment LED display, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a 9-digit 7-segment LED display system using 4-inch displays and an Arduino Leonardo.

Which combination of factors is most likely causing these issues?\n\nA) Insufficient current-limiting resistors and lack of a driver IC\nB) Overestimated forward voltage and use of a BCD to decimal decoder\nC) Inadequate power supply and direct Arduino pin connections\nD) Improper multiplexing technique and voltage mismatch\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the LED display system design. The correct answer, C, addresses two critical issues:\n\n1. Inadequate power supply: The documentation mentions that the LEDs require a 12V supply with forward voltages up to 7.8V for segments and 3.9V for decimal points. An insufficient power supply could lead to brightness inconsistencies, especially when multiple segments are lit.\n\n2. Direct Arduino pin connections: The Arduino Leonardo operates at 5V, which is insufficient to drive the high-voltage LEDs directly. Without proper level shifting or a driver IC, this voltage mismatch could cause flickering and inconsistent behavior.\n\nOption A is partially correct but doesn't address the power supply issue. Option B contains misconceptions; overestimating forward voltage would lead to dimmer LEDs, not inconsistent brightness, and a BCD decoder isn't necessarily related to the described problems. Option D introduces the concept of multiplexing, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the documentation but could be a valid approach; however, it doesn't address the fundamental voltage mismatch issue.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (power requirements, voltage matching, and proper driving techniques) and apply them to a real-world scenario of troubleshooting a malfunctioning display system."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/21", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69095", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5522/"], "docs_id": 69095, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am copying using `cp` or `mv` on the command line a large amount (\\>500gb) of files each sized between 600MB and 2\\.6GB to an external drive (a [Thermaltake BlacX Duet](http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/Product.aspx?C=1346&ID=1895)), but after a significant but inconsistent amount of transfer (e.g. 121gb) the following happens:\n\n* A message pops up in a dialog box that says \"The disk was not ejected properly.

Also, I show how to use the `stackengine` package to accomplish the stack.

There still is a pretty cool interpretation on gradient tree boosting, you can look that as additive algorithm where a update $F\\_m$ fix the residuals of previous model $F\\_{m\\-1}$ since $h\\_m$ is fitted to residuals (it's actually fitted to pseudo residuals but for quadratic loss they are the same) and then added to $F\\_{m\\-1}$ in order to attempt \"undo\" the errors generated by $F\\_{m\\-1}$, furthermore you can look at the learning $\\\\alpha$ as a cap to the 'model fixing' for prevent overfitting.\n\nAnswering your main question a boosting algorithm is any model that fits a additive expansion like that:\n\n$f(x)\\=\\\\sum\\_{m\\=1}^{M} \\\\beta\\_m f(x,\\\\theta\\_m)$\n\nor a tree expansion:\n\n$f(x)\\=\\\\sum\\_{m\\=1}^{M}\\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^{J\\_m}{b}\\_{jm}I(x \\\\in R\\_{jm})$"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about boosting algorithms, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is implementing a gradient boosting model for a complex classification problem. The model's performance is suboptimal, and they want to improve it without changing the base algorithm. Which of the following approaches is most likely to enhance the model's performance while staying true to the principles of gradient boosting as described in the documentation?\n\nA) Implement a dynamic instance re-weighting scheme after each iteration\nB) Adjust the learning rate \u03b1 to control the contribution of each tree\nC) Replace weak learners with strong, fully-grown decision trees\nD) Optimize the \u03c1_m parameter separately from the tree structure\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concepts presented in the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly mentions that in gradient tree boosting, a learning rate \u03b1 is introduced to prevent overfitting: \"Finally there is another change has been done to prevent overfitting which is to put a learning rate \u03b1 on model update: F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \u03b1 h_m(x)\".\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while instance re-weighting is a concept in traditional boosting, the documentation states that for gradient tree boosting, \"the 're-adjusting weights' interpretation would make you confuse on gradient tree boosting algorithm.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect because gradient boosting relies on weak learners, typically shallow trees. Using strong, fully-grown trees would go against the fundamental principle of boosting.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on the documentation's mention of optimizing b_jm = \u03c1_m \u03b3_jm together, rather than separately, as it's a one-dimensional optimization. Optimizing \u03c1_m separately would not align with the described optimal approach.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario of model improvement, and critically evaluate different approaches based on the principles of gradient boosting."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/12/24", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/521715", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/32623/"], "docs_id": 521715, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to hatch the region inside the rectangle, but outside the ellipses.

You'll probably extend this from `Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List`. In this block, create a method\n\n```\n/**\n * Gets the configurable options template if needed\n *\n * @param Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product\n * @return string\n */\npublic function getConfigurableHtml(Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product)\n{\n    if ($product->getTypeId() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable::TYPE_CODE) {\n        return Mage::app()->getLayout()\n        ->createBlock('modulename/catalog_product_view_type_configurable')\n            ->setProduct($product)\n            ->setTemplate('modulename/catalog/product/list/configurable.phtml')\n            ->toHtml();\n    }\n    return '';\n}\n\n```\n\nGo ahead and use a layout update to set the template to modulename/catalog/product/list.phtml as well.\n\nIn your list template (copied from base/default) you need to get the configurable html with our new method. You also need to wrap it in a form (make sure the add to cart button is in there). There should be a product collection somewhere (one for list mode, the other for grid)\n\n```\n<?php foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): ?>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $this->getSubmitUrl($_product) ?>\" method=\"post\" id=\"product_addtocart_form_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\"<?php if($_product->getOptions()): ?> enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"<?php endif; ?>>\n        <?php echo $this->getConfigurableHtml($_product) ?>\n        <?php echo $this->getPriceHtml($_product, true) ?>\n        <?php if($_product->isSaleable()): ?>\n            <p><button type=\"button\" title=\"<?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?>\" class=\"button btn-cart\" onclick=\"setLocation('<?php echo $this->getAddToCartUrl($_product) ?>')\"><span><span><?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?></span></span></button></p>\n        <?php else: ?>\n            <p class=\"availability out-of-stock\"><span><?php echo $this->__('Out of stock') ?></span></p>\n        <?php endif; ?>\n    </form>\n<?php endforeach ?>\n\n```\n\nNow create your configurable block and phtml (as defined in `getConfigurableHtml()` above)\n\nIn your configurable block, override `getJsonConfig()` to add a container class (each must be unique)\n\n```\nclass Namespace_Modulename_Block_Catalog_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n    extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n{\n    /**\n     * Composes configuration for js\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function getJsonConfig()\n    {\n        $config = Mage::helper('core')->jsonDecode(parent::getJsonConfig());\n        $config['containerId'] = 'configurable-container-' . $this->getProduct()->getId();\n        return Mage::helper('core')->jsonEncode($config);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd now in your `configurable.phtml`, create the select boxes, load the json config, and add your container class\n\n```\n<?php\n$_product    = $this->getProduct();\n$_attributes = Mage::helper('core')->decorateArray($this->getAllowAttributes());\n?>\n<?php if ($_product->isSaleable() && count($_attributes)):?>\n    <dl id=\"configurable-container-<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\">\n    <?php foreach($_attributes as $_attribute): ?>\n        <div class=\"option-wrapper\">\n            <dt class=\"title-wrap\"><label class=\"required\"><?php echo $_attribute->getLabel() ?></label></dt>\n            <dd class=\"option-wrap\">\n                <div class=\"input-box\">\n                    <select name=\"super_attribute[<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>]\" id=\"attribute<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>\" class=\"modulename-super-attribute-select\">\n                        <option><?php echo $this->__('Choose an Option...') ?></option>\n                    </select>\n                    <div class=\"options-arrow\"><img src=\"<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/option-arrow.png');?>\" alt=\"<?php echo $this->__('option arrow');?>\"/></div>\n                  </div>\n            </dd>\n        </div>\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\n    </dl>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var spConfig_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?> = new ModulenameProduct.Config(<?php echo $this->getJsonConfig() ?>);\n    </script>\n<?php endif;?>\n\n```\n\nNotice a few other things. The `modulename-super-attribute-select` classname on the the select, the uniquely named javascript var, and the custom `Product.Config()`. In all honesty, I was getting a little stuck, so this last part isn't pretty but it should work.\n\nCreate and include a JS file via layout update. What I did was copy and paste the `Product.Config` object here (copied from `js/varien/configurable.js`) because I was having trouble extending it. There was only one thing that needed changing \n\n```\nvar ModulenameProduct = {};\nModulenameProduct.Config = Class.create();\nModulenameProduct.Config.prototype = {\n    initialize: function(config){\n        this.config     = config;\n        this.taxConfig  = this.config.taxConfig;\n        if (config.containerId) {\n            // Add our special classname for the select to it doesn't conflict\n            this.settings   = $$('#' + config.containerId + ' ' + '.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        } else {\n            // here too\n            this.settings   = $$('.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        }\n        this.state      = new Hash();\n        this.priceTemplate = new Template(this.config.template);\n        this.prices     = config.prices;\n    // ...\n\n```\n\nAnd that should do it. I haven't completely tested this since my situation was a bit different, but it should get you started."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Magento developer is tasked with implementing configurable products on the category list page, allowing users to select options and add products to their cart without visiting individual product pages.

This conclusion can be drawn from several key points in the provided documentation:\n\n1. The definition of a cardinal states that it's an ordinal \u03b1 such that \u03b1 = |\u03b1|. Conversely, if \u03b1 is not a cardinal, then \u03b1 \u2260 |\u03b1|.\n\n2. For any ordinal \u03b1, we know that |\u03b1| \u2264 \u03b1. This is because there's always an enumeration of a set of size |\u03b1| in order-type \u03b1 (the ordinal \u03b1 itself with its usual well-ordering).\n\n3. Given that \u03b1 is not a cardinal and |\u03b1| \u2264 \u03b1, we can conclude that |\u03b1| < \u03b1. This is because if they were equal, \u03b1 would be a cardinal by definition.\n\n4. The fact that |\u03b1| < \u03b1 implies that there exists a bijection between |\u03b1| and some \u03b2 < \u03b1. This \u03b2 is a proper initial segment of \u03b1.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (ordinals, cardinals, cardinality) and tests the understanding of their relationships. It also challenges the student to apply these abstract concepts to a specific scenario, requiring analysis rather than mere recall.

However my work usually includes/investigates both procedures as tentative/possible approaches since only the data knows which approach is better or which approach delivers a more efficient model. \n\nResponse to comment @Veneeth :\n\nI didn't say less accurate I wrote (implied) different. A time based model predicts based upon the input variable/series 1,2,3,3,...t which means that the prediction for t\\+2 ,t\\+ 3 , t\\+ 4 is fixed or deterministic or unchanged because when you observe y(t\\+1\\) as it was before you observed y(t\\+1\\). The new value has no effect on the prediction if you don't re\\-estimate parameters while a model that uses the value of y(t\\+1\\) et. al. and is ARIMA based will provide different forecasts. If you use the time predictor approach and re\\-estimate with y(t\\+1\\) in addition to all the previous y's the impact of the new observation will be normally minimal on the model coefficients unless the sample size is very small or the new observation is an anomaly which should be identified and neutralized.\n\nSince @Veneeth asked for a quantitative example , I attempt here to answer that.\nWith apologies to Charles Dickens one could entitle this as \" A tale of three approaches\" I selected a real world example not a trivial textbook example which emphasizes the impact of presumption when it comes to model identification .

They are debating between using an autoregressive model (AR) and a linear regression model with time as a predictor. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the key difference in how these models would handle future predictions?\n\nA) The AR model will always provide more accurate predictions because it accounts for the stochastic nature of the time series.\n\nB) The linear regression model with time as a predictor will adapt more quickly to recent changes in the sales pattern.\n\nC) The AR model's predictions will be adaptive and responsive to recent observed values, while the linear regression model's predictions will remain fixed unless re-estimated.\n\nD) The linear regression model will inherently account for autocorrelation in the residuals, making it more suitable for time series data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key difference between autoregressive (AR) models and linear regression models using time as a predictor lies in how they handle future predictions. The correct answer, C, captures this distinction accurately.\n\nAn AR model uses previous values of the time series as predictors. This means that as new data points are observed, they are incorporated into the model's predictions for future time points. This makes AR models adaptive and responsive to recent trends or changes in the data.\n\nIn contrast, a linear regression model using time as a predictor estimates a fixed relationship between time and the variable of interest. Once this relationship is established, predictions for future time points are determined solely by extending this fixed trend line. These predictions don't change based on newly observed data points unless the entire model is re-estimated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the accuracy of AR models. While AR models can be more suitable for certain time series data, they aren't universally more accurate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the adaptive nature of the two models. The AR model, not the linear regression model, is more responsive to recent changes.\n\nOption D is incorrect and represents a common misconception. Linear regression models with time as a predictor often suffer from autocorrelated residuals, which is one of their drawbacks for time series data, not an advantage.\n\nThis question requires understanding the conceptual differences between the two approaches and their implications for forecasting, aligning with the goal of testing higher-level thinking skills."}, "60": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/21", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/151317", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/46956/"], "docs_id": 151317, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems that my website is not working and it showing errors.\n\nException printing is disabled by default for security reasons.\n\nError log record number: `272747104501`\n\nPlease help me to find the solution\n\n> a:5:{i:0;s:48:\"SQLSTATE\\[HY000] \\[2002] No such file or directory\";i:1;s:1654:\"\\#0 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php(109\\): Zend\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Pdo\\_Abstract\\-\\>\\_connect()\n>  \\#1 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/lib/Varien/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php(320\\): Zend\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Pdo\\_Mysql\\-\\>\\_connect()\n>  \\#2 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php(460\\): Varien\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Pdo\\_Mysql\\-\\>\\_connect()\n>  \\#3 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php(238\\): Zend\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Abstract\\-\\>query('SET NAMES utf8', Array)\n>  \\#4 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/lib/Varien/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php(428\\): Zend\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Pdo\\_Abstract\\-\\>query('SET NAMES utf8', Array)\n>  \\#5 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Resource.php(169\\): Varien\\_Db\\_Adapter\\_Pdo\\_Mysql\\-\\>query('SET NAMES utf8')\n>  \\#6 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Resource.php(110\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_Resource\\-\\>\\_newConnection('pdo\\_mysql', Object(Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_Config\\_Element))\n>  \\#7 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Resource/Setup.php(141\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_Resource\\-\\>getConnection('core\\_setup')\n>  \\#8 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Resource/Setup.php(234\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_Resource\\_Setup\\-\\>\\_\\_construct('core\\_setup')\n>  \\#9 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/App.php(417\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_Resource\\_Setup::applyAllUpdates()\n>  \\#10 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/App.php(343\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_App\\-\\>\\_initModules()\n>  \\#11 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/app/Mage.php(684\\): Mage\\_Core\\_Model\\_App\\-\\>run(Array)\n>  \\#12 /home/lalcointeriors/public\\_html/index.php(92\\): Mage::run('', 'store')\n>  \\#13 {main}\";s:3:\"url\";s:1:\"/\";s:11:\"script\\_name\";s:10:\"/index.php\";s:4:\"skin\";s:7:\"default\";}\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to go to the folder at the root of your Magento `var/report`.  \n\nHere you can find a file named `272747104501` in it you will find the detail of your error and the PHP stack leading to this error. \n\nIf you want to disable this feature and display the error directly in your browser **warning not do this in production mode** :  \n\nYou can go in the `errors/` directory at the root of your Magento and rename / copy the file `local.xml.sample` to `local.xml`.

What is the most likely underlying cause of this issue, and what should be the next troubleshooting step?\n\nA) The web server's PHP configuration is incompatible with Magento; review and update PHP settings\nB) There's a network connectivity issue between the web server and database; check firewall rules and network configuration\nC) The Magento installation is corrupted; reinstall Magento from a clean copy\nD) The MySQL socket file is missing or inaccessible; verify MySQL socket configuration and permissions\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The error message \"SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory\" typically indicates an issue with the MySQL connection, specifically relating to the socket file. Even though the MySQL server is running and the credentials are correct, the error suggests that Magento cannot establish a connection to MySQL.\n\nThis scenario requires integration of multiple concepts:\n1. Understanding Magento's error reporting system\n2. Interpreting SQL connection errors\n3.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The extreme temperature fluctuations (0\u00b0C to 230\u00b0C) are physiNEWally implausible in such a short time frame, especially without noticeable physical effects.\n2. A temperature of 230\u00b0C would be far beyond the melting point of many components and would cause immediate, catastrophic failure, which didn't occur.\n3.

Joint normal distribution is continuous, and is additive in the sense that if $X,Y$ are joint normal, then $X\\+Y$ are still normal, but they have infinite support (on the real line). I want something that is continuous, additive and has finite support. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **A minimal example** is obtained by taking literally *any* distribution with compact support on the nonnegative reals. Letting $F$ be its cumulative distribution function, this means there exist $0\\\\le a\\\\le b$ for which $F(a)\\=0$ and $F(b)\\=1\\.$ Repeated convolution produces the sequence of distribution functions $F\\_n,$ $n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots,$ for which $F\\_1 \\= F$ and for all $n\\\\ge 1,$\n\n$$F\\_{n\\+1}(x) \\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} F\\_n(x\\-y)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} F(y).$$\n\nBecause this corresponds to addition of random variables, the support of $F\\_n$ is contained in the interval $\\[na,nb],$ which is compact and non\\-negative.\n\nWhen $X\\_n$ is a random variable with distribution $F\\_n$ and $X\\_m$ a random variable with distribution $F\\_m,$ this ensures that $X\\_n\\+X\\_m$ has distribution $F\\_{n\\+m},$ showing this family $(F\\_n)$ is closed under addition. Its parameter is $n.$ When $F$ is a continuous distribution, so is $F\\_n.$ Thus, **$(F\\_n)$ satisfies all the requirements of the question.**\n\nAt <https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/43075/919> I describe such a family explicitly (and in great detail) where $F$ is the Uniform$(0,1\\)$ distribution. This shows that **the construction of $(F\\_n)$ is not just an abstraction:** it can lead to distributions with computable formulas and concrete applications.\n\n---\n\nIt might be objected that $n$ can attain only integral values. We can try to fix that. If there were such a family associated with all positive real $n$ it would be *infinitely divisible:* for all $n,$ the distribution $F\\_n$ could be expressed as the convolution of $F\\_{n/2}$ with itself, or generally the $k$\\-fold convolution of $F\\_{n/k}$ for any whole number $k.$ The [Wikipedia article on infinite divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_divisibility_(probability)) asserts that apart from atomic distributions (which concentrate all probability on a single value), **there exist no infinitely divisible family of distributions with \"bounded (finite) support.\"** It does not prove this, but refers to Sato, Ken\\-iti (1999\\), *L\u00e9vy Processes and Infinitely Divisible Distributions* for the details.\n\n**The minimal example can, however, be enlarged by adding in other distributions.** For instance, by adding in any atomic distribution supported on a non\\-negative value $\\\\mu$ we can introduce a *location parameter.* In effect, writing\n\n$$F\\_{n;\\\\mu}(x) \\= F\\_n(x\\-\\\\mu)$$\n\nwe create a two\\-parameter family where the parameter $n$ must be a whole number and $\\\\mu$ can be any non\\-negative real number. These distributions are supported on the intervals $\\[na\\+\\\\mu,nb\\+\\\\mu]$ which are non\\-negative and compact. For corresponding random variables $X\\_{n;\\\\nu}$ and $X\\_{m;\\\\mu},$ clearly $$X\\_{n;\\\\nu}\\+X\\_{m;\\\\mu}$$ has $F\\_{m\\+n;\\\\mu\\+\\\\nu}$ for its distribution. Thus, the family $$(F\\_{n;\\\\mu}),\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, \\\\mu \\\\ge 0$$ satisfies the condition of the question.\n\n**We can generate larger families very generally by emulating this process of combining two families of distributions under addition.** When $(G\\_n)$ is also an additively closed family of distributions with non\\-negative compact support, then for any pairs of whole numbers $m$ and $n$ let $H\\_{m,n}$ be the distribution of $X\\_m\\+Y\\_n$ where $X\\_m\\\\sim F\\_m$ and $Y\\_n\\\\sim G\\_n.$ The family $(H\\_{m,n},\\\\, m\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots)$ satisfies all the conditions of the question. This process can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n**In a specific sense, *all* solutions to this problem arise in this way.** When $\\\\mathcal F$ is any set of distributions with compact non\\-negative support, define the \"additive closure\" of $\\\\mathcal F$ to be the intersection of all sets of distributions that are additively closed and include $\\\\mathcal F.$ This intersection exists because the set of *all* distributions is one such set. All additively closed families obviously equal their own additive closures.

(As already commented by basics) But ok, limiting to a special case should still yield the desired result, so that's not it.~~ Silly me.\n\nNo. 2 is that you are missing the assumption of a linear medium that is usually used in deriving the integral $\\\\int \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\\\,\\\\text{d}V$ for the energy. In a Lagrangian formalism (and you might do the same with energy) the dielectric displacement is the conjugate quantity to the electric field, i.e. given a Lagrangian density $\\\\mathcal{L}$ we have\n$$\nD\\_i \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial E\\_i}\\\\,.\n$$\nFor a linear isotropic medium, with the free\\-field Lagrangian being\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2\n$$\nyou will find that $\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}$ and thus indeed\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E}\\\\,.\n$$\nIn a nonlinear model this is not generally true, for example for the electrostatic Heisenberg\\-Euler Lagrangian\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\n($E\\_0$ being some arbitrary constant field)\nyou will find that\n$$\n\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\+ 2 \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\nand subsequently\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\- \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\\\\,.\n$$\n\n**No. 3, the main point, is that you are starting with a wrong formula for the field energy.** The integral\n$$\nW \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\n$$\nis the energy of a collection of charges in vacuum, which you for example obtain by bringing each charge into position one after the other from infinity and calculating the work you do each time. You cannot use this for the energy in a continuous medium because when building up the charge distribution in the medium you also do some internal work to move the polarization charges that is not accounted for in the above formula for $W$.

So I would really appreciate if someone could explain to me what is going on here:\n\n* What is the intention of the `\\nhphantom` macro?\n* What does `\\sbox0` do?\n* What does `\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` do?\n\nI would also like to understand why the starred version of the `mathtools` commands don't work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TeX has something called a *box*, which is what it uses to organize things in the document. Knuth's TeX has 256 box registers for you to use. Think of that as 256 actual boxes available for TeX to store things and then use them in the document.\n\nThe command `\\sbox0{#1}` puts the contents of `#1` in the box register n\u00b0 `0`.\n\nNow that the box register `0` has `#1` you can do things with this box, like measure its width with `\\wd`, height with `\\ht`, and depth with `\\dp`, so `\\wd0` returns the with of the contents of the box `0`.\n\nSo, breaking apart the `\\nhphantom` macro:\n\n```\n% Store the contents of #1 into box register 0\n\\sbox0{#1}%\n% Go back -0.751 times the \\wd of the box register 0\n\\hspace{-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0 \\relax}\n\n```\n\nAlso, as egreg said in the comments, `-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` is redundant. The `\\the` will get the text representation of `\\wd0`, then the `\\dimexpr` will read this text back into a number. You can skip this back\\-and\\-forth with `-0.751\\wd0`, so you can simplify to:\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[1]{\\sbox0{#1}\\hspace{-0.751\\wd0}}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThis register principle is what makes up TeX's memory. TeX has:\n\n* `\\count` registers to hold counters (integers);\n* `\\dimen` registers to hold lengths;\n* `\\skip` registers to hold glue (one dimen plus another minus one more);\n* `\\muskip` registers to hold muglue (for maths);\n* `\\box` registers to hold boxes; and\n* `\\toks` registers to hold lists of tokens.\n\n---\n\nAs for your question about the starred versions (which I saw only now, sorry)...\n\nThe `\\sbox0{#1}` in the `\\nhphantom` macro saves the contents of `#1` in an `\\hbox`, which is *not* in math mode, thus you have to call `\\nhphantom` with `$...$` to enforce math mode. But this creates a math mode in text mode in math mode thing, which makes TeX \"forget\" about the rest of the equation it is in.\n\nWhen you use a starred version of a delimiter created by `\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX`, you make the outer delimiters be `\\left<delim>` and `\\right<delim>`, and the `\\delimsize` becomes `\\middle` to be used safely between `\\left` and `\\right`. The problem is that the math\\-in\\-text\\-in\\-math thing makes TeX forget about the surrounding `\\left` and `\\right` and the argument of `\\nhphantom` is `$\\middle\\lbrack$`, which is invalid because you cannot use `\\middle` without an enclosing `\\left...\\right`.\n\nTo workaround this issue I changed the `\\nhphantom` macro a little. It now has two arguments: the delimiter and the content in between. The `\\nhphantom` macro then measures the width of `\\left<delim>\\vphantom{#1}\\right.`, which is valid.\n\nHere is the complete working code:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\usepackage{mathtools}\n\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbrackets}[1]{\\lbrack}{\\rbrack}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrack}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrack \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrack \\nhphantom{\\rbrack}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbraces}[1]{\\lbrace}{\\rbrace}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrace}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrace \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrace \\nhphantom{\\rbrace}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dparens}[1]{\\lparen}{\\rparen}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lparen}{#1} \\delimsize\\lparen \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rparen \\nhphantom{\\rparen}{#1}\n}\n\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[2]{\\sbox0{$\\left#1\\vphantom{#2}\\right.$}\\hspace{-0.58\\wd0}}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n$\\dbrackets[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n\n%These do work :)\n\n$\\dbrackets*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens*{\\frac12}$\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A LaTeX developer is creating a custom macro for double delimiters and encounters issues with the starred version.

This approach addresses the core issue of math mode conflicts and allows for proper handling of starred versions of delimiters.\n\nThe problem arises because the original `\\nhphantom` macro creates a math-in-text-in-math situation, causing TeX to \"forget\" about the surrounding equation. This is particularly problematic for starred versions that use `\\left`, `\\right`, and `\\middle` delimiters.\n\nBy modifying `\\nhphantom` to take two arguments, we can measure the width of `\\left<delim>\\vphantom{#2}\\right.`, which is valid in all contexts.

Say the tunes will be just as loud in my ears, and if I'm understanding this correctly we could measure the decibel and record the sounds and they would be equal as well (if we ignore the fact that certain wavelengths travel better through air than others). But a person standing a further 100m away would only hear the loudest speaker (now 200m away), and not the low volume one (101m away). The dB and the sounds wouldn't be identical anymore.To me this doesn't make sense as sound is just air, and I would believe equally loud sounds at one place would fade equally with the same distance added.\n\nSo my question, why am I wrong (why isn't it like this in reality)?\n\nPlease forgive me for my explanatory problems as English is not my native language.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can understand it in the following way, where the key is that at different positions the energies of the sound are different.\n\nSuppose a speaker generates sound wave with energy $A$ at its own position, by energy conservation, at distance $R$, the energy one receives per unit area is\n\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA/(4\\\\pi R^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nHere I assume the space is isotropic in all directions.\n\nNow with the two speakers, suppose the louder speaker generates sound wave with energy $A\\_1$ while the quieter speaker generates sound wave with energy $A\\_2$. Here both $A\\_1$ and $A\\_2$ are the energies generated at the positions of the two speakers, respectively. Again, by energy conservation and assuming the space is isotropic, we have\n\n\\\\begin{split}\nA\\_1/(4\\\\pi R\\_1^2\\)\\=A\\_2/(4\\\\pi R\\_2^2\\)\n\\\\end{split}\nbecause these two speakers sound the same loud. When $R\\_1\\=100R\\_2$, we have \n\n\\\\begin{split}\nA\\_1/A\\_2\\=10000\n\\\\end{split}\n\nNow for an observer who stands at a position which is $200{\\\\rm m}$ from the loud speaker and $101{\\\\rm m}\\\\approx100{\\\\rm m}$, the energy produced by the loud speaker is\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA\\_1/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (200{\\\\rm m})^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\nand that produced by the quieter speaker is approximately\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA\\_2/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (100{\\\\rm m})^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nBecause $A\\_1/A\\_2\\=10000$, this time \n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\frac{A\\_1/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (200{\\\\rm m})^2\\)}{A\\_2/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (100{\\\\rm m})^2\\)}\\=2500\n\\\\end{equation}\nwhich means the energy from the louder speaker at this position is much larger than that from the quieter speaker, that is why that person can only hear the louder speaker."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about sound propagation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An acoustics engineer is designing a sound system for an outdoor concert venue. Two speakers are placed at different distances from the audience area. Speaker A is 100m away and produces sound at 110 dB, while Speaker B is 10m away and produces sound at 90 dB. Both speakers sound equally loud to listeners in the intended audience area. A complaint is received from residents living 500m behind the audience area. Which of the following best explains why these residents primarily hear Speaker A and not Speaker B?\n\nA) Sound waves from Speaker A have a longer wavelength, allowing them to travel further with less attenuation\nB) The inverse square law affects Speaker B more severely due to its lower initial volume\nC) The difference in initial energy output between the speakers becomes more pronounced at greater distances\nD) Speaker B's sound waves experience more atmospheric absorption due to their higher frequency\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires applying the concept of energy conservation in sound propagation and understanding how initial sound energy affects perception at different distances. The key lies in recognizing that the initial energy output of Speaker A is significantly higher than Speaker B, even though they sound equal at the audience area.\n\nUsing the inverse square law and energy conservation principles from the documentation:\n\n1. At the audience area: A1/(4\u03c0*100^2) = A2/(4\u03c0*10^2), where A1 and A2 are initial energies.\n2. Solving this, we find that A1/A2 = 100, meaning Speaker A's initial energy is 100 times greater than Speaker B's.\n\nAt 500m:\n- Energy from A: A1/(4\u03c0*500^2)\n- Energy from B: A2/(4\u03c0*510^2) \u2248 A2/(4\u03c0*500^2)\n\nThe ratio of these energies at 500m is still approximately 100:1 in favor of Speaker A.\n\nThis significant difference in initial energy output becomes more noticeable at greater distances, even though the percentage of energy loss is similar for both speakers. The residents primarily hear Speaker A because its sound energy remains much higher than Speaker B's at their location.\n\nOption A is incorrect because wavelength doesn't significantly affect this scenario. Option B is misleading; the inverse square law affects both speakers similarly. Option D introduces an irrelevant factor of frequency-dependent absorption.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of energy conservation in sound propagation, requires application of mathematical concepts, and challenges the intuitive notion that equally loud sounds at one point would remain equally loud at all distances."}, "75": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/279030", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/115149/"], "docs_id": 279030, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have many (at the moment around 30\\) different message classes in an application I am creating.

This approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. Code reuse: The base class can implement common serialization and deserialization logic, which can be reused by all derived classes that don't need custom behavior.\n2. Flexibility: Specific message classes can override the virtual methods to implement unique serialization processes when needed.\n3.

I live in eastern Massachusetts where it has recently been in the teens and 20s for low temps in winter.\nI have a large crawl space under my kitchen and 3 season porch ranging in height from 1' to 4' with no venting to the outside. I recently air\\-sealed the entire rim joist with an expanding foam and added a heavy mil plastic sheeting over the dirt floor, making sure to overlap and seal all edges. We also insulated the copper pipes in the space with closed cell insulation tubing and taped all joints to prevent the pipes from freezing. The kitchen is still very cold.  \n\nI would like to ideally insulate the space in between the floor joists and possibly the exterior brick foundation walls but are getting conflicting info on what to do. \n\n* Could use a poly spray foam kit, but the max R\\-values I have seen are only in the 7\\-10 range and its not anywhere close to warm enough outside to prevent it from failing. Everything I read says not to use apply when below 60 degrees or it will not cure properly. Its barely in the 30s right now! Also, the exterior walls are not all that clean and the foam might not stick.\n* Floor joists are not evenly spaced and range from 17\"OC to 22\"OC so batt insulation is going to be a pain.\n* Could use blown\\-in insulation but how do I get it to stay up there? Someone told me to use a plastic sheeting across all the joists with furring strips for extra support and then simply blow the insulation into each joist cavity, but I am worried that the plastic sheeting is too much of a vapor barrier and will cause mold inside the joist cavities. If the crawl space is already moisture sealed, am I OK? Do I need some sort of barrier up inside the cavities on the bottom of the floor?\n\nAlso, do I really need to insulate the brick foundation walls and will this show a big difference?

You can use wire springs to hold it in place and keep it from falling. I would then cover the entire area with 4 to 6 mil plastic, stapled to all the joists. Tape the joints, if any. Moisture should not be a major problem since you have already done what sounds like a good job sealing the dirt floor. In the summer months, some ventilation in the crawl space will also help avoid excess moisture.\n\nRigid foam glued to the foundation walls would also help if the area is fairly air tight.

Most of my sources seem to equal unstandardized coefficients in multiple regression with the semipartial correlation of that IV with the DV.

The result is that the semipartial is bounded between \\-1 and \\+1, while Beta is not.\n\nAside from the algebraic similarities, semipartial correlations are also conceptually closest to regression coefficients. In a regression analysis, we try to measure the unique explanatory power of predictors, i.e. the unique part of the *total* variance of Y that can be explained by X1, controlled for the other X\\-variables. That is, we residualize each X on other predictors to get its unique effect, but we do not residualize Y, as in the partial correlation.\n\nFor an excellent Powerpoint presentation on this topic, see [these slides by Michael Brannick of the University of South Florida](http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/mbrannick/regression/19%20Partial%20and%20Semi.ppt)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about multiple regression, semipartial correlations, and standardized coefficients, here's a challenging question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing the relationship between job performance (Y) and two predictors: years of experience (X1) and training hours (X2).

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Semipartial correlations and standardized coefficients (betas) have the same numerator but differ in the denominator.\n2. The semipartial correlation has a square root in the denominator (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)), while the standardized coefficient does not (1-r\u00b2).\n3. The more the predictors correlate, the more these values will differ.\n4. Semipartial correlations are bounded between -1 and +1, while standardized coefficients are not.\n\nGiven these facts, we can deduce that the semipartial correlations will always be smaller in magnitude than the standardized coefficients. This is because the denominator for semipartial correlations (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)) will always be larger than the denominator for standardized coefficients (1-r\u00b2), as \u221a(1-r\u00b2) > (1-r\u00b2) for any r\u00b2 between 0 and 1.\n\nIn this scenario, with R\u00b2 = 0.36 and a moderate correlation between predictors (r12 = 0.50), the difference between standardized coefficients and semipartial correlations will be noticeable.

The optoisolator approach (B) provides good isolation and a clean digital signal, but it's unnecessary for this low-voltage application and may introduce additional delay or bandwidth limitations.\n\n3. The BJT/MOSFET approach (C) improves on (A) by providing a sharper edge, but still lacks hysteresis to prevent multiple triggering near the threshold.\n\n4. The Schmitt trigger (D) is ideal because:\n   - It provides hysteresis, preventing oscillations and multiple triggering at the threshold point due to noise.\n   - It generates a clean square wave output, ideal for digital frequency measurement.\n   - It can handle the full 100-400 kHz range without issues from parasitic capacitances.\n   - It removes any DC component from the input signal.\n   - It's suitable for the given voltage levels without requiring isolation.\n\nThis solution addresses the concerns about noise, signal integrity, and accurate threshold detection, which are crucial for precise frequency measurement in the given range. It also aligns with the top answer's recommendation, demonstrating a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and its optimal solution."}, "89": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/01", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/30995", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/12829/"], "docs_id": 30995, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a magento store that sells products but in the meta description of every single product I want it to be formatted like this. \n\nProduct Name 1\nProduct Name 2\nProduct Name 3\n\nIs there any possible way I could add automatically do this instead of manually? \n\nChanging it to: \n\nSell Product Name 1 Here\nSell Product Name 2 Here\nSell Product Name 3 Here\n\nI want to add words to the beginning and the end automatically of every single listing if possible, if anyone knows a way please let me know.

Most databases have utilities to do bulk insert operations, some even expose those libraries to code as well if using command line utilities and batch files seem old fashioned.\n\nIf it's an insert/update/delete type of scenario, bulk insert into a staging table and then use RDMS specific technology to update the target table. \n\nFor example, SQL Server provides a nice [MERGE](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522522(v=sql.105).aspx) command to merge data to a target.\n\nBulk inserting 100,000 records will only take a second or so.

For example, while the battery charges under constant current.\n\nRoughly speaking, *in situ* is for studying the state, *operando* is for studying the process.\n\n**The question is: should \"*operando*\" or \"*in operando*\" be used?**\n\nI tried following the literature to avoid being wrong, but it does not help much. For example, Wikipedia has an article on [operando spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operando_spectroscopy), and there is no \"in\" anywhere in the article. There is also no \"in operando\" page on Wiktionary, only [\"operando\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/operando).

(Magistri, please correct any dubious details in the comments!)\n\nOperando is a gerund, i.e., a verbal noun, recognizable by its form. Gerunds often get translated into English with \"\\-ing\" gerunds, in this case \"operating\" or \"running\".\n\nThe o ending and context indicate that it is in the ablative case, which is a messy, multipurpose category for oblique functions often expressed with prepositions in English. It would be accurate to translate \"operando\" as \"in operation\" or \"while running\" or similar, but this form and meaning do not require the use of a preposition in Latin.\n\nIn contrast we have many phrases that use Latin nouns in the ablative to convey a similar concept (the technical means by which something is accomplished), but they often appear with the preposition \"in\". Why? Those phrases usually are expressing a physical (or figuratively physical) location or state in which something is accomplished (*in vitro* fertilization, *in situ* conservation, *in loco parentis*). For those functions and forms, Latin does use a preposition.\n\nI hope that helps!"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A materials scientist is designing an experiment to study the degradation of a novel battery electrode material during rapid charging cycles.

You could make \"Thank you for the invitation\" less formal by saying, \"Thanks very much for the invitation.\"\n\nBut \"Thank you\" doesn't sound formal! It can be said with various tones of voice.

It's now considered informal but increasingly accepted in various contexts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it fails to account for the documented evolution of \"invite\" as both a verb and a noun. Option C is a distractor based on the historical usage mentioned in the documentation but misapplied to the modern context. Option D oversimplifies the usage, ignoring the broader trend of informality in professional communication across industries.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about language evolution, professional communication norms, and the balance between formality and informality in modern contexts, rather than simple memorization of rules."}, "96": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/24", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/4485", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/647/"], "docs_id": 4485, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Background**  \n\nNow that TeX Live 2010 has a restricted `\\write18`, I figured it'd be reasonable to update my cv which uses the `bibunits` package to run BibTeX for each of the `.aux` files.\n\nCurrently, I have a macro `\\pubs` that typesets a label and then the bibliography (`\\pubs` is used inside a `cvlist` environment from `currvita`, but that is not important here).\n\n```\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand*\\pubs[2]{%\n        \\item[#1]\n        \\begin{bibunit}%\n                \\nocite{#2}%\n                \\putbib\n        \\end{bibunit}%\n        \\IfFileExists{\\@bibunitname.bbl}{}\n                {Run \\texttt{bibtex \\@bibunitname}}%\n}\n\\makeatother\n\n```\n\nIt is used like `\\pubs{Refereed papers}{foo,bar,baz}` to typeset the bibliography entries corresponding to the citation keys foo, bar, and baz (or it prints a helpful message if BibTeX hasn't been run).\n\n**Question**  \n\nHow can I modify this to run `bibtex \\@bibunitname` and then use the results in a sane way?\n\nOne idea I had that mostly works is\n\n```\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand*\\pubs[2]{%\n        \\item[#1]\n        \\begin{bibunit}%\n                \\nocite{#2}%\n                \\immediate\\write\\@bibunitaux{\\string\\bibdata{\\bu@bibdata}}%\n        \\end{bibunit}%\n        \\immediate\\write18{bibtex \\@bibunitname}%\n        \\InputIfFileExists{\\@bibunitname.bbl}{}\n                {Run \\texttt{bibtex \\@bibunitname}}%\n}\n\\makeatother\n\n```\n\nHere the `\\putbib` has been replaced with a write of the `\\bibdata` and `\\IfFileExists` has become `\\InputIfFileExists`. **When run, this complains that all of my citations are undefined, but the output looks fine.** In particular, all of the aux files are closed before they are read in from the `\\InputIfFileExists`.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After I wrote this answer I realised it's not exactly what you're trying to do.

They've implemented a macro that mostly works but encounters an issue where citations are reported as undefined despite correct output. Given this scenario, what is the most likely cause of the \"undefined citations\" warning, and how can it be resolved while maintaining the automation?\n\nA) The \\immediate\\write18 command is executing BibTeX before the .aux files are fully written, requiring a second LaTeX run to resolve citations.\nB) The \\InputIfFileExists command is reading the .bbl file before BibTeX has finished processing, necessitating a delay mechanism.\nC) The bibunits package is incompatible with the \\write18 command, requiring a different approach to automation.\nD) The \\nocite command is being executed after BibTeX runs, causing citations to appear undefined in the log but correct in the output.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The key to understanding this issue lies in the LaTeX compilation process and the timing of auxiliary file operations. The user's macro uses \\immediate\\write18{bibtex \\@bibunitname} to run BibTeX immediately after closing the bibunit environment. However, LaTeX processes documents in multiple passes:\n\n1. In the first pass, LaTeX writes citation information to the .aux files.\n2. BibTeX then processes these .aux files to create .bbl files.\n3. LaTeX needs another pass to read the .bbl files and resolve citations.\n\nThe \"undefined citations\" warning occurs because the BibTeX run happens within the same LaTeX pass that writes the citation information. When LaTeX encounters the citations later in this same pass, it hasn't yet had a chance to read the newly created .bbl files.\n\nTo resolve this, the user needs to:\n1. Allow LaTeX to complete its first pass, writing all .aux files.\n2. Run BibTeX on all .aux files between LaTeX passes.\n3. Run LaTeX again to input the .bbl files and resolve citations.\n\nThis could be achieved by moving the BibTeX execution to the end of the document or implementing a separate script to manage the compilation process. The current approach, while clever, tries to compress these steps into a single LaTeX pass, leading to the observed behavior where citations appear undefined in the log but correct in the final output.\n\nThis question requires understanding of LaTeX's multi-pass compilation process, the interaction between LaTeX and BibTeX, and the implications of using \\write18 for on-the-fly external command execution, thus testing critical thinking and application of TeX system knowledge."}, "97": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/03", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/211434", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/81218/"], "docs_id": 211434, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I want to know if skype is installed, I would type this:\n\n```\nviggy@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy skype\nskype:i386:\n  Installed: 4.0.0.8-1\n  Candidate: 4.0.0.8-1\n  Version table:\n *** 4.0.0.8-1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n```\n\nOr if Eclipse is installed:\n\n```\nviggy@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy eclipse\neclipse:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 3.7.2-1\n  Version table:\n     3.7.2-1 0\n\n```\n\nBut let's say I want to know if the Java Virtual Machine is installed.

They've successfully used `apt-cache policy` to check for Skype and Eclipse, but are struggling to verify the Java installation. Given this scenario, which approach would be most effective for identifying and verifying the Java installation on the system?\n\nA) Use `apt-cache policy java` repeatedly with different capitalization variations\nB) Execute `java -version` in the terminal to check for any installed Java runtime\nC) Search for Java-related packages using `apt search openjdk` or `apt search java`\nD) Manually browse the `/usr/lib/jvm/` directory for Java installations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the given information in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, is the most effective approach because:\n\n1. As shown in the documentation, `apt-cache policy java` and `apt-cache policy JVM` fail to locate the packages. This demonstrates that the exact package name for Java might not be obvious.\n\n2. Option A is ineffective because simply changing capitalization is unlikely to solve the problem, as package names are typically case-sensitive.\n\n3. Option B, while potentially useful for checking if Java is installed and getting its version, doesn't leverage the `apt` system knowledge demonstrated in the question and doesn't help identify the correct package name.\n\n4. Option D is a manual approach that might work but is less efficient and doesn't utilize the package management system.\n\n5. Option C is the most appropriate because:\n   - It uses the `apt` system, consistent with the knowledge demonstrated in the question.\n   - `apt search` allows for broader queries that can return related packages.\n   - Searching for \"openjdk\" or \"java\" is likely to return relevant Java packages, including the Java Virtual Machine.\n   - This approach helps identify the correct package name(s) for Java, which can then be used with `apt-cache policy` for detailed information.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply package management concepts, think critically about alternative approaches when direct methods fail, and understand the relationship between installed software and package names in Ubuntu systems."}, "98": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/30", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/326526", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10008/"], "docs_id": 326526, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From [Linear Optical Isolation for Safe Sensor Operation](https://www.digikey.ca/en/articles/techzone/2012/dec/linear-optical-isolation-for-safe-sensor-operation \"Linear Optical Isolation for Safe Sensor Operation\"):\n\n[![isolation circuit](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOTrm.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOTrm.jpg)\n\n* Are the three grounds indicated all connected?\n* Are the four Vcc indicated all connected?\n* If the above is all true, how could this be an isolated circuit?
