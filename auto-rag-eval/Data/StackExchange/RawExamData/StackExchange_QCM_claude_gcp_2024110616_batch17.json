Since $L^{\\-}$ is free, it admits a section\n$L^{\\-} \\\\rightarrow L$, and hence the kernel\n$L^{\\+}$ of $L \\\\rightarrow L^{\\-}$ is also free. Thus\nthe existence of a free rank one quotient asked\nfor in the question is equivalent\nto the existence of the exact sequence above.)\n\nThe answer to this question, in general, is no. The following argument\nis implicitly contained in papers of Wiese on the failure of multiplicity\none and weight one forms.\n\nThe action of $G\\_{\\\\Q\\_p}$ on $L^{\\+}$ is unramified and so acts\nvia $G\\_{\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p}$. Thus $\\\\Frob\\_p$ acts on a basis vector\nas multiplication by some element of $\\\\T$. Since $\\\\T$ is determined\nby its action on classical eigenforms,\none may identify this element with the Hecke operator $U$. In particular,\n$U \\\\in \\\\T$ (it wasn't clear whether your $\\\\T$ included $U$ or not).\n\nThe exact sequence remains exact after tensoring with $\\\\T/\\\\m$,\nfor dimension reasons. It follows that the sequence is split as a sequence\nof $\\\\T$\\-modules. Hence it remains exact after quotienting out by\nany ideal of $\\\\T$.\n\nSuppose that $\\\\rhobar: G\\_{\\\\Q} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{GL}\\_2(\\\\F\\_p)$ is\nirreducible and modular (mod\\-$p$) of weight $1$. Suppose, moreover, that \n$\\\\rhobar(\\\\Frob\\_p)$ acts by a scalar $\\\\lambda$.\nAssociated to $\\\\rhobar$ is a mod\\-$p$ weight $1$ form\n$f \\= \\\\sum a\\_n q^n \\\\in \\\\F\\_p\\[\\[q]]$. If $A$ is the Hasse invariant, then\nthen $Af$ and $f^p$ are both mod\\-$p$ modular forms of weight $p$. One can check\nthat all elements of the $\\\\F\\_p$\\-vector space $\\\\{Af,f^p\\\\}$ are eigenvalues for all the Hecke operators\n$T\\_l$ for $(l,p) \\= 1$, but the operator $T$ (and so $U$, which is the\nsame as $T$ in weight $\\> 1$) satisfies \n$(U \\- \\\\lambda)^2 \\= 0$ but does not act by a scalar. Since $U$ acts\ninvertibly on this vector space, it gives rise to a surjective map:\n$$\\\\T \\\\rightarrow \\\\F\\_p\\[\\\\eps]/\\\\eps^2,$$\nwhere the image of $T\\_l$ lands in $\\\\F\\_p$ for all $(l,p) \\= 1$, but $U$\ndoes not act by a scalar. Let $I$ be the kernel.\n\nThe Galois representation on $(\\\\T)^2/I \\\\simeq (\\\\F\\_p\\[\\\\eps]/\\\\eps^2\\)^2$\nis equal to $\\\\rhobar \\\\oplus \\\\rhobar$. This follows from a result of Boston\\-Lenstra\\-Ribet,\nsince $T\\_l$ is acting by a scalar for each $(l,p) \\= 1$. It follows, by assumption, that\nthe action of $G\\_{\\\\Q\\_p}$ on $L^{\\+}/I L^{\\+} \\\\simeq \\\\T/I$ must also be trivial,\nbecause this is a sub\\-representation of $\\\\rhobar \\\\oplus \\\\rhobar$. On the other hand, as we have seen, the action of Frobenius on $L^{\\+}$ and thus $L^{\\+}/I L^{\\+} \\= \\\\T/I$ is given\nby $U$, which is acting non\\-trivially $\\\\T/I$ by the construction of $I$.

Then, I use that parameter to fit statsmodel's logit model to the data (lambda \\= 1/C). At this step, I removed coefficients that are really small (\\< 1e\\-5\\). When I performed cross validation again on the reduced feature set to estimate my second penalty parameter, it ends up being stronger than the first penalty. This doesn't seem right to me, since the second step should be to find better estimates for features that you've already identified as non\\-zero from the first feature reduction step (so the lambda should be weaker). \n\nI've also noticed that a lot of p values for the coefficients in the statsmodel results are NaN, even though the model has converged. Does this happen because there is high multicollinearity among my features? I had assumed that the Lasso would be able to handle collinearity. Perhaps my cross validation isn't providing the best penalty parameter? \n\nFrom Elements of Statistical Learning: \n\n> ...the lasso shrinkage causes the estimates of the non\\-zero coefficients to be biased towards zero, and in general they are not consistent. One approach for reducing this bias is to run the lasso to identify the set of non\\-zero coefficients, and then fit an unrestricted linear model to the selected set of features. This is not always feasible, if the selected set is large. Alternatively, one can use the lasso to select the set of non\\-zero predictors, and then apply the lasso again, but using only the selected predictors from the first step. This is known as the relaxed lasso (Meinshausen, 2007\\). The idea is to use cross\\-validation to estimate the initial penalty parameter for the lasso, and then again for a second penalty parameter applied to the selected set of predictors. Since Statistical consistency means as the sample size grows, the estimates converge to the true values. The variables in the second step have less \u201ccompetition\u201d from noise variables, cross\\-validation will tend to pick a smaller value for \u03bb, and hence their coefficients will be shrunken less than those in the initial estimate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It looks like the summary table for logit always gives a NaN standard error for parameters whose coefficient estimate is shrunk to zero. Is this where you are seeing NaN standard errors? If so, these are not really NaN's, it's just that there isn't a good way to come up with a standard error for parameters that are shrunk to zero (or at least one has not been implemented here).

According to the documentation, the second penalty parameter should typically be smaller than the first, as stated: \"Since the variables in the second step have less 'competition' from noise variables, cross-validation will tend to pick a smaller value for \u03bb.\" Therefore, a stronger second penalty is unexpected and suggests a potential implementation error.\n\n2.

So naturally, if you make *one* release that has multiple bug fixes, you increment the patch component *once*. Leaving large gaps to account for intermediate states that *don't have a version* (not even in principle, like broken releases that have been withdrawn) makes no sense.\n\nYou could of course make a release for every single tiny change, but this is probably not desirable: It's a lot of work for you, it wastes user's time and bandwidth with frequent updates, and it results in ludicrous version numbers and release logs. There are various policies for when to release, and which works best is mostly a matter of opinion and the quirks of the project and its user base. Some common options are:\n\n* Some project release once every X time units, regardless of how many or few changes were done.\n* Some projects release once a subjective threshold of \"enough changes\" is reached.\n* Some projects have milestones: \"We'll release vX.Y once we have this thing and that thing done\".\n* A mix of the above.\n\nMost projects, even when they normally adhere to one of the above, can release out\\-of\\-line hot fixes when a particular nasty bug was released in the wild.\n\nConversely, if you put out new releases so rarely (or never) that most people just track git `master`, then you fail at semver because these people don't get any backwards compatibility guarantees.

The correct answer is C, which aligns with the guidance provided in the documentation. \n\nSemantic versioning is tied to releases, not individual commits or fixes.

This deviation from normality means that your underlying error distribution is probably slightly leptokurtic.

For perl, this means spinning up the interpreter, running it, and then letting the process terminate. When working with heavy loads, this became prohibitively expensive (memory and cpu).\n\nFastCGI reduced the overhead of CGIs by reusing the process, cutting back on the heavy forking of a process. This is more inline with application servers, which leads us to...\n\nThe development approach today is to have an application server in a language that has a light weight process threading model, which can handle very large loads (compared to the days of CGI). Of these you have Java, Go, and C\\# which follow this approach.\n\nThis doesn't mean perl is out. There are application servers for Perl. One rarely hears of Catalyst compared to things such as Zope, NodeJS, or the plethora of Java App servers.\n\nPart of this is timing.

With a dual-core processor, two threads can run in parallel without context switching. However, as the number of threads (t) increases beyond two, the processor must switch between threads more frequently.\n\n3.

This can be deduced from several key pieces of information:\n\n1. The size of the source device (loop0) is 3534848 sectors, which is approximately 1.7GB.\n2. The backing store (zram1) is a 256MB ramdisk, which is significantly smaller than the source device.\n3. The error message states \"Couldn't create exception store\", which suggests an issue with the storage used to track changes.\n\nThe snapshot mechanism requires enough space in the backing store to hold both the metadata for tracking changes and the actual changed data. A general rule of thumb is that the backing store should be at least 10-15% of the size of the source device, but this can vary based on the expected rate of change.\n\nIn this case, the 256MB backing store is likely too small to accommodate the metadata and potential changes for a 1.7GB source device.

The correct approach is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The original adapter doesn't specify a wide input range (100-240V), suggesting it's not designed for universal voltage input.\n2. The answer explains that the adapter is likely using a simple transformer (Option 1 in the explanation) due to the VA rating, which wouldn't work correctly with a different input voltage.\n3.

This method aligns with the \"fancier proof\" mentioned in the documentation and is confirmed by the reference to Bott-Tu's Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology. The key is to construct an explicit \"globalization\" morphism \u03c0: Tot\u2022(\u03a9\u2022(U\u2022)) \u2192 \u03a9\u2022(X) and a homotopy operator K: Tot\u2022(\u03a9\u2022(U\u2022)) \u2192 Tot\u2022(\u03a9\u2022(U\u2022))[-1] such that \u03c0j = id\u03a9\u2022(X) and j\u03c0 = idTot\u2022(\u03a9\u2022(U\u2022)) + [dtot,K]. \n\nUsing a partition of unity subordinate to the cover U is crucial for this construction, as it allows for a systematic way to \"glue\" local forms into global ones. This approach is more powerful than option A, which uses arbitrary smooth functions and might not guarantee the required properties.\n\nOption B, while valid, doesn't provide the explicit constructions asked for in the question. Option C, described as a \"brute force\" method in the documentation, lacks the elegance and insight of the preferred approach.\n\nThe reference to Bott-Tu's work, specifically Proposition 9.5, confirms that this is indeed a well-known and powerful technique in differential topology, despite its non-intuitive nature.

This solution aligns with the top answer provided in the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. Clear separation of concerns: The FSM approach separates the robot's possible states (e.g., idle, running a task, powering down) from the events that can occur (e.g., button presses, power down signal).\n\n2. Centralized event handling: The `processEvent` function serves as a single point of control for managing state transitions and task execution, making the code easier to maintain and debug.\n\n3. Flexibility and extensibility: New states and events can be easily added to the system without significantly altering the existing code structure.\n\n4. Improved error handling: The state machine approach allows for better control over valid state transitions and can easily handle unexpected events or invalid state changes.\n\n5. Thread safety: By using a synchronized event processor, the system can safely handle concurrent events without race conditions.\n\nOption A (nested if-else statements) would lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code and doesn't provide a clear structure for handling different states and events. Option C (separate threads with interrupts) could lead to race conditions and doesn't provide a clear way to manage the overall system state.

And once in a while, OOM\\-killer kills some process:\n\n```\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: active_anon:79945387 inactive_anon:3660742 isolated_anon:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: active_file:252 inactive_file:0 isolated_file:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: unevictable:0 dirty:2 writeback:0 unstable:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: free:12513746 slab_reclaimable:5001 slab_unreclaimable:1759785\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: mapped:213 shmem:41 pagetables:188243 bounce:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA free:15728kB min:0kB low:0kB high:0kB active_anon:0kB inactive_anon:0kB active_file:0kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:15332kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:0kB shmem:0kB slab_reclaimable:0kB slab_unreclaimable:0kB kernel_stack:0kB pagetables:0kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? yes\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 2965 193855 193855\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA32 free:431968kB min:688kB low:860kB high:1032kB active_anon:0kB inactive_anon:0kB active_file:0kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:3037072kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:0kB shmem:0kB slab_reclaimable:0kB slab_unreclaimable:0kB kernel_stack:0kB pagetables:0kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? yes\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 190890 190890\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 Normal free:6593828kB min:44356kB low:55444kB high:66532kB active_anon:178841380kB inactive_anon:7783292kB active_file:540kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:195471360kB mlocked:0kB dirty:8kB writeback:0kB mapped:312kB shmem:48kB slab_reclaimable:11136kB slab_unreclaimable:1959664kB kernel_stack:5104kB pagetables:397332kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0 0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 1 Normal free:43013460kB min:45060kB low:56324kB high:67588kB active_anon:140940168kB inactive_anon:6859676kB active_file:468kB inactive_file:56kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:198574076kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:540kB shmem:116kB slab_reclaimable:8868kB slab_unreclaimable:5079476kB kernel_stack:2856kB pagetables:355640kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0 0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA: 2*4kB 1*8kB 2*16kB 2*32kB 2*64kB 1*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 1*1024kB 1*2048kB 3*4096kB = 15728kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA32: 10*4kB 11*8kB 12*16kB 13*32kB 12*64kB 5*128kB 7*256kB 10*512kB 9*1024kB 6*2048kB 98*4096kB = 431968kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 Normal: 1648026*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 6592104kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 1 Normal: 8390977*4kB 1181188*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 43013412kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: 49429 total pagecache pages\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: 48929 pages in swap cache\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Swap cache stats: add 2688331, delete 2639402, find 16219898/16530111\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Free swap  = 3264kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Total swap = 512248kB\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 100663294 pages RAM\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 1446311 pages reserved\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 10374115 pages shared\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 84534113 pages non-shared\n\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ pid ]   uid  tgid total_vm      rss cpu oom_adj oom_score_adj name\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 3878]     0  3878 32042399 31569413  10       0             0 qemu_wl52\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 4321]     0  4321 32092081 31599762  20       0             0 qemu_wl51\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 4394]     0  4394 32106979 31575717  15       0             0 qemu_wl50\n...\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: Out of memory: Kill process 3878 (qemu_wl52) score 318 or sacrifice child\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: Killed process 3878, UID 0, (qemu_wl52) total-vm:128169596kB, anon-rss:126277476kB, file-rss:176kB\n\n```\n\nComplete dump: <http://evilcigi.eu/msg/msg.txt>\n\nThen i start the killed guest and from that moment, everything is OK, for a few days..

Or is there something I'm missing?\n\nOne thing comes to my mind, that host puts all free memory in buffers and cache and then suffers from memory shortage (invokes OOM\\-killer)? But that, i think, shouldnt happen, right? Also, that doesnt explain the behavior before the killing.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n---\n\nso today the problem occurs again, here is the content of /proc/meminfo: \n\n```\nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:         9720268 kB\nBuffers:        53354000 kB\nCached:            22196 kB\nSwapCached:       343964 kB\nActive:         331872796 kB\nInactive:       41283992 kB\nActive(anon):   305458432 kB\nInactive(anon): 14322324 kB\nActive(file):   26414364 kB\nInactive(file): 26961668 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:              0 kB\nDirty:                48 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      319438656 kB\nMapped:             8536 kB\nShmem:               164 kB\nSlab:            9052784 kB\nSReclaimable:    2014752 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7038032 kB\nKernelStack:        8064 kB\nPageTables:       650892 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   383832752 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31502336 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nIt seems that all the \"free\" memory is spent in buffers.\n\n---\n\nAfter hints from @Matthew Ife about memory fragmentation, I have compacted the memory and also dropped the caches (to free up 60 GBs in buffers) on Host, with those commands:\n\n```\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\necho 1 >/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory\n\n```\n\nHere is what memory fragmentation looks like now:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 2398537 469407 144288  97224  58276  24155   8153   3141   1299    451     75 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 9182926 2727543 648104  81843   7915   1267    244     67      3      1      0\n\n```\n\n---\n\nupdate 2014/11/25 \\- server is overloaded again:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 4374385  85408      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 1830850 261703    460     14      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \n\n# cat /proc/meminfo \nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:        28038892 kB\nBuffers:        49126656 kB\nCached:            19088 kB\nSwapCached:       303624 kB\nActive:         305426204 kB\nInactive:       49729776 kB\nActive(anon):   292040988 kB\nInactive(anon): 13969376 kB\nActive(file):   13385216 kB\nInactive(file): 35760400 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:             20 kB\nDirty:                28 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      305706632 kB\nMapped:             9324 kB\nShmem:               124 kB\nSlab:            8616228 kB\nSReclaimable:    1580736 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7035492 kB\nKernelStack:        8200 kB\nPageTables:       702268 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   384014048 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31670272 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nand in syslog are some page allocation failures:\n\n```\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: qemu_wl50: page allocation failure. order:4, mode:0x20\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Pid: 4444, comm: qemu_wl50 Not tainted 2.6.32-431.17.1.el6.x86_64 #1\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Call Trace:\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: <IRQ>  [<ffffffff8112f64a>] ?

Sometimes there are layers to these functions, so that `func1` calls `func2` calls `func3` calls `func4`, where a parameter of `func4` is passed through all the way from `func1`. In this case, it would not make sense to make any of these parameters instance/class attributes.\n\nA 1\\-layer example:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    # Calculate E with my_func args\n    E = some_calculations(A, B)\n\n    # Call helper, passing through some parameters\n    return helper(C=C, D=D, E=E)\n\ndef helper(c, d, e):\n    return some_other_calculations(C, D, E)\n\n```\n\nI'm trying to write some dosctrings for these functions, and I am having trouble formulating a way to effecitvely document the arguments that are passed through to the helper function(s).\n\nIn particular, I see a few options:\n\n### Method 1\n\nPoint to `helper`'s dosctring:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: See `helper` \n    :param D: See `helper`\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Only ever have to update/maintain one description of a given parameter\n\n**CON:** If we add another function `outer_func` that calls `my_func` and passes `C` and `D` to it, which in turn passes `C` and `D` to helper, we will have to point to either `my_func` or `helper`.\n\nIn the former case this would lead to another forwarding, daisy\\-chaining the reader through multiple dosctrings just to get a description. In the latter case, it would be unclear where in `outer_func` that `helper` is called.\n\n### Method 2\n\nSimply copy the description for each function that uses it\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Do not have to look through other functions to understand the argument\n\n**CON:** Obviously, multiple descriptions will have to be maintained. Also, it may difficult to describe the parameters without reference to the functions which use them, in which case you are probably forwarding them to the other functions anyway. This effectively leads to the cons of method 1 without the pro.\n\n### Method 3\n\nBrief description \\+ forwarding\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: Brief parameter C description.

Doing this exposes implementation details that are not relevant to the use case your function fulfills. Instead, use the docstring comments to describe that parameter within the context of the method that calls the helper.\n\nThe docstring comments for the helper method should probably be very general. Presumably the helper is used in a larger number of use cases, therefore the phrasing used to describe the helper method parameters will be very generic. The docstring comments for the method which calls the helper should be use case\\-specific.\n\nThe names of functions chosen for the question are too generic to give you specific advice. Instead, let's use a contrived example that at least gives us a concrete use case.\n\nSay you have a method which formats the price for an entire shopping cart. That method calls a helper to format a number as currency (the helper method).\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nIn each case, phrase docstring comments so they make sense within the context the method gets used. The `format_currency` method is general purpose, so the words used to describe the parameters should also be general purpose. Frankly, even the parameter names should be general purpose:\n\n```py\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  # :param amount: The amount to format as currency\n  # :param currency_format: A currency format string\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nThe words \"amount\" and \"currency format\" can be applied to any use case where you have a number that should be formatted as currency.\n\nThe `format_shopping_cart_price` method is use case\\-specific: it formats the total price of a shopping cart as currency. Even though the `currency_format` parameter is simply passed to the helper method, the docstring comment can be tailored to the use case of formatting the shopping cart price:\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  # :param shopping_cart: The shopping cart whose total price should be formatted as currency\n  # :param currency_format: The currency format string used to format the shopping cart price\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\n```\n\nIn the example above, the term \"amount\" is basically replaced by \"shopping cart price\". Copying and pasting docstring comments, while easy, isn't necessarily desirable. You miss opportunities to use docstring comments to communicate use case\\-specific information that aids other programmers in calling your methods.\n\nI'll end this with *one more* possible solution to this conundrum. Does a \"helper\" method need docstring comments? Does your other function need docstring comments? By carefully choosing class, method, and parameter names you can often skip writing comments. The names of things are enough of a description that docstring comments are extra work for no extra value."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about documenting function parameters in Python, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is refactoring a complex Python codebase with multiple nested function calls. They're debating the best approach for documenting parameters that are passed through several layers of functions. Which of the following strategies would be most effective in balancing code maintainability, clarity, and adherence to the principle of information hiding?\n\nA) Use Method 1, pointing to the helper function's docstring for all passed-through parameters\nB) Implement Method 2, copying full parameter descriptions for each function that uses them\nC) Adopt Method 3, providing brief descriptions with references to helper functions\nD) Follow the top answer's advice, documenting parameters in the context of each function's specific use case\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most effective strategy is to follow the top answer's advice, which suggests documenting parameters in the context of each function's specific use case. This approach addresses several key principles of software documentation and design:\n\n1. Information Hiding: By not explicitly documenting that parameters are passed through to other functions, it maintains encapsulation and doesn't expose unnecessary implementation details.\n\n2. Context-Specific Documentation: It allows for more meaningful, use-case specific descriptions of parameters, which is more helpful for developers using the functions.\n\n3. Flexibility: This approach adapts well to changes in the underlying implementation without requiring updates to multiple docstrings.\n\n4. Clarity: It provides clear, relevant information to users of each function without overwhelming them with details about internal function calls.\n\n5. Maintainability: By focusing on the purpose of parameters within each function, it reduces redundancy and the need to update multiple docstrings when changes occur.\n\n6. Scalability: This method works well even as the codebase grows and function call hierarchies become more complex.\n\nWhile the other options (Methods 1, 2, and 3) have some merits, they each have significant drawbacks. Method 1 can lead to confusing chains of references, Method 2 introduces maintenance issues with duplicated information, and Method 3, while a compromise, still exposes more implementation details than necessary. The top answer's approach provides the best balance of informative documentation without sacrificing code design principles."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/10", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/380847", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/6101/"], "docs_id": 380847, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\\\\mathbb R^n$ with $n\\\\ge 2$ (say if you like $n\\=2$, which is possibly sufficiently representative).\n\n**Q:** *Does there exist a closed simple curve $u:\\\\mathbb S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb R^n $ such that $K\\\\cup u(\\\\mathbb S^1 )$ is connected?*\n\nThe set $K$ may have uncountably many connected components, and $u$ has to meet them all. Yet this does not seem a serious obstruction. For instance, the cartesian square of the Cantor set can be connected by some simple self\\-similar curve (necessarily of infinite length; in fact I think of dimension at least $4/3$), e.g. just connecting suitably the four main square clusters between them by segments, and then iterating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not always.\n\nLet $K$ be a subset of an ambient space $V$ ($V\\=\\\\mathbf{R}^2$ is fine, but doesn't matter) that is the closure of a discrete subset $D$, such that $K\\-D$ is homeomorphic to a segment.

Since $j(S)\\=S$ has empty interior in $K$ and $K\\\\subset C$, it has empty interior in $C$. This is a contradiction with the above fact.\n\n\\[Edit: I initially described $K$ as subset of the sine curve, but this doesn't matter and complicates the description.]\n\n---\n\nMinor variant: let $M$ be any compact subset with empty interior, which is not homeomorphic to any subset of a circle (e.g., the whole sine example in the plane, a sphere in a higher space).

This scenario is directly described in the top answer of the documentation.\n\nIn this case, K is constructed as the closure of a discrete subset D, with K-D being homeomorphic to a line segment. The key properties of this set that make it a counterexample are:\n\n1. Any closed subset meeting every component of K must contain all of D, and thus its closure, which includes the segment K-D.\n2. If a simple closed curve C were to meet every component of K, it would have to contain all of K.\n3. However, the segment K-D would have to have empty interior in C (as it has empty interior in K), which contradicts the fact that any homeomorphic image of a line segment in a circle must have non-empty interior in that circle.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that it's not always possible to find a simple closed curve that connects all components of a compact set K in R^n (n \u2265 2).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Cantor set alone doesn't provide a counterexample; in fact, the question mentions that the Cartesian square of the Cantor set can be connected by a self-similar curve.\n\nOption C is not specific enough to be a counterexample and doesn't capture the key properties needed.\n\nOption D, like A, doesn't provide a counterexample, as it's similar to the Cartesian square of the Cantor set mentioned in the question, which can be connected.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of topological concepts, integration of multiple ideas from the documentation, and critical thinking about the properties of compact sets and simple closed curves in R^n."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/17", "source": ["https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/9393", "https://meta.serverfault.com", "https://meta.serverfault.com/users/43158/"], "docs_id": 9393, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In connection with the moderator elections, we are holding a Q\\&A thread for the candidates.

Do you feel there are any issues with the relative amount and types of participation on ServerFault of long\\-term, high\\-rep users compared to newer, lower\\-rep users? If so, what would you try to do as a moderator to address these issues?\n\nI think it's unfortunate that many long\\-term, high\\-rep users have largely stopped participating on ServerFault, there are fewer highly experienced sysadmins posting excellent answers than there used to be. I don't think there's much that a single moderator can do to either bring back the users who left or to develop new high\\-rep users.\n\nFor example, I've tried a few times over the years to focus on voting for new users who were fairly active to see if that encouraged them to stick around, but I didn't see any sign of it working. I don't think a single person or a single moderator can do much to encourage people to stick around and become long\\-term users.\n\n> 2. What time zone are you in? If different, what time zones do you think you will be able to be active in for the purposes of moderation? ([HBrujin](https://serverfault.com/users/37681/hbruijn) will be stepping down as a moderator after this election, which leaves [Sven](https://serverfault.com/users/8897/sven) as the only coverage during active CET hours)\n\nAs mentioned in my nomination, I'm in the Pacific (UTC\\-8\\) time zone, and tend to stay up late. \n\n> 3. Moderators see the review\\-queues a little differently. How do you see yourself handling answers from a new user that could be great with a little clarification, yet has earned at least one `not an answer` flag?\n\nThe ideal thing to have happen with an answer that could be improved by a bit of cleanup is for it to be edited, and moderators can do that as can many regular users. But the whole point of review queues is that it *shouldn't* be just moderators handling that sort of clean up, so I think most of those cases would be better dealt with by comments \\- suggesting what could make it a better answer.\n\n> 4. What do you believe a moderators role is, in cultivating good content for the site? With the decline in both new content and votes, do you believe as a moderator this should affect your behavior?\n\nAlthough moderators have some tools for eliminating bad content, I don't think they should be soley responsible for it; regular users need to be involved as well. When it comes to encouraging good content, I think moderators should lead by example to some extent (e.g. by editing and leaving constructive comments), but they can't be expected to do all the editing and commenting.\n\n> 5. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?\n\nI think the usual tool for dealing with this \\- a temporary ban \\- is the right way to go. Explain to the user what the problem is and use the banning system to give them a chance to cool off.\n\n> 6. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?\n\nIn order, I would: talk to that mod and try to come to an understanding, discuss it with other SF mods, and finally bring it up in the mod\\-only discussion room if necessary. Somewhere along that path, I'm sure there'd be an understanding of how it should/shouldn't have been dealt with.\n\n> 7. In your opinion, what do moderators do?\n\nI think moderators *should* mostly deal with the bigger problems: with accounts that are spamming, with voting irregularities, with comments getting out of hand, etc. I think the second special thing about moderators is that because their words carry somewhat more weight, they shouuld try to maintain a desirable \"tone\" for the site \\- leaving good comments, etc.\n\n> 8. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?\n\nI'm comfortable with everything I've posted on SF, on meta.SF, on other SE sites, on Chat... I don't think there's anything that would look bad with a diamond after it, and at this point in ServerFault's life cycle it's unlikely that anyone is going to find much that's interesting in *any* 7 or 8 year old post or comment.\n\n> 9. In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?\n\nModerators have a few tools that even a high\\-rep user doesn't: unilateral close or open voting, comment cleanup, banning... Those could all be used to greater effectiveness."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A moderator candidate for ServerFault is considering how to address the decline in participation from long-term, high-rep users.

As I understand it, you have a capacitor, resistor, and LED all in series, and you want to know how things decay if the capacitor starts out initially charged up.\n\nAt first apporoximation, you can consider the LED a voltage source. That means the current will decay just as if the LED wasn't there and the cap was charged up to the LED voltage less than what it really was. This is now a simple R\\-C systems which follows a basic exponential decay with a time constant of RC, which it seems you already understand. The question of when the LED goes \"off\" then comes down to at what current you consider the brightness to be low enough to be off. This can vary a lot by the efficiency of the LED, ambient light level, and how obvious \"on\" is supposed to be. For example, if the cap is initially charged so that the initial current is 20 mA (a common maximum for LEDs) and you consider 1 mA the \"off\" level, then the on time will be the 95% decay time, which is 3\\.0 time constants.\n\nAs I said, this was the basic first approximation where the LED has a fixed voltage accross it. That will be largely true, but of course its voltage will drop with current somewhat. For practicle purposes, this is a small effect compared to the slop of deciding what current level \"off\" really is, unless that current is small, like less than a mA."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the capacitor-resistor-LED circuit, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit with a capacitor (C), resistor (R), and LED in series.

This approach treats the LED as a constant voltage source (US), which is a reasonable approximation for most of the discharge process. The equation U(t) = US + (U0 - US) e^(-t/RC) accounts for both the LED's threshold voltage and the RC time constant of the circuit.\n\nOption A, while simpler, doesn't account for the LED's threshold voltage and would overestimate the discharge time.

Option D ignores the resistor, which plays a crucial role in determining the discharge rate and cannot be neglected.\n\nThe chosen approach (B) balances accuracy and simplicity by:\n1.

Given the system's current state and the need to minimize disruption, what is the most appropriate and comprehensive approach to successfully install Azure CLI?\n\nA) Modify the installation script to use the existing Python 2.7.13 in /usr/local/bin/python2.7\nB) Upgrade the system-wide Python from 2.6.6 to 2.7 using yum\nC) Install Python 2.7 in a separate directory, create symbolic links, and modify system PATH\nD) Use a containerized version of Azure CLI to bypass system Python requirements\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of the provided solution to a real-world problem. The correct approach is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The system already has Python 2.6.6 as the default, which cannot be directly upgraded without potentially breaking system dependencies.\n\n2. Simply modifying the installation script (option A) wouldn't work because it doesn't address the system PATH issues, and the Azure CLI might have other dependencies expecting Python in specific locations.\n\n3. Upgrading the system-wide Python (option B) is risky on a legacy system and could break existing applications or system utilities.\n\n4. While using a containerized version (option D) could work, it's not mentioned in the documentation and might introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe correct solution, as outlined in the documentation, involves:\n- Installing Python 2.7 in a separate directory (/usr/local)\n- Creating a symbolic link to make it accessible as 'python'\n- Modifying the system PATH to prioritize /usr/local/bin\n\nThis approach ensures that the new Python 2.7 is available for Azure CLI without disrupting the existing system Python. It also demonstrates understanding of system administration concepts like symbolic links and PATH manipulation, which are critical for managing complex environments.\n\nThe question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (Python versions, system paths, symbolic links) and apply them to solve a real-world problem in a legacy environment, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/06/22", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/30034", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 30034, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are running MySql 5\\.x on Solaris 10\\.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the nature of black holes as described in the documentation. Black holes are indeed three-dimensional celestial bodies, similar to planets or stars, but with extreme gravitational properties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it represents a two-dimensional understanding of black holes, which is a common misconception based on oversimplified internet images.

This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. It leverages zsh's powerful string manipulation and associative array features, making the code concise and readable.\n2. The solution naturally handles the requirement to group by ServiceID (the second part of the filename) and select the latest file for each group.\n3. It takes advantage of the lexicographic sorting of filenames, which in this case corresponds to chronological order, eliminating the need for explicit date comparisons.\n4. The use of glob qualifiers (like (N) for nullglob) makes the script more robust against edge cases.\n\nWhile options A and B could potentially solve the problem, they would likely be less efficient and more error-prone. Option D, using Python, would work but introduces unnecessary complexity and deviates from the requirement of using a UNIX shell script.\n\nThe zsh solution demonstrates advanced shell scripting techniques and efficient use of built-in features, making it the most appropriate choice for a DevOps environment where shell scripting skills are crucial."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/05/30", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/316244", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/30156/"], "docs_id": 316244, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Bank robber [Willie Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Sutton) said:\n\n> Why did I rob banks?

The correct answer, C, best captures the essence of Sutton's explanation. \n\nIn the documentation, Sutton compares the money from bank robberies to chips won in gambling, stating \"But to me the money was the chips, that's all.

The answer is: Boxing. And now that seemingly **male spectacle** is attracting women.\n\nDoes ***male spectacle*** mean dominated by men?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary sense of **male** denotes the sex of an animal, as an adjective: men, boys, rams, bulls, and peacocks are all **male**; women, girls, ewes, cows, and peahens are all **female**.\\*\n\nThe sentence that you are asking about uses **male** in an extended sense. Since boxing is not an animal, you can safely infer that the author wants you to understand **male** not in its primary sense, but in some way *related to* its primary sense. You must infer the exact meaning from context.\n\nIn this case, **male spectacle** means an activity that men, but not women, perform, which creates a visually conspicuous show that attracts other people's attention (a \"spectacle\"). This usage of **male** is similar to its meaning in **[male display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_display#Male_display)**, referring to things like the spreading of a peacock's [tail feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl#/media/File:Paonroue.JPG). The display is not itself literally male. The display is an action distinctive to males of that species; the females don't do it.\n\nI don't understand the word **male** in this context to mean **male\\-dominated**, though the meanings are somewhat ambiguous. The primary (though rare) sense of **dominate** is to hold power over someone; a common secondary sense is to exist in the greatest number or proportion in some area. If thousands of women took up boxing, they would still be outnumbered by male boxers, and so the sport would still be male\\-dominated in that secondary sense. Men might still control the sport, too, so it would still be male\\-dominated in the primary sense. I understand **male spectacle** in the quoted sentence to regard boxing as something like the peacock's tail display: an activity performed exclusively by men. However, the phrase and context are not fully clear about this, and I doubt that the author thought about it carefully.\n\nNote that, in this context, there is a slight difference in meaning between **male spectacle** and **masculine spectacle**. **Masculine** denotes the qualities distinctively associated with maleness, but not maleness itself. It's not a self\\-contradiction to say that a certain woman has some masculine qualities\u2014for example, a deep voice, or an urge to get into fistfights. Through the choice of the word **male** or **masculine**, the author guides the reader to understand the phrase by extending one primary sense or the other: the male sex, or the qualities associated with it. The choice of **male** rather than **masculine** agrees with the author's meaning of \"Boxing was formerly performed only by men, but now women are starting to box, too.\"\n\n---\n\n\\*\u00a0By the way, English has a peculiar ambiguity regarding the words **animal**, **man**, **cow**, and **peacock**. One sense of **animal** is any organism that moves itself from place to place and has consciousness, human or otherwise; another sense of **animal** means only non\\-human animals. One sense of **man** includes humans of both sexes; another sense, much more common, means only male humans. One sense of **cow** includes all animals of the genus *[Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos);* another sense means only females of the genus *Bos.* Even the word **peacock** commonly refers to both sexes of the [peafowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl), despite the fact that **\\-cock** specifically designates a male bird. The word **peacock** is well\\-known, **peahen** is not well\\-known, and **peafowl** is almost unheard\\-of in everyday English."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the use of \"male spectacle\" in the context of boxing, I'll create a question that requires analysis and application of the concepts discussed:\n\nQuestion: A sports journalist is writing an article about the increasing participation of women in traditionally male-dominated combat sports.

Consider the situation where someone had their code on Google Code, or Source Forge with the license in the issue tracker over there and then migrated the project to github... and there's no hint of a license file any more.\n\nSpecifically with GitHub and its culture of forking, one should also look at what one sees when downloading or cloning from a *fork*. There isn't even a hint of an issue containing the license in the forked code. For that matter, the fork might have enabled its *own* issues on there and claiming a WTFPL license on it (anyone downloading from the fork and going to `https://github.com/sjane/acme/issues/97` hinted at by someone as containing the license in it could see something completely different than the MIT).\n\nThe license needs to be distributed with the library and source files. Otherwise there is no license on them and it makes the legal department rather twitchy.\n\nFurthermore, issue trackers aren't tied to a revision. Consider if jsmith later decides to switch from MIT to GPL (as the only author, perfectly acceptable). And now... what's the license? There's one issue here that says its MIT and another one there that says its GPL. If I clone from revision 1, what license is it under? What about if I clone from revision 2?\n\nThe only way to resolve this is if the license is part of the distribution itself. Posting it in an issue tracker doesn't actually identify the license that a given revision is under.

They observe that the heat capacity (C) follows the relation C = aT + bT\u00b3, where 'a' and 'b' are constants, and T is the temperature. At what temperature range would you expect the electronic contribution to heat capacity to be most significant, and what experimental approach should be taken to accurately measure it?\n\nA) Below 1K; Use adiabatic demagnetization to reach ultra-low temperatures and a SQUID-based calorimeter for precise measurements\nB) Around 10K; Employ a standard helium cryostat and use the relaxation method for heat capacity measurements\nC) Between 20-30K; Use a closed-cycle refrigerator and measure heat capacity through dual-slope integration\nD) Above 50K; Utilize a nitrogen-cooled cryostat and measure heat capacity through differential scanning calorimetry\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation and real-world experimental considerations. The correct answer is A for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"for sufficiently low T, the electron contribution will dominate.\" The linear term (aT) represents the electronic contribution, while the cubic term (bT\u00b3) represents the phonon contribution.\n\n2. To observe the dominance of the electronic contribution, we need to go to very low temperatures where T\u00b3 becomes negligibly small compared to T. This typically occurs well below 10K, as indicated by the top answer mentioning \"under 10K, closer to 4K.\"\n\n3. To accurately measure heat capacity at such low temperatures (below 1K), specialized techniques are required:\n   - Adiabatic demagnetization is a method to reach temperatures in the millikelvin range.\n   - SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) based calorimeters offer extremely high sensitivity needed for precise measurements at these ultra-low temperatures.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are distractors that represent common misconceptions or partial understandings:\n\nB) While 10K is low, it's not low enough to clearly separate the electronic contribution. A standard helium cryostat typically doesn't go below about 4K.\n\nC) At 20-30K, the phonon contribution would likely dominate, masking the electronic contribution.\n\nD) At temperatures above 50K, the phonon contribution would completely dominate, making it impossible to accurately measure the electronic contribution.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to integrate knowledge of heat capacity contributions, temperature dependencies, and experimental techniques, requiring critical thinking about how to design an experiment to measure a specific physical phenomenon."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/23", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/94948", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/19864/"], "docs_id": 94948, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Well, the question is probably a rather basic one but I haven't been able to find the answer in literature or come up with it myself so here we go.\n\nDo there exist irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak g$ which aren't a highest weight module with respect to some Borel subalgebra in the case when\n\na) $\\\\mathfrak g$ is a complex finite dimensional semisimple algebra,\n\nb) $\\\\mathfrak g\\=\\\\mathfrak{gl}\\_n(\\\\mathbb C)$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's a more specific reference for the rank 1 simple Lie algebra; the \"classification\" by Block shows clearly how sparse the highest weight representations are among all irreducible representations [here](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1979-01-01/S0273-0979-1979-14573-7/home.html).

This situation is highly prone to overfitting, and the unexpectedly high accuracy is a red flag.\n\nOption B, implementing nested cross-validation, is the most effective approach for this scenario because:\n\n1.

Option D is the most comprehensive and accurate approach because:\n\n1. \\bookmarksetupnext{level=part} adjusts the bookmark level for the next entry, making \"Anhang\" appear at a higher level in the PDF bookmarks.\n2.

Most PSUs don't like this very much.\n\nIf you connect things wrong, a large current may flow into the PSU and fry it.\n\nAlso, the PSU will generate a voltage of 12 V, and will only be able to charge a (nominally) 12 V battery that has been discharged to below 12 V. When charging, the battery's voltage will (try to) rise very quickly to more than 12 V, and the charging will stop. At this point, very little charge will have gone into the battery and it will only be charged partially.\n\nSo, a 12 V PSU is not suited for charging (nominally) 12 V lead\\-acid batteries.

The correct answer, C, best explains the observed phenomena and highlights the primary safety concern:\n\n1. Battery reactivation: When the dry battery was filled with electrolyte (diluted battery acid), it immediately showed 12V. This suggests that the lead plates still held a residual charge, which was reactivated by the addition of the electrolyte. This is a known phenomenon in lead-acid batteries and explains the instant voltage reading.\n\n2. Uncontrolled current flow: Connecting a charged battery directly to an unprepared PSU can cause uncontrolled current flow. The PSU, designed to supply power, isn't equipped to handle incoming current from a battery. This explains why the fans started spinning when connected one way (battery powering the PSU) and why smoke appeared when connected in reverse (possibly causing a short circuit or component failure).\n\n3. Safety concern: The primary safety issue here is the risk of damaging both the battery and the PSU due to uncontrolled current flow and improper connections. PSUs are not designed to charge batteries, and this improvised setup lacks proper charge control mechanisms.\n\nThe other options contain partial truths or misconceptions:\nA) Incorrectly applies the concept of memory effect (more relevant to Ni-Cd batteries) and assumes built-in protections that aren't typically present in PSUs.\nB) Misinterprets the cause of fan movement and incorrectly suggests that smoke indicates a beneficial process.\nD) Falsely equates PSU compatibility for battery charging and misrepresents the desulfation process.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from electrical engineering and battery technology, apply them to a real-world scenario, and identify both the technical explanations and safety implications of the described actions."}, "64": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/10/16", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3868630", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/652349/"], "docs_id": 3868630, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> $\\\\text{Does }\\\\lim\\\\limits\\_{x \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{7}{x}\\\\text{ exist?}$\n\nI know that the limit doesn't exist, but don\u2019t know how to prove it.

It's not that the tension the man pulls with is tripled as such, but because of what's termed, [mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley_system) of a pulley system, **meaning that $\\\\frac{W}{3}$ of the load is shared with each one of the rope segments**.

In an ideal system, the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear. A force balance on a free body that includes the load, $W$, and $n$ supporting sections of a rope with tension $T$ yields $$nT\\-W\\=0$$\n\nmeaning that each segment of rope will handle $$T\\=\\\\frac{W}{n}\\=\\\\frac{W}{3}$$ of the load.\n\nThis is consistent with the result above where the load is given by the wieght of the plank and worker $$W\\=(M\\+m)g$$\n\nNote that the horizontal part of the rope will also have the same tension, but because it is in the horizontal direction, it does not contribute to the equation of motion (1\\)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a new pulley system for a construction site elevator.

If f is continuous at 0, then f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x) + f(0), implying f(0) = 0. Combined with the given functional property and monotonicity, this would be enough to prove the linear relationship.\n\nB) Differentiability at x = 1 would actually be sufficient. If f is differentiable at 1, it must be continuous there. The functional property then implies continuity everywhere, and we can prove f(x) = f'(1)x for all x.\n\nC) This is explicitly mentioned in the solution as a key step. Knowing f(x) = ax for all rational x, combined with monotonicity, is sufficient to extend this to all real x through a limit argument.\n\nD) This is the correct answer because boundedness on finite intervals, while a property of linear functions, is not sufficient on its own to prove f(x) = ax. Many non-linear monotonic functions (e.g., f(x) = x\u00b3) are bounded on finite intervals but do not satisfy the given functional property.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring students to evaluate which properties are truly necessary and sufficient for the proof, going beyond mere memorization of the solution steps."}, "73": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/09/22", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/191695", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/87158/"], "docs_id": 191695, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to find the maximum power on R\\_L in the following circuit.

I think there could be a problem with my approach, therefore my question is raised: When working with MOD09GA product, is supposed QC bitmask for high aerosol quantity to return 4 values?\n\nAccording to the description of the quality assessment flags, there can be 4 combinations: `'00'`, `'01'`, `'10'` and `'11'`. Thus, it should and it does return 4 values as long as they exist in the QA layer.\n\n### Details\n\nThe quality assessment (binary) flags for MOD09GA Science Data Sets are indeed detailed in [MODIS Surface Reflectance User\u2019s Guide (Collection 6\\)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/306/MOD09_User_Guide_V6.pdf). Specifically, the Data product state QA flags are described in Table 13 (the one you copy\\-pasted in your question).\n\nBreaking down the instruction\n\n```\nqcAerosol = (qc >> 6) & 3\n\n```\n\nafter the `=` sign in two parts:\n\n1. `qc >> 6` which performs a bitwise right shift of all pixel values in `qc` by 6 positions. To exemplify, let us use the unsigned 16\\-bit integer 174272\\. Its binary form is (all code below in Python):\n\n```\nbin(174272)[2:]\n'101010100011000000'\n\n```\n\nShifting this bit\\-pattern to the right by 6 positions, will result in \n\n```\nbin(174272 >> 6)[2:]\n'101010100011'\n\n```\n\nwhich is the integer\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2)\n2723\n\n```\n\nwhich, by the way, is the same as\n\n```\n174272 / 2**6\n2723\n\n```\n\nTheory says we *multiply* if we shift to the left!)\n2. `& 3` performs a bitwise AND of all shifted `qc` values with `3` which is the integer form for the binary string `'11'`. The 'AND' operation will *compare* the first two bits of each (now shifted) `qc` pixel values with `'11'`. \n\nContinuing the example with the integer `174272`, the second step is:\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2) & 3\n3\n\n```\n\nThis is expected as we *compare* the first two bits (reading from right to left) `'1010101000`**`11`**`'` with `'11'` which in turn will result to `'11'` which is the binary form of the integer `3`.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the possible *comparisons* are:\n\n\t* `'00'` AND `'11'` results in `'00'` or `0`\n\t* `'01'` AND `'11'` results in `'01'` or `1`\n\t* `'10'` AND `'11'` results in `'10'` or `2`\n\t* `'11'` AND `'11'` results in `'11'` or `3`Thus, `np.unique(qcAerosol)` can return **at most** 4 different integer values (`0` or `1` or `2` or `3`). It may, however, return less or only one according to the recorded state of the pixels for bits 7 and 6\\.\n\nAs for the other data quality states,\n\n* \"cloud state\" is a double bit, thus `2^2 = 4` states can be encoded\n* \"cloud shadow\" is a single bit, thus only `2^1 = 2` states can be encoded (`0` or `1`)\n* \"land/water\" is a triple bit, thus the possible combinations are `2^3 = 8`: `'000'` or `0`, `'001'` or `1`, `'010'` or `2`, `'011'` or `3`, `'100'` or `4`, `'101'` or 5, `'110'` or `6`, `'111'` or `7`."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided documentation about MODIS data and bit masking:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working with MOD09GA MODIS data and wants to create a mask for areas with high aerosol quantity.

The aerosol quantity information is encoded in a 2-bit field (bits 6-7), allowing for 4 possible values (0, 1, 2, 3). These values correspond to 'climatology', 'low', 'average', and 'high' aerosol quantities, respectively. \n\nTo create a binary mask for high aerosol quantity, an additional step is needed to isolate the pixels with value 3 (representing high aerosol quantity) and set them to 1, while setting all other pixels to 0. This approach correctly interprets the bit-encoded information and creates the desired binary mask.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the bitwise operation is working as intended, and reprocessing would yield the same result. Option B misinterprets the data by treating all non-zero values as high aerosol quantity, which is inaccurate. Option D incorrectly assumes the operation failed, when in fact it's producing the expected output based on the bit encoding scheme.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of bit-encoded data in remote sensing products, the interpretation of quality assessment bands, and the necessary steps to create meaningful masks from complex encodings."}, "76": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/20", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/927157", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/382774/"], "docs_id": 927157, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have 2 CentOS Web Servers with 2 different hosts\n\n* 1 is currently Live (`Server A`)\n* The 2nd will replace the first (`Server B`)\n\nOur domain currently points to `Server A`\n\nIn a normal scenario to switch between servers, we'd just simply update the DNS of the Domain to switch between servers.

Some of these were covered in the comments.\n\n* Reduce the TTL of the DNS record, several days before the move. Perform the move and then you can restore the TTL to its previous value. This does not guarantee all DNS servers in the world will have updated. You may still have some users operating off a stale DNS record. But that's what you get with DNS. It's generally good. But no guarantee. You can't even really verify as you would have to check all DNS servers of the world, many will be doing caching, some won't respect TTLs. But in generally, this is a pretty safe way to do it. Unless you have 10 million users or more, I think the potential risk is relatively low, that one of your users will be using a broken DNS server.\n* Update both servers with the latest version, then it does not matter. Say A is currently the server pointed to by DNS, update B, change DNS, update A. There is a small possible problem window during the update of A where a user will get a broken site.\n* Put a load balancer in front, which takes over the IP address DNS currently points to. This is a more complex change to your existing setup but is more how things should be generally.\n* Quickly swap the IP addresses. Give Server B the IP address of Server A and change Server A. Very short downtime \\- a couple seconds if you are ready with a script. No risks of having stale DNS since you don't change DNS.\n* Use Keepalived or similar tool. The DNS then points to a floating IP address. The server which currently has that IP would need to be given a different IP address. This is a higher complexity level than most other solutions, but it is a great improvement to your set up. Right now, you are at risk. DNS has a \"long\" TTL for the A record pointing to Server A. If Server A fails, you have to change the DNS to point to Server B which will take a long time to propagate. With a floating IP, then you never have to change the DNS. If Server A fails, Server B automatically takes over after a few milliseconds the floating IP and everything keeps on working.\n* Update Server B with new code. Switch the configuration on Server A so that instead of serving the web site, the web server proxy the requests to Server B. (Easy if its Apache httpd, NGINX, IIS. Many others should be able to do that, if not, you could put HAProxy, quickly stop the web server and start HAProxy.) At this point, all the requests are handled by Server B on the new code.

Here's why:\n\n1. It allows for instantaneous switching between servers without waiting for DNS propagation or risking stale DNS caches.\n2. It improves the overall system architecture by introducing a layer of abstraction, making future scaling and maintenance easier.\n3. It provides the ability to gradually shift traffic, enabling canary releases or A/B testing of the new platform.\n4.

customization, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Magento 2 developer is tasked with customizing the top links in the header of an e-commerce site. They need to add new links and modify existing ones while ensuring proper sorting and maintaining compatibility with the theme. Which of the following approaches would be the most effective and maintainable solution?\n\nA) Directly modify the core Magento_Customer/layout/default.xml file to add new links and change existing ones\nB) Create a new module with a custom block class extending Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Html\\Link and use layout XML to add and modify links\nC) Override the top.links block in the theme's local.xml file and hard-code the desired links\nD) Use JavaScript to dynamically inject new links into the DOM after the page loads\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective and maintainable solution is to create a new module with a custom block class and use layout XML to add and modify links (option B). This approach follows Magento 2 best practices for several reasons:\n\n1. It avoids modifying core files, which is crucial for maintainability and easier upgrades (ruling out option A).\n2. It allows for proper sorting of links using the SortLinkInterface, as demonstrated in the custom block class example.\n3. It provides flexibility to add new links and modify existing ones through layout XML, which is more maintainable than hard-coding links (ruling out option C).\n4. It leverages Magento's built-in block system and layout handling, which is more performant and reliable than using JavaScript to modify the DOM after page load (ruling out option D).\n\nThe solution involves creating a new module (e.g., Abhishek_Toplink), defining a custom block class that extends Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Html\\Link and implements SortLinkInterface, and using layout XML to reference and modify the top.links block. This approach allows for adding new links (like \"My Orders\" and \"My Quotes\") and modifying existing ones (like changing labels or sort order) in a way that integrates seamlessly with Magento's architecture and can be easily maintained or extended in the future."}, "78": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/09", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/128684", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/61246/"], "docs_id": 128684, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From the answers I updated the question: \n\nNow, it's: \n\n```\n$ date \"+%F %H:%M\"\n2014-06-04 11:26\n\n```\n\nThis is the input: \n\n```\n$ cat input.txt \n<tr><td>2014-04-24 14:01</td><td>2014-06-04 11:30</td><td>2014-06-04 11:23</td></tr>\n\n```\n\nThis is the current perl script (that is working GREAT!, only hours/minutes missing)\n\n```\n$ cat a.txt \nperl -MTime::Piece -pe '\n    BEGIN {$today = localtime->ymd}\n    @days = $_ =~ /<td>(.+?)<\\/td>/g;\n    for $d (@days) {\n      $_ =~ s!$d!<font style=BACKGROUND-COLOR:red>$d</font>!g if $d lt $today;\n      }' input.txt\n\n```\n\nAnd now, it produces this output: \n\n```\n$ bash a.txt \n<tr><td><font style=BACKGROUND-COLOR:red>2014-04-24 14:01</font></td><td>2014-06-04 11:30</td><td>2014-06-04 11:23</td></tr>\n\n```\n\n**Our question**: How can we mark the past dates \\- the hours:minutes too! \\- as red?

I have a couple of hundred shapes to add to a FeatureClass.\n\nI'm trying to find a way to \"predefine\" a polygon, like a square of 10m by 20m, and then \"paste\" that shape at the hundreds of lat/long co\\-ordinates I have.\n\nIt seems that I have to start from the specified lat/long, and calculate and draw the shape around that point.\n\nIs there not a way to \"paste\" a shape?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's a great deal of information theory embedded in the management of GIS service queues. Much of it involves ugly math (summations involving exponential functions). I'm going to try to distill the theory to basics, then apply it to your question.\n\nFirst off we need some definitions:\n\n* Service \\- A general class of resource that provides work\n* Instance \\- An individual worker for a service\n* Pool \\- The number of available workers\n* Request \\- A work unit that needs servicing\n* Queue \\- The ordered list of requests awaiting servicing\n* Job \\- A request being actively serviced by a service instance\n* Runtime \\- The time is takes for an instance to service a job\n* Limit \\- A resource constraint on an instance that can place a ceiling on runtime\n* Exception \\- A failure in the processing of the request\n\nNow to put them into common context:\n\nYou're due to fly out on an international flight. You have baggage and an economy ticket. You locate your airline, and join the group of folks waiting to check in. There are three slightly harried airline representatives beyond the eight people ahead of you, and two of the three have customers they're already checking in. As you wait, you notice that customers leave the front at an average of one minute per person, plus 45 seconds for each checked bag.\n\nUnder this content, when you first arrived you have a service (airline check\\-in) with three server instances (pool size three), eleven requests, with queue length nine, two active jobs, and a runtime proportional to the number of seats *plus* bags.\n\nThere are ways to speed you on your way:\n\n* The airline could hire a dozen more check\\-in specialists. This would provide more instances, and therefore more completed jobs per unit time. But the extra salary would increase costs to the point that fares tripled, and your holiday might fall victim.\n* The airline could limit two persons and three bags per job (which would also yield also more jobs/time) but you probably want to keep both your spouse and infant daughter on the flight with you (getting kicked out of the line would be a service exception, as would still being in the queue when your flight announced final boarding).\n\nLet's say that there just happens to be an additional check\\-in specialist, who was on break. This individual walks up to an open podium, logs in with two\\-factor authentication, flips some switches to make the light turn on, and calls to the next person in line. Now you've experienced service pooling \\-\\- the worker was available, but it took a bit to spin up to become an instance.\n\nIn the GIS realm, the same principles can be applied, but let's describe the system based on the load you've described (assuming a one\\-min, two\\-max service list defaults):\n\nYou are running an airport with 100 airlines and 100 two\\-position check\\-in terminals, with 100 representatives at lit check\\-in stations, and 100 extra staffers in the back room to take on additional work (one per airline). We don't know how often a flyer comes in, or to which airline, or whether any representatives are busy, or how profitable the airport is that it can afford to have so many workers sitting around waiting for not enough customers. We do know that planes are leaving without passengers on occasion.\n\nWould increasing the number of back\\-room staffers for one airline help prevent unhappy flyers? Well, maybe for that one airline, but in the context of the airport, probably not.\n\nWhat you need to do is:\n\n* Identify which services are consistently busy, and which are usually idle\n* Reduce minimum pool from those that are often idle\n* Add maximum pool size to the busiest services, highest queue length first (but add slowly, no more than half the backlog at a time; workers are expensive)\n* If requests to certain servers are of short duration, and extremely bursty, it might make sense to increase the minimum number of instances, to reduce the latency of spinning up pooled instances\n* Review and repeat as necessary\n\nIn the end, you only have so many resources, and it's not clear what the error might be. An expensive way to find out if your error is due to resource exhaustion is to double the capacity of the server (2x CPU and/or 2x RAM), or double the number of servers (the latter increases overhead cost, due to additional communication, but also provides a means to continue servicing during maintenance windows). The less expensive options all involve more work, since you'd need to do some research into queuing theory and review the practical aspects of your deployment in light of this theory. In between might be a short\\-term consult from a expert to review your configuration and make recommendations."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A GIS analyst is tasked with optimizing the performance of a FeatureClass service that processes hundreds of polygon shapes. The service is experiencing delays and occasional timeouts.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the key principles outlined for optimizing service performance:\n\n1. \"Identify which services are consistently busy, and which are usually idle\"\n2. \"Reduce minimum pool from those that are often idle\"\n3. \"Add maximum pool size to the busiest services, highest queue length first (but add slowly, no more than half the backlog at a time; workers are expensive)\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because increasing minimum pool size for all services would be inefficient, especially for idle services. Option B, while mentioned as a possible solution, is described as \"expensive\" and not the most targeted approach. Option D introduces an arbitrary limit that wasn't suggested in the documentation and might negatively impact service quality.\n\nThe correct approach balances resource allocation, targets specific performance issues, and allows for gradual optimization. This solution requires understanding the concepts of service instances, pools, queues, and how they interact in a GIS context, demonstrating application of the information to a real-world scenario."}, "81": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/29", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/691707", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/450285/"], "docs_id": 691707, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've tried to install a new system with the help of a [mini.iso](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) and ran into wireless configuration issues. \nI found it pretty weird that the mini.iso mostly seems to be working fine although despite pretty basic commands like the following:\n\n```\nlshw\nlspci\nlsusb\nifconfig\n\n```\n\nwere missing when I tried them from the command line.\n\nThis is the extended version of my question: \n\n* Which commands are available on the mini.iso?\n* Where can I find documentation about the available console commands?\n* Where can I find what software packages are present on the mini.iso?\n\n---\n\n**Update:** (clarification about the question)\n\nTo be clear about the question: with \"command line\" I mean the console that becomes available when you \n\n* perform \"manual\" configuration steps during setup (like wireless, disk, serial device setup) or\n* when you access the menu point \"Execute a shell\"\n\nThe question is specific about the `mini.iso` or `netinstall.iso` as these are provided seemingly without further documentation.

Option A, while seemingly logical, actually removes the default template that interprets the `bg` color setting, as explained in the documentation. Option B is a more complex solution than necessary for this scenario. Option D uses a different command not mentioned in the documentation and may not fully reset the template.\n\nThe correct answer, C, addresses the root cause of the issue. By using `\\setbeamertemplate{background canvas}{default}`, we restore the default template that includes the code for interpreting the `bg` color setting:\n\n```\n\\defbeamertemplate*{background canvas}{default}\n{%\n  \\ifbeamercolorempty[bg]{background canvas}{}{\\color{bg}\\vrule width\\paperwidth height\\paperheight}%\n}\n```\n\nThis approach resets the background canvas to its default state, which includes the mechanism for applying background colors set with `\\setbeamercolor`.

See pages 260\\-266 of Pinheiro/Bates.\n\nA good first step is to make a variogram to see how the correlation depends on distance.\n\n```\nlibrary(nlme)\nm0 <- gls(response ~ level, data = layout)  \nplot(Variogram(m0, form=~x+y))\n\n```\n\nHere the sample semivariogram increases with distance indicating that the observations are indeed spatially correlated.\n\nOne option for the correlation structure is a spherical structure; that could be modeled in the following way.\n\n```\nm1 <- update(m0, corr=corSpher(c(15, 0.25), form=~x+y, nugget=TRUE))\n\n```\n\nThis model does seem to fit better than the model with no correlation structure, though it's entirely possible it too could be improved on with one of the other possible correlation structures.\n\n```\n> anova(m0, m1)\n   Model df     AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\nm0     1  3 46.5297 49.80283 -20.26485                        \nm1     2  5 43.3244 48.77961 -16.66220 1 vs 2 7.205301  0.0273\n\n```\n\n2\\) You could also try including `x` and `y` directly in the model; this could be appropriate if the pattern of correlation depends on more than just distance. In your case (looking at sesqu's pictures) it seems that for this block anyway, you may have a diagonal pattern.\n\nHere I'm updating the original model instead of m0 because I'm only changing the fixed effects, so the models should both be fit using maximum likelihood.\n\n```\n> model2 <- update(model, .~.+x*y)\n> anova(model, model2)\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: response ~ level\nModel 2: response ~ level + x + y + x:y\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F   Pr(>F)   \n1     22 5.3809                                \n2     19 2.7268  3    2.6541 6.1646 0.004168 **\n\n```\n\nTo compare all three models, you'd need to fit them all with `gls` and the maximum likelihood method instead of the default method of REML.\n\n```\n> m0b <- update(m0, method=\"ML\")\n> m1b <- update(m1, method=\"ML\")\n> m2b <- update(m0b, .~x*y)\n> anova(m0b, m1b, m2b, test=FALSE)\n    Model df      AIC      BIC     logLik\nm0b     1  3 38.22422 41.75838 -16.112112\nm1b     2  5 35.88922 41.77949 -12.944610\nm2b     3  5 29.09821 34.98847  -9.549103\n\n```\n\nRemember that especially with your knowledge of the study, you might be able to come up with a model that is better than any of these.

Let's say I get a \"NORCO RPC\\-4020 4U Rackmount Server Case\" (Newegg Item\\#:N82E16811219021\\) and three [LSI LSI00151 PCI Express SATA / SAS Eight\\-Port Host Bus Adapter](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816118092), is the performance going to be noticeably better or worst than if I get this \"SUPERMICRO CSE\\-846TQ\\-R900B Black 4U Rackmount Server Case w/ 900W Redundant Power Supply\" (Newegg Item\\#:N82E16811152124\\) and only one of the LSI adapters. I will probably start out with 8 2TB SATA hard drives and add them 8 at a time.\n\nThe Supermicro looks like it has a much better build, and it has redundant power supplies, but it has a SC846 SAS Backplane w/AMI MG9072 Chip which I'm not sure if it will help or hurt performance compared to connecting each drive separately.\n\nThe costs seem to equal out either way I go. Currently my online storage is about 6TB and constantly growing. Right now, they're all connected to my computer directly so it's still pretty fast to search, so going to a NAS device, I'm trying to not lose much performance.\n\nI'm also up for any suggestions relating to this.\n\n(It appears I'm only allowed to make one link, but I included Newegg Part numbers so it's easy to see what equipment I'm looking at.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I built a similar configuration for my photography work. I went with a cheaper solution, but am also using OpenSolaris and ZFS.\n\nIn summary, even with modest disks (just a mirrored zpool of low\\-power drives) it's pretty much as fast as having local disks in a workstation. The bigger factor was getting quality Gigabit adapters and a good switch (The initial Netgear switch I used was a piece of garbage).\n\nRemember that even with GigE, your max theoretical throughput is 128 MB/s over the wire, but realistically you'll likely get about 80% of that after you factor in a variety of overheads. Even on my cheap disks in a simple mirror I can get 75 MB/s sustained throughput. In a RAID\\-Z2 configuration with 8 disks you should be able to saturate the GigE link without any problem."}, "answer": "Question: A professional photographer is planning to build a NAS server for archiving their work, considering two different setups.

I am going by the procedure outlined in the 5th slide of this presentation <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/teaching/09mlss/slides.pdf>\n\nI understand the preliminary steps. Pi is equal to 4 times the area of a quarter of the unit circle. And the area of the top\\-right quarter of the unit circle centered at (0,0\\) is equivalent to the integral of the curve that is the top\\-right quarter of the unit circle in $0\\<x\\<1$ and $0\\<y\\<1$. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how this integral is\n\n$\\\\iint I((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\)P(x,y)dxdy$\n\nwhere $P(x,y)$ is uniformly distributed in the unit square around the quarter circle (i.e. it is always equal to 1 if $0\\<x\\<1$ and $0\\<y\\<1$ and 0 otherwise). So this would mean that\n $I((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\)P(x,y)$  \n\nis the function that is the top\\-right quadrant of the unit circle at $0\\<x\\<1$ and $0\\<y\\<1$ but I do not understand how this is true since the indicator function can only be 1 or 0\\. I understand that it is probably written in this way to make Monte Carlo sampling easy (i.e. it is an expectation so just sample from $P(x,y)$ and get the average of the samples applied to $I((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\)$) but it just does not make intuitive sense to me why that integral represents the area under that curve.\n\nCould someone provide an intuitive explanation of this. Maybe show how that integral was derived in a step\\-by\\-step way?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI was able to gain a better understanding by relating the expectation to an area. I will explain it here in case it helps anyone. First start with relating Pi to the area of the top\\-right quadrant of the unit circle\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times A\\_{tr}$\n\nThen we place the top\\-right quadrant into the unit square. And under a uniform distribution over the unit square, the area of the circle quadrant is proportional to the probability of obtaining a sample from it. It follows that the following equality holds\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=\\\\frac{A\\_{tr}}{A\\_{square}}$\n\nand $A\\_{square}\\=1$ so\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=A\\_{tr}$\n\nAnd substituting into the original equation\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)$\n\nand it is also true that $P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=E\\[I(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)]$ which is equal to the original double integral.\n\nSo I understood it by relating the area to a probability then relating that probability to an expectation that is equivalent to the integral. Let me know if I have made any mistakes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The area of a circle circle of radius $l$ is equal to $\\\\pi l^2$. It means that a quarter of circle has area $l^2\\\\pi/4$. This means that the square with side the radius of the circle as $area\\=l^2$. \n\nThis means that the ratio between the area of a quarter of circle and the area of the square is $\\\\pi/4$. \n\nA point $(x,y) $ is in the square if $ 0\\<x\\<1, 0\\<y\\<1$. \nand it is in the quarter of circle if $ 0\\<x\\<1, 0\\<y\\<1 ,x^2\\+y^2\\<1$. \n\nYour integral is so $\u222cI((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\)P(x,y)\\= \u222cI((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\) I(0\\<x\\<1\\)I(0\\<y\\<1\\)$ That is exactly the area described by a quarter of circle\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wh7mG.gif)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Monte Carlo integration for estimating Pi, here's a challenging question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is explaining Monte Carlo integration for estimating Pi to a group of students.

Please do suggest. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me suggest a different point of view. It is crucial that symmetry operators acting on a Hilbert space be unitary by the very definition of what a symmetry is. Thus, we expect that the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional. This is already the case in the Klein Gordon field, whose corresponding Hilbert space is a Fock space built from a $1$\\-particle Hilbert space spanned by states of definite momentum $\\|p\\\\rangle$.\n\nThe fields on the other hand, are built so that they transform as $\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x))$, with $D$ a finite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group. For example, in the case of Klein\\-Gordon, the field takes values in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and the representation is given by $D(\\\\Lambda)\\=1\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. As you mentioned, this representation cannot be unitary. However, what does unitarity mean hear? For this concept to make sense we need to equip the vector space where our field takes values with an inner product. Thus, the fact is that there is no inner product on this vector space which makes $D$ a unitary representation. That is ok though! In quantum field theory our fields describe operators, not states. There is no meaning to an inner product structure to the operators in a quantum system (well, there is but it is more subtle, see GNS representation). \n\nWhat is the relationship then between $D$ and the unitary representation $U$ on our Hilbert space? Well, precisely that they are compatible\n$$U(\\\\Lambda)^\\\\dagger\\\\phi(x)U(\\\\Lambda)\\=\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x)).$$\n\nI hope this was useful :)"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a high-quality multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A quantum field theorist is explaining the relationship between field transformations and Hilbert space representations to a group of graduate students.

The correct answer, C, captures the key relationship explained in the text. \n\nThe documentation emphasizes that fields transform under a finite-dimensional representation D(\u039b), which is generally non-unitary. In contrast, symmetry operators on the Hilbert space must be unitary. The crucial point is that these two types of transformations are compatible but distinct, as expressed in the equation:\n\nU(\u039b)\u2020\u03c6(x)U(\u039b) = \u03c6\u0303(x) = D(\u039b)(\u03c6(\u039b\u207b\u00b9x))\n\nThis compatibility allows the theory to maintain consistency between field transformations and the underlying quantum states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that fields and Hilbert space states transform in the same way, which is not true. Fields transform under D(\u039b), while states transform under the unitary U(\u039b).\n\nOption B is a distractor that confuses the unitarity requirement for Hilbert space operators with field transformations.

Option A addresses both aspects:\n\n1. Fixing the syntax: The code should use `request.form[\"comment\" + id]` instead of `request.form[\"comment\" & id]`. The `+` operator is used for string concatenation in Python, not `&`.\n\n2. Input validation: It's crucial to implement server-side validation to ensure the received data is safe and meets expected formats. This helps prevent injection attacks and ensures data integrity.\n\n3. Robustness: Using `request.form.get(\"comment\" + id, default_value)` would be even more robust, as it prevents KeyError exceptions if the expected key is missing.\n\n4. Maintaining current structure: This solution requires minimal changes to the existing code structure, making it easier to implement and less prone to introducing new bugs.\n\nOption B is incorrect because changing to a static name would not work with multiple comments.

For example, without every chunk, you don't know how many chunks there are, unless something upstream counted them and told you. You don't have to count them if the meta data tells you how many there are.\n\nThat may be a trivial example, but formats and even transmission protocols have been devised specifically to solve this exact problem. You can only work with what you have.\n\nWhen people use the word \u201cstreaming\u201d they're usually talking about transmission over the network, but it's the same problem when parsing a file from the hard drive. You can load the entire file into memory (sometimes called [slurping](https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/07/10/ruby-magic-slurping-and-streaming-files.html) or [batch processing](https://www.precisely.com/blog/big-data/big-data-101-batch-process-streams)) or you can load a line/chunk at a time (effectively streaming). Which one is appropriate depends on the size of the file, size of the memory, and your parsing/processing needs.\n\nIf you don't mind looking at a few lines of Ruby code, I recommend referring to the comparison of performance metrics in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25189286/1493294).

Given the troubleshooting steps already taken and the unusual solution proposed, what is the most likely underlying cause of this problem?\n\nA) A timing issue between the kernel's USB driver initialization and the keyboard detection process\nB) Incompatibility between the AMD FM2 board's BIOS and the Ubuntu Server 16.04 installer\nC) Corrupt installation media despite passing MD5 verification\nD) A hardware fault in multiple USB ports on the motherboard\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause is a timing issue between the kernel's USB driver initialization and the keyboard detection process. This conclusion is supported by several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The problem occurs consistently at a specific point in the installation process (after language selection), suggesting a systematic issue rather than random hardware failure.\n\n2. The keyboard works fine in the initial selection screen and with the Ubuntu Desktop installer, indicating that the hardware itself is functional.\n\n3. The proposed solution of \"pressing random keys at a rate of approximately two per second\" until the next screen appears suggests that the issue is related to timing and detection, rather than a fundamental incompatibility or hardware fault.\n\n4. The problem persists across multiple keyboards and USB ports, ruling out a specific hardware failure.\n\n5. The issue doesn't occur in a virtual machine environment, which typically has different timing characteristics for device initialization.\n\nThis type of timing-related issue could occur if the kernel's USB driver isn't fully initialized when the installer attempts to detect and configure the keyboard. By continuously sending keystrokes, the user essentially gives the system more opportunities to detect the keyboard once the driver is ready, allowing the installation to proceed.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are less likely because they don't align with all the observed behaviors and troubleshooting steps taken. The BIOS compatibility issue (B) would likely cause problems earlier in the boot process. A corrupt installation media (C) is unlikely given the MD5 verification and successful virtual machine installation.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The statement \"\u0304v injective \u2200N \u21d2 v surjective\" implies that if the dual map is injective for all possible codomains, then the original map must be surjective.\n\n2.
