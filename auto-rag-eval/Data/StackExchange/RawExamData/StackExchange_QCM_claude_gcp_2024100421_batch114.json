When a CM collected stats for us in 2014, [2\\.1% of our posts had *more than 50 comments*](https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2780/325). That's absurd, and the problem has continued. Moderators spend way too much time dealing with comments and flags on comments and complaints on meta about deleted comments and sniping about comments in *other* comments... for a second\\-class feature, comments sure do cause a lot of work. We haven't been able to [bring about a cultural change](https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/964/83) yet; can we add some friction?\n\nThe answer isn't to *prevent* comments because, while some people love to use comments for tangents, arguments, jokes, and long\\-winded discussions, comments *do* still serve a purpose. We *also* get the good kind, the ones that seek clarification or otherwise try to improve a post. And that's why we don't just purge threads wholesale; we need to preserve those ones if they're not yet obsolete. We want the good comments; we just want fewer of the others.\n\nInstead of cleaning up the problems afterward, it would be great if we had some way to *impede some of those comment explosions in the first place*, on sites where this is a problem. How can we do that? I can think of a few possibilities:\n\n1. Lower the number of comments needed before you get the \"let's continue this in chat\" suggestion. This currently happens if two users have posted three comments each, so there's not a lot of room to improve this. I see two downsides: (a) people can ignore that prompt (unless we change that), and (b) this does nothing for threads involving several people.\n2. Have something like protection that restricts commenting. This would allow moderators (or the community, preferably) to prevent drive\\-by comments on posts that are getting a lot of activity. Like protection, it should require a certain amount of reputation *on this site* to be able to comment. This helps with Hot Network Questions but might not make much of a dent otherwise.\n3. When comment rate reaches a certain threshold (N comments/hour), temporarily prevent further comments (for some number of hours) \\-\\- maybe from everybody, or maybe just from people who've commented more than M times already. The idea of rate\\-sensitive commenting limits is attractive, but I'm unsure about how it should work.\n\nWould any of these work? What else could be done to address this problem? (I now see that I made a couple more [quasi\\-suggestions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/260701/162102) elsewhere a while back.)\n\nThis question arises from one site, but I've seen comment explosions that could benefit from some throttling on other sites too, so it's not *only* one site's problem. I'm looking for something that sites could opt into, not something that would be mandatory across all of SE.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An idea that combines \\#1 and \\#3 (since you asked for further suggestions): limit each person to 3 (or perhaps 2\\) undeleted comments on a post at any time, except for the poster. That cuts off long discussion threads in their early stages, without much limiting the ability to request clarifications or suggest improvements: when the poster responds to your comment, you can delete it, which frees up a \"slot\" for you to make another suggestion.\n\nThis doesn't solve the whole problem, of course; there are still cases where a whole lot of people contribute to a discussion and you get 15 or 20 comments without more than 3 being from any one person. The door is still open for some other measure to address that case. It is also possible that two people can keep a rotating buffer of the last 4 or 6 messages of their ongoing discussion, but at that point it just seems silly not to move to chat, and honestly, if they're deleting their comments as they go is it really *that* bad?\n\n---\n\nPersonally, I would also be in favor of automatically deleting (almost) all comments after a week, but I think it's been established that I'm in the minority there."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A popular Q&A website is experiencing issues with excessive commenting on posts.

It prevents any single user from dominating the comment section, encourages more thoughtful and concise feedback, and naturally limits extended back-and-forth conversations. This solution maintains the ability to seek clarification or suggest improvements, as users can delete their own comments to make room for new ones if needed.\n\nOption A is too extreme and would eliminate all comments, including valuable ones. Option C is arbitrary and could prevent important interactions on popular or controversial posts. Option D may help in some cases but doesn't address situations involving multiple users or those who ignore the chat suggestion.\n\nThe correct answer (B) provides a balanced approach that adds friction to excessive commenting while preserving the useful aspects of the feature, aligning with the goal of reducing moderator workload and improving overall site quality."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/29", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/196708", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/86156/"], "docs_id": 196708, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is more fuel efficient: Two identical cars running at 50mph or one being tied to the other and only the first dragging both at 50mph?

Now one engine is delivering about twice as much torque and was probably not designed for that. An engine specifically designed to deliver more torque would like be more efficient than the two combined.\n\nLets look torque alone. Ignore the tow rope and assume the second is far enough back to not get any draft. In this case wind resistance is the same \\- shape, size, and speed of the car is the same. Rolling resistance would most likely be more in the tow. Rolling resistance goes up with torque and has a sweet spot. Years ago motor trend was testing an Audi Quatro and to the test the resistance of the front transfer box they disconnected the drive shaft and got a lower top speed.

The documentation mentions that \"an engine specifically designed to deliver more torque would likely be more efficient than the two combined.\" This suggests that the efficiency of the towing scenario is contingent on the engine's capabilities rather than being universally more or less efficient than two separate cars. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes separate cars are always more efficient, which isn't necessarily true. Option B oversimplifies the situation by only considering fuel consumption without accounting for increased engine strain.

And say also that \"do your stuff\" might throw an exception. The RAII way of doing that would be to make a class whose ctor set the cursor to wait, whose one \"real\" method did whatever it was you wanted done, and whose dtor set the cursor back. Resources (in this case the cursor state) are tied to the scope of an object. When you acquire the resource you initialize an object. You can count on the object getting destructed if exceptions are thrown, and that means you can count on getting to clean up the resource.\n\nUsing RAII well means you don't need `finally`.

But Energy and Mass are the same thing, so does that mean a closed system is the same as an open system (a system in which both mass and energy can be exchanged)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ensembles in thermodynamics are defined in terms of quantities that are conserved between the system and the bath. Typically, that means energy $E$ and particle number (mass) $N$. However, this needs to be modified to account for relativity. To say that your system can only gain or lose a particle by exchanging it with the bath is necessarily declaring it to be non\\-relativistic. Let's go through the three ensembles.\n\n1. The **microcanonical ensemble** says that nothing can leave the system. The available microstates are therefore the ones that have the fixed energy $E$. Knowing that each one has probability $e^{\\-S}$ allows you to derive Boltzmann's formula.\n2. The **canonical ensemble** says that energy is the only conserved quantity that can leave the system and it does until the system and bath are at the same temperature. Now the probability of a microstate $e^{\\-S}$ is most usefully expressed using $F \\= E \\- TS$ which is the quantity that will be minimized in equilibrium. Note that other things besides energy can leave the system too as long as they are not conserved. Total velocity in the $x$ direction would be an example.\n3. If particle number is a conserved quantity, you can also have the **grand canonical ensemble**. Now particles are exchanged to get a constant chemical potential and $e^{\\-S}$ involves the grand potential $\\\\Omega \\= E \\- TS \\- \\\\mu N$.\n\nWhen you have all three, the systems are described as isolated, closed and open respectively. If you can only define the first two ensembles, I don't know whether it's best to call them (isolated, closed), (isolated, open) or (closed, open). However it's worth noting that several applications, such as electron gases, have a microscopic notion of charge.

But in quantum mechanics (the Copenhagen interpretation), I\u2019ve heard that a particle will exist in (*superposition* of being in) multiple places at once until it is observed and the wave function collapses and it has a single position. \n\nSo my question is, how could these two viewpoints be reconciled? Apologies if I got anything wrong. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two problems here, one on the quantum mechanical side and one on the relativistic side.\n\nInterpreting quantum mechanics\n------------------------------\n\nFirst, you seem to be imagining that quantum particles \"really\" are classical, with well\\-defined trajectories which we simply can't measure because of the uncertainty principle. That is, you treat quantum mechanics as just classical mechanics viewed through a smudged lens. That is not a good way of thinking about it: nature is *much* weirder than that. (I try to give a better explanation [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/421919/quantum-made-easy-so-what-is-quantum-mechanics-all-about/421939#421939).)\n\nTo avoid confusion, you should refrain from using phrases such as \"the *actual* position of the particle\" or \"the path the particle took\". Imagine trying to explain to a blind person how a screen's color is fading from white to black, and them asking \"okay, but was it *actually* black or white right in the middle?\" It's just not a valid question; there is no answer.\n\nIn the modern formulation of relativistic quantum field theory, we define quantum fields on all of spacetime $\\\\phi(t, \\\\mathbf{x})$. So the quantum field can be defined for all times from the get go, but this does *not* mean that it represents a definite number of particles doing definite trajectories, any more than a screen having a color at any time means it's always either black or white. \n\nInterpreting relativity\n-----------------------\n\nThe second problem is with the interpretation of relativity. I think you're alluding to Putnam's [block universe argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rietdijk%E2%80%93Putnam_argument). The argument is essentially that, since things that will occur in the future in my frame have already occurred in somebody else's frame, due to [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity), the future must \"already\" \"exist\", so it must be predetermined. However, one shouldn't confuse the mathematical formalism of a theory, i.e. the easiest way to set it up, with its ontology, i.e. what it states about reality.\n\nSome summarize this by saying \"the map is not the territory\". If you have a road map with a grid of latitude and longitude lines, that does not mean the real ground is covered in giant lines. The lines were just drawn to make the map more useful. Not everything on the map reflects reality.\n\nSimilarly, relativity pushes us to set up calculations so that everything is already defined for all times, but this is not necessary. For example, in the [ADM/3\\+1 formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism) of general relativity, things are specified only at a single time, then propagated forward in time. So in this map, the future does not exist, only the present. This is essential for numerical simulations, because how would you have a computer compute the future if it had to know it already?\n\nThe point is that there are multiple ways to set up relativity, and all of them have different features. Since they all make the same concrete predictions, science can't choose one. (This is why I get annoyed at grand statements about how relativity tells us what spacetime *really is*, when it's really just a feature of the one map the speaker has used.)\n\nIf you insist on a *particular* interpretation of relativity (the block universe) and a *particular* interpretation of quantum mechanics (Copenhagen), then there is indeed a contradiction, because the Copenhagen interpretation requires an indeterminate future. But that doesn't mean the underlying theories contradict each other, it only means that these two particular ways of talking about them don't mesh; you'll need to swap out one or the other.

The 4\\-divergence\n$$s\\~:\\=\\~d\\_{\\\\mu}J^{\\\\mu}\\\\tag{1}$$\nis then a Lorentz scalar.\n4. The global conservation law (\\=conservation law in integral form) states that the charge $$Q(t)\\~:\\=\\~\\\\int\\_{\\\\mathbb{R^3}}\\\\! \\\\mathrm{d}^3r\\~\\\\rho({\\\\bf r},t)\\\\tag{2}$$ is conserved: $$\\\\frac{dQ}{dt}\\~\\=\\~0\\.\\\\tag{3}$$\n5.

The [projection/central/Fourier slice theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-slice_theorem)$^1$ then implies that the Fourier transform $\\\\hat{s}$ vanishes for time\\-like 4\\-wave\\-vectors:\n$$\\|{\\\\bf k}\\|\\~\\<\\~\\|\\\\omega\\| \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad \\\\hat{s}({\\\\bf k},\\\\omega)\\~\\=\\~0\\. \\\\tag{5}$$\n7. On the other hand, we assume that the matter $J^{\\\\mu}$ obeys causality, i.e. that the Fourier transform $\\\\hat{J}^{\\\\mu}$ only has support inside the time\\-like light\\-cone $\\|{\\\\bf k}\\|\\<\\|\\\\omega\\|$.\n8.

Now let's take a cross sectional area $A$. Forces as stated are applied over this whole area. We know pressure is force applied per unit area. So by definition it would be $P\\=\\\\frac{F}{A}$. But here the forces which are acting on the cross sectional area are all same. I mean the same magnitude of forces are being applied on the area. So even if we take a unit area,that same force $F$ is being applied there,but by definition of pressure the force applied on a unit area should be $\\\\frac{F}{A}$ whereas wherever we look at(no matter how large the area is),the same force $F$ is being applied. This is really contradictory(i know i am surely being wrong but i need to know where).\n\nOr are the forces $F$ all added?I mean for example let's suppose $10$ vectors $F$ are being applied on area $A$. In that case for a unit area,obviously the number of vectors will be less than $10$,let's say $5$ (even though the magnitude is still same). Then will we take total force on $A$ as $10\\\\times F$ and the unit area as $5\\\\times F$? I am really confused.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In your diagram, there are four distinct, for want of a better term, \"pressure points\", one for each of the four applied forces. If each of the forces were actually acting at a point, the pressure exerted by each force would be infinite because a \"point\" has zero area.\n\nIn reality, all forces act on some finite area, even if small. For pressure due to physical contact forces, you need to divide the force by the area over which the contact force is acting. For example, if a book is placed on a table it exerts a pressure at the surface of the table equal to its weight divided by the area of contact with the table, not the total area of the table.\n\nOn the other hand, if we are interested in the mechanical stresses and deformation within a deformable material under the area A due to the four forces, they will be distributed in some fashion throughout the material below the surface, due to the lateral stresses produced by the local forces, being a maximum directly below the application areas, dropping to a minimum between the application areas.\n\n> could you verify if what jensen paull in his last comment about 4\n> was right in reply to my post? Also as you mentioned,since force can't\n> act on a point, could you please illustrate with a picture where a\n> single force is being on an area?That would clear my doubts.\n\nI agree with @jensen paull that if the total force applied to the area A is $Mg$ then the force applied at each of the four \"locations\" is $Mg/4$, provided that the total force is evenly distributed to the four locations.\n\nI can't say if that answered your post because, with statements like, \"let's suppose 10 vectors are being applied on area $A$\", it appears you continue to confuse the depiction of forces by vectors, which are simply geometric objects, with the actual forces themselves. I believe that, in turn, has you confused about the pressures associated with forces.\n\nBut you have asked me to illustrate the concepts with a picture, so I will. Your diagram shows four vectors which I assume are intended to depict four forces that are applied to four locations within the area $A$. A physical example are the forces that the four legs of the table in the figure below, with a book on top, would exert on the floor below. The figure shows the forces the book applies to the table, and the book plus table applies to the floor, as well as the reaction $R$ forces of the table and floor.\n\nIf the four legs are symmetrically located around the center of mass of the book, $m$ plus the mass of the table $M$ (which includes the legs), the magnitude of the force $F\\_{B\\+T}$ exerted by each leg would be\n\n$$F\\_{B\\+T}\\=\\\\frac{(m\\+M)g}{4}$$\n\nNow, the magnitude of the pressure that each leg exerts on the floor is equal to the force exerted by each leg divided by the *surface area of contact* between the leg and the floor, which would be the cross sectional area $a\\_{L}$ of a leg with a flat bottom, or\n\n$$P\\_{B\\+T}\\=\\\\frac{(m\\+M)g}{4a\\_{L}}$$\n\nI have emphasized \"surface area of contact\" because in your diagram that is only the part of A that is in contact with the legs, not the entire floor area A. You can think of the surface area of contact as the \"footprint\" of the legs on the floor.\n\nNow let's turn our attention to the book on top of the table. It exerts a pressure on the table\n\n$$P\\=\\\\frac{mg}{a\\_{B}}$$\n\nWhere $a\\_{B}$ is the area of contact between the book and the table, not the total surface area of the table.\n\nFor both the book and the table leg the force that is applied is in actuality distributed over the surface area of contact.\n\nFor example, let the density ($N/m^3$) of the book be $\\\\rho$. An infinitesimal volume of the book of $dV\\=(dl)(dw)(dh)$ where $dl,dw,dh$ are infinitesimal amounts of length, width, and height of the book, will exert a infinitesimal amount of force on the table of\n\n$$dF\\_{B}\\=g\\\\rho dV$$\n\nTo get the total force exerted by the book on the table we integrate (sum up) all the infinitesimal forces\n\n$$F\\_{B}\\=\\\\int\\_V dF\\_{B}\\=\\\\int\\_V g\\\\rho dV$$\n\nif the density of the book is uniform (constant) over its volume we have\n\n$$F\\_{B}\\=\\\\rho g \\\\int\\_V dV\\=\\\\rho V g\\=mg$$\n\nThe same would apply to each leg, with the total mass being $m\\+M$.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2R7GK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2R7GK.jpg)"}, "answer": "Based on the information provided, here's a multi-form question suitable for an exam:\n\nQuestion: A rectangular table with mass M and four identical legs supports a book of mass m at its center.

Each leg bears 1/4 of the total weight (m+M)g, and this force is distributed over the cross-sectional area aL of each leg. Therefore, the pressure at each contact point is (m+M)g/(4aL).

It could mean either of the following:\n\n* > I am interested in the concept of nothingness.\n* > I am not interested in anything.\n\nNote that in the first case, \u201cnothing\u201d here actually is a \u201csomething\u201d in the context of \u201cshowing curiosity or concern about something,\u201d since it\u2019s being used as shorthand for \u201cthe concept of nothingness.\u201d The English word \u201cnothing\u201d can have that meaning.\n\nIn the second case, this is a **very** common usage of the word \u201cnothing\u201d in the English language\u2014much more common than the first. English speakers very often say \u201cX nothing\u201d rather than \u201cnot X anything,\u201d where X is some verb. \u201cHe saw nothing,\u201d \u201cshe said nothing,\u201d \u201cI got nothing,\u201d \u201cTouch nothing,\u201d and so on are all very common statements. In a sense, \u201cnothing\u201d here is being used almost literally as \u201cno thing,\u201d and the negation in \u201cno thing\u201d is replacing the \u201cnot\u201d that would have negated the verb. But to English speakers, it\u2019s just the more comfortable way to express that the action X has not been (will not be, should not be, etc.) applied to any objects. Certainly we can and do say \u201cnot X anything,\u201d but \u201cX nothing\u201d is, I think, more common.

This pretty much defeats the purpose of the logistics network system and I wonder if I can somehow automatize that.\n\nMy first idea was to place a requester chest and a passive provider chest next to each other with an inserter taking from the requester chest to the provider chest. The plan was that the requester requests the combat supplies from my combat supply production center which then get transferred to the provider chest which then transfers them to me when required.

None of them have worked perfectly yet or became so complex they can't easily be explained so therefore I have not updated this answer yet. With a future (as of this writing) 0\\.16\\.x release it seems this problem will go away completely.\n\nThe new buffer chests (green) will be a hybrid between requester chests (blue) and passive provider chests (red). I presume the robots will attempt to fill these new chests before putting anything into generic storage chests (yellow), and also grab from them before going to storage or passive providers, given the images and descriptions in that blog post:\n\n> By using a buffer chest, you can setup a dedicated 'supply area', where the buffer chest will already contain all the typical items, and the bots can quickly top\\-up your inventory.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Using the buffer chest, it will be easy to setup nearby supplies to\n>  quickly repair the walls when needed.\n> \n> \n> *\\- Factorio devs*\n\n---\n\nCircuit network approach\n========================\n\nThe idea is to prevent an infinite loop by not requesting anything when it's not needed, and not allowing anything to be picked up from your remote depot until it has been filled completely, at which point it makes everything available to the player (or any other requester chests nearby).\n\n1. Put a requester chest somewhere near where you want things delivered,\ndo not make it request anything yet. Make sure it's set to **\"set requests\"**.\n2. Put a regular non\\-logistics chest next to it, leaving one space between them. This will be our \"buffer\" to prevent loops.\n3. Put an inserter between the chests, rotated so it picks from the requester chest and places into the regular chest.\n4. Put a storage chest 1 tile away from the regular chest.\n5. Put an inserter between those chests so it takes from the regular chest and puts it into the storage chest.\n6. Put a decider combinator somewhere nearby, set it to trigger if combat supply X goes below Y amount. Set the output type to \"1 of X\".\n7. Grab a wire (say red) and connect the regular and storage chests together with the inserter which **takes** from the regular chest, and connect them with the **input** side of the combinator. The combinator should now show the current total amount of supply X in the depot as its input value, and the output value should be 1 of that type.\n8. Set the condition on that inserter to only trigger if supply X is equal to the amount Y.\n9. Connect the **output** of the combinator to the requester chest.\n\nThe depot should now slowly begin to fill the regular \"buffer\" chest via the requester chest and the first inserter between them. Once the target amount Y has been reached the requests will stop and the other inserter will take over and dump everything into storage. Requests will resume once the total number of X\\-items in the chests goes below the Y threshold.\n\nSince bots prioritize fetching from storage chests, they will likely grab from there over a passive provider chest further away when you pass by.\n\nIf there's stuff left in the storage chest after you're tanked up, they will be moved back to the requester chest by the bots and end up in the buffer chest again, until the're eventually dumped back into the storage chest when the system has reached the threshold.\n\nThere are ways to tweak this system for various purposes and uses.\n\nIf you want to fill the depot faster; put an arithmetic combinator between the first combinator and the requester chest, and set it to multiply the input amount (1\\) by some factor (say 10\\) (make sure to output the same type). The chest will keep requesting 10 items until the system is full (prepare for some overflow as bots always grab/deliver a full cargo hold if they can).\n\nYou could use more combinators to always request the exact number of items left until the system is full, but simply multiplying the number of items requested uses fewer components.\n\nIf bots often end up re\\-filling the system from itself by emptying lots of items from the storage chest into the requester, add another decider combinator (using the green network) which triggers if the storage chest contains Z items, where Z is much lower than the total amount above (Y) and set it so the inserter only grabs that amount from the buffer.\nIt may take slightly longer to restock the player as the storage chest is emptied out more often, but the bots will more likely restock the depot more efficiently as there's not as much \"available\" from the depot itself.\n\nYou could also let the filling of the storage chest be player\\-controlled by hooking up a state\\-reading gate pole (or even multiple ones at different locations) to the iserter and only allowing it to operate while you're standing near the gate(s). But if you have to run to a specific location you may as well grab directly from the buffer chest, perhaps conveniently placed near your gates."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Factorio base, you want to create multiple supply depots around your perimeter that automatically restock combat supplies.

Some languages may have a single word to express the two actions together, but that is not the case in English.\n\nNote that two of the examples given by Cambridge are:\n\n> Camille snorts when she laughs.\n\nAs well as:\n\n> By this time I was snorting with laughter.\n\nIn general, I would say that people are more likely to exhale when snorting with laughter than to inhale, so this fits the first half of your action reasonably well.\n\nSimilarly, [this site](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/snort) seems to take it as given that it involves exhaling (though it need not, it at least indicates a tendency):\n\n> make a snorting sound by exhaling hard.\n\nHowever, note that \"snorting\" would rarely refer to exhaling with the mouth alone to express laughter.\n\nIf you want to refer to the exhalation and the smiling together, you would likely have to use two verbs: \"He snorted with amusement and smiled.\" It is perhaps also worth keeping in mind here that the actions used to express amusement are not entirely universal across cultures, so if (for instance) this is a situation where the character is exhaling rapidly through their *mouth* and then smiling, this would not be common in some English\\-speaking countries, which might be why English would lack a single word for it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In English, which word best describes the action of exhaling quickly through the nose as a reaction to something amusing, often accompanied by a smile?\n\nA) Chuckle\nB) Snort\nC) Guffaw\nD) Sigh\n\nCorrect Answer: B) Snort\n\nExplanation: \nThe word \"snort\" most accurately describes the action of exhaling quickly through the nose in response to something amusing. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, to snort means \"to make an explosive sound by forcing air quickly up or down the nose.\" This definition aligns closely with the scenario described in the question.\n\nWhile \"snort\" doesn't inherently include the action of smiling, it's often associated with amusement and can be followed by a smile. The other options are less accurate:\n\nA) Chuckle: This refers to a soft, low laugh, but doesn't specifically involve exhaling through the nose.\nC) Guffaw: This describes a loud, boisterous laugh, which is more intense than the action described in the question.\nD) Sigh: While this involves exhaling, it typically expresses weariness, sadness, or relief rather than amusement.\n\nIt's important to note that \"snort\" primarily describes the exhaling action and doesn't include the smiling component.

Semiconductors are used to make transistors and diodes. A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor, such as metallic copper, and an insulator, such as glass. In my textbook, they say that its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"dopants\") into the crystal structure. When two differently doped regions exist in the same crystal, a semiconductor junction is created.\n\nNow, the different materials created from \"doping\" are called \"p\" and \"n\" materials. But, why semiconductors? Can't we dope insulators and conductors to make a diode instead of a semiconductor? If not, Why? (I know this question is vague, but I just wanted to know if there is a **very special reason** we like semiconductors so much. It is fine if it involves complected math and physics)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The properties of semi\\-conductors arise from the structure of the energy levels that electrons can occupy in the material.\n\nPut simply, electron energy levels can be divided into lower energy valence band levels, where electrons are attached to a particular atom, and higher energy conduction band levels, where electrons can move throughout the material. Electrons in conduction band levels can carry charge throughout the material and so allow a current to flow if an electric field is applied to the material.\n\nIn a conductor the valence band levels merge into the conduction band levels, and there are always many electrons in the conduction band acting as charge carriers. In an insulator there is a big gap (the band gap) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, and there are very few electrons in the conduction band. Nothing is a perfect insulator, but it takes a very strong electric field to free electrons from atoms in an insulator.\n\nIn a semi\\-conductor, there is a smaller gap between top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The Fermi level, which is the maximum energy level of electrons averaged over time, lies in this band gap. However, at any time there are always a few electrons with energies above the Fermi level, so these can enter the conduction band and act as charge carriers. Doping the semi\\-conductor moves the Fermi level up or down in the band gap.\n\nDoping a conductor might increase its conductivity slightly, but the conductivity of conductors like metals is so high anyway that this would make little difference. Doping an insulator does not generally reduce the size of its wide band gap, so there are still few electrons in the conduction band, and a doped insulator is usually still an insulator (although there are some exceptions).\n\nThere is a more detailed explanation of how semi\\-conductors work in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why semiconductors are preferred over insulators or conductors for creating diodes and transistors?\n\nA) Semiconductors have a higher electrical conductivity than both insulators and conductors, making them ideal for electronic components.\n\nB) The band gap in semiconductors can be easily eliminated through doping, unlike in insulators or conductors.\n\nC) Semiconductors have a moderate band gap that allows for controlled manipulation of charge carriers through doping, whereas insulators and conductors lack this flexibility.\n\nD) Doping semiconductors creates a permanent change in their crystal structure, which is not possible with insulators or conductors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Semiconductors are preferred for creating diodes and transistors because they have a moderate band gap between the valence and conduction bands. This band gap is smaller than that of insulators but larger than that of conductors. \n\nThis unique property allows semiconductors to be effectively manipulated through doping, which can alter the Fermi level and control the number of charge carriers. Insulators have too large a band gap for doping to be effective in creating charge carriers, while conductors already have abundant charge carriers and their conductivity is not significantly affected by doping.\n\nOption A is incorrect because semiconductors do not have higher conductivity than conductors. \nOption B is false because doping does not eliminate the band gap in semiconductors, it only alters the Fermi level within the existing band gap. \nOption D is incorrect because doping does not create a permanent change in the crystal structure; it introduces impurities that affect the electronic properties."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/05", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59686", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/148775/"], "docs_id": 59686, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does the word \"mortarboard\" mean \u2014 not how do you get it \u2014 how did they decide that word makes sense in this context?\n\nAlso, I think i just hit the reputation cap for the first time (for what is now yesterday).

The output of vmstat would show this better during the problem scenario.\n\n```\nvmstat 1 30\n\n```\n\nHowever, neither top or vmstat are well suited for diagnosing issues after the fact. \n\nMy general advice would be to install the `sysstat` package. This will enable system metrics to be saved periodically and the information can then be retrieved later by `sar`. Sysstat may be configured for substantial detail, but the default configuration will give you an initial overview over CPU usage, system load, paging and swapping. \n\n```\nyum install sysstat\n\nsar \nsar -q\nsar -B\nsar -W\n\n```\n\nIf this reveals little of use, you may need to look deeper, however. Something may be going on that is not immediately visible through the common performance metrics, other than the process queue (load average). One possibility is that the CPU is preoccupied with excessive interrupt requests, causing processes to queue up for what little processing time remains available to the system. \n\nIf that is the case, you may be able to find some clues in /proc/interrupts\n\n```\ncat /proc/interrupts\n\n```\n\nPerhaps network adapters or the local timer show an unusually high number of interrupts?\n\nIt may come down to familiarizing yourself with `perf` and waiting for the next occurrence of the problem. Start recording once the trouble starts, or automate the process with a script that triggers on high load average.\n\n```\nperf record -a\n\nperf report\n\n```\n\nPerf provides an incredibly detailed view of operations on the system, but also collects a lot of data and causes significant overhead, making it impractical to have it running continuously. \n\nIn the case of CentOS 6\\.3 there is a chance that mysterious high load averages will go away with an upgrade to CentOS 6\\.4, which resolves a bug in the kernel source that relates to the local timer. However, your problem could just as well be caused by any given driver that may have been provided by your hardware vendor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is investigating a CentOS 6.3 server that experienced an extremely high load average (75) without apparent high CPU usage.

Soak repeatedly and tap the pipes frequently to help the oil penetrate into the threads. Always use two pipe wrenches, one to \"back up\" the fitting to reduce stresses on the rest of the assembly.

I recently won my first prince level game as the Egyptians, beating England with a time victory. From the onset, bankruptcy was my greatest threat. I maintained a small enough army not to suck my treasury dry. I built markets, banks, stock markets, several customs houses and spent most of the game with cities focused on gold and producing gold. Only the necessary roads were built while the commerce policy tree offered little. I won but had my cities been focused on production, my economy would have collapsed. Once I invaded England and created puppet states, I built trading posts rather than farms without success. In the earlier versions of Civ, advanced civilizations cranked out the gold even with huge millitaries and all city improvements built. Civ V seems geared to bankrupt you.\n\nAm I missing something big? How do I avoid going bankrupt?\n\n---\n\nI appreciate everyone's help. If cities aren't designed to build every improvement, that will take some getting used to. I've started a new game and will try to specialize each city accordingly. But one difference from previous Civs is the amount of gold received from trading resources. My opponents have never offered a large GPT for anything. This combined with diluted wonders is frustrating. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Expenses\n--------\n\nThe top two things that cost you money in Civ 5 are:\n\n* Buildings\n* Military\n\nTo reduce the first one, be strategic about what you build where. Cities should be focused on a task. Pick terrain, tile improvements, and buildings that compliment this focus. For instance, if you are building a production\\-focused city, build it near hills and forests, and focus on military and production enhancing buildings. Don't build science or cashflow generating buildings, since you won't be producing much of those in this city.\n\nLikewise, if you are building a science focused city, don't build military or other production enhancing buildings there. The city's focus should be on science or economic enhancing buildings instead. \n\nThe only exception is happiness \\- in order to maintain a positive balance on the happiness scale, you'll likely have to build some happiness generation buildings in most or all of your cities. This tends to be one of the largest trade offs economically in most of my games \\- do I make the people happier, or do I bank some extra gold?\n\nYou can also guide each city's governor to focus on a particular area, and this can help your citizens understand what they need to do in order to support your vision for the city. If you leave the governor alone, the city may ignore some of your tile improvements in order to work tiles that create something you're not interested in, but which makes the city's output more balanced.\n\nAlso, don't let your workers run free \\- focus your tile improvements on whatever works best for the city the tile is in the radius of. \u00a0Automated workers don't always pick the best terrain improvement for you. \u00a0They may destroy forest or plant farms around a city that is going to be production focused, for instance. \n\nEvery unit you produce costs you money every turn as well. Try to focus your attention towards a small, but mobile army, and don't fight on multiple fronts if you can avoid it. Mixed unit tactics involving ranged artillery units and close\\-up front line fighters work best. The AI is terrible at war, and they will generally start on the offensive, even though you've likely got your army massed and ready to funnel them into a meat grinder.\n\nIf you find yourself with a strong surplus of units, gift some to an allied city\\-state. You'll gain influence with them, and if you declare war, those units are likely to still benefit you indirectly.\n\nIncome\n------\n\nYou gain money via citizens assigned to money\\-generating tiles, trade agreements with other Civs, and by trade routes between cities. Any duplicate of a luxury resource does you no good \\- it is there to trade. \n\nIf you end up with 2 of a luxury, or more of a strategic resource than you need, find someone rich and sell it to them for a tidy profit. Suppling your possible enemies with strategic resources might sound like a bad idea, but since you control the flow of that resource, if they start doing something you don't like, you can cut them off and drastically reduce the effectiveness of any resource\\-requiring units they produced in the meantime.\n\nThere's also a glitch that I don't believe has been patched whereby if you destroy a luxury good improvement (thereby reducing the amount of that luxury good available) you can end a trade agreement early at no penalty, and then rebuild the improvement and sell the good back to that same Civ for another sum of money. This could be considered cheating, and I imagine someday it (will be/has been) patched however.\n\nRoads between cities are generally profitable, but you want to try to minimize the number of redundant road links you have, as having 2 roads between 2 cities counts the same as having one, and costs you extra."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Civilization V documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Civilization V, which of the following strategies would be LEAST effective for maintaining a strong economy?\n\nA) Specializing cities for specific tasks and building improvements accordingly\nB) Maintaining a large standing army in every city for defense\nC) Trading excess luxury and strategic resources with other civilizations\nD) Carefully planning road networks to minimize redundancy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because specializing cities and building focused improvements is recommended as an effective strategy for economic management.\n\nB) is the correct answer because maintaining a large standing army in every city would be very costly and drain the economy.

Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate and secure method to achieve this?\n\nA) Set up a Type A record pointing to the router's public IP and configure port forwarding on the router to direct traffic to the VM\nB) Configure the VM to use a public IP address directly, bypassing the router\nC) Use a Dynamic DNS service to update the domain's IP address whenever the router's public IP changes\nD) Set up a VPN server on the router and configure the domain to point to the VPN's IP address\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option A, while functional, is not ideal as it can interfere with router management and may pose security risks. Option B is typically not possible in a home network setup and would expose the VM directly to the internet. Option D is overly complex for this scenario and doesn't directly solve the problem. \n\nOption C, using a Dynamic DNS service, is the most appropriate solution. It allows the domain to always point to the correct IP address, even if the router's public IP changes. This approach maintains the security benefits of the router while providing a reliable way to access the VM from the internet. Additionally, many routers and DNS providers offer built-in support for Dynamic DNS, making it a practical and widely-supported solution."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/234618", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/56903/"], "docs_id": 234618, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are lots of posts to do with QGIS crashing; they tend to deal with specific instances and conditions. \n\nBut this has led me to want to know what is a crash minidump? \n\nWhat is happening, is there a simple answer?\n\nThe background leading up to this is that I have a user that has a crash minidump every time that they close QGIS (2\\.14\\.9\\), even though many others are using the same version, on exactly the same machines, of the same age and make without issue.\n\nThen myself, using QGIS 2\\.16 , I was testing out an answer from [Merging attribute and geometric features in QGIS?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/233489/merging-attribute-and-geometric-features-in-qgis/233491#comment363558_233491) it gave me a crash minidump each time I tried dissolve vectors.

This is typically indicative of a firewall issue. The documentation reveals that the problem was resolved by disabling ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) on the LAN client. Firewalls can often allow ICMP traffic (used by ping) while blocking or interfering with SSH connections.

Option C, while viable, is ruled out due to budget constraints mentioned in the question. Option D, using a simple comparator, might not be sensitive enough to reliably detect the small voltage change (0.5 mV) between inactive and active states.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate solution given the constraints. A sigma-delta ADC offers high resolution to detect the small voltage change.

The Nyquist frequency, which is twice the highest frequency content of the signal, is the minimum sampling rate required to accurately reconstruct the original analog signal. Using Fourier analysis to determine the signal's frequency content and then configuring the microcontroller's timer to sample at the appropriate rate is the correct approach.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses a fixed sampling rate without considering the actual frequency content of the signal, which may lead to oversampling or undersampling.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while Python might be useful for prototyping, the MSP430 requires C programming for direct hardware control and efficient execution.\n\nOption D is incorrect because sampling at the lowest possible frequency could lead to aliasing and loss of high-frequency information in the audio signal.

I would pick an ORM and live with it because switching it out would be too much work and would cost time and money with very little benefit. \n\nIn this case, I would use the ORM that meets your requirements, which in this case according to what has been stated is nHibernate. If you have already invested time and effort into Entity Framework and it is too late to reverse course, then I would write a custom implementation to handle the large data set case and continue on using Entity Framework to handle the other majority of data access scenarios."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is considering changing their ORM from Entity Framework to nHibernate in their MVC application using the Repository Pattern.

For specific cases where nHibernate might be needed (such as handling large data sets), a custom implementation can be created to address those particular requirements.

However, many contemporary access points will function properly as a bridge or repeater on a network that is secured properly with WPA2\\. You may also be able to squeeze additional functionality into existing hardware by upgrading the manufacturer's firmware to DD\\-WRT.

Let me denote by $G\\=GL\\_n(\\\\mathbb{F})$ for simplicity; I was working throughout the previous years many times with the quotient $G/Z(G)$ (i.e. the group of inner automoprhisms of $G$) which is known as the \"projective linear group\" and it is denoted explicitly as $PGL\\_n(\\\\mathbb{F})$. Now my question as it mentioned in the title is why the name of that group contains the word \"projective\". Apparently there is a correlation with projective geometry, whilst whether $n\\=2$ we have the so\\-called M\u00f6bius Transformation group. At the Wiki article the situation (at least in my eyes) isn't that clear. So can you please help me out with this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general linear group $GL\\_n(k)$ is the group of automorphisms (in a suitable sense) of the $n$\\-space $k^n$. Similarly, the projective linear group $PGL\\_n(k)$ is the group of automorphisms (in a suitable sense\\*) of the projective $n$\\-space $\\\\mathbb{P}^n(k)$.\n\nIn projective geometry, two nonzero points are identified if they are on a same line going through the origin. (The relation with [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry) is well explained at Wikipedia.) So it's natural to think that a transformation that takes any line to itself (i.e. all vectors are eigenvectors) acts \"trivially\" on the projective space. This explains why we must at least quotient out by the scalar multiple of the identity.\n\nIt's then an exercise to show that if a linear map is such that all vectors are eigenvectors, then the linear map is a scalar multiple of the identity. So we don't need to quotient out by anything else.\n\n---\n\n\\* The group $PGL\\_n(k)$ is the set of invertible elements of the monoid of functions $\\\\mathbb{P}^n(k) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ which come from linear maps $k^{n\\+1} \\\\to k^{n\\+1}$ under the identification $\\\\mathbb{P}^n(k) \\= (k^{n\\+1} \\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}) / \\\\sim$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: The projective linear group PGL_n(F) is defined as the quotient G/Z(G), where G = GL_n(F) and Z(G) is its center.

This ties directly to projective geometry, where points are identified if they lie on the same line through the origin. The group PGL_n(F) preserves this structure, acting as transformations on the projective space.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect as there is no mathematician named John Projective.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that PGL_n(F) represents inner automorphisms, but it's not about projections onto subspaces.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while PGL_n(F) is indeed a quotient group of GL_n(F), the term \"projective\" doesn't refer to this quotient operation but rather to its action on projective space."}}
