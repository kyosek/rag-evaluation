I really wanted to answer their question, so I told them I'd answer tomorrow. Please let me know! Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first and second uses of the verb *do* are different.\n\nThe first *do* (\"what **does**\") is an auxiliary verb, which doesn't have meaning on its own, except to properly phrase a question. The auxiliary *do* is conjugated in the typical way:\n\nWhat do I...  \n\nWhat do you...  \n\nWhat does he...  \n\nWhat did I...  \n\nThe verb that follows the auxiliary *do* should be in the form of a *bare infinitive*, that is, the infinitive minus the *to*.

That term has multiple definitions, but here, we can think of a verb phrase just as multiple words which are used in combination as a verb. Some similar verb phrases with an auxiliary verb and a main verb are *he **can** do* and *he **should** do*.\n\nWhen we use a verb phrase, only one component of the phrase is conjugated to match the subject: \n\n*I **can** go*  \n\n*You **can** go*  \n\n*He **can** go*\\*\n\nIn this case, you can think of the verb phrase as *he does do* (an emphatic form of the statement *he does*), which is then inverted to form the interrogative form: *he does do* \\-\\> *what does he do?* \n\nOther examples will follow the same pattern:\n\nWhat does \\[auxiliary] she like \\[bare infinitive]?  \n\nWhere did \\[auxiliary in the past tense] they go \\[bare infinitive]?  \n\nHe does \\[auxiliary, here used for emphasis, not to form a question] think \\[bare infinitive]!\n\n---\n\n\\* This isn't the best example because *can* is irregular and is conjugated identically.

You take the slice between, say $z\\=2\\.3$nm and $z\\=2\\.301$nm, and count the average number of atoms in it.

The answer you get is the number density at $z\\=2\\.3$nm\n\nIn practice: Each simulation snapshot, you write down the z\\-coordinate of each atom. As the simulation goes on, you get a larger and larger list of real numbers\\-\\-\\-all those z\\-coordinates. Now, plot those numbers in the form of a histogram. If you have a long enough simulation, you can make the bin size of your histogram very very small, so the histogram will look like a smooth curve.

I have been able to determine which copies of these submanifolds should have the stated properties and convince myself how the non\\-orientability of the ambient space $K^2\\\\times S^1$ allows for the submanifolds in question to twist back on themselves in unusual ways, but nevertheless I still cannot form a decent picture of what this really means.\n\nThe real issue with my understanding what is going on with these submanifolds seems to be that although these phenomenon occur in a non\\-orientable space, this space can itself be embedded in an orientable space and so it seems that these odd tori and Klein bottles should therefore embed in an orientable space as well and so I should have some chance of visualizing these phenomena when I project down to $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$\n\n> **Question:** Does anyone have a good picture or other approach to help visualize what a one\\-sided torus or two\\-sided Klein bottle looks like?\n\nSo while it may be too much to hope for a projection that accurately reflects the sidedness of these creatures, I am hoping someone may have a decent projection of either of these creatures to the plane or 3\\-space that shows some manifestations of their odd behaviour in their ambient space.

This is due to the architectural constraints of 32-bit systems, which typically can only address up to about 3.3GB of RAM, even when 4GB is physically installed.

It is a many\\-sorted first\\-order theory. The sorts include numbers (natural, real, complex), sets, ordered pairs and other tuples, functions, manifolds, projective spaces, Hilbert spaces, and whatnot. There are axioms asserting the basic properties of these and the relations between them. For example, there are axioms saying that the real numbers form a complete ordered field, that any formula determines the set of those reals that satisfy it (and similarly with other sorts in place of the reals), that two tuples are equal iff they have the same length and equal components in all positions, etc.\n> \n> \n> There are no axioms that attempt to reduce one sort to another. In particular, nothing says, for example, that natural numbers or real numbers are sets of any kind. (Different mathematicians may disagree as to whether, say, the real numbers are a subset of the complex ones or whether they are a separate sort with a canonical embedding into the complex numbers. Such issues will not affect the general idea that I'm trying to explain.)

The discussion emphasizes that mathematicians, including set theorists, do not actually work directly within formal systems like T or ZFC. Instead, they use carefully articulated natural language in their reasoning. Formal systems like T and ZFC are developed as approximations or models of how mathematicians actually think and work. The answer highlights that these formal systems are tools for understanding mathematical reasoning, rather than the exact method mathematicians use in practice.

The speed of light passing near the Sun (as seen from Earth) will be less then c. Why is that?\n\nIt is because the speed of light is calculated by the distance it travels, divided by the time passes.\n\nNow here on Earth, our clocks run faster compared to the clocks at the Sun. That is because the Sun's stress\\-energy is bigger, and its gravitational effects are stronger and it slows down time near the Sun (compared to the clock on Earth).\n\nNow when we are trying to calculate the path, the Sun's stress\\-energy curves spacetime and light travels in a spacetime that is not flat as it passes the Sun.\n\nNow if we calculate the speed of light as it passes the Sun, our clocks here on Earth show more time to pass, so we will divide by a bigger amount of time.\n\nIf you divide the path that the light travels, with a time that is bigger, you will get a speed less then c.\n\nAnalogously, if you would measure the speed of light as it passes near the Earth, when viewed from the Sun, it would be more then c. It is because clocks at the Sun would run slower (compared to clock near the Earth), and so less time would pass on the clocks at the Sun, where the observer is. You would divide the path with a time that is less (compared to the time that passes near the Earth), and so you would get a speed more then c.\n\nThis is one of the basic experimental tests of GR.\n\nSo the speed of EM waves is c everywhere in vacuum in the universe, when measured locally.\n\nBut when measured non\\-locally, it might vary. \n\nNow this speed is the speed of Gravitational waves too."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An astronomer on Earth observes light passing near a massive neutron star on its way to Earth.

This scenario describes the Shapiro effect, a consequence of General Relativity. When light passes near a massive object like a neutron star, spacetime is curved, affecting the path of light. Additionally, time runs slower near massive objects due to gravitational time dilation. \n\nAn Earth-based observer's clock runs faster compared to the time near the neutron star. When calculating the speed of light (distance divided by time), the observer on Earth measures more time passing than would be measured locally near the neutron star. This results in a calculation that yields a speed less than c.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the speed of light is c when measured locally in vacuum, it can appear different when measured from a distance due to gravitational effects.\n\nOption B is incorrect because gravitational lensing bends light but doesn't make it appear faster than c from Earth's perspective.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the effect doesn't alternate based on the neutron star's rotation in this manner.\n\nThis question tests understanding of General Relativity concepts, particularly the Shapiro effect and how the perceived speed of light can vary when measured non-locally in the presence of strong gravitational fields."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/07", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/199526", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4054/"], "docs_id": 199526, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to build a variable gain amplifier.

The next version of the Android app will include a small reputation tracker widget, more info about that below, but before we get started on the more difficult widgets I wanted to get some extra feedback.\n\nWe've tossed around the ideas of three different widgets:\n\n1. Single\\-site reputation tracking.\n2. Inbox and Achievements, similar to the GMail inbox widget.\n3. A small \"Hot Network Questions\" widget replicating the right side of this page right now, with one question at a time.\n\nThe first one of these is done. When you place a widget on your device it has you select a Stack Exchange community to track, then looks like this: \n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/n38Ss.png)\n\nCurrently this widget updates every 30 minutes, we're also considering making it real\\-time but it's a bit difficult to do that without destroying your battery. Would real\\-time updating make it more useful?\n\nRegarding the other widgets: Would you actually use them? It seems like the questions regarding widgets have very low vote counts so it doesn't a lot of sense to dedicate time to them if people aren't excited about them. Preferably we'd only add one other widget in the near future, but we might add both other ones if people are interested in them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Widgets are fancy and all, but these ones seem kind of... pointless, to be frank. I don't really care about knowing my precise rep score each and every moment of my day. Furthermore, the number is essentially meaningless. Unless I'm expected to memorize my rep every 30 minutes, I have no idea what happened to make it go up or down.\n\nWhat would be a better idea is having a widget that shows things that actually *matter*, and that shows things that give you meaningful information at a glance.

A magnet generates field lines that look like the following:\n\n[![picture of a magnet](https://i.stack.imgur.com/46Gdk.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/46Gdk.png)\n\nThe field lines from the magnet extend throughout all space, which is how we are able to detect them on the surface of the earth. What your compass needle is doing is aligning itself with the arrows in the diagram above, which tells you in what direction the field points at that location, which also implies in what direction the south pole of the magnet is.\n\nMagnetic fields are also generated by current carrying wires. To understand why moving charges (currents) create a magnetic field, see this answer: [How do moving charges produce magnetic fields?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65335/how-do-moving-charges-produce-magnetic-fields).

Near a straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire, perpendicular to its length. Therefore, the compass needle will align itself tangent to these circular field lines, which means it will be perpendicular to the wire. This alignment occurs because the magnetic field generated by the current can be stronger than Earth's magnetic field at close distances, overriding the Earth's influence on the compass. The needle doesn't require distinct north and south poles to align itself; it simply follows the direction of the strongest local magnetic field."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/01/06", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2012332", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/217065/"], "docs_id": 2012332, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have done my application in portrait configuration.

Creating separate layout files for portrait and landscape orientations is the most effective approach for ensuring proper layout in both configurations. By placing portrait layouts in the \"res/layout\" directory and landscape layouts in the \"res/layout-land\" directory, Android will automatically choose the appropriate layout based on the device's orientation. This method allows for fine-tuned control over the UI in both orientations without the need for complex programmatic adjustments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's possible to adjust controls programmatically, it's more complex and error-prone than using separate layout files.\n\nOption C is incorrect because forcing the application to remain in portrait mode limits usability and goes against Android design principles of supporting multiple orientations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while FrameLayout is useful in some scenarios, it doesn't automatically adjust for different orientations and isn't suitable for complex layouts that need to change significantly between portrait and landscape modes."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/10", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/172129", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/22856/"], "docs_id": 172129, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Nvidia Gtx 770 MSI twin Frozr 2gb version and I have used Auto Detect in Watch Dogs but for some reason I get MASSIVE Fps drops when moving around the world.

Prior to the installation, there was a section of hardwood and a section of carpet. I took out the hardwood so that I would be able to have a level surface for all of the LVP to be installed on.\n\nThe hardware was glued down to sheets of particleboard and pulling up the hardwood did a lot of damage to the particleboard. I did what I could to fill in the bumps, but after installing it, there are sections where it just feels uneven to walk on, with slight divots in different places. If I could go back, I would have cut out the particleboard under the hardwood and replace it with new particleboard.\n\nI\u2019m concerned that these divots might cause damage to the LVP over time, and of course I would like it to feel a bit better to walk on. Has anyone been in a similar situation to me? Did you leave it as is and was it fine over time? (I feel like I might be extra sensitive about walking on it, because it was just installed). Would it be worth dismantling the LVP and putting new particleboard underneath the uneven section?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the divots and unevenness occur in frequently walked areas, you risk damaging the tight connection and seal between the planks. The planks will start to separate with unsightly kitchen grime collecting in the tiny gaps. Further, spills might seep into these cracks, causing permanent water damage or becoming the source of foul odour.\n\nYou might also experience cracking of the planks. Replacing a plank is laborious if not impossible, and hopefully you have extras set aside.\n\nIn less walked portions of the kitchen small unevenness would not be a problem, even if noticeable.\n\nSo assess the location of the imperfection, and lean towards re\\-laying if in doubt.\n\nYou don't have to replace the subfloor, and instead lay 1/4in or 3/8in plywood over it.

They are using PCA to ensure that the numeric input data is linearly independent. The intended response variable is not being included in the PCA. I think this is a mistake, because it fails to take into consideration how much a dimension of low variance in the explanatory data can impact the response. \n\nIntuitively, if I have two explanatory variables, they fall on a plane. If I run a PCA on those two variables alone (excluding the response variable), and PC1 explains 95% of the variance, I *might* conclude I can safely ignore PC2\\. This implies that the response and the explanatory variables together form what is mostly a 2\\-D space, and linearity implies that the responses lie approximately along a line through that 2\\-D plane. \n\nYet we haven't taken the responses into account yet. If in fact the responses vary sharply in the PC2 dimension, then linearity implies they lie roughly not along a 1\\-D line, but rather lie close to a sharply tilted plane. We will be ignoring that sharp tilt, effectively making predictions that assume the plane of responses is flat with respect to PC2\\.\n\nMy contention is, if we throw out PC2 because PC1 explains 95% of the variance in the explanatory variables alone, then we have a potentially far inferior model to one that leaves PC2 in. My gut tells me that this is a problem, and that it goes away when the response variable is included in the PCA.

It maximizes the variance in the original variable set accounted for by a relatively small number of components, which are weighted linear composites of the original variables. It does not maximize for predictive utility, but purely for data reduction. Therefore there is no particular reason to expect the component to be well related to the outcome. Whereas there *are* substantial red flags to incorporating the outcome into the modeling of its predictor.\n\nIf you want to maximize for predictive utility of the components, I suggest looking into Partial Least Squares (PLS) modeling (sometimes called PLS\\-SEM).

The problem is very simple, a ball with radius R is attached to a rope of length L. The pendulum is subject to gravity and oscillates in a plane. I used angular momentum to solve the problem.

Is $\\\\omega$ always the total angular velocity? Do I have to calculate the inertia tensor I with respect to a point on the axis of rotation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the ball is suspended from its centre of mass (CoM) then it does not rotate as it swings (diagram 1\\). The forces on it act through the CoM and there is no torque. The ball maintains the same orientation in space. This can be described as a **simple pendulum**.\n\nIn your case if the ball is rotating as it swings then as you deduce its angular momentum must be changing. This could happen if the string or rod is attached at the rim of the ball (diagram 2\\). Now it is possible for the ball to rotate around the point of attachment. As this happens the tension in the string or rod does not pass through the CoM of the ball. So there can be a varying torque on the ball which causes a rotation in space. This is a **compound pendulum**.\n\nAnother arrangement is to have the stiff rod attached at two points on the ball, instead of only one (diagram 3\\). Now the forces on the ball from the rod need not act through the same point, so a torque can be created which rotates the ball in space while it swings.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CNOm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CNOm.png)\n\nIn another arrangement a heavy ball could rest on the seat of a swing.

(note that \\_ and \\_\\_ are not reserved for the same things, see comments)\n\nEven if the names are under scope (namespace, class, etc.), there can be some global names, in particular macros, which use these prefix and might silently break your code if you use them too.\n\nSo, basically, most of the time it is safe to use these prefix BUT if you don't use them you have a 100% guarantee that your naming will never conflict with the implementation names.\n\nWhich is why, in doubt, don't use these prefix."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary reason why using variables with leading underscores (e.g., _variable or __variable) is considered bad practice in C and C++?\n\nA) Modern compilers get confused by variables starting with underscores and may produce unexpected results.\nB) Variables with leading underscores are reserved for compiler-generated temporary variables and may cause naming conflicts.\nC) The C and C++ standards reserve identifiers with leading underscores for implementation details, potentially causing conflicts with standard library implementations.\nD) Using leading underscores in variable names makes the code less readable and harder to maintain.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The primary reason for avoiding variables with leading underscores is that the C and C++ standards reserve these identifiers for implementation details, such as those used in standard library implementations. This reservation is to prevent conflicts between user-defined names and names used by the language implementation or standard libraries.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because modern compilers generally handle underscores in variable names without confusion. The issue is not about compiler limitations but about adhering to language standards.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in mentioning potential naming conflicts, but it incorrectly states that these are reserved for compiler-generated temporary variables. The reservation is broader, covering implementation details in general.\n\nAnswer D, while it might be a matter of style preference for some developers, is not the primary reason why leading underscores are discouraged.

A good chunk of my friends are married and have kids, so that limits the availability of them getting out to do things with me.\n\n\\-Music is probably my biggest passion and I love going to concerts! My usual is mostly Rock/Alternative, but it can vary depending on the day and what mood I'm in. I enjoy going out to eat/drinks with friends, trying new places, photography, travelling, and going to games **to name a few**. I enjoy going out on the town for drinks or dancing, but not one that will be at the clubs every weekend. I prefer places where you can actually hear the people you're with. I am also good with just having **a low key evening at home** , and at times rather would do that. I like watching most major sports, baseball in particular.

Here's why:\n\n1. The measurements are taken on the same 73 samples using two different methods. This creates paired data, where each sample has a measurement from Method A and Method B.\n\n2. Although the measurements might be taken at different locations on each sample, they are still from the same physical object, making them dependent observations.\n\n3. The question states that the sampling process is non-destructive and samples do not change over time, further supporting the use of a paired analysis.\n\n4.

With this, you can run all *three* floors off of the same boiler even \\-\\- large buildings routinely are heated using independently zoned hydronic air handlers in each room all run off a single large boiler plant.\n\n(As a sidenote, there are multi\\-circulator zoning techniques, but a circulator is bigger, heavier, more power\\-hungry, and more likely to break than a zone valve :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a large house with uneven heating on the first floor, what is the most efficient way to create separate heating zones while using a single boiler?\n\nA) Install multiple thermostats directly connected to the boiler\nB) Use zone valves controlled by separate thermostats\nC) Install separate boilers for each floor\nD) Use multi-circulator zoning techniques\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe most efficient solution for creating separate heating zones while using a single boiler is to use zone valves controlled by separate thermostats. This allows for:\n\n1. Independent temperature control in different areas of the house\n2. Use of a single boiler for multiple zones, even across different floors\n3. Energy efficiency by heating only the areas that need it\n4. Less equipment compared to multi-circulator systems, as zone valves are smaller, lighter, and less likely to break than circulators\n5. The ability to run the boiler and circulator on demand, only when a zone is calling for heat\n\nOption A is incorrect because multiple thermostats directly connected to the boiler would not allow for zoned control. Option C is unnecessarily complex and expensive. Option D, while possible, is less efficient and more prone to issues than using zone valves."}}
