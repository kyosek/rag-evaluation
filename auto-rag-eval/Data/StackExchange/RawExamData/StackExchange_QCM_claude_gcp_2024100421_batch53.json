Let's break down why:\n\nA) Incorrect: The touch -r option is used to reference another file's timestamp, not to set a specific date. The syntax is also incorrect for recursively targeting all files.\n\nB) Incorrect: While this command would work, it uses the -d option which is less precise than -t, and the date format is different. It also uses \\; instead of +, which is less efficient for large numbers of files.\n\nC) Correct: This command correctly uses find to locate all files (-type f) in the specified directory and its subdirectories. It then uses touch with the -t option to set the timestamp in the correct format (YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss). The use of {} + at the end is the most efficient way to handle large numbers of files.\n\nD) Incorrect: While this would work for a smaller number of files, it's inefficient and may fail for very large numbers of files due to command line length limitations.

All subspaces Si and Tj must have dimension 1. This can be deduced through the following reasoning:\n\n1. None of the subspaces can be zero-dimensional, as this would result in an all-1s row or column in the matrix M, which is not the case.\n\n2. No subspace Si can contain another Sj (and similarly for Ti and Tj), because for each pair, there exists a subspace orthogonal to one but not to the other.\n\n3. If any subspace, say S1, had dimension 2 or greater, then together with any other subspace (e.g., S2), it would span the entire 3-dimensional space. This would force some Tj to be orthogonal to everything, contradicting the matrix M.\n\n4.

This is only true for finite state spaces. For infinite spaces, you need the process to be positive recurrent, meaning the expected time to return to a state is finite. Here, starting from $1$, the expected time to return to $1$ is $\\\\sum jp\\_j$. Therefore, your proof goes in circles; in order for the process to have a stationary distribution, you need $\\\\sum jp\\_j\\<\\\\infty$, and in order to prove that, you use that the process has a stationary distribution.\n\nWhen the list $(p\\_1,p\\_2,\\\\dots)$ has too fat a tail, the process will never settle, and instead become more diffuse as time goes on."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider an infinite-state Markov chain with state space {1, 2, 3, ...} where from state i, the process moves to state 1 with probability pi and to state i+1 with probability 1-pi. Which of the following statements is true about the existence of a stationary distribution for this Markov chain?\n\nA) A stationary distribution always exists regardless of the values of pi.\nB) A stationary distribution exists if and only if the expected time to return to state 1 is finite.\nC) A stationary distribution exists if and only if the sum of all pi is equal to 1.\nD) A stationary distribution exists if and only if pi approaches 1 as i approaches infinity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The existence of a stationary distribution for an infinite-state Markov chain depends on whether the process is positive recurrent. For this specific chain, positive recurrence is equivalent to having a finite expected time to return to state 1, which is given by the sum \u03a3(i*pi). If this sum is finite, the process has a stationary distribution. If it's infinite, the process becomes more diffuse over time and doesn't settle into a stationary distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the existence of a stationary distribution depends on the specific values of pi. Option C is incorrect because the sum of pi doesn't determine the existence of a stationary distribution in this case. Option D is also incorrect; while pi approaching 1 might suggest a tendency to return to state 1, it doesn't guarantee a finite expected return time."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/23", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/311923", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/167044/"], "docs_id": 311923, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to make a button to sit up next to my sound/wireless/etc indicators which, when toggled, will change color and write the system time with the word \"begin\" to a file, then, when toggled again, return to its original color and record the system time with the word \"end.\" Ideally, the button would maintain it's toggled/untoggled state even if the system restarts.\n\nI can't imagine this would be a difficult program to make at all, but I am a bit new to Ubuntu and I'm not sure how to make a program work as an indicator, or how to make something maintain its state on system restart.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Looks like there is problem with the grub menu.\n\nStart by booting your ubuntu from a LiveCD or Live USB.

Physicists discovered antimatter experimentally, and the present standard model of physics posits the existence of antimatter. \n\nBUT to generate antimatter , one has to spend at least the energy of generating twice the mass, particle and antiparticle, and this can only happen in an accelerator which will have to be fed with a lot more extra energy so that the beams, colliding or hitting targets, can generate the particle antiparticle pair. They come in pairs because of conservations laws, lepton number for electrons and positrons, baryon number for protons and antiprotons.\n\nFusion utilizes the existing nuclear state taking advantage of the [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy) curve, rearanging existing particles not creating new ones.\n\nWith this in mind, :\n\n> can antimatter ever actually be superior to fusion in terms of being used to generate electricity?\n\nNo.\n\n> is trying to develop the most efficient form of fusion (possibly combining a fission cycle) the best way to go about it\n\nIn terms of energy in energy out yes, it is much more efficient.\n\n> if we can bypass engineering issues, in principle, antimatter electricity generation could one day be superior (more useful energy out for what we put in\n\nNot for cost, creating antiparticles is very costly.\n\nFor usefulness in space travel, if antimatter could be stored, which I find doubtful, it might be efficient.

To generate antimatter, we must spend at least twice the energy of the mass being created (particle and antiparticle). Additionally, this process requires accelerators that consume even more energy. Fusion, on the other hand, utilizes existing nuclear states and takes advantage of the binding energy curve, rearranging existing particles rather than creating new ones. This makes fusion much more efficient in terms of energy input versus output.

Then, the only times that we see $(1\\-x^2\\)^n$ appearing again is in justifying the uniform convergence of $Q\\_n$ outside any small interval around $0$, which will hold by essentially the same argument, and in the last inequality, which will not make a difference. \n\nHowever, there is more to it than \"it wouldn't change anything\". The idea of the proof by Rudin is that the convolution of two functions should preserve the best properties out of the two functions. One good example of this is the convolution with a smooth compactly supported function, which is a good way to prove uniform density of the smooth functions on $C^0(I)$, for example. So he strikes for a convolution with a polynomial.\n\nThe point is: if $f$ is a function (continuous, $L^1\\_{loc}$ or whatever depending on context), we expect that after making a convolution with a function $\\\\phi$ which is normalized as to have $\\\\int \\\\phi \\=1$, if the support is small enough and concentrated near $0$, then the convolution $\\\\widetilde{f}$ is near $f$ (think of a discrete averaging where $\\\\phi$ is a \"weight\", and the convolution at a point is the average of the function according to that weight centralized on the point. If we put more weight at the point, and less on its near values, then the average shouldn't shake things that much). This is easy to arrange for $C^{\\\\infty}$ functions, since we have bump functions. But here we would like to prove density of *polynomials*, which are not so malleable. With effect, we can't have a polynomial with compact support and integrating $1$ (we can't have non\\-trivial polynomials with compact support at all!).\n\nSo we try to emulate a compact support by taking a polynomial which is highly concentrated near the origin. The polynomial $p(x)\\=1\\-x^2$ is maybe the most trivial example of something concentrated near the origin. An important observation is that since the function is defined on $\\[0,1]$, what matters to our avering polynomial is its behaviour in $\\[\\-1,1]$, so the fact that $(1\\-x^2\\)$ explodes outside of $\\[\\-1,1]$ is irrelevant. Then we raise it to the power of $n$ since, being on $(\\-1,1\\)$, this will concentrate things even more near the origin (you can plot a few powers to try and see this). The estimates that Rudin do are to guarantee that everything goes well and represent the technical difficulty of not having compact support (also as small as desired). \n\nThe polynomial $1\\-x^4$ also satisfies the property that if we raise it to $n$, things will concentrate near the origin. The only difference is that it is less concentrated than $1\\-x^2$, so that the error you make with the convolution will probably be bigger than if you used $1\\-x^2$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem discussion:\n\nQuestion: In Rudin's proof of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, if we replace Qn = cn(1-x\u00b2)\u207f with Qn = cn(1-x\u2074)\u207f, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The proof would fail completely because (1-x\u2074)\u207f does not concentrate near the origin as effectively as (1-x\u00b2)\u207f.\n\nB) The proof would remain exactly the same with no changes required.\n\nC) The proof would require significant changes in all steps, including a complete revision of the convolution approach.\n\nD) The proof would require minor modifications, mainly in the estimates for cn and the analysis of uniform convergence, but the overall structure and approach would remain intact.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The use of (1-x\u2074)\u207f instead of (1-x\u00b2)\u207f would not drastically change the proof. The key properties that allow the proof to work are still present: (1-x\u2074)\u207f still concentrates near the origin as n increases, though less sharply than (1-x\u00b2)\u207f.

Promotes Open / Close: we can change the caching implementation if we want to use something else in the future (memcached, etc.)\n2. Lower cyclomatic complexity: less if statements\n3. Not mixing ASP.NET technology with data\\-access technology\n\n**Refutations / Concerns**\n\nHowever, I got the following refutations:\n\n1. We're not going to use a different caching technology in the foreseeable future.\n2. It's more lines of code (therefore it's more complex)\n3. You need to setup the dependencies (complexity is moved, not removed)\n4. There's already tonnes of code that uses `HttpContext.Current`, so this code does not follow the existing (anti\\-)pattern\n5. We're still \"using\" ASP.NET within data\\-access code.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nPersonally, I find that the pros outweigh the refutations, however, I would like to be able to address the refutations in order to help educate them.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Am I justified in making the refactoring (assuming we have time allocated for cleaning up code)?\n2. How do I respond to the various refutations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Am I justified in making the refactoring (assuming we have time allocated for cleaning up code)?\n\nAre you doing anything else in this code?\n\nIf not, this seems not worth the effort. Your peer is likely right that you aren't ever going to use other things \\- and that you should keep things consistent.\n\nIf you are, then cleaning this stuff up too seems like a clear benefit for minimal effort/risk (though you might need to add a default constructor that uses the `HttpContext` to make it minimal impact).\n\n> How do I respond to the various refutations?\n\n1. Yes, but that's no reason to couple something unnecessarily when it's so easy to do things better.\n2. More code is not necessarily more complex. In this case, it *is* more complex, but trivially so. And in exchange, it makes unit testing much easier and the code more flexible.\n3. Sure, it's just shifting the problem around, but it's shifting the problem to a more decoupled form. It lets you deal with parts of the problem in isolation rather than having a larger more unweildy problem.\n4. \"This is what we have always done\" is not an excuse to perpetuate bad code/design/anything. Yes, you should aim to keep code consistent, but in this case you should push for consistency with the decoupled pattern rather than the direct `HttpContext` access. Yes, that's more work \\- but it's the right thing to do. If your peer pushes that there's not time for all that now (and has an alternative that is better) then maybe agree to do it later (and add a ticket/bug/story to *actually* do it).\n5.

This balanced view addresses both the advantages and the team's concerns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the team stated they don't foresee using different caching technologies in the near future, so this isn't a compelling immediate need.\n\nOption B is not the best answer because while the refactoring does reduce if statements, this alone isn't the most significant benefit and doesn't address the team's concerns about overall complexity.\n\nOption D is incorrect on both counts: the refactoring doesn't align with existing patterns (which use HttpContext.Current directly) and it actually increases the total lines of code.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the architectural improvements (separation of concerns, testability) while acknowledging the trade-off of some added complexity, providing a balanced rationale for the refactoring."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/274522", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/72213/"], "docs_id": 274522, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently bought an EPSON Workforce WF\\-3540, which I'm using under Ubuntu 12\\.10 with the official driver provided by EPSON.

The top answer in the StackExchange thread indicates that the user experienced the same 0xFA error code when printing several 2-sided pages. Upon investigation, they found a paper jam in the back of the printer. This aligns with the original poster's suspicion that the problem was connected to the duplexer.

For now, forget about cross\\-validation. Your most serious problem is the training error increasing with the polynomial degree, while it should decrease (and become zero for big enough polynomial degree). Make the code without any traces of cross\\-validation. It will be much easier to check.\n2. If the error will not be reproduced (when you remove the cross\\-validation from your code, the training error suddenly decreases), then add the cross\\-validation part gradually (small chunks of code) until you find which part spoils the correct work, and understand why. Otherwise, go to step 3\\.\n3. Now you have a code without cross\\-validation, which does not work properly. Make the simulated data which ideally fits, say, quadratic polynomial, and check if it works properly. If it doesn't, try the linear polynomial. At the end you will have something very simple which does not work. You will probably be able to figure out why.\n4. Posting your whole code which does not work and asking people \"what did I do wrong\" is a bad idea. It means that you want people to debug your code instead of you. Why should they do it? You should first try to make your code **as small as possible** while still retaining the error. If you can remove something from your code, and the error is still here, then the code is NOT as simple as possible. If there is a part of your code which you did not try to remove, the code is NOT as simple as possible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When debugging code that produces unexpected results for diagnosing bias/variance in machine learning, which of the following approaches is most effective according to the expert advice given?\n\nA) Immediately post the entire code online and ask others to find the error for you\nB) Focus solely on the cross-validation part of the code, as this is likely where the error originates\nC) Simplify the code by removing cross-validation, then gradually reintroduce components while testing with simulated data\nD) Increase the polynomial degree to a much higher value, as the expert's graph shows higher degrees\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert advises a systematic debugging approach that involves simplifying the code by removing cross-validation, then gradually reintroducing components while testing with simulated data. This method allows for isolating the source of the error and understanding why it occurs. The expert specifically recommends forgetting about cross-validation initially, focusing on the training error, and using simulated data that fits simple polynomials to pinpoint the issue. This approach is more effective than posting the entire code for others to debug (A), focusing only on cross-validation (B), or arbitrarily increasing the polynomial degree (D)."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/14", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203386", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/115344/"], "docs_id": 203386, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question after reading about extended glob.\n\nAfter using `shopt -s extglob`,\n\nWhat is the difference in the following?\n\n```\n?(list): Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.\n\n*(list): Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.\n\n+(list): Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.\n\n@(list): Matches one of the given patterns.\n\n```\n\nYes, I have read the above description that accompanies them, but for practical purpose, I can't see situations where people would prefer ?(list) over \\*(list).

The reason for not reflecting and not emitting is that the enormous gravity of the black hole does not let anything including light, escape from it.\n\nHowever if scientists succeed in detecting the gravitational waves, then it will be possible to see some black holes in form of gravitational waves.

Black holes cannot be directly observed using conventional imaging techniques primarily because their extreme gravitational pull prevents any electromagnetic waves, including light, from escaping. This means that black holes neither reflect nor emit detectable amounts of electromagnetic radiation, making them essentially invisible to traditional observation methods that rely on capturing such waves.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while some black holes are indeed small, their size is not the primary reason for their invisibility. Many black holes are enormous, yet still cannot be directly imaged.\n\nOption B is partially true but incomplete.

Interestingly, I am not able to find evidence for this approach being actually flawed or wrong, still I also don't see anyone using it in my field of research.\nI am aware that one possibility to overcome the problem is combining wind speed and direction and calculate a GLM model including a northward and eastward wind component. But I am interested in whether the GAM approach would also give accurate results or is problematic in any way and if so, why.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some misconceptions in your question that I need to clear up before getting to the answer.\n\nThe null hypothesis $H\\_0$ in a statistical test is always the claim you want to argue against. The alternative hypothesis $H\\_1$ is the claim you hope to be true.\n\nThe null and the alternative need to be\n\n1. mutually exclusive (no overlap)\n2. collectively exhaustive (partition the parameter space)\n3. the equality sign ($\\=$, $\\\\ge$, or $\\\\le$) almost always appears in the null.\n\nSo your first test should have $H\\_0: \\\\mu \\\\le 0$ and $H\\_1: \\\\mu \\> 0$.\n\nYour second test should have $H\\_0: \\\\mu \\= 0$ and $H\\_1: \\\\mu \\\\ne 0$.\n\nThe p\\-value is the probability of seeing the observed mean (or something even more extreme) if the null hypothesis was true. Then we apply the rule \u201creject the null when the p\\-value is small.\u201d The basic idea is that if seeing a big mean is unlikely if the null was true, the null is likely to be false.\n\nThere is a slight complication in the first test. The null is a composite one: it's an interval rather than a single point. So we will have to calculate the probability when $\\\\mu\\=0$, then when $\\\\mu \\=\\-1$, and also everywhere else below zero, since all those points are inside the null. But that\u2019s an infinite number of points! What we do instead is to calculate the probability at the most extreme point of the null hypothesis, closest to alternative parameter space, which is at $\\\\mu \\= 0$. This means that the p\\-value is exact only for $\\\\mu\\=0$. If $\\\\mu\\<0$, then our p\\-value is just a conservative bound on the type I error rate (the error being finding a negative effect when there is none). In other words, if the true effect is negative, then finding a false positive result is even less likely than 5% (or whatever value of $\\\\alpha$ your question requires). This is also the reason why statistics packages will express the one\\-sided null as $\\\\mu\\=0$ rather than $\\\\mu \\\\le 0$, which is technically correct, but confusing notation.\n\nNow for your question. For both one\\-sided and two\\-sided tests, we calculate the p\\-value with $\\\\mu\\=0$. Suppose you observe a mean of $u\\>0$. With a two\\-sided test, you need to calculate $\\\\Pr(\\\\bar X \\\\ge u \\\\vert \\\\mu\\=0\\)$ and $\\\\Pr(\\\\bar X\n\\\\le \\-u \\\\vert \\\\mu\\=0\\)$, since both kinds of extreme values constitute evidence against that null.\n\nWith a one\\-sided test, seeing a mean that\u2019s less than $\\-k$ doesn\u2019t count as evidence against the null, so we only calculate $\\\\Pr(\\\\bar X \\\\ge u \\\\vert \\\\mu\\=0\\)$. This is why the p\\-value is larger in the two\\-sided case, which means it\u2019s easier to reject in the one\\-sided case.\n\nAnother way to put this is that a two\\-sided test is just two one\\-sided tests cobbled together (a superiority and an inferiority one)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is testing the effect of a new drug on blood pressure.

The documentation suggests that any permutation of any of the cosets Hx is an automorphism of the graph, forming a subgroup N = S\u2088\u00b9\u2075. These cosets likely form a system of imprimitivity for X, making N normal in X. This leads to the structure X = S\u2081\u2085 \u2240 P, where P is a transitive permutation group of degree 15. Given that P has A\u2086 as a composition factor and order 720, it must be S\u2086. \n\nA is incorrect because the normal subgroup is S\u2088\u00b9\u2075, not A\u2088\u00b9\u2075. \nB is speculative and not directly supported by the given information. \nD is incorrect as A\u2088\u00b9\u2075 doesn't act directly on S\u2085; it's part of the automorphism group structure of the resulting graph."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/15", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/406838", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/500276/"], "docs_id": 406838, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I had this [answer](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/406559/how-can-i-make-sure-the-question-im-going-to-post-is-not-going-to-be-duplicate/406560#406560) ([screenshot for \\<10K](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PiiCu.png)) deleted by a moderator.\n\nI raised a flag to try and get some clarification on why it was deleted, but no soap.

So, more than deriving the MLEs (which is straightforward), I would say that this is a good example in order to examine whether pooling samples (**\"unite and conquer\"?**) is more beneficial than keeping the samples separate (**\"divide and conquer\"?**). But \"more beneficial\" according to which criteria? \n\nWe will discuss them as we go along.\n\nNote that we need both sample sizes to be larger than unity, $n\\_1 \\>1, n\\_2 \\> 1$, otherwise the variance estimator will equal zero.\n\nIf we keep the samples separate we will obtain\n\n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}v\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}(v\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v)^2$$\n\nand \n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}w\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}(w\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w)^2$$\n\nThe MLEs for the means will be unbiased, efficient, consistent and asymptotically normal.\n\nThe variance estimators will be biased, consistent and asymptotically normal (see [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/105337/asymptotic-distribution-of-sample-variance-of-non-normal-sample), which holds in general, even for normal samples).\n\nSince we have bias here, it is an easy thought to turn to Mean Squared Error.

The pooled estimator for \u03c32 will indeed have a smaller MSE than the separate sample estimators, as shown by the condition (1/n1 + 1/n2 < 2) being satisfied for any n1, n2 > 1. However, because n1 \u2260 n2, the pooled estimator for \u03c32 will not follow a Gamma distribution. It will instead have a more complex distribution that can be approximated by its asymptotic normal distribution for large sample sizes. This makes option C the correct answer.

I planed to use power transformers from 110 to 220, but learned that I have NEMA 10\\-30 outlet in my home, which, from what I understood, is 220V (but with 110V volts on the ground pin?!).\n\nAnyhow, is there (or can I assemble) and adapter from NEMA 10\\-30 to European 220V and will it work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A NEMA 10\\-30 is 2 hots and a grounded neutral conductor, with 110V H1\\-N and H2\\-N and 240V H1\\-H2, all at 60Hz. Whether an European appliance will accept it depends on the type of appliance:\n\n* Appliances with fractional HP motors, or especially AC synchronous (timing) motors, will likely not run correctly due to the frequency difference as motor synchronous RPMs will change as a result.\n* Grounded (IEC Class I, look for the ground symbol) appliances cannot be safely connected to a NEMA 10 outlet due to the lack of an equipment grounding conductor. (They *can* be connected to a NEMA 14 or NEMA 6 outlet with the correct adapter, though, provided that mains frequency is not an issue.)\n* Some older Class 0 appliances rely on plug polarization and the grounding of the neutral to be safe \\-\\- this is common in old consumer audio gear. These appliances also *cannot* be safely connected to a US 240V outlet of *any* type (whether it be a NEMA 6, a NEMA 10, or a NEMA 14\\) due to the lack of a grounded reference conductor in the 240V section of the circuit. I'd junk them anyway.\n* Doubly insulated (IEC Class II, look for the square within a square symbol) appliances (that do not have an AC motor in them) and Class II power supplies (wall warts, laptop bricks, etal) don't care about how the mains is presented to them, and thus can safely be hooked up to a pair of opposite leg hots, even if they are 240V only. The internal transformer will be built more robustly for 50Hz operation than it needs to be for 60Hz, so the frequency change is a non\\-issue.\n* Older instruments and some other types of (older) electronic equipment intended for worldwide circulation will have a jumper link, back\\-panel switch (the infamous little red switch), or other documented means to change over from 120 to 240V \\-\\- this covers older computer power supplies, for instance. The presence of an IEC\\-type inlet and detachable (computer type) power cord, instead of a fixed power cord, is a good (albeit not universal) sign to look for a 120\\-240V changeover function. Again, the frequency change is not an issue in an all\\-electronic device.\n* Newer Class II power supplies and electronic equipment/instrumentation have \"universal inputs\", and are capable of 120, 208, or 220/240VAC operation without any twiddling \\-\\- this capability will be marked on the device's safety label."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An American homeowner with a NEMA 10-30 outlet wants to use their European 220V appliances.

Only doubly insulated (IEC Class II) appliances without AC motors can be safely connected to a NEMA 10-30 outlet with an appropriate adapter. This is because:\n\n1. IEC Class II appliances don't require a ground connection and are designed to work with various input voltages.\n2. The absence of an AC motor means the frequency difference (50Hz vs 60Hz) won't affect the appliance's operation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all European 220V appliances are compatible with NEMA 10-30 outlets due to grounding and frequency issues.\n\nOption C is wrong because NEMA 10-30 outlets lack a proper equipment grounding conductor, making them unsafe for IEC Class I appliances.\n\nOption D is incorrect because appliances with fractional HP motors will likely not run correctly due to the frequency difference between Europe (50Hz) and the US (60Hz), which affects motor synchronous RPMs."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/29", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/115577", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/36453/"], "docs_id": 115577, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have setup QGIS server using **[this](http://anitagraser.com/2012/03/30/qgis-server-on-ubuntu-step-by-step/)** guide sucessfully and would now like to setup qgis\\-web\\-client alongside it.\n\nMy QGIS server folder is: **/usr/lib/cgi\\-bin**\n\nFor qgis\\-web\\-client I have followed the qgis\\-web\\-client readme **[here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client)** and have cloned from github (as recommended) here:\n\n**/home/web/qgis\\-web\\-client**\n\nI am now stuck with editing the qgis\\-web\\-client.conf file to get things working correctly.

The -a flag is used to specify the attachment file, followed by the -s flag for the subject, and finally the recipient's email address.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it attempts to use the contents of the PDF file as the body of the email, rather than attaching it.\n\nOption C is close but unnecessarily complicated. While it would work, it adds an extra step of including a message body, which wasn't specified in the question.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses -c, which is for carbon copy recipients, instead of -a for attachments."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/62532388", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/6613790/"], "docs_id": 62532388, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have multiple (Java) Azure Functions that we deploy multiple times (for now \\~10, in the future might be hundreds) using Terraform (to different customers' environments).\n\nThese functions are being build and deployed using our CI/CD pipeline. At the end of the pipeline, we have a ZIP file that we put in Azure Blob Storage (eg myFunction\\-latest.zip).\n\nWhen we deploy a function (using Terraform), we supply a SAS\\-URL (valid for a long time) to this zip (myFunction\\-latest.zip) in the \"WEBSITE\\_RUN\\_FROM\\_PACKAGE\" appsettings of the function.\nThis works great. Using the SAS\\-url, the function pulls the zip from BLOB\\-storage and starts the function.\n\nMy question is how we should handle updates to the Function's source. Our CI/CD will overwrite the myFunction\\-latest.zip in blob storage, but how will these (potentially hundreds) functions know it changed? According to [the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies#trigger-syncing), we need to 'sync triggers'. Syncing triggers can be done by\n\n1. Calling the function's URL on a specific endpoint using it's 'master key'.\n2. Calling the Azure Resource Manager API on a specific endpoint. Authentication could be done using a managed identity.\n3. Restarting the function (in the Azure Portal).\n\nI have several options to do this, which would be best? We would like a 'pull\\-based' approach so that we don't have to push changes to 100's of clients' environments.\n\n1. On deployment, Terraform could read/calculate the blob's hash, and add it to the appsettings. This would effectively restart the function when the content of the function changed. However, we would need to run Terraform plan/apply for every client, every time a function app changes. Furthermore, we would need standing access to the (customer's) environment we deploy the functions in.\n2. We can have a seperate 'management' function (per customer environment) that periodically polls all the blobs and check if they changed (based on hash or updatedAt field). This management function has an identity that has access to sync the triggers of all the functions in that environment. I think this can work.\n3. In the function itself, the function should poll the SAS\\-URL, and check whether it changed (based on hash or updatedAt field). If the function notices the zip changed, he should 'sync triggers' after the function has run.\n\nWhat would be the best option? I am afraid of the overhead of using option 3, so I'm thinking of going with option 2\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Option two is a good option to consider. Like you've mentioned, it would have sufficient permissions to do its job without external services needed access to the environment.\n\nYou could enhance it to avoid polling (especially if you don't see lots of updates on a regular basis or want near instant updates) by deploying a logic app in each customer environment that implements the [webhook trigger pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app#wait-and-listen-for-new-data-or-events-with-the-webhook-trigger-pattern).\n\nAs per the above doc, the Custom API (could be a [durable function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp)) would be running in your environment, which all customer logic apps would subscribe to.\n\nWhen a newer version of your function app package is uploaded, your CI/CD pipeline would trigger your Custom API, which in turn would trigger all the subscribed Logic Apps.\n\nThese Logic Apps would just call *Sync Triggers* on their respective function apps.\n\nYou could implement a similar function as well for option three using [durable functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp) and its [external events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-external-events?tabs=csharp) feature as well, with security in place.\n\n---\n\n> The below is currently in [Public Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)\n\nAnother interesting way to achieve this is using [Azure Event Grid Partner Topics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/partner-topics-overview). You would have [setup the Event Grid Partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/partner-onboarding-overview) side of things in your subscription and have a site/form where your customers would go to register for events , thereby creating a partner topic in their subscription.\n\nThen a logic app or function could listen to this topic for events."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is deploying multiple Java Azure Functions to different customer environments using Terraform. They want to implement an efficient method for updating these functions across potentially hundreds of client environments. Which of the following approaches would be the most suitable for achieving this while maintaining a pull-based strategy and minimizing direct access to customer environments?\n\nA) Use Terraform to read the blob's hash and add it to the function's appsettings, effectively restarting the function when its content changes.\n\nB) Implement a separate management function in each customer environment that periodically polls all blobs to check for changes and syncs triggers when updates are detected.\n\nC) Modify each function to poll its own SAS-URL, check for changes, and self-update by syncing triggers after each execution.\n\nD) Deploy a Logic App in each customer environment that subscribes to a webhook trigger pattern, allowing for near-instant updates without constant polling.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most suitable approach for this scenario. It offers several advantages:\n\n1. Pull-based strategy: The Logic App in each customer environment subscribes to updates, maintaining a pull-based approach.\n2. Efficiency: It avoids constant polling, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.\n3. Near real-time updates: The webhook trigger pattern allows for quick notification of updates.\n4. Minimal access requirements: This approach doesn't require standing access to customer environments.\n5. Scalability: It can easily handle updates across hundreds of client environments.\n6. Separation of concerns: The update mechanism is separate from the function code.\n\nOption A requires running Terraform for every client on each update, which is not scalable. Option B introduces unnecessary polling and potential delays. Option C puts the update logic within each function, potentially increasing complexity and resource usage. The Logic App approach (D) provides the best balance of efficiency, scalability, and minimal intrusion into customer environments."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/16", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/736703", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/249986/"], "docs_id": 736703, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new to Domains...\nHave physical DC. created there 10 users.\nHave virtualized TS on other PC, joined to domain, all OK.\nDC can see and manage the TS.\n...But still I am unable to allow my domain users (created on DC) to connect to TS through RDP ..

If so, that's your problem. Members of the domain Remote Desktop Users group are not automatically members of the local Remote Desktop Users group on your RDS server. You need to add the domain Remote Desktop Users group to the local Remote Desktop Users group on the server.\n\nAdditionally, the domain Remote Desktop Users is meant to grant RDS access to users for the Domain Controller, not for access to RDS servers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has set up a domain controller (DC) and a terminal server (TS) in a Windows Server 2012 environment. Domain users created on the DC cannot connect to the TS via RDP, despite being members of the domain Remote Desktop Users group. What is the most likely cause of this issue and the correct solution?\n\nA) The domain users need to be added to the local Administrators group on the TS.\nB) The domain Remote Desktop Users group needs to be added to the local Remote Desktop Users group on the TS.\nC) RDP access needs to be enabled in the Windows Firewall on the TS.\nD) The domain users need to be granted explicit \"Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services\" rights in Group Policy.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is that the domain Remote Desktop Users group membership does not automatically grant access to RDP on the terminal server. The correct solution is to add the domain Remote Desktop Users group to the local Remote Desktop Users group on the terminal server. This ensures that domain users who are members of the domain Remote Desktop Users group will have the necessary permissions to connect via RDP to the terminal server.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding users to the Administrators group would grant too many privileges and is not a secure practice.\nOption C is unlikely to be the cause if the Administrator can connect via RDP.\nOption D is not necessary if the users are already members of the Remote Desktop Users group."}}
