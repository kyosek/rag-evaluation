The top answer in the documentation explicitly mentions this as a likely cause, suggesting to use the command `LC_ALL=c cat -vet starter.sh` to reveal non-ASCII characters. Fancy quotes are often automatically inserted by text editors on macOS, which explains why the script works in an online simulator but fails on macOS. This issue requires critical thinking to diagnose, as it's not immediately obvious from the script's appearance.

Despite following the steps outlined in a guide and successfully adding the Ubuntu machine to the \"Users and Computers\" option in Active Directory, the login window is not appearing on the Ubuntu client. What is the most likely underlying cause of this issue?\n\nA) Incompatibility between Ubuntu 12.10's authentication modules and Windows Server 2008's Kerberos implementation\nB) Misconfiguration of the Domain Name System (DNS) settings on the Ubuntu client\nC) Failure to properly configure the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on the Ubuntu system\nD) Insufficient permissions granted to the Ubuntu client account in Active Directory\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of knowledge about Linux-Windows integration. The most likely cause of the login window not appearing, despite the Ubuntu client being added to Active Directory, is a misconfiguration of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on the Ubuntu system.\n\nPAM is crucial for integrating Linux systems with Active Directory, as it handles authentication processes. If PAM is not correctly configured, it can prevent the proper display of the login window, even if the machine is successfully added to AD.\n\nOption A is a distractor based on the misconception that version incompatibility is always the root cause of integration issues. While possible, it's less likely given that the Ubuntu client was successfully added to AD.\n\nOption B is plausible as DNS issues can cause authentication problems, but it's less likely to prevent the login window from appearing entirely.\n\nOption D represents a common misconception that AD permissions are the primary factor in client integration issues, when in fact, client-side configurations often play a more significant role in this scenario.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex integration scenario, consider multiple potential causes, and identify the most probable root cause based on the symptoms described."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/13", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/198163", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/5636/"], "docs_id": 198163, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Using arcgis desktop 10\\.3\\.1 I have a script which uses a search cursor to append values to a list and then use min() to find the smallest integer. The variable is then used in a script. The Feature class has 200,000 rows and the script takes a very long time to complete. Is there a way to do this quicker? At the moment I think I would just do it by hand rather than write a script due to the length of time it takes.\n\n```py\nimport arcpy\nfc = arcpy.env.workspace = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nXfield = \"XKoordInt\"\ncursor = arcpy.SearchCursor(fc)\nListVal = []\nfor row in cursor:\n    ListVal.append(row.getValue(Xfield))\nvalue = min(ListVal)-20\nprint value\nexpression = \"(!XKoordInt!-{0})/20\".format(value)\narcpy.CalculateField_management (fc, \"Matrix_Z\" ,expression, \"PYTHON\")\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can see several things that may be causing your script to be slow. The thing that is likely being very slow is the `arcpy.CalculateField_management()` function. You should use a cursor, it will by several magnitudes faster. Also, you said you are using ArcGIS Desktop 10\\.3\\.1, but you're using the old ArcGIS 10\\.0 style cursors, which are also much slower.\n\nThe min() operation even on a a list of 200K will be pretty quick. You can verify this by running this small snippet; it happens in the blink of an eye:\n\n```\n>>> min(range(200000)) # will return 0, but is still checking a list of 200,000 values very quickly\n\n```\n\nSee if this is any faster:\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nfc = arcpy.env.workspace = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nXfield = \"XKoordInt\"\nwith arcpy.da.SearchCursor(fc, [Xfield]) as rows:\n    ListVal = [r[0] for r in rows]\n\nvalue = min(ListVal) - 20\nprint value\n\n# now update\nwith arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, [Xfield, 'Matrix_Z']) as rows:\n    for r in rows:\n        if r[0] is not None:\n            r[1] = (r[0] - value) / 20.0\n            rows.updateRow(r)\n\n```\n\nEDIT:\n\nI ran some timing tests and as I suspected, the field calculator took almost twice as long as the new style cursor. Interestingly, the old style cursor was \\~3x slower than the field calculator. I created 200,000 random points and used the same field names.\n\nA decorator function was used to time each function (may be some slight overhead in the setup and tear down of functions, so maybe the [timeit](https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html) module would be a little more accurate to test snippets).\n\nHere are the results:\n\n```\nGetting the values with the old style cursor: 0:00:19.23 \nGetting values with the new style cursor: 0:00:02.50 \nGetting values with the new style cursor + an order by sql statement: 0:00:00.02\n\nAnd the calculations: \n\nfield calculator: 0:00:14.21 \nold style update cursor: 0:00:42.47 \nnew style cursor: 0:00:08.71\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I used (broke everything down to individual functions to use the `timeit` decorator):\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nimport datetime\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef timeit(function):\n    \"\"\"will time a function's execution time\n    Required:\n        function -- full namespace for a function\n    Optional:\n        args -- list of arguments for function\n        kwargs -- keyword arguments for function\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        st = datetime.datetime.now()\n        output = function(*args, **kwargs)\n        elapsed = str(datetime.datetime.now()-st)[:-4]\n        if hasattr(function, 'im_class'):\n            fname = '.'.join([function.im_class.__name__, function.__name__])\n        else:\n            fname = function.__name__\n        print'\"{0}\" from {1} Complete -

As with that list, there should be some rules.\u00a0\n\n1. **The inequality should not be too well known.** This is to rule out things like Cauchy\\-Schwarz or the Sobolev inequalities. The inequality should be unfamiliar to a majority of mathematicians.\n2. **The\u00a0inequality should represent research level mathematics.** This is taken straight from the other list, and feels like a good rule.\n3. **The inequality should be important.**\u00a0\u00a0Since it is easier to come up with inequalities versus exact formulas, this should be more restrictive than in the other list. The idea is to have inequalities which played an important role in the development of some field.\n4. **An answer can be a class of inequalities.** As noted in the comments, often what is important is a family of inequalities which all convey the same idea but where no single result is *the* fundamental example. This is perfectly acceptable, and perhaps even encouraged since any such examples will likely have lots of applications.\n\nTo give an idea of what I mean, let me give an example which I think satisfies the first three criteria; the Li\\-Yau estimate.\n\nThe Li\\-Yau inequality is the estimate $$ \\\\Delta \\\\ln u \\\\geq \\- \\\\frac{\n n}{ 2t}.$$\n\nHere $u: M \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^\\+ $ is a non\\-negative solution to the heat equation\n$ \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\= \\\\Delta u, $ $(M^n,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with non\\-negative Ricci curvature and $\\\\Delta$ is the Laplace\\-Beltrami operator.\n\nThis inequality plays a very important role in geometric analysis. It provides a differential Harnack inequality to solutions to the heat equation, which integrates out to the standard Harnack estimate.\nThere are many results strengthening the original inequality or adapting it to a different setting. There are also results which are not generalizations of the original inequality but which bear its influence.\u00a0For instance, Hamilton proved a tensor version of the Li\\-Yau inequality for a manifold which has non\\-negative sectional curvature and evolves by Ricci flow. Furthermore, one of Perelman's important breakthroughs was to prove a version of the Hamilton\\-Li\\-Yau inequality for a solution to time\\-reversed heat flow when the metric evolves by Ricci flow. These results are not at all corollaries of the original Li\\-Yau estimate, but they are similar in spirit.\u00a0\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The class of [concentration of measure inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure) is a fundamental tool in modern probability (and any field that uses probability, e.g., random matrix theory, theoretical computer science, statistics, high\\-dimensional geometry, combinatorics, etc.). As explained in [this blog post of Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3712), these are basic ways in which one \"upper bounds the probability of something bad\", and often the bounds are exponential or even gaussian in nature when one is far away from the mean (or median) and there are many independent (or somewhat independent) variables involved.

After the first concave lens, the ray should diverge instead of converge.\n\nThere are few disadvantage of using lens to create such large angle. (1\\) The angular resolution decrease, assuming the projector are of the same distance from the screen. (2\\) The brightness decrease by the same factor. (3\\) To obtaining such large angle using lens will cause severe [dispersion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_%28optics%29), that is the color of each pixel now spreading out and might overlap with other pixel. (4\\) The image at the edges would be distorted by most lens.\n\nThe brightness is usually adjustable, but not the angular resolution. But your aim seems to be have a larger image in a screen so it is not a problem whatever scheme you are using. So the (3\\) and (4\\) are the problems caused by using lens.\n\nIf you want a large image, my suggestion is to simply move your projector further away from the screen.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Brightness decrease: The documentation states, \"The brightness decrease by the same factor.\" This is due to the same amount of light being spread over a larger area.\n\n2. Severe color dispersion: The answer mentions \"severe dispersion, that is the color of each pixel now spreading out and might overlap with other pixel.\" This is a critical optical challenge when attempting to achieve such a large angle using lenses.\n\n3. Minimal impact on image distortion: While the documentation does mention that \"The image at the edges would be distorted by most lens,\" this is not as severe as the other two issues highlighted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because angular resolution would decrease, not improve.

Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the information in the documentation?\n\nA) The phrase originated in American English in the 1920s and was later adopted by other languages.\nB) The concept behind the phrase has existed for centuries, but the exact wording emerged in English literature in the mid-19th century.\nC) The phrase was first used by Shakespeare and then spread to other languages through translations of his works.\nD) The expression developed independently in multiple languages due to the universal nature of fly behavior.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation provides evidence that supports option B as the best conclusion. While the concept of using flies metaphorically to represent unseen observers has existed for centuries (as evidenced by the quote from Romeo and Juliet from 1595), the exact phrase \"a fly on the wall\" in its idiomatic sense first appears in English literature in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the exact phrase \"a fly on the wall\" with the intended idiomatic meaning is found in Julia Cecilia Stretton's novel \"Woman's Devotion\" from 1855. Following this, there are several instances of the phrase being used in novels by female writers between 1855 and 1907, indicating its growing popularity in English literature.\n\nThe documentation also shows that similar concepts existed earlier (such as \"would I were a fly\" in various contexts), but these did not use the exact \"fly on the wall\" phrasing. Additionally, while the concept may exist in other languages (as mentioned with the Brazilian Portuguese example), the evidence suggests that the specific English phrasing emerged and gained popularity in the mid to late 19th century.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple pieces of information from the documentation, analysis of the chronology of phrase usage, and application of critical thinking to draw a conclusion about the phrase's origins, thus meeting the criteria for a high-quality, challenging multiple-choice question."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/12/21", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/558337", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/387196/"], "docs_id": 558337, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some text file that looks like:\n\n```\nk-opp- -l fi -s linux -a BHHHHH7 -d 22.22.222.22 -g ai\nk-opp- -l fi -s linux -a BHHHHH8 -d 222.22.22.22 -g ai\nk-opp- -l fi -s linux -a BHHHHH9 -d 222.222.22.222 -g ai\n\n```\n\nand I have some script I made:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfile=list.txt\nwhile read line\ndo\n  echo $line |grep -o -P '(?<=-a).*(?=-d)' >>somefile.txt\n  $line <checkcon.sh >>somefile.txt\ndone < \"$file\"\n\n```\n\nthis script `ssh`es to my machines and runs a second script and takes some info that I need.\n\nThe **problem** that the output looks like:\n\n```\nBHHHHH7 \neth:    inet 22.22.222.22\nBHHHHH8 \neth:    inet 222.22.22.22\nBHHHHH8 \neth:    inet 222.222.22.222\n\n```\n\nwhat I want to do this :\n\n```\nBHHHHH7 eth:    inet 22.22.222.22\nBHHHHH8 eth:    inet 222.22.22.22\n...continues..\n\n```\n\nAnybody know how I can make my script print in one line.\nThanks in advance :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Use command substitution:\n\n```\necho \"$(echo $line |grep -o -P '(?<=-a).*(?=-d)' ) $(echo abc)\" >> some_file_to_append_next_line_to\n\n```\n\nYou will have to change the 2nd part, I changed it so it could be tested, without having to run the command from the data.\n\nThe basic form is:\n\n```\ncommand4 \"$(command1) $(command2)\" \"$(command3)\"\n\n```\n\nHere `command1` and `command2` are run.

The script currently outputs information on separate lines, but the engineer wants to consolidate the output. Given the current script and desired output format, which modification would most effectively achieve the goal while maintaining security and efficiency?\n\nA) Replace the while loop with a sed command to process the entire file at once and format the output in a single line\nB) Modify the grep command to include both the machine ID and connection information in a single regex pattern\nC) Use command substitution to combine the grep output with the SSH command result on a single line\nD) Implement awk to process the input file and format the output in one pass\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution is to use command substitution (option C). This approach directly addresses the problem by combining the output of multiple commands on a single line, which is exactly what the engineer is trying to achieve. It maintains the existing script structure while making a minimal, targeted change to consolidate the output.\n\nOption A (using sed) would require a significant rewrite of the script and might not handle the SSH command execution properly. Option B (modifying grep) wouldn't solve the issue of combining the grep output with the SSH command result. Option D (using awk) could potentially work but would be more complex and require rewriting the entire script logic.\n\nThe command substitution approach also maintains security by not fundamentally changing how commands are executed, which is crucial when dealing with SSH connections. It's efficient as it doesn't introduce any unnecessary processing overhead.\n\nFurthermore, this solution demonstrates an understanding of shell scripting concepts, particularly the use of command substitution to manipulate output, which is a key skill in DevOps and system administration.

This solution addresses the complexity of nested groups shown in the image and aligns with the question's requirement to do this programmatically using Python.\n\nOption A is inefficient as it would iterate through all layers, including those not in the target group. Option B is incorrect because QgsLayerTreeView.setLayerVisible() is typically used for individual layers, not groups. Option D introduces unnecessary complexity by modifying metadata and doesn't directly address the checkbox toggling requirement.\n\nThe recursive approach (Option C) allows for navigating the hierarchical structure of layer groups, handling nested subgroups, and directly manipulating the visibility state of the target group.

That is, a vector is defined as a certain representation of the rotation group.\n\nThat said, however, the use of the term vector clearly is just a matter of convention. Why vectors in nonrelativistic and relativistic physics are treated differently is to some extent a matter of sociology, but there can also be more concrete reasons for doing so.\n\nFirst, the philosophy whereby physical laws are derived from their symmetries, and not vice versa, was historically only introduced along with relativity, hence the focus on manifest Lorentz invariance in relativity. Second, it is a mathematical fact that the classification of representations of the Galilei group is much more tricky than the same problem for the Lorentz group (the reason being that the Galilei group is not semisimple). See for instance [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/39/29/026): the Galilei group has not only 3\\-vectors, but also two different types of 4\\-vectors, and 5\\-vectors, among others. The construction of invariants for a given representation is likewise a nontrivial task. I believe this is the main practical reason why representations of the Galilei group and their use are much less frequently discussed than those of the Lorentz group.\n\nTo answer the original question, velocity is a vector under rotations.

The documentation states that velocity is not a simple vector under all Galilean transformations, particularly boosts, where it doesn't transform trivially.\n\n2.

It doesn't really have anything to do with whether the model is nonlinear or if you use a mixed model. The easiest way to get your model returned fitted with level means coding instead of reference level coding is to suppress the intercept when you have a factor variable. In R, this can be done with either `+0` or `-1`. Consider: \n\n```\nset.seed(123)                 # this makes the example exactly reproducible\nx = runif(30, min=0, max=10)  # x is a continuous variable\ng = as.factor(sample(rep(c(\"C\",\"T\"), 15), 30, replace=F))  # g is categorical\ny = 3 + .3*x + 2*ifelse(g==\"T\",1,0) + rnorm(30)            \n\n## this is the typical way, which uses reference level coding:  \nmod.refL = lm(y~x+g)\nsummary(mod.refL)\n# ...\n# Coefficients:\n#             Estimate Std.

The question mentions wanting to \"apply a curve to the effects of an ordinal variable,\" which aligns well with GAM's ability to fit smooth functions to predictor variables.\n\n2.

The correct answer, C, reflects the author's use of personification and irony to convey a complex idea.\n\nThe ulcer growing in \"size and authority\" is a metaphorical expression. While it literally grows in size, the concept of it gaining authority is a personification that symbolizes how the health issue has come to dominate the character's life. This is directly tied to his career \"as an interpreter of America to provincial and ignorant notables from backwaters of civilization.\"\n\nThe phrase is ironic because while the character sees himself as superior (interpreting America to \"ignorant notables\"), his own life is being controlled by a stress-induced health problem. This juxtaposition highlights the destructive nature of his lifestyle and career, subtly critiquing the very American culture he's promoting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it takes the personification too literally.

This API will be used internally to perform some server side actions that were triggered by AJAX calls.\n\nTo make things easier for me, I thought of using the Chain\\-of\\-Command/Responsibility pattern.\n\nHere are more details about what I want to do: \n\nI am creating a \"dashboard\" where admins of my app will be able to update information (meta data) about items stored in a database. \n\nTo make things easy and simple for the admins, I chose to use AJAX. So, if an admin wants to delete an item, (s)he clicks on the \"delete button\". A POST request is then sent to `edit.php` page with all the information needed to perform the deletion (action : delete, element : link, id : xx ...). Where `action`, `element` and of course `id` can change. \n\nThis is why I opted for a mini\\-API that will, depending on the `action` and the `element` data, call a different function from a different class. \n\nNow, to implement the API, I decided to use Chain\\-of\\-Responsibility design pattern. Why? Because I can easily add, delete or update classes without having to modify the API itself. \n\nIs the Chain of Responsibility design pattern good fit for my case? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The idea of the chain\\-of\\-command pattern is to build a chain of handlers and pass a command along this chain until one of the handlers handles the command. This behavior is typically found in event processing, where, say, a click event from a UI button bubbles up the hierarchy of UI elements till it reaches an element that has a respective handler attached. This handler can then decided whether it handles the command \\-\\- effectively ending the event processing \\-\\- or not \\-\\- in which case the event is propagated further along the chain.\n\nLet's now assume we use that pattern for you web API. What you describe sounds like a classical [CRUD(L)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) interface to me, where your actions are (a subset of) create, read, update, and delete. You say you have delete requests and I'm assume that you want some kind of update requests, too. Let's assume further that you wrote respective handlers **hupd** and **hdel** for these kinds requests. Following the chain\\-of\\-command pattern, you then build the chain **\\[hupd,hdel]** to handle requests to your API. What happens is that every update request passed into the chain gets immediately handled by **hupd**, while every delete request is rejected by **hupd** and passed along to **hdel**, which handles it. This behavior shows a fixed mapping between actions and handlers that actually makes the chain unnecessary. (In fact, the chain even lowers your system's performance, because of the check and the passing along of every delete request). Why does this happen? Because there are no two handlers responsible for different subsets of requests with the same action type. What you really want to have here is a direct mapping **\\[\"update\" \\=\\> hupd, \"delete\" \\=\\> hdel]** and a dispatcher that takes respective requests and passes them directly to the respective handler. Such a design can still be extendible with regard to new actions, if there is a dynamic registry holding the mapping.\n\nNow you could say, that you want to have different handlers for, say, the deletion of elements of type A and B. What gives you handlers for subsets of requests with the same action type. But once again, you have a direct and fixed mapping between the handlers and the element type, i.e., you can repeatedly dispatch requests based on the target element type. This gives you a two\\-level dispatch, where with a chain\\-of\\-command you would pass the request through number\\-of\\-actions times number\\-of\\-element\\-types handlers, in the worst case.\n\n*Conclusion:* I would not recommend the chain\\-of\\-command pattern to implement this kind of API. For the pattern to have value, you need a scenario where you want to dynamically add and remove handlers and where the condition of when a handler actually handles an event is not expressible by a simple mapping from constants."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about implementing an API using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software architect is designing an extensible API for a content management system that needs to handle various types of content (articles, images, videos) with different actions (create, update, delete, publish).

Flexibility: A two-level dispatch system with dynamic registries allows for easy addition of new content types and actions without modifying existing code, addressing the extensibility requirement.\n\n2.

The name \"Fan-hat-ic\" is a pun combining \"fan\" (as in a devoted follower) and \"hat,\" alluding to fanatical behavior.\n\nOption A most effectively captures the essence of the \"Fan-hat-ic\" concept because:\n\n1. It incorporates the idea of a distinctive headwear (a virtual crown) as a reward, similar to the unique hat design of the original.\n2. It encourages \"fanatical\" behavior by rewarding users for consistently upvoting content from a single creator, mirroring the devotion of a fan.\n3. It creates a visible symbol of user engagement and loyalty, which can drive further interaction on the platform.\n\nOptions B, C, and D, while potentially engaging, don't capture the specific \"fan\" aspect that is central to the \"Fan-hat-ic\" concept. Option B focuses on user creativity rather than fandom. Option C encourages diverse interactions rather than devoted following. Option D is about trend-spotting, which doesn't relate directly to the fan concept.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the original hat's design and purpose, application of that concept to a new context, and evaluation of different approaches to user engagement in social media platforms, thus targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/16", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/218997", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/27414/"], "docs_id": 218997, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently replaced a single AC dimmer light switch that was one of two light switches in a larger box.

I'm thinking one of two things explain why:\n\n1. The new FEIT switch was defective (which would be my 4th defective switch from the big carton of FEIT switches I bought).\n2. The naked ground wire touched the contacts of the other switch in the box.\n\nI turned off the breaker, put it a completely different switch, and did my best to get that naked ground wire as far away as possible from the other switch. Then I flipped the breaker on (shielding my eyes, and standing away from the breaker box), and everything worked.\n\nSo my question: Why are ground wires sometimes installed without any insulation? The cost of insulated wire is almost identical to that of non\\-insulated wire, so I tend to think cost is not the primary driver of this decision.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cost, mostly\n------------\n\nWhether your grounding conductors are bare, insulated, or not even a wire to begin with depends on what wiring method you are working with. NM, because it's made in large quantities, uses a bare grounding wire to save cost (likewise with UF and most SE cables, as those pennies add up at industrial scales). On the other hand, if your house is wired using armored cable (AC), there are no ground wires, because the metal cable armor serves as the ground with the aid of a thin \"bonding strip\" to prevent \"choking\" of fault currents caused by stray inductive interactions. That lack of grounding wires is also a notable feature of many installs done in metal conduit, as the *conduit itself* then becomes the grounding conductor.\n\nFurthermore, some wiring methods aren't uniform in how they handle this; it's legal (and occasionally required) to run a separate equipment grounding conductor in metal conduit, and in most (albeit not all!) cases, equipment grounding conductors inside conduits can be either bare or insulated. Likewise, metal\\-clad cable usually uses an insulated grounding conductor, but can sometimes be found with a bare grounding conductor, or in configurations where the armor is the grounding means."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about electrical wiring and grounding, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is retrofitting an older home with a mix of wiring methods. During the inspection, they notice that some circuits have bare copper ground wires, while others have no visible ground wire at all. What is the most likely explanation for this observation, and what potential safety concern should the electrician address?\n\nA) The bare copper wires are a cost-cutting measure, and the circuits without visible grounds are ungrounded and unsafe.\nB) The bare copper grounds are in NM cable, and the circuits without visible grounds likely use metal conduit for grounding.\nC) The bare copper grounds are incorrectly installed, and the circuits without visible grounds use wireless grounding technology.\nD) The bare copper grounds indicate modern wiring, while the circuits without visible grounds are outdated and need replacement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a real-world scenario. The correct answer (B) reflects the understanding that different wiring methods handle grounding differently. Bare copper ground wires are commonly used in NM (non-metallic) cable as a cost-saving measure, as mentioned in the documentation. The circuits without visible ground wires likely use metal conduit or armored cable (AC) as the grounding means, where the metal itself serves as the equipment grounding conductor.\n\nOption A is a distractor that assumes cost-cutting is the only reason for bare wires and misunderstands the grounding capabilities of metal conduit. Option C introduces an implausible \"wireless grounding\" concept to test critical thinking. Option D incorrectly associates bare grounds with modernity and assumes all invisible grounds are outdated.\n\nThe potential safety concern the electrician should address is ensuring that all circuits, regardless of wiring method, have proper and continuous grounding.

That is you are considering that you can make the error asymptotically stable with the appropriate choice of $u.$ My interpretation of your question is:\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two IO stable systems IO stable? (Where IO Stable can mean whatever type of stability you want it to mean)\n\nFor all practical purposes this is what you are asking since we can always absorb a sign into one of the system's outputs and ask that question for $e' \\= y\\_1 \\+ y\\_2\\.$ Now, this is still not obviously true. For example, Arastas' combined system is not controllable. In particular, note that the stacked system is\n\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\dot{x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\&\\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\-1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} {x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ {x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\ \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix} u, \\\\\\\\ y \\&\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the Kalman Controllability Conditions and verify a lack of controllability. However, it is stabilizable! The eigenvalues of the system matrix remain negative. In fact, this is true for any stacked systems that are otherwise **decoupled**. The eigenvalues of the combined system are necessarily the union of eigenvalues. So if you have two systems whose system matrix is Hurwitz, then the stacked state also has a Hurwitz system matrix. Moreover, if both systems are controllable, you at the minimum have stabilizability. And, of course, if all the states decay, clearly the output $y :\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2 \\\\to 0$ as well.\n\nOf course, by stacking the system, it should be made clear that the feedback used to stabilize the system *may be different* than the feedback used to stabilize the individual subsystems. As does the nature of the stability. That shouldn't be surprising. However, my interpretation of your question is that $u$ is the same in both, but not a\\-priori fixed. So under that interpretation this is reasonable.\n\nNow, what about in the nonlinear case. Clearly, even in the linear case, you are going to lose modes of controllability and so that is likely to highly constrain the nonlinear case (and being nonlinear the problem gets harder). First off, recognize that if both systems can be linearized, have Hurwitz jacobians and are controllable we can just defer to the above result. So let us consider the other cases. This is where it gets tricky. One place to look is passivity and that is not a bad place to look since you are already considering Lyapunov stability. Assuming you absorb a sign in the right place and prove that the sign flipped system is passive (i.e. you proved the map $u\\_2\\\\mapsto \\-y\\_2$ is passive) you can consider\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two passive systems, passive?\n\nAlways. Once the combined system is passive, you can stabilize it with a strictly passive feedback to get $L\\_2$ stability ($L\\_2$ inputs produce $L\\_2$ outputs).\n\nYou can also consider feedback interconnections and cleverly organize your inputs and outputs to get some input to the error is passive probably. However all of these considerations depend highly on the system you are considering as they are quite restrictive! There are a wide variety of tools available that, once you have determined a system and specific category of stability, could be leveraged."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is analyzing the stability of two nonlinear systems with stable equilibria at x\u2081 = x\u2082 = 0, described by:\n\n\u1e8b\u2081 = f(x\u2081, u)\n\u1e8b\u2082 = g(x\u2082, u)\n\nwhere u is an identical input for both systems.

This solution addresses several key considerations:\n\n1. Consistency: By setting the text margin globally, it ensures all slides maintain the same indentation without needing to adjust each \\frametitle individually.\n\n2. Theme Independence: Unlike modifying theme source code, this approach works across different themes, allowing for easy theme changes without breaking the layout.\n\n3.

It used to not subside for a month or more.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of subtle differences in meaning and usage between \"didn't\" and \"wouldn't\" in the context of describing past experiences. Both \"didn't\" and \"wouldn't\" can be grammatically correct in this sentence, but they carry slightly different connotations. \n\n\"Didn't\" emphasizes the factual nature of the past event, treating each mosquito bite as a discrete occurrence. It aligns with the statement \"That was a fact then; not any more\" from the original post.\n\n\"Wouldn't\" implies a habitual or repeated action in the past, suggesting that this was a common experience with mosquito bites during the writer's high school years. It can convey a sense of expectation or predictability about the duration of the itching.\n\nThe question challenges the test-taker to consider these nuances and recognize that both options can be valid depending on the precise meaning the writer wants to convey. This aligns with the documentation, which suggests that the difference is subtle and that both options can be considered correct.\n\nOptions A and B are distractors that represent common misconceptions about the exclusivity of one form over the other.

The correct answer is D because, as explained in the documentation, verbs related to mental states (like \"think\") often use the simple present tense even when referring to current, non-habitual situations. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ongoing physical actions typically use the present continuous (\"is throwing\"). \n\nOption B, while using simple present correctly for habitual actions, is not the best answer because this usage is more straightforward and doesn't test the more complex concept presented in the documentation. \n\nOption C is incorrect because physical states in progress typically use the present continuous (\"are you lying\").\n\nOption D correctly uses \"do you think\" to ask about an immediate thought process, which aligns with the documentation's explanation that verbs of mental state can use simple present for current situations.

The problem is that `statusBar` does not register the events of `Hooks.manageDocks` properly. Once `xmonad` is running all works well because `manageDocks` is able to update the `Struts` on every window event. But in the moment that `xmonad` is starting the event of making the first windows fullscreen happens before the events from `manageDocks`. This mages that first open window to ignore the existence of `xmobar`.\n\n`manageDocks` has its event handler that **must** be set as the last event handler, therefore `statusBar` cannot be used. Instead, it is necessary to make `xmonad` call and configure `xmobar` manually through `dynamicLog`, `manageHook`, `layoutHook` and `handleEventHook`. A minimalistic configuration for this would be:\n\n```\nmain = do\n    xmproc <- spawnPipe \"xmobar\"\n    xmonad $ defaultConfig\n      { modMask            = mod4Mask\n      , manageHook         = manageDocks <+> manageHook defaultConfig\n      , layoutHook         = avoidStruts  $ layoutHook defaultConfig\n      -- this must be in this order, docksEventHook must be last\n      , handleEventHook    = handleEventHook defaultConfig <+> docksEventHook\n      , logHook            = dynamicLogWithPP xmobarPP\n          { ppOutput          = hPutStrLn xmproc\n          , ppTitle           = xmobarColor \"darkgreen\"  \"\" . shorten 20\n          , ppHiddenNoWindows = xmobarColor \"grey\" \"\"\n          }\n      , startupHook        = setWMName \"LG3D\"\n      } `additionalKeys`\n      [ ((mod4Mask, xK_b), sendMessage ToggleStruts) ]\n\n```\n\nThis makes all events to be processed by `docsEventHook` and ensures that layout changes made by `docsEventHook` are the last ones applied. Now\n\n```\nlowerOnStart = False\n\n```\n\n(or `True`) works as expected *in all cases* within `xmobarrc`."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A developer is experiencing inconsistent behavior with xmobar in their XMonad configuration. When starting XMonad, xmobar appears but is not positioned correctly, and the first application opened covers the entire screen. The developer needs to press Mod+B twice to get xmobar to function properly. Given this scenario and the provided configuration snippets, what is the most likely cause of this issue and the best solution?\n\nA) The `lowerOnStart` and `hideOnStart` settings in .xmobarrc need to be adjusted\nB) The `statusBar` function in xmonad.hs is not properly integrating with XMonad's event handling system\nC) The `.xinitrc` file is not properly initializing XMonad and xmobar\nD) The `manageHook` in xmonad.hs is incorrectly handling window placement\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue lies in how the `statusBar` function integrates with XMonad's event handling system, specifically with regards to the `Hooks.manageDocks` functionality. The `statusBar` function does not properly register the events from `manageDocks` during XMonad's startup sequence. This causes the first window event (making the first application fullscreen) to occur before `manageDocks` can update the `Struts`, leading to the observed behavior where the first application ignores xmobar's existence.\n\nThe solution involves manually configuring XMonad to work with xmobar instead of using the `statusBar` function. This requires setting up `dynamicLog`, `manageHook`, `layoutHook`, and `handleEventHook` manually to ensure proper event handling. Crucially, the `docksEventHook` must be set as the last event handler to ensure that layout changes made by `docksEventHook` are applied last.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adjusting `lowerOnStart` and `hideOnStart` in .xmobarrc does not address the core issue of event handling in XMonad. Option C is not the primary cause, as the `.xinitrc` file is correctly starting XMonad. Option D is also incorrect, as the issue is not with window placement but with event handling and struts management.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding XMonad's event handling system, the interaction between XMonad and xmobar, and the importance of proper hook configuration.

Given the current implementation and the goal of easily adding more task types in the future, which of the following approaches would be the most effective and align with best practices in object-oriented design?\n\nA) Implement a generic type parameter <T extends Runnable> in the TaskManager class and modify the constructor to accept T\nB) Create an abstract TaskFactory class with concrete implementations for each task type, using the Factory Method pattern\nC) Modify the TaskManager to accept a List<Runnable> in its constructor, allowing multiple tasks to be managed simultaneously\nD) Implement the Command pattern, with TaskManager acting as the invoker and each task as a concrete command\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options offer improvements over the original design, option C provides the most flexible and scalable solution that aligns with the given requirements and best practices:\n\n1. It allows the TaskManager to handle multiple tasks, addressing the requirement to \"have possibility to add more task in the future\".\n2. By accepting a List<Runnable>, it leverages the common Runnable interface, eliminating the need for type casting and improving type safety.\n3. This approach is more flexible than option A, as it doesn't limit the TaskManager to a single task type.\n4. It's simpler to implement and understand compared to options B and D, which introduce more complex design patterns that may be overkill for this scenario.\n5. It allows for easy addition of new task types without modifying the TaskManager class, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.\n6. This design works well with the ThreadPoolExecutor, as you can easily submit multiple tasks to the thread pool.\n\nOption A improves type safety but doesn't address managing multiple tasks.

I am a big fan of the open\\-source concept \\- especially in research, where transparency and reproducibility is already a big part of the culture. I gladly contribute as much as I can to the community, and releasing my code for anyone to use is part of that.\n\nHowever, in research there is always a certain measure of uncertainty about what the stuff you produce will be used for. I fully understand that I can't copyright any results or conclusions \\- but I can protect how others use my code, and I would like to make sure that there is no (legal) way to incorporate software I produce in military applications.\n\nI've read through a few of the shorter ones of the common OSS licenses, and summaries of some more, but they all seem to focus solely on the questions \"do you earn money on my code?\" and \"do you make my code available with your program?\" \\- nothing about what the program actually does with the code.\n\nAre there any good open\\-source licenses that explicitly prohibit all kinds of military applications?\n\n### Update:\n\nAfter reading up some more on how OSS works, I've realized that a license that meets my needs by definition will not be open\\-source, since open\\-source licenses cannot discriminate against fields. Thus, I'm rather looking for a license that is *like* an open\\-source license, except that it prohibits military use. I want this license to be already existing, authored or at least reviewed by someone who actually knows licensing, since I don't.\n\nAlso, in response to a couple of remarks that this will be difficult to enforce: yes, I realize that. But this is more for myself than for the legal implications; if I use a license like this, and a military organization uses my code anyway, they are breaking the law and they are doing it despite my explicit instructions not to. Thus, the potentially gruesome things that they do with applications that include software I've written are no longer \"on my conciousness\", since they stole the software from me. (And somewhere I have a na\u00efve hope that if they need something I've done, and my license prohibits them from using it legally, they'll get someone elses program that does the same thing and allows them to use it. Not that governments always do, but they always *should* abide by the law...)\n\nIt's a moral safeguard, so to speak, rather than something I actually expect to bring up in court (if my mediocre code is ever used by CIA...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How would one enforce such a license?\n\nWould you prohibit *any* military use? If the software checks air pressure in tires, and someone decides to use it on a military Hummer, is that a prohibited use? Can people in the military industrial complex use it to plan their monthly picnic?\n\nWould it be an acceptable use if the software improved ballistic missile trajectories, and the improved accuracy of the weapon prevented civilians from being killed? Or would any use in a weapon be prohibited?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions you have to ask yourself, if you want to make a software license that satisfies your sensibilities.\n\nNevertheless, I'd try an keep it simple. [Yahoo's Terms of Use](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/desktopsearch/desktopsearch-300.html) state that their software must not be used \n\n> *\"to operate nuclear facilities, life support or other mission critical applications where human life or property may be at stake.\"*\n\nThat's probably as good a clause as any, if you add the word \"weapons\" to the prohibited list of uses."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher has developed a novel algorithm for optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing environments.

"answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a suitable multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is working with a complex MultiLineString geometry representing a road network. They need to find the distance between two points along this network, but using the standard Euclidean distance method (pt1.distance(pt2)) isn't giving accurate results for their use case. What approach should the engineer take to correctly calculate the distance along the MultiLineString?\n\nA) Use the length() method on a subset of the MultiLineString between the two points\nB) Calculate the sum of distances from each point to the nearest intersection point\nC) Implement a custom algorithm to traverse the MultiLineString segments\nD) Convert the MultiLineString to a LineString and then use the project() method\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question requires understanding of complex geometric operations on MultiLineString objects. The standard distance() method calculates Euclidean distance, which doesn't follow the path of the MultiLineString. Option A is incorrect because simply using length() on a subset wouldn't account for the complex structure of the MultiLineString. Option B is a simplification that wouldn't work for all cases. Option D would lose the multi-part nature of the geometry.\n\nThe correct approach (C) involves implementing a custom algorithm to traverse the MultiLineString segments. This would typically involve:\n1. Finding which LineString components contain each point\n2. Calculating distances along those LineStrings to their endpoints\n3. Summing distances along intermediate LineStrings\n4. Handling cases where points are on different disconnected parts of the MultiLineString\n\nThis solution requires deeper understanding of geometric algorithms and the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the Shapely library, meeting the criteria for a high-level analysis question."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/67022", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 67022, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know it's for the linux program patch, but if I try to use it, I get the following error:\n\nmissing header for unified diff at line 4 of patch\n\nmalformed patch at line 5: quit\n\nInstead, I'd like to just cut out the middleman and edit it by hand, but I don't know what any of the symbols mean.\n\n```\na/com.ibm.celldt.simulator.profile.default_3.1.0.200809010950/simulator_init.tcl\n\n+ b/com.ibm.celldt.simulator.profile.default_3.1.0.200809010950/simulator_init.tcl\n@@ -701,9 +701,9 @@ proc CellDT_ShutdownComplete { args } {\nquit\n}\n\n-mysim trigger set console \"The system is going down for system halt NOW!\" CellDT_ShutdownNotified\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: Switching to runlevel: 0\" CellDT_ShutdownStarted\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel\" CellDT_ShutdownComplete\n+mysim trigger set console \"init: rcS main\" CellDT_ShutdownNotified\n+mysim trigger set console \"Sending all processes the TERM signal\" CellDT_ShutdownStarted\n+mysim trigger set console \"md: stopping all md devices.\" CellDT_ShutdownComplete\n\nproc writeConsole { t } {\nmysim console create console_id in string $t\n@@ -740,8 +740,8 @@ proc CellDT_BootNearlyReady { args } {\n}\n\nmysim trigger set console \"Starting Linux\" CellDT_BootedBios\n-mysim trigger set console \"Welcome to Fedora Core\" CellDT_BootedLinux\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: Entering runlevel: 2\" CellDT_BootNearlyReady\n+mysim trigger set console \"Welcome to Fedora\" CellDT_BootedLinux\n+mysim trigger set console \"Starting login process\" CellDT_BootNearlyReady\n\n# # CONFIGURATION:\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Unified diff format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format): basically '\\-' means removed line, '\\+' means added line.

The correct answer is B because the patch introduces the most significant change by adding pre-processing and post-processing steps to the data handling.\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Addition of `adjusted_input = preprocess(input)` before calculation\n2. Use of `adjusted_input` instead of `input` in the calculation\n3. Replacement of static `threshold` with `dynamic_threshold(input)`\n4. Addition of `postprocess(result)` before returning the result\n\nOption A is incorrect because the basic structure of returning None for results not exceeding the threshold remains unchanged. Option C is incorrect because the multiplication by 2 was present in both the original and patched versions. Option D is actually the opposite of what the patch does, changing from a static to a dynamic threshold.\n\nThis question tests the ability to read and interpret patch files, understand code flow changes, and identify the most impactful modifications in terms of overall function behavior.

If they do not match, they are not allowed into the game.\n\nThis effectively means that if someone wants to join the server as you, they'll also need access to your Microsoft/Mojang account. You should be more worried if you are hacked on an online server than an offline one.\n\nIf you do not have an internet connection, no players will be able to join in online mode.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason to disable it, don't, as it also enables the usage of player skins, and since you are running an SMP, you cannot change your mind easily \\- all inventories and other player data will be lost.\n\nIf you are running a public server, definitely don't.\n\nOffline Mode\n------------\n\nOffline mode does not make a difference in terms of performance, and definitely not a negative one. It actually shaves a few seconds off the login time, but still doesn't effect the overall performance, as this is handled separately.\n\nOffline mode simply disables authentication, meaning that the server does not know if I player is who they say they are.\n\nIn offline mode, any player joining the game is allowed in with whatever name they please. If there is a whitelist, it will still work, but a player can bypass it by changing their name.\n\nHowever, offline mode does have its advantages. If you do not have access to the internet, you can still continue to play on your locally hosted server. If you are messing around with Bukkit plugins while in a car ([but not if you're driving it](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Splash)), or in space (as you often do) this may be useful. Of course, you can use a Wi\\-Fi Hotspot on your phone (unless in space), or just use a single\\-player world.\n\nOffline mode is also useful if you want to be able to use any username. For example, if you are working on a multiplayer Minecraft minigame, it can be useful to test it with multiple players, without buying another account. It can also be used if your friend does not own a Minecraft account, and they want to try the game before buying it. \\*\n\n\\* I'm not encouraging piracy.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Security: Offline mode is less secure as it bypasses authentication, making it unsuitable for public servers (eliminating option A) or servers where account verification is important (eliminating option D).\n\n2. Performance: The documentation states that offline mode doesn't negatively impact performance and can actually slightly improve login times, so performance isn't a deciding factor here.\n\n3. Functionality: Offline mode allows the use of any username without needing multiple accounts, which is ideal for testing scenarios with multiple players.\n\n4. Real-world application: For plugin and minigame development, being able to simulate multiple players quickly is valuable, making offline mode appropriate in this context.\n\n5. Internet connectivity: While offline mode can work without internet, option C is not the best choice because an SMP server typically requires consistent connectivity for multiple players.\n\n6.

This approach directly addresses the root cause of the problem without introducing new complications or requiring extensive modifications to the presentation structure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding \\usepackage{enumitem} to the document preamble would likely exacerbate the issue, as the package is already causing the problem.\n\nOption B could potentially work but would require more extensive modifications to the theme file and might introduce unintended side effects or compatibility issues with other aspects of the Presento theme.\n\nOption D is a workaround that doesn't address the underlying issue and would require significant effort to implement throughout the presentation, potentially leading to inconsistencies or maintenance difficulties.\n\nBy choosing to remove the incompatible package from the theme file (Option C), the developer can resolve the bullet point issue while maintaining the overall design and functionality of the Presento theme, allowing Beamer's native itemize environment to function as intended."}, "65": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/20", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/319710", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/78454/"], "docs_id": 319710, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Inspite of googling to the best of my ability, unfortunately I am unable to find reasons why lightgbm is fast. The lightgbm documentation explains that the strategy followed is 'Leaf\\-wise (Best\\-first) Tree Growth' as against 'Level wise Tree Growth'. I am unable to understand the difference. In so far as I understand, in a decision tree, at every node, before splitting, information gain that would result from each candidate feature is calculated and that feature is selected for the split at that node which will provide maximum information gain at that node. In this [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lightgbm.pdf) on lightgbm, (Guolin Ke \\& others) mention about Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS). Unfortunately I am unable to understand this also.\nI am familiar with the concept of information gain in measuring impurity but unable to understand what role gradient plays in it and also what is meant by gradient of a data\\-point. Is it possible to help in layman's language.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since a more detailed explanation was asked: \nThere are three reasons why LightGBM is fast:\n\n* Histogram based splitting\n* Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS)\n* Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)\n\n**Histogram based splitting** is in the literature since the late 1990's, but it became popular with Xgboost, that was the first publicly available package to implement it. Since finding the exact optimal split is very costly when there's a lot of data (since it involves testing every possible split point), using a quantile (or histogram) based approximate solution can make the splitting procedure much faster, without losing too much accuracy. This involves computing some optimal weighted quantiles of your feature (i.e. group data into bins), and chose the split points between these quantiles. The algorithm for this procedure can be found in [Xgboost's paper.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf) Xgboost proposed local and global histograms, meaning that they would be computed for every feature either at the beginning of the algorithm (global) or at every new split (local). LightGBM briefly says that it bases its work on histogram based splitting (there are many papers on this), but it does not clarify the way the histogram are computed nor how this is implemented together with GOSS. \n**Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS)** is an exclusive feature of LightGBM, and it's some sort of advanced subsampling of the data. Since the computational time for split finding is proportional to the number of features and instances, subsampling the instances makes this problem faster, and this is also the idea behind [Stochastic Gradient Boosting](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf) by Friedman. However, SGB samples the data randomly, often causing a decrease in accuracy of the model. What GOSS does instead is something similar to Adaboost \\- records are weighted by their pseudo\\-residuals \\- since instances with low residuals have little impact on the training as they are already well\\-trained. Therefore, high\\-residuals records are kept while low\\-residuals ones are heavily subsampled, and their weights are recalibrated in order to avoid inserting a bias in the distribution of the residuals. This greatly reduces the number of instances, while maintaining an extremely good performance, and it is one of the reasons why the algorithm is performing better than other histogram based packages such as H2O or XGboost. \n**Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)** is used to deal with sparse features. I will not get into the details at all, mostly because I am not particularly familiar with them; however, suffice to say that EFB is used to bundle sparse features together (features that are never non\\-zero together), in a way that greatly reduces computational effort on big sparse datasets (as mentioned, finding splits is also proportional to the total number of features). The optimal bundling of the sparse features is usually an NP\\-hard problem, but it is solved with good approximation through a greedy algorithm.\n\nIn their documentation they also mention the leaf\\-growth first of the trees. This is not mentioned, as far as I know, in the paper, but it's supposed to be used to increase accuracy and not speed.\n\nSource: [LightGBM paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf) :)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about LightGBM, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is comparing LightGBM to traditional gradient boosting algorithms for a large-scale machine learning project. Which combination of LightGBM's features would most effectively address the challenge of maintaining model accuracy while significantly reducing training time on a dataset with many sparse features and a large number of instances?\n\nA) Histogram-based splitting and Leaf-wise tree growth\nB) Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Level-wise tree growth\nC) Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting\nD) Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing the strengths of LightGBM and applying them to a specific scenario. The correct answer is D because it combines two of LightGBM's most powerful features for speed and efficiency:\n\n1. Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) addresses the challenge of a large number of instances. GOSS intelligently subsamples the data by keeping instances with high gradients (which contribute more to the training) and downsampling instances with low gradients. This significantly reduces the number of instances to process without sacrificing much accuracy, unlike random sampling methods.\n\n2. Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) is specifically designed to handle sparse features efficiently. By bundling mutually exclusive sparse features together, it effectively reduces the number of features the algorithm needs to process, which is particularly beneficial for datasets with many sparse features.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while histogram-based splitting is a speed improvement, it doesn't specifically address the challenges mentioned in the question. Leaf-wise tree growth is mainly for improving accuracy, not speed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because level-wise tree growth is not a feature of LightGBM and doesn't offer the speed advantages of leaf-wise growth.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Stochastic Gradient Boosting is a different technique that involves random sampling, which doesn't offer the same benefits as GOSS in maintaining accuracy. Additionally, while EFB is correct for handling sparse features, this option doesn't address the large number of instances as effectively as GOSS.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically evaluate which combination of features would be most effective for the given problem."}, "66": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/17", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/115766", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/55937/"], "docs_id": 115766, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to find how to compute the true negative (TN), false negative (FN), true positive (TP), and false positive (FP) if I have a cutpoint like in the following picture: \n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/k8Pd0.jpg)\n\n```\nlibrary(Epi)\ndane = read.table(\"dane.txt\", header=TRUE, sep=\";\")       \nROC(form = stan~palenie, plot=\"ROC\", data=dane)\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Presumably by 'restricted range' you mean that there's both an upper and lower bound to the possible values the data can take.\n\nSeveral of the distributions are reasonably consistent with the general shape of your data, but since your data are (i) discrete and (ii) bounded above, your data cannot actually come from any of those distributions.\n\nAs a way of choosing a distributional model, this activity strikes me as potentially a form of data dredging.\n\n---\n\nNote that if you're looking to use regression, then your immediate assumption is that you have not one distribution, but a different distribution (at least in respect of location) at each set of $x$ values.\n\nAs such, looking at the marginal distribution of $y$ (in terms of trying to identify a single distribution to describe it) is of little use \\- it doesn't relate to the regression assumptions, which involve the conditional distribution, not the marginal.\n\nEven when the conditional distributions are not normal, you may still be able to use least squares \\- most forms of inference will still be okay in large samples, and even in small samples it may be okay as long as you adapt any inferential procedures.

The 'ROC' function from the 'Epi' package, as shown in the provided code snippet, allows for the calculation of the ROC curve, which inherently involves evaluating the model's performance at various cutpoints. By applying this function and extracting the confusion matrix components (TN, FN, TP, FP) for each cutpoint, the data scientist can comprehensively assess the model's performance across different decision thresholds.\n\nThis approach is superior because:\n1. It leverages the existing 'ROC' function, which is designed for this type of analysis.\n2.

This approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. It provides clean, professional formatting by using the booktabs package, which is known for creating high-quality tables in LaTeX.\n2. The \\multirow command allows for proper vertical alignment of elements that span multiple rows, solving the alignment issues mentioned in the original question.\n3.

If you want longer edges you have to add intermediate points that fall in the places you'd expect.\n\nBut remember, you aren't going to get \"straight lines\" out of this, you're going to get great circles.\n\nIf you want a straight line solution, work in geometry, and recognize that you're going to have to put in your own logic to handle dateline splitting.\n\n(Dateline splitting is not hard to do, *if* your input box is not defined as \"two points\" but rather as a \"lower left point\" and \"upper right point\". Then you can easily test for cases in which the \"lower left\" point appears to be to the right of the \"upper right point\" and say \"aha! this is actually a dateline crossing case!\" and construct two query polygons with the dateline as the bounding edge.)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A GIS developer is working on a global navigation application that needs to calculate the shortest path between two distant points on Earth. The developer initially implements the spherical law of cosines formula but notices unexpected results when plotting routes across long distances. What is the most likely cause of these unexpected results, and what solution should the developer consider?\n\nA) The formula doesn't account for the Earth's ellipsoidal shape; switch to the Vincenty formula for more accurate results.\nB) The calculation is producing straight lines on a Mercator projection; implement great circle calculations instead.\nC) The formula fails to handle the International Date Line; add logic for dateline splitting in the calculations.\nD) The spherical law of cosines formula has a maximum distance limitation; use a different formula for distances over 180 degrees.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key issue here stems from a misunderstanding of how geographic calculations work on a spherical Earth versus flat map projections. The spherical law of cosines formula actually calculates great circle distances, which are the shortest paths between two points on a sphere. However, the developer's expectation of \"straight lines\" parallel to the edges of a Mercator map reveals a common misconception.\n\nThe correct solution is to implement great circle calculations, which the spherical law of cosines already provides. The unexpected results are likely due to the developer plotting these great circle routes on a flat map projection, where they appear curved.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Earth's ellipsoidal shape can affect accuracy, it's not the primary cause of the described issue. Option C touches on a real concern with dateline splitting, but this is a separate issue from the main problem of misunderstanding great circle routes. Option D is misleading; while the shortest great circle route is always less than 180 degrees, this isn't a limitation of the formula itself.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (great circle distances, map projections, and geographic calculations), applies them to a real-world scenario (global navigation app development), and tests critical thinking about the nature of geographic calculations on a spherical Earth versus flat map representations."}, "74": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/07", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/130438", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/16423/"], "docs_id": 130438, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In software development, one often has multiple individual files that are referenced or \"included\" by others.

I am wondering if conservation of energy holds beyond that special case; it seems that it should. After all, if a property holds only under special cases then the property is not a law.\n\nReading Feynman's lecture 14 volume I, I understand that if only conservative forces act on an object its total energy remains unchanged. For example, a falling object subject only to gravity has a constant sum of kinetic and potential energies. However, the system consisting of just this object is *not* an isolated system because it is subject to the external force of gravity. It seems this is an instance of conservation of energy holding outside the special case of an isolated system.\n\nFeynman argues that at the fundamental level all forces are in fact conservative. This implies that at the fundamental level conservation of energy applies to all systems. Is this true? If so, why is conservation of energy continually stated under the special case of an isolated system?\n\n(this site's \"energy\\-conservation\" tag says \"the amount of energy in a system is constant\" implying the system need not be isolated, further confusing me)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are different ways of stating conservation of energy and accounting for energy, which can make the issue confusing. One such statement is \"the total energy of an isolated system is constant\". This is true, and is the simplest way to state conservation of energy. This form of conservation of energy is the earliest taught.\n\nThere's another way of stating conservation of energy, \"the energy in a region changes by the amount of energy flowing into or out of a region, and energy in adjacent regions changes by the same amount\". You could call this local conservation of energy, and is a much stronger statement. It not only tells us that energy is conserved, but it also tells us that energy can't disappear from a region and reappear far away. This is the kind of conservation of energy that Feynman is considering, so he can apply it to systems that aren't isolated."}, "answer": "Certainly!

Alternatively cache the data before filtering and then filter the cached results. This is more appropriate if you have lots of filter parameters with significant variance as you will only have to cache 1 large result rather than thousands of smaller results. \n\nYou can get more advanced and specify cache period e.g. Cache for 10 minutes"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is implementing a search feature in a web application using the Post-Redirect-Get pattern and wants to optimize database queries for repeated searches.

This solution directly addresses the performance concern without requiring significant changes to the existing architecture.\n\nOption A (client-side caching) would require additional JavaScript implementation and wouldn't solve the issue of repeated database queries on the server side. \n\nOption C (implementing IsSameSearch) is close to what the user initially proposed, but it would require more complex logic to compare all search parameters and doesn't provide as much flexibility as caching at the database level.\n\nOption D (caching the entire dataset) could work for small datasets but would likely be memory-intensive and less efficient for large datasets with many filter combinations.\n\nThe FromCache() method, as mentioned in the top answer, allows for easy implementation of caching at the database query level. It automatically handles caching based on the query parameters, eliminating the need for manual comparison of search criteria. This approach also fits well with the Post-Redirect-Get pattern the developer wants to use, as it optimizes the \"Get\" part of the process without requiring changes to the overall flow.\n\nAdditionally, this solution provides flexibility in terms of cache duration and can be easily applied to existing queries, making it a pragmatic choice that addresses the performance concern without overhauling the entire search implementation."}, "81": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/07/01", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/323768", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/235579/"], "docs_id": 323768, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is ALMOST a direct duplicate of ([What is the netiquette for forking other people's open source projects?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/193496/what-is-the-netiquette-for-forking-other-peoples-open-source-projects/193500#193500?newreg=1b04c02763c84581bbf20a3ab7ec35e0)) except that I could not find my answer there, and I cannot comment (because I don't have enough reputation yet).\n\n**Here's my scenario:**  \n\nI have a public fork of a public GitHub project (<https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper>).

When does the singularity start to exist and why?\n\nThe matter below the event horizon still continues to collapse towards the centre (e.g. in the reference frame of the falling matter). What are the necessary conditions for the singularity to appear?\n\nI have found two similar questions but the answers did not really explain this problem to me:\n\n* [Do all black holes have a singularity?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/24934/26445)\n* [Event horizons without singularities](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/28834/26445)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you're not up to speed with general relativity this is going to be hard to explain, but I'll give it a go. The more determined reader may want to look at [this PDF (just under 1MB in size)](http://www.aei.mpg.de/~rezzolla/lnotes/mondragone/collapse.pdf) that describes the collapse in a rigorous way.\n\nA couple of points to make before we start: you're being vague about the distinction between the [singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity) and the [event horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon). The singularity is the point at the centre of the black hole where the curvature becomes infinite. The event horizon is the spherical surface that marks the radial distance below which light cannot escape. As you'll see, these form at different times.\n\nThe other point is that to make the calculation possible at all we have to use a simplified model. Specifically we assume the collapsing body is homogeneous (actually I see you anticipated that in your answer) and is made up of *dust*. In general relativity the term *[dust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_solution)* has a specific meaning \\- it means matter that is non\\-interacting (apart from gravity) and has zero pressure. This is obviously very different from the plasma found in real stars.\n\nWith the above simplifications the collapse is described by the [Oppenheimer\\-Snyder model](http://grwiki.physics.ncsu.edu/wiki/Oppenheimer-Snyder_Collapse), and it turns out that the size of the collapsing object is described by the same equation that describes the collapse of a closed universe. This equation is called the [FLRW metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric), and it gives a function called the [scale factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor_(cosmology)), $a(t)$, that describes the size of the ball of dust. For a closed universe the scale factor looks something like:\n\n![Scale factor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QreUD.gif)\n\n(image from [this PDF](http://nicadd.niu.edu/~bterzic/PHYS652/PHYS652_notes.pdf))\n\nA closed universe starts with a Big Bang, expands to a maximum size then recollapses in a [Big Crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch). It's the recollapse, i.e. the right hand side of the graph above, that describes the collapse of the ball of dust.\n\nThe radius of the ball is proportional to $a(t)$, so the radius falls in the same way as $a(t)$ does, and the singularity forms when $a(t) \\= 0$ i.e. when all the matter in the ball has collapsed to zero size.\n\nAs always in GR, we need to be very careful to define what we mean by time. In the graph above the time plotted on the horizontal axis is comoving or proper time. This is the time measured by an observer inside the ball and stationary with respect to the grains of dust around them. It is not the same as the time measured by an observer outside the ball, as we'll see in a bit.\n\nFinally, we should note that the singularity forms at the same time for every comoving observer inside the ball of dust. This is because the ball shrinks in a homogeneous way so the density is the same everywhere inside the ball. The singularity forms when the density rises to infinity (i.e. the ball radius goes to zero), and this happens everywhere inside the ball at the same time.\n\nOK, that describes the formation of the singularity, but what about the event horizon. To find the event horizon we look at the behaviour of outgoing light rays as a function of distance from the centre of the ball. The details are somewhat technical, but when we find a radius inside which the light can't escape that's the position of the event horizon. The details are described in the paper by [Luciano Rezzolla that I linked above](http://www.aei.mpg.de/~rezzolla/lnotes/mondragone/collapse.pdf), and glossing over the gory details the result is:\n\n![Horizon formation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OpOR.gif)\n\nThis shows time on the vertical axis (Once again this is comoving/proper time as discussed above) and the radius of the ball of dust on the horizontal axis. So as time passes we move upwards on the graph and the radius decreases.\n\nIt's obviously harder for light to escape from the centre of the ball than from the surface, so the event horizon forms initially at the centre of the ball then it expands outwards and reaches the surface when the radius of the ball has decreased to:\n\n$$ r \\= \\\\frac{2GM}{c^2} $$\n\nThis distance is called the [Schwarzschild radius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) and it's the event horizon radius for a stationary black hole of mass $M$. So at this moment the ball of dust now looks like a black hole and we can no longer see what's inside it.\n\nHowever note that when the event horizon reaches the Schwarzschild radius the collapse hasn't finished and the singularity hasn't formed. It takes a bit longer for the ball to finish contracting and the singularity to form. The singularity only forms when the red line meets the vertical axis.\n\nFinally, one last note on time.\n\nThroughtout all the above the time I've used is proper time, $\\\\tau$, but you and I watching the collapse from outside measure Schwarzschild coordinate time, $t$, and the two are not the same. In particular our time $t$ goes to infinity as the ball radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius $r \\= 2GM/c^2$. For us the part of the diagram above this point simply doesn't exist because it lies at times greater than infinity. So we never actually see the event horizon form. I won't go into this any further here because it's been discussed to death in previous questions on this site. However you might be interested to note this is one of the reasons for Stephen Hawking's claim that [event horizons never form](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/95366/why-does-stephen-hawking-say-black-holes-dont-exist)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about black hole formation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An advanced civilization is observing the collapse of a homogeneous dust star from a safe distance. They want to determine the precise moment when the singularity forms inside the newly created black hole. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the formation of the singularity and the challenges in observing it?\n\nA) The singularity forms simultaneously with the event horizon, but external observers can never directly detect either due to time dilation effects.\n\nB) The singularity forms before the event horizon, allowing the observers to detect it briefly before it's obscured.\n\nC) The singularity forms after the event horizon, but external observers can never see its formation as it occurs beyond their observable time.\n\nD) The singularity and event horizon form at different proper times inside the collapsing star, but at the same Schwarzschild coordinate time for external observers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests critical thinking about the nature of black hole formation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that the event horizon forms before the singularity. The event horizon starts at the center and expands outward, reaching the surface of the collapsing star when its radius equals the Schwarzschild radius (2GM/c\u00b2).\n\n2. The singularity only forms when the scale factor a(t) reaches zero, which occurs after the event horizon has already formed.\n\n3. For external observers using Schwarzschild coordinate time, time appears to slow down and \"freeze\" as the collapsing star approaches the event horizon radius. The documentation states: \"our time t goes to infinity as the ball radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius.\"\n\n4. This means that for external observers, the formation of the event horizon itself appears to take an infinite amount of time, and anything occurring after that (including the formation of the singularity) is beyond their observable time frame.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the singularity does not form simultaneously with the event horizon. Option B is incorrect because the singularity forms after, not before, the event horizon.

Which of the following scenarios best explains the root cause and solution to this problem?\n\nA) The Database Node plugin is incompatible between NetBeans versions, requiring a manual update of the plugin in 6.9.1\nB) NetBeans 6.9.1 has a known bug with Database Node functionality, necessitating a rollback to version 6.8\nC) JDK 7 update 1 is causing conflicts with NetBeans 6.9.1, resolved by reinstalling with JDK 6\nD) The developer's database drivers are outdated, requiring an update to be compatible with NetBeans 6.9.1\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex software environment issue and identify the root cause.

However, they are both useful.\n\nIf the base is being substantially current fed, so from a high impedance, then the \u03b2 model is most useful. If we are substantially controlling the base voltage, so driving it with a low impedance, then the diode equation can be easier to use.\n\nWhen we design transistor amplifiers, we need to be able to tolerate the large changes in temperature and \u03b2 that would otherwise upset the bias conditions, so these approximations are quite good enough to tell us whether we have a workable design. Any precision work needs feedback, and that's a different set of equations.\n\nWhen I design a transistor amplifier, I tend to choose the working collector current of each stage, then work backwards with the \u03b2 formula to what base current (to what **range** of base currents) that would require, and then see how much voltage drop is caused in my proposed biassing network or feedback divider by that current. If it's too high, or too variable, then I can reduce the bias impedances, or choose a higher \u03b2 transistor configuration, or otherwise iterate the design to tolerate the range.\n\nI don't find a need to use the base voltage formula. It's not predictive enough to use for setting up bias conditions. When I need to know the response of a transistor to base voltage variations, I use a gm model (basically the differential of that), or better still, S\\-parameters."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about transistor models, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a low-noise amplifier for a sensitive audio application using an NPN transistor.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The question specifies a low-noise, sensitive audio application, which requires precise control and accurate modeling of the transistor behavior.\n\n2. The documentation states that neither the \u03b2 model (Ic = B*Ib) nor the simple diode equation are entirely accurate, as they ignore collector voltage dependence and temperature sensitivity.\n\n3. For precision work, the answer mentions that feedback is needed, and \"that's a different set of equations.\"\n\n4. The documentation specifically states: \"When I need to know the response of a transistor to base voltage variations, I use a gm model (basically the differential of that), or better still, S-parameters.\"\n\n5. S-parameters provide a more comprehensive and accurate model of transistor behavior, accounting for various factors including frequency dependence, which is crucial for audio applications.\n\n6. This approach allows for more precise control over the amplifier's characteristics across different operating conditions, including temperature variations.\n\nOptions A and B are less suitable because they rely on simplified models that the documentation explicitly states are not accurate enough for precision work.

The red LED requires 20-24V, while the green and blue LEDs require 30-36V. What is the most effective approach to simultaneously operate all three LEDs while ensuring proper current regulation and color control?\n\nA) Use a single 36V power supply with individual linear regulators for each LED\nB) Implement a PWM-controlled buck converter for the red LED and direct connection for green and blue\nC) Utilize a single 36V supply with separate high-frequency switching regulators for each LED\nD) Connect all LEDs in series with a 36V supply and use current-limiting resistors for each color\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is to use a single 36V power supply with separate high-frequency switching regulators for each LED. This solution addresses several key challenges:\n\n1. Voltage differences: The separate switching regulators allow each LED to receive its optimal voltage, despite the different requirements (20-24V for red, 30-36V for green and blue).\n\n2. Current regulation: As described in the answer, each switching regulator can precisely control the current through its respective LED, which is crucial for maintaining consistent brightness and color balance.\n\n3. PWM control: The high-frequency switching (suggested at 1 MHz or more) allows for fine control over LED brightness through PWM, enabling smooth dimming and color mixing.\n\n4. Efficiency: Switching regulators are more efficient than linear regulators, especially when there's a significant voltage drop involved (as would be the case for the red LED if using a linear regulator from 36V).\n\n5. Thermal management: The higher efficiency of switching regulators results in less heat generation, which is important for high-power LEDs.\n\n6. Simultaneous operation: This approach allows all LEDs to operate simultaneously without interfering with each other, as each has its own regulated current path.\n\nOption A is incorrect because linear regulators would be inefficient and generate excessive heat, especially for the red LED. Option B doesn't provide proper current regulation for the green and blue LEDs. Option D would not allow individual control of each LED and would be inefficient due to the use of resistors for current limiting at high power levels.\n\nThe proposed solution with separate switching regulators for each LED, as illustrated in the circuit diagram, provides the best combination of performance, efficiency, and control for this challenging RGB LED configuration."}, "86": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/10", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/322353", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/199645/"], "docs_id": 322353, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Just bought a new computer and assembled it today.

Of course, not supported and you should have a backup, so simulate it first with small files on your old pool to see if everything works as expected.\n\n---\n\nFor details see [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993.html) and [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023.html) for details. You can also search online for \"create raidz2 degraded\" if you have other systems like FreeNAS etc.\n\nThe important steps (taken from the mailing list archive thread by Tomas \u00d6gren and Daniel Rock) are:\n\n1. Create sparse file with the size of the real disk (let's assume it is 1000 GB in this example):\n\n```\nmkfile -n 1000g /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n2. Create a zpool with the real disks and the sparse file:\n\n```\nzpool create -f newpool raidz2 disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4 disk5 /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n3. Immediately put the sparse files offline so that nobody tries to write on it:\n\n```\nzpool offline newpool /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n4. Your pool will now be degraded, but functioning. Copy your files to the new pool (use `ssh` or `netcat` between `send` and `recv` if using network instead of directly attached pools):\n\n```\nzfs snapshot -r oldpool@now\nzfs send -R oldpool@now | zfs recv -Fdu newpool\n\n```\n5. Destroy the old one and replace the sparse files with the now freed up disks:\n\n```\nzpool replace newpool /tmp/fakedisk1 disk6\n\n```\n\n---\n\nAgain, a word of caution depending on your redundancy level (if you use two fake disks on a Z2 or three fake disks on a Z3\\):\n\n> Remember: during data migration your are running without safety belts. \n>  If a disk fails during migration you will lose data."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is attempting to install Fedora 24 on a new high-performance computer with an ASUS motherboard, Intel i7 processor, and NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics card.

Given this scenario and the troubleshooting steps already taken, what is the most likely cause of the installation failure and the best approach to resolve it?\n\nA) UEFI compatibility issue - Disable Secure Boot in BIOS and attempt installation in Legacy mode\nB) Graphics driver conflict - Use a text-based installer and manually configure display drivers post-installation\nC) USB media corruption - Recreate the bootable USB using a different tool on another operating system\nD) RAM instability - Run memtest86+ to check for memory errors and adjust BIOS settings if necessary\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The scenario presents a complex problem involving hardware compatibility and driver issues. The most likely cause is a graphics driver conflict, given that:\n\n1. The system reaches the GRUB menu and partially boots, indicating that the basic hardware initialization and UEFI/BIOS settings are likely not the primary issue.\n2. The mouse cursor briefly appears, suggesting that the system is attempting to load a graphical environment but fails.\n3. Other distributions like Ubuntu boot fine, ruling out fundamental hardware incompatibility or USB media issues.\n4. The problem persists across multiple versions of Fedora and different USB creation methods, suggesting it's not a media or version-specific problem.\n\nThe best approach is to use a text-based installer, which bypasses the problematic graphical environment.

Given the following information from their Eclipse configuration and error logs, what is the most effective long-term solution to address this issue?\n\nA) Increase the -Xmx value in eclipse.ini to allocate more heap memory\nB) Switch to an older version of the JDK, such as Java 5\nC) Modify eclipse.ini to include -XX:MaxPermSize=256m and increase PermGen space\nD) Uninstall m2eclipse plugin to reduce memory consumption\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue is insufficient PermGen space, as evidenced by the repeated \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\" errors in the logs. While increasing heap memory (-Xmx) might help temporarily, it doesn't address the specific PermGen issue. Switching to an older JDK or removing m2eclipse are not appropriate solutions and may introduce new problems or limit functionality.\n\nThe most effective long-term solution is to increase the PermGen space by adding \"-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\" to the eclipse.ini file. This directly addresses the PermGen space limitation causing the errors. The documentation mentions that for Helios and the user's Java version, using \"-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\" is the correct approach due to a bug with the alternative \"launcher.XXMaxPermSize\" argument.\n\nThis solution requires understanding of Java memory management, Eclipse configuration, and the ability to interpret error logs to identify the root cause.

They notice that the model's residuals exhibit significant autocorrelation, and the volatility forecast seems to underestimate large price movements. Which of the following modifications to the model would most likely address both of these issues simultaneously?\n\nA) Increase the order of the GARCH term (p) in the volatility equation\nB) Implement an EGARCH model to account for leverage effects\nC) Add more AR terms to the mean equation for y_t\nD) Switch to an AR(q)-GARCH(p,q) model with carefully selected q for both components\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D for the following reasons:\n\n1. The autocorrelation in residuals suggests that the mean equation is not adequately capturing the time series dynamics. Adding AR terms to y_t (as shown in the Wikipedia equation) can help address this issue.\n\n2. The underestimation of large price movements indicates that the volatility model might need improvement. While increasing the GARCH order (option A) might help, it doesn't address the mean equation issue.\n\n3. The EGARCH model (option B) could potentially help with asymmetric volatility responses but doesn't directly address the autocorrelation in the mean equation.\n\n4. Option C only addresses the mean equation and not the volatility modeling issue.\n\n5. Option D, implementing an AR(q)-GARCH(p,q) model, addresses both the mean equation (by adding AR terms to capture autocorrelation) and the volatility equation. This combined approach is most likely to simultaneously resolve both issues.\n\nThe question tests the candidate's ability to:\n- Understand the components of a GARCH model (mean and volatility equations)\n- Recognize the implications of model diagnostic issues (autocorrelation, underestimation of large movements)\n- Apply knowledge of advanced GARCH variants to a practical problem\n- Integrate concepts from different parts of the documentation (AR process for y_t and GARCH process for volatility)\n\nThis question targets higher cognitive levels by requiring analysis of a complex scenario and application of theoretical knowledge to solve a practical problem in financial modeling."}, "90": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/22", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/279252", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/73525/"], "docs_id": 279252, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: i followed this answer\n\n<https://magento.stackexchange.com/a/258463/73525> \n\nstep 1: \n\n`{{block class=\"Magento\\CatalogSearch\\Block\\Advanced\\Form\" template=\"Magento_CatalogSearch::advanced/form.phtml\"}}` \n\ni did it's showing in home page (advanced search)\n\nbut\nstep 2:\n\nIf you need to customize phtml, copy it from:\n\n```\nvendor/magento/module-catalog-search/view/frontend/templates/advanced/form.phtml\n\n```\n\n**where i can copy to \nmy default theme in magento** \n\nin my folders\n\n> app/design/Magento after this no folder available\n\nhow i can do step 2\n\n(i'm using magento luma theme)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Add Following Code in default.xml layout of theme\n\n```\n<referenceBlock name=\"footer_links\">\n  <block class=\"Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Html\\Link\\Current\" name=\"custom-footer-link\">\n    <arguments>\n      <argument name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\">[Add Label]</argument>\n      <argument name=\"path\" xsi:type=\"string\">[Add Link]</argument>\n     </arguments>\n  </block>\n</referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nyou can add `default.xml` in `app/design/Magento/luma/Magento_Theme/layout/`"}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Magento developer is customizing the advanced search functionality for a client's e-commerce site using the Luma theme.

The correct approach (D) involves creating a theme-specific override for the template file, which allows for customization while maintaining the ability to upgrade Magento core files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it places the file directly in the Luma theme, which is not recommended as it modifies a core theme.\nOption B is not the best approach as it involves modifying block classes, which is more complex and less flexible than template overrides for this scenario.\nOption C is overkill for template customization and doesn't follow the theme inheritance principle.\n\nThe correct path (app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/Magento_CatalogSearch/templates/advanced/form.phtml) respects Magento's theme hierarchy, allowing for proper fallback to the parent theme or Magento core files.

Given the installation method and configuration attempt described, what is the most likely cause of this issue and the appropriate solution?\n\nA) The stream module was not compiled with Nginx and needs to be manually compiled and installed as a separate step.\nB) The stream module is present but configured as a dynamic module, requiring it to be explicitly loaded in the nginx.conf file.\nC) The PPA repository used for installation doesn't include the stream module, necessitating a switch to the official Nginx repository.\nD) The stream directive is placed in the wrong context within the nginx.conf file and needs to be moved to the http block.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how Nginx modules are compiled and loaded. In the provided nginx -V output, we can see the configure argument \"--with-stream=dynamic\". This indicates that the stream module is indeed present, but it's compiled as a dynamic module rather than being statically linked.\n\nDynamic modules in Nginx need to be explicitly loaded in the configuration file before they can be used. The error message \"unknown directive 'stream'\" suggests that the module hasn't been loaded, not that it's missing entirely.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the module is already compiled, just as a dynamic module. Option C is wrong because the module is present in the installed version, as evidenced by the configure arguments. Option D misunderstands the nature of the stream module, which is separate from the http module and wouldn't be placed within an http block.\n\nThe correct solution, as indicated by option B, is to load the dynamic module explicitly. This can be done by adding the following line at the top of the nginx.conf file:\n\n```\nload_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\n```\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts, including understanding Nginx module compilation options, the difference between static and dynamic modules, and how to properly configure Nginx to use dynamic modules.

Hydrocolloid binders (e.g., xanthan gum, carrageenan) can significantly improve the structural integrity of baked goods by forming a gel-like network that holds ingredients together. This directly addresses the \"crumbling\" issue mentioned in the documentation.\n\n2. Adjusting particle size distribution of dry ingredients (making them finer and more uniform) can improve cohesion between particles, reducing the likelihood of loose crumbs forming. This relates to the observation of \"tiny particles\" in the original context.\n\nOption A might increase gluten development, potentially making the cookie tougher rather than reducing crumbs.

Which of the following actions is most likely to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the importance sampling estimation?\n\nA) Increase the number of iterations to 100,000 without changing the sampling distribution\nB) Modify the importance sampling distribution to better match the shape of the integrand\nC) Switch to a simple Monte Carlo method using uniform sampling\nD) Decrease the number of iterations but use a higher-order numerical integration method\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key to efficient importance sampling lies in choosing an appropriate sampling distribution g(x) that closely resembles the shape of the integrand f(x). In this scenario, the fact that the relative error is not decreasing as expected suggests that the current importance sampling distribution may not be well-suited to the problem.\n\nOption A (increasing iterations) would only marginally improve results if the sampling distribution is poorly chosen, as it doesn't address the root cause of inefficiency.\n\nOption B directly addresses the core issue by modifying the importance sampling distribution. A well-chosen g(x) can significantly reduce the variance of the estimator, leading to faster convergence and lower relative error.\n\nOption C (switching to simple Monte Carlo) would likely be less efficient than a well-implemented importance sampling method, especially for complex or highly peaked integrands.\n\nOption D (decreasing iterations with higher-order methods) doesn't align with the Monte Carlo approach and wouldn't necessarily improve the estimation for a poorly chosen sampling distribution.\n\nBy choosing B, the engineer tackles the fundamental challenge in importance sampling: finding a sampling distribution that minimizes the variance of the estimator. This requires analysis of the integrand's behavior and potentially iterative refinement of g(x), but it's the most effective way to improve the method's efficiency and accuracy."}, "95": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/16", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/332220", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/147914/"], "docs_id": 332220, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Fairly new to ArcMap 10\\.3, I'm trying to find a method to build a toolbox model to determine the area of flooding within a basin.

The correct answer (C) is the most effective and reliable approach because:\n\n1. Intersect (flooding with basin) ensures that only flooding within the basin is considered, avoiding double-counting.\n2. Erase (result with ponds) is functionally equivalent to the Union + Select method mentioned in the documentation, but more efficient. Although the documentation states that Erase requires an Advanced license, it's included here as the most appropriate tool for the job, assuming it's available.\n3.

According to some champion select websites, I am being \"hard countered\", meaning I will have a very hard time in lane.\n\nThe thing is, I don't have any problems whatsoever playing against Teemo (in fact, I do a tiny cheer of joy knowing I can smash that little devil into oblivion). Some might say that a main Teemo player (Satan?) might have an easy time against a Darius since he can outpoke Darius. \n\nNow this would be an endless debate of summoners and skills. I'll keep my question as broad as possible:\n\n**On what basis do these websites state that champion A counters champion B?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **On what facts does countering a champion work?** It seems like this is your question which doesn't make complete sense to me but I'll have a go anyways. One thing you need to keep in mind is that those websites are crowd sourced and so are unreliable. Also, keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other. In low ELO a teemo will likely just try to auto Darius repeatedly taking minion aggro, losing farm, and not try to kite away from his grab. In high ELO Teemo will use bushes to avoid taking aggro and do a lot of hit/run feints so that he doesn't get grabbed easily while poking Darius down and denying him farm.\n\n**keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other.** This statement I made in the last paragraph is the most important. As a Poppy player I'll use her for example. One of my biggest counters is Darius. Why does he counter me? Well Poppy has a passive that reduces burst damage. Darius can bleed Poppy which does low damage and doesn't get reduced by her passive. Darius's ult also ignores Poppy's passive since it does true damage. This means that any trades they make Darius will win out because Poppy's greatest tool for reducing damage is negated. After the trades Poppy can't easily walk away because Darius can grab her and prolong the trade even more. This makes it EXTREMELY dangerous for Poppy to try to farm minion waves at all levels. Another example, Poppy vs Irelia. Irelia counters Poppy because she is more of an AA champion who does true damage and can slow/stun. If Poppy is winning in a trade, Irelia gets a free stun to prolong free damage and has an ability that does true damage. Rumble counters Poppy because she can safely burn Poppy with the low amounts of fire damage which don't get reduced by her passive.\n\nI'll look at another specific counter. Everyone knows that Trundle is a counter to Renekton but if you try to fight Renekton as Trundle early you will lose. Early game is simply about focusing on farming/sustaining as Trundle in this matchup. The reason Trundle counters Renekton is that Trundles ult essentially gets stronger from Renekton's ult. Renekton gets bonus health and Trundle simply steals that bonus health along with armor/MR on top of that. If you are the Renekton player going into this matchup and understand the counter you will realize that the first item you want to rush is a damage item. That's because if you get tanky first you are simply spending gold on stats for trundle to steal.\n\nEssentially, in order to counter Poppy you use a champion who doesn't get reduced damage vs her passive. You can apply this to other champions. If they have a strength that is negated or a weakness they can exploit by picking a champion, it's generally considered a counter in a broad sense. Keep in mind that all counters aren't equal though. You might pick a Riven to counter a Gnar.... but a good Gnar player will understand what makes Riven beat a Gnar in lane and focus on negating that advantage to make the lane more even.\n\nMany people will pick a champion against another simply because they want to **counter** them. The problem with this is that they won't understand what it is about the champion that counters the other champion and the way they play them won't actually be a counter because they don't understand reasoning for the counter."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about champion counters in League of Legends, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A professional League of Legends team is preparing for a crucial match where they expect the enemy team to pick Renekton in the top lane.
