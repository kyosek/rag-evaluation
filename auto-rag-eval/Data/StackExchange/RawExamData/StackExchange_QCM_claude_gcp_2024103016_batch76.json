I don't need volume mixing or selection, I just want to merge the two signals. \n\nI found [this instructable,](http://www.instructables.com/id/Altoids-Tin-18-Stereo-Mixer/) that has a very simple design. He essentially connects five jacks ground pins together, and then joins the left and right channels of each input jack to the corresponding pin on the output jack via a 1k resistor. \n\nIt almost seems to simple to me. I do not want to blow up the output jacks of my computers by applying an odd signal to them. Is this design safe to use? Can anybody explain what the purpose of the resistors is, and why it works or won't work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With 1K ohm resistors it is probably safe, but it will sound marginal to terrible. I wouldn't do a passive mixer for anything with inductive or capacative loads (headphones, speakers, etc.). \n\nIf your purpose is to hear something, anything, and not blow up your stuff then this will be fine. If your purpose is to actually enjoy music then don't bother.\n\nHeadphones (and speakers) need a low\\-impedance amplifier driving them. If you have a high impedance (or use something like a 1K resistor) then you are essentially causing the frequency response of the headphones to go from hopefully flat to something not even close. \n\nThink of it like this... \n\nImpedance is basically a frequency\\-dependent resistance. Your headphones have an impedance that can change a lot depending on frequency. However, they are also designed so that (hopefully) the frequency response is mostly flat for a given voltage input, despite the wacky impedance graph.\n\nNow you put a 1K ohm resistor in series with the headphone. That resistor, plus the impedance of the headphone, form a voltage divider. But the dividing ratio changes over frequency because the impedance changes over frequency. That causes what was a flat frequency response to become very much not flat."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio enthusiast wants to connect a single set of headphones to two computers simultaneously. They find a simple design that uses 1k ohm resistors to merge the signals. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this setup?\n\nA) The setup is ideal for high-quality audio enjoyment and will provide a flat frequency response.\n\nB) The design is completely unsafe and will likely damage the computer's output jacks.\n\nC) While safe, the setup will likely result in poor audio quality due to impedance mismatch and frequency response issues.\n\nD) The 1k ohm resistors are unnecessary and can be replaced with direct connections for better sound quality.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation states that while the setup with 1k ohm resistors is probably safe, it will result in marginal to terrible sound quality. This is due to the impedance mismatch created by the resistors, which causes the frequency response of the headphones to deviate significantly from flat. The resistors form a voltage divider with the headphone's varying impedance, leading to uneven frequency response. While the setup won't damage equipment (ruling out B), it's not ideal for audio enjoyment (ruling out A). The resistors serve a protective function and cannot be eliminated (ruling out D)."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/10/10", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/53652", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/3057/"], "docs_id": 53652, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In order to be able to import some data into a certain tool, I have to transform a CSV file from this format\n\n```\n\"data\",\"data\",\"data data\",\"data\",\"123\"\n\n```\n\ninto this format\n\n```\ndata;data;data data;data;123\n\n```\n\nThe columns never contain any `\"`, `;` or `,` but there can be spaces.

The idea is to describe two populations (one receiving an assistance program (the \"treatment\") and one not receiving it) via a summary statistic.\n\nThe first statistic that I am using is the difference in average wage\\-level post\\-treatment between the two populations.\n\nTo calculate a p\\-value for such a set\\-up, the idea is to make a large number $N$ of random permutations of the assignment vector (the list of 0's and 1's that indicates whether a given observation belongs to the control population or not). I calculate the summary statistic for each of these random assignments, to get a distribution of summary statistics in counterfactual experiments where the control group had been different.\n\nSince I also have the summary statistic for the observed assignment vector (the actual vector of 0's and 1's for the experiment that was truly observed), I can then count the number of simulated summary statistics which are more extreme than the observed summary statistic. \n\nThis proportion out of all of my simulated trials serves as the estimated p\\-value for my summary statistic.\n\nMy question is as follows: is there a standard way to get a standard error for such an estimated p\\-value? Obviously, I can calculate the Monte Carlo standard error for the summary statistics in my simulations, but since all of the simulations are used for just one single p\\-value calculation, it''s not clear how to get the standard error for that.\n\nI had the following thought about what the standard error might be in this case.\n\nIn usual Monte Carlo, we have some function $f$ that we compute at each of the simulated draws $x\\_{i}$ (where here, the $x\\_{i}$ are understood to be the assignment vectors). If I define:\n\n$$ f(x\\_{i}) \\= \\\\mathbb{1}\\_{ \\|stat(x\\_{i})\\| \\> \\|stat(x\\_{obs})\\| } $$\n\nthen it seems that the p\\-value I calculate is given by\n\n$$ \\\\hat{p} \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N}f(x\\_{i}) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{\\# more extreme}}{\\\\textrm{total samples}}$$\n\nAnd following the usual Monte Carlo formulas, would it then make sense to write the variance of the estimate as:\n\n$$ Var(\\\\hat{p}) \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N}\\[ f(x\\_{i}) \\- \\\\hat{p} ]^{2} $$\n\nand then take the square root to obtain the standard error?\n\nThe reason this confuses me is that for each $i$, $f(x\\_{i})$ will be binary, either the computed statistic was more extreme in that iteration or it wasn't. It seems like it would be error prone to sum up a bunch of binary things like that to estimate the variance in a p\\-value, but that could just be my unfamiliarity with this method.\n\nCan anyone confirm that this is right? Also, if I exposed any other ignorance about what I am doing here, corrective comments are appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have correctly computed the variance of $f$, not the variance of $\\\\hat{p}$.

So, even though for any one system, it is highly unlikely that it would be the lucky one, it is highly likely that *some* solar system would be the lucky one.\n\nAnd our solar system is that system.\n\nIn that sense, there is nothing special about our solar system. If it wasn't the solar system, then some other solar system out of all the billions and billions of suns would have been the one to be stable and have life evolve on it.

The stability of our solar system is not due to exceptional circumstances or precise initial conditions, but rather it is one example among countless planetary systems in the vast universe.

(Note that the `\\Needspace` macro is less precise than `\\needspace` in determining how much space there's left on the page.)\n\nOn a different subject, I've noticed that you have a lot of instances of `\\textsc{Lord}`; you may want to consider loading the `xspace` package, defining a macro such as\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\Lord}{\\textsc{Lord}\\xspace}\n\n```\n\nand then doing a global change from `\\textsc{Lord}` to `\\Lord` in the body of the document.

Once you realize that \\\\$i\\_2\\=i\\_3\\\\$ by symmetry, the node D is equipotential with C, the resistance through the ACB branch is the same than the ADB branch, and twice of the AB branch, and the total resistance is:\n$$r(2\\|\\|2\\|\\|1\\)\\=r(\\\\frac{4}{4}\\|\\|1\\)\\=r(1\\|\\|1\\)\\=\\\\frac{r}{2}$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit consists of six identical resistors of resistance r arranged in a hexagon shape, with points A and B at opposite corners.

This is how the forces work in your gate:\n\n[![Gate](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFnWh.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFnWh.gif)\n\nThe force being applied at the long end is the weight of the gate $mg$. If we take the top hinge as the pivot then the horizontal component of the force at the bottom hinge is $F \\= mg(a/b)$ just as in our right angled lever.\n\nWhy did I say *horizontal component of the force at the bottom hinge*? Well it's because there are other forces acting as well. The weight of the gate presses down with a force $mg$, but since the gate is not moving vertically there must be an equal and opposite force exerted by the ground at the bottom of the gate post. This force acts on the gate through the hinges, so assuming the two hinges carry the vertical load equally each hinge experiences an additional vertical force of $mg/2$.\n\nSo each hinge experiences a horizontal force $mg(a/b)$ and a vertical force $mg/2$ making the total force at each hinge:\n\n$$ F\\_{\\\\textrm{hinge}} \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(mg \\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{mg}{2}\\\\right)^2} \\= mg\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} $$\n\nSo depending on the dimensions of the gate the forces at the hinges can be greater or less than the weight of the gate. The condition for the forces at the hinges to be greater than the weight is:\n\n$$ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} \\\\ge 1 $$\n\nNote that $a$ is half the width of the gate so let's replace it by $a \\= w/2$ where $w$ is the width of the gate, and we'll assume the hinge spacing $b$ is approximately the height of the gate. Then our condition can be written as:\n\n$$ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{2h}\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} \\\\ge 1 $$\n\ngiving us:\n\n$$ \\\\frac wh \\\\ge \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac32} $$\n\nThough in practice the vertical load probably isn't shared equally between the hinges so this is a best case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A rectangular gate of width w and height h is supported by two hinges, one at the top and one at the bottom of the gate post.

However, my results show that the mean absolute error of Lasso or Elastic is around **0\\.61** whereas this score is **0\\.97** for the ridge regression. I wonder what would be an explanation for this. Is this because I have many features, and Lasso performs better because it makes a sort of feature selection, getting rid of the redundant features?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose you have two highly correlated predictor variables $x,z$, and suppose both are centered and scaled (to mean zero, variance one). Then the ridge penalty on the parameter vector is $\\\\beta\\_1^2 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2^2$ while the lasso penalty term is $ \\\\mid \\\\beta\\_1 \\\\mid \\+ \\\\mid \\\\beta\\_2 \\\\mid$. Now, since the model is supposed highly colinear, so that $x$ and $z$ more or less can substitute each other in predicting $Y$, so many linear combination of $x, z$ where we simply substitute in part $x$ for $z$, will work very similarly as predictors, for example $0\\.2 x \\+ 0\\.8 z, 0\\.3 x \\+ 0\\.7 z$ or $0\\.5 x \\+ 0\\.5 z$ will be about equally good as predictors. Now look at these three examples, the lasso penalty in all three cases are equal, it is 1, while the ridge penalty differ, it is respectively 0\\.68, 0\\.58, 0\\.5, so the ridge penalty will prefer equal weighting of colinear variables while lasso penalty will not be able to choose. This is one reason ridge (or more generally, elastic net, which is a linear combination of lasso and ridge penalties) will work better with colinear predictors: When the data give little reason to choose between different linear combinations of colinear predictors, lasso will just \"wander\" while ridge tends to choose equal weighting. That last might be a better guess for use with future data! And, if that is so with present data, could show up in cross validation as better results with ridge.\n\nWe can view this in a Bayesian way: Ridge and lasso implies different prior information, and the prior information implied by ridge tend to be more reasonable in such situations. (This explanation here I learned , more or less, from the book: \"Statistical Learning with Sparsity The Lasso and Generalizations\" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Martin Wainwright, but at this moment I was not able to find a direct quote).\n\n---\n\nBut the OP seems to have a different problem: \n\n> However, my results show that the mean absolute error of Lasso or\n>  Elastic is around **0\\.61** whereas this score is **0\\.97** for the\n>  ridge regression\n\nNow, lasso is also effectively doing variable selection, it can set some coefficients exactly to zero. Ridge cannot do that (except with probability zero.) So it might be that with the OP data, among the colinear variables, some are effective and others don't act at all (and the degree of colinearity sufficiently low that this can be detected.)

Which of the following best explains this unexpected result?\n\nA) Ridge regression is inherently less accurate than Lasso and ElasticNet for discrete variable prediction.\n\nB) The high number of features relative to the sample size is causing Ridge regression to overfit, while Lasso's feature selection property is beneficial in this scenario.\n\nC) The cross-validation method is biased against Ridge regression, leading to artificially inflated error rates.\n\nD) Ridge regression always performs worse when features are highly correlated, contradicting the common understanding of its behavior with multicollinearity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While Ridge regression is often considered more robust to multicollinearity, in this case, the high number of features (150) relative to the sample size (550) is likely playing a crucial role. Lasso regression performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, which can be beneficial when dealing with many features and a relatively small sample size. This feature selection property allows Lasso to effectively reduce the model's complexity, potentially leading to better generalization and lower error rates in this specific scenario. The question suggests that among the correlated variables, some may be more effective predictors than others, and Lasso's ability to identify and select these important features is resulting in better performance. ElasticNet, being a combination of Lasso and Ridge, likely benefits from this feature selection as well. While Ridge regression's tendency to distribute weights more evenly among correlated predictors can be advantageous in some cases, here it may be including too many irrelevant or redundant features, leading to higher error rates."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/05", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/213363", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/105797/"], "docs_id": 213363, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I installed an Ubuntu 12\\-04 LTS server for a special background music application of mine, where I am using the server with an Asus Xonar DS sound card.\n\nThe installation is successful, the MPD is working, the sound card is working with Alsa and its libraries installed except for `alsa-oss`.

In the given configuration, we can see that each 'stereo' definition includes a 'bindings' array with two numbers. These numbers correspond to the channel numbers in the 8-channel PCM slave definition. \n\nFor example, 'bindings [ 2 3 ]' for stereo1 means that channels 2 and 3 of the 8-channel output will be used for this stereo pair. This allows the system to split the 8-channel audio card into 4 distinct stereo outputs, which can then be individually addressed in the MPD configuration.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\nA) Volume levels are typically controlled by the mixer, not the bindings.\nB) Sampling rates are not set by the bindings parameter.\nC) Audio codecs are handled at a different level of the audio stack, not in the ALSA configuration.\n\nThis question tests understanding of ALSA configuration for multi-channel audio systems, which is a complex but important topic for advanced audio setups on Linux systems."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/02", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/11087", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/2241/"], "docs_id": 11087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a word or term commonly used to describe the act of stating the obvious (or a person who continually does so)?\n\n> He constantly states the obvious, he is such a *\\_*\\_.\n> \n> \n> She is always \\_\\_\\_ing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a somewhat insulting noun, \"[Captain obvious](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=captain+obvious)\" can be used for someone who is always stating the obvious. \n\n[Prolixity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolixity) can be used to describe someone who says *too much*.

Let $V$ be regular scheme of finite type over $\\\\text{Spec }k$ (not necessarily smooth). Is it true that $\\\\text{Spec }K\\\\times\\_{\\\\text{Spec }k}V$ is also regular?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, and it is only necessary to assume $K$ is separable over $k$ (i.e., not necessary to assume in addition that $k$ is algebraically closed in $K$). The idea is to use Serre's regularity criterion to reduce to the case when $K/k$ is finitely generated, and then use a separating transcendence basis in such cases to conclude.\n\nIn more detail, write $K \\= \\\\varinjlim K\\_i$ for subfields $K\\_i$ finitely generated over $k$, so all $K\\_i$ inherit $k$\\-separability from $K$. We may assume $V$ is affine, say $V \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(A)$. Clearly $K \\\\otimes\\_k A \\= \\\\varinjlim (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)$, so for any prime ideal $P$ of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ we have\n$$(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P \\= \\\\varinjlim (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_{P\\_i}$$\nwhere $P\\_i$ is the contraction of $P$ along $K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A \\\\rightarrow K \\\\otimes\\_k A$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over \n$(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ for a prime ideal $P$ of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$, so it is also finitely presented since $(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ is noetherian (as $A$ is finitely generated over $k$). For ease of notation, let $R \\= (K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ and let $R\\_i \\= (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_{P\\_i}$ for all $i$, so $\\\\{R\\_i\\\\}$ is a directed system of local rings with direct limit $R$. Note that the transition maps in this directed system are *flat*, and $\\\\dim R\\_i, \\\\dim R \\\\le \\\\dim(A)$.\n\nSince $M$ is finitely presented over $R$, clearly \n$M \\= R \\\\otimes\\_{R\\_{i\\_0}} M\\_0$ for some $i\\_0$ and a finitely generated $R\\_{i\\_0}$\\-module $M\\_0$. Assume the case of finitely generated separable extensions is settled, so the local noetherian ring $R\\_{i\\_0}$ is regular, visibly with dimension at most $\\\\dim(A)$. Hence, $M\\_0$ admits a finite projective resolution over $R\\_{i\\_0}$ of length at most $\\\\dim(A)$ by Serre's criterion. Applying the *exact* functor $R \\\\otimes\\_{R\\_{i\\_0}} (\\\\cdot)$ to this yields a finite projective resolution of $M$ over $R$ of length at most $\\\\dim(A)$. Thus, the local noetherian ring $R \\= (K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ has finite global dimension (at most $\\\\dim(A)$) since $M$ was arbitrary, so $R$ is regular by Serre's criterion. Since $P$ was arbitrary, it follows (by definition) that $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is regular. This completes the reduction to the case when $K$ is finitely generated over $k$.\n\nNow we may and do assume $K$ is finitely generated over $k$, so via the existence of a separating transcendence basis we reduce to the two special cases that $K \\= k(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n)$ or $K$ is finite separable over $k$. In the first case, $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is a localization of $A\\[x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n]$, and this polynomial ring is regular (since it is $A$\\-flat with fiber algebras over $A$ that are regular and even polynomial rings over fields), so $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is regular. In the second case one can conclude via the original definition of regularity via regular systems of parameters (any regular system of parameters in the local ring of $A$ at a prime $P$ is also a regular system of parameters in the local ring of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ in any prime over $P$ since $K \\\\otimes\\_k (\\\\cdot)$ commutes with the formation of Jacobson radicals in semi\\-local noetherian rings due to $K$ being finite separable over $k$).

The reason BYD requires communication is because in the event of an error, the BMS needs to be able to shut down the inverters without simply pulling the plug. This keeps the inverter IC on but the output at 0W. Furthermore, the BMS needs to be able to control the charge and discharge parameters in realtime. Removing this ability is paramount to throwing away your warranty and shortening your battery lifespan significantly. Not to mention any headaches/under\\-voltage/over\\-voltage shutdowns a person will encounter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A battery management system (BMS) for a lithium-ion battery pack requires communication with the inverter for several critical functions.

Options A, B, and C are all correct reasons mentioned in the documentation. The BMS needs to communicate with the inverter to safely shut it down in case of errors, control charge/discharge parameters in real-time, and maintain the warranty.

While the overall sample size is large (100,000), the rarity of the disease (0.1%) means there are only about 100 positive cases in the dataset. According to King & Zeng (2001), the bias in logistic regression is strongly dependent on the number of cases in the less frequent category, not just the overall sample size.

This is shown by considering how infinitesimal rotations affect wavefunctions in position space. The derivation starts with the action of a rotation operator on a position eigenstate and proceeds to show that the generator of these rotations has the form r \u00d7 p, which is the angular momentum operator.

Is it legitimate to reduce an endomorphism of E mod P?\n\nIn the chapter \"Complex Multiplication\" of the advanced arithmetic topics book by Silverman, a few propositions and theorems mention reducing an endomorphism mod P.\n\nA priori, this doesn't seem trivial to me. Sure, the endomorphism is comprised of two polynomials with coefficients in H. But I still don't see why if a point Q is in the kernel of reduction mod P, why is phi(Q) also there.

The reduction of endomorphisms modulo P is legitimate but not trivial.

What characteristic of my system make it true? (Is it true for my system because $m$ is the same for all pair of cities?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: More details of my comment: \n\nLet $\\\\{X\\_t\\\\}\\_{t\\=\\-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}$ be any irreducible and aperiodic discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) with finite or countably infinite state space $S$. Let $P\\=(P\\_{ij})$ be the transition probability matrix. Suppose $\\\\pi \\= (\\\\pi\\_i)\\_{i \\\\in S}$ is vector with nonnegative entries that sum to 1\\. Suppose also that $\\\\pi \\= \\\\pi P$ (where we view $\\\\pi$ as a row vector). Then, a fundamental theorem of Markov chains ensures $\\\\pi$ is the unique steady state distribution. The chain has been running since the beginning of time and so we imagine it to be in steady state at all times $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. So $P\\[X\\_t\\=i] \\= \\\\pi\\_i$ for all $t$. Define the \u201creversed\u201d probabilities $P^\\*\\_{ij}$: \n$$ P^\\*\\_{ij} \\= P\\[X\\_{t\\-1}\\=j \\| X\\_t \\= i] \\= \\\\frac{P\\[X\\_t\\=i\\|X\\_{t\\-1}\\=j]P\\[X\\_{t\\-1}\\=j]}{P\\[X\\_t\\=i]} \\= \\\\frac{P\\_{ji}\\\\pi\\_j}{\\\\pi\\_i} \\\\quad \\\\forall i, j \\\\in S$$\n\nWe define the DTMC to be *reversible* if $P^\\*\\_{ij} \\= P\\_{ij}$ for all $i,j \\\\in S$. Now you can see the reversible definition is equivalent to: \n$$ \\\\boxed{\\\\pi \\_i P\\_{ij} \\= \\\\pi\\_j P\\_{ji} \\\\quad \\\\forall i, j \\\\in S}$$ \nThe above boxed equations are called the *detail equations*. If you were to watch a reversible process on video, you would not be able to determine whether you are watching the video in forward motion or rewind motion, because (it can be shown that) the forward and reversed processes are statistically equivalent. \n\nNow, most ergodic DTMCs are *not* reversible. However, a class of processes called *birth\\-death processes* are known to be reversible. \nA *birth\\-death* process is a particular DTMC $X\\_t$ with state space $S \\= \\\\{0, 1, 2, ...\\\\}$ and where the state can increase or decrease by at most one on a single slot (either a \"birth,\" a \"death,\" or stay same). \nIt can be shown that if a birth\\-death process has a steady state distribution, then it must satisfy the detail equations. That is because steady states for birth\\-death processes satisfy the following *cut set equation* at every \"cut\" between states $i$ and $i\\+1$: \n$$ \\\\pi\\_i P\\_{i,i\\+1} \\= \\\\pi\\_{i\\+1}P\\_{i\\+1,i} $$ \n\nThe particular chain in your question looks like a 2\\-state process with states $0$ and $1$, and so the chain is indeed reversible with $\\\\pi\\_0 P\\_{01} \\= \\\\pi\\_1 P\\_{10}$. Even without the theory of birth\\-death processes, you can draw a generic picture of a 2\\-state chain with generic transition probabilities $P\\_{01}$ and $P\\_{10}$ and then show that, indeed, the steady state must satisfy $\\\\pi\\_0 P\\_{01} \\= \\\\pi\\_1 P\\_{10}$. \n\n---\n\nAn example is a discrete time \"B/B/1\" queue, where $Q(t)$ is the integer number of jobs queued at integer time $t$ and satisfies: \n$$ Q(t\\+1\\) \\= \\\\max\\[Q(t) \\- b(t), 0] \\+ a(t) $$\nwhere $\\\\{a(t)\\\\}\\_{t\\=0}^{\\\\infty}$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli arrivals with $P\\[a(t)\\=1]\\=\\\\lambda$, $\\\\{b(t)\\\\}\\_{t\\=0}^{\\\\infty}$ are independent and i.i.d. Bernoulli service opportunities (with $P\\[b(t)\\=1]\\=\\\\mu$) and with $0\\< \\\\lambda \\< \\\\mu\\<1$. This is a birth\\-death process. Since the arrivals to the queue are i.i.d. Bernoulli with rate $\\\\lambda$, the theory of reversibility shows that, in steady state, the departures from the queue are also i.i.d. Bernoulli with rate $\\\\lambda$. In particular, this means that we can analyze *tandems* of B/B/1 queues very easily.

This type of 2-state process falls under the category of birth-death processes, which are known to be reversible.\n\nBirth-death processes have the property that the state can only increase or decrease by at most one in a single time step, which is true for this scenario (Alice and Bob can only move from being in the same city to different cities or vice versa).\n\nFor birth-death processes, if a steady state distribution exists, it satisfies the detailed balance equations: \u03c0_i P_ij = \u03c0_j P_ji for all states i and j. This property ensures reversibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all Markov chains are reversible.

The ${BASH_REMATCH[1]} variable contains the first captured group, which is the first matching punctuation mark.\n\nC) This option correctly detects if the word contains any of the specified punctuation marks, but it always echoes the last character of the word, which may not be the punctuation mark we're looking for.\n\nD) This option uses external commands (grep and sed) which are less efficient than built-in bash features.

I have seen this warning in k\\-means outputs' provided ANOVA table, but in some references I see that post\\-hoc ANOVA tests are run. Should I ignore k\\-mean ANOVA outputs and run one\\-way ANOVA with post\\-hoc tests and interpret them in a traditional way? Or can I only imply about magnitude of F value and which variables contributed more to difference?\nAnother confusion is that clustering variables are not normally distributed violating assumption of ANOVA, then I could use Kruskal\\-Wallis non\\-parametric test, but it has assumption about the same distributions. The inter\\-cluster distributions for the specific variables do not seem the same, some are positively skewed, some are negatively...\nI have 1275 large sample, 5 clusters, 10 clustering variables measured in PCA scores. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No!\n\nYou *must* not use the same data to 1\\) perform clustering and 2\\) hunt for significant differences between the points in the clusters. Even if there's no actual structure in the data, the clustering will impose one by grouping together points which are nearby. This shrinks the within\\-group variance and grows the across\\-group variance, which biases you towards false positives.\n\nThis effect is surprisingly strong. Here are the results of a [simulation](https://gist.github.com/mrkrause/2b315222abd00c902a1d) that draws a 1000 data points from a standard normal distribution. If we assign the points to one of five groups at random before running the ANOVA, we find that the p\\-values are uniformly distributed: 5% of the runs are significant at the (uncorrected) 0\\.05 level, 1% at the 0\\.01 level, etc. In other words, there is no effect. However, if $k$\\-means is used to cluster the data into 5 groups, we find a significant effect virtually every time, *even though the data has no actual structure*.\n\n![Simulation results showing a uniform distribution of pvalues for the random assignments and a highly skewed (almost all 0.05 or less) distribution of p values after clustering](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LO8AF.png)\n\nThere is nothing special about a k\\-means or an ANOVA here\\-\\-you would see similar effects using non\\-parametric tests or logistic regression and a decision tree, even just taking the min/max.\n\nAfter you impose some kind of structure on the data, you cannot to test whether some structure exists, since it obvious does!. As a result, validating clustering algorithms' performance is tricky, particularly if the data are not labelled. However, there are a few approaches to \"internal validation\", or measuring the clusters' quality without using external data sources. They generally focus on the compactness and separability of the clusters. This [review](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/publication/internalmeasures.pdf) by Lui et al.

Option B suggests using a separate dataset, which is better but doesn't address the fundamental issue of validating unsupervised learning results. Option C incorrectly assumes non-parametric tests would solve the problem, when they suffer from the same fundamental issue as ANOVA in this context. Option D is correct because internal validation measures, which focus on cluster quality metrics like compactness and separability, are more appropriate for assessing the results of unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering without relying on external data or introducing bias."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/22", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/693729", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/17282/"], "docs_id": 693729, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm planning on receiving email/forwarding email using postfix, but sending email using sendgrid.\n\nAccording to this tutorial, I need an MX record pointing to my machine \\- [http://www.andreagrandi.it/2014/08/31/getting\\-started\\-with\\-digital\\-ocean\\-vps\\-configuring\\-dns\\-and\\-postfix\\-for\\-email\\-forwarding/](http://www.andreagrandi.it/2014/08/31/getting-started-with-digital-ocean-vps-configuring-dns-and-postfix-for-email-forwarding/)\n\nI've already set up sendgrid, and its working \\-\\> i sent a test email from ibrahim@mysubdomain.domain.com.
