A geodesic that crosses the horizon must reach the singularity and it cannot be analytically continued forward in time past the singularity. Hence the claim common in the popular science press that time stops at the centre of a black hole, just as it's claimed that time started at the Big Bang. Neither statement is especially helpful.\n\nIn both cases the proper length of the geodesic is finite. Since the elapsed time for an observer on the geodesic is just the length divided by $c^2$ this means the time from the Big Bang until now is finite, just as the proper time to hit the singularity in a black hole is finite."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the standard model of cosmology and the FLRW metric, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the age of the universe and the nature of the Big Bang?\n\nA) The Big Bang singularity is included in the topology of space-time, allowing for a precise calculation of the universe's age.\n\nB) The age of the universe cannot be estimated because the Big Bang singularity is at infinity and we approach it asymptotically.\n\nC) The FLRW metric allows for the calculation of a finite age of the universe, despite the Big Bang being a singular point that geodesics cannot be extended beyond.\n\nD) The age of the universe is infinite because time started at the Big Bang, which is a true singularity that cannot be reached through any path.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The FLRW metric, while treating the Big Bang as a singular point, doesn't specify that time starts there. It shows that geodesics cannot be analytically continued past this point, similar to how geodesics cannot be continued past a black hole singularity. However, the proper length of the geodesic from the Big Bang to the present is finite. This allows for the calculation of a finite age of the universe, even though the Big Bang singularity itself is not included in the space-time manifold.

(I strongly recommend never to do this outside of debugging and to let the metatable work as close to a normal tableas possible, otherwise you get all kinds of weird behavior.)\n\nSo, in order to detect changes to the global `debug` through metamethods, you have to delete the `debug` table. You can virtually put it back though the `__index` metamethod. Then you can use `__newindex` to detect attempts create a new global `debug` in which case you can print a warning, using the original debug table to get information about the responsible Lua function. In isn't that helpful though if it was reset e.g. in `\\directlua`, but you can use LuaTeX's status table to additionally provide the current TeX file and line.\n\nOf yourse you have to do this before loading anything which might be responsble, do it's best to put it even before `\\documentclass`:\n\n```\n\\directlua{\n  local debug = debug\n  local traceback, getinfo = debug.traceback, debug.getinfo\n  _G.debug = nil\n  setmetatable(_G, {\n    __index = {debug = debug},\n    __newindex = function(t, k, v)\n      if k == \"debug\" then\n        local guilty = getinfo(2)\n        texio.write_nl(\"We found the naughty party: \" ..

This method allows for precise tracking of when and where the 'debug' variable is being modified. By using the `__newindex` metamethod, you can intercept attempts to create or modify the global 'debug' variable. This approach provides detailed information about the function responsible for the change, including its name, source file, and line number. It can also leverage LuaTeX's status table to provide additional context about the current TeX file and line being processed. This method is superior to the other options as it provides a comprehensive and automated way to pinpoint the exact location and context of unwanted modifications to global variables, without needing to manually search through code or rely on less precise debugging techniques."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/23", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1027515", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/782651/"], "docs_id": 1027515, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have to struggle with the mouse cursor, to grab **the exact window edge or corner pixel** in order to resize.

There are two patches of ground near you, one containing a single frog, the other containing two frogs. Your survival depends on you finding a female frog in one of these two patches, but you only get to make one attempt. You cannot tell which frogs are which in advance, except that you know that one of the frogs in the patch with two frogs in is male.\n\nThe answer given to the riddle is that the odds of the single frog being female is 50%, but the odds of one of the two frogs being female is 2/3 (67%). The explanation being that there are four possible combinations of male female pairs, one is excluded because we know one frog is male, hence 2/3 combinations where we find a female frog in the pair and 1/3 where we don't.\n\nThe probabilities just seem wrong to me; can anyone clarify the reason why this is the case?\n\nI suspect that there is a subtly in the framing of the question that I'm missing.\n\nAs i read the problem, we have a choice of two options, both of which are simply a 50:50 chance of whether a single frog is male or female. Not knowing which frog in the pair is definitely male should have no effect on the probability of the other. \n\nIf I am wrong I really want to understand why!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's look at the pair of frogs. Male frogs are identified by croaking in the video. \n\nAs explained in the video, before we hear any croaking, there are 4 equally likely outcomes given 2 frogs:\n\n* Frog 1 is Male, Frog 2 is Male\n* Frog 1 is Female, Frog 2 is Male\n* Frog 1 is Male, Frog 2 is Female\n* Frog 1 is Female, Frog 2 is Female\n\nMaking the assumptions about males and females occurring equally and independently, our sample space is $\\\\{(M,M),(F,M),(M,F),(F,F)\\\\}$, and we have probability $1/4$ for each element.\n\nNow, once we hear the croak coming from this pair, we know that at least one frog is male. Thus the event $(F,F)$ is impossible. We then have a *new, reduced sample space* induced by this condition: $\\\\{(M,M),(F,M),(M,F)\\\\}$. Each remaining possibility is still equally likely, and the probability of all the events added together must be $1$. So the probability of each of these three events in the new sample space must be $1/3$.\n\nThe only event that ends badly for us is $(M,M)$, so there is a $2/3$ chance of survival.\n\n---\n\nMore formally, the definition of conditional probability says:\n\n$$P(A\\|B) \\= \\\\frac{P(A \\\\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nSo if $A$ is the event that at least one female is present and $B$ is the event that at least one male is present, we have:\n\\\\begin{align}P(\\\\text{F given at least 1 M}) \\&\\= \\\\frac{P(\\\\text{F and at least 1 male})}{P(\\\\text{at least 1 M})}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{P(\\\\text{1 M and 1 F})}{P(\\\\text{1 M or 2 M})} \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{P\\[(M,F),(F,M)]}{P\\[(M,M),(F,M),(M,F)]} \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{1/2}{3/4} \\= 2/3 \\\\end{align}\n\nThis is really the same procedure we reasoned through as above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the frog riddle:\n\nQuestion: A biologist is studying a population of frogs where males and females occur in equal proportions.

This problem involves conditional probability. \n\nFor Patch B with two frogs:\n- Before knowing one is male, there are 4 possible combinations: (M,M), (M,F), (F,M), (F,F).\n- Given that at least one is male, we can eliminate (F,F).\n- This leaves 3 equally likely scenarios: (M,M), (M,F), (F,M).\n- Two out of these three scenarios contain a female frog.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding a female frog in Patch B is 2/3.\n\nA (1/2) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the conditional information provided.\nB (1/3) is the probability of both frogs being male, which is not what we're looking for.\nD (3/4) would be the probability of at least one frog being female if we didn't know one was male.\n\nThis question tests understanding of conditional probability and the ability to reason through different possible scenarios given partial information."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/17", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1014770", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/64613/"], "docs_id": 1014770, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In searching this site for \"Chrome password\" I see lots of questions about how to get Chrome to remember a website password, but I have the opposite problem: I want Chrome to **STOP** asking if it should remember the password to a website.\n\nWhenever I visit a particular website, Chrome asks if it should remember the password, no matter how many times I answer \"Never\".

The map represents a development plan of a project we are working on. In this development plan we have different categories: buildings, streets, park area/open space, estates. \n\nAt first, I had a seperate layer for each categorie, until I realized that everytime a change is made in the plan, It is important to check all the other layers and make sure, that topology is still intact. I found this to be a hassle. So, I decided to put all categories in one layer, that way any changes that occur, will only effect one and one layer only. \n\nHowever, I have a lot of attributes that need to be implemented in the layer, the problem ist, that some attributes only apply to some categories and not others, and some attributes apply to all categories. For example: The attribute \"Name\" applies to all categories, but the attribute \"use\" is only for buildings, where I have predifined values. \n\nMy attribute table to growing rapidly and my capacity of keeping track of which attribute is set for which category is decreasing. For my collegues I often have to export only one category, and if I always manually delete unecessary attributes, mistakes are bound to happen. \n\nIs there a possibility in QGIS to only show/export the relevant attribute without me having to do so manually every time I want to look at my data?\n\nI have also considered trying out a database\\-solution like PostGIS, but I'm new to this, so I'm not really sure how I would organise it there either. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For using ArcGIS API for Python, credentials have to be provided `gis = GIS(\"http://www.arcgis.com\", \"username\", \"password\")`.\n\n```py\nfrom arcgis.gis import GIS\n\ngis = GIS(\"http://www.arcgis.com\", \"***\", \"***\")\nhelp(gis)\n\n```\n\nInformation from `help(gis)`\n\n```py\nclass GIS(builtins.object)\n |  GIS(url=None, username=None, password=None, key_file=None, cert_file=None, verify_cert=True, set_active=True, client_id=None, profile=None, **kwargs)\n |  \n |  .. _gis:\n |  \n |  A GIS is representative of a single ArcGIS Online organization or an ArcGIS Enterprise deployment.

That's because there is no way for the F\\-test to account for overfitting, so as long as the additional polynomial terms improve the in\\-sample fit even slightly, the null hypothesis of zero improvement will be false. In large data sets, you will very rarely fail to reject this hypothesis, even when the model is grossly overfitted.\n\nBy the way, an F test between models that differ by only one term is equivalent to a T test of the hypothesis that the one additional coefficient is zero.

It doesn't really have anything to do with whether the model is nonlinear or if you use a mixed model. The easiest way to get your model returned fitted with level means coding instead of reference level coding is to suppress the intercept when you have a factor variable. In R, this can be done with either `+0` or `-1`.

This ensures that both the polygon and its legend will show or hide together when toggled in the layers control. In the example provided, this is done by adding a 'group' parameter to the addLegend() function that matches the group name used in the addPolygons() function.

Assuming a big crunch scenario, will this dark energy \"go away\" again as the size of the universe decreases again, or will there be more energy (\\=mass) at the Big Crunch than at the Big Bang?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For low\\-frequency radiation, it's quite simple: there's some electronic circuit that works (simple case) analogous to a tuning fork, but instead of building up mechanical tension it charges a capacitor and instead of the inertia in the fork's arms it has a magnetic field in a solenoid. You can measure the voltage against time, count the oscillations in one second, and know your frequency in Hertz.\n\nFor visible light, this explanation doesn't quite work anymore, but still it's *kind of sort of* vibrations \u2013 on an atomic scale! These systems must be described in *quantum states*, and there's this thing that if a state has energy $E$ then you can assign it a frequency $\\\\nu \\= E/h$, where $h$ is the [Planck constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant). This frequency can't be observed directly, but what you can observe is, for a *quantum superposition* of two states with different energy $E\\_1, E\\_2$, that the system kind of \"wiggles\" with a frequency $\\\\Delta\\\\nu \\= \\\\tfrac{E\\_1 \\- E\\_2}{h}$.

We can use the equation \u0394E = h\u03bd, where \u0394E is the energy difference and \u03bd is the frequency.\n\n\u0394E = E1 - E2 = (6.0 x 10^-19 J) - (4.0 x 10^-19 J) = 2.0 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can solve for \u03bd:\n\u03bd = \u0394E / h\n\u03bd = (2.0 x 10^-19 J) / (6.63 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s)\n\u03bd = 3.02 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThis corresponds to answer A.

What is necessary to successfully open a bash in a chroot?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If `/bin/bash` is a binary with shared library dependencies, these dependencies needs to be able to be resolved within the chroot.\n\nOn my system:\n\n```\n$ ldd $( command -v bash )\n/usr/local/bin/bash:\n        Start            End              Type Open Ref GrpRef Name\n        0000115f08700000 0000115f08a0c000 exe  1    0   0      /usr/local/bin/bash\n        00001161f6a2e000 00001161f6c88000 rlib 0    1   0      /usr/lib/libtermcap.so.14.0\n        00001161bc41e000 00001161bc629000 rlib 0    1   0      /usr/local/lib/libintl.so.6.0\n        000011614b1de000 000011614b4dd000 rlib 0    2   0      /usr/local/lib/libiconv.so.6.0\n        00001161bd091000 00001161bd35b000 rlib 0    1   0      /usr/lib/libc.so.89.2\n        000011612ef00000 000011612ef00000 rtld 0    1   0      /usr/libexec/ld.so\n\n```\n\nIn contrast:\n\n```\n$ ldd $( command -v sh )\n/bin/sh:\n        Start            End              Type Open Ref GrpRef Name\n        000007ca3c446000 000007ca3c6c6000 dlib 1    0   0      /bin/sh\n\n```\n\nI'm on OpenBSD. The format of the output of `ldd` will be different on a Linux system, but the same essential information (what libraries are shared, and where they are) ought to be displayed on Linux as well.\n\nWhen I try with a *very* simplistic chroot that only contains `/bin/sh` and `/bin/bash` ([`doas`](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/doas.1) is OpenBSD's \"`sudo` replacement\"):\n\n```\n$ doas chroot -u kk t /bin/sh\n/bin/sh: No controlling tty (open /dev/tty: No such file or directory)\n/bin/sh: warning: won't have full job control\n$ /bin/bash\nAbort trap\n\n```\n\nNotice that I do get a shell (`/bin/sh`), but that `/bin/bash` fails. The error is different from yours but it has, I assume, the same cause. Executing `/bin/bash` directly with the `chroot` command just gives a one\\-word \"Abort\" message, again, presumably due to the same issue with libraries.\n\n**Conclusion:** *The chroot needs to contain at least a minimal installation of a system, including device files and libraries that are needed to run the executables within it.*\n\n**Explanation of the \"No such file or directory\" error on Linux:**\n\nI was a bit confused as to why the error was \"No such file or directory\" on Linux, so I ran a test through `strace`.\n\nThe `execve()` call that ought to have executed the shell returns ENOENT:\n\n```\nexecve(\"/bin/bash\", [\"/bin/bash\"], [/* 13 vars */]) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n\n```\n\n... so I thought it was something wrong with *finding `/bin/bash`*. However, upon reading the `execve(2)` manual, I saw:\n\n> `ENOENT` The file filename or a script or ELF interpreter does not exist, **or a shared library needed for file or interpreter cannot be found**.\n\nSo there you go."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to run a chrooted environment, you encounter the error \"No such file or directory\" when trying to execute /bin/bash. What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The /bin/bash file is missing from the chroot directory\nB) The chroot command was not executed with sudo privileges\nC) The shared libraries required by /bin/bash are not present in the chroot environment\nD) The /bin directory was not properly bind-mounted into the chroot environment\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe error \"No such file or directory\" when trying to execute a binary in a chroot environment can be misleading. While it might seem that the file itself is missing, this error can also occur when shared libraries required by the binary are not present in the chroot environment.\n\nAs explained in the documentation, if /bin/bash is a binary with shared library dependencies, these dependencies need to be resolved within the chroot. The error message \"No such file or directory\" can be triggered not only when the file itself is missing, but also when \"a shared library needed for file or interpreter cannot be found\", as stated in the execve(2) manual.\n\nTo successfully run /bin/bash in a chroot environment, you need to ensure that all necessary shared libraries and supporting files are present in the chroot directory structure. This often requires setting up a minimal system installation within the chroot, including required libraries, device files, and other system components.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the file itself is present, but its dependencies are missing. Option B is not the issue, as the error occurs after successfully entering the chroot.

Those loops are too squashed; I specified `in` and `out` angles correctly, but I want to take those arrows and \"stretch\" them in the direction orthogonal to them; more precisely, right now to obtain them one would have to take a `loop above` or `loop below` as the ones in the middle of the diagram, squash them vertically until they have almost zero height, then rotate them; how can I get those loops to look like what I described but without the squashing?\n\n**Edit:**\nHere is something close to what I want for 3, in particular the loops for V should be more slanted than this, like mirroring those for 6:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCdJP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCdJP.jpg)\n\n**Update:**\n\nProblems 2 and 3 are fixed, as my answer states.

You can use the `fit` library to fit an elliptical node around those elements; I used the remember picture, overlay options so the fitting node can be drawn outside the tikzcd environment.

How can it be mitigated to provide a good user experience?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What is \"eventual consistency\"? How does it compare to \"transactional consistency\"? When does it happen?\n\nConsistency models describe how a system (nominally a distributed system) responds to change.\n\n* In an eventually\\-consistent system, all nodes will eventually have a consistent view of the overall system state. However, there will be a period of time after the initial change in which different nodes will have different views of the state.\n* In a transactionally\\-consistent system, the point at which all nodes have a consistent view of state is defined by applying transactional boundaries to the change. Either the transaction completes or it fails, and the thing that initiated the change will know which has happened. All nodes will see the same state both before and after the transaction completes.\n\nHere's a real\\-world example: you go to your bank and deposit a check. You have initiated a change to two accounts: your account and the account of the person who wrote (issued) the check.\n\n* In a transactionally\\-consistent system, the addition of funds to your account happens at the same time as the removal of funds from the issuing account. At no point will the funds appear in both accounts (or in neither).\n* In an eventually\\-consistent system, the funds might be added to your account before they are debited from the issuing account. During some window of time, both accounts may show the added funds.\n\nThat latter scenario sounds very scary to most people. But it was exactly how the US financial system worked throughout the 20th century: you deposited a check, and that check was physically transported to the issuing bank, which then debited the money from the customer's account.\n\nWhen you design your system to be eventually consistent, you need to be aware of [problems that can arise from different nodes having different views of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_kiting), and take steps to compensate. However, this compensation can lead you down a rat hole if you're not careful; it's easy to spend exorbitant amounts of effort to prepare for the case where the airliner carrying the not\\-yet\\-cleared checks crashes and burns.\n\nOn the other hand, with a transactionally\\-consistent system, you have to be ready for the failure of any node (or communications channel) to mean the failure of the entire system (or at least of every attempted transaction)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a distributed banking system using eventual consistency, a customer deposits a check for $1000. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur immediately after the deposit?\n\nA) The depositor's account balance increases by $1000, but the issuer's account balance remains unchanged for a short period.\nB) Both the depositor's and issuer's account balances update simultaneously.\nC) The issuer's account balance decreases by $1000, but the depositor's account balance remains unchanged for a short period.\nD) Neither account balance changes until the check physically reaches the issuing bank.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: In an eventually consistent system, updates to different nodes (in this case, different bank accounts) may not happen simultaneously. It's more likely that the depositor's account would be credited first, while the issuer's account may not be debited immediately. This temporary discrepancy is a characteristic of eventual consistency, where different nodes may have different views of the system state for a short period before eventually becoming consistent. Option B describes transactional consistency, which is not the scenario described. Option C is unlikely as banks typically credit the depositor's account first. Option D describes an older banking system and doesn't align with the eventual consistency model described in the passage."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/08/23", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/724475", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/305985/"], "docs_id": 724475, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1Pm4.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1Pm4.jpg)\n\nHere is the picture of the actual question. Here how is it possible that the string on pulley 2 has different accelerations but is still taut? I didn't understand the question properly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, string on pulley 2 will have same acceleration and tension throughout its length. There is no possible way for a string to exert force in slack condition also a single piece of string cant have different tensions\\- it will have same tension force throughout its length.\n\nComing back to your question, constant velocity means that the object does not have any acceleration.\n\nSince $M\\_2$ is has more mass then $M\\_1$ therefore $M\\_2$ will move in downward direction with some acceleration and $M\\_1$ will go in upward direction with same acceleration.\nYou can calculate the tension in the string and their acceleration using simple equations. With the above motion ongoing on pulley 2, the whole setup will also be accelerating in downward direction due to pulley 1\\. So overall $M\\_1$ has two accelerations one is due to arrangement on pulley 2 \\- in upward direction and other is due to pulley 1 \\- in downward direction. For $M\\_2$ both accelerations are in downward direction. So for resultant motion as observed from ground, these two acceleration vectors (each) should be added for the two masses.\n\nFor $M\\_1$ to have constant velocity i.e. zero acceleration, sum of accelerations due to pulley 1 and 2 should be zero.\n\nEvaluate the above condition and you will get your answer.\nComment if your have any doubt in understanding the concept."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A pulley system consists of two pulleys as shown in the image.

This means the upward acceleration it experiences due to Pulley 2 must be exactly cancelled by the downward acceleration of the entire system due to Pulley 1. The tension in the string is uniform throughout its length, and M2 will have a greater downward acceleration than M1's upward acceleration. While M1 moves with constant velocity, it still experiences tension forces from the string, but these forces are balanced, resulting in no net force."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/17", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/203029", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/21921/"], "docs_id": 203029, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been looking for a phrase that would describe the opposite of putting two and two together.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"I thought Cindy's murder had everything to do with Mark's disappearance, but as it turns out, instead of putting two and two together and getting four, I put two and two together to get five, not realizing it was actually her estranged son that had done the deed!\"\n\nOr as someone else put it, I'm looking for a better way to say \"I came to the wrong conclusion\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Debunk*, as in *I **debunked** the idea of a correlation between A and B.* \n\nDefined by Google as:\n\n> expose the falseness or hollowness of (a myth, idea, or belief)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In investigative reasoning, what term best describes the process of disproving a previously held belief or connection between seemingly related events?\n\nA) Corroborating\nB) Debunking\nC) Substantiating\nD) Validating\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nB) Debunking is the correct answer.

(Note that the `\\Needspace` macro is less precise than `\\needspace` in determining how much space there's left on the page.)\n\nOn a different subject, I've noticed that you have a lot of instances of `\\textsc{Lord}`; you may want to consider loading the `xspace` package, defining a macro such as\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\Lord}{\\textsc{Lord}\\xspace}\n\n```\n\nand then doing a global change from `\\textsc{Lord}` to `\\Lord` in the body of the document. I'm surmising that this would make the code quite a bit more readable. Plus, if you ever want to change the \"style\" of the Lord's appellation (e.g., add a color), you'll only need to do so in one instance, i.e., in your document's preamble.\n\nAddendum: I can't help make but make two more quick observations related to the formatting/appearance of the document. First, verse 116:6 has a single, very short word (\"me\") on the second line; if you insert a tie (tilde) between the words \"helped\" and \"me\", you'll force the whole verse to occupy only one line. (A side benefit is that the entire 117th Psalm will now fit on the page as well.) Second, despite the fact that their size is `\\small`, the numerals at the start of each verse are quite obtrusive in appearance (in part because they're in boldface).

This seems to have worked fairly well. Imported as a layer into QGIS, it overlays the Google imagery from the Open Layers plugin well enough for my current use.\n\nSince I have a little more drawing control, I've been trying to use AutoCAD map for creating the features (call this the \u201cmaster.dwg\u201d). I imported the TIFF file and drew a few features based on the TIFF image. Exported them to shapefiles, opened in QGIS and this looked pretty good as well (with the previous TIFF and OpenLayers shown).\n\nMy next step was to create a layout of one of the sections in AutoCAD map. I created a drawing using architectural units so I could enter values as 25\u2019 6\u201d, etc. Once I completed the layout, I tried inserting the section into the master.dwg. For some reason, the scales seem to be massively out of whack. Basically, the inserted section is probably hundreds of times larger than the georeferenced TIFF. The large dimension of the section is only about 200 feet, yet when zoomed to extents, the TIFF file doesn't even appear. It is necessary to zoom in quite a bit before it even appears as point in the drawing.\n\nUsing the measure tool in AutoCAD, measuring the distance between two known points on the TIFF literally registers a Zero (I would have expected it to be about 200 ft). In QGIS, it measures about as expected.\n\nAny thoughts as to what is happening here? I'm at a loss right now.\n\n\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\n\nI've made a little progress. Today, I was able to get some shapefiles from our local GIS dept. of the area around the cemetery. I've tried MAPCONNECT and MAPIMPORT with the same results... I create a new drawing, assign the projection (MI83\\-SIF) and then attach / import the shapefiles. Units for the drawing are standard decimal. Using the MEASUREGEOM, I measure between two points and get 204 (which is what I would expect in feet). When I change the units to Architectural, then MEASUREGEOM returns just over 17'. So, it appears that, while \"204\" in the shapefile should be feet, AutoCAD Map is interpreting it as inches.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After drawing with arch units you can switch back to engineering.  \n\nThen you need to assign the coord sys in map.  \n\nAfter which upon insert of your tiff be sure to use the Map image insert (not the normal insert pulldown) and double check that the units is not inches"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An AutoCAD Map user is experiencing issues with scale when inserting a georeferenced TIFF and other features into their drawing.
