As far as I see, \"tax returns\" are actually *tax declarations*, i.e. a set of documents filed by e.g. an individual and sent to the government's financial authorities to declare his/her income, so that the government can decide on this individual's income tax. If this is correct, why is this called a \"return\"? Nothing gets returned here. A document gets handed out. There is even not money to be returned, rather there will be money to be paid. (Exception: German employees, on filing their tax declaration often get back parts of taxes paid on their behalf by the employer because employers are obliged to send part of the monthly salary directly to the financial authorities, and depending on circumstances, employees can get back overpaid taxes by the end of the year. This, I would say, is indeed literally a *tax return*.)\n\n2\\) Usage\n\nClearly \"tax return\" is in use in the USA. Question: could or should I use it also in international contexts (everywhere outside the US)? Or should I better use a more generic term such as *tax declaration*? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: See this definition for **return** (noun):\n\n> An official report or statement submitted in response to a formal demand.  \n> \n>  \u2018census returns\u2019  \n> \n> [SOURCE](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/return)\n\nThe *Oxford English Dictionary* has examples going back to 1618"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the origin and appropriateness of the term \"tax return\" in financial contexts?\n\nA) The term originates from the fact that taxpayers often receive money back from the government after filing their taxes.\n\nB) \"Return\" in this context refers to the act of submitting an official report in response to a formal demand, a usage dating back to the early 17th century.\n\nC) The term is a misnomer and should be replaced with \"tax declaration\" in all contexts, especially in international communication.\n\nD) \"Tax return\" is exclusively an American term and should not be used in international contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The term \"tax return\" is appropriate because \"return\" in this context refers to submitting an official report in response to a formal demand, as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary. This usage dates back to 1618, predating modern tax systems. While option A may be true in some cases, it's not the origin of the term. Option C is incorrect because the term is not a misnomer given its historical usage. Option D is also incorrect, as the term's origin and meaning make it suitable for use in international contexts, not just in the USA."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/31", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/326810", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/19048/"], "docs_id": 326810, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $k$ be a field (of possibly positive characteristic), let $U\\_n$ denote the space of all $n \\\\times n$ unipotent upper triangular matrices over $k$, and let $G$ be an algebraic subgroup of $U\\_n$ (hence a unipotent algebraic group itself). Then each $X \\\\in \\\\text{Lie}(G)$ (thought of as a member of $\\\\text{Lie}(U\\_n)$, i.e. a strictly upper triangular $n \\\\times n$ matrix) is nilpotent, so it makes sense to define\n\n$\\\\text{exp}(X) \\= 1 \\+ X \\+ X^2/2! \\+ \\\\dots \\+ X^{n\\-1}/(n\\-1\\)!$\n\n(This definition makes sense even in characteristic $p \\> 0$ so long as $p \\\\geq n$, i.e. so that $p$ never divides $1!, 2!, \\\\dots, (n\\-1\\)!$).

Or, equivalently, for $X \\\\in \\\\text{Lie}(G)$, is $\\\\text{exp}(X) \\\\in G$?\n\nI feel like there should be an obvious proof of this, but I don't see it. If $G$ were a Lie group, the Lie algebra of $G$ would often just be defined to\nbe all $X$ such that $e^{tX} \\\\in G$ for all $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, and so for Lie groups $\\\\text{exp}$ maps from $\\\\text{Lie}(G)$ to $G$ simply by definition.

Is a bivector a two\\-form?\n2. Why a bivector is simply a vector in 3 dimensions?\n3. How to distinguish between vectors and bivectors in 3D?\n4. Why all bivectors are not vectors in 4D?\n5. How to imagine the dual of a bivector?\n6. How can a bivector be non\\-simple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A bivector is an element of $\\\\bigwedge^2 V$, so it is dual to a $2$\\-form on $V$. You can think of a bi\\-vector as a tiny piece of area. \n\nIf $V$ is three dimensional and comes with an inner product, then one can choose an isomorphism between $V$ and $\\\\bigwedge^2 V$ which commutes with all the orthogonal maps for your inner product. In elementary math, this is the map which we call the cross product. This is not quite unique; you have to decide whether to use the left\\-hand\\-rule or the right\\-hand\\-rule to take cross products.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to learn to distinguish between vector and bivectors is to get in the habit of not identifying $V$ and $V^\\*$. One way to do this is to work with an inner product given by an arbitrary symmetric matrix $g$ and keep the matrix $g$ in all your computations, rather than changing to an orthonormal basis. \n\nA quicker way which I find useful is to think about whether the quantity in question has a natural direction, or has a sign ambiguity which comes from some arbitrary convention. For example, the normal vector to an orientated surface in $3$ space is going to be a bivector, because we need to decide whether the orientation circles the normal to the left or the right.\n\nWriting down a bi\\-vector in $d$ dimensions takes $\\\\binom{d}{2}$ coordinates. So, for $d \\= 4$, we need $6$ coordinates and we can't fit them into a single vector. I'm guessing that \"simple\" means a wedge of two vectors.

By patching the internal commands of algorithm2e, we can automatically wrap the algorithm content in a minipage environment, effectively reducing its width without directly using minipage in the document body.\nD) Changing from ruled to boxruled doesn't address the width issue; it only changes the style of the surrounding box.\n\nThe correct solution involves using etoolbox to patch the algorithm2e internals, allowing for a more elegant and reusable way to control the algorithm's width throughout the document."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/01/20", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/182853", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/111405/"], "docs_id": 182853, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In our upstairs bathroom, the toilet and cold faucet in the sink stop working every winter when it is cold.\n\nThe shower works and the hot water at the sink faucet work.\n\nWe have tried heating up the room to 85\\.

The toilet and cold water faucet stop working, while the shower and hot water faucet continue to function. What is the most likely cause of this problem and the recommended long-term solution?\n\nA) The issue is caused by a faulty water heater, and the solution is to replace it.\nB) The problem is due to frozen pipes in the attic or walls, and the solution is to properly insulate the cold water pipes.\nC) The issue is caused by air locks in the plumbing system, and the solution is to frequently bleed the lines.\nD) The problem is due to low water pressure during winter, and the solution is to install a pressure booster pump.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The problem described in the documentation strongly suggests frozen pipes, particularly affecting the cold water supply. This is evident from the fact that only the cold water faucet and toilet (which uses cold water) are affected, while the hot water and shower continue to work. The homeowner mentions that the cold water line likely goes into the attic, which is a vulnerable area for freezing.\n\nThe correct long-term solution is to properly insulate the cold water pipes, especially in areas exposed to cold temperatures like the attic or exterior walls. This will prevent the pipes from freezing during winter and avoid potential pipe bursts, which could lead to expensive water damage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a faulty water heater would not explain why only the cold water is affected.\nOption C is incorrect because air locks are unlikely to be the primary issue, given the seasonal nature of the problem.\nOption D is incorrect because low water pressure would typically affect both hot and cold water, not just the cold water supply."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/06", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/264794", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/138148/"], "docs_id": 264794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just downloaded ubuntu yesterday then i installed it (Ubuntu 12\\.10\n\nI did not do any partitions just automatic installing it\n\nIs it completely gone?\n\nUhm i have my games inside the C:\\\\\n\nI wanted to play it on Ubuntu\n\nWhere can i find my games :)\n\nPlease answer thank you :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems you have erased your Windows.

An abstract class was created which raised exceptions if called directly:\n\n```\n- (void)startAnalyticsSession\n{\n    [NSException raise:NSInternalInconsistencyException\n                format:@\"You must override %@ in a subclass\", NSStringFromSelector(_cmd)];\n}\n\n- (void)stopAnalyticsSession\n{\n    [NSException raise:NSInternalInconsistencyException\n                format:@\"You must override %@ in a subclass\", NSStringFromSelector(_cmd)];\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is a rough example of the [adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern). In your case, you could create an abstract class with these stubbed out methods which all other classes inherit from."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Objective-C, you have a base class KObject that should not be instantiated directly but needs to provide common functionality to its subclasses Teacher, Student, and Class. Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate way to implement this design while ensuring KObject cannot be instantiated?\n\nA) Declare KObject as a protocol instead of a class\nB) Use the @abstract directive on the KObject class declaration\nC) Implement KObject as a normal class and trust developers not to instantiate it\nD) Create KObject as a class with stubbed methods that raise exceptions if called directly\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate solution for this scenario in Objective-C. By creating KObject as a class with stubbed methods that raise exceptions if called directly, you achieve several goals:\n\n1. It allows subclasses to inherit properties and methods from KObject.\n2. It prevents direct instantiation of KObject by causing runtime exceptions if its methods are called without being overridden.\n3. It follows the adapter pattern, which is a common approach for creating abstract-like classes in Objective-C.\n4. It provides clear feedback to developers who might mistakenly try to use KObject directly.\n\nOption A (using a protocol) would not allow for shared property implementation. Option B is incorrect because Objective-C doesn't have an @abstract directive. Option C relies solely on developer discipline, which is not a robust solution for enforcing design constraints."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/30", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/420654", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/222643/"], "docs_id": 420654, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From a file like this one (phylogenetic tree in which branch supports are between 0 and 1\\):\n\n```\n(AJirio:0.00207,(AJama:0.00176,(AJtok:0.00034,AJkago:0.00057)0.832000:0.00080)0.934000:0.00111)0.923000\n```\n\nI need to obtain this (phylogenetic tree in which branch supports are integers between 0 and 100\\):\n\n```\n(AJirio:0.00207,(AJama:0.00176,(AJtok:0.00034,AJkago:0.00057)83:0.00080)93:0.00111)92\n```\n\nThe differences between the two are in bold.

You can even skip the ultimate at level 6\\.\n\nOK so now that the skills are clarified, let's talk about how to actually play with this hero... The idea is that is better to go on a side lane than mid lane, because on the middle the distance between your tower and the enemy tower is relatively small.

The thing with Diabolic Edict is that you need to isolate your target and stay near him.\n\nAs for what items to buy.. at the beginning you need some strength because you are very low hp, some hp and mp regen...\ngood items on leshrac are bloodstone, aghanim, shiva, guinsoo, heart, travel(or in early game you can make arcane boots and dissemble then when building the bloodstone)...\n\nhope this helps"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following strategies is most effective for playing Leshrac in the early game, according to the given information?\n\nA) Prioritize leveling up Lightning Storm and play aggressively in the mid lane\nB) Focus on increasing Intelligence to maximize mana pool and spell damage\nC) Level up Diabolic Edict and Split Earth, and play in a side lane to isolate targets\nD) Increase Strength attributes and rush Bloodstone as the first major item\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that skill points should go into Diabolic Edict and Split Earth (in that order) early game, while potentially skipping the ultimate at level 6. It also recommends playing in a side lane rather than mid lane, as the longer distance between towers allows for better isolation of targets when using Diabolic Edict. The strategy involves waiting for low HP creeps, stunning the target with Split Earth, moving close, and casting Diabolic Edict for maximum effectiveness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation advises against prioritizing the lightning skill early game. Option B is not recommended as it suggests focusing solely on Intelligence, which the initial question implies is not ideal.

Instead of graphing A3:A1000 as your Series 1 Y values, you could assign A3:A1000 to the named range Series\\_1\\_Y. Edit your data for the graph and then edit the series and use the named range instead.\n\nYou can define names here:\n\n[![PIC1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUktG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUktG.png)\n\nThat would be the basic concept of named range, but you need it to be more advanced and to be dynamic. There are a few way to achieve this. The basic thing you are going to need to do is determine the number of entries to include. Or in other words the number of rows. You can do this with the COUNT, COUNTIF, COUNTA and the like. You can then combine those results for use in something like OFFSET or INDEX. \n\nIn terms of using OFFSET or INDEX, offset is a volatile function, which means it recalculates everytime ANYTHING on the spreadsheet changes. INDEX on the other hand will only recalculate when when something that affects it changes. So depending on how frequently the formula gets used or the size of the calculation, INDEX won't bog your system down as much.\n\nSince you do not have example data, I will work with the following layout:\n\n[![Pic2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ceNjw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ceNjw.png)\n\nYou can count you entries in a variety of ways. two options are as follows:\n\n```\n=COUNT(A:A)\nor\n=COUNTIF(A3:A8,\"<>#N/A\")\n'note the above only works for string version of NA\n'and adjust characters to match your spelling\n\n```\n\nThe formula you will want to use in your \"Define Name\" formula will be something to the effect of:\n\n```\n=$A$3:INDEX($A$3:$A$8,COUNT($A:$A)\n\nor\n\n=OFFSET($A$3,0,0,COUNT($A:$A),1)\n\n```\n\n[![PIC3](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T11bc.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T11bc.png)\n\nRepeat the process for your second series changing the reference column\n\nwhen working with your graph data you will need to have saved your spreadsheet first as your workbook name needs to be a part of the series name. I saved my work book as Dtest.xlsx and you can see the \"Define Name\" being used as the series below:\n\n[![PIC4](https://i.stack.imgur.com/csSCr.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/csSCr.png)\n\n[![Pic5](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dV1hI.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dV1hI.png)\n\n[![pic6](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQIfY.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQIfY.png)\n\nNote that if your workbook contains a space in the name surround the name in single quote/apostrophe as follows:\n\n```\n'Dtest Two.xlsx'\n\n```\n\nCaveat: you cannot have any other numbers in the column and your numbers will need to be continuous from their starting point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided Excel documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're creating a dynamic combination graph in Excel with two data series that will grow over time.

It's dynamic and will automatically adjust as new data is added.\n2. INDEX is not a volatile function, unlike OFFSET, so it won't recalculate unnecessarily and slow down your workbook.\n3. COUNT will work well with numerical data, which seems to be the case in this scenario.\n4. This method doesn't require manual intervention each time data is updated.\n\nOption A is close but uses OFFSET, which is volatile and less efficient than INDEX.\nOption B (pivot chart) is a good solution for many scenarios, but it's overkill for this simple data structure and doesn't match the described approach.\nOption D (manual adjustment) is time-consuming and prone to error, defeating the purpose of creating a dynamic chart."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/16", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/68854", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/9298/"], "docs_id": 68854, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to understand C\\+\\+ friend.

We start with a given graph. At each time step we delete an edge $(i,j)$ and add two edges $e$ and $f$; the edge $e$ is incident with $i$ and a neighbour of $j$ (which is not already a neighbour of $i$), and the edge $f$ is incident with $j$ and a neighbour of $i$ (which is not already a neighbour of $j$). A stable configuration is a graph in which a step of the process gives an isomorphic graph. I would like to collect some information about the behaviour of the process and its stable configurations. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simone, this is really just a long comment rather than an answer, but I hope it'll be helpful.\n\nFirst of all, thank you for the clarifications. If I understand correctly now, the process at each step requires finding a path of length 3, $hijk$, with $h$ not connected to $j$ and $i$ not connected to $k$. The step itself consists of deleting the edge $ij$ and adding edges $e \\= ik$ and $f\\=hj$, and the process terminates when there is no path that meets the requirements. \n\nIt seems sensible to start by describing which graphs are \"terminal.\"\n\nNote the process doesn't change the connectivity of the graph, so we may as well assume that the initial graph $G$ is connected. \n\nOne type of (connected) graph that is terminal is one that has no paths of length 3 at all \\-\\- i.e., a \"star,\" all of whose edges emerge from a single, central point.\n\nAt the other end of the terminal spectrum are the complete graph, the complete graph minus one edge (I believe you mentioned this graph in an early version of the problem), and the complete graph minus two edges with a common vertex.\n\nOne pertinent question is, are there any other types of terminal graphs?\n\n(**Added 11/14/11**: In a comment on Joseph O'Rourke's animated graphics, Brendan McKay notes that the complete graph minus *any* number of edges incident on a common vertex is terminal. How I failed to see that is anybody's guess. So the amended pertinent question is, does *this* exhaust the list of terminal graphs?)\n\n(**Added later on 11/14/11**: Sergey Norin has effectively answered the amended pertinent question. The set of terminal graphs is precisely the set of \"trivially perfect\" graphs. See Sergey's answer for an explanatory link.)\n\nI think what you're really asking is whether there are any graphs for which the selection of steps in the process can result in two different terminal graphs. It might be worth seeing what happens for connected graphs of small size, say with 5 or 6 vertices. (Actually 4 is a reasonable size to start with, but it doesn't take long to see that everything non\\-terminal terminates in the complete graph minus one edge.)\n\nI tried one example with 5 edges: Starting from a single closed loop of length 5 (i.e., the perimeter of a pentagon), I found the process always terminates in the complete graph minus one edge. Maybe someone can flesh this out to a complete analysis of the 5\\-vertex case. Whether this will help understand what happens in general is anybody's guess, but at least it'd get things started.\n\n**Added 11/16/11**: I'm adding something here that I originally posted as a comment, and expounding on it a little, because it may have gotten lost in the shuffle.\n\nIf you start with a complete graph minus the 3 edges AD, AE, and BC, then you can terminate in one step by deleting AB and adding AD and BC, or in two steps by deleting CD and adding AD and BC (followed by the deletion of DE and addition of AE and CD). So there certainly are some graphs for which the terminal state depends on the selection of steps.\n\nThus is may be of interest to distinguish between graphs whose terminal state is \"predestined\" regardless of the steps they take, and those that have \"free will\" to choose, say between the Heaven of one terminal state and the Hell of some other. E.g., the closed loop of length 5 is predestined to end as the complete graph (on 5 vertices) minus one edge, whereas the complete graph minus edges AD, AE, and BC has free will."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a graph transformation process where at each step, an edge (i,j) is deleted and two new edges e and f are added.

The screen is \"wide\" not \"tall.\" Smart phones have done something rather cool by enabling the orientation of the phone to influence how the content is presented.\n\nI'd like to do this with media queries, so that if someone on a mac with a big monitor has their browser window sized so that it's very \"tall\" (height is greater than width) they would see a header and footer. But if they went fullscreen or \"wide\" (width is greater than height) they would see a sidebar on the left and maybe also the right.\n\nI'm trying to take full advantage of wide screens, and orientations and such. How to do this with media queries or javascript?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm sure you have it by now, but here is an example for others who pass by. Like the previous person said, people should take the time to read this: [http://www.w3\\.org/TR/css3\\-mediaqueries/](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)\n\n**Now**, here is an answer. You can put \"landscape\" or \"portrait\" in conjunction with widths and heights in your @media rules. This assumes that height is greater than the width and vice versa. I usually only use min\\-width and then have a few separate @media rules for those specifically. One example would be landscape: horizontal scroll (desktop) and portrait: regular vertical (tablet/phone )\n\nThose 2 wouldn't do it alone though, you'll need some combinations. I think we can assume your sidebar would be a hindrance on screens smaller than 600px wide.\n\n```\n/* 01 */\n@media (min-width: 0) {\n   /* this is the same as not using a media query... */\n   .main-content {\n     width: 100%;\n     float: left;\n   }\n\n   .side-bar {\n     width: 100%;\n     float: left\n   }\n\n}\n\n/* 2 */\n@media (min-width: 600px) and (orientation:landscape) {\n\n   .main-content {\n     width: 70%;\n     float: left;\n   }\n\n   .side-bar {\n     width: 30%;\n     float: left\n   }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n[HERE is a jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/sheriffderek/JNK54/) \\- note that box\\-sizing: border\\-box; is used for padding issues.\n\n2017 UPDATE\n-----------\n\nI think most people would use flexbox now: <https://jsfiddle.net/sheriffderek/egxcgyyd/>\n\n```\n.parent {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) and (orientation:landscape) {\n  .parent {\n    flex-direction: row;\n  }\n  .child-1 {\n    min-width: 260px; /* or flex-basis: xx - try them both */\n  }\n  .child-2 {\n    flex-basis: 100%; /* \"if at all possible... please try to be this size...\" */\n  }\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're developing a responsive website that needs to adapt its layout based on both screen size and orientation.

It sets a minimum width of 600px and landscape orientation as conditions, uses flex-direction: row to create a horizontal layout, sets a specific width for the sidebar (child-1) using flex-basis, and allows the main content (child-2) to take up the remaining space with flex-basis: 100%. This approach is flexible and adapts well to different screen sizes while maintaining the specified layout requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses fixed percentage widths, which are less flexible than the flex-basis approach.\nOption B is incorrect because it only defines the layout for small screens or portrait orientation, not for the desired landscape layout.\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't include the minimum width condition and uses a mix of width and flex properties, which can lead to inconsistent results."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/21", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/202584", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/86437/"], "docs_id": 202584, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a nice ocean monument, all emptied of water.

Of course, any able reader of the term should be able to take some initiative and find out what it means themselves.

Rarely did I start these projects \\- most are takeover work.\n\nOne thing that seemed constant everywhere was that there was a single global SQL Server user account that this application used that granted it permission to the common database, and yes in some naive situations it used the `sa` user account, which I generally tried to fix when possible.\n\nYou can't really effectively hide this username and password that the application uses to access the database. They're usually stored in an `ini` or `config` file, or possibly baked into the executable itself. In all cases, they're visible to the user if they do a little digging. In one case we actually used a `config` file but encrypted it, but of course the encryption key had to be stored in the executable (we weren't naive to the limitations of this, but it did effectively stop people from poking around who were savvy enough to look in `config` files).\n\nAll of these systems had a user\\-authentication system built into the application, but of course they were all managed through the application itself, meaning the user information was stored in the database. The application restricted what things you could do based on your access level, but it's all kind of moot if you can just connect to the database and run ad\\-hoc queries.\n\nI'm interested to know what other systems do to get around this problem. Here are the options I know of:\n\n1. Use SQL Server's security mechanism to maintain a user and roles list, and make the desktop application add and remove users through T\\-SQL queries.\n2. Instead of connecting directly to the database, create some kind of web service that runs on the server and put the authentication logic in there. Make every request do security validation.\n\nThe first options is a bit ugly because you're separating users from the database so users are no longer first class entities and you can't reference them with foreign key relationships, etc.\n\nThe second just seems like a major performance problem, and a lot of extra work, plus you can't as easily use ORM mappers like NHibernate (I think).\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Best practices?\n\n**Edit**\n\nThinking a bit more, can SQL Server Authentication actually solve this problem? For instance, if your user must be able to insert and update timesheet records so you can edit your timesheet, there's no way SQL server can disallow access to other rows in the timesheet details table, meaning you can read and write *other* people's timesheets too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm afraid adding a Web Service layer is probably the correct solution to your problem.\n\nSeparating the client from the underlying database implementation will probably help you in the long run too.\n\nAdding a web service layer doesn't necessarily have to hurt performance...\n\nIndeed, with an appropriate API, a web service can actually improve performance, by batching together multiple database queries within the data center LAN, rather than requiring multiple round trips over the WAN.\n\nAnd of course a web service layer can often be scaled horizontally, and add appropriate caching to your database queries, perhaps even a change notification mechanism.\n\nA server layer adds security that you cannot possibly ensure with apps running on a remote client. Anything that runs on a client can be \"hacked\" and should not really be considered in any way trusted. You should only really put presentation logic in the client, and host anything important on hardware you have complete control of.\n\nI don't know about your apps, but my web apps are naturally split into several layers, with the presentation code separated from the persistence layer by at least one level of business logic that keeps the two apart. I find this makes it much easier to reason about my app, and so much faster to add or modify functionality. If the layers are separated anyway, it is relatively easy to keep the presentation layer in the client, and the rest on a server under my control.\n\nSo while you can solve your problems without introducing a \"web service\" layer, by the time you have written all the stored procedures (or equivalent) necessary to fill in the holes in the standard database security implementation, you would probably be better off writing a server\\-side application that you can write proper unit tests for."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a new desktop application that needs to access a SQL Server database. They want to ensure proper security and performance. Based on the information provided, which of the following approaches would be the most appropriate solution for this scenario?\n\nA) Use SQL Server's built-in security mechanism to maintain user and role lists, implementing all authentication logic through T-SQL queries.\n\nB) Store the database credentials in an encrypted config file, with the encryption key embedded in the executable.\n\nC) Implement a web service layer between the client application and the database, handling authentication and data access through this intermediary.\n\nD) Use a single global SQL Server account with full permissions for all client applications to access the database.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most appropriate solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Security: A web service layer adds a crucial security barrier between the client and the database. It prevents direct client access to the database, mitigating risks associated with storing credentials on the client-side.\n\n2. Scalability: Web services can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load, which is not easily achievable with direct database connections.\n\n3. Performance: Contrary to initial concerns, a well-designed web service can improve performance by batching queries and reducing round trips over the network.\n\n4. Flexibility: It allows for easier implementation of complex business logic and caching mechanisms.\n\n5. Maintainability: Separating the client from the database implementation makes the system easier to maintain and modify in the long run.\n\nOption A is less ideal because it doesn't solve the issue of protecting sensitive data from ad-hoc queries. Option B still leaves the system vulnerable as the encryption key is accessible. Option D is a security risk, granting too much access to all users.

It will allow you to:\n1. Visualize the sequence of events, including JavaScript execution, DOM updates, and rendering.\n2. Identify any unexpected behavior or delays in the process.\n3. See how jQuery's internal functions interact with your custom code.\n4.

What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) A database migration error from Magento 1 to Magento 2\nB) An incompatibility between Magento 2.3.4 and the product options\nC) The max_input_vars PHP setting is too low\nD) A bug in the Magento\\Catalog\\Controller\\Adminhtml\\Product\\Validate\\Interceptor\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) While the database has gone through migration, this is unlikely to be the direct cause of the validation error, especially since some products with fewer options can be saved successfully.\n\nB) Magento 2.3.4 supports custom product options, so an inherent incompatibility is unlikely. The issue occurs only with a high number of options, suggesting a limit rather than incompatibility.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The max_input_vars PHP setting limits the number of input variables that can be processed in a single request. When dealing with many product options (each with multiple values), this limit can be exceeded, causing the validation to fail. This setting was mentioned as the solution in the \"GOOD GRIEF\" comment, indicating it's a common oversight that can cause this type of issue.\n\nD) While the error message mentions an interceptor, this is likely just where the error is being caught and reported, not the root cause of the problem.\n\nThe key clue is that the error occurs only when exceeding a certain number of options and values, pointing to a server-side limit rather than a code-specific issue."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/14", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/24738179", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3837156/"], "docs_id": 24738179, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is only for IE.\nI have a function noted below it copies the content of the div when the div is clicked.
