However I would need to use a bulk tool if possible as there are several hundred points and would take too long to do manually. \n\nI wondered whether the LRS tool in QGIS could be used to derive chainage? \n\nI am using QGIS 2\\.2, GRASS \\& Postgis. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use the QGIS [plugin LRS](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/lrs/) for that. It accepts points not lying on the line, so you avoid the first step (snapping points to lines).\n\nThis is the workflow:\n\n1. Based on both a line (routes) and a point (for calibration) layer, go to the **Calibration** tab. \n\n\t* Select the line (pipeline) layer with its *route* field (a field that identifies routes, it's very useful if your line layer has several routes).\n\t* Select the calibration point layer with its corresponding *route* (point *route* value should match with the line *route* value) and *measure* fields. As you can see, you would need a calibration point layer with at least two points, which could be located at the start and the end of the route, with values of 0 and 10000 in case that the route has 10km.![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5K9dA.png)\n\n\t* Click on Ok to interpolate M values along the routes.\n2. Go to the **Measures** tab. \n\n\t* Select your valves layer.\n\t* Fill the output fields (They'll be applied to a new layer, don't worry).\n\t* Click on Ok to get a new (memory) layer which will contain the M value (chainage) of each valve.\n3. Don't forget to save the layer you obtain from 2\\., since it's a memory (temporal) layer.\n\n---\n\nIn the following screenshot you can see a sample pipeline, a couple of calibration points (orange triangles), and a couple of valves not lying on the pipeline (green points) with their calculated chainage (M value).\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwIRH.png)\n\nYou can even verify the chainage of the valves by using the **Locate** tab. Just select your route and enter a known measure (e.g., 5603\\). You should see a yellow mark on the line, representing the projection of the valve on the line.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAPRi.png)\n\nI use QGIS v.2\\.6\\.1\\.

You have a line layer representing the pipeline and a points layer representing valves. You need to calculate the chainage (linear referencing) of the valves along the pipeline. Which of the following workflows would be the most efficient method to accomplish this task in QGIS?\n\nA) Manually snap each valve point to the pipeline, then use the Field Calculator to compute the chainage.\n\nB) Use the LRS plugin's Calibration tab to interpolate M values along the routes, then use the Measures tab to calculate chainage for valve points, even if they don't lie directly on the line.\n\nC) Create a new point layer by intersecting the valve points with the pipeline, then use the $length function in the Field Calculator to compute chainage.\n\nD) Use the GRASS v.distance tool to find the nearest point on the line for each valve, then use the v.to.db module to calculate the distance along the line.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and accurate method for this task. The LRS (Linear Referencing System) plugin in QGIS is specifically designed for this purpose and offers several advantages:\n\n1. It doesn't require the valve points to be exactly on the pipeline, eliminating the need for a separate snapping step.\n2. It can handle multiple routes within a single line layer.\n3. It uses calibration points to accurately measure distances along the line.\n4. The process can be done in bulk, which is essential when dealing with hundreds of points.\n5. It provides additional functionalities like verification through the Locate tab.\n\nOption A is inefficient as it requires manual snapping of each point, which would be time-consuming for hundreds of points.\n\nOption C might work but would require creating a new layer and may not be as accurate for points not directly on the line.\n\nOption D uses GRASS tools which could be complex to set up and may not provide the same level of accuracy and functionality as the LRS plugin."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/19", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22961", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/11689/"], "docs_id": 22961, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to make a full static copy of a Wordpress website with `wget` to be browsed without any network connection (all links and images must be converted).\n\nThe different requisites for the pages (images, css, js, ...) are on 3 different Wordpress hosts and are always on the same `wp-content/uploads` directories.\n\nI tried to limit the recursion on the other domains to `wp-content/uploads` directories with `--domains` and `--include-directories`, but I can't limit `wget` to fetch only these directories on the `$URL1` and `$URL2`.\n\nHere is the command line (which don't limit to `$URL0` and `[$URL1|$URL2]/wp-content/uploads` ) :\n\n```\nwget --convert-links --recursive -l inf -N -e robots=off -R -nc \n--default-page=index.html -E -D$URL1,$URL2,$URL0 --page-requisites \n-B$URL0 -X$URL1,$URL2 --cut-dirs=1 -I*/wp-content/uploads/*, -H -F $URL0\n\n```\n\nIs there any possibility to limit `wget`'s recursion on the other domains to only some directories?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\nwget --mirror --convert-links yourdomain.com\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to create a full static copy of a WordPress website for offline browsing.

The meteorite's apparent path will differ depending on the observer's location on Earth, due to the planet's rotation. This is because:\n\n1. In a non-rotating frame of reference (like space), the meteorite would fall in a straight line towards Earth's center.\n\n2. However, observers on Earth are in a rotating frame of reference due to the planet's rotation.\n\n3. The Coriolis effect is not a real force acting on the meteorite, but rather an apparent effect observed from the rotating frame of Earth.\n\n4. Depending on where the observer is located on Earth (e.g., near the equator vs. near the poles), the perceived path of the meteorite will appear different due to the varying effects of Earth's rotation at different latitudes.\n\nA is incorrect because the apparent curve will vary based on location.

When `anacron` is invoked (which can happen at boot time, and also during predefined hours of the day), it will read a list of jobs from the `/etc/anacrontab` configuration file. For each job, `anacron` checks if the job has been executed in last n days. For a daily job, this will be the last 1 day, i.e. today. If the job has not been run in this period, anacron executes the job.\n\nOnce the job runs to completion, `anacron` records the date of execution in a file, under `/var/spool/anacron`. This file is used to check the job's status when anacron is invoked the next day.\n\nSince `anacron` only looks at the days elapsed since last execution and the configured frequency of execution, there is no problem of a job being executed multiple times.\n\nA daily anacron job can be set up in the `/etc/anacrontab` configuration file using the following syntax:\n\n```\n1 15 backup-job /path/to/backup/script.sh\n\n```\n\n1 is the frequency of executing the command specified in days, 15 is a delay in minutes added to the execution of the job, 'backup\\-job' is an identifier, and '/path/to/backup/script.sh' is the command to be executed. You can take a look at [`man 8 anacron`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/anacron) and [`man 5 anacrontab`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/anacrontab) for more details."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator sets up a daily backup job using anacron with the following entry in /etc/anacrontab:\n\n1 15 daily-backup /usr/local/bin/backup.sh\n\nThe system is then powered off for 3 days. What happens when the system is powered on again on the 4th day?\n\nA) The backup job runs 3 times to make up for the missed days\nB) The backup job runs once immediately when the system boots\nC) The backup job runs once after a 15-minute delay\nD) The backup job doesn't run at all until the next scheduled time\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When using anacron, jobs are executed based on the number of days that have passed since the last execution, not the number of missed executions. In this case:\n\n- The \"1\" indicates it's a daily job\n- \"15\" is the delay in minutes before execution\n- When the system comes back online after 3 days, anacron will detect that the job hasn't run in more than 1 day\n- It will schedule the job to run once, after the specified 15-minute delay\n- Anacron doesn't run missed jobs multiple times, so it won't execute 3 times for the 3 missed days\n- The job doesn't run immediately on boot due to the 15-minute delay\n- The job will run, rather than waiting for the next scheduled time, because it's overdue\n\nThis question tests understanding of anacron's behavior with missed executions and delayed start times."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/144986", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/66446/"], "docs_id": 144986, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had a system running 10\\.04, I think.

The case $\\\\sigma\\=0$ is a borderline one that I am not too sure how to deal with. I assume below that $\\\\sigma\\\\neq 0$ (but I guess $\\\\sigma$ is the propagation speed of the wave, so it should be OK to discard stationary waves).\n\nThe starting point is to rewrite $w''\\+\\\\sigma w'\\+f(w)\\=0$ as\n$$\n(e^{\\\\sigma t}w')'\\=\\-e^{\\\\sigma t}f(w).\\\\hspace{2cm}(E)\n$$\n\n**Step 1**\nThe first thing you need to show is that $w\\_{\\\\pm}$ are necessarily steady\\-states, i\\-e $f(w\\_{\\\\pm})\\=0$ (stationary equilibrium solutions of the ODE, usually one is stable while the other is unstable). In order to see this assume by contradiction that $f(w\\_\\+)\\\\neq 0$ (again, it is enough to look at $t\\\\to\\+\\\\infty$).\n\n* If $\\\\sigma\\>0$ then by (E) we have $(e^{\\\\sigma t}w')'\\\\sim Ce^{\\\\sigma t}$ not integrable when $t\\\\to\\\\infty$, so $e^{\\\\sigma t}w'\\\\sim C\\\\int e^{\\\\sigma t}\\=Ce^{\\\\sigma t}$ hence $w'\\\\sim C\\\\neq 0$. This shows that $w$ blows\\-up linearly and contradicts $w(\\\\infty)\\=w\\_\\+$.\n* If now $\\\\sigma\\<0$ then $(e^{\\\\sigma t}w')'\\\\sim Ce^{\\\\sigma t}$ becomes integrable, and thus $e^{\\\\sigma t}w'\\\\to C$ for some limit $C\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. If $C\\\\neq 0$ then $w'\\\\sim Ce^{\\-\\\\sigma t}$ blows exponentially, which contradicts again $w(\\\\infty)\\=w\\_\\+$. Thus $C\\=0$, and integrating $(e^{\\\\sigma t}w')'\\\\sim Ce^{\\\\sigma t}$ from $t$ to $\\\\infty$ you get $e^{\\\\sigma t}w'\\-0\\\\sim C(e^{\\\\sigma t}\\-0\\)$, hence again linear blow\\-up $w'\\\\sim C\\\\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 2**\nOnce you know that $f(w)\\\\to f(w\\_\\+)\\=0$ (here I am definitely using the continuity of $f$) the heuristic idea is quite simple: the initial ODE $w''\\+\\\\sigma w\\+f(w)\\=0$ roughly becomes a 1st order linear ODE in $v\\=w'$\n\\\\begin{equation}\nv'\\+\\\\sigma v\\=\\-f(w)\\\\approx \\-f(w\\_\\+)\\= 0,\\\\qquad v\\=w'.\\\\hspace{2cm}(E')\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nThis linear ODE $v'\\+\\\\sigma v\\=0$ gives either the trivial solution $v'\\=v\\=0$ (which means precisely $w''\\=w'\\=0$), or $v'$ and $v$ proportional to $e^{\\-\\\\sigma t}$. If $\\\\sigma\\>0$ you see that both the trivial and exponential cases are admissible and lead to $v',v\\=w'',w'\\\\to 0$ when $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. If now $\\\\sigma\\<0$ the exponential blow\\-up $v\\=w'\\\\sim e^{\\-\\\\sigma t}$ is excluded because you assume $w(t)\\\\to w^\\+\\=cst$, so the only possibility is again $w'',w'\\=u',u\\=0$.\n\nOf course this step 2 is only formal, and rigorously justifying (E') from (E) requires tedious and technical computations similar to those in step 1\\. For that you may want to use again (E) with now $f(w)\\\\to f(w\\_\\+)\\=0$ hence\n$$\n(e^{\\\\sigma t}w')'\\=o\\\\left(e^{\\\\sigma t}\\\\right),\n$$\nand distinguish again integrability or linear/exponential blowup at infinity as in step 1\\.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a function w(t) that satisfies the following ordinary differential equation:\n\nw'' + \u03c3w' + f(w) = 0\n\nwhere \u03c3 is a real constant and f is a continuous bounded function.

As explained in the documentation, both w'(t) and w''(t) approach zero as t approaches \u00b1\u221e. This result holds true regardless of the value of \u03c3, including when \u03c3 = 0 (although this case wasn't explicitly covered in the given explanation).\n\nThe key points leading to this conclusion are:\n\n1. The limits w\u208a and w\u208b must be steady states of the system, meaning f(w\u208a) = f(w\u208b) = 0.\n2. As t approaches \u00b1\u221e, the ODE essentially becomes a first-order linear ODE in v = w', which has solutions that either decay to zero or grow exponentially.\n3.

That should be var1\\.1 on y.\n\nAnd again, which should I rely on? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since @mattbarstead answered question two so competently, I thought I should answer question one.\n\nYour question is \"should I trust my Bayesian or my Frequentist model\" and the answer is \"no.\" You should only do one or the other, but never both. This isn't because they could differ and there would be no objective way to solve your problem, but because they are not answering the same question in the first place.\n\nA couple of qualifications about the two methods should be noted. Frequentist methods are *ex ante* optimal. That is to say, prior to picking up your data, there is no better way to analyze your data. This optimality is understood that if you were to cover the sample space that, on average, the solution meets some set of optimality criteria, such as unbiasedness, consistency and so forth. Bayesian methods are *ex post* optimal. That is they only become optimal models after they have seen the data and the solutions are specifically unique to the sample seen. There is no way to extract more information about the location of a parameter than a Bayesian method. That said, the specific Bayesian result from one sample could be a poor solution when seen over the whole sample space, but the averaging rules of Frequentist methods mean using a Frequentist method could be a poor method for the sample that happened to be seen in the study.\n\nThe second is the nature of hypotheses. Frequentist hypothesis must be binary. The null here is the \"no effect\" hypothesis, that is in a broader form $\\\\mu\\=k\\=0$. This is treated as intrinsically true before it sees the data. The data may reject this, but it is assumed true. Bayesian hypotheses are combinatoric. There is nothing similar to the hypothesis that $\\\\mu\\=k$ because if your solution is in the real numbers then $\\\\Pr(\\\\mu\\=k)\\\\equiv{0}$. Just because zero is in the Bayesian credible interval does not mean that $\\\\mu\\=k.$ It is just one of an infinite number of possible solutions.\n\nYou should be choosing a Frequentist method because you have an existential or true/false style question that needs to be answered. This is especially true if you want to use the \"no effect\" hypothesis. There is no real Bayesian equivalent to the \"no effect\" hypothesis.\n\nYou should choose the Bayesian method when you have multiple competing models of the world. The Frequentist methodology has to jump to the Bayesian in order to do model selection through tools like the AIC or BIC, which are really stylized and constrained Bayesian summary statistics. For any one Frequentist method, an infinite number of Bayesian models exists. A t\\-test covers an unbelievably wide set of possible solutions that are different and distinct when constructed as a Bayesian problem. The t\\-test just depends upon how the sample was collected, whereas the Bayesian posterior depends upon how the likelihood is constructed. This implies that the Bayesian depends upon how you model the laws of the universe. It is built on modeling. The Frequentist is an algorithm based on the sampling rules.\n\nThe second case for using Bayesian methods is when real prior knowledge exists, such as prior research where there is at least partial information on the parameters. If real prior knowledge exists then Frequentist methods are statistically inadmissible. The Bayesian solution will always stochastically dominate the Frequentist in that case.\n\nYou need to think through the question of \"what do I need to know?\" Do you need to know if these variables really do not impact the dependent variable? Do you need to discover which of many possible models of the world is the closest to the model nature uses to generate the data? The former is Frequentist, the later, Bayesian. The former permits you to make deductive statements, the latter is not considering the models you did not test and so is an incomplete form of reasoning. Because there could be models you did not think of, the Bayesian posterior is incomplete. All possible models, except the alternative hypothesis, exist in the null by its very construction.\n\nYour construction of the Bayesian model looks like a Frequentist construction. Have you considered all possible ways to combine the variables, including dropping variables?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: When deciding between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches for analyzing data with a small group-level sample size (n=5), which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Explain why the Bayesian data are hovering around the mean, interpret the effects, but then rely mainly on the Frequentist results.\n\nB) Choose either the Bayesian or Frequentist approach based on the specific research question and stick with that method throughout the analysis.\n\nC) Combine both Bayesian and Frequentist results to get a more comprehensive understanding of the data.\n\nD) Always prefer the Frequentist approach when dealing with small sample sizes at the group level.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to choose either the Bayesian or Frequentist method based on the specific research question and stick with that method throughout the analysis. This is because Bayesian and Frequentist approaches are fundamentally different and answer different types of questions. Frequentist methods are suitable for binary, \"true/false\" style questions, especially when testing a \"no effect\" hypothesis. Bayesian methods are more appropriate when comparing multiple competing models or when incorporating prior knowledge. Mixing the two approaches or arbitrarily preferring one over the other regardless of the research question can lead to inconsistent or inappropriate interpretations of the data."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/13", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/159902", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/34532/"], "docs_id": 159902, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have WAMP installed on Windows 7 Home Premium\n\nI am trying to install my Joomla Component locally on windows 7 but keep getting Permission errors.\n\n> Warning: file\\_put\\_contents(C:\\\\PHP\\\\workspace\\-php\\\\Joomla\\_1\\.5\\.9\\\\tmp\\\\install\\_4c3c49163508c) \\[function.file\\-put\\-contents]: failed to open stream: Permission denied\n\nNow I tried to change to change the permissions of the folder but this didn't seem to make any difference.\n\nCan someone give me a rundown of how to change permissions in Windows 7 so that a PHP file has full control on a folder and it's subfolders?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you don't see permissions at all in explorer go \"Tools\"\\-\\>\"Folder Options\"\\-\\>\"View\"\\-\\> scroll to the bottom in the advanced settings box and uncheck \"Use Sharing Wizard(Recommended)\".\n\nSomething to try is when you click on the folder and pull up the properties about half way down it says \"Edit...\".

There is a wide variety of heuristics that compute partitions of the node set into parts (the communities) such that there are many links within the parts and only few between them (which is quantified by a variety of quality functions). One of the most famous such heuristics is the [Louvain algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method) to optimize [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)) ([and other quality functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2518)) of obtained partitions. It is very fast and performs very well in practice.\n\nCommunity detection may be used to quickly obtain very good graph embeddings, as shown in this recent paper: *[LouvainNE: Hierarchical Louvain Method for High Quality and Scalable Network Embedding](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02999888)* by Ayan Kumar Bhowmick, Koushik Meneni, Maximilien Danisch, Jean\\-Loup Guillaume, and Bivas Mitra, in WSDM 2020\\.\n\nIn another stream of works, it was shown that [Louvain finds partitions of high modularity even in random graphs that do not have communities](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/the-power-of-consensus-random-graphs-have-no-communities/). However, different runs of (a randomized version) of Louvain give very different partitions for such graphs. Instead, [the partitions obtained for networks with actual community structure are very stable](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/stable-community-cores-in-complex-networks/), which shows that instability of Louvain is specific to random graphs.\n\nIn the absence of a more direct solution, this may be seen as a promising direction to ''show that random graphs cannot be embedded with short edges'', IMHO. Indeed, it seems to me that the instability of Louvain (and other) methods on random graphs means that the obtained partitions make little sense, as one may expect. In turn, this means that embeddings of such random graphs, at least using Louvain\\-based approaches, probably have little sense too. They would therefore result in large values of your $\\\\gamma$ property, and this would, in a sense, be specific to random graphs (or, at least, graphs with no community structure).

I have found that after a few thousand bounces, it converges on \"rolling\" behavior; that is, the bounces get shorter and shorter and it essentially sticks to the surface. The simulation basically can't progress beyond this point as a result. Below is the part of the trajectory that illustrates this behavior; the trajectory goes from chaotic to convergent along the surface of the torus:\n\n[![trajectory](https://i.stack.imgur.com/828zu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/828zu.png)\n\nOn the left can be seen the discrete bounces, and on the right is where the particle sticks to the surface (until program termination).\nIt seems counter\\-intuitive that a the trajectory could become trapped like this after demonstrating chaotic behavior for thousands of prior bounces. Closer examination reveals that the angles become more and more grazing with each bounce, and the distances between bounces shorter, until no progress can be made.\n\nIf I had infinite numerical precision to peek past this event horizon, would I eventually find that the particle breaks free again? Or is it possible that this is also a theoretical limit, and the motion of the particle has transitioned from finite segments to a continuous curve constrained to the surface?

The `for` loop iterates over all matching files, using the (N) glob qualifier to avoid errors if no files match.\n3. It splits each filename into parts using `${(s[_])file}`.\n4.

This 1M\u03a9 combination is then in parallel with another 1M\u03a9 resistor (R3), resulting in a total resistance of about 500k\u03a9. \n\nIn Circuit 2, all three resistors are in parallel. The two 1M\u03a9 resistors (R2 and R3) become negligible compared to the 1\u03a9 resistor (R1), as current will predominantly flow through the path of least resistance. This results in a total resistance very close to 1\u03a9.\n\nTherefore, Circuit 1's total resistance (about 500k\u03a9) is significantly higher than Circuit 2's (about 1\u03a9), making option C the correct answer."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/08", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/409872", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/208831/"], "docs_id": 409872, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a large iOS application, I have a database module which is dedicated to handle application databases with read/write public APIs for other module. UI module has a feature to share the database, in which a copy of the database can be sent to another person. Now to attach my database for share feature UI module requires my database path. So, UI team requested to expose a public API to get the database path.\n\nI am concern about security perspective of exposing database path as a public API. What are the general guideline to share the database for other modules? Should I expose my database path via public API? If so, is there any implication on further security vulnerability and does it violate the abstraction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a security perspective, the risks involved with exposing a database path/connection string to other modules in the same application, where those modules are developed by the same organisation, are low. It would take at least a bug in another component to expose the database path outside the application, but all those components can be vetted for improper use of this API.  \n\nAdditionally, given the feature that asks for it, the database contents are probably not all that sensitive anyway.\n\nFrom a design perspective, there are only a few reasons to expose the database path outside the component that deals with the database:\n\n* configuration: It might be that the database path is read from a configuration file which is handled by a configuration module\n* To show/edit by the user: There might be a feature whereby the user can see and/or change the database path. This could be coupled with the configuration mentioned before.\n\nThis database sharing feature appears to fit none of those reasons, so there should not be a reason to expose the database path for it. But, the iOS API use to do the actual sharing may need to receive the name of a file that gets shared. In that case, there are only two ways to implement the feature: you either pass that API the path to your actual database file, or the application copies the database contents into a new file.\n\nTo keep the separation of responsibilities between the components clear, I would go for a design like this:\n\n* the database module offers an API to get the name of a file with the database contents in a format suitable for sharing\n* the UI module can use that API to implement their part of the sharing feature\n* the database module implements the API by either providing the actual database path, or by copying the database content to a file.

Maintains the separation of concerns between modules\n2. Doesn't expose the actual database path, addressing potential security concerns\n3. Provides the necessary functionality for the sharing feature\n4. Allows the database module to control how the shareable data is prepared (e.g., copying to a new file or using the actual database file)\n5.

If the target value is greater than the middle element, the left half of the list is eliminated from the search space, and the search continues in the right half. If the target value is less than the middle value, the right half is eliminated from the search space, and the search continues in the left half. This process is repeated until the middle element is equal to the target value, or if the algorithm returns that the element is not in the list at all.\n\nIn a standard binary search, using an array with alphanumeric elements, the elements are first sorted. But in terms of troubleshooting hardware, the idea of \"sorting an element\" is somewhat meaningless and unnecessary. Also, a binary search works on exactly half of an array during each iteration\u2014something which will likely not be the case with hardware troubleshooting.\n\nThe general approach is the same, however. You eliminate variables from the overall field of possibilities, then continue to apply the same process to the remaining variables until the culprit is identified.\n\nThe term \"divide and conquer\" is applicable, because you are dividing hardware components into groups\u2014and then eliminating all suspect components in one group or the other *en masse*.\n\nWhat you're doing is not *actually* a **binary search**, but it carries the same general meaning."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In hardware troubleshooting, an engineer uses a method where they systematically test different components, measure performance after each change, and narrow down the problem area.

The troubleshooting method described is conceptually similar to a binary search algorithm, although not identical. Here's why:\n\n1. Binary search: This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating one half at each step until the target is found or determined to be absent.\n\n2. The hardware troubleshooting method follows a similar principle:\n   - It starts with the whole system (like the full array in binary search).\n   - It modifies a part of the system (analogous to checking the middle element).\n   - Based on the result, it narrows down the search to a smaller subset of components.\n   - This process is repeated until the issue is identified.\n\n3. While not an exact binary search (as hardware components can't be \"sorted\" like array elements), the general approach of systematically eliminating possibilities and narrowing the search space is conceptually similar.\n\nA) Depth-first search is incorrect because it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which doesn't match the described method.\n\nC) Breadth-first search is incorrect as it explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level, unlike the described method.\n\nD) Linear search is incorrect because it checks every element sequentially without eliminating large portions of the search space at once, which is unlike the efficient narrowing down process described."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/09/03", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/134627", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/44101/"], "docs_id": 134627, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm creating a new Magento 2 theme.\n\nI've needed to add custom CSS to I'd created 2 CSS files **local\\-l.css** and **local\\-n.css** in this location:\n\n```\napp/design/frontend/myvendor/mytheme/Magento_Theme/web/css\n\n```\n\nin order to test some CSS I've added this to both CSS files:\n\n```\nbody {\n    background-color: red;\n}\n\n```\n\nalso I've added this:\n\n```\n<css src=\"css/local-m.css\" />\n<css src=\"css/local-l.css\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 768px)\"/>\n\n```\n\nto \n\n```\ndefault_head_blocks.xml\n\n```\n\nand then run this:\n\n```\nphp bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy\n\n```\n\nalso, the cache is all disabled from the backend.\n\nI'm a theory, my page should be red but nothing is happening.\n\nWhat I'm I doing wrong and how can I fix this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your css path wrong it should be `app/design/frontend/myvendor/mytheme/web/css` take reference from `<root>/vendor/magento/theme-frontend-luma/web`. \n\nIf you need to include in module, you need to mention module in CSS path\n\n```\n<css src=\"Vendor_Module::css/style.css\" />\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a new Magento 2 theme and need to add custom CSS files.

Some of these were covered in the comments.\n\n* Reduce the TTL of the DNS record, several days before the move. Perform the move and then you can restore the TTL to its previous value. This does not guarantee all DNS servers in the world will have updated. You may still have some users operating off a stale DNS record. But that's what you get with DNS. It's generally good. But no guarantee. You can't even really verify as you would have to check all DNS servers of the world, many will be doing caching, some won't respect TTLs. But in generally, this is a pretty safe way to do it. Unless you have 10 million users or more, I think the potential risk is relatively low, that one of your users will be using a broken DNS server.\n* Update both servers with the latest version, then it does not matter. Say A is currently the server pointed to by DNS, update B, change DNS, update A. There is a small possible problem window during the update of A where a user will get a broken site.\n* Put a load balancer in front, which takes over the IP address DNS currently points to. This is a more complex change to your existing setup but is more how things should be generally.\n* Quickly swap the IP addresses. Give Server B the IP address of Server A and change Server A. Very short downtime \\- a couple seconds if you are ready with a script. No risks of having stale DNS since you don't change DNS.\n* Use Keepalived or similar tool. The DNS then points to a floating IP address. The server which currently has that IP would need to be given a different IP address. This is a higher complexity level than most other solutions, but it is a great improvement to your set up. Right now, you are at risk. DNS has a \"long\" TTL for the A record pointing to Server A. If Server A fails, you have to change the DNS to point to Server B which will take a long time to propagate. With a floating IP, then you never have to change the DNS. If Server A fails, Server B automatically takes over after a few milliseconds the floating IP and everything keeps on working.\n* Update Server B with new code. Switch the configuration on Server A so that instead of serving the web site, the web server proxy the requests to Server B. (Easy if its Apache httpd, NGINX, IIS. Many others should be able to do that, if not, you could put HAProxy, quickly stop the web server and start HAProxy.) At this point, all the requests are handled by Server B on the new code.

The support should let the ad carry get ALL the creeps. If the ad carry is not present the support should not push BUT it can last hit and get a couple minions if the turret would kill them anyway. But the general idea is to facilitate your carry to farm more, so even if the carry is back at a moment you shouldn't push the lane by farming.\n\n***2***\n\nIts ok to kill neutral creeps when the jungler is somewhere far away. Actually it's a well known tactic to kill the golems when they spawn at level 1, if the jungler starts at blue. Because by the time the jungler will come to the golems they will have respawned. The idea is to kill any minor camps you can if the jungler is busy somewhere else far from that camp. You don't want to steal your jungler's farm but you don't want to let those camps staying there unexploited for no reason either. \nSo you have to have good awareness of the time it takes for those camps to respawn.

I'd say around 100 creeps at the 12\\-15 minute mark would be nice but it all depends on the game. What you should do as an ad carry is try to outfarm the other ad carry and you should have more farm than anyone in the game to be honest. Thats when you know that you're doing well.

The documentation states that while around 100 creeps at the 12-15 minute mark is a good benchmark, it's not a strict rule. The key is to outfarm the enemy AD Carry and have more farm than anyone else in the game.

The claim is that thanks to \"an advanced technology\" the battery life in those watches is extended to ten years.\n\nNow if you look at different models you see that they are rather complicated hence likely energy consuming \\- for example, [AW\\-80\\-1AV model](https://www.casio.com/products/watches/sports/aw80-1av) has both a liquid crystal display and hands and also it has LED illumination and a sound alarm.\n\nI first thought that maybe the battery is the key. Model AW\\-80\\-1AV runs on CR2025\\. Energizer CR2025 datasheet specifies that this battery has nominal output voltage of 3 volts and nominal capacity of 163 mAh, so it stores 0,489 volt\\-ampere\\-hours of energy.\n\nFor comparison, typical basic model of Swatch run about three years on Renata silver oxide 390 (SR1130SW) battery that has nominal output voltage of 1,55 volts and nominal capacity of 60 mAh and so stores 0,093 volt\\-ampere\\-hours of energy.\n\nSo CR2025 stores about five times more energy, but the basic model of Swatch only has hands \\- no digital display, no illumination, no alarm, so it likely consumes less energy.\n\nThere clearly must be something more than a bigger battery that makes 10 years battery life possible.\n\nHow is 10 years battery life possible in a rather energy consuming wristwatch?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 10 years \\=\\~ 87650 hours.  \n\n 1 uA drain will require 87\\.75 mAh in 10 years.  \n\n With som shelf life degradation that's close enough to  \n\n \\= 10 mAh / uA / year or  \n\n \\= 100 mAh / uA / 10 years \n\nSo your cited 163 mAh battery will supply 1\\.63 uA mean.  \n\n Pushing technology, size and luck may get you to say 5 uA mean.\n\nThere are 86400 seconds/day. \nThere are 1440 minutes/day.\n\nYou will find that eg alarm use is much restricted in the allowable use to get 10 years. If 1 uA of the drain is for alarm use then you get 24 uA.hr/day or 86400 uA.seconds or 86 mA.seconds. That's about 240 mW seconds at 3 V. Or say 5 x 50 mW x 1 second burst/day.\n\nAn LED can provide ample lighting at 1 mA. Use it 5 times/day x 1 second \\= 5 mA.sec \\= 5000 uA.sec or \"only\" 5000/86400 \\= 0\\.06 uA mean drain.

Nevertheless I am also interested in the answer.\n\nThe question concerns relationships between Hilbert's 10th Problem (over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ and over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$) and the **Equations Problem** (EP) in certain groups. The EP in a group $G$ is (apparently; I am not an expert here) to algorithmically decide whether an equation with parameters in a group has a solution. In other words, let $G$ be a countably infinite group and let $\\\\{g\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}$ be an enumeration of the elements of $G$. An **equation** in $G$ is a word in the $g\\_i$'s and in some formal variables $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_N$ and their inverses, which is set equal to $1$. The EP is whether there is an algorithm which upon being given an equation, decides whether the equation has a solution in $G$, i.e., whether we can evaluate the indetermines to elements of $G$ so as to get a true identity. (Maybe this depends on the enumeration of the elements of $G$. If $G$ has a solvable word problem \\-\\- which I think is true for the groups which are coming \\-\\- then it shouldn't matter.)\n\n**Added**: It seems I didn't get the formalism right. Let's restrict to finitely presented groups with solvable word problem, and enumerate the elements as distinct words in the generators with respect to some reasonable lexicographic ordering. Or, if you like, part of the question is to ask exactly what EP means in this context: certainly it means something, as it has been studied by many people.\n\nMore formally, in the language of groups augmented by a constant for each element $g\\_i$ of $G$, the EP is asking whether the *positive existential theory* of $G$ is decidable.\n\nThe questions concern a much\\-cited 1979 paper of Romankov:\n\n---\n\nRoman\u02b9kov, V. A.\nUniversal theory of nilpotent groups. (Russian)\nMat. Zametki 25 (1979\\), no. 4, 487\u2013495, 635\\. \n\n---\n\nA feature of the situation is that I haven't been able to get my hands on the entire paper, so but here is the MathReview by O.V. Belegradek:\n\n> A finitely generated nilpotent group has a decidable theory if and only if it is abelian\\-by\\-finite \\[Ju. L. Er\u0161ov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 203 (1972\\), 1240\u20131243; MR0297840 (45 \\#6892\\)]. The author gives an example of a finitely generated 4\\-step nilpotent group with undecidable universal theory. The proof depends on Matijasevi\u010d's undecidability result for the universal theory of the ring of integers. A. I. Mal\u02b9cev \\[Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 50 (92\\) (1960\\), 257\u2013266; MR0118677 (22 \\#9448\\)] showed the undecidability of the theory of a free 2\\-step nilpotent group. The author proves that the decidability of the universal part of this theory is equivalent to the decidability of the universal theory of the field of rationals. {Reviewer's remark: A. M. Slobodsko\u012d and \u00c8. I. Fridman \\[5th All\\-Union Conference on Mathematical Logic, p. 140, Akad. Nauk SSSR Sibirsk. Otdel., Inst. Mat., Novosibirsk, 1979] have announced the decidability of the universal theory of the field of rationals.}\n\n**First Question**: There are many free $2$\\-step nilpotent groups: one such group, call it $N(2,m)$ for each rank $m \\\\geq 1$. Thus e.g. $N(2,2\\)$ is the standard Heisenberg group over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. Which group(s) does Romankov's decidability result refer to? \n\nMy guess on this: it should refer to $N(2,\\\\infty)$, the free $2$\\-step nilpotent group of countably infinite rank. I also guess that it shouldn't matter much, in that the universal theories of $N(2,n)$ should be the same for all $2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq \\\\infty$: I saw very similar results in the literature with solvable groups, and it seems very plausible.\n\n**Transition to the Second Question**: There are many places in the literature where Romankov's result is characterized as: \"Solving the equations problem in a free $2$\\-step nilpotent group is equivalent to Hilbert's 10th Problem over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\" Here are some instances:\n\n[Page 1 of this arxiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.1830.pdf), which has since been published.\n\n[This 1997 paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2275737)\n\nIn the MathScinet reivew of a 1995 paper: MR1351615\\. The reviewer is Romankov.\n\nBut now I'm a little confused. Hilbert's 10th problem (over any ring) concerns the positive existential theory of that ring: it's about whether solutions exist to polynomial equations. Similarly for the EP. If we could omit the word \"positive\" then, sure, the full existential theory of any structure is decidable iff the full universal theory is, since \n\n$\\\\exists x P(x)$ is true exactly when $\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\neg P(x)$ is false.\n\nSo let's define E/IP to be the group theory problem with equations or inequations. So it seems to me that Romankov's result is rather that decidability of E/IP for $N(2,\\\\infty)$ (and so perhaps also for $N(2,2\\)$ is my guess at Q1 is correct) is equivalent to the decidability of all polynomial equations *and inequations* over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$. It seems to me though that \"H10 over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$\" concerns equations only, so I wonder whether these inequations are actually necessary.\n\nThis question is equivalent to the definability of the set $R^{\\\\bullet} \\= R \\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}$ by a positive existential formula. Over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ this is well known to be the case: via Lagrange's Theorem that set is defined by \n\n$\\\\{y \\\\mid \\\\exists x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3,x\\_4 \\\\ x\\_1^2 \\+ x\\_2^2 \\+ x\\_3^2 \\+ x\\_4^2 \\+1\\= y^2\\\\}$\n\nI found in a survey article of T. Pheidas that for $R \\= \\\\mathbb{C}\\[\\[t]]$, $R^{\\\\bullet}$ is *not* positively existentially definable. But what about over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$?\n\n**Second Question**: Is it really true that EP for $H(2,2\\)$ is equivalent to H10/$\\\\mathbb{Q}$? Or just that E/IP is equivalent to the undecidability of polynomial equations and inequations over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more of a comment than an answer, since I want to engage only with some of the issues you mention at the very beginning of your post. I believe that you need to take more care in formulating the Equations Problem. \n\nSpecifically, I claim that with your way of describing the equations problem, *every* infinite group has an enumeration for which the EP is not decidable. So this property can depend on the enumeration, even when the group has another presentation with a decidable word problem. This is because we may find an enumeration $g\\_0,g\\_1,g\\_2,\\\\ldots$ of the elements of the group for which the group operation $g\\_ig\\_j\\=g\\_k$ is not decidable (equivalently, the function $(i,j)\\\\mapsto k$ is not computable). To find such an enumeration, we simply diagonalize against the possible programs that might compute the group operation: any given finite partial enumeration can be extended so as to disagree with the next program offered as a candidate for computing the operation. And if we have enumerated the group in such a way that the group operation is not computable, then we cannot decide the corresponding EP, since we cannot decide whether $x^{\\-1}x g\\_ig\\_j\\=g\\_k$ has a solution or not. \n\nThis suggests that you probably want to insist on having a computable presentation of your group, in the sense of computable model theory. So you should only consider enumerations where the group operation is computable. It follows that the inverse operation is also computable, since for any element we can search for the element that multiplies with it to the identify (a fixed parameter of the algorithm)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the Equations Problem (EP) in group theory?\n\nA) The EP is always independent of the enumeration of group elements for groups with a solvable word problem.\n\nB) For any infinite group, there exists at least one enumeration that makes the EP undecidable.\n\nC) The EP is equivalent to deciding whether a word in the group elements and variables is equal to the identity element.\n\nD) The EP requires only that the group operation be computable, not necessarily the inverse operation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Which combination of Bootstrap classes and HTML structure would best achieve this?\n\nA) Use <div class=\"card-deck\"> as the parent container and add class=\"card\" to each product card div.\n\nB) Apply class=\"d-flex flex-row\" to the parent container and class=\"flex-grow-1\" to each product card div.\n\nC) Wrap product cards in <div class=\"row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-3 row-cols-md-4 g-2\"> and use class=\"card h-100\" for each card div.\n\nD) Set a fixed height using style=\"height: 300px;\" on each product card div within a standard row and col structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct approach for creating equal-height product cards in a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap. The row-cols classes create a flexible grid system, while the h-100 class on each card ensures they expand to the full height of their container. This method allows for consistent card sizes while accommodating varying content lengths, and it's responsive across different screen sizes. Options A and B don't effectively address the equal height requirement, while option D uses a fixed height which is less flexible and responsive than the Bootstrap utility classes."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/31", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272161", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/311582/"], "docs_id": 272161, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I flag a person who is trying to earn dummy reputation?\n\nToday I have seen 2 people who are doing something along the lines of this: One is asking and the other is answering and vice versa.\n\nHow can flag this kind of activity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Flag one of the posts in question and use the 'Moderator intervention Required' reason, and add some reasoning in there.
