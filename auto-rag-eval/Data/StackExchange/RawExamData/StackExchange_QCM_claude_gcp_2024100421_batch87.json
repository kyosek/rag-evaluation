Someone just skipped the last step in drywall repair, and proceeded to paint. The wonderful thing about drywall is that when you screw up, you can generally fix it without starting over.\n\nAs another poster suggested, you just need to feather everything out, and sand. I'm not a pro drywaller, but I'd *think* you could get away with just one application of mud\\+sanding.\n\nCheck out this guy on youtube, who gives pretty good advice on drywalling techniques. I'd highly recommend youtube for something like this, as it's hard to describe drywall techniques in words or even pictures.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=BUcT5LHmA7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUcT5LHmA7w)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is trying to fix a poorly finished drywall repair on a painted wall.

And the formula for length contraction is from the stationary to the moving frame, in this case from the train to the track:\n$$L\\_0 \\= L \\\\sqrt{1\\-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nSo, the velocities are $v$ for both frames."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A train is moving at a constant velocity v relative to a stationary platform.

TeXstudio does not automatically load .cwl (completion word list) files for packages that are included within a custom document class using \\RequirePackage. When a custom class is used, TeXstudio only looks for a .cwl file matching the name of that class. It doesn't analyze the contents of the class to determine which packages are loaded.\n\nThis explains why the commands may appear unrecognized in the IDE (showing up in red and giving \"unrecognized command\" warnings), even though the document compiles correctly.

Seriously, there isn't a single program in existence that can't be written completely DIP free.\n\nWe don't use DIP to accomplish a requirement. We use DIP so that the inevitable new requirement doesn't force a massive rewrite, recompilation, and redistribution. \n\nSo, do you need DIP here?\n\nWell there isn't much code here to go by, other than it's clear that `ShowUserInfo` knows about `User`. The question then is if we care.\n\nThink about this: `User` knows about `String`. `String` is as concrete as they come. Yet no one ever throws DIP at `String`. Why? Because `String` is stable (unlikely to change). Can you say the same thing about `User`?\n\nIf `User` is volatile (likely to change) then it's dangerous for `ShowUserInfo` to know about it directly. A change to `User` requires a change to `ShowUserInfo` if there is no DIP. A more stable interface or purely abstract class (doesn't matter which) helps protect against this volatility.\n\nNow that's just about needing a more stable abstraction. DIP can actually do a little more for you.\n\nDIP lets the flow of control go against the source code dependency. That gives you even more options to isolate against change.\n\nOf `User` and `DisplayUserInfo` which do you think is more stable?\n\nThe usual pattern is to assume the business rule classes are the most stable and the reporting / adapting classes that communicate with the outside world are less so. But, if for some reason you thought `User` was less stable you could use DIP to reverse the source code dependency so that `DisplayUserInfo` knows nothing about `User` and so is protected from its volatility. It's better to know about stable things than unstable things. What you don't know about can't hurt you.\n\nThat's the real nifty thing about those open arrows \\<\\|\\-\\- you see in UML diagrams. Flow of control goes through them backwards. That inversion of direction is where this principle gets its name. \n\nSince DIP lets you replace a uses arrow \\-\\-\\> with an implements arrow \\<\\|\\-\\- pointing the other way, you get to decide what knows about what regardless of what needs to talk to what.

Which of the following statements best describes when and why the developer should apply DIP in this scenario?\n\nA) The developer should always create an interface for User to strictly adhere to DIP, regardless of the system's current needs or future plans.\n\nB) The developer should only create an interface if there are immediate plans to implement multiple types of User objects for polymorphism.\n\nC) The developer should create an interface if User is likely to be volatile (subject to change) and ShowUserInfo needs protection from these potential changes.\n\nD) The developer should not create an interface because User depends on String, which is concrete, so applying DIP is unnecessary in this case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C because it aligns with the core purpose of the Dependency Inversion Principle as explained in the documentation. DIP is primarily about managing change and protecting against volatility. If User is likely to change frequently, creating an interface would help isolate ShowUserInfo from these changes, reducing the need for extensive rewrites when User is modified.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because blindly applying DIP without considering the specific needs of the system is not the best practice. DIP should be applied thoughtfully where it provides tangible benefits.\n\nAnswer B is too limiting. While polymorphism can be a reason to use interfaces, DIP is more about managing dependencies and change than just enabling polymorphism.\n\nAnswer D misunderstands the principle. The fact that User depends on String is irrelevant to whether ShowUserInfo should depend on an abstraction of User. String is stable and unlikely to change, which is why it doesn't need to be abstracted. The same may not be true for User."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/16", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2146442", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/416812/"], "docs_id": 2146442, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can someone help me to find the basis for $(1\\-y\\-z,y,z)$ please?\n\nI have $(\\-1,1,0\\)$ and $(\\-1,0,1\\)$, but I don't know how to add $1$ to $x$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am assuming you mean the subspace spanned by the vector $$\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\-y\\-z \\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\ z\\\\end{pmatrix},$$ where $y,z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNote that vector is really just \n\n$$\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\-y\\-z \\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\ z\\\\end{pmatrix}\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{pmatrix}\\+\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\-1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{pmatrix}y\\+\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\-1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{pmatrix}z.$$\n\nIf you take $y\\=z\\=0$, you have the vector $\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{pmatrix}$, which is in this subspace, and linearly independent of the other two vectors you found.

Once you have a complete set of legendary gear, no matter how bad, you can handle torment 1 no problem.\n2. Complete a class set.

I typically use the kanai's cube to upgrade rare weapons into legendaries for the specific one I need. Also, completing the focus and restraint ring set is usually a huge damage boost.\n4. Collect some Legendary gems. Even level 1 gems can be a huge boost in damage if you pick the right ones (bane of trapped, zei's vengeance, bane of powerful, etc).\n5.

Once you are using your class's best set and have the right legendary gear in every slot, you should be easily T10 capable at this point.

According to the documentation, the most effective early-game strategy is to first fill every slot with legendary items, even if they're not optimal.

Yours is missing `\\documentclass` as well as `\\begin` and `\\end` document. It is also missing the loading of `xcolor` (for the color names like `gray!25`) and `rotating` (for the `sideways` environment). To color the whole multirow you need to color all three cells of it. Also, your use of `\\multirow` is incorrect. If you want to put the text into the cells above it, the number should be negative. If you do that, you don't need the optional adjustments of `[7mm]` nor the `\\qquad`s.

I am familiar with conducting meta\\-analyses and will be undertaking my calculations in R (using the `metafor` and `lme4` packages). To provide greater context, the studies in question ask research subjects to make a binary decision with respect to a personal preference across one of two conditions. In some cases, each participant is assigned to a single condition (making only a single binary response); in others, each subject takes part in both conditions (making two binary responses). For now, presume I have the raw data in all cases. The issue I face is how best to calculate an OR that is comparable across design and whether I should take the correlation between conditions into account for the within\\-subject designs.\n\n**My Current Approach**\n\nI presently use logistic regression to estimate the OR for between\\-subject designs. The slope represents the OR and the sampling variance can be calculated by squaring the SE of the slope coefficient. Using this approach produces estimates comparable to equations reported in common texts such The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta\\-Analysis, 2nd Edition (p. 243\\). I then extend this approach to use a multilevel logistic regression model including a random intercept by subject to estimate the OR for within\\-subject designs while account for the dependency between conditions. The OR and sampling variance are otherwise calculated in the same fashion. \n\n**My Questions:**\n\nWith this in mind, I would like to ask:\n\n1. Is it reasonable to meta\\-analytically aggregate OR calculated using standard and multilevel logistic regression?\n2. Would it be better to use standard logistic regression for both designs (ignoring the correlation between conditions for the within\\-subject designs)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll focus in my answer purely on the question on how to compute a (log) OR based on a within\\-subjects design that is comparable to that from a between\\-subjects design.\n\nSuppose you have a within\\-subjects design with these data:\n\n```\n                                condition2\n                         decision1   decision2   total\ncondition1   decision1   s           t           a\n             decision2   u           v           b\n             total       c           d           n\n\n```\n\nNote that this is the 'paired\\-subjects' 2x2 table based on `n` subjects. This table can be rearranged into a 'between\\-subjects' 2x2 table:\n\n```\n             decision1   decision2   total\ncondition1   a           b           n\ncondition2   c           d           n\n\n```\n\nThen you can compute what is often called the \"marginal OR\" with the usual equation for computing an odds ratio with:\n\n$$OR \\= \\\\frac{ad}{bc}$$\n\nAnd for meta\\-analytic purposes, we usually work with the log(OR), so just take the log of that. This value is then comparable to that obtained from a between\\-subjects design.\n\nHowever, note that the same `n` subjects are used to compute the cell entries under `condition1` and `condition2`, so the data are not independent. This needs to be taken into consideration when computing the sampling variance of the marginal log odds ratio. Based on Becker and Balagtas (1993\\) (see also: Elbourne et al., 2002, and Stedman et al., 2011\\), we can compute (or to be precise: estimate) the sampling variance of the marginal log(OR) with:\n\n$$Var(log\\[OR]) \\= \\\\frac{1}{a} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{b} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{c} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{d} \\- \\\\frac{2\\\\Delta}{n},$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\\\Delta \\= n^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{ns \\- ac}{abcd}\\\\right).$$\n\n(Recall that $s$ is the upper\\-left cell count from the paired\\-subjects table.)\n\n**References**\n\nBecker, M.

(The winding number is how many times a curve goes around a marked point; the turning number is how many times its *velocity vector* goes around the origin.) The turning number equals the integral of the curvature divided by $2\\\\pi$. Second, as others noticed, $r$ should not be too large if the curvature attains negative values.

Most of my sources seem to equal unstandardized coefficients in multiple regression with the semipartial correlation of that IV with the DV. But one book says there is a slight difference:\n\nboth terms have the same enumerator, but the differ in the denominator: the semipartial correlation coefficient has a quare root in the denominator (sqr(1\\-r\u00b2), but the regression coefficient \u00df has none (1\\-r\u00b2). the author states that the more the predictors correlate, the more will the two values differ.\n\nI could not find this information anywhere else. is this a fact or what should i think of it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While thorough and ultimately correct, the comment of @ttnphns given to the question is slightly misleading in the sense that it focuses on the similarities between the standardized regression coefficient and the partial correlation, while the more obvious comparison would be between standardized regression coefficient and the more closely related *semi*partial correlation \\[but see the thoughtful answer of @ttnphns in response to my post, clarifying his point about partial correlations]. \n\nIndeed, the only difference is that the semipartial takes the square root of the denominator. The result is that the semipartial is bounded between \\-1 and \\+1, while Beta is not.\n\nAside from the algebraic similarities, semipartial correlations are also conceptually closest to regression coefficients. In a regression analysis, we try to measure the unique explanatory power of predictors, i.e. the unique part of the *total* variance of Y that can be explained by X1, controlled for the other X\\-variables. That is, we residualize each X on other predictors to get its unique effect, but we do not residualize Y, as in the partial correlation.\n\nFor an excellent Powerpoint presentation on this topic, see [these slides by Michael Brannick of the University of South Florida](http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/mbrannick/regression/19%20Partial%20and%20Semi.ppt)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In multiple regression analysis, which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2) and semipartial correlations?\n\nA) Standardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlations are algebraically identical and can be used interchangeably.\n\nB) Semipartial correlations have a square root in the denominator (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)), while standardized regression coefficients do not (1-r\u00b2), resulting in semipartial correlations being bounded between -1 and +1.\n\nC) Standardized regression coefficients are more closely related to partial correlations than to semipartial correlations in multiple regression analysis.\n\nD) The difference between standardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlations decreases as the correlations among predictors increase.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The key difference between standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2) and semipartial correlations lies in their denominators. Semipartial correlations include a square root in the denominator (\u221a(1-r\u00b2)), while standardized regression coefficients do not (1-r\u00b2). This mathematical difference results in semipartial correlations being bounded between -1 and +1, whereas standardized regression coefficients are not bounded in this way.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while similar, standardized regression coefficients and semipartial correlations are not identical and cannot be used interchangeably due to the difference in their denominators.\n\nOption C is incorrect because semipartial correlations are actually more closely related to standardized regression coefficients than partial correlations are in multiple regression analysis.

[In 2017](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/31/stack-exchange-2017-review/), we had zero new designs. We've painted ourselves into a corner and need to give our designers some space to work with.

Not so obvious right now, but a standard theme also allows us to port Stack Overflow\\-exclusive features to other sites; new features that target Stack Overflow, Enterprise or Teams will probably stay locked into those platforms as long as we don't have a common design to target. \n\nI would have liked these changes to be rolled out with the [custom question list feature](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312781/custom-question-lists-finding-questions-you-can-answer). That would have given everyone something to like about the changes other than a promise of fewer design bugs in the future. I know this state of affairs is not very satisfying.\n\nHow we get feedback\n-------------------\n\nReading the responses to [What does constructive criticism of a design change look like?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/314089/1438), it occured to me that people might not understand where meta feedback is most valuable. [Meta was started](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/28/cmon-get-meta/), in part, due to [my suggestion on UserVoice](https://web.archive.org/web/20090522110810/http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com:80/pages/1722-general/suggestions/106921-provide-an-authorized-location-for-meta-discussion-):\n\n> I know this has been declined multiple times, but I really think it's time to consider the problem of meta\\-discussions on the site.\n\nIn those day, nearly a decade ago, Stack Overflow was growing quickly and active users were an important source of ideas and feature requests. But, as you can see from the quote, most suggestions were declined. Usually they were declined with no explanation or terse pronouncements. Meta, by contrast, has turned out to be incredibly useful for working out certain types of features like [the review queue indicator](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305893/what-criteria-should-we-use-to-determine-which-review-queue-indicator-a-site-wil). It gives developers and users space to discuss the workings of the site in detail. **Reasoned arguments on meta provide feedback that can't be reproduced elsewhere.**\n\nUnfortunately, we haven't always used that space to its best advantage. Jeff has talked about this in [Listen to Your Community, But Don't Let Them Tell You What to Do](https://blog.codinghorror.com/listen-to-your-community-but-dont-let-them-tell-you-what-to-do/). In contrast to his habit of declining suggestions quickly, we've swung to the opposite extreme. Ideas languish on meta. Once in a while, we'll dig up an old idea, but more often your hard work convincing us to do something goes unanswered. That doesn't mean it lacks value, however. When I wrote that UserVoice suggestion, I just wanted to have a place for meta\\-discussions even if the company ignored them. \n\nIn the last couple of years, we've cultivated other types of feedback. For instance, the [blog post that introduced the navigation changes](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/) incorporated feedback from user interviews. From these tests, we can observe what happens when people try to use the interface. [Direct feedback as people learn](http://jericson.github.io/2016/06/30/usability_tests.html) about the changes can only be reproduced on meta if the user is very diligent to record their own experiences in detail. Even then, it'd be just one of the [\\~5 individuals](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) you need for good results. Since we do user interviews more frequently than in the past, we often have a good idea of what does or does not work in the UI before presenting it to meta.\n\nWe also use A/B tests and usage statistics. In the case of the left\\-hand sidebar, it's easy to spot when we made the change on Stack Overflow:\n\n[![Stack Overflow navigation usage](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZGOQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZGOQ.png)\n\nMeta feedback such as \"I have a hard time finding the [questions page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)\" is especially useful if the data shows this is a common problem. If your concern happens to be less common, it requires more information about what makes your use case notable. Even then, it might be impossible to fix without breaking something for others.\n\nBy the way, the other sites that have [received the new theme](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes) show a pattern unlike Stack Overflow:\n\n[![Non-SO navigation usage](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXIny.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXIny.png)\n\nSince Stack Overflow is a critical part of many programmers' workflow, we get criticism from outside the community. Traditionally, we've ignored that input because people who are not active on the sites tend not to understand how the sausage is made. Recently, however, we've [heard criticism](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52) that we've taken to heart and responded to. If you can find the truth buried within [misunderstandings of outsiders](https://twitter.com/thedimishra/status/934988697107185664) it can be useful to hear from the largely\\-silent majority of people who use the site passively.\n\nFinally, there are internal considerations such as input from other parts of the business. [Adding navigation support for Teams](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/) was a key reason we embarked on this round of changes, if you recall. We strive for transparency, but don't always succeed. Then there are trivial issues like the way our code is structured or people going on vacation or disagreements about how to do things that can have outsized effects on what we are able to do. Sometimes we fail to predict what information is most relevant. \n\nWorking with you to improve the feedback cycle\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe sense I get from reading answers and comments here is that the frustration many of you feel stems from a lack of agency over the features, design and operation of the site(s) you love. The express goal of the standard theme is to support Teams, a feature many people will never get to use and probably will never be deployed to most sites. I'd guess everyone who uses meta regularly has a pet feature or bug that they wish we'd spend time on.\n\nIn addition, while the change will help sites without designs get their own distinctive brand in time, the predominate effect so far has been to *water down existing site designs*. Since Stack Overflow was the base upon which the standard was built, sites like Math and TeX look a lot more like Stack Overflow than they used to. And let's not underestimate the very real cost changing a UI has on people. **It should be no surprise that people feel angry and helpless.**\n\nBoth the DAG and community teams are working on ways to make the transition less shocking and get important feedback sooner as we continue converting sites to the standard theme. To [quote Tim](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/373227/1438):\n\n> We're still a growing and relatively small company with limited resources. While we don't struggle and thrash around in the name of profitability, we're still going to struggle and thrash around as we encounter even scarier problems that come with becoming more established. We're *way* more public and open than anyone else and as you can see, it has been a heck of a ride. We wish we could do everything, right now, and make everyone happy. We'll get there.\n\nYou know how companies that put you on hold always say \"Your call is very important to us\"? Yeah, I don't believe it either. Then again, you gotta feel for them since many companies *do* care about keeping customers happy, but can't afford to have a call center full of people waiting around to give individualized service. So they gotta say *something* while you wait. Fortunately, as a software company, we can do more than ask you to reboot your router (as my ISP invariably asks). Sometimes we can [fix things twice](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/) and get at the root problem.\n\nAt any rate, we can do better and maybe you have some practical ideas. How can we serve you better while still meeting our goal to standardize all 174 site themes? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems to me that the timing of all of this is just deeply unfortunate. \n\nIn my some three year experience with Stack Exchange as a whole, new features had to be fought over. You had to have broad community support, a highly upvoted meta post, a sharp and unassailable argument and business case, and quite a bit of luck to get your feature implemented. It was a unforgiving process that frustrated many people because it seemed like nothing was getting done, but it felt *fair*, because everyone and their pet feature request had to go through it. Now\n\n> Since Stack Overflow is a critical part of many programmers' workflow,\n>  we get criticism from outside the community.

I don't assume any malice of intent, I think y'all heard criticism you've really taken to heart and I'm not about to try and discredit that criticism or its validity in any way, but after **years** of being utterly unapproachable in the way of letting public suggestions affect large changes, you start to roll out a bunch of them. Not because the community asked for it (actually despite large contingents of the community asking you not to do it), but because **outsiders** with seemingly no stake or contribution to the success of the site asked for it.\n\nThis has a really bad and demoralizing PR look for all the people who've been patiently chipping away, spending their time, making their cases, for their suggestions to go nowhere. Now suddenly someone makes a few tweets or a blog post and you're reacting? Regardless of what it actually is, it just **feels** unfair and contemptuous. You have to really stretch and force yourself to assume good intent to not be insulted by that.\n\nI'm not sure what the solution can be, but in the three years since joining this site and all the meta activity I've read before then I've never seen this amount of outright cynicism and dislike towards SE the company. It seems like the majority of the default trust and goodwill y'all used to have has been spent and replaced by cynicism and negativity. It is really sad to see rational discourse go off a cliff so dramatically."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: According to the post, why has there been a recent shift in how Stack Exchange responds to feedback and implements changes?\n\nA) The community's meta posts have become more persuasive and well-argued\nB) Stack Exchange has hired more developers to implement user requests\nC) Criticism from outside the community has been taken more seriously\nD) A/B testing has shown that users want more frequent changes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The post indicates that Stack Exchange has recently started paying more attention to criticism from outside the community, which they had traditionally ignored. This represents a shift from their previous approach of primarily considering feedback from active community members on meta. The passage states: \"Recently, however, we've heard criticism that we've taken to heart and responded to. If you can find the truth buried within misunderstandings of outsiders it can be useful to hear from the largely-silent majority of people who use the site passively.\"\n\nThis change in approach has led to the implementation of changes that were not necessarily requested by the active community, causing frustration among long-time contributors who feel their input is being overlooked in favor of outside criticism.

All SMP mods are automatically compatible with Singleplayer Minecraft and are installed in the same way, but Bukkit plugins are designed specifically for the custom server called Craftbukkit. Minecraft can only launch its *own* built\\-in server, so there's no way (I know of) to have it run Craftbukkit instead when you click \"Singleplayer\".\n\nHowever, running craftbukkit locally is totally doable. It won't slow down your machine more than playing singleplayer normally does, because singleplayer runs a hidden server anyway. When you play on a local Craftbukkit server, Minecraft doesn't bother launching its own singleplayer server, so it ends up being the same amount of stuff running on your computer. Of course, you still have to set up the Craftbukkit server and install the Last Airbender plugin properly, but that's doable with some reading and learning.

I'm thinking that we could establish something similar to what Stack Overflow currently has with Microsoft, but with companies that distribute PC hardware/software, Microsoft included. \n\nThe relationship, in my eyes, would be something along these lines:\n\n* We identify a few companies that share the same interest as Super Users and contact them requesting a partnership\n* We review their products, that they would provide and then give them away to the community\n* Maybe we could even plug in an ad or two in the ad box as the same time?\n\nSome advantages of teaming up with other companies would be:\n\n* Incentive for more users to blog with us\n* Publicity for the Super User Blog, Super User and the partnered company\n* Depending on the partnership/sponsorship, we might be able to do a few more contests/giveaways during the year (similar to [Apptivate.MS](http://apptivate.ms/))\n\nWhat does the community and Stack Exchange employees feel about this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Personally, I am very strongly against this idea. Sites that offer reviews should *never* be partnered with companies that produce the products under review. For obvious reasons this is likely to lead to at worst false reviewing and at best a pressure towards a favorable review that blog authors will have to fight against.\n\nOne of my favorite points about SU is that it is a community, it is a site moderated by us and we are the ones taking part in it. Why would we want to invite a faceless company into our midst? It seems like this suggestion would pave the way for SU to become \"just another site\" controlled by the same corporate interests.\n\nThe advantages you list seem to be mostly for the company. All we get is a couple of freebies they may send our way while the company gets \"free publicity\", free adds in the add box, and a direct line to a huge potential customer base. All of this could be worth a lot of money but we are offering it free for the dubious benefit of a few free items that would be distributed how among the pretty large SU user base? They would end up going to a select few chosen either by lottery (I hope) or by some other arbitrary method. The end result would be the same, a select few get a free gift of a shiny new router and the company solves its advertising problems for free. \n\nThe trilogy sites are rapidly becoming the *de facto* source of information for their respective fields. I feel it is very important to keep them independent, to keep the right \\-\\-as a community\\-\\- to chose who and what should be advertised on the side bar. To chose what to review and to be able to give honest answers without fear of retribution.\n\nI think a better way to get more publicity to the blog would be to link to it from the main site, for example, or advertise *it* in the side bar more rather than to invite corporate backing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is the primary concern with pursuing partnerships/sponsorships with outside companies for product reviews on the Super User Blog?\n\nA) It would reduce the quality of blog posts\nB) It might lead to biased or false reviews due to pressure from partnered companies\nC) It would decrease user engagement on the blog\nD) It would limit the variety of products that could be reviewed\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The top answer strongly opposes the idea of partnering with companies for product reviews.

But it's LITERALLY between a rock and a hard place!\n\nI've watched tons of videos on PVC pipe repair, but all the examples are shown in a much more workable and open area. So you can cut the pipe, get new fittings and glue everything together again. Here we can see that I only have this much space to work with. I'm thinking my best bet is repair the cracked pipe somehow and seal the leak. I know the pipe is being bent, but I don't have many options without removing the tree.

A search for \"this is a velociraptor\" returns twice as many results as \"this is velocipaptor\", and of the latter many results are actually:\n\n1. \"This is a velociraptor\" or other results that don't match the phrase perfectly.\n2. Where \"this is a velociraptor\" is part of a phrase where velociraptor is modifying another noun (\"this is velociraptor country\").\n3. Where it's the middle of a phrase that likewise uses it differently (\"The proper reaction to this is velociraptor noises\").\n4. This question.\n5. Cases where *velociraptor* is used as the name of a character or product (\"This is Velociraptor 2\\.0\\. He has 3 motors and 1 sensors.\" referring to a Lego project).\n\nOnly a very few uses match what you describe, and they might well have been typos.\n\nIt certainly is used in the likes of Discovery channel programmes, but there it is for effect. Here, using it as if it is the name of a given individual dinosaur adds an immediacy and sense of closeness as they go on to describe its qualities; generally focusing on the damage it could do to prey (which says as much about the Discovery channel as it does about velociraptors). It also highlights the idea that the technology used to reproduce what a velociraptor looked and moved like is \"introducing\" you to one.\n\nAnd it does work, in my opinion and is hence a bit of poetic license worth taking. It doesn't work as well with things you are familiar with, with shorter names, or with multi\\-part names (\"This is great white shark\" doesn't work as well as \"This is shark\"). But it can still be used with them, or indeed with anything, and it sometimes is.\n\n(With more familiar things, rather than add a sense of immediacy, it can give a sense of distance and seeing afresh. I can recall a British nature show that used \"this is cat\" in examining the anatomy of a cat, and it did give an impression of \"seeing for the first time\" a very familiar animal).\n\nNormally though, we use *a/an* and *the* with prehistoric animals.\n\nThe only species name that is more often found without an article than with is *man*, where the lack of article highlights that we are considering people as a species rather than as individuals.

The passage explains that while \"This is velociraptor\" without an article is sometimes used, particularly in contexts like nature documentaries, it's not the standard grammatical form. This usage is a stylistic choice aimed at creating a sense of immediacy or freshness when introducing the species. Normally, articles (a/an/the) are used with \"velociraptor\" just as they are with other animal names. The passage explicitly states that a search for \"this is a velociraptor\" returns more results than \"this is velociraptor,\" indicating that the article-less form is less common.

According to tests by [BigClive](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigclivedotcom/videos) (sorry, I cannot recall exactly in which video he mentions this) some batteries can be completely discharged (0 Volts), charged again and then appear to still have their full capacity. Note that the \"fully discharged\" state did not last long (hours or days perhaps).\n\n*Lithium\\-ion batteries age*\n\nThat is true but also depends everything I mention above and also how you treat the battery. For example in some military applications Li\\-Ion cells are charged not up to 4\\.1 \\- 4\\.2 V (like in many consumer products) but to 3\\.8 V or less. This places less stress in the cells making them last longer.\n\n*but I assume Apple doesn't charge the devices to 100% anyway*\n\nThat will actually be the **battery manufacturer** producing the batteries in such a way that they are at around 40% to 60% charge when finished. They're not charged or discharged as that takes too long! The charge level can be set by using the proper ratios of chemicals during production. Same as non rechargeable batteries are made to have 100% charge.\n\nIf you want to store a device for some time, I suggest charging the battery to a value between 40% to 70 % (my rough estimate). Then if possible **remove** the battery! \n\nIf removing the battery is not possible make sure that the device is switched off and store it in a location where it cannot get very hot or cold.\n\nTo protect against fire and overcharging (when the charging circuit in a product breaks) nearly **any** device will have a battery protection circuit. This will simply disconnect the battery when the battery is in danger. I am quite sure Apple devices have this.\n\nBTW, this does not protect against manufacturing issues with batteries which is often the cause of batteries catching fire."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer leaves their lithium-ion battery-powered device in storage for several months.

All you need is the [`tr` utility](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tr.1.html), plus a loop and redirections to act on the files that are passed as arguments to the script.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file do\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$file.safe\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nWith the option `-d`, `tr` removes the specified characters. The characters to remove are passed together as the first non\\-option argument. You can use backslash escapes to represent special characters: `\\n` for a newline (^J), `\\r` for a carriage return (^M), `\\t` for a tab (^I), etc.\n\nI haven't reproduced the code for asking the user because it's pointless. Directories will cause an error with redirection anyway, and it's really the job of the caller not to request a nonsensical action such as treating a directory as a regular file, so I also skipped that part.\n\nIf you want to replace the original file, write to a temporary file then move the result in place.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file do\n  tmp=\"$(TMPDIR=$(dirname -- \"$file\") mktemp)\"\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nThe temporary file name is constructed using `mktemp` so that the script is robust. It will work as long as you have write permission to the directory containing the file, without risking overwriting an existing file. It's secure even if that directory is writable by other users who might try to inject other data (a potential problem in `/tmp`).\n\nThe `mv` command is only invoked if the call to `tr` succeeded, so there's no risk of losing data if `tr` fails, e.g. because the disk becomes full midway through.\n\nIf you want to avoid replacing the file by a new, identical file if it doesn't contain any special characters, there are two ways:\n\n* You can check for the special characters first. There are several ways to do it. One way is to remove everything except those special characters and count the number of resulting characters. As an optimization, pipe through `head -c 1` so that you don't need to go through the whole file if a special character is found close to the top: that way the count is 0 if there's nothing to do and 1 otherwise.\n\n```\nif [ \"$(tr -dc '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" | head -c 1 | wc -c)\" -ne 0 ]; then\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\nfi\n\n```\n* You can do the transformation, then check if it's identical to the original. This can be slower if the files are often already in the desired state. On the other hand, this technique generalizes to cases where it isn't easy to determine whether the file is in the desired state.\n\n```\ntr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" &&\nif cmp -s \"$tmp\" \"$file\"; then\n  rm -- \"$tmp\"\nelse\n  mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\nfi\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scripts most efficiently removes carriage return (^M) and tab (^I) characters from files passed as arguments, while also being secure and robust?\n\nA) \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in \"$@\"; do\n    sed -i 's/\\r//g; s/\\t//g' \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nB) \n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file do\n  tmp=\"$(TMPDIR=$(dirname -- \"$file\") mktemp)\"\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nC)\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in \"$@\"; do\n    if grep -q $'\\r\\t' \"$file\"; then\n        cat \"$file\" | tr -d '\\r\\t' > \"$file.tmp\"\n        mv \"$file.tmp\" \"$file\"\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\nD)\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in \"$@\"; do\n    awk '{gsub(/\\r|\\t/,\"\")}1' \"$file\" > \"$file.tmp\"\n    mv \"$file.tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and secure solution.

With that information in hand, you can recover your system and remove Ubuntu properly in the future (should the need arise again)....\n\nWhat Happened?\n--------------\n\nMost Ubuntu installations, on both BIOS\\-based and EFI\\-based systems, split GRUB across two or more locations:\n\n* **The main GRUB binary** \\-\\- This code is run by the firmware. Importantly, it does *not* reside in the Ubuntu root (`/`) or `/boot` partition. On BIOS\\-based computers, it resides in the first few sectors of the hard disk (or if the disk uses GPT, in the first sector of the disk and in the [BIOS Boot Partition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_Boot_partition)). On EFI\\-based computers, it resides in the [EFI System Partition (ESP).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition) This means that the main GRUB binary will not be erased when you delete an Ubuntu partition, and the firmware will continue to boot it; however....\n* **GRUB support files** \\-\\- In most cases, GRUB loads its configuration file and other support files from the Ubuntu `/boot/grub` directory. This directory *is* deleted when you delete an Ubuntu installation.\n\nThe result is that when you delete an Ubuntu partition, GRUB can launch, but it can't do anything, because it's been figuratively lobotomized.\n\nThat said, one thing about your story is puzzling: You say that you're no longer able to boot from a USB drive. An Ubuntu installer image is designed to be self\\-contained; it does not rely on the contents of your hard disk, and should not be affected by the state of GRUB (or anything else) on that disk. You *must* be running into some unrelated problem \\-\\- maybe some RAM has gone bad since you did your initial installation; or you're trying to boot a different version of Ubuntu that doesn't like your video card; or you prepared the USB drive incorrectly. These are just wild guesses, though; there are about a million possible reasons why a boot from a USB drive might fail. In any event, I recommend you try other Linux distributions or prepare your medium using another program to work around this problem. If necessary, post a new question with more details about that aspect of the problem if you can't get it to work.\n\nHow to Recover\n--------------\n\nRecovering your system involves installing a working boot loader on your computer. It sounds like yours is BIOS\\-based, so this means modifying the MBR. If you want to make your Windows bootable again, the best approach is probably to use a Windows recovery tool. There are Windows procedures for restoring an MBR, but I don't recall the details. A Google search turned up [this tutorial,](http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/20864-mbr-restore-windows-7-master-boot-record.html) but there are 658,000 others in my search, so try your own search if that procedure doesn't work for you.\n\nAnother option is to re\\-install Ubuntu (or any other OS, really). As part of the OS installation process, a new boot loader will be installed. If you re\\-install Ubuntu, that boot loader will be GRUB, and the installer *should* detect Windows and make it an option in the GRUB menu.\n\nOne caveat is to watch your boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI); you don't want to mix them. It sounds like you've got a BIOS\\-mode Windows installation, so you do *not* want to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. If your computer is from before 2011, chances are this won't happen, since EFIs started to become common only in mid\\-to\\-late 2011\\. If you've got a more recent computer, though, you may need to be careful. After booting your installation medium but before installing, drop to a shell and look for a directory called `/sys/firmware/efi`. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode. If you've booted in the wrong mode, try again, but pay attention to boot menu options. Typically, external media have two options, one with the string \"UEFI\" and one without it. The one with the \"UEFI\" identifier boots in EFI mode and the one without boots in BIOS mode.\n\nHow to Not Do This Again\n------------------------\n\nIf you need to remove Ubuntu again on a BIOS\\-based computer, it's best to restore a non\\-Ubuntu boot loader to the MBR before you delete the Ubuntu partition(s). You can use a Windows recovery disc to do this, or there are ways to do this from Ubuntu, [as described here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader) (among other places).\n\nOn an EFI\\-based computer, you can use `efibootmgr` to change the boot order before you delete the Ubuntu partition(s). Type `sudo efibootmgr` alone to see the options, then identify the Windows (or other OS's) boot entry number from the list, and use the `-o` option to set it first in the list, as in `sudo efibootmgr -o 2,7` to boot `Boot0002` first and to boot `Boot0007` as a fallback. Another option is to delete the `/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu` directory from Ubuntu immediately before you wipe out the Ubuntu partition(s).\n\nOn either type of computer, another option is to set your boot loader up in a way that can survive the removal of Ubuntu. One way to do this is to use a separate Ubuntu `/boot` partition, but to *not delete it* along with the main Ubuntu partition. Then GRUB will continue to operate, although it will present non\\-functional Ubuntu options and, in the absence of a Linux installation, it will be difficult to change its boot options. There are ways to set GRUB up on a FAT partition in an OS\\-independent way. The [GRUB4DOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/grub4dos/) boot loader can be used on a BIOS\\-based computer, for instance. On an EFI\\-based system, alternatives like [gummiboot](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot) or my own [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) don't rely on Ubuntu partitions, and can be used instead of or in addition to GRUB."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a multi-form question suitable for an exam:\n\nQuestion: After deleting an Ubuntu partition on a BIOS-based system, a user encounters a GRUB rescue prompt and can no longer boot their computer. What is the most likely explanation for this situation?\n\nA) The entire GRUB bootloader was completely removed when the Ubuntu partition was deleted.\nB) The computer's BIOS has been corrupted and can no longer load any operating system.\nC) The main GRUB binary remains in the MBR, but it can't access its configuration files which were in the deleted partition.\nD) The Ubuntu partition contained critical Windows boot files, preventing Windows from booting as well.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a typical Ubuntu installation on a BIOS-based system, GRUB is split across two locations. The main GRUB binary resides in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or the first few sectors of the hard drive, which isn't affected when deleting the Ubuntu partition. However, GRUB's configuration files and support files are stored in the /boot/grub directory within the Ubuntu partition. When this partition is deleted, GRUB can still launch (as it's still in the MBR), but it can't access its configuration files, resulting in the GRUB rescue prompt. This scenario perfectly matches the symptoms described in the question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the entire GRUB bootloader is not removed; the main binary remains. Option B is unlikely as BIOS corruption wouldn't typically result in a GRUB rescue prompt. Option D is incorrect because Ubuntu and Windows typically maintain separate boot files, and deleting Ubuntu shouldn't directly affect Windows' ability to boot."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/15", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/257950", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 257950, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an old PowerEdge 850 server containing a Pentium D 820 chip.

So it may or may not properly report double bit errors.\n\nAnd of course all the chips in the system are initialised by the BIOS, so it significantly affects the DIMMs you can use, and whether the ECC memory is used as non\\-ECC memory, or limited ECC memory or whatever.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I find BIOS fascinating: it is where a lot of the difference between two otherwise similar platforms gets created."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a server system with a Pentium D processor that doesn't support ECC, but with a chipset and motherboard that do support ECC, what is the primary factor determining whether ECC memory will function correctly?\n\nA) The processor's integrated memory controller\nB) The south bridge (ICH7)\nC) The BIOS and its memory reference code\nD) The type of ECC memory installed (buffered or unbuffered)\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The BIOS and its memory reference code are crucial in determining whether ECC memory will function correctly in this scenario.

Am I wasting my time trying to get a feature that doesn't work to work? If the built\\-in mail app doesn't support IMAP with X.509 client certs (ie: they only work with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync accounts), are there any 3rd party apps that do?\n\nOnly iOS 5\\.1 or newer is of interest; 5\\.1 is the version I've been testing with.\n\n---\n\nI'm the admin of a network that's required by policy to use X.509 client certificates to protect all external communication, including our IMAP mail server (Cyrus IMAPd) and SMTP server (postfix). Neither will accept a connection without the client presenting a valid X.509 client certificate. Disabling the client certificate requirement is not an option for me, and we aren't permitted to tunnel traffic in via VPN for similar reasons.\n\nWe now have iPad users who want to connect to our network, and are finding the iPad to be a bit of a problem.\n\nFor users on desktop machines we usually install Thunderbird, as it has rock solid IMAP with excellent client certificate support; it \"just works\" and is the same to support on every platform. This isn't an option for iPad.\n\nUnfortunately the iPad's built\\-in Mail app doesn't seem to cope with client certificates for IMAP. I can install our org's root cert and the user's client cert using the iPhone Configuration Utility. Both are shown as \"verified\" in Settings\\-\\>General\\-\\>Profiles. The iPad then accepts our server as trusted and omits any warnings about the server's identity not being verified.\n\nMail still fails to send a client certificate when one is demanded so the server terminates the handshake. It doesn't prompt the user to select one, nor does it automatically send the client certificate it has installed for the user that matches the CA certificate presented by the server.\n\nExamination of the traffic flow between client and server shows that the TLS negotiation fails when the iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates when client certificates are demanded by the server. See below.\n\nWhen connected to the internal network over encrypted WiFi, where no client cert is required to get mail, the device connects and downloads mail just fine. External access (public WiFi or over 3G) fails, whether I use the IMAPs port 993 with \"Use SSL\" checked or the IMAP\\+TLS port 143 with or without \"Use SSL\" checked. Other than the apparent lack of client certificate negotiation support for IMAP, it's perfect.\n\nReferences to client certificate support in [the documentation for Apple's \"Enterprise support\"](http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iPad_Business.pdf) only appear where Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync is discussed, and where Cisco VPN support is discussed.\n\nThere are a few questions on Apple's discussion forums, but no recent ones and no useful answers. I'd link to them, but Apple's forums are \"down for maintenance\" at the moment.\n\nAs a workaround I can probably set up a locked down VPN using the iPad's automatic VPN connection support to talk to a client\\-cert authed IPSec VPN that can *only* talk to the IMAP and SMTP servers on the appropriate ports plus DNS, nothing else. It'd be a pretty gruesome hack to have to perpetrate though.\n\n---\n\nBTW, the client\\<\\-\\>server conversation is:\n\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Client Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Server Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Certificate, Certificate Request, Server Hello Done\n (Sends server cert, signing root cert, \n DN of accepted client cert signer which happens to be the same as the root that signed the server cert)\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Certificate\n (empty set of certificates, zero certs included)\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Handshake failure\n\nIn other words, the server says \"this is me, I expect you to provide a certificate signed by authority to prove who you are\" and the client replies with \"Um, my papers are in this empty envelope here. Look, a cassowary!\"\n\nThe client has the root cert installed, and has a client cert installed that has the signer DN demanded by the server.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On a MacBook with no number pad, the key combination `fn``return` produces the Enter key.

The documentation describes that despite installing the organization's root certificate and user's client certificate on the iPad, the built-in Mail app fails to send a client certificate when demanded by the server. The iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates during the TLS negotiation, causing the handshake to fail.

See picture for the breadboard setup (focus on the pullup resistor).\n\n**The software works fine** and I get 5 sensor readings per second if I wire **a bare\\-bone 10K pullup resistor** between the hole next to the MCU's SCL pin \\#21, and a hole on the 3\\.3V rail of the breadboard. This is standard procedure for I2C schemes in order to pull the I2C SCL high by default. Same for SDA.\n\nHowever, I wanted to make wiring up things on the breadboard much easier and use **a modded Dupont cable for the pullup**. So I took a 30 centimeter Dupont wire, cut it in the middle, and soldered a standard 10K pullup resistor in between and put a shrink tube around it.

Everybody can preorder on Amazon and get a free Beta key. I argue that this is publicly available, as *everybody* can just buy (preorder) a copy and play (the Beta). There is currently no limitation on the amount of Beta keys.\n\nIf the community decides otherwise we should have at least some *official* rules for this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reason we close pre\\-release questions is that they are speculative. (That, and it causes weird corner cases once the question is no longer speculative...)\n\nIf a \"pre\\-release\" question about a game can be asked and answered without speculation because an alpha/beta/early version exists, **regardless of the number of people who are/could be in possession of said game,** it should be left open. (Unless there's some other reason to close \\- bad questions are bad questions, regardless of topic/game)\n\nTrying to gauge the number of people who have a game and make a decision about whether or not it should be answered based on that information is problematic. IMO, there's no compelling reason to distinguish between the current openness of the alpha/beta/whatever.\n\nIf we get to the point where a good, non\\-speculative pre\\-release question is attracting speculative answers, then *those aren't answers* and should be flagged/deleted and potentially the question protected."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, when should a pre-release question about a game be allowed on the gaming StackExchange?\n\nA) Only when the game is officially released to the public\nB) When there are a limited number of beta keys available\nC) When the game can be answered without speculation due to an existing alpha/beta version, regardless of how many people have access\nD) Only when everyone can freely access the game without any purchase\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer states that if a \"pre-release\" question about a game can be asked and answered without speculation because an alpha/beta/early version exists, regardless of the number of people who have access to the game, it should be left open. The answer emphasizes that the number of people who have the game is not the determining factor, but rather whether the question can be answered non-speculatively based on an existing version of the game. Options A, B, and D all focus on the availability or release status of the game, which the answer explicitly states is not the primary consideration for allowing pre-release questions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/26", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/62289", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/17795/"], "docs_id": 62289, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \"Shambles\" is one of the few singular nouns in English that blatantly resembles a plural noun.

Which of the following is perfect?\n\n* The country's economy is in shambles.\n* The country's economy is in a shambles.\n* The country's economy is a shambles.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The weird usage seems to have developed in the same way as \"a headquarters\". Consider the following Ngram: \n\n![a/the shamble/shambles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/goJpF.png)\n\nThe original phrase seems to have been \"shambles\" or \"the shambles\", almost always plural. It meant \"a place for slaughtering animals\", but later came to be also used for scenes of carnage, scenes of great disorder, and certain dangerous shoals at sea.\n\n[Etymonline](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shambles) says that \"shambles\" originally meant \"meat market\", having evolved from the word *schamil* meaning \"table or stall for vending\". I assume that it naturally started out as a plural, because there would be several butcher's stalls at a meat market.\n\nHowever, once \"shambles\" came to mean \"a scene of great disorder or carnage\", the things it referred to were more naturally singular, and so \"shambles\" slowly came to be used as a singular."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the evolution and current usage of the word \"shambles\" in English?\n\nA) \"Shambles\" has always been used as a singular noun, and the phrase \"a shambles\" is grammatically incorrect.\n\nB) \"Shambles\" originated as a plural noun meaning \"meat market,\" but has evolved to be used as both a singular and plural noun, with \"a shambles\" becoming an accepted phrase.\n\nC) The word \"shambles\" is exclusively used in the plural form, and phrases like \"in shambles\" or \"a shambles\" are modern misuses of the term.\n\nD) \"Shambles\" began as a singular noun referring to a single butcher's stall and later expanded to include multiple stalls, which is why we now use \"a shambles.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The word \"shambles\" originally came from the Old English word \"schamil,\" meaning \"table or stall for vending,\" and initially referred to a meat market in its plural form. Over time, its meaning evolved to describe scenes of disorder or carnage. As it began to be used for more singular concepts, the usage shifted, allowing for both plural and singular forms. This evolution explains why phrases like \"in shambles,\" \"in a shambles,\" and \"a shambles\" are all considered acceptable in modern English, despite the word's plural origins. The question tests understanding of the word's etymology, semantic shift, and current usage patterns in English."}}
