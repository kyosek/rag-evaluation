I am trying to use an arduino to communicate with another device using RS485\\. The problem is that I can see the data being sent but, the device does not reply at all. Here's the break down so far:\n\n* I am using a hardware serial port and a Max487 rs485 transceiver which is attached to a custom sheild.\n* I am able to get the device working over RS232 the same library on a different Serial port so, I don't believe its a software issue.\n* I have also been able to communicate with the device using a usb to rs485 converter. This wasn't attached to my Arduino, I sent the data using realterm. So, i don't think its a problem with the device.\n* I am using a shielded cable with 2 twisted pairs. One pair I am using for ground, the other for the Non\\-inverting/inverting signals. The cable has an impedance of 120\u03a9. My cable is about 11m long.\n* I have a 120\u03a9 terminating resistor on my pcb and have enabled the biasing termination on the device. (The inverting line is 5V biased, the non inverting is at 0v).\n* When I look at the traces, I can see that all the data is being sent, along with the parity and stop bits. You can see image below. It's a picture of the 2 traces and the result of (non inverting line \\- inverting line). The scale is 1x\n* I am writing !(Receiver Enable) and Driver Enable pins high when transmitting, and low as soon as the transmission is complete.\n* When I couldn't get it working with my first shield, I made another. Unfortunately, I am still having trouble.\n* The voltage levels for the device are:\n\n\t+ logic 0: transmitter: 1\\.5 \\- 5V receiver: \\>0\\.3V\n\t+ logic 1: transmitter: \\-1\\.5 \\- \\-5V receiver: \\<\\=\\-0\\.3V\n\nIn summary, I don't think its a software issue. I've done a lot of reading but, haven't managed to find anything that helped. Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be preventing the device from responding?\n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all the help everyone. \n\nThe device is a pump with a controller, [which can be found here](https://leyboldproducts.oerlikon.com/products/produktkatalog_04.aspx?cid=1837). I spent some time today using the usb\\-\\>rs485 converter. \n\nI used it to successfully send data between the computer and the arduino in both directions. I found and fixed 2 software bugs but, it didn't help when I tried it with the pump again. When I looked at the arduino/computer trace, I noticed that (ignoring the horrendous wobbles) the voltage levels were different to what I get when I had the arduino hooked up to the pump. I've added an image. When using the arduino/computer, the voltage level switches about zero and when no signal is being sent, the voltage is about \\-2V. When using the arduino/pump, the voltage level switches about zero and when no signal is being sent, the voltage is about \\-1V. Also, when I was using the arduino\\+computer, I was receiving unexpected NULL characters at the begining and end of the message. I read about a possible cause being a lack of biasing but, I am using biasing resistors on the pump end. \n\nI also, had a quick look at the traces when I connect the computer to the pump via the converter. I had no success in establishing communication. The traces looked horrible though so, perhaps I hooked it up wrong. I'll double check this and post another update.\n\nI have also checked ifthe last bit is being sent properly. I'm using an interrupt triggered when the TX buffer is empty. This drives the !(Receiver Enable) and Driver Enable pins low as soon as the last high/low bit is over. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on these results?\n\n**UPDATE 2**\nSory for the delayed response. \n\nI've had a bit more of a play around and have managed to get the computer communicating with the pump via the usb\\-\\>rs485 converter. To do so, I had to remove the terminating resistor on the usb\\-\\>rs485 converter end but left the termination and biasing at the pump end. You can see the trace below (the third picture). Note that the voltage level the signal oscillates about is approx 2V as @davidcary said he gets. Compare this with the voltage levels of the second picture (same set up but with the terminating resistor in place) of approx 0V. You'll also notice that the signal levels of the arduino to pump (picture 1\\) are about 0\\.5V lower than that of picture 3 but the oscillations are much smaller. How could I go about increasing the voltage swing? I am converting 24V to 9V using [one of these](http://www.produktinfo.conrad.com/datenblaetter/150000-174999/156676-da-01-en-DC_DC_WANDLER_1A_TSR_1_2490.pdf) and using it to power my arduino and rs485 chip, if that helps at all. \n\nI'e been playing around with the termination resistors but haven't had any luck yet. I am also trying to use a USB\\-\\>TTL cable I have to send data to the shield, through the MAX487 and to the pump. I haven't had any success with this yet. \n\nThanks again for all your help \n\n![Signal when I have the arduino connected to the pump controller](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqOI5.jpg)\n\n![Signal when I have the arduino connected to a computer via a usb to rs485 converter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0zVt1.jpg)\n\n![Successful communication between computer and pump](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zk1n2.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rotary switch under discussion is typically used for preset / factory setting or maintenance purposes \\- such as for setting a part of a device address, a configuration value to be read during device operation, or selection of power path for enabling one of several circuit sub\\-sections. \n\nThe particular part you have selected has silver\\-plated copper contacts (`Q suffix`) for power routing, rather than low\\-level signal routing or configuration setting.\n\nThe lack of available knobs for this type of switch aligns with the design goal of not making it convenient for end\\-users to make changes \\- like having a sticker \"*No user\\-serviceable parts inside*\".\n\nFor a hand\\-actuated equivalent, look for flatted actuator, or knob actuator designs.

Each $h\\_{iy}$ depends on the height in the first year (which depends on the person $i$) and increases with the years (the rate of increase can also depend on the person $i$), so you have something like $h\\_{iy} \\= \\\\beta\\_{1i} \\+ \\\\beta\\_{2i} y \\+ \\\\epsilon$, where the coefficients $\\\\beta\\_{1i}, \\\\beta\\_{2i}$ depend on the person (hence the subscipt $i$), but **if you can estimate such an equation, then you have one regression line for each person and you can look, for that single person, which points are 'far away' from that individual person's own regression line.** \n\nA reference book is Fitzmaurice, Laird, Ware, \"Applied longitudinal analysis\" where you can find all the details, so I will just explain the main lines of the reasoning:\n\nIt is assumed that the $\\\\beta\\_{1i}$ and $\\\\beta\\_{2i}$ are normally distributed with a mean $\\\\beta\\_1$ (resp. $\\\\beta\\_2$) and a standard deviation $\\\\sigma\\_1$ (resp. $\\\\sigma\\_2$) (so the assumption is that the heights in the first year are normally distributed, just as the growth rates). So we can re\\-write $\\\\beta\\_{ki}$ as $\\\\beta\\_{ki}\\=\\\\beta\\_k \\+ b\\_{kj}$ where $\\\\beta\\_k$ is the mean of all $\\\\beta\\_{ki}$ and $b\\_{ki} \\\\sim N(0;\\\\sigma\\_i), k\\=1,2$. \n\nSo your regression becomes $h\\_{iy}\\=\\\\beta\\_1\\+b\\_{1i} \\+ (\\\\beta\\_2\\+b\\_{2i})y\\+\\\\epsilon$, this is the form that you find in the reference Fitzmaurice et al. \n\nthe $b\\_{ki}$ are called the **random effects**. The $\\\\beta\\_{k}$ are the **fixed effects**. \n\nTo illustrate this let me use some simulated data:\n\n```\n# this is just for simuating data, you have the data, the simulation generates heights\n# for N=500 people for 10 years. \n\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n# simulation for 500 persons\nN<-500\n\n#simulate the heights in the first year, mean 1.7, sd 0.2, \n# generate a random number of each of the N persons\nh0<-rnorm(n=N, mean=1.7, sd=0.2)\n\n#generate a random growth rate for each of the N persons\nch1<-rnorm(n=N, mean=0.01, sd=0.01)\n\n# simulate h_iy:  the height in the first year + (annual growth x year) + error term\nh<-h0 + ch1 %*% t(1:10) + rnorm(n=N, mean=0, sd=0.02)\n\n# reformat it a bit so that it is useable later on\ncolnames(h)<-1:10\ndf<-cbind( data.frame(subject=1:nrow(h)), \n           as.data.frame(h) )\n\ndf.molten<-melt(data=df, id.vars=\"subject\", value.name=\"height\", variable.name=\"year\")\ndf.molten$year<-as.numeric(df.molten$year)\n\n```\n\nAfter simulating the data, we will now estimate the above mentioned equation as a linear mixed effects model (with the nlme package in R):\n\n```\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nlme.h<-lme(height  ~ year + 1,       # we estimate height as function of year\n           data=df.molten,           # on the simulated data\n           random= ~ 1 + year | subject,  # we use a random effect on the intercept and on the coeffcient of year\n           control=lmeControl(opt=\"optim\"),\n           method=\"REML\")\n\n```\n\nThe values that are estimated for your data can be found with the following calls: \n\n```\nlme.fix<-fixed.effects(lme.h)\nlme.blup<-random.effects(lme.h)\n\n```\n\nThe first one gives you the fixed effects $\\\\beta\\_k$ (compare them to the values used in the simulation), the second one gives you the best linear unbiased prediction (blup) of the random effect **for each person of your dataset**. \n\nCompare now the 'estimated fixed effects \\+ the blup predictors of the random effects' for each person to your input (in this case simulated) data, first for the intercept:\n\n```\ndf.plot<-data.frame(sim=h0, estim=lme.blup[[1]]+lme.fix[1])\n\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x=sim,y=estim))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nI can not upload plots from here but if you execute the code then you get a graph with on the horizontal axis the simulated initial (i.e. in the first year) heights and on the vertical axis the estimated/predicted values for each person in the first year, the red line is the bisector. \n\nSimilar, but for the coefficient of the year: \n\n```\ndf.plot<-data.frame(sim=ch1, estim=lme.blup[[2]]+lme.fix[2])\n\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x=sim,y=estim))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nWith these results you have a regression line for each inidivual person, you can also estimate the variance around the line and then find ''outliers'' for each person's line. For details I refer to Fitzmaurice et al. \n\nso for person $i$ you will find the regression line $h\\_{iy}\\=\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_1\\+\\\\hat{b}\\_{1i} \\+ (\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_2\\+\\\\hat{b}\\_{2i})y$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_1$ is in `lme.fix[1]`, $\\\\hat{b}\\_{1i}$ in `lme.blup[[1]][i]` and $\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_2$ is in `lme.fix[2]`, $\\\\hat{b}\\_{2i}$ in `lme.blup[[2]][i]`\n\nFor the details on the nlme package you can use [this pdf](http://verde.esalq.usp.br/~jorge/cursos/modelos_longitudinais/Mixed%20Effects%20Models%20in%20S%20and%20S-Plus.pdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing longitudinal height data for 100,000 individuals over 10 years.

It accounts for the longitudinal nature of the data, recognizing that measurements are repeated for each person over time.\n\n2. The random intercepts allow for different baseline heights for each individual, while random slopes account for individual differences in growth rates.\n\n3. This method can handle the large number of subjects (100,000) while dealing with the relatively small number of measurements per person (up to 20).\n\n4. By estimating individual regression lines, it provides a personalized baseline for identifying unusual measurements, which is more sensitive than global thresholds or z-scores.\n\n5. It can accommodate the natural variation in growth patterns across individuals, making it more robust than simple threshold methods or tests that assume independence between measurements.\n\n6. This approach aligns with the suggestion in the documentation to use random effects for analyzing longitudinal data with multiple participants.\n\nOptions A and D are too simplistic and don't account for individual growth patterns or the longitudinal nature of the data.

I see a statistic as the value obtained from applying a function to the sample data. However, most examples of parameters relate to defining a parametric distribution. A common example is the mean and standard deviation to parameterise the normal distribution or the coefficients and error variance to parameterise a linear regression.\n\nHowever, there are many other values of the population distribution that are less prototypical (e.g., minimum, maximum, r\\-square in multiple regression, the .25 quantile, median, the number of predictors with non\\-zero coefficients, skewness, the number of correlations in a correlation matrix greater than .3, etc.). \n\nThus, **my questions** are:\n\n* Should any quantitative property of a population be labelled a \"parameter\"?\n* If yes, then why?\n* If no, what characteristics should not be labelled a parameter? What should they be labelled? And why?\n\n### Elaboration on confusion\n\nThe Wikipedia article on estimators states:\n\n> An \"estimator\" or \"point estimate\" is a statistic (that is, a function\n>  of the data) that is used to infer the value of an unknown parameter\n>  in a statistical model.\n\nBut I can define the unknown value as .25 quantile and I can develop an estimator for that unknown. I.e., not all quantitative properties of a population are parameters in the same way that say the mean and sd are parameters of a normal distribution, yet it is legitimate to seek to estimate any quantitative population property. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with many questions on definitions, answers need to have an eye both on the underlying principles and on the ways terms are used in practice, which can often be at least a little loose or inconsistent, even by individuals who are well informed, and more importantly, variable from community to community. \n\nOne common principle is that a statistic is a property of a sample, and a known constant, and a parameter is the corresponding property of the population, and so an unknown constant. The word \"corresponding\" is to be understood as quite elastic here. Incidentally, precisely this distinction and precisely this terminology are less than a century old, having being introduced by R.A. Fisher. \n\nBut \n\n1. A set\\-up of sample and population doesn't characterise all our own problems. Time series are one major class of examples in which the idea is rather of an underlying generating process, and something like that is arguably the deeper and more general idea.\n2. There are set\\-ups in which parameters change. Again, time series analysis provides examples.\n3. To the main point here, we don't in practice think of all the properties of a population or process as parameters. If some procedure assumes a model of a normal distribution, then the minimum and maximum are not parameters. (Indeed, according to the model, the minimum and maximum are arbitrarily large negative and positive numbers any way, not that that should worry us.)\n\nI would say that for once Wikipedia is pointing in the right direction here, and practice and principle are both respected if we say that **a parameter is whatever we are estimating**. \n\nThis helps too with other questions that have caused puzzlement. For example, if we calculate a 25% trimmed mean, what we are estimating? A reasonable answer is the corresponding property of the population, which in effect is defined by the estimation method. One terminology is that an estimator has an estimand, whatever it is estimating. Starting with some Platonic idea of a property \"out there\" (say the mode of a distribution) and thinking how to estimate that is reasonable, as is thinking up good recipes for analysing data and thinking through what they imply when regarded as inference. \n\nAs often in applied mathematics or science, there is a twofold aspect to a parameter. We often think of it as something real out there which we are discovering, but it is also true that it is something defined by our model of the process, so that it has no meaning outside the context of the model.\n\nTwo quite different points:\n\n1. Many scientists use the word \"parameter\" in the way that statisticians use variable. I have a scientist persona as well as a statistical one, and I would say that is unfortunate. Variables and properties are better words.\n2. It is remarkably common in wider English usage that parameter is thought to mean limits or bounds, which may stem from some original confusion between \"parameter\" and \"perimeter\".\n\n**A note on the estimand point of view**\n\nThe classical position is that we identify a parameter in advance and then decide how to estimate it, and this remains majority practice, but reversing the process is not absurd and can be helpful for some problems. I call this the estimand point of view. It has been in the literature for at least 50 years. Tukey (1962, p.60\\) urged that \n\n\"We must give even more attention to starting with an estimator and discovering what is a reasonable estimand, to discovering what is it reasonable to think of\nthe estimator as estimating.\"\n\nA similar point of view has been elaborated formally in considerable detail and depth by Bickel and Lehmann (1975\\) and informally with considerable lucidity by Mosteller and Tukey (1977, pp.32\\-34\\). \n\nThere is also an elementary version. Using\n(say) sample median or geometric mean to estimate the corresponding\npopulation parameter makes sense regardless of whether the underlying\ndistribution is symmetric, and the same goodwill can be extended to (e.g.) \nsample trimmed means, which are regarded as estimators of their\npopulation counterparts. \n\nBickel, P.J. and E.L.

It allows for flexibility in what can be considered a parameter, extending beyond just the defining characteristics of parametric distributions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too restrictive. While this is often true, the text mentions that parameters can sometimes change (e.g., in time series analysis) and not all problems fit neatly into a sample-population framework.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it limits parameters only to characteristics of parametric distributions, which is too narrow a definition according to the given information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it contradicts the idea presented in the text that estimators can be used to infer various quantitative properties of a population, not just pre-defined parameters.

The bag monad, is exectly the multiset monad whose category of algebras are the commutative monoids. Another name for the bag monad is a container.\n\nContainers are synonymous with polynomail functors. The data that defines a container are precisely the following morphisms in a locally Cartesian closed category $C$:\n\n$$ 1 \\\\xleftarrow{\\\\text{f}} X \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{g}} Y \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{h}} 1 $$\n\nWhere $1$ is the terminal object in $C$. This defines an endofunctor for which there is a monad. Specifically, the endofunctor is :\n\n$$ C/W \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{f^\\* }} C/X \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\Pi\\_g} C/Y \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\Sigma\\_h} C/Z $$\n\nWe are interested in endofunctors so $W$ and $Z$ are $1$ in $Set$.\n\nWhat is the polynomial form of the bag monad?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The bag monad is not polynomial.**\n\nAny polynomial endofunctor must preserve pullbacks: $f^\\*$ and $\\\\Pi\\_g$ preserve all limits since they\u2019re right adjoints, while $\\\\Sigma\\_h$, being just the forgetful functor from a slice category, is well known (and easily seen) to preserve all connected limits.\n\nHowever, the bag monad doesn\u2019t preserve pullbacks. Write $B$ for the bag monad, and consider the sets $X \\= \\\\{a,b\\\\}$, $Y \\= \\\\{y,z\\\\}$, and view their product as a pullback, $X \\\\times Y \\= X \\\\times\\_1 Y$. Then the canonical map $B(X \\\\times Y) \\\\to B(X) \\\\times\\_{B(1\\)} B(Y)$ fails to be injective, since $\\\\{(a,y),(b,z)\\\\}$ and $\\\\{(a,z),(b,y)\\\\}$ are distinct in $B(X \\\\times Y)$ but have the same image in $B(X)$ and $B(Y)$.\n\nThis example \u2014 and the fact that commutativity forms an obstacle to being polynomial, and similar sorts or representation \u2014 has appeared notably before in the literature, in for instance the note [3\\-computads do not form a presheaf category](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~zawado/Papers/Cex.pdf) by Michael Makkai and Marek Zawadowski, and (essentially) in Carlos Simpson\u2019s paper [*Homotopy types of strict 3\\-groupoids*](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810059)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the bag monad (also known as the multiset monad) in category theory?\n\nA) The bag monad can be expressed as a polynomial functor in the form $C/1 \\xrightarrow{f^*} C/X \\xrightarrow{\\Pi_g} C/Y \\xrightarrow{\\Sigma_h} C/1$\n\nB) The bag monad preserves all limits, including pullbacks, in the category of sets\n\nC) The category of algebras for the bag monad consists of all monoids\n\nD) The bag monad does not preserve pullbacks, which is evidence that it cannot be represented as a polynomial functor\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. The bag monad does not preserve pullbacks, which is a key property of polynomial functors. This can be demonstrated with a counterexample using sets X = {a,b} and Y = {y,z}. In the bag monad, the elements {(a,y),(b,z)} and {(a,z),(b,y)} in B(X \u00d7 Y) map to the same elements in B(X) and B(Y), showing that the canonical map B(X \u00d7 Y) \u2192 B(X) \u00d7_{B(1)} B(Y) is not injective. This failure to preserve pullbacks is strong evidence that the bag monad cannot be represented as a polynomial functor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the bag monad cannot be expressed as a polynomial functor.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, as explained, the bag monad does not preserve pullbacks, which are a type of limit.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the category of algebras for the bag monad consists of commutative monoids, not all monoids."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/27", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/248794", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/89178/"], "docs_id": 248794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> When I was in high school, a mosquito bite used to be itchy for many\n>  weeks.

Moreover, it says that to know by how much an eigenvalue changes, one needs only to know the derivative of the Hamiltonian operator and the corresponding eigenvector. Is there a more fundamental interpretation at play here that I am missing?\n\nIt gets a bit stranger, when one considers even introducing parameters $\\\\alpha$ into the Hamiltonian, in order to compute average of a term in the Hamiltonian, e.g., writing $H \\= A \\+ B $ instead as $H\\=A\\+\\\\alpha B$ and calculating $E\\_n (\\\\alpha)$ we can express the expectation value of the $B$ terms as:\n$$\n\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial E(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}\\\\right\\|\\_{\\\\alpha\\=1} \\=^{FHT} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\= \\\\langle B \\\\rangle \\\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nWhy by arbitrarily introducing parameters into $H$ we can still estimate the correct expectation values using FHT? I feel I am missing some potentially basic point here.\n\nOn a mathematical side: in Eq. $(1\\),$ the averaging over the eigenstate $\\|\\\\psi\\_n\\\\rangle$ implies that the derivative of $H$ is only valid as long as $H$ is in eigenstates, right? But how can we mathematically compute such derivatives when only eigenstates are allowed? Isn't this similar to attempting to define derivatives over discrete functions?\nHow do we actually compute such derivatives (analytically or numerically)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short answer:** In general, the eigenvectors $\\\\psi\\_n$ will change for finite $\\\\alpha$. Hence, to apply the Feynman Hellman theorem correctly in your second question, you need to determine the spectrum and eigenvectors at $\\\\alpha\\=1$ and then compute expectation values with respect to these eigenvectors. \n\n**Longer answer:** \n\nYou're asking a few different questions here, so let me know if I've missed one. Firstly, on a basic mathematical level it seems that you're asking how to define the derivative of $H$ with respect to a parameter $\\\\alpha$. To do this, you can imagine choosing a fixed basis for the Hilbert space on which $H$ acts, evaluating the matrix elements of $H$ with respect to this basis, and differentiating each matrix element individually. If instead you had chosen a new basis at each value of $\\\\alpha$, you would need to specify a particular *covariant derivative* for the Hamiltonian, to avoid ambiguities associated with your choice of basis at each value of $\\\\alpha$. \n\nYour first question is not entirely clear to me, but I'd guess that you're asking why changes in the eigenvectors are irrelevant for computing $\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha E\\_n(\\\\alpha)$. Essentially this follows from the fact that eigenvectors are constrained to lie on the unit sphere of $\\\\mathbb C^n$ (where $n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space). Explicitly, \n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha E\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle\\+(\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|)H(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle\\+\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|H(\\\\alpha)\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha(\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H\\\\rangle\\_n\\+E\\_n\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha(\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H\\\\rangle\\_n\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nPhysically, it's related to the observation that changing the Hamiltonian of a system slowly over time tends to cause the system to move continuously along an eigenstate (as long as the spectrum is well separated)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian H(\u03b1) that depends on a parameter \u03b1.

Option B is wrong because the derivative should be evaluated at \u03b1 = 1, not 0, when using this method to calculate expectation values. Option C is false because the theorem can be applied even when eigenstates change with \u03b1; in fact, it accounts for this change implicitly.

The result was the same for both. I transmitted from my radio at around 145 MHz. The moment I keyed, I could hear a small click on the earpiece, but nothing more. I couldn't hear myself when I spoke into the microphone.\n\nHere's a picture of the actual circuit:![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzQ1d.jpg)\n\nI believe the diode is a 1N34A.\n\nMy guesses at the problem were impedance mismatch and the lack of a good ground, but I also remember that the only issue that would cause is a weaker signal, and I'm right next to the transmitting station, so I'm not sure if that's the reason I can't hear anything. It's really discouraging to spend money on something that doesn't work, so before I go out to get a grounding rod and a sledgehammer or a huge length of wire for an antenna, are those likely to be the reasons I'm not getting any sound? What else could the problem be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That's a very very very very minimalist circuit and very 'laid back' construction. It will work with a suitably high impedance ear\\-piece and proper construction and enough transmitter power and close proximity and ... ie It MAY work but it's not surprising if it doesn't as there are too many potential pitfalls. \n\n* The earpiece looks like it is low impedance \\- either 8 ohms or perhaps a few hundred ohms. \n\nWithout a tuned circuit you need all the sensitivity and lack of loading that you can get. Use of a very very high impedance \"crystal earpiece\" will make a significant difference.\n* Your general construction is excessively rough for what you are trying to do. You MAY make it work but one bad join may doom it and stability is unlikely.\n* Your wiring lengths and stray capacitance and inductance are long for use at 145 Mhz.\n* As MikeJ\\-UK noted in a comment \\- if your transmitter is FM (frequency modulated) then you will probably not hear anything as the diode acts to \"recover\" or \"demodulate\" the amplitude variations in the carrier wave of an AM (amplitude signal).\n* Adding a tuned circuit at the frequency of interest \\- as seen in almost all crystal set designs you will see, is probably the single best improvement that you can make.\n* Clip leads of the sort you are using usually use crimp construction. They can be high resistance or open circuit or have a thin skim of oxidation at the wire to clip contact so that you need a certain level of current flow before they will conduct. \n\nSoldering the core of the circuit with short lengths of wire is far preferable.\n\nClip leads of the sort shown should **ALWAYS** be soldered at the wire to clip join. Failure to do this will give you many hours of harmless and unproductive fun. When I buy leads like this I put a loose knot in the wire and remove it once the lead has been soldered.\n* The diode **MAY** be a 1N34a. That's a Germanium small signal diode. Rare and not cheap. More usual would be a 1N4148 or 1N916\\. Most small glass diodes are probably OK.

But, if we think about it a little differently...\n\n$$\ny \\= \\\\ln(x) \n \\\\xrightarrow{{x}\\\\ \\\\mapsto\\\\ \\-x} \ny \\= \\\\ln(\\-\\\\color{red}{x}) \n \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\color{red}{x}\\\\ \\\\mapsto\\\\ \\\\color{red}{x \\- 3}}\ny \\= \\\\ln\\\\bigl(\\-(\\\\color{red}{x \\- 3})\\\\bigr) \\= \\\\ln(\\-x \\+ 3\\)\n$$\n\nwhich we recognize as the sequence of transformations 1\\) Flip the graph left/right, and 2\\) Shift to the right 3 units.\n\nThere is an alternative:\n\n$$\ny \\= \\\\ln(x) \n \\\\xrightarrow{x\\\\ \\\\mapsto\\\\ x \\+ 3} \ny \\= \\\\ln(x \\+ 3\\) \n \\\\xrightarrow{x\\\\ \\\\mapsto\\\\ \\-x}\ny \\= \\\\ln(\\-x \\+ 3\\)\n$$\n\nso we see the transformation can also be achieved by 1\\) Shifting the graph $3$ units left, then 2\\) Flipping left and right.\n\n---\n\nSo, long story short: To recognize a graph as the transformation of another graph, you *have* to figure out how to only use substitutions like \"add this to $x$\", or \"make $x$ negative\", not adding things to $\\-x$, or $2x$, etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the function f(x) = log(x), which of the following transformations correctly represents the graph of g(x) = log(5x - 7)?\n\nA) Reflect f(x) over the y-axis, then shift 7 units right and compress horizontally by a factor of 1/5\nB) Shift f(x) 7/5 units right, then stretch horizontally by a factor of 5\nC) Shift f(x) 7/5 units left, then compress horizontally by a factor of 1/5\nD) Reflect f(x) over the y-axis, then shift 7/5 units left and stretch horizontally by a factor of 5\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nTo transform f(x) = log(x) into g(x) = log(5x - 7), we need to break it down into basic transformations:\n\n1) First, we rewrite the inside of the logarithm:\n   5x - 7 = 5(x - 7/5)\n\n2) Now we can recognize the transformations:\n   x \u2192 x - 7/5 : This shifts the graph 7/5 units to the right\n   x \u2192 5x : This compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 1/5\n\n3) However, these transformations are applied from right to left (innermost to outermost). So, we actually:\n   - Shift 7/5 units left (the opposite of the right shift inside the function)\n   - Compress horizontally by 1/5\n\nTherefore, option C is correct. Options A and D incorrectly include a reflection. Option B incorrectly interprets the horizontal transformation as a stretch instead of a compression."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68745", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/7228/"], "docs_id": 68745, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Inverse Function Theorem provides sufficient conditions to determine when a function is defined implicitly by a relation.

This means we need to analyze the Taylor expansion of the relation near (0,0). The leading terms are x^3 and y^3, which are both odd-degree terms. However, when we try to solve for y in terms of x, we get y^3 = 3xy - x^3. The right-hand side has a leading term of -x^3, which is odd. Therefore, y as a function of x would have a leading even-degree term (x^(2/3)). According to the given information, when the leading term is even, the equation is not always solvable in a neighborhood of 0. Thus, an implicit function y = f(x) does not exist in a neighborhood of (0,0)."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/19", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/541043", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/389251/"], "docs_id": 541043, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are research techniques where something is investigated under working conditions, and these techniques are commonly referred to as *in situ*.\n\nFor the sake of being specific to my field of study, investigation of electrode material *in situ* is when the material is studied in the battery that has been put in some static condition (constant voltage applied and the battery cell is in equilibrium).\n\nLately, there is a novel term, \"*operando*,\" which is a more specific \"*in situ*.\" It is a method for studying electrode material in a working cell while the system changes under an external influence. For example, while the battery charges under constant current.\n\nRoughly speaking, *in situ* is for studying the state, *operando* is for studying the process.\n\n**The question is: should \"*operando*\" or \"*in operando*\" be used?**\n\nI tried following the literature to avoid being wrong, but it does not help much. For example, Wikipedia has an article on [operando spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operando_spectroscopy), and there is no \"in\" anywhere in the article. There is also no \"in operando\" page on Wiktionary, only [\"operando\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/operando). However, in research papers things get messy and there is extensive use of \"in operando\", e.g., [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-018-0056-z), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10843-4), [and here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03114-1).

(Magistri, please correct any dubious details in the comments!)\n\nOperando is a gerund, i.e., a verbal noun, recognizable by its form. Gerunds often get translated into English with \"\\-ing\" gerunds, in this case \"operating\" or \"running\".\n\nThe o ending and context indicate that it is in the ablative case, which is a messy, multipurpose category for oblique functions often expressed with prepositions in English. It would be accurate to translate \"operando\" as \"in operation\" or \"while running\" or similar, but this form and meaning do not require the use of a preposition in Latin.\n\nIn contrast we have many phrases that use Latin nouns in the ablative to convey a similar concept (the technical means by which something is accomplished), but they often appear with the preposition \"in\". Why? Those phrases usually are expressing a physical (or figuratively physical) location or state in which something is accomplished (*in vitro* fertilization, *in situ* conservation, *in loco parentis*). For those functions and forms, Latin does use a preposition.\n\nI hope that helps!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In scientific literature, which of the following terms is most appropriate to describe a method for studying electrode material in a working battery cell while the system changes under an external influence (e.g., during charging)?\n\nA) in situ\nB) operando\nC) in operando\nD) in vivo\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) While \"in situ\" is used for studying materials under working conditions, it typically refers to static conditions. This term is not specific enough for the described dynamic process.\n\nB) \"Operando\" is the correct term for studying a system during active operation or while changes are occurring. It's a Latin gerund that doesn't require a preposition and is increasingly used in scientific literature for this purpose.\n\nC) \"In operando\" is sometimes used in literature, but it's grammatically redundant.

I know the ballasts get warm Although I never touched one directly while it was on. I have left the cover off as one cannot see the fixture. Does the temperature seem excessive ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think your PSU should be fine as far as the undervoltage is concerned. After all, what it does is use a transformer to step down high voltage to something lower than then uses switching converters to step it even lower to regulate. If anything your PSU would just brownout, not fry. Not to mention it is rated as low as 100V.\n\nThat said, a slow multi\\-meter won't display line spikes that would actually damage your PSU. You need an oscilloscope that graphs the voltage for that. By spike, I do not mean a rise to normal voltage levels. I mean a rise above normal levels. But an electric heater should be mostly resistive not very inductive to begin with to produce voltage spikes higher than the line voltage.\n\nIf you are worried that your PSU's *line regulation* might not be fast enough to react to the rise in input voltage after extended low input voltage and result in too high of a voltage on the output, I wouldn't be too concerned since there are massive output capacitors that can buffer that. It's probably enough to keep your computer on even when lights off then on flicker off. (maybe 1/5th of a second? Certainly 1/10th from my experience)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A computer technician is concerned about potential damage to a power supply unit (PSU) due to voltage fluctuations from an electric heater.

The documentation indicates that PSUs are designed to handle a range of input voltages (as low as 100V in this case) and have features like input transformers and output capacitors that help manage voltage fluctuations. The PSU is more likely to brownout than be damaged by undervoltage, and its massive output capacitors can buffer brief changes in input voltage. While option C raises a valid concern, the presence of these capacitors mitigates this risk. Option A is incorrect as undervoltage is more likely to cause a brownout than damage. Option B is incorrect because a standard multimeter cannot detect rapid voltage spikes that might be harmful; an oscilloscope would be needed for that."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/20", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/167621", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/95499/"], "docs_id": 167621, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w05zb.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w05zb.jpg)My nest was installed with no c wire and it lost power.

An alternative viewpoint is to partition $S^2$ by these planes moved to the center of that sphere. Within each cell of this arrangement of great circles on $S^2$, the area of the projection changes in a regular, computable manner (as a function of coordinates on $S^2$). None of this would be easy to implement, but it is computable in roughly $O(n^2\\)$ time for a 3\\-polytope of $n$ vertices. (Note here I am using $n$ for the number of vertices, and assuming you are working in $R^3$, whereas in Robby McKilliam's posting, $n$ is the dimension).\n\nFor this arrangements viewpoint, see the paper by Michael McKenna and Raimund Seidel,\n\"Finding the optimal shadows of a convex polytope,\"\n[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\\=323237](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=323237) ."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the method described for calculating projections of a convex polytope, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the computational complexity and approach?\n\nA) The method has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of vertices, and involves partitioning R\u00b3 using the polytope's faces.\n\nB) The approach requires partitioning S\u00b2 using great circles, with a time complexity of O(n\u00b2) where n is the number of vertices in R\u00b3.\n\nC) The algorithm involves arranging planes in R\u00b3 determined by the polytope's edges, with a complexity of O(n\u00b3) where n is the dimension of the space.\n\nD) The method partitions R\u00b2 using the polytope's projections, with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of faces.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The gazebo is 10'x12' and the deck is 12'x16'. The frame is light gauge hollow steel thats powder\\-coated. The frame slants up from the sides to a small canopy for ventilation. The top is water resistant and flame retardant.\n\nShortly after putting it up we got some strong thunderstorms and I wondered if this steel frame (comes to a point about 9' high) sitting on a wooden deck would be attractive to lightning? Also I realized that we have a mostly stainless steel grill on casters and attached to a natural gas line that runs out of the basement. The line in some type of heavy rubber or plastic tubing. Don't know if it's flexible metal on the inside. A Gas Co. guy came out and checked and approved the connection, but didn't mention anything about grounding it.\n\nSo the question is should either or both be grounded and how should it be done? We do have some tall trees about 15\\-20' from the deck. Maybe they would be more likely to be struck and i am over\\-reacting? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If lighting hits an ungrounded metal structure, it will usually branch out at the bottom of the structure, following multiple paths between the structure and the ground. Some of those paths may be horizontal for a considerable distance. \n It will burn, explode, and/or electrocute anything in the way. [Grounding a metal structure makes it safer](https://www.rhinobldg.com/how-pre-engineered-metal-buildings-resist-lightning-damage/).\n\nHowever, surviving a direct lightning strike takes a lot more than just a single copper rod in the ground. To do it right, you'll need a soil analysis and a network of grounding rods that are bonded together. I think a better idea is to stay away from the gazebo (and the deck for that matter) when there's lightning in the area."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has installed a metal-framed gazebo on their wooden deck and is concerned about lightning strikes.

A comprehensive grounding system (option C) would be more effective, but it's complex and may not guarantee complete safety. Relying on nearby trees (option B) is not a reliable strategy.

SAS drives, typically running at 10k or 15k RPM, can perform more I/O operations per second compared to SATA drives (usually 7200 RPM). This is crucial for VM performance, especially in environments where multiple VMs are running per drive.

It will also accept a command line argument (described later under **Optional pattern matching argument**).\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d','-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\nelse:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d',\\\n            '-name',sys.argv[1], '-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\ncounts = []\nfor name in folder:\n    counts.append(sum(name in i[:len(name)] for i in folder))\ncounts = sorted(list(zip(counts,folder)),reverse=True)\nif counts[0][0]>1:\n    sys.stdout.buffer.write(counts[0][1]+b'\\x0a')\n\n```\n\nSave the script (e.g. as `mainfoldername.py` or whatever) and the command `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output the folder name that meets the criteria of occuring most often as the starting string in folder names in the current working directory. If no folders meet that criteria, the script produces no output.\n\nWith the example directories you've given, `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output **`./Target.Dire ctoryName`**.\n\nUsing **command expansion**, a variable can be set to the script's output value and used in other commands:\n\n```\n$ myvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n$ echo \"$myvar\"\n./Target.Dire ctoryName\n$ cd \"$myvar\"\nTarget.Dire ctoryName$\n\n```\n\nShell script usage\n------------------\n\nIn **shell scripts** that will use this output, a check for cases where no folder names met the criteria (i.e. the python script produced no output) should be included by testing the value for zero length, e.g:\n\n```bsh\n#!/bin/sh\nmyvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n[ ! -z \"$myvar\" ] || exit 1\n\n```\n\nOptional pattern matching argument\n----------------------------------\n\n`python3 /path/to/mainfolder.py PATTERN`\n\nThis script will accept one optional argument on the command line where *`PATTERN`* is a shell pattern that folder names must match.\n\nThe most basic use of this is as a switch between finding regular folders or finding hidden folders. The script's default behavior is to find all folders.\n\n**To find only hidden folders**, use **`'.*'`** for *`PATTERN`*:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '.*'\n\n```\n\n**To find only non\\-hidden folders**, use **`'[!\\.]*'`**\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '[!\\.]*'\n\n```\n\nIt's also useful when you know some string that will appear in the target folder's name.\n\n**To find only folders whose names contain the string `Target`**:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '*Target*'\n\n```\n\nNote that the patterns should always be contained in quotes to avoid expansion by the shell.

What are your experiences and advice concerning the following dilemmas?\n\nBeing limited to a rate of 4\\-5 courses per semester, I realize that I am certainly not going to be able to take all of the courses that I am interested in. I would like to get a build a broad and solid base of knowledge by studying all areas of math at least a bit, but this comes at a cost of being able to take the more advanced, deeper courses. My plan was to self\\-study measure theory/Banach spaces and topology this year so that I'll be able to immerse myself in the graduate\\-level courses, which I expect to be more challenging and interesting and rewarding. I was wondering if people had experiences/regrets/wisdom about whether or not this is a good idea?
