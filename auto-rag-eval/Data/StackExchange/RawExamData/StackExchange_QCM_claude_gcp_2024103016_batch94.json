Real-world examples: Case studies provide concrete examples of how SharePoint has been used to solve similar business problems, making it easier for the client to envision how it could work for their organization.\n\n2. Addressing specific needs: By selecting relevant case studies, you can highlight how SharePoint addresses the client's primary concerns of document access, sharing, management, and creating a public-facing website.\n\n3. Demonstrating versatility: Case studies can showcase various \"cool things\" that can be done with SharePoint, giving the client ideas for future expansion.\n\n4.

I also thought the line of redstone above \nthem might be the problem (middle of above pic), but when I destroy it, the pistons stay extended.\n\nIs there a reason why my pistons are extending? If so, is there a way to get them to power (when I want them to) without disturbing the pistons above?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are experiencing quasi\\-connectivity. You have actually produced a BUD (Block update detector).\n\nThe power source is the redstone line above. I have built an example to demonstrate.\n\nHere it is unpowered and then powered(but not updated):\n[![First](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eShln.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eShln.jpg)\n\nHere I updated the block by adding glass, then removed glass and power:\n[![Second](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D5Z0q.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D5Z0q.jpg)\n\nHere I removed all the remaining blocks and it still doesn't update.

I removed that when piston was powered. Unpowered would have updated piston and it would have retracted.\n\nUnfortunately you will have to go with a different circuit design. One possible change would be to use direct power instead of inversion of the signal to invert all the torches. Run a line directly behind/next to pistons.\n\nHere is an example:\n[![Example](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSmEs.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSmEs.jpg)\n\nIf you want to understand how it is being powered in this way, the wiki has a [tutorial on quasi\\-connectivity](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Minecraft, you're building a large-scale hard drive and encounter an issue where pistons are extending unexpectedly. What is the most likely cause of this behavior, and what solution would allow you to control the pistons as intended?\n\nA) The redstone torches nearby are malfunctioning. Replace all redstone torches with repeaters.\n\nB) There's a bug in Minecraft causing random piston activations. Report the issue to Mojang and wait for a patch.\n\nC) The pistons are experiencing quasi-connectivity, creating a BUD (Block Update Detector). Redesign the circuit to use direct power instead of inversion.\n\nD) The pistons are being powered by adjacent redstone dust. Remove all redstone dust near the pistons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue described is a classic example of quasi-connectivity in Minecraft. This phenomenon causes pistons to receive power from blocks diagonally above them, even when not directly connected. This creates a BUD (Block Update Detector) effect, where pistons remain extended until receiving a block update. \n\nThe solution is to redesign the circuit to avoid quasi-connectivity. Using direct power instead of inverted signals (as suggested in the answer) would allow for more predictable piston behavior. This approach ensures the pistons are only activated when intended, solving the unexpected extension problem while still allowing for controlled activation when desired.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they misidentify the source of the problem.

Therefore, each prime is identified by a point $P(k,d)$. \n\nI illustrate this representation in the following scheme.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFOv0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFOv0.png)\n\nFor instance, in correspondence of the column $k\\=15$ ($x$\\-axis), we find two points in the rows $d\\=1$ and $d\\=7$ ($y$\\-axis), because $15\\\\cdot 10\\+1\\=151$ and $15\\\\cdot 10\\+7\\=157$ are primes.\n\nWithin this reference system, we can introduce the function \n\n$$\nf\\_1(k)\\=5\\+4\\\\cos(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}(k\\-1\\)),\n$$\n\nwhich pass through some of the points representing the primes (green).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCLPM.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCLPM.png)\n\nSimilarly, we can introduce the function\n\n$$\nf\\_2(k)\\=5\\+4\\\\cos(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}(k\\-2\\)),\n$$\n\nwhich pass (blue) through some *other* primes, with respect to the ones related to $f\\_1$:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Aqx7.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Aqx7.png)\n\nConversely, the (orange) function \n\n$$\nf\\_3(k)\\=5\\+4\\\\cos(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}(k\\-3\\)),\n$$\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLjkc.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLjkc.png)\n\npass through *some* primes related to the green function $f\\_2$ (in correspondence of $d\\=3$).\n\nHowever, by means of $6$ functions in the form $f\\_h(k)\\=5\\+4\\\\cos(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}(k\\-h))$, with $h\\=1,2,3,4,5,6$ we are able to intercept all the primes:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K5Ulg.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K5Ulg.png)\n\nMy question rises from the fact that there is a sort of \"multiplicity\" of some primes, since they are reached by more than one function.

In your case go to Windhelmand search for Calder.\n\nThere is the possibility that having loaded a safe that was and playing without installing the DLC might have deleted your followers inventory.\n\nIf this doesn't work I believe that loading an old safe will do but if you lack one there is always the possibility to try and port your current safe to PC and using console bring back Calder.Keep in mind that this is not easy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Skyrim game on PS3 where a follower has disappeared after reinstalling DLC, which of the following methods is most likely to resolve the issue without losing significant game progress?\n\nA) Complete a quest that forces a companion change, such as \"The Fallen\" or \"Proving Honor\", then wait for 1-2 weeks of in-game time before checking the follower's original location\n\nB) Repeatedly commit minor crimes to get arrested and serve jail time\n\nC) Uninstall and reinstall all DLC again, then load the most recent save\n\nD) Port the current save to PC and use console commands to bring back the follower\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is the most practical and likely to succeed without risking further issues. Completing a quest that forces a companion change (like those listed in the image) can reset the follower system. Waiting 1-2 weeks of in-game time allows for any background processes to complete, and checking the original location (Windhelm for Calder) gives the best chance of recovering the follower.\n\nOption B (jail time) was already attempted by the user without success.

By inheriting from BaseSetupController and overriding the LoadData method, we can track when it's called while still maintaining the original functionality. This approach ensures that the ViewLoaded event is properly wired up to the LoadData method in the constructor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because mocking BaseSetupController will not test the actual implementation, including the event subscription in the constructor.\n\nOption B is flawed because it creates both a real instance and a mock, which doesn't accurately test the behavior.\n\nOption D is overly complex and relies on reflection, which is generally not recommended for unit testing as it's fragile and can break with code changes."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/18", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/2639", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 2639, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I completely suck at DotA (though I am somewhat familiar with Nevermore); I can never kill any enemy heroes even on easy. What strategies can I use to defeat enemy heroes?\n\nI do the basics: get last hit to get cash and that's pretty much all I know. I buy the trent boots which are set to agility. The first two things I buy are a courier and the reg with \\+5 hp regen. I then get that sword with critical hits and upgrade it after getting demon's edge.\n\nI still suck and can't kill enemy heroes even though I have \\+130 damage (or more). What can I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Nevermore is actually one of the more powerful heroes there are a couple things you should know about him:\n\nStaying alive: Nevermore's damage is largely proportional to how many last hits you got since you last died. So stay alive! You're going to need Lother (which turns your invisible) or Kelen's (which teleports you) to do this, so after boots (str or phase) this is your first pick up.\n\nCombo: because you have 3 shadowrase, you need to cast it more than once to kill. Figure out the middle range usage (hint its the same range as your basic attack) and then follow up with short (if he comes after you) or long (if he runs away). You can also combo it to get more kills.\n\nRequim: This skill trades on being right next to your target, so combo it with Lother or Kelen's for maximum effectiveness.\n\nAbility build:\n\n1. Necromasty (to start grouping up your last hits)\n2. Shadowraze (lvl 1 isn't great, so hold off on it\n3. Shadowraze (Your combo is starting to get good)\n4. Necromasty\n5. Shadowraze (by now your combo is leathal)\n6. Requim\n7. Shadowraze\n8. Necromasty\n9. Necromasty\n10\\+ you want to max out Requim then Presence of the Dark lord\n\nDamage: Most of your early game kills revolve around Shadowraze, but once you get to mid game you're going to want to pick up some dps. Demons Edge is very nice, as is Manta Style (with bonus to survive). Stygian is going to be essential in late game as it stacks with your Presence. Nevermore doesn't trade on his life steal, but Mask of Madness' on use ability is nasty. I usually go for Demon's Edge \\-\\> Stygian \\-\\> Buriza. If you're still looking for items after that Skadi or Satanic are both good, but you should be in end game by then.\n\n---\n\nOk, it sounds like you have a larger problem than working well with Nevermore, that extends to DotA in general. \n\nA carry is a late game hero who can push a lane and take out 3\\-4 opposing heroes with little support. A Hard carry is a character who needs to farm up all game specifically for late game. A Soft carry is a player who doesn't have a ton of late game abilities but can become very powerful late game due to ganking.\n\nGanking is a term for going into an ally's lane and helping to kill their enemy. This technique usually relies on surprise and coordination. Ganking is useful for all heroes as nearby heroes split the xp of a kill and the last hit gains significant gold. Agility based heroes usually operate as glass cannons early on, so ganking is a way to gain experience and gold with minimal risk (the risk usually being getting ganked).\n\nNevermore's ganking technique usually relies on casting shadowraze back to back. Ideally you can get an ally to stun the target and there fore get off all 3 shadowraze. Once you hit level 6, if you have full Necromasty use your lothar's to get right on top of an opponent and Ult. Follow this up immediately with shadowraze (remember to attack first so you're pointed in the right direction, but don't wait for the attack to go off). The target should be low and try to run. Just dps him down till he's in range of your next shadowraze and enjoy the kill.\n\nFarming is another technique to get to late game with an agility hero. Nevermore is especially good at farming in his own lane (known as laning) because of shadowraze. Adjust your range to be ideal for mid\\-range shadowraze (you can do this by attacking). Wait till the last one of your melee creeps is about to die then cast shadowraze. This should kill some of them and injure the rest. When they come into melee range your second shadowraze will finish them off. This is excellent farming technique, but very mana intensive so stock up on consumables."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided DotA documentation:\n\nQuestion: As Nevermore in DotA, which of the following ability builds and item progressions would be most effective for maximizing early game kills and transitioning into a strong late-game carry?\n\nA) Ability build: Necromasty (1) -> Presence of the Dark Lord (2-5) -> Shadowraze (6-9) -> Requiem (10)\n   Item progression: Boots -> Mask of Madness -> Demon's Edge -> Buriza\n\nB) Ability build: Shadowraze (1-4) -> Necromasty (5-8) -> Requiem (6, 10) -> Presence of the Dark Lord (9)\n   Item progression: Boots -> Lothar's Edge -> Demon's Edge -> Stygian Desolator\n\nC) Ability build: Necromasty (1, 4) -> Shadowraze (2, 3, 5, 7) -> Requiem (6) -> Presence of the Dark Lord (8-10)\n   Item progression: Boots -> Kelen's Dagger -> Manta Style -> Skadi\n\nD) Ability build: Necromasty (1, 4) -> Shadowraze (2, 3, 5, 7) -> Requiem (6, 10-11) -> Presence of the Dark Lord (8-9)\n   Item progression: Boots -> Lothar's Edge/Kelen's Dagger -> Demon's Edge -> Stygian Desolator -> Buriza\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D provides the most effective ability build and item progression for Nevermore. The ability build focuses on Necromasty early for last hits, then Shadowraze for damage and farming, with Requiem at level 6 for ganking potential. This build maximizes Shadowraze early while still getting value from other abilities. The item progression starts with mobility/escape (Lothar's or Kelen's) for survival, then builds into high damage items (Demon's Edge, Stygian, Buriza) which synergize well with Nevermore's kit. This combination allows for effective early game kills through Shadowraze combos and Requiem, while scaling well into the late game with high damage output."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/22", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68567", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/4102/"], "docs_id": 68567, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose we have a\n[combinatorial bracelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracelet_(combinatorics)) composed of natural numbers. \n\n(Two bracelets are equivalent if you can get from one to the other via rotation or reflection.)\n\nWhat is the number of different bracelets whose elements sum up to a previously fixed natural number N?\n\nAlso, are there any results if we add a constraint that the number of beads on the bracelet is always odd?\n\nP.S.

This is because there's a bijection between the two, except for the all-plus bracelet which doesn't correspond to any partition. So we add 1 to get the number of two-color bracelets, which is equivalent to using the formula for two-color bracelets of length N + 1.\n\n2) For N = 7, there are 14 two-color bracelets of length 8. Subtracting 1 gives us 13 partition bracelets summing to 7.\n\n3) To ensure an odd number of terms in each partition bracelet, we need to restrict to an odd number of commas in the corresponding two-color bracelet. This is because each comma in the two-color representation separates terms in the partition, so an odd number of commas results in an odd number of terms."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/02/27", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/16600", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/5730/"], "docs_id": 16600, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Why do elliptic curves have bad reduction at some point if they are defined over Q, but not necessarily over arbitrary number fields?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here are two answers:\n\n(a) If you try to write down an elliptic curve $y^2 \\= x^3 \\+ a x \\+ b$ with everywhere good reduction, you need to choose $a$ and $b$ such that $4a^3 \\+ 27 b^2 \\= $ a unit.

Use #import <TapkuLibrary/TapkuLibrary.h>\n\nD) Set the header search path to the library's \"src\" folder, leave the \"recursive\" option unchecked, and use #import <TapkuLibrary/TapkuLibrary.h>\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach involves several key steps:\n\n1. The header search path should be set to the path of the library's top-level folder, which can be relative to the project directory (e.g., \"./../../../TapkuLibrary\") or an absolute path.\n2. It's recommended to set the \"recursive\" option for the header search path. This can be done by checking the box on the left when double-clicking the Header Search Paths field, or by adding \"/***\" to the end of the path.\n3. When importing the library in code, use quotation marks instead of angle brackets: #import \"TapkuLibrary/TapkuLibrary.h\". Angle brackets are typically used for system frameworks, while quotation marks are used for user frameworks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses angle brackets in the import statement. Option C is wrong because it doesn't set header search paths, which are necessary. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't set the recursive option and uses angle brackets in the import statement."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/19", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112867", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/166043/"], "docs_id": 112867, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So as I've seen this way of answering a few times since I started to use SE, I was wondering if answering a question in the form of another question is really a good thing.

accessing the \"Manage Categories\" section under the catalog menu. The error message indicates \"Table 'magento.admin_menutop' doesn't exist\". What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The Magento version is outdated and needs to be upgraded to the latest version.\nB) There is a mismatch between the SQL setup version and the core_resource table entries.\nC) The hosting environment on Digital Ocean is incompatible with Magento 1.9.2.2 CE.\nD) The admin user doesn't have sufficient permissions to access the category management section.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is a mismatch between the SQL setup version and the core_resource table entries. This can occur when an extension was previously installed and then removed improperly. The core_resource table may still contain an entry for the extension, but the actual database tables have been deleted. When the same extension is reinstalled, it skips the installation of the base tables because the core_resource entry exists, leading to errors when the code tries to access non-existent tables. This explanation aligns with the SQL error message and the context provided in the StackExchange answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while version upgrades can solve some issues, this specific error is not typically related to an outdated Magento version. Option C is unlikely as Digital Ocean is a common hosting platform for Magento and version 1.9.2.2 CE is not known to have inherent compatibility issues with it. Option D is incorrect because insufficient permissions would typically result in an access denied error, not a missing table error."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/10", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/486370", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/40892/"], "docs_id": 486370, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Usually log messages are written to stderr. I'm wondering if it is a good idea/practice to split log messages so that errors and warnings go to stderr while debug/informational/notice messages go to stdout instead? Or is this irrelevant given that many dedicated logging processes only read from stdin anyway, which requires source log messages in stderr and stdout be combined and redirect to logger's stdin. \n\n\\[Update]\n\nThe two answers below both mentioned syslog, I think I need to clarify the setup in detail. \n\nThe daemon processes I asked are running in foreground by themselves. Daemonization is managed by supervising processes such as `runit` or `supervisord`. In both cases, the stderr and stdout of the daemon processes will be captured by the supervising processes, and it's the supervising processes' job to decide how and where to store the logs (might be syslog, or somewhere else in the network over UDP). The daemon processes don't have to worry about what and where to write logs, as they just write to stdout/stderr. \n\nIn the case of `runit`, its logging facility `svlogd` will read from its stdin for the redirected log messages, which are combined stderr/stdout of the managed daemon process. As for `supervisord`, it can record stderr and stdout to separate log files. \n\nSo in this specific settings, is it a good practice to split logs between stderr and stdout, or just write to one of them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, something important to clarify: `STDOUT` and `STDERR` are rarely relevant within the context of a daemon process once it has successfully started, unless you're invoking one with a debugging switch.\n\nThe whole point of a daemon is that it needs to disassociate itself from having a controlling terminal, so that it can persist after logout. Once there is no terminal, all messages need to be sent to either a syslog daemon or a log file managed directly by the process.\n\nIf you are not actually referring to daemons, and really just mean any shell script or similar that you're writing yourself, then the logic should generally be this:\n\n* `STDOUT`: Anything you want being trapped by pipes or basic output redirection.\n* `STDERR`: \"Out of band\" messages. Things you want hitting someone's terminal anyway, even if they're doing some kind of redirection. (hence why they're associated with errors) Let the user decide if they also want to redirect these messages as well, i.e. redirecting `STDERR` to `STDIN` as you mentioned."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating a logging system for a set of daemon processes managed by supervisord.

The question specifies that supervisord is responsible for managing the daemon processes and can record stderr and stdout to separate log files. By writing all log messages to stdout, the daemon processes don't need to worry about log destination or splitting messages. This approach simplifies the logging process and allows supervisord to handle log management, including potential redirection or separate file storage.

Option D goes against the described setup where the daemon processes are expected to write to stdout/stderr, leaving log handling to the supervising process."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/18", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/76360", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/11915/"], "docs_id": 76360, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using a [Basys 2](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=BASYS2) with 72Kbits of dual\\-port block RAM.

When Xilinx successfully synthesizes dual-port block RAM, the synthesis report will show a single RAM type (Block) with detailed specifications for both Port A and Port B. This includes information such as aspect ratio, mode (e.g., write-first), clock signals, write enable, address inputs, data inputs, and data outputs for each port. The report will also indicate that it's implemented as a BLOCK RAM, absorbing any relevant registers.

Any consecutive string of token delimiters is converted into a single `<space>` before your command is actually executed in a new CMD thread using command line semantics. The list of token delimiters is `,` `;` `=` `<space>` `<non-breaking space>` and `<tab>`.\n\nSo quoting the command will eliminate the syntax error:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A \"RND=%%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1\"') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nAs will escaping the `=`:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A RND^=%%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nBut you don't really need to assign the random number to a variable. The FOR IN() command is executed within a command line context, and SET /A will print the computed value to stdout when run within a command line context. So the following also eliminates any syntax error with effectively the same results:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A %%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nHere is a simpler method to give a result from 1 to 5 (random mod 5 \\+ 1\\):\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A %%RANDOM%% %% 5 + 1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nBut I seriously doubt any of the above fixes give your desired result.\n\nThere is something very peculiar going on with the value of `%RANDOM%`. Your use of `%%RANDOM%%` properly causes the expression to be evaluated each iteration. But for some reason, the random number is nearly constant for any given run. Once in a while, one of the iterations will vary, but for most runs, each iteration gets a constant value. I think it must have something to do with the random number generator seed value. Perhaps the random number generator is initiated with a seed value each time a CMD session starts, and the seed value is only changing very slowly. Remember that the FOR IN() clause is executed in a new CMD session.\n\nHere is a test program that demonstrates that the `%%test%%` is properly getting re\\-evaluated each iteration. It also shows how `%%random%%` is remaining nearly constant within a run.\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal\nset test=0\nfor /l %%I in (1 1 5) do for /f \"delims=\" %%J in ('echo %%test%% %%random%%') do (\n  echo %%J\n  set \"test=%%I\n)\n\n```\n\nHere is the output from 2 runs of the above code. Note how the 1st run has one variation in the random number. The 2nd run has a constant random value.\n\n```\nC:\\test> test\n0 20369\n1 20373\n2 20373\n3 20373\n4 20373\n\nC:\\test> test\n0 20379\n1 20379\n2 20379\n3 20379\n4 20379\n\n```\n\nThere really is no reason to put the random number computation within a FOR /F IN('command') clause. Everything is much simpler if you use SET /A with delayed expansion directly within your outer loop.\n\nI believe the following may be what you are looking for:\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal enableDelayedExpansion\nSET SOME[1]=\"AA\"\nSET SOME[2]=\"BB\"\nSET SOME[3]=\"CC\"\nSET SOME[4]=\"DD\"\nSET SOME[5]=\"EE\"\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO (\n  set /a rand=!random!%%5+1\n  for %%N in (!rand!) do echo %%i: SOME[%%N]=!SOME[%%N]!\n)\n\n```\n\nHere is some sample output:\n\n```\nC:\\test>test\n1: SOME[3]=\"CC\"\n2: SOME[5]=\"EE\"\n3: SOME[2]=\"BB\"\n4: SOME[2]=\"BB\"\n5: SOME[5]=\"EE\"\n\n```\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHere is better evidence that the randomizer for CMD session is reseeded, and the seed changes only slowly.\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal enableDelayedExpansion\n\necho Within a single CMD session, every ^^!random^^! gets a new value.\nfor /l %%N in (1 1 10) do call echo !time! !random! !random!\n\necho(\n\nsetlocal disableDelayedExpansion\necho But each CMD session !random! is reseeded,\necho and the seed only changes once per second,\necho and the inital value changes slowly:\nfor /l %%N in (1 1 30) do cmd /v:on /c \"echo !time! !random! !random!&for /l %%A in (1 1 50000) do @rem\"\n\n```\n\n\\-\\-OUTPUT\\-\\-\n\n```\nWithin a single CMD session, every !random! gets a new value.\n11:12:10.37 17810 1733\n11:12:10.37 8919 24464\n11:12:10.37 9931 2137\n11:12:10.37 28574 16630\n11:12:10.37 30379 23234\n11:12:10.37 22410 31740\n11:12:10.38 15479 14080\n11:12:10.38 812 23616\n11:12:10.38 1384 25909\n11:12:10.38 2733 1947\n\nBut each CMD session !random! is reseeded,\nand the seed only changes once per second,\nand the inital value changes slowly:\n11:12:10.39 4552 6316\n11:12:10.50 4552 6316\n11:12:10.61 4552 6316\n11:12:10.71 4552 6316\n11:12:10.82 4552 6316\n11:12:10.92 4552 6316\n11:12:11.03 4555 17064\n11:12:11.14 4555 17064\n11:12:11.24 4555 17064\n11:12:11.35 4555 17064\n11:12:11.45 4555 17064\n11:12:11.56 4555 17064\n11:12:11.67 4555 17064\n11:12:11.77 4555 17064\n11:12:11.88 4555 17064\n11:12:11.99 4555 17064\n11:12:12.09 4559 27813\n11:12:12.20 4559 27813\n11:12:12.30 4559 27813\n11:12:12.41 4559 27813\n11:12:12.51 4559 27813\n11:12:12.62 4559 27813\n11:12:12.73 4559 27813\n11:12:12.83 4559 27813\n11:12:12.94 4559 27813\n11:12:13.04 4562 5793\n11:12:13.15 4562 5793\n11:12:13.26 4562 5793\n11:12:13.36 4562 5793\n11:12:13.47 4562 5793\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Windows batch script, you want to generate random numbers between 1 and 5 and use them to access array elements.

To do this, I want to estimate the savings we realized by using an open source web application rather than building it from scratch or buying a COTS solution.

Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for a really simple way to do this without going through a full estimation process. \n\nSince I have the source code, I would think there should be some heuristic that could give me a very rough estimate of developer hours needed to write it.

Considering only those two factors, it makes no difference when you put the beers in your fridge.\n\nHowever, because you say that your fridge is in use in the intervening time, you should also consider how the fridge behaves when you open it. When you open the door, it trades some air with the outside. When you close the door, it cools down the \"new\" air. If you put the beers in the fridge, there is less air in it and consequently less new air after opening and closing the door. (It may be more important that the beer blocks air currents, but the effect is the same.) So your beer actually makes the fridge slightly more resilient when the door is opened and closed.\n\nFor completeness, though, if you open the door long enough to significantly warm up the beer, then you could do yourself some harm because the beer will take more energy to cool down than the same volume of room temperature air, but I estimate that you would have to leave the door open a lot for that to happen: As long as the air heating up the beer stays in the fridge, it is that much less heat energy that the fridge needs to pump back out when the door is closed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A refrigerator contains several items and is in regular use. You have a six-pack of room temperature beer that you want to cool for later consumption. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the energy efficiency of cooling the beer?\n\nA) It's more energy efficient to wait until just before consumption to put the beer in the fridge, as this minimizes the time the fridge needs to maintain the beer's cold temperature.\n\nB) It's more energy efficient to put the beer in the fridge immediately, as the beer's thermal mass helps stabilize the fridge's internal temperature during door openings.\n\nC) The timing of when you put the beer in the fridge has no impact on energy efficiency, as the energy required to cool the beer is constant regardless of when it's added.\n\nD) It's more energy efficient to cool the beer outside the fridge first (e.g., in a cooler with ice) before transferring it to the refrigerator.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While it's true that the energy required to cool the beer itself remains constant, putting the beer in the fridge immediately provides a slight energy advantage. The beer's presence in the fridge reduces the volume of air that needs to be re-cooled each time the door is opened. Additionally, the beer's mass can help block air currents, making the fridge more resilient to temperature changes during door openings. This effect slightly reduces the overall energy consumption of the refrigerator during its regular use. \n\nOption A is incorrect because waiting doesn't provide any energy benefit and may actually be less efficient due to more air needing to be cooled after door openings. \n\nOption C is partially true regarding the energy to cool the beer itself, but it doesn't account for the efficiency gains in regular fridge operation. \n\nOption D introduces an unnecessary step that would likely use more energy overall and doesn't take advantage of the beer's potential to stabilize the fridge's internal environment."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/12/26", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/265540", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/50222/"], "docs_id": 265540, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I find a period of this function?\n\n$$2\\\\sin{3x} \\+ 3\\\\sin{2x}$$\n\nIs here any way how to sum both sinuses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One has period $\\\\pi$ and the other has period $2\\\\pi /3$.

But either way, it requires a truly absurd amount of printing for it to be triggered, and i doubt you have that many files loading.\n\nAnyways, if your intent with the `System.out.println(\"Loading \"+original+\"...\");` line is for a permanent/production logging, rather than something you've put on code just temporarily for development/debug purposes, then you are better off with a proper `Logger`. You can read a TL;DR version of instructions in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16448421/1253136), and you can read further, including the official documentation, through the links provided there.\n\n---\n\nThe other cause, which is quite certainly your's, is that you are having too much data loaded at the same time. The solutions are to either:\n\n1. Scale down the images (make thumbnails), and only show the full\\-size version for the selected image. Please note tough, that this is a fast solution method, and is **not recommended!** As it might still be too much for the system to withstand.\n2.

It addresses the core issue by only loading the images that are currently visible in the interface, dynamically loading new images and unloading others as the user navigates.

Datacenter design *can* be a speciality, and at a scale above a couple thousand square feet probably *is* a speciality, but does have a set of topics that a system administrator can be reasonably expected to know.\n\nThe Larger Story\n================\n\nA system administrator is a generalist knowledge domain. Some sysadmins tend to focus on one thing versus another thing, and no sysadmin really looks like another. However it is self evident that a sysadmin will be working on switches, routers, databases, server OSs, firmware, hardware replacement, wiring, VOIP, firewalls, storage, HPC clusters, threat mitigation, PCI compliance, wireless signals, mobile phones, etc. and etc.\n\nEach of the above topic domains *can* be specialized in to such a degree that a person that does so might not be considered a sysadmin. Someone who is a VOIP engineer is... just that. A VOIP engineer. Not a sysadmin. Someone that is a storage administrator can have a depth of knowledge and a tightly scoped domain of responsibility that makes them... just that. A storage administrator. Not a sysadmin.\n\nI like to use database administrators as an example. A sysadmin, in the course of performing his duties, will have a high probability of working with databases. Maybe it's as simple as spinning up a MySQL database for a Cacti instance. Maybe it's as complex as working with replication, sharding, split tables, indexing, and query execution plans for a large application. However, there are also database administrators (DBAs) as a separate professional arena. DBAs are specialists in their field (or at least *should* be) and due to their constant exposure to databases and the theories and practices behind information storage and retrieval in a relational database, will have a honed domain of knowledge and speciality that is beyond a sysadmin's (typically... or perhaps *ideally* if not typically). They are no longer sysadmins, but DBAs.\n\nNow some sysadmins might have never, ever touched a database server. Never ran an SQL query. Never worked with anything more complex than a spreadsheet. Does that make them less of a sysadmin? No. However, *just because they have never used a RDBMS does not mean that someone who has done so is a specialist and that the general skillset of database administration is outside the realm of a sysadmin.*\n\nIn a similar manner, datacenter design and management has the *potential* to be within the scope of a sysadmin. Topics like rack design, rack placement, hot and cold aisles, concrete floors, raised floors, cable plant management, ceiling types, AC sizing, AC duct placement, circuit sizing, electric voltage selection, fire retardants, physical security, generators, etc. and etc. *can* be part of a sysadmin's duties. It could be for a 100 square foot closet. It could be for a 1,000 square foot room or perhaps larger. If it gets much larger than 1,000 square feet, then it seems that a specialist company and set of engineers should be consulted to do the main design phase, with input from sysadmins (thus, sysadmins would still be at least a *part* of the design process, thus datacenter design and management would still be within scope of a sysadmin).\n\nOnce you get past a certain arbitrary level of knowledge, job description, and daily duties, then somewhere along the line you become a DC manager or DC designer, in much the same way that at some point along the line you would become a DBA and not a SysAdmin, or a storage admin, or a security specialist, or a VOIP engineer, etc.\n\nI've made a mockup Venn diagram that shows my thoughts (yes, this is my opinion and not based on any empirical research; this is purely my experience in the field):\n\n![Venn digram of sysadmin skills](https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeREz.png)\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nAspects of datacenter design are on topic for ServerFault and sysadmins in general. We should not consider a speciality community just yet. Yes, I know we quibble about the fracturing of StackExchange into Security, DBAs, U\\&L, etc. However, that's another topic. For now, while we don't have a specialist community for Datacenter designers and managers, it's still on topic here just like database administration and UNIX/Linux questions are, within a certain scope, on topic as well.\n\nAddendum 1\n==========\n\nIain brings up a good point: *\"Datacenter design is an architecture task\"*\n\nI can both agree and disagree with that. Selecting load bearing beams, rebar sizes and placement, lashings for ducts, what mix of concrete to pour, and etc. would be for the architectural engineers. Placement of racks, choice of voltages, runs of cable, sizing cooling systems, types of battery switchovers *could* be something a sysadmin does, but could also be part of an architectural engineer / datacenter designer's job. A sysadmin doesn't have to be bonded, licensed, or otherwise take a state\\-official engineering exam to make most of those decisions (depending on locality of course). So while it's not necessarily a part of a sysadmin's job, it *could* be within the scope and by experience is within the scope.\n\nI think part of the controversy is the *scale* of what we think of as a \"datacenter.\" It can mean anything from a few hundred square foot place for a handful of racks, to a million square foot, billion dollar city\\-state of a complex. A sysadmin is unlikely to have much to say about the larger datacenters, or speciality structures for high density, HPC uses. However for the approximately 1,000 to 2,000 square foot server rooms / small datacenters, sysadmins are, in my experience, normally the ones who have a large part in the actual design of those rooms, even to the point of CADing out placement of racks and thinking about air flow, etc.\n\nConverting a few hundred to few thousand foot segment of office space, warehouse, basement, or what\\-have\\-you into a \"datacenter\" complete with raised floor, tons of cooling, backup power, generators, fuel contracts, wiring, voltage selection, etc. has, once again only in my experience, been largely up to the sysadmins of an organization and is not technically or (sometimes) legally an architectural/engineering issue other than \"call the structural engineer to see if the floor can hold us!\"\n\nAddendum 2\n==========\n\nI made another Venn diagram! This is rough, not to scale, and hastily tossed together while past midnight, but I hope this at least conveys the thought:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6I1s.png)\n\nSo there are definitely portions of work in DC design that shouldn't be touched by sysadmins, most notably the ones where law is involved, and structural engineering is needed. But datacenter design is only partly about those things. Yes, stay away from decisions regarding laws about doors, precise placement of anti\\-fire systems, locks, etc.\n\nBut the pink stuff, and the blue stuff in the diagram above are things that can, by and large, be touched by a sysadmin or the final decisions can be made by sysadmins (thus making sysadmins in\\-part designers). Not the physical installation of a CRAC or the circuit panels, but the decision on how much cooling, how much power, and even specific vendors to go with. Not necessarily cable pulling (although, how many sysadmins have pulled cable in their life? Can I see a count of hands? Uh\\-huh. A lot of us wire fishers, huh) but choosing cable types, amounts, and even plant paths to account for growth in IDFs outwards from the MDF. Certainly I'm not thinking about monster DCs, but rather a few hundred to thousand square feet of server room / datacenter space. Apple\\-sized DCs \\-\\- no way."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between system administration and datacenter design?\n\nA) System administration and datacenter design are completely separate fields with no overlap in skills or responsibilities.\n\nB) Datacenter design is always outside the scope of a system administrator's role and should only be handled by specialized architects.\n\nC) System administration includes some aspects of datacenter design, particularly for smaller facilities, but excludes structural engineering decisions.\n\nD) System administrators are solely responsible for all aspects of datacenter design, including structural engineering and legal compliance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that system administration has some overlap with datacenter design, especially for smaller facilities (up to around 1,000-2,000 square feet).

Herman Wold, who invented *partial least squares (PLS)* approach, hasn't started using term *PLS* (or even mentioning term *partial*) right away. During the *initial period* (1966\\-1969\\), he referred to this approach as **NILES** \\- abbreviation of the term and title of his initial paper on this topic *Nonlinear Estimation by Iterative Least Squares Procedures*, published in 1966\\.\n\nAs we can see, procedures that later will be called partial, have been referred to as *iterative*, focusing on the iterative nature of the procedure of estimating weights and latent variables (LVs). The \"least squares\" term comes from using *ordinary least squares (OLS)* regression to estimate other unknown parameters of a model (Wold, 1980\\). It seems that the term **\"partial\"** has its roots in the NILES procedures, which implemented **\"the idea of split the parameters of a model into subsets so they can be estimated in parts\"** (Sanchez, 2013, p. 216; emphasis mine).\n\nThe first use of the term PLS has occurred in the paper *Nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) estimation procedures*, which publication marks next period of PLS history \\- the *NIPALS modeling* period. 1970s and 1980s become the *soft modeling* period, when, influenced by Karl Joreskog's LISREL approach to SEM, Wold transforms NIPALS approach into soft modeling, which essentially has formed the core of the modern PLS approach (the term PLS becomes mainstream in the end of 1970s). 1990s, the next period in PLS history, which Sanchez (2013\\) calls \"gap\" period, is marked largely by decreasing of its use. Fortunately, starting from 2000s (*consolidation period*), PLS enjoyed its return as a very popular approach to SEM analysis, especially in social sciences.\n\n**UPDATE** (in response to amoeba's comment):\n\n* Perhaps, Sanchez's wording is not ideal in the phrase that I've cited. I think that \"estimated in parts\" applies to *latent* **blocks** of variables. Wold (1980\\) describes the concept in detail.\n* You're right that NIPALS was originally developed for PCA. The confusion stems from the fact that there exist both linear PLS and nonlinear PLS approaches. I think that Rosipal (2011\\) explains the differences very well (at least, this is the best explanation that I've seen so far).\n\n**UPDATE 2** (further clarification):\n\nIn response to concerns, expressed in amoeba's answer, I'd like to clarify some things. It seems to me that we need to distinguish the use of the word \"partial\" between NIPALS and PLS. That creates two separate questions about 1\\) the meaning of \"partial\" in NIPALS and 2\\) the meaning of \"partial\" in PLS (that's the original question by Phil2014\\). While I'm not sure about the former, I can offer further clarification about the latter.\n\nAccording to Wold, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Eriksson (2001\\),\n\n> The \"partial\" in PLS indicates that this is a partial regression, since ...\n\nIn other words, \"partial\" stems from the fact that data *decomposition* by NIPALS algorithm for PLS may *not include all components*, hence \"partial\". I suspect that the same reason applies to NIPALS in general, if it's possible to use the algorithm on \"partial\" data. That would explain \"P\" in NIPALS.\n\nIn terms of using the word \"nonlinear\" in NIPALS definition (do not confuse with *nonlinear PLS*, which represents nonlinear variant of the PLS approach!), I think that it refers **not** to the *algorithm itself*, but to **nonlinear models**, which can be analyzed, using linear regression\\-based NIPALS.\n\n**UPDATE 3 (Herman Wold's explanation):**\n\nWhile Herman Wold's 1969 paper seems to be the earliest paper on NIPALS, I have managed to find another one of the earliest papers on this topic. That is a paper by Wold (1974\\), where the \"father\" of PLS presents his rationale for using the word \"partial\" in NIPALS definition (p. 71\\):\n\n> *3\\.1\\.4\\. NIPALS estimation: Iterative OLS.* If one or more variables of the model are latent, the predictor relations involve not only unknown\n>  parameters, but also unknown variables, with the result that the\n>  estimation problem becomes nonlinear. As indicated in 3\\.1 (iii),\n>  NIPALS solves this problem by an iterative procedure, say with steps s\n>  \\= 1, 2, ... Each step s involves a finite number of OLS regressions, one for each predictor relation of the model. Each such regression\n>  gives proxy estimates for a sub\\-set of the unknown parameters and\n>  latent variables (hence the name *partial* least squares), and these\n>  proxy estimates are used in the next step of the procedure to\n>  calculate new proxy estimates.\n\n**References**\n\nRosipal, R.

Each rule needs to contain the code for the validation (which may throw an exception when the constraint is violated), as well as the documentation of the specific rule. That would allow you\n\n* to execute the rules during validation in your application\n* ro create a custom documentation generator tool which extracts the docs from the rule objects and includes them into a summary\n\nIn case you are implementing and maintaining the rules in code (and not in some DSL), this can be pretty simple and straightforward to implement. Something along the lines of (using C\\# like pseudo code):\n\n```\n  class ValidationRule\n  {\n        public abstract void Execute();   // throws an exception when rule is violated\n        public abstract string Description();  \n  }\n\n  class RoofTileCheck\n  {\n       // roof can be null in case only the description is required\n       public RoofTileCheck(Roof roof)\n       {\n           this.roof=roof;\n       }\n       public override void Execute()\n       {\n           if(roof.HasTiles && roof.Hooktype==Hooktype.None)\n                throw new ValidationException($\"Roof {roof.ID} has tiles but no hook type\");\n       }\n       public override string Description()\n       {\n            return \"If your roof has tiles, you need to specify a roof hook type\";\n       }\n  }\n\n```\n\nIf all of your 250 rules need different code, this would end up in 250 different classes, but I guess in reality there will probably fewer of them, since some of them can probably be implemented using the same class, just with different constructor parameters.\n\nFinally, you need a factory for instantiating the rule objects for your main application's rule execution loop, and another one for your documentation generator. Maybe it is the same factory if you have a 1:1 correspondence between the specific rules in your application and the docs, and a different one if some rules will only be required as some representatives in the docs.\n\nOf course, this is just a rough guideline and you may need to flesh out a lot of details here, but I gues you got the idea."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company provides an API for solar panel installation instructions with complex, dynamic constraints. They want to improve how they share these constraints with API users. Which approach would best allow them to both validate inputs and generate documentation from a single source of truth?\n\nA) Implement a large switch statement in the API code to handle all possible constraint combinations\n\nB) Create a rules engine with separate classes for each validation rule, including both execution logic and descriptions\n\nC) Store all constraints in a database and query it for both validation and documentation generation\n\nD) Use a third-party constraint satisfaction solver library to handle all validation logic\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B, implementing a rules engine with separate classes for each validation rule, is the best approach for this scenario. This solution allows the company to:\n\n1. Encapsulate each rule's logic and description in a single class\n2. Easily execute rules for validation in the main application\n3. Generate documentation by extracting descriptions from the rule objects\n4. Maintain a single source of truth for both validation and documentation\n5. Easily add, modify, or remove rules as needed\n\nThis approach provides the flexibility and maintainability required for handling a large number of dynamic constraints while also solving the documentation problem. Options A and C would be more difficult to maintain and keep in sync, while option D might not provide the necessary flexibility for custom rule descriptions and documentation generation."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/12", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/265427", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/40746/"], "docs_id": 265427, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have created one custom module named **Hs\\_Mageenhancement** and want to override below admin js file.\n\n```\nmagento2/vendor/magento/module-catalog/view/adminhtml/web/js/product-gallery.js\n\n```\n\nI have created **requirejs\\-config.js** in below path.\n\n> magento2/app/code/Hs/Mageenhancement/view/adminhtml/requirejs\\-config.js\n\n```\nvar config = {\n    \"map\": {\n        \"*\": {\n            \"Magento_Catalog/js/product-gallery\": \"Hs_Mageenhancement/js/product-gallery\",\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nPut my module **product\\-gallery.js** below path.\n\n> magento2/app/code/Hs/Mageenhancement/view/adminhtml/web/js/product\\-gallery.js\n\n```\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

"answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: When overriding a JavaScript file in Magento 2, which of the following approaches is the recommended way to extend functionality without completely replacing the original file?\n\nA) Create a new JS file in the custom module and map it directly in requirejs-config.js\nB) Copy the entire JS file to the custom module and modify it as needed\nC) Use a mixin defined in requirejs-config.js to extend the original widget\nD) Place the modified JS file directly in the vendor directory\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) While this approach can work for simple overrides, it's not the recommended method for extending existing functionality as it completely replaces the original file.\n\nB) Copying the entire file is discouraged as it makes maintaining and updating the code more difficult, especially when the core file is updated in future Magento versions.\n\nC) This is the correct and recommended approach. Using a mixin allows you to extend or modify the original widget's functionality without replacing the entire file. It provides better maintainability and compatibility with future updates.\n\nD) Modifying files directly in the vendor directory is never recommended as these changes can be lost during Magento updates.\n\nThe correct method involves creating a mixin file (e.g., product-gallery-mixin.js) and configuring it in the requirejs-config.js file of your custom module. This allows you to extend the original widget's functionality while maintaining the core file intact."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/22", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/167108", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/66074/"], "docs_id": 167108, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know that it is usual to call the people who has lived somewhere as \"native\" people. is this usual for animals too?\ncan i call \"native poultry\" of Asia?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Better call it *native to somewhere*.

It refers to a case or container that holds multiple units of a product, typically used in retail settings.

In the CLI, these wrapper objects are called **delegates** or **delegate instances**:\n\n```csharp\n//C#\nvoid Invoker(Action toInvoke) {\n    toInvoke();\n}\n\nAction action = Console.WriteLine;\nInvoker(action);\n\n//also valid, and the toInvoke argument will now contain a delegate which points to Console.WriteLine\n//Invoker(Console.WriteLine);\n\n```\n\n---\n\nWhat differences in capability arise from these two mechanisms \\-\\- \"function object\" vs \"pointer\\-to\\-function as object\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two pieces of code are not equivalent to each other. A language can be implemented in a way so that each method can be directly used as a first class object. This impacts the ABI, calling convention, and linking mechanism, but is not extraordinarily special. Most modern language implementations already attach a lot of metadata to each function.\n\nHowever, the meaning of `object.method` differs substantially between its use in delegate assignment vs its use in simple variable assignment:\n\n* In C\\#, the code `Func<\u2026> m = obj.method; m()` is equivalent to `obj.method()`. That is, a `Func<\u2026>` some kind of object that knows which object it belongs to (i.e. the method is \u201cbound\u201d to a specific object). This is exactly equivalent to a closure. The resulting `Func<\u2026>` must therefore remember both the method and the target object. Since a method may be bound to more than one object, each binding results in a new value.\n* In contrast, `obj.method` in JavaScript merely resolves the method without binding it to an object. We have to do that ourselves: `obj.method()` would be equivalent to `var m = obj.method.bind(obj); m()`. You will see that binding a method to different objects will result in values that are *not equal* to one another, while obviously the unbound method is identical.\n\nIn general, I prefer the C\\# approach, where there is equivalent semantics between `obj.method()` and all available usages of `obj.method`. On the other hand, in Javascript, `obj.method()` introduces different semantics from the similar `obj.method`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the difference between how JavaScript and C# handle function objects?\n\nA) In JavaScript, functions are always bound to their original object, while in C# they are unbound by default.\n\nB) C# does not support first-class functions at all, while JavaScript treats all functions as first-class objects.\n\nC) In JavaScript, obj.method is unbound and needs explicit binding, while in C#, obj.method automatically creates a bound delegate.\n\nD) C# and JavaScript handle function objects identically, with no significant differences in behavior or implementation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. This accurately reflects the key difference described in the documentation. In JavaScript, when you assign obj.method to a variable, it's unbound and needs explicit binding (e.g., using .bind()) to maintain the object context. In contrast, C# automatically creates a bound delegate when you use obj.method, preserving the object context without additional steps.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the actual behavior of the two languages. \n\nOption B is false because while C# doesn't treat functions as objects in the same way JavaScript does, it does support first-class functions through delegates.\n\nOption D is clearly incorrect as the documentation explicitly outlines several important differences between how the two languages handle function objects.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the subtle but important differences in how these languages handle method references and object binding, which is a key concept in understanding their respective object models and function behaviors."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/01", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/303727", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/158378/"], "docs_id": 303727, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend corrected me that asking \"can I have a ketchup?\" Instead of \" can have some ketchup?\" Sounds wrong and not native.\n\nI understand that because ketchup is not countable but since it was a fixed amount, I thought it'll be okay.\n\nLike some people say \"can I have a Coke?/I'll have a Coke\" when ordering a glass of Coke at a restaurant.

However, based on the given excerpt, there's no prior discussion of NASA's wishes. This might confuse readers, causing them to search for a reference that doesn't exist. \n\nA more appropriate word choice would be \"presumed,\" as suggested in the answer. \"Presumed\" indicates that the speaker is making an assumption about NASA's wishes without needing any prior reference, which fits the context better.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"hypothetical\" is grammatically correct in the sentence.

Please have a look:\n\n```\n public class UpdateNotification\n {\n    public void ChromeNotification(MyBaseDto baseDto, NotificationType type)\n    {\n        OnUpdateAvailable(baseDto, type);\n    }\n    public void OutlookUpdateNotification(MyBaseDto baseDto,   \n  NotificationType type)\n    {\n        OnUpdateAvailable(baseDto, type);\n    }\n    public void OnUpdateAvailable(MyBaseDto baseDto, NotificationType type)\n    {\n        if (type == NotificationType.Chrome)\n        {\n            // it uses baseDto.IsUpdateAvailable as well as it downcast it \n     to DerivedAdto and uses other properties\n\n            var derivedDto = baseDto as DerivedAdto;\n        }\n\n        if (type == NotificationType.Outlook)\n        {\n            // currently it just uses baseDto.IsUpdateAvailable\n        }\n    }\n    public enum NotificationType\n    {\n        Chrome,\n        Outlook\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n\nI am focussing here on the use of DTO objects which are \"MyBaseDto\", \"DerivedAdto\" and \"DerivedBdto\".

When you take an argument of type `MyBaseDto` you're depending on abstraction which could represent any number of derived classes. But as soon as you start casting it back to specific derived types, you're now tightly coupled to each of those derived types. \n\nWhen you pass a parameter of type `MyBaseDto`, all the method should ever need to know about its type is that it is a `MyBaseDto`. As soon as you start casting it then you start to lose the benefit of strong typing. What if someone passes in the wrong `NotificationType` and as a result you try to cast `baseDto` to the wrong type? \n\nTechnically you could just change the type of the first parameter to `object` and then cast it to whatever type you expect it to be. But strong typing is supposed to ensure that you already know what type you have. And all you need to know about an object is its *declared* type \\- the type specified by the argument. \n\nIt's not a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle because that violation would occur in the class (`MyBaseDto`) and its derived classes. The problem isn't in those classes, but rather how they're being used.\n\nIn a nutshell, if receive type `A` and then start inspecting it or casting it to see if it's really derived type `B` or `C` then something has gone wrong.

If you simply want to assess the possible association between variables, correlations are a simple and convenient place to start.

We can introduce in $l^{2}(\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d})$ the discrete Laplacian as the linear operator:\n$$(\\\\Delta \\\\psi)(x) :\\= \\\\sum\\_{k\\=1}^{d}\\[\\-2\\\\psi(x)\\+\\\\psi(x\\+e\\_{k})\\+\\\\psi(x\\-e\\_{k})]$$\nwhere $\\\\{e\\_{1},...,e\\_{d}\\\\}$ is the canonical basis of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Because $(\\-\\\\Delta\\+m^{2})$ has a resolvent for every $m\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, we can consider its inverse $(\\-\\\\Delta\\+m^{2})^{\\-1}$.

Note that $s$ is a Fr\u00e9chet space when its topology is given by the family of semi\\-norms $\\|\\|\\\\cdot\\|\\|\\_{m}$ and $s'$ is the dual space of $s$ if $l\\_{\\\\psi}$ is a continuous linear map on $s$ with $l\\_{\\\\psi}(\\\\phi) \\=( \\\\psi,\\\\phi) :\\= \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\psi\\_{n}\\\\phi\\_{n}$. Let $C\\=(C\\_{xy})\\_{x,y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{d}}$ be an 'infinite matrix' with entries $C\\_{xy}:\\= G(x,y)$. We can consider $C\\_{xy}$ to be a matrix $C\\=(C\\_{ij})\\_{i,j \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}$ by enumerating $\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$.

Then, these matrices $C\\_{\\\\Lambda}$ are all positive\\-definite, so that they define Gaussian measures $\\\\mu\\_{\\\\Lambda}$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\Lambda}$. Besides, these are compatible in the sense that if $\\\\Lambda \\\\subset \\\\Lambda'$ are both finite and $E$ is a Borel set in $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\Lambda}$ then $\\\\mu\\_{\\\\Lambda}(E) \\= \\\\mu\\_{\\\\Lambda'}(E\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\Lambda'\\\\setminus\\\\Lambda})$. By Kolmogorov's Extension Theorem, there exists a Gaussian measure $\\\\nu\\_{C}$ with covariance $C$ on $l^{2}(\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d})$ which is compatible with $\\\\mu\\_{\\\\Lambda}$ for every finite $\\\\Lambda$. \n\nNow, It seems that these two constructions occur when the so\\-called thermodynamics limit is taken in QFT and Statistical Mechanics. Both Gaussian measures $\\\\mu\\_{C}$ and $\\\\nu\\_{C}$ are measures on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d}}\\\\cong \\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{N}}$. I don't know if this is true but I'd expect these two constructions to be equivalent in some sense, but it is not obvious to me that they are. For instance, the first construction provides a Gaussian measure on $s'$ and the second one on $l^{2}(\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d})$. Are there any relation between these two measures? Are they equal? Maybe the Fourier transform of $\\\\nu\\_{C}$ would give $W\\_{C}$, proving these two are the same. Anyway, I'm very lost here and any help would be appreciated. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The source of the confusion is *not saying* explicitly what are the sets and $\\\\sigma$\\-algebras the measures are supposed to be on. For example, a sentence like ''By Kolmogorov's Extension Theorem, there exists a Gaussian measure $\\\\nu\\_C$ with covariance $C$ on $l^2(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ which is compatible with $\\\\mu\\_\\\\Lambda$ for every finite $\\\\mu\\_\\\\Lambda$.'' is asking for trouble because it seems to say the measure $\\\\nu\\_C$ is on the set $l^2(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$, which is false. \n\nLet's go back to basics. A measurable space $(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F})$ is a set $\\\\Omega$ equipped with a $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\mathcal{F}$. A measure $\\\\mu$ on the measurable space $(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F})$ is a map from $\\\\mathcal{F}$ to $\\[0,\\\\infty]$ satisfying the usual axioms. From now on I will only talk about probability measures.\nFor best behavior, the $\\\\Omega$ should be a (nice) topological space and $\\\\mathcal{F}$ should be the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra for that topology. Suppose one has two topological spaces $X,Y$ and a continuous injective map $\\\\tau:X\\\\rightarrow Y$. Then if $\\\\mu$ is a measure on $(X,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X)$ where $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X$ is the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra of $X$, then one can construct the direct image/push forward measure $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ on $(Y,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_Y)$ by letting\n$$\n\\\\forall B\\\\in\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{Y},\\\\ \n(\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu)(B):\\=\\\\mu(\\\\tau^{\\-1}(B))\\\\ .\n$$\nThis is well defined because a continuous map like $\\\\tau$ is also $(\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_Y)$\\-measurable. Technically speaking $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ are different measures because they are on different spaces. However, one could argue that they are *morally* the same. For example, one might be given the measure $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ without knwing that it is of that form, and only later realize that it is and thus lives on the smaller set $\\\\tau(X)$ inside $Y$.\n\n**The first construction:**\n\nLet $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of multi\\-sequences of fast decay $f\\=(f\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$, i.e., the ones for which\n$$\n\\\\forall k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, \\|\\|f\\|\\|\\_k:\\=\\\\sup\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\langle x\\\\rangle^k\\|f\\_x\\|\\\\ \\<\\\\infty\n$$\nwhere $\\\\langle x\\\\rangle\\=\\\\sqrt{1\\+x\\_1^2\\+\\\\cdots\\+x\\_d^2}$.\nPut on the vector space $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ the locally convex topology defined by the collection of seminorms $\\|\\|\\\\cdot\\|\\|\\_k$, $k\\\\ge 0$.\nThe strong dual can be concretely realized as the space $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ of multi\\-sequences of temperate growth. Namely, $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of discrete fields $\\\\phi\\=(\\\\phi\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ such that\n$$\n\\\\exists k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\exists K\\\\ge 0,\\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d,\\\\ \\|\\\\phi\\_x\\|\\\\le K\\\\langle x\\\\rangle^k\\\\ .\n$$\nThe vector space $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is given the locally convex topology generated by the seminorms\n$\\|\\|\\\\phi\\|\\|\\_{\\\\rho}\\=\\\\sum\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\rho\\_x\\\\ \\|\\\\phi\\_x\\|$\nwhere $\\\\rho$ ranges over elements of $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with nonnegative values.\n\nThe measure $\\\\mu\\_C$ obtained via the Bochner\\-Minlos Theorem is a measure on $X\\=s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with its Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X$.\n\n**The second construction:**\n\nLet $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of multi\\-sequences of finite support $f\\=(f\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$, i.e., the ones for which\n$f\\_x\\=0$ outside some finite set $\\\\Lambda\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{Z}^d$. Put on the vector space $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ the finest locally convex topology. Namely, this is the locally convex topology\ngenerated by the collection of *all* seminorms on $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ .\nNote that $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)\\\\simeq \\\\oplus\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $s'\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the strong topological dual realized concretely as $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$.

The continuous canonical injection \u03c4 from s'(\u2124d) to \u211d\u2124d allows us to relate these measures by \u03bdC = \u03c4*\u03bcC.

Which of the following queries will correctly achieve this?\n\nA) SELECT PRODUCTID, UPC\n   FROM Products\n   GROUP BY UPC\n   HAVING MAX(PRODUCTID)\n\nB) SELECT MAX(PRODUCTID) AS PRODUCTID, UPC\n   FROM Products\n   GROUP BY UPC\n\nC) SELECT PRODUCTID, UPC\n   FROM Products\n   WHERE PRODUCTID = (SELECT MAX(PRODUCTID) FROM Products p2 WHERE p2.UPC = Products.UPC)\n\nD) SELECT TOP 1 PRODUCTID, UPC\n   FROM Products\n   ORDER BY PRODUCTID DESC\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct answer because it uses the GROUP BY clause to group the rows by UPC, and then selects the MAX(PRODUCTID) for each group. This effectively selects the highest PRODUCTID for each unique UPC.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the HAVING clause is used incorrectly. It should filter groups, not select values.\n\nOption C is a subquery approach that would work, but it's less efficient than option B for large datasets.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it would only return the single highest PRODUCTID across all UPCs, not the highest for each unique UPC."}}
