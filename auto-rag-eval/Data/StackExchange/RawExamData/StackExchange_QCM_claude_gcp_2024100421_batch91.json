I'm on Ubuntu 18\\.04, GDM/Gnome, default Ubuntu desktop. My graphics driver is `nvidia-390` from the `graphics-drivers` PPA. My graphics card is a GeForce GTX 960M.\n\nThere have been two incidents where my display freezes and I'm unable to get into a TTY, so I shut down and restart by power cycling. Then, I get to the login screen and login, only to get a blank screen with only the cursor.\n\nNow, If I go into a TTY and look at `Xorg.0.log`, there's one weird thing: Xorg seems to think all of my devices are keyboards.

Now I really don't want to do this anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Typically, `dconf` schemas translate nicely into `gsettings` schemas by replacing slashes with dots and vice versa. \n\nIn your example, `org.mate.peripherals-mouse` is the closest matching for what I'd expect to be a static schema.\n\nHowever, not all `gsettings` schemas translate nicely. There's something known as [relocatable schemas](https://blog.gtk.org/2017/05/01/first-steps-with-gsettings/):\n\n> A relocatable schema is what you need when you need multiple instances of the same configuration, stored separately. A typical example for this is accounts: your application allows to create more than one, and each of them has the same kind of configuration information associated with it.\n\nFor such cases, schema also requires a particular path added to it. [For example](https://askubuntu.com/a/290160/295286),\n\n```\ngsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ dash-blur-experimental 1\n\n```\n\nHere's another example from one of Budgie desktop schemas:\n\n```\n$ dconf write /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/panels/{5f6251f2-9d09-11e8-be4b-d053493d53fd}/size 52\n$ gsettings set com.solus-project.budgie-panel.panel:/com/solus-project/budgie-panel/panels/{5f6251f2-9d09-11e8-be4b-d053493d53fd}/ size 52\n\n```\n\nTypically paths for relocatable `gsettings` schemas are the same as for `dconf`, but [it's not guaranteed](https://stackoverflow.com/q/30687792/3701431) from what I understand. Manual way would be to run `dconf watch /` and use GUI buttons/sliders/preferences menus to figure out which schemas are controlled by those."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working with GNOME desktop environment configurations and need to modify settings using the command line.

The documentation explains that while many dconf schemas translate nicely into gsettings schemas by replacing slashes with dots (and vice versa), this is not always the case. Relocatable schemas in gsettings require a specific path to be added, and these paths may not always exactly match the dconf paths. The example given shows how a dconf write command and its equivalent gsettings set command can have slightly different syntax, especially for relocatable schemas. This complexity means that while there is often a correlation between dconf and gsettings paths, it's not guaranteed to be a direct translation in all cases."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/06", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/301875", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/203020/"], "docs_id": 301875, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to write effective unit tests for unstructured code? \n\nI was reading through the various answers to [this question](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/149578/is-unit-testing-procedural-code-effective).

I imagine that it would be difficult indeed to test unstructured code, but I'm also curious to know if it's possible, and what the best practices are for unit testing such code.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Unless you want to seriously twist the meaning of the term \"unit testing\" in such a way that it essentially becomes synonymous with \"system testing\", unit testing a system that has no individual units to test, is meaningless.\n\nYou can of course do system testing. If the code performs multiple functionalities, you can do functional testing. If the code integrates with other code, you can do integration testing. If you have some acceptance criteria for the code, you can do acceptance testing.

According to the documentation, unit testing is not possible for unstructured code because unit testing, by definition, tests individual independent units in isolation. Unstructured code lacks these distinct units. However, other forms of testing such as system testing, functional testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, and performance testing can still be applied to unstructured code.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because treating the entire codebase as a single unit would be more akin to system testing, not unit testing.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it suggests modifying the code structure, which goes beyond the scope of implementing testing for existing unstructured code.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it contradicts the information provided, which states that unit testing unstructured code is not possible, regardless of tools or techniques used."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/29", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/88130", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/31418/"], "docs_id": 88130, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Magento 1\\.9\\.2\\.0 is not showing web\\-secure\\-url or baseurl even any path for %http:// % .

We're using [the Dragon Book](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321486811). Shortly into the course and we're talking about lexical analysis and how it can be implemented via deterministic finite automata (hereafter, DFA). Set up your various lexer states, define transitions between them, etc.\n\nBut both the professor and the book propose implementing them via transition tables which amount to a giant 2d array (the various non\\-terminal states as one dimension, and the possible input symbols as the other) and a switch statement to handle all of the terminals as well as dispatch to the transition tables if in a non\\-terminal state.\n\nThe theory is all well and good, but as someone who's actually written code for decades, the implementation is vile. It's not testable, it's not maintainable, it's not readable, and it's a pain and a half to debug through. Worse yet, I can't see how it would be remotely practical if the language was UTF capable. Having a million or so transition table entries per non\\-terminal state gets unweildy in a hurry.\n\nSo what's the deal? Why is the definitive book on the subject saying to do it this way?\n\nIs the overhead of function calls really that much?

I came across this [blog post](http://blog.soliveirajr.com/intro-to-parallel-processing-with-mapreduce/) that tries to explain just MapReduce without Hadoop, but I still have some questions.\n\n* Does MapReduce really have an intermediate phase called *grouping* as the article describes?\n* Can the grouping phase also be done in parallel or only the map and reduce phases?\n* Does the map and reduce operations described in the article make sense for the problem proposed (indexing web pages by keywords)? They look too simple to me.\n* Is the main purpose of MapReduce really just parallelization when indexing large amounts of data?\n* Do you think too many people know Hadoop without understanding the fundamentals of MapReduce? Is it a problem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: MapReduce actually has a grouping phase. The map phase essentially consists in transforming inputs into pairs of (key,value) elements. Because the reduce phase consists in \"aggregating\" all the values associated to the same key, you cannot avoid the need to group all values by key before the reduce phase. This may need a lot of time since values must be shuffled over the cluster. \n\nThe grouping phase can be made in parallel. Basically, a cluster node is associated to each generated key. Then, all the generated pairs of (key, value) are sent to the node associated to their key. This typically leads to an important network overload, and this phase is considered as network bounded. \n\nThe indexing of Web pages by keyword is a typical application of MapReduce. More generally, dictionary reversing can almost directly be described as a MapReduce task. You can see it as a process for building a basic search engine: you want to find Web sites containing \u00e0 particular keyword. Because you don't have time to browse all the sites for each incoming query, you have to prepare a reverse dictionary of (keyword, websites).\n\nMapReduce is not limited to indexing tasks. The map and reduce tasks can be less or more complex than those required for an indexing. You can also combine several map and reduce tasks for carrying out more complex data processing. For instance, Apache Pig provides a SQL\\-like language for describing \"complex\" MapReduce jobs.\n\nI don't think you can correctly use Hadoop (directly) without mastering its basis. You cannot correctly describe a map or a reduce task if you don't understand how the framework will use it for processing submitted data. A deeper understanding of the MapReduce mechanism also helps to understand why a job takes so long, or why adding CPUs will not help to reduce processing time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the grouping phase in MapReduce?\n\nA) It's an optional phase that can be skipped to improve performance\nB) It's a phase where data is randomly distributed across the cluster\nC) It's a phase where all values associated with the same key are grouped together before the reduce phase\nD) It's a phase that only occurs in Hadoop implementations, not in the general MapReduce paradigm\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The grouping phase is an essential part of the MapReduce paradigm. After the map phase generates key-value pairs, the grouping phase collects all values associated with the same key. This is necessary because the reduce phase operates on all values for a given key. The grouping phase can be parallelized, with different nodes in the cluster handling different keys. This phase is often network-bound due to the need to shuffle data across the cluster. Understanding this phase is crucial for optimizing MapReduce jobs and comprehending why certain operations may take longer than others."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/08", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/76890", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/23786/"], "docs_id": 76890, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am working on a project for which I would have to make a map displaying all archaeological sites of the city; it will later be used and accessed by my office's stuff only.

Can the pings to that machine acts as radii of circles on a map and a bunch of circle intersection math take place to narrow the location of the 10th user?\n\nI am guessing it would depend on the correlation between ping and distance from a machine (since packets probably go through so many different routers before reaching location), but could a method like this pinpoint with more accuracy than just doing a lookup of the machine's ISP?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is YES, but with a lot of caveats. Let me re\\-phrase the question into a more useful form: \n\n**Using only Ethernet packets, on an Ethernet network, can you determine the physical cable length from one device to another?** \n\nThere is a standard called the [Precision Time Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol) (PTP), which is used to synchronize clocks of devices on a network. The basic protocol can achieve sub\\-microsecond accuracy, but there are ways to get accuracy down to 10's of nanoseconds. \n\nPart of this protocol requires hardware\\-based timestamping of Ethernet packets in order to measure and calculate the \"time of flight\" of a packet across an Ethernet cable. This time of flight measurement is then used to adjust for any clock skew across the network. In our case, we only care about the time of flight.\n\nWhile this does work across Ethernet switches and routers, to get an accurate time of flight the switch needs to support PTP and be involved in the measurements. PTP does support the involvement of the switches and routers. Because PTP uses Multicast packets, it won't work over the Internet.\n\nMore and more Ethernet controllers support PTP (even some PC motherboards support it), although switch and router support is lagging by quite a bit. \n\nIn theory, PTP can do this. In practice, I don't know if you can extract the time of flight data from this clock syncing protocol\\-\\- but the data is there. It might require some somewhat custom implementations of PTP, and definately requires switches/routers that are rare or not quite on the market yet. I am also massively generalizing PTP. I know the hardware side of PTP, but there is a lot of software that I don't know completely.\n\nAnother alternative to PTP is to use Ethernet Phy's that can measure the length of the cable. It turns out that many Gigabit Ethernet Phy's can do this now, but those features are rarely exposed past the device driver level. The Phy's do this by using time\\-domain reflectometry, and can also measure the distance to the break in a faulty cable. \n\nThe main problem with any of this is that it measures cable length, not physical position. If the cables were measured accurately, and they were stretched in a straight line, then that could determine physical location. But that never happens. It also requires that the network infrastructure is under your control, which it is probably not. \n\nOf course, what I describe is nothing like using Ping times across the internet to get a physical location. I agree with others that this is not going to be very useful, and probably won't get you anything more accurate than what Continent you're on (if that)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of network timing protocols for determining the physical location of a device on a network?\n\nA) Ping times across the internet can be reliably used to triangulate a device's exact geographic location.\n\nB) The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can accurately measure the physical distance between two devices on an Ethernet network, regardless of network infrastructure.\n\nC) Time-domain reflectometry in Gigabit Ethernet PHYs can measure cable length, but this doesn't directly translate to physical location.\n\nD) Standard consumer-grade routers and switches universally support PTP, making it easy to implement location tracking on any network.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Here is the datasheet of the receiver: [https://www.es.co.th/Schemetic/PDF/RWS\\-371F\\-6\\.PDF](https://www.es.co.th/Schemetic/PDF/RWS-371F-6.PDF)\n\nI don't have knowledge about RF design, just electronics and MCU programming. I'm using manchester encoding/decoding @ 1000bps to improve the communication distance from receptor board to the transmitter. 'RF\\-TX' is a 0V\\~5V signal.\nThe circuit of RF was copied from a board of a garage door opener, but I included my own microcontroller to the PCB schematic and I have a prototype of my board. The values of resistors (150 Ohms, 47K, 47 Ohms) was also copied from the garage opener transmitter board. Here I am showing the layout of my board and the values/part number of the components. I've mounted few pF combination values (0805\\) for C2/C3\\. I have a capacitor sample book with many values on pF range, many values from 1 to 22pF. The communication TX/RX is working correctly, but I want to check if I can increase the distance range by using ADEQUATE VALUES FOR C2/C3\\. Currently I'm using both as 1pF.\n\nAt the receptor, I'm using coil loaded antenna with 1/4 of wavelength, the same of the picture, tomorrow I will try a straight rigid wire of 1/2 of wavelength.\n\nWell, as said, my doubt is around the correct values of C2/C3, can somebody who understand of RF desing calculate them easily? Or does this generate a kind of service I have to contract a RF designer to calculate them to me?\n\nRegards.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0IwBy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0IwBy.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/avrqN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/avrqN.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OTc1.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OTc1.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NG4AL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NG4AL.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This paper from Epcos gives some hints on SAW transmitters: [http://jap.hu/electronic/rf/434MHz\\_SAW\\-based\\_oscillators\\_and\\_transmitters.pdf](http://jap.hu/electronic/rf/434MHz_SAW-based_oscillators_and_transmitters.pdf)\nBasically, C2 and C3 provide positive feedback and also tune the antenna to the desired frequency, what improves efficiency.

He was perplexed as to why this was the case since he had previously disabled it with the command `setenforce 0`. \n\nDisabling SELinux in this fashion will only remain in this state until the next reboot. The default mode for SELinux is dictated by this file on Fedora/CentOS:\n\n```\n$ cat /etc/sysconfig/selinux\n# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.\n# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:\n#   enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.\n#   permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.\n#   disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.\nSELINUX=disabled\n# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are:\n#   targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.\n#   strict - Full SELinux protection.\nSELINUXTYPE=targeted\n\n```\n\nTo permanently disable SELinux you'll want to change the line `SELINUX=..` to one of the 3 states, `enforcing`, `permissive`, `disabled`.\n\nI would encourage you however to take the time to understand why SELinux is disallowing the access to the directory these log files are within, and add the appropriate context's so that SELinux allows this access. SELinux is an important part of the layered security model that is facilitated on Linux distros that make use of it, and blindly disabling it is taking one of the critical layers away.\n\n### References\n\n* [45\\.2\\.7\\.

The administrator has confirmed that SELinux is in enforcing mode.

Using strace to capture detailed information about the logrotate process when run from cron will provide valuable insights into why the process is failing, particularly with regards to permission issues. This debugging technique can help identify if SELinux is indeed the root cause and provide specifics about which permissions are being denied.\n\nOption A (disabling SELinux) is not recommended as a first step, as it removes an important security layer without understanding the underlying issue. Option B (adding the -f flag) is unlikely to resolve the permission issues. Option D (changing ownership) may not be necessary and could introduce security risks if done improperly.\n\nThe strace approach allows for a thorough investigation of the problem while maintaining the system's security posture, making it the best choice for diagnosing this logrotate issue."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/30", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/652268", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/258581/"], "docs_id": 652268, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For a few years now at work I have been using the GNOME Terminal, and have gotten very used to that.

But why is that? ... why can't the device driver also runs in user mode?\n\nDrivers run in kernel mode while applications run in user mode for many reason. For example\n\n* a driver has need of high priority to service device I/O in a predictable manner (and otherwise can risk loosing some data). For example, drivers may need to run without incurring page faults. Putting driver memory in the kernel is one easy way of accomplishing this. (In truth, this is, of course, much more complicated: usually drivers have a small amount of super high priority code along with some less critical additional code that also runs in the kernel, and the two share memory.)\n* I/O instructions and device memory mapped I/O addresses are typically protected from application code, so applications are not allowed direct access to these resources. Forcing applications to use kernel/system calls allows the operating system to share devices between multiple applications, or even multiple virtual machines.\n* Having applications use a kernel/system read/write interface to access devices allows device substitution and upgrading device drivers independently from the application.\n\nApplications, by contrast, typically run in user mode, with a degree of abstraction from the underlying devices and their implementation.\n\n---\n\n> I mean when my application communicated directly with the USB driver, it was running in user mode.\n\nYes, but the application's communication with the USB driver is done via kernel/system calls, so the kernel is involved in this. Further, the USB driver itself is typically in the kernel; just library routines to access them are in the application or application\\-used libraries.\n\n---\n\nIf you write your own device driver, you could put all your application's functionality into the device driver and thus not require a user mode application at all.

What can sound as basic to you, is like a new discovery for me. \n\nSecond, I would like to introduce you the context I am going to use this:\nI have set up an experiment in which I have a beam with a fixed end and a free end. The free end has a magnet coupled, which moves inside a coil, in order to transfer energy from my mechanical domain (beam) to an electrical circuit. [![Experiment schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcSM6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcSM6.png)\n\nDue to my experimental restrictions, I can't attach the coil to the beam and build a proper magnet circuit around it, so in order to improve my electromechanical coupling I have built a coil with 27k turns (using AWG 34\\), which gave me a 3\\.3 KOhms resistance and 10\\.8 H inductance. \n\nSince I am investigating the damping provided by the electrical domain to my beam, I don't care about the inductance, but the internal resistance of my coil is an issue. Finally I come to my electronics question: is it possible to reduce the resistance of a voltage source (coil)? If yes, how can I do that?\n\nI have tried building a [Negative Impedance Converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_impedance_converter) (NIC) so I could achieve a [static negative resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_resistance#Negative_static_or_%22absolute%22_resistance). Apparently, this NIC only works to improve the impedance of current sources, but it is not practical to use it to improve the impedance of voltage sources. I have studied a bit of [Norton's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton%27s_theorem) to get my equivalent current source and I have tested it with the INIC, but the results were just equivalent to having my coil short circuited, which means the equivalent resistance was the internal resistance (Rs) of my coil (or near it). \n\nSo is it even possible to reduce my coil's internal resistance without changing it, just using electronics? I have seen there are another options like [gyrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrator), but I would not like to lose more time to just discover it won't work. \n\nHopefully you will be able to help me and if you think I should improve my question just ask for more details.\n\nThanks! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: I think you would be best off using a different design of coil, but if you want a direct answer to the question you asked:\n\n**Immerse the coil in liquid nitrogen.**\n\nThis will reduce its resistance by a factor of 70 or so. The coil will also stay cold and low resistance for a few minutes after draining away the nitrogen, if the presence of the liquid would interfere with your experiment.\n\nThis is very much a one\\-off solution, you wouldn't want to build a product with it, but it sounds like this is a one off experiment, so it might work for you. \n\nNote that liquid nitrogen is a somewhat dangerous substance.

This approach can decrease the resistance by a factor of about 70, which is significant for the experiment.

Applying Norton's theorem (B) to convert the voltage source to a current source doesn't actually reduce the internal resistance. Using a gyrator circuit (D) might modify some characteristics of the coil, but it's not as effective or straightforward for reducing resistance as the liquid nitrogen method.\n\nIt's important to note that working with liquid nitrogen requires proper safety precautions due to its dangerous nature, including the risk of severe burns and potential for explosions if not handled correctly."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/389398", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/217956/"], "docs_id": 389398, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I often see classes of this form:\n\n```\nclass Thingy {\n    public Thingy( /* some arguments here */ ) {\n        // Initialize some member variables.\n        // Maybe do some other things that\n        // are not likely to fail\n    }\n\n    public Execute() {\n        // Do the important stuff.\n        // This often involves actions that might\n        // fail, like file access, user input etc.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis makes perfect sense when `Execute()` is called multiple times per object.

Commands are useful when you have `unexecute` sort of functionality, need to serialize this type across servers, or when this is one implementation.\n\n*Mostly* though, this sort of thing comes up in old Java code (or with programmers used to writing old Java code) where decent function\\-pointer/delegate/lambda syntax was unavailable.\n\nThe command pattern itself is a generally agreed upon good pattern.\n\nThe concept of some function that must be called before other things (even if it's not an initializer) is called temporal coupling, and is a well\\-known code smell."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented programming, what is the primary advantage of using a class with separate initialization and execution methods (like the Thingy class example) over a standalone function or static method, especially when the execution method is only called once per object?\n\nA) It allows for better memory management and garbage collection\nB) It enables the separation of initialization from execution, allowing for different timing, parallelization, or error handling\nC) It improves the overall performance of the application\nD) It reduces the complexity of the code and makes it easier to maintain\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The main advantage of using a class with separate initialization and execution methods is that it allows for the separation of initialization from execution. This separation can be beneficial in several ways:\n\n1. Timing: Initialization and execution can happen at different times, providing more flexibility in the program's flow.\n2. Parallelization: Different parallelization strategies can be applied to initialization and execution if needed.\n3. Error handling: Separate methods allow for different error handling approaches for initialization and execution.\n4. Authentication/Authorization: Different security measures can be implemented for initialization and execution if required.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while object-oriented design can impact memory management, it's not the primary advantage in this context.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because this design pattern doesn't necessarily improve overall performance. In some cases, it might even introduce a slight overhead.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because this pattern doesn't always reduce complexity. In fact, for simple operations, it might add unnecessary complexity compared to a standalone function.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of object-oriented design patterns and their practical applications in software development."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/15", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/315083", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/61352/"], "docs_id": 315083, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to create auto generate coupons in magento 2 but its showing as below:\n\n> Message is added to queue, wait to get your coupons soon\n\nAny help will be appreciated?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: try to manually process queue with this command\n\n```\nbin/magento queue:consumers:list\n\n```\n\nview a list of all consumers\n\n```\nbin/magento queue:consumers:start <queue_name>\n\n```\n\npass queue\\_name for process the queue"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Magento 2 developer is attempting to auto-generate coupons but encounters the message \"Message is added to queue, wait to get your coupons soon.\" To resolve this issue and process the queue manually, which sequence of commands should the developer use?\n\nA) First run \"bin/magento queue:consumers:start\", then \"bin/magento queue:consumers:list <queue_name>\"\nB) Only run \"bin/magento queue:consumers:list\"\nC) First run \"bin/magento queue:consumers:list\", then \"bin/magento queue:consumers:start <queue_name>\"\nD) Only run \"bin/magento queue:consumers:start <queue_name>\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to first list all available consumers using \"bin/magento queue:consumers:list\".

However, maybe there is an issue with the power supply? In my experience it is unlikely, but if you have an extra power supply and some free time on your hands try hooking that up and seeing if the problem persists.\n\nAs well, find an SSD testing utility for your drive. There are many out there and often manufacturers will have their own (you didn't specify what drive you have, but just do a quick search and you'll find something).

Also, make sure you have the latest firmware for the drive and any updates.\nSSDs \"fail\" somewhat differently from regular hard drives.

It would only go backward, and forward movement would stutter. After some investigating, it turned out that one of the H\\-bridge NPN transistors is faulty. Since a direct replacement is difficult to get, I found a substitute. I wasn't worried too much about parameters, I thought transistors in an H\\-bridge operate in the saturation region and there should be a lot of leeway.\n\nHere is the schematic, reverse\\-engineered from the PCB:\n\n![H-bridge schematic, reverse-engineered from the PCB](https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1der.png)\n\nI substituted the original Q14 (2SD882, marked as NEC D882\\) with a BD238\\. The BD238 has a lower hFE (\\>40, instead of \\>80\\), and lower Ic, which I didn\u2019t think would matter. \\[**Edit**: as people correctly pointed out, the rather ridiculous mistake I made was that the BD238 is a PNP transistor! There is nothing like another pair of eyes. So, at least this part of the question is already answered.]\n\nWell, it turns out the replacement does not work. Which made me investigate the circuit closer, which made me realize that I don't really understand how it works, much less why the replacement doesn't work. And the circuit is rather interesting and uses very few components. Note for example the lack of catch diodes. I guess that's why transistors with Vceo\\=30V were used, with the hope they would withstand the voltage spikes.\n\nAfter replacing the faulty transistor, the motor never turns in the direction which is handled by that H\\-bridge branch.\n\nI tried a number of things. I narrowed it down to a single direction not working. Replacing the NPN transistor in that branch with a 2SD882 makes this direction work again. I also tried doubling the base currents (to possibly compensate for the lower hFE) by connecting another 47\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the 51\u03a9 resistor in the branch. No change.\n\nI thought about the B\\-E voltage drop of the new BD238 transistor \u2014 after all, the circuit is powered from about 5 volts, which has to be enough for 3 junctions (B\\-E of Q12, E\\-C of Q10 and B\\-E of Q14\\), but I can\u2019t see how it could be high enough to prevent the circuit from working.\n\nI am seeking answers to the following questions:\n\n* How does this circuit work? It has amazingly few components. Bringing one of the inputs low should switch on three transistors (for example, Q10, Q12 and Q14\\), but I don't see how just pulling the base of Q10 low would do that. Where does the voltage on Q12's base come from? There is no biasing, no pullups. Is bringing the base of Q10 low enough to start current flowing through Q12 (E\\-B)?\n* Why does replacing a 2SD882 with a BD238 not work? I have to understand this before I go looking for other replacements. \\[**Edit**: this part is already answered, I made the silly mistake of substituting a PNP transistor without noticing it.]\n* How important is PNP/PNP complementary pair matching in an H\\-bridge? I couldn't find any information on that. Everybody mentions that it's good to have a matching pair, but no rationale is given. I don't see how minor differences in hFE could (or should) influence the behavior of a simple motor driver circuit.\n\nThe toy car is powered by 4 D batteries (so slightly above 5 volts), and the motor draws about 0\\.4A in normal operation. I also measured the base current for the NPN H\\-bridge transistors when activated: it's 60mA when an 2SD882 is installed, and 2\\.2mA when the BD238 is installed.\n\nLinks to relevant datasheets, for easier access:\n\n* 2SD882: [http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439\\.pdf](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439.pdf)\n* BD238: [https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238\\.pdf](https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main problem is that the BD238 is a PNP transisor, not NPN!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a DIY repair of an RC toy car's H-bridge motor driver circuit, a faulty NPN transistor (2SD882) was mistakenly replaced with a BD238.

You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit` and `nvidia-smi\nNVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.\n\n```\n\nThe step that actually installs CUDA is `sudo apt-get install cuda`, and that didn't go through, as you can see from my post.\n\n```\n$ dpkg-query -s cuda\ndpkg-query: package 'cuda' is not installed and no information is available\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I ran into this problem trying to install CUDA 9\\.0 on Ubuntu 17\\.10, and I solved it by uncommenting the following line in my `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-9-0-local.list`\n\n```\n# deb file:///var/cuda-repo-9-0-local / # disabled on upgrade to artful\n\n```\n\n\\=\\>\n\n```\ndeb file:///var/cuda-repo-9-0-local /\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When installing CUDA on Ubuntu, a user encounters an error \"Unable to locate package cuda\" after following the official installation instructions. What is a potential solution to this issue?\n\nA) Manually copy the .deb file to /var/cuda-repo-8-0-local-ga2\nB) Run sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-* to remove existing NVIDIA packages\nC) Install nvidia-cuda-toolkit using sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nD) Uncomment the relevant deb line in the appropriate sources.list.d file\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct solution is to uncomment the relevant deb line in the appropriate sources.list.d file. In the given example, the user encountered an issue with installing CUDA 8.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. The top answer provides a solution for a similar problem with CUDA 9.0 on Ubuntu 17.10, which involves uncommenting a line in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-9-0-local.list file. This solution can be adapted for different CUDA versions and Ubuntu releases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manually copying the .deb file was attempted and did not resolve the issue.\nOption B is incorrect because removing NVIDIA packages is not necessary and won't solve the package location problem.\nOption C is incorrect because installing nvidia-cuda-toolkit is a separate process and won't directly solve the \"Unable to locate package cuda\" error.\n\nThe correct approach (D) ensures that the package manager can locate the CUDA repository, allowing the installation to proceed."}}
