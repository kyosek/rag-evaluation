Some ways of teaching least\\-squares regression (e.g, starting from correlations of normally distributed variables) might seem to begin with such an assumption, but there is absolutely no normality assumption about either the predictors or the outcome variables themselves in regression.\n\nYour data are [left censored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)) at an MRD of $10^{\\-5}$. That means the actual MRD is somewhere between 0 and $10^{\\-5}$, but you don't know exactly where. [This answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1795/28500) suggests a simple way to start. Add a separate binary predictor variable indicating whether the MRD value was observed or was set to 0 due to left censoring. For data points set to 0 due to left censoring, re\\-set their MRD values to the lower detection limit of $10^{\\-5}$. You might then transform all the MRD values to $\\\\log\\_{10}(\\\\text{MRD}) \\+5$ so that the left\\-censoring value is transformed to 0 and you get log\\-transformed values above that.\n\nThe regression coefficient for the binary predictor variable gives an overall estimate of the association of \"0 MRD\" in the original scale with outcome. The coefficient(s) for the log\\-transformed data (after resetting the 0 values to $10^{\\-5}$) provide the *extra* association with outcome as MRD values increase above the detection limit.\n\nIt's unlikely that there will be an exactly linear association between the log\\-transformed MRD and outcome. Modeling with a flexible regression spline will let the data tell you the nature of the actual association. With what seem to be many MRD values at or near the left\\-censoring limit, you might want to specify the knots of those regression splines yourself instead of relying on defaults that simply use quantiles of values.\n\nAlso, recognize that the MRD values themselves are subject to substantial measurement error particularly near the left\\-censoring limit. The MRD values in myeloma are typically determined by flow cytometry, with [markers to distinguish normal from abnormal cells](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-021-00328-2). The MRD is the fraction of total cells that are deemed abnormal. If $10^5$ cells are analyzed and none are deemed abnormal, there is still a 5% chance that the actual MRD value [is $3/10^5$ or higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(statistics)). A more sophisticated analysis might incorporate that type of uncertainty into a Bayesian model evaluating survival as a function of measured MRD. That's outside my expertise, but [this page](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/482079/28500) points the way to that type of analysis with left\\-censored predictor values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A hematologist is analyzing Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) data from 360 myeloma patients. The MRD values range from 0 to 7%, with many values at 0 due to the assay's sensitivity limit of 10^-5. The researcher wants to use MRD as a predictor in a regression model for survival outcomes. What is the most appropriate approach to handle this data?\n\nA) Force the MRD values into a normal distribution by applying a log transformation and replacing 0 values with a small constant.\n\nB) Exclude all patients with MRD values of 0 from the analysis to avoid the left-censoring issue.\n\nC) Use the raw MRD values without any transformation in the regression model.\n\nD) Create a binary predictor for censoring, set 0 values to 10^-5, apply a log transformation, and consider using regression splines for flexible modeling.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate approach for several reasons:\n\n1. It acknowledges the left-censoring issue by creating a binary predictor for censored values.\n2. It preserves all data points by setting 0 values to the detection limit (10^-5) rather than excluding them.\n3. The log transformation (suggested as log10(MRD) + 5) helps to handle the wide range of MRD values.\n4. Using regression splines allows for flexible modeling of the potentially non-linear relationship between MRD and outcomes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because forcing normality on predictor variables is unnecessary for regression and doesn't properly address the censoring issue. Option B is problematic as it would discard valuable data. Option C fails to address the left-censoring problem and the wide range of MRD values, which could lead to poor model fit.\n\nThe correct approach (D) aligns with the expert advice in the documentation, addressing the complexities of the data while maximizing the use of available information for the regression model."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/18", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51593", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/11610/"], "docs_id": 51593, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A colleague of mine just got his new MacBook Pro and he ran through the set\\-up process.

It allows for clean handling of interruptions and state changes without relying on nested if-statements or continuous polling.\n3.

I hope this remains true when, more generally, $S$ is a $p$\\-toral group (replacing $\\\\Sigma^{\\\\infty} BS$ by $(\\\\Sigma^{\\\\infty} BS)^{\\\\wedge}\\_p$, because $\\\\Sigma^{\\\\infty} BS$ is no longer $p$\\-complete). Any suggestion or idea?, please.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an argument (not as clean as Piotr's below). Use with caution; it's possible that I've made a mistake. We don't use any properties of $\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BK$ \\-\\- this could be an arbitrary spectrum. But it's crucial that that we use $\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS$ with $S$ a finite $p$\\-group.\n\n**Proposition:** If $S$ is a finite $p$\\-group and $U$ is any spectrum, then $F(\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS, U)$ is $p$\\-complete.\n\nWe will prove this using the following lemmas:\n\n**Lemma 1:** If $S$ is a finite $p$\\-group, then $\\\\tilde H\\_\\\\ast(BS; A) \\= 0$ if $p: A \\\\to A$ is an isomorphism.\n\nAs Piotr points out in his answer, this is a consequence of Maschke's theorem. We provide a proof using basic algebraic topology and finite group theory.\n\n**Proof:** We reduce to the case where $S$ is abelian, where this is a standard calculation. For if $S$ is nonabelian, then there is always a nontrivial short exact sequence $Z(S) \\\\to S \\\\to S / Z(S)$ where $Z(S)$ is the center of $S$. Because $Z(S)$ is the center of $S$, the action of $S/Z(S)$ on $Z(S)$ is trivial. Thus in the Serre spectral sequence $H\\_\\\\ast(B(S/Z(S)); \\\\underline{H\\_\\\\ast(B(Z(S))}) \\\\Rightarrow H\\_\\\\ast(BS)$ we have trivial coefficients. So we can induct on the order of $S$.\n\n**Corollary 2:** Let $S$ be a finite $p$\\-group. Then $\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS$ is $p$\\-local.\n\n**Proof:** Let $\\\\ell \\\\neq p$ be a different prime. The claim is that $\\\\ell: \\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS \\\\to \\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS$ is an equivalence of spectra. It suffices to show that $\\\\ell: \\\\Sigma BS \\\\to \\\\Sigma BS$ is an equivalence of spaces. By the homology Whitehead theorem for field coefficients, it suffices to show that $\\\\ell: \\\\tilde H\\_\\\\ast(BS;k) \\\\to \\\\tilde H\\_\\\\ast(BS;k)$ is an isomorphism for $k \\= \\\\mathbb Q$ or $k \\= \\\\mathbb F\\_q$ with $q$ a prime. But if $k \\= \\\\mathbb Q$ or $k \\= \\\\mathbb F\\_q$ with $q \\\\neq p$, both sides are zero by Lemma 1, while if $k \\= \\\\mathbb F\\_p$, then this follows from $\\\\ell$ being prime to $p$.\n\n**Lemma 3:** Let $T$ be a $p$\\-torsion spectrum \\-\\- i.e. $T$ is $p$\\-local and has trivial rationalization \\-\\- and let $U$ be an arbitrary spectrum. Then $F(T,U)$ is $p$\\-complete.\n\n**Proof:** Let $X$ be such that $X \\\\wedge M(p) \\= 0$; the claim is that $Map(X,F(T,U)) \\= 0$. Equivalently, the claim is that $Map(T, F(X,U)) \\= 0$. Because $T$ is $p$\\-local, it is equivalent to claim that $Map(T, F(X,U)^{(p)}) \\= 0$, where we have taken a $p$\\-colocalization (i.e. we have applied the *right* adjoint $(\\-)^{(p)}$ to the inclusion of the $p$\\-local spectra into all spectra). Then,\n$$F(X,U)^{(p)} \\\\wedge M(p) \\= (F(X,U)\\\\wedge M(p))^{(p)} \\= F(X \\\\wedge \\\\Sigma^{\\-1} M(p), U)^{(p)} \\= 0$$\nThe first equivalence comes because $(\\-)^{(p)}$ commutes with finite colimits, the second by Spanier\\-Whitehead duality, and the third by the hypothesis that $X \\\\wedge M(p) \\= 0$. Since $F(X,U)^{(p)}$ is by definition $p$\\-local, this means that it is *rational*. So\n$$Map(T, F(X,U)^{(p)}) \\= Map\\_{H\\\\mathbb Q}(H\\\\mathbb Q \\\\wedge T, F(X,U)^{(p)}) \\= 0$$\nbecause by hypothesis $H\\\\mathbb Q \\\\wedge T \\= 0$.\n\n**Proof of Proposition:** By Lemma 1, $\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS$ has trivial rationalization, and by Corollary 2, $\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS$ is $p$\\-local. So by Lemma 3, $F(\\\\Sigma^\\\\infty BS, U)$ is $p$\\-complete."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let S be a finite p-group and U be an arbitrary spectrum.

The ground is either the shell of the conduit or its wire is landing on a ground screw on the metal box?\n\nThen sure \\- three pigtails for hot\\-hot\\-neutral and then tie the ground to another screw on the metal box.\n\n\\* Groundless dryer connections are dangerous and I do not recommend their continued use. NFPA says those installed prior to 1996 are \"grandfathered\" (but not if they used 10/2 w/ground cable) but that's still playing with fire. They kill people annually, disproportionately children.\n\n> I was practicing with the twist connectors I have on hand (Ideal\\-brand \"fits\\-all\" which should accommodate 3x10awg)\n\nI'm glad you're practicing first. Failing to use wire\\-nuts correctly causes a lot of series arcing burn\\-ups of wire nuts and potential fires.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"Fits All\". Each size of wire\\-nut is UL\\-approved *for specific combinations of wires*. [Here is Ideal's document on the subject.](https://www.idealind.com/content/dam/electrical/assets/WireTermination/P-5560%20IDEAL%20UL%20Approved%20Wire%20Combination%20Listing03.05.21.pdf) This can get a little weird \\- for instance the Ideal 76B is rated for 1\\-3 \\#10 wires, but at two different voltages (if 3 wires only 300V).\n\nNow, a few pieces of advice on wire nuts.\n\nFirst, it's really ... ideal ... to use wire nuts **in the middle of their range**. If one nut is 2\\-5 \\#10, well two \\#10 is on the small side for that nut but it's just right for three \\#10s. Whereas a nut made for 1\\-3 \\#10s is at the limit of its range for three \\#10s \\- go for the next larger size.\n\nSecond, the golden rule: **Gorilla\\-tight, not monkey\\-tight**. *I know that's the opposite of the rule for everything else*, but on wire nuts you maul the daylights out of that sucker. I would even get the Wing\\-Nut or Twister models as they are easier to grip. Do not use tools \\- you'll crack the nut.\n\nLastly, doing the wire nuts right is pointless if you then limp\\-wrist the screw torques on the socket. Recent science has shown screw torques matter bigtime \\- look at all the talk among EVers about cheap sockets getting hot \\- it's not the socket it's the lack of a torque wrench when they installed it. NEC 2014 requires setting torque correctly on any screw that specifies a torque. On flat blade screws it's kind of a pain \\- critical to select a bit that fits properly \\- but it's worth it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When extending a 240V AC single phase dryer circuit with 10/3 cable, which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of wire connectors (wire nuts)?\n\nA) Any \"fits-all\" wire connector can be safely used as long as it claims to accommodate 3x10AWG wires.\nB) Pre-twisting the wires is always necessary before applying the wire connector, regardless of the manufacturer's instructions.\nC) Wire connectors should be tightened with pliers to ensure a secure connection.\nD) It's best to use wire connectors in the middle of their rated range, and tighten them very firmly by hand.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there's no such thing as a universal \"fits-all\" connector.

I'm also puzzled by G\\=KAK having 3 terms but F\\=RU only 2\\. \n\nGiven all of this, I'm still unsure how these two decompositions are related. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can obtain the $G\\=KAK$ decomposition from a decomposition of the type $F\\=UR$. To avoid unnecessary complications, let's assume that our reductive group $G$ is a selfadjoint subgroup of $\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$. Then the map $g \\\\mapsto g^{\\-t}$ is an involution of $G$, which is called the Cartan involution and is typically denoted by $\\\\theta$. The first observation to make is that the fixed\\-point set $K \\= \\\\{ g \\\\in G \\\\colon \\\\theta(g)\\=g \\\\}$ of $\\\\theta$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. For example, if $G\\=\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$, then $K\\=\\\\operatorname{O}(n)$.\n\nNext we observe that $\\\\theta$ induces an involution (also denoted by $\\\\theta$) at the Lie algebra level: explicitly, this is the map $X \\\\mapsto \\-X^t$. If $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ denotes the $\\-1$\\-eigenspace of this latter involution, then one has the following result.\n\n> The map $K \\\\times \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\to G$ given by $(k, X) \\\\mapsto k e^X$ is a diffeomorphism.\n\nIn particular, every $g \\\\in G$ can be expressed as $k e^X$ for some $k \\\\in K$ and $X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}$. This decomposition is known as the Cartan decomposition; it is a generalization of the polar decomposition to $G$ (and is, I presume, the $F\\=UR$ decomposition stated in the OP). Indeed, if $G \\= \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$, then $\\\\mathfrak{p}$ is just the set of symmetric matrices, and thus the set $\\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{p}$ consists of symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices.\n\nNow let $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ denote a maximal abelian subspace of $\\\\mathfrak{p}$. Then it can be shown that $A \\= \\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{a}$ is a closed abelian subgroup of $G$ with Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak{a}$. It can also be shown that $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ is unique up to conjugacy via an element of $K$. That is to say, if $\\\\mathfrak{a}'$ is another maximal abelian subspace of $\\\\mathfrak{p}$, then there is a $k \\\\in K$ such that $\\\\text{Ad}(k) \\\\mathfrak{a} \\= \\\\mathfrak{a}'$. With this information we can obtain the decomposition $G\\=KAK$: given $g \\\\in G$, one observes that $p\\=gg^t \\\\in \\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{p}$, say $p\\=e^X$. Thus there is a $k \\\\in K$ such that $\\\\text{Ad}(k)X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}$, and then $e^{\\-\\\\text{Ad}(k)X/2}kg \\\\in K$ (because it is fixed by $\\\\theta$), whence $g \\\\in KAK$.\n\nThis hopefully alleviates your 3\\-terms\\-vs\\-2\\-terms issue.\n\nI'm not aware of any relationship between the Iwasawa decomposition and the $KAK$ (polar) decomposition."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the Cartan decomposition of a reductive Lie group G, which is a self-adjoint subgroup of GL(n,\u211d). Which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the Cartan decomposition and the KAK decomposition?\n\nA) The Cartan decomposition G = K exp(\ud835\udd2d) directly implies the KAK decomposition without any further steps.\n\nB) The KAK decomposition is obtained from the Cartan decomposition by choosing any element X from \ud835\udd2d and expressing it as X = kak^(-1) for k \u2208 K and a \u2208 A.\n\nC) To obtain the KAK decomposition from the Cartan decomposition, one must first find a maximal abelian subspace \ud835\udd1e of \ud835\udd2d, then use the fact that any X \u2208 \ud835\udd2d can be conjugated into \ud835\udd1e by an element of K.\n\nD) The Cartan decomposition and KAK decomposition are equivalent, and the terms exp(\ud835\udd2d) and A represent the same subgroup of G.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The Cartan decomposition G = K exp(\ud835\udd2d) is the starting point, but to obtain the KAK decomposition, we need to introduce the maximal abelian subspace \ud835\udd1e of \ud835\udd2d. The key step is recognizing that for any X \u2208 \ud835\udd2d, there exists a k \u2208 K such that Ad(k)X \u2208 \ud835\udd1e. This allows us to write any element g \u2208 G as g = k\u2081ak\u2082, where k\u2081, k\u2082 \u2208 K and a \u2208 A = exp(\ud835\udd1e).\n\nOption A is incorrect because additional steps are needed to go from the Cartan to the KAK decomposition. Option B is incorrect because it misunderstands the role of the maximal abelian subspace and the conjugation process.

After the measurement the state will be projected into a new state, but *which* new state depends on the result of Alice's measurement.  \n\nIf Alice observes state $\\|0\\\\rangle$: $$\\|\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle$$ $$\\|\\\\phi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle$$\r\n\nIf Alice observes state $\\|1\\\\rangle$:$$\\|\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle$$ $$\\|\\\\phi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle$$\r\n\nIf Bob *knows* Alice observes $\\|0\\\\rangle$, then he can distinguish the two states by making a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis. Likewise, if Bob *knows* Alice observes $\\|1\\\\rangle$, then he can distinguish the two states by making a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|\\+\\\\rangle,\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis.  \n\n**But if Bob doesn't know the result of Alice's measurement until *after* he makes his measurement, then he doesn't know *which* measurement to make.**  \n\nIf the true state is $\\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle$ but Bob guesses it's either $\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle$, then he's going to make a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis. This means he's equally likely to observe $\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|1\\\\rangle$, since the true state of his qubit, $\\|\\+\\\\rangle$, is an equal superposition of $\\|0\\\\rangle$ and $\\|1\\\\rangle$. Note that even if the true state of his qubit were $\\|\\-\\\\rangle$ (the only other possibility after Alice's measurement), Bob would still have been equally likely to observe $\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|1\\\\rangle$.  \n\nSo after comparing results, Alice and Bob realize that Bob's measurement tells them nothing, and moreover the result of Alice's measurement by itself does nothing to distinguish the two initial states.  \n\n**Edit:**  \n\nI'm going to try to give a more general rule for which states Alice and Bob can distinguish with local measurements only (no communication until afterwards.)  \n\nIf Alice and Bob aren't going to communicate until their measurements are done, then the combined measurement is effectively chosen before hand. As Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grosshans points out in his answer, this measurement will be a projection into the eigenbasis of $A \\\\otimes B$, where $A$ is a local observable that Alice can measure and $B$ is a local observable that Bob can measure.  \n\nIf $S\\_A$ is the set of eigenstates of $A$, and $S\\_B$ is the set of eigenstates of $B$, then the set of eigenstates of $A \\\\otimes B$ is the direct product (the Cartesian product) of $S\\_A$ and $S\\_B$.  \n\nAs an example, if $S\\_A \\= S\\_B \\= \\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$, Alice and Bob will only distinguish $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$. If $S\\_A \\= \\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ and $S\\_B \\= \\\\{\\|\\+\\\\rangle,\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$, Alice and Bob will only distinguish $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$.  \n\nIf you have a set like my two entangled states above, or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grosshans' four states $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$, then there's no choice of $A$ and $B$ that will suffice, because these states aren't in the direct product of the eigenstates of two local measurements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Alice and Bob are trying to distinguish between two orthogonal two-qubit states:\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9|+\u27e9) / \u221a2 and |\u03c6\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9|1\u27e9 + |1\u27e9|-\u27e9) / \u221a2\nThey are only allowed to perform local measurements and cannot communicate until after both have made their measurements.

Alice and Bob cannot distinguish between |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03c6\u27e9 with certainty using only local measurements without prior communication. This is because the states |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03c6\u27e9 are not in the direct product of the eigenstates of two local measurements. \n\nIf Alice measures in the {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9} basis, the state collapses to either |0\u27e9|0\u27e9 or |0\u27e9|1\u27e9 (if she measures |0\u27e9), or |1\u27e9|+\u27e9 or |1\u27e9|-\u27e9 (if she measures |1\u27e9). Without knowing Alice's measurement result, Bob doesn't know which basis to choose for his measurement. If he chooses the wrong basis, his measurement will not provide any useful information to distinguish between the states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are no local measurements that can always distinguish these states with certainty. Option B is incorrect because even with these specific measurements, they cannot distinguish the states without communicating Alice's result to Bob before his measurement. Option D is incorrect because Bob needs to know Alice's measurement result before choosing his measurement basis to distinguish the states with certainty."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/25", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41861802", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 41861802, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using a Symfony form and I am trying to either remove the label that has appeared or change it to a line of text which accepts spaces.

The paper is somewhat technical and E\\&M is one of my worst subjects.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this question to one better suited, or if you don't have the rep, add a comment suggesting changes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ball lightning could definitely be some atmospheric pressure plasma phenomenon. You can make a pretty impressive ball plasma by discharging a kilojoule\\-scale capacitor bank into a bucket of salt water. Check out [Free\\-Floating Atmospheric Pressure Ball Plasma](http://www.pppl.gov/colloquia_pres/WC17SEP08_GWurden.pdf). In most of those pictures they're using a copper sulfate solution, but that's not essential (sodium chloride also works). These ones only last a (significant) fraction of a second, but I'm sure if you made a larger one (e.g. by a lightning strike), they could last longer.\n\nBTW, this was the subject of a killer science fair project: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=SE6sbaNsKoc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE6sbaNsKoc)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about ball lightning and plasma phenomena is most accurate based on the information given?\n\nA) Ball lightning can only be produced using copper sulfate solutions and high-voltage capacitor banks.\n\nB) The eddy current model proposed by J.D. Shelton in the arXiv article is widely accepted as the definitive explanation for ball lightning.\n\nC) Ball lightning is likely an atmospheric pressure plasma phenomenon that can be replicated on a smaller scale in laboratory conditions.\n\nD) Free-floating atmospheric pressure ball plasma can only exist for microseconds due to rapid energy dissipation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer C is most accurate based on the information provided. The top answer suggests that ball lightning could be an atmospheric pressure plasma phenomenon, which can be replicated in laboratory conditions using methods like discharging a capacitor bank into a salt water solution. While the examples given only last for fractions of a second, it's suggested that larger occurrences (like those from natural lightning strikes) could last longer. This aligns with the characteristics often reported for ball lightning.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text mentions that sodium chloride (table salt) also works, not just copper sulfate. Option B is not supported by the given information, which doesn't comment on the widespread acceptance of Shelton's model.

While there are three nested loops, the innermost loop only executes once per iteration of the second loop, not n times for each iteration.\n\nB) O(n^2) is correct. The innermost loop, despite being nested, only executes once per iteration of the second loop due to the condition (i==j).

The starting point is usually a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,h)$. Then $M$ can be foliated by surfaces $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ of constant $t$, where $t$ is a global time coordinate i.e. a $C^1$ function $t:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}$ such that the 1\\-form $dt$ is non\\-vanishing and everywhere timelike: $h^{\\-1}(dt,dt)\\<0$. Each $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ is a Riemannian 3\\-manifold with metric $g$ inherited from $(M,h)$. The most convenient way to write this metric is $g\\=h\\+n\\\\otimes n$, where $n$ is the normal 1\\-form of $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ with unit length. The lapse and shift are *not* canonical or unique. They are defined with respect to a *choice* of future pointing timelike vector field $\\\\vec{t}$, conventionally normalized by $dt(\\\\vec{t})\\=1$. Then the lapse is $N\\=\\-n(\\\\vec{t})$ and the shift 1\\-form is defined by $\\\\beta(\\\\vec{v})\\=g(\\\\vec{t},\\\\vec{v})$ for all tangent vectors $\\\\vec{v}$. Note that $\\\\beta(\\\\vec{n})\\=0$. Following the integral curves of $\\\\vec{t}$ allows one to construct a diffeomorphism relating the different $\\\\Sigma\\_t$. Then one can interpret the lapse as measuring the proper time between different slices $\\\\Sigma\\_t$, and $\\\\beta$ as measuring the relative velocity of observers that follow the normal $\\\\vec{n}$ and those that follow $\\\\vec{t}$.\n\nThe Einstein equations can be decomposed with respect to a regular slicing, yielding evolution and constraint equations. Different gauge choices \u2013 that is, different choices of $\\\\vec{t}$ \\- are used by relativists to produce different decompositions that have favourable mathematical properties, usually relating to the particular flavour of hyperbolicity of the evolution equations. \n\nSo lapse and shift certainly both carry meaning, but neither is canonically defined inasmuch as they depend upon the choice of $\\\\vec{t}$. The regular sliced form of the metric is indeed natural, in that it arises as described above once one has identified a global time coordinate on the spacetime. \n\nAdded: This attempts to answer the first question(s). I don't think that there is a better response to the second question \\- a slick way of calculating the Christoffel symbols \\- than that given by jc. The alternatives are also standard: a direct coordinate calculation or calculation of the connection 1\\-forms, from which one can read off the Christoffel symbols. \n\nEdit: (In response to Anirbit's queries.) First, about the normal 1\\-form $n$. This is a 1\\-form field on $M$ that is fixed and smooth once the (smooth) foliation by $\\\\Sigma\\_t$'s is specified. So there is no choice at this level. The same holds for the form of the 3\\-metric $g$ on $\\\\Sigma\\_t$: this is just the spacetime 4\\-metric $h$ restricted to tangent vectors to $\\\\Sigma\\_t$: $g\\=h\\+n\\\\otimes n$ is just the most convenient way to wite this metric. \n\nA key point here is that each $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ is a 3 dimensional Riemannian manifold, and so the metric $g$ has signature $(\\+,\\+,\\+)$ at each point. That is, at any point the metric $g$ has three positive eigenvalues \\- where the eigenvectors are tangent to $\\\\Sigma$. This is natural when we take the 3\\-dim perspective. When we think of $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ as being embedded in $M$, and allow $g$ to act on any tangent vector of $M$, we'd say that the signature is $(0,\\+,\\+,\\+)$. The zero eigenvalue corresponds to $n$. \n\nNow we step down one more dimension to consider a spatial 2\\-surface $S$ embedded in $\\\\Sigma\\_t$. A typical example is a 2\\-sphere in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ considered as a slice $t\\=$constant of Minkowski spacetime. The normal $m$ is a spacelike vector orthogonal to $n$. Again, the metric of $S$ is inherited naturally (no choice!) and has the convenient form $g^\\\\prime \\= h\\+n\\\\otimes n \\- m\\\\otimes m$. The minus sign arises to make sure we get the right signature $(0,0,\\+,\\+)$ for $g^\\\\prime$: without this signature \\- and without the minus sign \\- we would not have a Riemannian metric for $S$. The source of the sign difference is that $n$ is timelike, but $m$ is spacelike."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a regularly sliced semi-Riemannian metric of the form ds^2 = -N^2(\u03b8^0)^2 + g_ij \u03b8^i \u03b8^j, what does the lapse function N represent?\n\nA) The proper time between different slices \u03a3_t\nB) The relative velocity of observers following normal n\u20d7 and those following t\u20d7\nC) The global time coordinate t\nD) The normal 1-form of \u03a3_t\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The lapse function N represents the proper time between different slices \u03a3_t in a regularly sliced semi-Riemannian metric.

Find a way to mark each stake at the same height. A laser level would be easiest. If you don't have one of those, you can get string\\-line levels that hang from a string between each stake. \n\nOnce you have 4 level marks, you can now figure where the mark should be on the high end. Figure out where you want the top of the patio to be, then subtract the height of the brick. This will be where the sand base has to come up to. Now measure from that point to the original level mark you made. Let's say that's 4\".\n\nNow figure out the slope you need for the two adjoining corners. Most say you want the slop to be 1/8 \\- 1/4\" per foot. \n\nSo if this is a 10' patio, and we want 1/4\" per foot, that'd be a total slope of 2\\.5\". Mark these two corners at 6\\.5\" below your level mark. (4 \\+ 2\\.5\\). \n\nNow for the last corner (opposite the first) we'd mark that at 9\" below level (6\\.5 \\+ 2\\.5\\). \n\nYou now have the 4 corners marked at the proper slope. \n\nAfter you get your grave base compacted, bring in the sand, and put down screed guides to line up with each of these points. I like using conduit for this. Not too pricey and comes in long lengths. Lay your screed on these as you go along to keep a consistent slope to the sand base. \n\nNow, with this example, the outside edge of the patio is 9\" lower than the high end of the wall. That's a pretty big difference.

For the 16' length: 16 * 1/4\" = 4\"\n\nThe total height difference will be the sum of these two slopes plus the initial 4\" height at the high point:\n\n4\" (initial height) + 3\" (width slope) + 4\" (length slope) = 11\"\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the highest and lowest points, so we subtract the initial height:\n\n11\" - 4\" = 7\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 7 inches.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it doesn't account for the full slope across both dimensions.\nOption C is close but slightly overestimates the slope.\nOption D significantly overestimates the required slope."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/05", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/369395", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/137472/"], "docs_id": 369395, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the input data with 5 columns separate by tabs:\n\n```\nClass1,Class2 info1 info2 info3 info4\nClass3 info1a info2a info3a info4a\nClass4,Class5 info1b info2b1,info2b2 info3b info4b\n\n```\n\nWhen I have, in the first column, data separate by comma, I would like to separate it by different rows with same information from the 2nd\\-5th columns, for example:\n\n```\nClass1 info1 info2 info3 info4\nClass2 info1 info2 info3 info4\nClass3 info1a info2a info3a info4a\nClass4 info1b info2b1,info2b2 info3b info4b\nClass5 info1b info2b1,info2b2 info3b info4b\n\n```\n\nI have no idea how to do that. Any suggestion?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, you can simplify your problem by cutting out one of the middle processes: there is no reason here for you to use `sh -c` to launch your process. In fact, it's potentially less secure, if your actual command line is dynamically constructed. Instead of:\n\n```\nexecl(\"/bin/sh\",\"sh\",\"-c\",\"sudo nmap -sS -A 192.168.0.1/24\",NULL);\n\n```\n\nYou should just do:\n\n```\nexeclp(\"sudo\", \"sudo\", \"nmap\", \"-sS\", \"-A\", \"192.168.0.1/24\", NULL);\n\n```\n\nNow you have just two processes: the `sudo` and the `nmap` itself. You know the process ID of the parent (`sudo`) but you don't know the process ID of the child (`nmap`). But it doesn't matter, because you can use a feature of `sudo`: kill the parent (with `SIGTERM`) and it will forward the signal along to the child for you.\n\nYour last remaining problem isn't directly related to the question you're asking, but it's that anyway you probably don't have permission to kill either of these processes anyway! Since `sudo` is involved, which has as its purpose to elevate its privilege, you probably don't have permission to send it or its child signals in the first place."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're developing a program that needs to execute a privileged command using sudo.

It directly executes sudo with the desired command as arguments, avoiding the potential security risks associated with using a shell (as in option A). It also uses execlp, which searches for the executable in the PATH, making it more portable. Options C and D are less ideal: C uses execv which requires a full path and doesn't search PATH, while D uses execle which is unnecessarily complex for this scenario as it passes the environment explicitly. The key here is to avoid using a shell when unnecessary and to directly execute the privileged command, which option B accomplishes most effectively."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/02", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/257269", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/104521/"], "docs_id": 257269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm new in PyQGIS and wrote a script to read a polygon and get the centroid:\n\n```\nfrom qgis.PyQt.QtGui import *\nfrom qgis.PyQt.QtCore import *\n\n# insert the location of the shp\nlayer = iface.addVectorLayer(\"/media/path/Setor_Censit_Urb_Cast_2010.shp\", \"Setor\", \"ogr\")\nlayer2 = QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326', 'MyPoint' , 'memory')\n\npts = [] \n\n# save the centroid as vector\nprov = layer2.dataProvider()\npoints = []\nfor feature in layer.getFeatures():\n    geometry = feature.geometry()\n    centroid = geometry.centroid().asPoint()\n    pts = [centroid]\n    name = feature.attribute(\"CD_GEOCODI\") # select the attribute\n\n# Insert the coordinates in the layer2 shapefile\n    for x,y in pts:\n            feat = QgsFeature()\n            point = QgsPoint(x,y)\n            feat.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(point))\n            points.append(feat)\nprov.addFeatures(points)\n\n# update extent of the layer\nlayer2.updateExtents()\n\n# add the layer to the layers panel\nQgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([layer2])\n\n```\n\nBut I want the attributes too.

We're fine with you asking something like this on MSU, since we'd get notified and we'd be able to answer you more quickly.\n\nLets start with the question ban. While its automatic, and the exact rules for getting unbanned are not known to us, we can apply some basic numbers and common sense to it. *This ban was not put in place, nor can it be removed by moderators*\n\nYou have 13 closed questions of 40 questions in total, including one where a question was closed and you asked the exact same question again (This is not productive. Improve closed questions, and it goes back in the reopen queue. Do a good enough job, and they do get reopened).\n\nOk, slightly over a quarter of your questions. That's pretty bad but I've seen worse. A bunch of the existing questions are zero score, which might have contributed to it. Many of these were auto\\-deleted due to lack of answers (not out fault, its how the system works).\n\nHere's what we *can* do however \\- some of your questions are roombaed. I'll review out those that were deleted and not user closed (so there's nothing wrong with them except a *lack of love*),and I'll take a look at them, and try to reopen those that meet quality standards.\n\nHowever, I won't do this all at once (no point flooding the front page, and its a fair but of work) and I *cannot* promise this will lift the ban, or that the questions will not get reclosed in time if they are dead again. \n\nOn your part, you may want to edit those that you think can be improved. I believe you can always view your own deleted questions. Let me know if you need a link to these. Focus on ones with *no* closevotes and are deleted, or can be logically salvaged, not the ones that got hit by 5 off topic closevotes and such.\n\nIf any are marginal, we'll need to talk about fixing them and how, and letting me know if the ban is lifted would be awesome. \n\nEDIT: And since I had a bit of time, here's the deleted questions on your list and some comments about them.

As an example, say that local sports fans are getting excited about a relatively new coach in town \u2013 one cynical fan might say, *\"I'm not ready to drink the Harbaugh Kool\\-Aid,\"* meaning roughly, *\"I don't think everything Coach Harbaugh says is necessarily correct.\"* \n\nConversely, I've heard *\"drank the Kool\\-Aid\"* used to express that someone *was* ready to take someone else at their word: \n\n> *\"I'm not sure that was such a good trade our team made.\"*  \n> \n> *\"I don't know \u2013 I've drunk the Harbaugh Kool\\-Aid.\"*\n\nThat dialog implies the second speaker is impressed with Coach Harbaugh, and prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, even if he does have some misgivings about some of the decisions made by the coach.\n\nWhatever comment you made in your debate, someone thought it seemed too \"multicultural\" (which was perhaps another word for \"politically correct?\"), and so they used the Kool\\-Aid reference to express their disapproval, ostensibly on behalf of the rest of the regulars in that forum."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The phrase \"drink the Kool-Aid\" is often used in modern discourse to express:\n\nA) A willingness to consume sugary beverages\nB) Blind adherence to a particular ideology or leader\nC) A preference for certain brands of soft drinks\nD) The act of literally drinking poisoned beverages\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"drink the Kool-Aid\" originates from the 1978 Jonestown tragedy where followers of Jim Jones consumed poisoned Kool-Aid, resulting in mass deaths. In modern usage, it has evolved to metaphorically mean accepting or following an idea, philosophy, or leader without critical thought or questioning. \n\nOption A is incorrect as it takes the phrase too literally and misses its figurative meaning. \n\nOption B is correct because it accurately captures the modern usage of the phrase, which implies unquestioning acceptance of ideas or leadership.\n\nOption C is also incorrect as it focuses on brand preference, which is unrelated to the phrase's meaning.\n\nOption D, while related to the phrase's origin, is incorrect in the context of its modern usage, which is figurative rather than literal.\n\nIn the given context, \"multicultural Kool-Aid\" is used to suggest that the speaker refuses to blindly accept multiculturalist ideas or ideology, demonstrating the phrase's application to specific belief systems or social concepts."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/25", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/58881", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/22414/"], "docs_id": 58881, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a counter to Yorick on top?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yorick actually has very little means of escaping, so if he is ganked from early on he can be gimped enough to the point where he is not a large threat. He becomes incredibly tanky, so make sure you try to get him early. The later you gank him, the more levels in Omen of Famine he'll have and be much tankier. Once he's level 3 he also will be able to throw up all 3 ghouls for 15% damage reduction making him very tanky. Many champions can lane against him by farming his ghouls. They give no gold, but Tryndamere and Nasus scale better into late game and give them means of gaining strength in lane. Tryndamere gets it by hitting the ghouls for rage buildup and actually end up healing off of his skills from lifesteal and Bloodlust. Nasus gets power by building Siphoning Strike charges off of the ghouls.\n\nSource: [http://www.lolpro.com/guides/yorick/65\\-yorick\\-guide\\-top\\-lane/tips\\-tricks\\-synergies\\-and\\-counters](http://www.lolpro.com/guides/yorick/65-yorick-guide-top-lane/tips-tricks-synergies-and-counters)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about countering Yorick in the top lane is NOT accurate according to the provided information?\n\nA) Ganking Yorick early is more effective than ganking him later in the game.\nB) Tryndamere can effectively lane against Yorick by using his ghouls to build rage and heal.\nC) Nasus can gain power by using Siphoning Strike on Yorick's ghouls.\nD) Yorick's ghouls provide gold when killed, making them a valuable farming target for the enemy laner.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: The passage states that ganking Yorick early is more effective, as he becomes tankier later with levels in Omen of Famine.\nB is correct: The text mentions that Tryndamere can use Yorick's ghouls to build rage and heal through lifesteal and Bloodlust.\nC is correct: The passage explicitly states that Nasus can build Siphoning Strike charges by killing Yorick's ghouls.\nD is incorrect: The text specifically mentions that Yorick's ghouls \"give no gold,\" contradicting this statement.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to carefully analyze the given information and identify false statements among true ones."}}
