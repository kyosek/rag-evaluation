But it's also possible to have more than one set of binaries (say the 32 bit and the 64 bit varieties): all you need is to have the correct pointer in the `PATH` variable.\n\nA method that I find very easy to manage is to create a symbolic link:\n\n```\nln -s /data/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux /usr/texbin\n\n```\n\n(or `/opt/texbin` if one prefers) and use `/usr/texbin` in the PATH variable.

I want to investigate within group differences. All time/condition points are important, I don't have a \"control\" time point.\n\nAny opinions on the following:\n\n1. If I am comfortable that sphericity is assumed by Mauchly's Test not being violated, would a multivariate Lambda F test statistic be more appropriate or a sphericity assumed estimate (within\\-condition estimate from SPSS)?\n2. If I choose to go with the understanding that despite a test result saying it is OK, assuming sphericity may still be over\\-confident, any thoughts on potentially reporting ALL\nGreenhouse\\-Geiser estimates regardless of Mauchly's or Lambda? I have read that this may reduce the chance of a Type\\-1 error without having to assume sphericity or equality of covariance matrices. Perhaps too overcautious? Or, is potentially adjusting df's more invasive than assuming sphericity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: so... here is a bit of a dog's breakfast of suggestions\n\nThere are more ways to approach this than the options you give yourself. One of them might be to take your three reward levels, one being neutral, and turn them into two reward effects. So, if C is neutral reward, and A and B are test levels makes up an A effect (A\\-C) and a B effect (B\\-C) and then compare them to each other. Because there are only two levels sphericity is not an issue. And then you're actually comparing your two effects. Do *not* make the mistake of testing A\\-C, and finding it significant and B\\-C, and finding it not, and then concluding there's a difference between A\\-C, and B\\-C. The difference between those two may not be significant in itself.\n\nMauchly's test, like all such tests, isn't terribly useful. It will fail all of the time with enought power, even if the sphericity violation isn't too bad and you can pass it all of the time with very low power. It definitely shouldn't be used like a hypothesis test in the Neyman\\-Pearson sense. No test of assumptions should be. Meeting your assumptions is a qualitative decision and Mauchly can help you with that but it's not used as a hard decision rule. Along those same lines, always using GG corrections can reduce the amount of Type I error that you make, as you inquired. However, it can also increase the amount of Type II. \n\nAnd assuming sphericity isn't invasive at all... Describing it that way makes it sounds like you have a little bit too much reverence for your data and believe there's some church of decisions here. If you want to be conservative in your tests, GG everything and Bonferroni correct. But, if you do that, recognize that you're possibly making Type II errors and note that in your write up. If you don't want to do any of that then don't, but make sure that then you draw weaker conclusions about your tests, especially multiple ones and use them to point the way for future researchers to look.\n\nIf you want to go multivariate knock yourself out. It helps with the sphericity issue, if there is one. It doesn't fix multiple testing issues. But you should pick one beforehand and stick with it, not run all kinds of different analyses and see which makes your results look better. That's a whole different level of multiple comparisons. Posting your actual Mauchly test numbers and GG corrections on here might result in you getting some expert advice on how large a violation they are. It's unlikely they're big given that you only have 3\\-levels.\n\nSpeaking of 3\\-levels, there are no GG corrections for when you have two levels. There is no test of sphericity then. If you decide to make three comparisons, A\\-B, A\\-C, B\\-C, then none of these if GG corrected.\n\nA final option you haven't mentioned is to calculate confidence intervals for each of your 3 comparisons and speak about them rationally. You could alpha adjust them if you wish, or even put two levels of bars on a graph. Then you just describe what are likely and unlikely to be the true values of the effect. So, if A\\-C does not cross 0 then 0 is an unlikely value. Only the values within the CI are likely.\n\nAs you can see, the reason you haven't gotten hard answers to your questions is that, despite your having formulated them well, there are only hard answers to small aspects of what you want to know. That can get firmer when someone has real numbers and hypotheses to deal with. To get more specific help in your description, multiple comparison issues, and some expert advice on how to treat your data, then make a new query with your analyses posted, numbers and what they mean, what your hypotheses are, and what you hope to find out or discuss. That will be more likely to land you some hard advice that's useful."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a study with two groups of equal sample size, measuring each group over 3 time points (representing different monetary reward conditions).

Increasing to \u00b150V DC significantly increases the power dissipation in the voltage dropping resistors from about 110mW to 5.6W, far exceeding their 1W rating. Simply changing the resistance value or increasing the power rating doesn't address the fundamental issue of excessive voltage. Other components in the amplifier are likely also rated only for the original voltage.

Well, that doesn't matter to me the caller if I'm going to immediately unpack the results:\n\n```\nscore, top_player = play_round(players)\n# or\nidx, record = find_longest(records)\n\n```\n\nThere's no reason here for me to care if it's a list or a tuple, and the tuple is simpler on both sides.\n\nOn the other hand, if the returned collection is going to be kept whole and used *as a collection*:\n\n```\npoints = calculate_vertices(shape)\npoints.append(another_point)\n# Make a new shape\n\n```\n\nthen it might make sense for the return to be mutable. Homogeneity is also an important factor here. Say you've written a function to search a sequence for repeated patterns. The information I get back is the index in the sequence of the first instance of the pattern, the number of repeats, and the pattern itself. Those aren't the same kinds of thing. Even though I might keep the pieces together, there's no reason that I would want to mutate the *collection*. This is not a `list`.\n\nNow for the dictionary.\n\n> the last one creates more readable code because you have named outputs\n\nYes, having keys for the fields makes heterogenous data more explicit, but it also comes with some encumbrance.

Keyed access over there will absolutely help understandability.\n\nThe third question \\-\\- reuse \\-\\- points to a simple custom datatype as a fourth option that you didn't present.\n\nIs the structure solely owned by this one function? Or are you creating the same dictionary layout in many places? Do many other parts of the program need to operate on this structure? A repeated dictionary layout should be factored out to a class.

When a sine wave is clipped due to an inadequate transformer, the full-wave rectification meter will overestimate the voltage compared to a true RMS meter. This is because full-wave rectification meters are calibrated based on the relationship between the average value (63.7% of peak) and RMS value (70.7% of peak) for a perfect sine wave. When the wave is clipped, this relationship no longer holds true, leading to an overestimation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the two types of meters will give different readings when there's waveform distortion, such as clipping or harmonic distortion.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the full-wave rectification meter will overestimate, not underestimate, the voltage when the sine wave is clipped.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially misleading.

I am by no means an expert in string theory and higher dimensions. I'm a 7th grader who recently wanted to learn about the 4th dimension. I would ask that you please try a bit to keep this in mind in your answer.\n\nRecently, I have learned that superstring theory claims that there are 10 spatial dimension existing in our world. How would that be possible in a 3 dimensional universe? If there is an actual \"4th dimension\" out there, it would have to exist as a subset of a 3 dimensional universe, which simply does not make sense. Or, you could be saying that it exists outside our universe, which means there is an edge to the universe, or at least the 3D part of it, meaning you could stick your hand out and be in two dimensions at once? That also doesn't make any sense. So, how can string theory claim there are more than 3 spatial dimensions in our world?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I have learned that superstring theory claims that there are 10 spatial dimension existing in our world. How would that be possible in a 3 dimensional universe?\n\nIf the universe has 10 dimensions, then it is 10\\-dimensional and only *appears* 3\\-dimensional. The other 7 spatial dimensions would have to be very \"small\" dimensions. An analogy would be a sheet of paper, which is 3\\-dimensional but appears 2 dimensional because one dimension, it's thickness, is very small compared to the others.\n\n> If there is an actual \"4th dimension\" out there, it would have to exist as a subset of a 3 dimensional universe, which simply does not make sense.\n\nActually, the 3\\-dimensional universe would be a subset of the 10\\-dimensional universe and \"fit inside\" it, the way a line fits on a piece of paper and a piece of paper fits inside a box.\n\n> Or, you could be saying that it exists outside our universe, which means there is an edge to the universe, or at least the 3D part of it, meaning you could stick your hand out and be in two dimensions at once?\n\nThere doesn't have to be an edge to anything, so long as the dimensions in question are unbounded. You can imagine an infinitely long line, for example, which has \"edges\" (boundaries) in two dimensions but not in the third. That line could have two similar lines orthogonal to it, and orthogonal to each other, and each of those infinite lines could act as the axis of one of our three dimensions in space, which also would then be infinite. Closed shapes can also be finite without having an 'end' or 'edge:' where is the edge of a circle, for example? If you think about it, when you stretch out your hand, you're not just in two dimensions at once, but three: but even though each of those three dimensions has \"edges\" of its own, in that it is only one dimension itself, the universe doesn't have an edge... That we can see at least.\n\nOn the topic of \"curled up\" dimensions, I'll give another analogy: if you've ever played the classic arcade game Asteroids, (check it out at freeasteroids.org if you haven't,) you're familiar with the concept of a small, closed dimension: when you go a certain distance in one direction, you come to what looks like an edge, but its not really an edge because you wrap back around to the other side of the screen. The left \"edge\" is connected to the right \"edge,\" and the top and bottom \"edges\" are also connected to each other. Each of the two dimensions in that game is a small (only a few inches) curled dimension. Your ship can travel in the same direction forever without ever leaving your computer screen. Now, imagine that in the real world there are closed dimensions like that, but instead of being a few inches like the Asteroids game, each dimension is about the size of subatomic particle like an electron: that's what string theory supposes the other seven spatial dimensions we *can't* see are like."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to string theory, which of the following best describes the nature of the additional spatial dimensions beyond the three we commonly experience?\n\nA) They exist outside our universe and can be accessed by reaching the edge of our 3D space.\n\nB) They are large dimensions that we simply cannot perceive due to our limited senses.\n\nC) They are very small, \"curled up\" dimensions that exist within our seemingly 3D universe.\n\nD) They are theoretical constructs that don't actually exist in physical reality.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to string theory, the additional spatial dimensions are thought to be extremely small and \"curled up\" within our apparently 3-dimensional universe. This is analogous to how a sheet of paper appears 2-dimensional because its thickness is very small compared to its other dimensions. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the extra dimensions are not thought to exist outside our universe or require reaching an \"edge\" of space. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because these extra dimensions are not large, but extremely small, which is why we don't directly perceive them.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while these dimensions are theoretical, string theory proposes that they do exist in physical reality, just at a scale too small for us to easily detect or interact with."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/27", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/18146", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/4763/"], "docs_id": 18146, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The two senses of this word seem very different.

We can calculate the zeta function of a disjoint union by the formula $Z(X\\\\amalg Y,t)\\=Z(X,t)Z(Y,t)$. There is also a formula for $Z(X\\\\times Y,t)$ in terms of $Z(X,t)$ and $Z(Y,t)$, but this is slightly more complicated. In fact, these two formulas are precisely the standard big Witt vector addition and multiplication law on the set $1\\+t\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[\\[t]]$. (Actually, there's more than one standard normalization, so you have to get the right one. I believe this ring structure was first written down by Grothendieck in his appendix to Borel\\-Serre, but I don't know who first made the connection with the ring of Witt vectors as defined earlier by Witt.) If we let $K\\_0$ be the Grothendieck group on the isomorphism classes of such schemes, where addition is disjoint union and multiplication is cartesian product, then we get a ring map $K\\_0\\\\to 1\\+t\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[\\[t]]$. We could also do all this with the L\\-factor $L(X,s)\\=Z(X,q^{\\-s})$ (where $q$ is the cardinality of the finite field) instead of the zeta function. This is because they determine each other.\n\nThis is all good. The problem I have is when there is bad reduction. So now let $X$ be a scheme of finite type over $\\\\mathbf{Q}$ (say). Then the L\\-factor $L\\_p(X,s)$ is defined by \n$$L\\_p(X,s)\\=\\\\mathrm{det}(1\\-F\\_p p^{\\-s}\\|H(X,\\\\mathbf{Q}\\_{\\\\ell})^{I\\_p}),$$\nwhere $I\\_p$ is the inertia group at $p$. (Sorry, I'm not going to explain the rest of the notation.) If $I$ acts trivially (in which case one might say $X$ has good reduction), then taking invariants under $I$ does nothing, and so as above, the L\\-factor of a product and sum of varieties is determined by the individual L\\-factors. If $I$ does not act trivially, then the L\\-factor of a sum is again the product of the individual L\\-factors, but for products there is no such formula! (The following should be an example showing this. Take $X\\=\\\\mathrm{Spec}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Q}(i)$, $Y\\=\\\\mathrm{Spec}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{2})$. The we have the following Euler factors at 2: $L\\_2(X,s)\\=L\\_2(Y,s)\\=L\\_2(X\\\\times Y,s)\\=1\\-2^{\\-s}$ and $L\\_2(X\\\\times X,s)\\=(1\\-2^{\\-s})^2$. So the L\\-factors of two schemes do not determine that of the product.) Therefore the usual Euler factor cannot possibly give a ring map defined on the Grothendieck ring of varieties over $\\\\mathbf{Q}$.\n\nSo, is there a way of fixing this problem? I would guess the answer is No, because while some people might allow you to scale Euler factors by numbers, I don't think anyone will let you change them by anything else. But maybe there is some \"refined L\\-factor\" that determines the usual one (and maybe incorporates the higher cohomology of the inertia group?) Assuming there is no known way of repairing things, I have a follow\\-up question: Is there some general formalism that handles this failure? And if so, how does that work? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: James: given that no\\-one else answered this yet, let me just make some naive comments that you probably know already. \n\nOf course the problem is that if $I\\_p$ isn't acting trivially, then \"taking $I\\_p$\\-invariants\" isn't as functorial as you'd like it to be. For example consider two 1\\-dimensional ($\\\\ell$\\-adic, or even complex) representations $\\\\rho\\_1$ and $\\\\rho\\_2$ of $D\\_p$, a decomposition group at $p$, each with $I\\_p$ acting non\\-trivially, and with $I\\_p$ also acting non\\-trivially on $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes\\\\rho\\_2$. Then the local $L$\\-factors of $\\\\rho\\_1$, $\\\\rho\\_2$ and $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes\\\\rho\\_2$ are all just 1, but the local $L$\\-factor of $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes(\\\\rho\\_1^{\\-1})$ is clearly not 1\\. In some sense this example is even simpler than the example you give.\n\nBut what the example is supposed to stress is the underlying basic problem (which presumably you know already): if $G$ is group acting on f.d. vector spaces $M\\_1$ and $M\\_2$, then $M\\_1^G\\\\otimes M\\_2^G$ can easily be strictly smaller than $(M\\_1\\\\otimes M\\_2\\)^G$. Hence the moment one considers the local Euler factor (which depends only on the $G$\\-invariants, where here $G$ is the inertia subgroup) one has lost too much information.\n\nBut why not simply consider the ring of isomorphism classes of $\\\\ell$\\-adic representations of $D\\_p$ instead? That's a perfectly good ring, and it has direct sums and tensor products, and presumably if you consider virtual representations too then maybe you can see maps from the ring you mention above to this ring (via Kunneth?). Perhaps this ring is \"too coarse\" for you? I'm not sure. But, if it is, and you're after some finer invariant, then *surely* the invariant will depend only on the action of $D\\_p$. So at least this observation somehow removes all the geometry from the question, which now perhaps is \"give me a quotient ring of the ring of reps of $D\\_p$\" that still distinguishes non\\-isomorphic unramified representations\" or something.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: (major addition to answer). Overnight I realised that really all the answer above was saying was the following. You want to find a map from the Grothendieck ring to \"zeta\\-functions\". I am suggesting that we start by factoring this map into three pieces. I now realise that I am a bit hazy as to whether this can be done. First I am suggesting that we start by sending a variety to the corresponding motive. Now already I realise I might be in trouble, because I think a motive always has realisations, which are representations, and something in your Grothendieck ring might sometimes only have a virtual rep attached to it. But let me ignore this issue. Next I want to go from motives to their realisations (rep of $D\\_p$ on an $\\\\ell$\\-adic vector space). Now I want to go from this representation to its $L$\\-function (defined as in the question), and I want to claim that your map (I am confused about your map though because I don't know whether you're fixing a degree of cohomology or looking at all degrees at once and taking an alternating sum) factors somehow as a composite of these 3 maps. Finally I am claiming that your complaints are only about the last map, so really your question is purely representation\\-theoretic. I am not sure whether I am right about this formalism, so I wanted to flag it explicitly.\n\nNext, here's an exercise you might want to try. The group $I\\_p$ has a pro\\-$\\\\ell$ component so it might have some higher cohomology on $\\\\ell$\\-adic vector spaces. I suspect that $D\\_p/I\\_p$ acts on $H^i(I\\_p,M\\_\\\\ell)$ for all $i$. Why not take the alternating product of these and then take char poly of Frobenius? Stab in the dark!

In this case, we would compare (200^2) to (20^2).\nD) Adding a constant to all observations doesn't change the spread of the data and wouldn't help in comparing reliability.\n\nThe correct approach is to use variances, as they provide a more statistically sound basis for comparing the spread of distributions, especially when the difference in variability is large."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/21", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51765", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/23052/"], "docs_id": 51765, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just bound my MacBook Pro to my Active Directory domain, so when I opened Mail and set up my email account, it asked if I'd like to remember in the keychain.

When an electron and proton are bound say within a hydrogen atom, are there any measurable effects upon the proton when its electron goes through the process of absorbing, obtaining a higher energy state, releasing an identical photon, and returning to its ground state?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mode expansion of the EM field usually uses modes that are delocalized in space. Photons are basically\\* *quanta of amplitude* of corresponding modes. This means that they indeed correspond to delocalized excitations of the EM field.\n\nJust as with electrons in quantum mechanics, we can localize a single photon to a wave packet by superposing several single\\-photon states with *different* excited modes. This will no longer be the \"pure\" photon with a definite frequency that we discussed above. But it's the cost of localization. We see the same result when forming a wave packet from electron's definite\\-momentum states.\n\nBut, just as electrons, in interactions the photons, however delocalized their wavefunction is, act as *point\\-like* objects. Whenever something absorbs or scatters a photon, this happens (from a classical observer's point of view) at a particular spot, and only a single spot for a single absorption event. Examples of such interaction are registration of a photon by a pixel on a photographic sensor, or polymerization of a patch of [photoresist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresist) in a lithographic process.\n\n---\n\n\\*I discuss this in a bit more detail in the last section of [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/630627/21441), that, although talking about phonons, is also relevant to photons."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of quantum electrodynamics and the interaction between photons and matter, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Photons always behave as perfectly localized particles during absorption and emission processes.\n\nB) The wavefunction of a photon is always delocalized, preventing any point-like interactions with matter.\n\nC) Photons can be described as both delocalized wave-like excitations and point-like particles in interactions, depending on the context.\n\nD) The absorption of a photon by an atom always results in multiple simultaneous excitation events at different locations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This question tests understanding of the dual nature of photons in quantum electrodynamics. The key points from the documentation are:\n\n1. Photons are typically described as quanta of amplitude in delocalized electromagnetic field modes.\n2. It's possible to create more localized photon wave packets by superposing different single-photon states, similar to electron wave packets.\n3.

But the general rule is that equations that are positioned as regular 'objects' in the text are shown in small 'inline style', while equations that are put on their own lines are allowed to be shown in their full, expanded, glory. This is not a bug, but a feature, and indeed what you normally want!\n\nMost often, you don't put very complex formulae 'inline', so you might not notice the difference in formatting very often. For instance, it is not visible in the example below.\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyfyz.png)\n\nHowever, this (nonsensical) example shows the change\\-of\\-formatting in action:\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCjaX.png)\n\nSurely it wouldn't look good if the inlined sum was expanded! My point is that the default formatting is almost always what you want.\n\nStill, you can change it to some extent. If the formula is on its own line, then you can choose if you want the sum to have its limits above or to the right. Simply right\\-click any of the limits and choose \"Change limit positions\" (or whatever the menu item may be called in the English version of Microsoft Word). However, if the formula is part of a line of regular text, this option is not available, but as I suggested above, there would hardly never be any reason to change the default formatting if you are writing a professional\\-looking document.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions. For instance, Microsoft Word 2010 has no feature to number equations. In fact, this was easier before the new formula editor was introduced in Microsoft Word 2007\\. Indeed, using the Equation Editor 3\\.0 OLE object in Office Word 2003 and earlier versions, you could create a centred tab stop at the middle of the page, and a right\\-aligned tab stop at the right margin, and then you could manually number your equations. This simple approach is not possible in Word 2007 and later, because if the formula is not alone on the paragraph, it will be shrunk to \u2018inline style\u2019. Now, it seems that the only reasonable way to number an equation is to use a 3\u00d71 table with a total width of 100 % of the page, and individual cell widths of 10 %, 80 %, and 10 % (say). The middle cell aligns its text at the centre, and here you put the formula. Since the formula is alone in its paragraph (indeed, in the entire cell), it will be rendered the right way.

Equations that are positioned as regular 'objects' in the text (inline) are shown in a small 'inline style', while equations that are put on their own lines are allowed to be shown in their full, expanded form.

When plugging my headphones there is a constant screeching sound, almost similar to a mosquito flying near your ear. I can play normal sounds, but this screeching remains as background. The internal speakers work absolutely fine. And it's not a fault in my headphones (tested two different pairs), since they don't play such sound when booting in Windows.\n\nThis seems to be a common issue, since I have found a lot of other posts aksing for help. The reason I am opening a new thread is that so far none of the offered solutions have worked for me. Therefore, I wanted to try my luck here again, I will try to outline my results for the most common solutions.\n\nBut first I will probably need to give some specifications for my laptop.\n\nThe model is the Acer Nitro 5 AN515\\-55\\-73C9 with an Intel i\\-7 10750H processor. The graphics card is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, *however* in Kubuntu I deactivated it using the NVIDIA X Server Settings and switched to the integrated Intel UHD Graphics, since this boosts my battery life from 1\\.5 hours to 8 hours and I only really need it for some gaming on Windows. **The screeching sound does not appear when instead using the NVIDIA graphics card** (Perfomance mode in NVIDIA X Server Settings). **However**, using this setting permanently is not an option for me due to the extremely short battery life. Also, I know from my old laptop that it's possible to not have this screeching sound when using the Intel UHD Graphics since there the problem does not arise when switching to Intel in the NVIDIA X Server Settings. I want to avoid using the RTX 2060 in Kubuntu at all cost, so that's why I am asking for help.\n\nAs additional information, I saw in some forum someone recommend to include the output of `lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 audio`, so here it is, even though I am not sure what this command does, I'm guessing it shows which soundcard is present.\n\n```\n00:1f.3 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation Comet Lake PCH cAVS [8086:06c8]\n        Subsystem: Acer Incorporated [ALI] Device [1025:143d]\n        Kernel driver in use: snd_hda_intel\n\n```\n\nIf you need any more information just let me know!\n\nFailed solutions\n----------------\n\nSo first I want to go through the suggestions in this thread: [Strange noise in headphones when no sound is played](https://askubuntu.com/questions/457910/strange-noise-in-headphones-when-no-sound-is-played)\n\nThe person asking the question includes the output of `sudo aplay -l`, so here you go\n\n```\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC295 Analog [ALC295 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 10: HDMI 4 [HDMI 4]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n```\n\nSo the first solution suggests to disable `loopback` in `alsamixer`, however, there is no such option available for me:\n[alsamixer with headphones plugged in](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ftNTg.png)\n\nThe next solution suggests to enter the commands\n\n```\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save_controller\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\n```\n\nbut this does practically nothing. The sounds stops for a split second but is immidiately back. Also as additional information, the screeching is there both in plugged in and plugged out mode.\n\nThe next one suggests to edit the file\n\n```\nsudo nano /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/intel-audio-powersave\n\n```\n\nbut this file doesn't exist in my system.\n\nSo the next solution is one that I have found in a lot of other threads and it seemed to have worked for most people (unfortunately not for me). The idea is the edit `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf` and add the line\n\n```\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-headset-multi\n\n```\n\nat the end. For me this changes the volume of the screeching, slightly lowering it, but it's still to loud to overhear. I saw on some website, which I can't find right now (I believe it was some sort of Ubuntu wiki), that one could try different options for the `model` options. I have found the available options for my sound card [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/sound/hd-audio/models.html#alc22x-23x-25x-269-27x-28x-29x-and-vendor-specific-alc3xxx-models). (From the previous output: my card is a ALC295\\) As a **disclaimer**: I have not tried every single option in that list, only the ones which seemed sensible to me (so any which were describing a fix with the headphone jack). I wasn't sure how using a fix for a different sound card (e.g. alc283\\-sense\\-combo) would affect my system. So part of my question is, if I can safely use all of those options? Keep in mind, the ones I tried so far did not work.\n\nThe next answer asks if tlp is activated. I don't know what this is, but the file `/etc/default/tlp` they suggest to edit, does not exist, so I guess not.\n\nThis pretty much concludes the answers in this thread. Unfortunately I can't provide the links to some solutions because I cannot find them anymore.\n\nOne thing I saw somewhere was to disable some power options, in particular to add\n\n```\noptions snd-hda-intel power_save=0\n\n```\n\nto `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`, which also didn't help for me.\n\nI saw somewhere that people are experiencing this problem with newer kernel versions. Unfortunately I am a total Ubuntu beginner (as you might have guessed already) so I have no idea about kernels. Since this is a new install of Kubuntu 20\\.04 I am not even sure if I can switch to an older kernel, let alone how to. But if you think it's worth a try, let me know!\n\nA lot of answers also try to fix the problem using `pulseaudio`. Running the command `pulseaudio` in the terminal yields:\n\n```\nE: [pulseaudio] pid.c: Daemon already running.\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: pa_pid_file_create() failed.\n\n```\n\nAs I understood this is due to `pulseaudio` running already, but running `pulseaudio -k ; pulseaudio --start` does nothing\n\nRight now these are all the things I can think of.

It is a convention which is part of the text, just like a period or question mark.\n\nWe wouldn't leave out the question mark from \"Are you sure you wish to exit?\" and then write code to add the question attributes in a language\\-dependent manner to the translated string. Doing so means that the UI code is unnecessarily taking on the responsibilities of knowing how to punctuate sentences in various languages: a responsibility which can be handled in the message substitution.\n\nThere is an intermediate possibility. It is likely that, just like all labels have the colon feature in English, in other languages labels also have some lexical element in common. That element, if present, is probably some kind of prefix or suffix, or both.\n\nYou could represent the labels without the adornment, and then have an additional translatable string which provides a schema for adding the label adornment. As an example, suppose that C `sprintf` style formatting is available in the UI application. The English version of the label\\-generating format string would be `\"%s:\"`, and that could be the default as well, since it works in some other languages. The UI translators can replace this `\"%s:\"` with whatever they see fit. One of the possibilities is that they can replace it with just `\"%s\"` (do nothing) and then specify the full, adorned representation of each label in the translated string table. So this approach even handles some strange possibilities where the lexical marker which denotes a label has to be inserted into the middle.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem worthwhile, if all it achieves is a slight compression in the representation of label strings: the removal of one colon character. If you have to write 100 characters of extra code for this, you have to remove colons from 100 labels just to break even: and that doesn't even take into consideration justifying the time spent.\n\nThere has to be some payoff for this: namely that the application uses the strings for purposes other than just generating labels, such as generating sentences which refer to the UI fields by name. Say that a dialog box has a \"User ID:\" label for entering text. If you have generic logic which produces the message \"You have entered an invalid user ID.\" by combining a sentence boilerplate text with the name of a UI element, then it's necessary to have the unadorned string \"user ID\", and pass it through a label\\-making function to generate \"User ID:\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a multi-language UI for their application using a gettext-like framework.

Is it possible to specify exactly what the difference is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tikhonov regularizarization is a larger set than ridge regression. Here is my attempt to spell out exactly how they differ. \n\nSuppose that for a known matrix $A$ and vector $b$, we wish to find a vector $\\\\mathbf{x}$ such that \n: \n\n$A\\\\mathbf{x}\\=\\\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nThe standard approach is ordinary least squares linear regression. However, if no $x$ satisfies the equation or more than one $x$ does\u2014that is the solution is not unique\u2014the problem is said to be ill\\-posed. Ordinary least squares seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which can be compactly written as:\n\n$\\\\\\|A\\\\mathbf{x}\\-\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\\\|^2 $\n\nwhere $\\\\left \\\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right \\\\\\|$ is the Euclidean norm. In matrix notation the solution, denoted by $\\\\hat{x}$, is given by:\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A)^{\\-1}A^{T}\\\\mathbf{b}$\n\n**Tikhonov regularization** minimizes \n\n$\\\\\\|A\\\\mathbf{x}\\-\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\\\|^2\\+ \\\\\\|\\\\Gamma \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\\\|^2$\n\nfor some suitably chosen Tikhonov matrix, $\\\\Gamma $. An explicit matrix form solution, denoted by $\\\\hat{x}$, is given by:\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A\\+ \\\\Gamma^{T} \\\\Gamma )^{\\-1}A^{T}{b}$\n\nThe effect of regularization may be varied via the scale of matrix $\\\\Gamma$. For $\\\\Gamma \\= 0$ this reduces to the unregularized least squares solution provided that (ATA)\u22121 exists.\n\nTypically for **ridge regression**, two departures from Tikhonov regularization are described. First, the Tikhonov matrix is replaced by a multiple of the identity matrix \n\n$\\\\Gamma\\= \\\\alpha I $, \n\ngiving preference to solutions with smaller norm, i.e., the $L\\_2$ norm. Then $\\\\Gamma^{T} \\\\Gamma$ becomes $\\\\alpha^2 I$ leading to\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A\\+ \\\\alpha^2 I )^{\\-1}A^{T}{b}$\n\nFinally, for ridge regression, it is typically assumed that $A$ variables are scaled so that $X^{T}X$ has the form of a correlation matrix. and $X^{T}b$ is the correlation vector between the $x$ variables and $b$, leading to\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (X^{T}X\\+ \\\\alpha^2 I )^{\\-1}X^{T}{b}$\n\nNote in this form the Lagrange multiplier $\\\\alpha^2$ is usually replaced by $k$, $\\\\lambda$, or some other symbol but retains the property $\\\\lambda\\\\geq0$\n\nIn formulating this answer, I acknowledge borrowing liberally from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) and from [Ridge estimation of transfer function weights](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610919008812867)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following statements about Tikhonov regularization and ridge regression:\n\nI.

In fact, there are **local** obstructions to the existence of the desired surface. Let $\\\\gamma:(\\-\\\\epsilon,\\\\epsilon) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ be an embedded arc parameterized proportional to arc length and let $S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ be a smooth surface containing $\\\\gamma$. Then $\\\\gamma$ is a geodesic on $S$ if and only if $\\\\gamma''(t)$ is orthogonal to the tangent plane of $S$ for all $t$. The tangent planes of $S$ thus give a smoothly varying family of planes in the restriction to $\\\\gamma$ of the tangent bundle of $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ which are orthogonal to $\\\\gamma''$. Such a family of planes need not exist. The problem arises at points where $\\\\gamma''(t)\\=0$; it is clear what the tangent plane to $S$ must be elsewhere.\n\nFor example, let $\\\\gamma\\_1:(\\-\\\\epsilon,\\\\epsilon)\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ be a smooth embedded curve with the following properties.\n\n1. For all $t$, we have $\\\\\\|\\\\gamma\\_1'(t)\\\\\\| \\= 1$. In particular, $\\\\gamma\\_1$ is parameterized proportional to arc length.\n2. For $\\-\\\\epsilon\\<t\\\\leq 0$, we have $\\\\gamma\\_1(t) \\= (0,0,t)$.\n3. For $0\\<t\\<\\\\epsilon$, we have $\\\\gamma\\_1''(t) \\\\neq 0$ and $\\\\gamma\\_1(t) \\\\in \\\\{(x,y,z)\\\\text{ $\\|$ }z \\> 0\\\\}$.\n\nSuch curves are easy to construct. Now, of course, we might have already found a problematic curve, but let's assume that we haven't, so there exists a surface $S\\_1$ in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ containing $\\\\gamma\\_1$ such that $\\\\gamma\\_1$ is a geodesic in $S\\_1$. For $0\\<t\\<\\\\epsilon$, let $n\\_1(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\)$ be the line in the direction $\\\\gamma\\_1''(t)$. We know that the tangent plane to $S\\_1$ at $\\\\gamma\\_1(t)$ is the orthogonal complement of $n\\_1(t)$. This implies that $v\\_1:\\=\\\\lim\\_{t \\\\mapsto 0^\\+} n\\_1(t)$ exists: it is the orthogonal complement to the tangent plane to $S\\_1$ at $(0,0,0\\)$. The key point here is that the tangent plane to $S\\_1$ at $(0,0,0\\)$ is uniquely determined by $\\\\gamma\\_1$. It is clear that $v\\_1 \\\\neq \\[0,0,1]$.\n\nLet $M:\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ be the orthogonal linear map obtained by composing the reflection in the $z$\\-axis with a small rotation in the $xy$\\-plane.\nDefine $\\\\gamma\\_2:(\\-\\\\epsilon,\\\\epsilon) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ via the formula\n$$\\\\gamma\\_2(t) \\= M(\\\\gamma\\_1(\\-t)).$$\nThe following then hold.\n\n1. For all $t$, we have $\\\\\\|\\\\gamma\\_2'(t)\\\\\\| \\= 1$. In particular, $\\\\gamma\\_2$ is parameterized proportional to arc length.\n2. For $0 \\\\leq t \\< \\\\epsilon$, we have $\\\\gamma\\_2(t) \\= (0,0,t)$.\n3. For $\\-\\\\epsilon\\<t\\<0$, we have $\\\\gamma\\_2''(t) \\\\neq 0$ and $\\\\gamma\\_2(t) \\\\in \\\\{(x,y,z)\\\\text{ $\\|$ }z \\< 0\\\\}$.\n4. For $\\-\\\\epsilon\\<t\\<0$, define $n\\_2(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\)$ to be the line in the direction\n$\\\\gamma\\_2''(t)$. Then $v\\_2:\\=\\\\lim\\_{t \\\\mapsto 0^\\-}n\\_2(t)$ exists and is different from $v\\_1$ (this is the point\nof the rotation in the $xy$\\-plane in the definition of $M$).\n\nNow define $\\\\gamma:(\\-\\\\epsilon,\\\\epsilon) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ via the formula\n$$\\\\gamma(t) \\= \\\\begin{cases}\n\\\\gamma\\_2(t) \\& \\\\text{if $\\-\\\\epsilon\\<t\\\\leq 0$},\\\\\\\\\n\\\\gamma\\_1(t) \\& \\\\text{if $0\\<t\\<\\\\epsilon$}. \\\\end{cases}$$\nThe second condition on $\\\\gamma\\_1$ and $\\\\gamma\\_2$ implies that $\\\\gamma$ is a smooth curve. For $\\-\\\\epsilon\\<t\\<\\\\epsilon$\nsatisfying $t \\\\neq 0$, we have $\\\\gamma''(t) \\\\neq 0$; define $n(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\)$ to be the line\nin the direction of $\\\\gamma''(t)$. We then have\n$$\\\\lim\\_{t \\\\mapsto 0^\\+} n(t) \\= v\\_1$$\nand\n$$\\\\lim\\_{t \\\\mapsto 0^\\-} n(t) \\= v\\_2\\.$$\nThese are different, so $\\\\lim\\_{t \\\\mapsto 0} n(t)$ does not exist. This implies that $\\\\gamma$ cannot possibly\nbe a geodesic in any surface.\n\nOf course, $\\\\gamma$ is not a closed curve, but it is easy to close it up to a simple closed unknotted curve.\n\n---\n\nIn this edit, I'll comment on further obstructions. Let's assume that the desired family of planes on $\\\\gamma$ exists. Using a tubular neighborhood, it is easy to find a small \"strip\" around $\\\\gamma$ on which $\\\\gamma$ is a geodesic. As David points out, this strip might be a Mobius band, which is bad, so let's assume that it is an annulus $A$ with boundary components $\\\\alpha\\_1$ and $\\\\alpha\\_2$. There is now a new obstruction: the linking number of $\\\\alpha\\_1$ with $\\\\gamma$ might be nonzero (nb: it is an easy exercise to see that the linking numbers of $\\\\alpha\\_1$ and $\\\\alpha\\_2$ with $\\\\gamma$ must be the same, though since these loops are unoriented these linking numbers are only well\\-defined up to signs). This is a problem because we want $\\\\alpha\\_1$ to bound a disc in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus \\\\gamma$, which since $\\\\gamma$ is an unknot is homeomorphic to the result of removing a point from an open disc cross $S^1$; in particular, $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus \\\\gamma) \\= \\\\mathbb{Z}$. The linking number of $\\\\alpha\\_1$ with $\\\\gamma$ is the image of $\\\\alpha\\_1$ in $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus \\\\gamma)$. So we have to assume that this linking number is $0$. Letting $U$ be a closed tubular neighborhood of $\\\\gamma$ containing $A$ with $\\\\partial A \\\\subset \\\\partial U$, we have $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus \\\\gamma) \\= \\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus U)$. We deduce that $\\\\alpha\\_1$ is nullhomotopic in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus U$. Applying Dehn's Lemma (which is overkill in this situation, but why not?), we see that $\\\\alpha\\_1$ bounds a disc $D\\_1$ in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus U$. We now want $\\\\alpha\\_2$ to bound a disc in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus (A \\\\cup D\\_1\\)$, but this is easy since $A \\\\cup D\\_1$ is homeomorphic to a closed disc, so $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus (A \\\\cup D\\_1\\)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus \\\\{x\\_0\\\\}$ for a point $x\\_0 \\\\in A \\\\cup D\\_1$; in particular, $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\setminus (A \\\\cup D\\_1\\)) \\= 0$.\n\n---\n\nI want to close with one further remark about the above. Assuming it exists, the family of planes that was the input to the above construction is unique exactly when the set of points on $\\\\gamma$ where $\\\\gamma'' \\\\neq 0$ is dense. But if there exists an interval on which $\\\\gamma''\\=0$, then we can use that interval to introduce as many half twists as we need to the planes to get rid of the Mobius band and linking number obstructions.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY OF ANSWER** Let me summarize the answer, which gives a\nset of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the\nsphere (whose logic is, alas, a little complicated). First, there is a\n\"local\" obstruction that must be satisfied for the desired sphere to exist. It\ncan be defined as follows. Let $U \\\\subset \\\\gamma$ be the set of all\npoints where $\\\\gamma''$ is nonzero. Define\n$\\\\phi:U \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\)$ to take $u \\\\in U$ to the\nline in the direction of $\\\\gamma''(t)$. Then for a sphere to exist,\nthe function $\\\\phi$ must be able to be extended to a function\n$\\\\widehat{\\\\phi}:\\\\gamma \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\)$ such\nthat $\\\\widehat{\\\\phi}(x)$ is orthogonal to $\\\\gamma'(x)$ for all $x$. This\nis a vacuous condition if $\\\\gamma''$ never vanishes.\n\nNow assume that such a $\\\\widehat{\\\\phi}$ exists. If $U$ is not dense\nin $\\\\gamma$, then no further conditions are needed: the sphere exists.\n\nOtherwise, two further conditions are needed. Observe that in\nthis case, by the way, the extension $\\\\widehat{\\\\phi}$ is unique. The\nfirst is that there exits a continuous function\n$\\\\widehat{\\\\psi}:\\\\gamma \\\\rightarrow S^2$ such that\n$\\\\widehat{\\\\phi}(x)$ is the line in the direction $\\\\widehat{\\\\psi}(x)$\nfor all $x \\\\in \\\\gamma$. This condition is vacuously satisfied if\n$\\\\gamma''$ never vanishes (just take $\\\\widehat{\\\\psi}(x)$ to be the\nunit vector in the direction of $\\\\gamma''(x)$). The purpose of\nthis condition is to ensure that the \"strip\" defined in the answer is\nnot a Mobius band. If this condition holds,\nthen we can define the \"winding number\" of $\\\\widehat{\\\\psi}$ around\n$\\\\gamma$ since $\\\\widehat{\\\\psi}(x)$ lies in the orthogonal complement\nof $\\\\gamma'(x)$, which is a great circle in $S^2$. The second\nneeded condition is that this winding number vanishes."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a smooth, closed, unknotted curve \u03b3 embedded in \u211d\u00b3. Which of the following statements is NOT a necessary condition for the existence of a smooth, embedded, genus-zero surface S in \u211d\u00b3 such that \u03b3 is a closed geodesic on S?\n\nA) The function \u03c6:U \u2192 P(\u211d\u00b3) that maps points where \u03b3'' \u2260 0 to the line in the direction of \u03b3'' must be extendable to \u03b3.\n\nB) If the set of points where \u03b3'' \u2260 0 is dense in \u03b3, there must exist a continuous function \u03c8\u0302:\u03b3 \u2192 S\u00b2 such that \u03c6\u0302(x) is the line in the direction \u03c8\u0302(x) for all x \u2208 \u03b3.\n\nC) The winding number of \u03c8\u0302 around \u03b3 must be zero, if \u03c8\u0302 exists.\n\nD) The curve \u03b3 must have non-zero curvature at every point.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and C are all necessary conditions described in the summary of the answer. Option A relates to the local obstruction, where \u03c6 must be extendable to \u03b3. Option B ensures that the \"strip\" around \u03b3 is not a M\u00f6bius band. Option C is the final condition about the winding number.\n\nOption D, however, is not a necessary condition. The documentation states that if there exists an interval on which \u03b3'' = 0 (i.e., zero curvature), it can actually be used to introduce half twists to eliminate some obstructions. Therefore, having non-zero curvature at every point is not required, making this the incorrect statement."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/262717", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/136707/"], "docs_id": 262717, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I really need your help.

I think it's been solved now, all thanks to hours of googling, testing and stubbornness.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, I've fixed the read only filesystem problem by upgrading my Kernel to 3\\.8\\.2 but then it caused problems with my wifi drivers (Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802\\.11b/g LP\\-PHY \\[14e4:4315] (rev 01\\)). I could not get the wifi working as it seemed to be the problem with the wl module.\n\nNevertheless, I've found this article ([http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless\\-bcm4312\\-with\\-the\\-3\\-4\\-and\\-3\\-5\\-kernel/](http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless-bcm4312-with-the-3-4-and-3-5-kernel/)), which helped me fix the wifi problem. So I've decided to give kernel 3\\.8\\.2 one more try with the wifi fix and it worked.\n\nTo summarise:\nIf you have read only filesystem issues and nothing is working, check what version of kernel you are running `uname -a`.
