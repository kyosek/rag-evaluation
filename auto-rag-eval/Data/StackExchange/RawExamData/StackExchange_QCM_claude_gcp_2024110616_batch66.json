The modded Dupont cable does not work for my case. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/982So.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/982So.jpg)\n\n**Environment**: breadboard, the Espressif ESP32 MCU as I2C Master using pin \\#21 as SCL and pin \\#17 as SDA (the internal \"weak\" \\+\\-4\\.7K pullups are enabled), a Melexis MLX90393 magnetic field sensor as I2C Slave on a Sparkfun breakout board (product <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14571>; the 10K pullups on the Sparkfun breakout board are also enabled). See picture for the breadboard setup (focus on the pullup resistor).\n\n**The software works fine** and I get 5 sensor readings per second if I wire **a bare\\-bone 10K pullup resistor** between the hole next to the MCU's SCL pin \\#21, and a hole on the 3\\.3V rail of the breadboard. This is standard procedure for I2C schemes in order to pull the I2C SCL high by default. Same for SDA.\n\nHowever, I wanted to make wiring up things on the breadboard much easier and use **a modded Dupont cable for the pullup**. So I took a 30 centimeter Dupont wire, cut it in the middle, and soldered a standard 10K pullup resistor in between and put a shrink tube around it. If I measure the impedance between the 2 ends of the cable then it is \\+\\-10K Ohm.\n\nSo I plugged the modded Dupont cable besides the MCU's SCL pin \\#21 and the 3\\.3V rail of the breadboard (replacing the bare\\-bone resistor's of the previous configuration). Now **the system does not work anymore\\*** (the I2C communication fails). \n\nWhat could be the (electrical?) reason for the failure?

The system works correctly with a standard through-hole 10K pullup resistor, but fails when using a modified Dupont cable with a 10K resistor soldered in the middle. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this behavior?\n\nA) The modified Dupont cable introduces excessive capacitance, causing signal integrity issues at high frequencies\nB) The soldered connection in the modified cable creates an unintended voltage divider effect\nC) Poor contact between the modified Dupont cable headers and the breadboard increases overall resistance\nD) The longer path of the modified cable violates the maximum allowed wire length for I2C communication\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple factors in I2C communication and real-world application of electronics principles. The correct answer is A because the modified Dupont cable, being significantly longer than a standard through-hole resistor, likely introduces parasitic capacitance to the I2C lines. This added capacitance can cause signal integrity issues, especially at higher frequencies, leading to communication failures.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a properly soldered resistor wouldn't create a voltage divider. Option C, while plausible, is less likely to be the primary cause as the resistance measurement was confirmed to be correct. Option D is a distractor, as typical I2C implementations can tolerate much longer wire lengths than what's described here.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of signal integrity in digital communications, the impact of parasitic elements in circuits, and the critical thinking needed to troubleshoot real-world electronic issues beyond simple component replacement."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/172654", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/77171/"], "docs_id": 172654, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am wondering whether I can use \"be about to\" and \"soon\" or \"immediately\" in one sentence?\nI found online that the following two sentences \"The\u00a0medical\u00a0team\u00a0is\u00a0about\u00a0to\u00a0start\u00a0immediately\" and \"He is about to leave soon\" are wrong. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Immediately means right now, this instant.\n\n> I am buying that Commemorative His Highness King FAISAL watch immediately!

The correct answer is C because it accurately conveys the urgency of the situation without creating a logical contradiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"about to\" and \"immediately\" create a temporal conflict. \"About to\" suggests an action that will happen very soon but not instantly, while \"immediately\" means right now. This combination is contradictory and one of the examples explicitly stated as incorrect in the documentation.\n\nOption B is incorrect for similar reasons. While \"about to\" and \"soon\" can sometimes be used together, in this urgent context, it doesn't convey the immediate action required by firefighters in a rapidly spreading fire.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't convey the urgency required in the scenario. \"Are\" with \"soon\" suggests a less immediate action, which doesn't fit the context of a rapidly spreading fire.\n\nOption C, \"will immediately,\" correctly combines the future tense with the urgency of \"immediately.\" This phrase indicates that the action will happen right away, which is appropriate for the firefighters' response to a rapidly spreading fire.\n\nThis question requires the learner to analyze the context, apply their understanding of these time-related phrases, and choose the most appropriate combination that maintains grammatical correctness while conveying the intended urgency of the situation."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/11/22", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46970", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/5627/"], "docs_id": 46970, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently, I learnt in my analysis class the proof of the uncountability of the reals via the [Nested Interval Theorem](http://personal.bgsu.edu/%7Ecarother/cantor/Nested.html) ([Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20180402194030/http://personal.bgsu.edu/%7Ecarother/cantor/Nested.html)). At first, I was excited to see a variant proof (as it did not use the diagonal argument explicitly). However, as time passed, I began to see that the proof was just the old one veiled under new terminology. So, till now I believe that any proof of the uncountability of the reals must use Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nIs my belief justified?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mathematics isn't yet ready to prove results of the form, \"Every proof of Theorem T *must use* Argument A.\" Think closely about how you might try to prove something like that. You would need to set up some *plausible system for mathematics* in which Cantor's diagonal argument is blocked and *the reals are countable*. Nobody has any idea how to do that.\n\nThe best you can hope for is to look at each proof on a case\\-by\\-case basis and decide, subjectively, whether it is \"essentially the diagonal argument in disguise.\" If you're lucky, you'll run into one that your intuition tells you is a fundamentally different proof, and that will settle the question to your satisfaction. But if that doesn't happen, then the most you'll be able to say is that every *known* proof seems *to you* to be the same. As explained above, you won't be able to conclude definitively that every possible argument *must* use diagonalization.\n\n**ADDENDUM** (August 2020\\). Normann and Sanders have a [very interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07560) that sheds new light on the uncountability of $\\\\mathbb R$. In particular they study two specific formulations of the uncountability of $\\\\mathbb R$:\n\n$\\\\mathsf{NIN}$: For any $Y:\\[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$, there exist $x,y \\\\in \\[0,1]$ such that $x\\\\ne\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} y$ and $Y(x) \\=\\_{\\\\mathbb{N}} Y(y)$.\n\n$\\\\mathsf{NBI}$: For any $Y\\[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$, either there exist $x,y \\\\in \\[0,1]$ such that $x\\\\ne\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} y$ and $Y(x) \\=\\_{\\\\mathbb{N}} Y(y)$, or there exists $N\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$ such that $(\\\\forall x\\\\in \\[0,1])(Y(x) \\\\ne N)$.\n\nOne of their results is that a system called ${\\\\mathsf Z}\\_2^\\\\omega$ does not prove $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$. Their model of $\\\\neg\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ can therefore be interpreted as a situation where the reals are countable! Nevertheless we are still far from showing that Cantor's diagonal argument is needed to prove that the reals are uncountable. A further caveat is that Normann and Sanders argue that the unprovability of $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ in ${\\\\mathsf Z}\\_2^\\\\omega$\u2014which might at first sight suggest that $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ is a strong axiom\u2014is an artificial result, and that the proper framework for studying $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$ is what they call a \u201cnon\\-normal scale,\u201d in which $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$ are very weak. In particular their paper gives lots of examples of statements that imply $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$. I suspect, though, that you'll probably feel that the proofs of those other statements smuggle in Cantor's diagonal argument one way or another.\n\n**ADDENDUM** (December 2022\\).\nI just listened to an [amazing talk by Andrej Bauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CBFUojXoq4), reporting on joint work with James Hanson.\nIf you start listening around [14:53](https://youtu.be/4CBFUojXoq4?t=893), you'll see how, in the context of intuitionistic logic, one can formulate precisely the question of whether there is a proof of the uncountability of the reals that doesn't use diagonalization. Bauer and Hanson don't answer this question, but they construct something they call a \"parameterized realizability topos\" in which *the Dedekind reals are countable*. In particular, this shows that higher\\-order intuitionistic logic (in which one cannot formulate the usual diagonalization argument) cannot show the reals are uncountable. Now, you could still justifiably claim that this whole line of research does not really address the original question, which I presume tacitly assumes classical logic; nevertheless, this still comes closer than anything else I've seen."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is developing a new proof for the uncountability of the real numbers.

He was discussing the very peculiar phenomena of dropping an oversized slinky and watching as the bottom of the slinky remains suspended in mid air. Tyson goes onto explain that the bottom of the slinky simply does not know to fall until the arrival of the top which carries information of the gravitational force \\- it is essentially oblivious to the gravity exerted on it (I may be butchering his more eloquent explanation a bit).\n\nI have more recently heard a somewhat simpler (and for easier to accept) explanation regarding the fact that the spring is constantly applying an elastic force on the bottom of the spring to keep it suspended. I suppose this would even delay the decent of rigid objects to a very subtle degree since there is always some elasticity?\n\nSeeing as the former explanation is some what more grand and makes for a better story, I would like to confirm which of these holds more weight.\n\nI have already done a bit of searching on this site and understand that gravity is limited by the speed of light, but I do not believe that this is necessarily applicable here, so as far as I know this question has not been tackled here as of yet.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably confused what he was saying a bit. The information that the bottom of the slinky is waiting for is the information that the top of the slinky is no longer supported. This travels down the slinky as the higher bits fall down and no longer exert a force (tension) supporting the lower bits.\n\nIncidentally in other circumstances the speed of gravity (which travels at the same speed as light) is significant. The standard example is if someone stole the sun it would take 8 minutes for that information to get to us. The light from the sun and the sudden lack of it's gravity would both take about 8 minutes to get here. In the intervening 8 minutes we would continue to orbit the place the sun used to be as normal."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about the slinky phenomenon:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is demonstrating the peculiar behavior of a suspended slinky being dropped. Which of the following best explains why the bottom of the slinky appears to remain stationary for a brief moment before falling?\n\nA) The bottom of the slinky is unaffected by gravity until the information about the top's release reaches it at the speed of light\nB) The elastic force of the spring exactly counteracts gravity on the bottom coil until the top descends\nC) The bottom of the slinky experiences quantum levitation due to its unique metallic properties\nD) Air resistance on the coils creates a temporary upward force equal to gravity on the bottom\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct explanation combines elements of both perspectives mentioned in the documentation. The bottom of the slinky appears to remain stationary because the elastic force of the spring is initially counteracting the gravitational force on the bottom coil. This elastic force is maintained by the tension in the spring, which is gradually released as the top of the slinky begins to fall.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it references the idea of information travel mentioned by Neil deGrasse Tyson, it misinterprets the concept. The \"information\" in this case is not traveling at the speed of light, but rather at the speed of the mechanical wave through the spring.\n\nOption C is a distractor that introduces an unrelated and incorrect concept (quantum levitation), which might appeal to those who misunderstand quantum phenomena.\n\nOption D presents a plausible-sounding but incorrect explanation involving air resistance, which could be tempting for those who don't fully grasp the forces at play.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (elastic forces, gravity, and wave propagation in materials) and tests the ability to analyze a real-world scenario beyond simple memorization of facts. It also challenges common misconceptions about the phenomenon, particularly the idea that gravity somehow doesn't affect the bottom of the slinky until later."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/30", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/120335", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/30983/"], "docs_id": 120335, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose we are given the Fourier coefficients of an $L^2$ function on the circle.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As explained in the top answer, when x is already bound in \u03c6, the universal quantifier \u2200x in \u2200x \u03c6 doesn't actually quantify over any free variables. This means that for any model M, M \u22a8 \u03c6 if and only if M \u22a8 \u2200x \u03c6.\n\n2. The logical equivalence arises because replacing all free occurrences of x in \u03c6 (of which there are none) doesn't change the truth value of the formula in any model.\n\n3. While A might seem plausible, it's incorrect because \u2200x \u03c6 is not stronger when x is already bound; they are equivalent.\n\n4. C is a common misconception. The formula \u2200x \u03c6 is well-formed, even if x is bound in \u03c6; it's just that the quantifier doesn't affect the meaning.\n\n5.

B captures the subtle distinction that while \u03c6 and \u2200x \u03c6 are logically equivalent (have the same models), \u2200x \u03c6 provides additional syntactic information about the formula's structure, even if it doesn't change its semantic meaning.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of quantifier behavior, logical equivalence, and the relationship between syntax and semantics in formal logic, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/10/18", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/355512", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/870240/"], "docs_id": 355512, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In rare cases I want to search something on the Internet and I am pretty sure that the answer is there, but I am not able to formulate my search to get there (although I am an experienced searcher).\n\nMy last choice may be creating a new question where an experienced user tells me that this topic is treated in another question, with a question title that I would have never come across with.

Regardless of the temp in my home, the blower motor runs non\\-stop.\nIn the winter this must have been causing my home to got through a permanent heat/cool cycle as the blower would bring cool air in after the home was at the right temp. Then the temp would get low, the furnace would kick in to heat the home and on and on.\n\nIn the summer now it seems to be doing the same thing but with the A/C. Once the home is cool enough, the blower keeps bringing in outside air with the A/C off now. This causes the home to heat up and on and on.

When the high limit switch trips, the flame/heating element will be shut off and the blower will continue to run to clear the heat. The blower will continue to run until either the system is reset, or the limit switch closes.\n\nI believe high limit switches are normally closed, and they should always fail open. Which means when they go bad, or the temperature gets too high they open the circuit. To test a limit switch, you'll want to check continuity to determine what state the switch is in.\n\n* If there is a serviceman switch, turn it off. If not, shut the power off at the breaker panel.\n* Open the access panel and locate the high limit switch. It should be somewhere on the hot box.\n* Disconnect the wires from the switch (don't forget which goes where).\n* Using a multimeter, test for continuity between the leads on the switch.\n\n*There is an easier test to check limit switches, but it should only be performed by HVAC techs. So I will not discuss it here.*\n\nIf the circuit is open, you'll want to replace the limit switch.\n\nIf the limit switch is adjustable, make sure it is set properly according to the manufactures specifications.\n\nIf the limit switch tests OK; or you've replaced it and still have the issue, you'll want to focus on the thermostat.\n\nFrom your description, it sounds more like a problem with the thermostat. Most safety mechanisms in furnaces do not let the furnace fire if there's a fault, so if you're getting flame I would not suspect a limit switch. I would suspect either the thermostat has gone bad, or it is miswired. If the fan is always on I would suspect either the fan switch has failed closed (is always in the ON position), or the fan wire was incorrectly bonded to the voltage feed line. \n\nThermostats are basically switch boxes. They'll have one live wire \\[`R`] (usually 24v in the US, or line voltage in other parts of the world), one heat call wire \\[`W`], one blower fan call wire \\[`G`], and optionally a cool call \\[`Y`], and/or [`C` wire](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/10527/33). When the thermostat wants to warm up, it will connect the `R` to `W` and `G` which tells the furnace the thermostat is cold and needs heat. If it's hot it connects the `R` to `Y` and `G`, to tell the furnace it's hot and wants to be cooled down. If you have a `FAN` control and you turn it to `ON`, the thermostat connects `R` to `G` and the blower fan turns on.\n\nThe easiest way to rule out the thermostat, is to replace it. Troubleshooting thermostats is a pain in the ass, so it's much easier to simply switch it out.\n\nIf you've changed the thermostat and you're still having the problem, call an HVAC tech."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner notices their HVAC system's blower motor running continuously, regardless of the temperature setting.

By using column specifiers like >{$}l<{$} and >{\\footnotesize}l, we can ensure that the mathematical symbols are properly rendered and that the text size is appropriate for annotations.\n\nThis solution integrates multiple LaTeX concepts (environments, matrices, and tables) and requires an understanding of how these elements interact within the document structure. It also addresses the real-world application of presenting mathematical content in a clear and organized manner, which is crucial in academic and scientific documentation.\n\nOptions A, C, and D, while potentially workable, are either more complex (creating a custom environment or using tikz) or less elegant (using separate environments) than the nested flalign and tabular solution. The chosen approach demonstrates a deeper understanding of LaTeX's capabilities and how to efficiently combine them to solve layout challenges."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/283893", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/61302/"], "docs_id": 283893, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am working on a colleague to refactor the following code, I am trying to turn this into a teaching experience as well. \n\n**Original Code** \n\n```\npublic class WidgetRepository\n{\n    public Widget GetWidget(int id)\n    {\n        Widget widget;\n\n        if (HttpContext.Current != null)\n        {\n            widget = (Widget)HttpContext.Current.Cache[\"widget_\" + id];\n        }\n\n        if (widget == null)\n        {\n            widget = GetWidgetImpl(id); // some db call\n\n            if (HttpContext.Current != null)\n            {\n                HttpContext.Current.Cache[\"widget_\" + id] = widget;\n            }\n        }           \n\n        return widget;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe most obvious thing that sticks out is that you have your repository knowing about ASP.NET concepts, which is particularly bad as this repository is used by non\\-ASP.NET code in some scenarios. \n\n**Refactored Code**\n\nI decided to refactor the code as follows:\n\n```\npublic class WidgetRepository\n{\n    private readonly ICacheProvider _cacheProvider;\n\n    public WidgetRepository(ICacheProvider cacheProvider)\n    {\n        _cacheProvider = cacheProvider;\n    }\n\n    public Widget GetWidget(int id)\n    {       \n        var widget = _cacheProvider.Get<Widget>(\"widget_\" + id);\n\n        if (widget == null)\n        {\n            widget = GetWidgetImpl(id); // some db call\n\n            _cacheProvider.Add(\"widget_\" + id, widget);\n        }\n\n        return widget;\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface ICacheProvider \n{\n    T Get<T>(string key);\n    void Add<T>(string key, T item);\n}\n\npublic HttpCacheProvider : ICacheProvider\n{\n    private readonly Cache _cache;\n\n    public HttpCacheProvider(Cache cache)\n    {\n        _cache = cache;\n    }\n\n    public T Get<T>(string key)\n    {\n        return (T)_cache[key];\n    }\n\n    public void Add<T>(string key, T item)\n    {\n        _cache[key] = item;\n    }       \n}\n\npublic NullCacheProvider : ICacheProvider\n{\n    public T Get<T>(string key)\n    {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    public void Add<T>(string key, T item)\n    {\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n**My Justification**\n\nI explained the following benefits to the refactored code: \n\n1. Promotes Open / Close: we can change the caching implementation if we want to use something else in the future (memcached, etc.)\n2. Lower cyclomatic complexity: less if statements\n3. Not mixing ASP.NET technology with data\\-access technology\n\n**Refutations / Concerns**\n\nHowever, I got the following refutations:\n\n1. We're not going to use a different caching technology in the foreseeable future.\n2. It's more lines of code (therefore it's more complex)\n3. You need to setup the dependencies (complexity is moved, not removed)\n4. There's already tonnes of code that uses `HttpContext.Current`, so this code does not follow the existing (anti\\-)pattern\n5. We're still \"using\" ASP.NET within data\\-access code.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nPersonally, I find that the pros outweigh the refutations, however, I would like to be able to address the refutations in order to help educate them.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Am I justified in making the refactoring (assuming we have time allocated for cleaning up code)?\n2. How do I respond to the various refutations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Am I justified in making the refactoring (assuming we have time allocated for cleaning up code)?\n\nAre you doing anything else in this code?\n\nIf not, this seems not worth the effort. Your peer is likely right that you aren't ever going to use other things \\- and that you should keep things consistent.\n\nIf you are, then cleaning this stuff up too seems like a clear benefit for minimal effort/risk (though you might need to add a default constructor that uses the `HttpContext` to make it minimal impact).\n\n> How do I respond to the various refutations?\n\n1. Yes, but that's no reason to couple something unnecessarily when it's so easy to do things better.\n2. More code is not necessarily more complex. In this case, it *is* more complex, but trivially so. And in exchange, it makes unit testing much easier and the code more flexible.\n3. Sure, it's just shifting the problem around, but it's shifting the problem to a more decoupled form. It lets you deal with parts of the problem in isolation rather than having a larger more unweildy problem.\n4. \"This is what we have always done\" is not an excuse to perpetuate bad code/design/anything. Yes, you should aim to keep code consistent, but in this case you should push for consistency with the decoupled pattern rather than the direct `HttpContext` access. Yes, that's more work \\- but it's the right thing to do. If your peer pushes that there's not time for all that now (and has an alternative that is better) then maybe agree to do it later (and add a ticket/bug/story to *actually* do it).\n5. See \\#4\\."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is refactoring a legacy codebase that heavily relies on HttpContext.Current for caching in data access layers. They want to improve the design while minimizing disruption to existing systems. Which approach best addresses the technical debt while considering practical constraints?\n\nA) Implement a facade pattern that wraps HttpContext.Current calls, gradually replacing direct usage across the codebase\nB) Create an ICacheProvider interface with HttpContext and null implementations, injecting it into repositories\nC) Replace all HttpContext.Current caching with a distributed caching solution like Redis\nD) Leave the existing code as-is and focus on implementing better patterns only in new features\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B (creating an ICacheProvider interface with HttpContext and null implementations) is the best approach in this scenario. This solution addresses several key aspects of the problem:\n\n1. Decoupling: It separates the caching concern from the data access logic, allowing the repository to remain agnostic of the specific caching implementation.\n\n2. Flexibility: The interface allows for easy swapping of caching implementations in the future, adhering to the Open/Closed principle.\n\n3. Testability: By using dependency injection and an interface, unit testing becomes much easier as the cache can be mocked or stubbed.\n\n4. Gradual adoption: This approach allows for incremental refactoring, as the HttpCacheProvider can initially wrap the existing HttpContext.Current logic, minimizing immediate disruption.\n\n5. Handling non-web scenarios: The NullCacheProvider addresses situations where the code is used outside of ASP.NET contexts.\n\nWhile option A (facade pattern) could be a step in the right direction, it doesn't fully address the coupling issue. Option C (distributed caching) is likely overkill and introduces unnecessary complexity given the current constraints. Option D (leaving as-is) misses the opportunity to improve the codebase and address technical debt.\n\nThis solution balances immediate practical concerns (like not completely overhauling existing systems) with sound software design principles, making it the most appropriate choice for refactoring in this context."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/12/05", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/486116", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/324355/"], "docs_id": 486116, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a tmux config with the line `bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf` where `~/.tmux.conf` is my current tmux config.  \n\nThis works fine and has a status bar that looks like:\n\n```\n [ cpStudy ] * 96%            ( 0:nvim *)                [  05-12 -  10:56  ] \n\n```\n\nHowever when i start a new tmux session(often with `tmux`) the config doesn't seem to load properly, and i get the following statusbar\n\n```\n[3]               ( 0:zsh *)                  \"cpj@cpStudy: ~\" 10:58 05-Dec-18\n\n```\n\nWhich seems to be a default statusbar, and not the one in the config.

This solution directly addresses the problem while maintaining data integrity and allowing for subsequent spatial analysis. Here's why:\n\n1. Reading with masked=False preserves the original nodata values (-9999.0) in the numpy array.\n2. Manually applying the mask allows for precise control over how nodata values are handled.\n3. This approach doesn't alter the original data or rasterio's behavior, making it a non-invasive solution.\n4.

Option B, while seemingly straightforward, introduces an unnecessary step and potential for data loss or inaccuracy if other legitimate NaN values exist.

A custom Python script can traverse the directory tree, check for the \"Data\" folder in the path, and selectively copy only the relevant files while maintaining the directory structure. This approach allows for precise control and can handle complex conditions that command-line tools might struggle with.\n\nC) While the documentation shows a SQL hierarchical query using CONNECT BY PRIOR, this is not directly applicable to file system operations. This option serves as a distractor that tests whether the candidate can differentiate between database query concepts and file system operations.\n\nD) The robocopy command with /mir option would mirror the entire directory structure, including files and folders that don't contain \"Data\" in their path. This is an inefficient solution that doesn't meet the specific requirements of the task.\n\nThe correct answer (B) requires the integration of multiple concepts: understanding the limitations of simple command-line tools, recognizing the need for a more sophisticated approach, and applying programming knowledge to solve a real-world file system problem.

They're also widely used in numerical applications. But I've just tested the examples above for small $\\\\epsilon$ using SciPy and got incorrect results.\n\nSo my question is, how do numerical analysts get around this problem? Or why is this apparently not a problem?\n\nI could venture some guesses: While finding eigenvectors of general matrices may be impossible, it *is* possible to find their eigenvalues. Also, it's possible to \"shift\" a problematic matrix by some small $\\\\epsilon$ so that its eigendecomposition is computable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The singular value decomposition, when applied to a real symmetric matrix $A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\lambda\\_i(A) u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$, computes a stable mathematical object (spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\lambda\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$, which is a [projection\\-valued measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-valued_measure)) using a partially unstable coordinate system (the eigenvalues $\\\\lambda\\_i(A)$ and eigenvectors $u\\_i(A)$; the eigenvalues are stable, but the eigenvectors are not). The numerical instability of the latter reflects the [coordinate singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_singularity) of this coordinate system, but does not contradict the stability of the former. But in numerical computations we have to use the latter rather than the former, because standard computer languages have built\\-in data representations for numbers and vectors, but usually do not have built\\-in data representations for projection\\-valued measures.\n\nAn analogy is with floating\\-point arithmetic. The operation of multiplication of two floating point numbers (expressed in binary $x \\= \\\\sum\\_i a\\_i(x) 2^{\\-i}$ or decimal $x \\= \\\\sum\\_i b\\_i(x) 10^{\\-i}$) is a stable (i.e., continuous) operation on the abstract real numbers ${\\\\bf R}$, but when viewed in a binary or decimal representation system becomes \"uncomputable\". For instance, the square of $1\\.414213\\\\dots$ could be either $1\\.99999\\\\dots$ or $2\\.0000\\\\dots$, depending on exactly what is going on in the $\\\\dots$; hence questions such as \"what is the first digit of the square of $1\\.414213\\\\dots$\" are uncomputable. But this is an artefact of the [numeral representation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) used and is not an indicator of any lack of stability or computability for any actual computational\nproblem that involves the abstract real numbers (rather than an artificial problem that is sensitive to the choice of numeral representation used). In contrast, floating point division when the denominator is near zero is a true singularity; regardless of what numeral system one uses, this operation is genuinely discontinuous (in a dramatic fashion) on the abstract reals and generates actual instabilities that cannot be explained away as mere coordinate singularity artefacts.\n\nReturning back to matrices, whereas the individual eigenvectors $u\\_i(A)$ of a real symmetric matrix $A$ are not uniquely defined (there is a choice of sign for $u\\_i(A)$, even when there are no repeated eigenvalues) or continuously dependent on $A$, the spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A :\\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\lambda\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$ is unambiguous; it is the unique projection\\-valued measure for which one has the functional calculus\n$$ f(A) \\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\bf R} f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$$\nfor any polynomial $f$ (or indeed for any continuous function $f \\\\colon {\\\\bf R} \\\\to {\\\\bf R}$). The spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A$ depends continuously on $A$ in the [vague topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vague_topology); indeed one has the inequality\n$$ \\\\\\| f(A) \\- f(B) \\\\\\|\\_F \\\\leq \\\\\\|f\\\\\\|\\_\\\\text{Lip} \\\\\\|A\\-B\\\\\\|\\_F$$\nfor any real symmetric $A,B$ and any Lipschitz $f$, where $\\\\\\|\\\\\\|\\_F$ denotes the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm) (also known as the Hilbert\\-Schmidt norm or 2\\-Schatten norm). This allows for the possibility for stable computation of this measure, and indeed standard algorithms such as tridiagonalisation methods using (for instance) the QR factorisation and Householder reflections do allow one to compute this measure in a numerically stable fashion (e.g., small roundoff errors only lead to small variations in any test $\\\\int\\_{\\\\bf R} f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$ of the spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A$ against a given test function $f$), although actually demonstrating this stability rigorously for a given numerical SVD algorithm does require a non\\-trivial amount of effort.\n\nThe practical upshot of this is that if one uses a numerically stable SVD algorithm to compute a quantity that can be expressed as a numerically stable function of the spectral measure (e.g., the inverse $A^{\\-1}$, assuming that the spectrum is bounded away from zero), then the computation will be stable, despite the fact that the representation of this spectral measure in eigenvalue/eigenvector form may contain coordinate instabilities. In examples involving eigenvalue collision such as the one you provided in your post, the eigenvectors can change dramatically (while the eigenvalues remains stable), but when the time comes to apply the SVD to compute a stable quantity such as the inverse $A^{\\-1}$, these dramatic changes \"miraculously\" cancel each other out and the algorithm becomes numerically stable again. (This is analogous to how a stable floating point arithmetic computation (avoiding division by very small denominators) applied to an input $x \\= 1\\.99999\\\\dots$ and an input $x' \\= 2\\.00000\\\\dots$ will lead to outcomes that are very close to each other (as abstract real numbers), even though all the digits in the representations of $x$ and $x'$ are completely different; the changes in digits \"cancel each other out\" at the end of the day.)\n\n\\[The situation is a bit more interesting when applying the SVD to a non\\-symmetric matrix $A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\sigma\\_i(A) u\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$. Now one gets two spectral measures, $\\\\mu\\_{(A^\\* A)^{1/2}} \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} v\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$ and $\\\\mu\\_{(AA^\\*)^{1/2}} \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$ which are numerically stable, but these don't capture the full strength of the SVD (for instance, they are not sufficient for computing $A^{\\-1}$). The non\\-projection\\-valued spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$ does capture the full SVD in this case, but is only stable using the vague topology on the open half\\-line $(0,\\+\\\\infty)$, that is to say $\\\\int\\_0^\\\\infty f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$ varies continuously with $A$ as long as $f$ is a test function compactly supported in $(0,\\+\\\\infty)$, but is unstable if tested by functions that do not vanish at the origin. This is ultimately due to a genuine singularity in the [polar decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_decomposition) of a non\\-selfadjoint matrix when the matrix becomes singular, which in one dimension is simply the familiar singularity in the polar decomposition of a complex number near the origin.]"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A numerical analyst is implementing an algorithm to compute eigenvectors of symmetric matrices using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

The key insights are:\n\n1. The second derivative test gives inconclusive results when f''(x) = 0 at a critical point.\n2. While many inflection points occur where f''(x) = 0, this condition alone is not sufficient to guarantee an inflection point.\n3. The concept of undulation points is mentioned, suggesting more complex behavior is possible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all points where f'(x) = 0 and f''(x) = 0 are inflection points.

This means finding an exact optimal solution is computationally infeasible for large instances.\n\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm (option A) is not suitable for this problem as it finds the shortest path between two points, not an optimal tour through multiple points.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to resolve their issue and allow for the creation of the desired Venn diagram?\n\nA) Directly include the venn package using \\usepackage{venn} in the LaTeX preamble\nB) Create a standalone MetaPost file, compile it separately, and then include the resulting .mps file in the LaTeX document\nC) Modify the LaTeX document to use TikZ instead of MetaPost for creating Venn diagrams\nD) Add the venn package to the outputtemplate in the MetaPost code within the LaTeX document\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach to resolve the issue is to create a standalone MetaPost file, compile it separately, and then include the resulting .mps file in the LaTeX document. This method addresses several key points:\n\n1. It separates the MetaPost code from the LaTeX document, reducing complexity and potential conflicts.\n2. It allows for direct use of the venn package within the MetaPost file, avoiding the \"not found\" error encountered when trying to use \\usepackage{venn} in LaTeX.\n3. The process described in the documentation (running mpost, then tex, then dvips) ensures proper compilation and generation of the Venn diagram.\n4. The resulting .mps file can be easily included in the LaTeX document using \\includegraphics, as shown in the example.\n\nOption A is incorrect because directly using \\usepackage{venn} in LaTeX was explicitly stated to cause a \"not found\" error. Option C, while potentially a valid alternative, doesn't address the specific goal of using MetaPost and the venn package.

The write bit allows the affected user to create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes, whilst the read bit allows the affected user to list the files within the directory. Since intermediate directories in the path also affect this, the permissions must be set appropriately leading up to the ultimate destination that you intend to upload to.\n\nIn the latter case, look at your `vsftpd.conf`. `write_enable` must be true to allow writing (and it is false by default).

When comparing what people write there online with the actual research articles of Einstein and Bell, it seems to me \\- put drastically \\- that people online talk about something but not about Bell and Einstein. Let me explain, what I mean. \n\nOnline most of the times the logical structure of the argument is roughly given in the following way (see, e.g., [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) in the first few paragraphs): \n\nAssuming locality *and* pre\\-existing properties, Bell's inequalities follow. Quantum mechanics' predictions (and experiments) are in contradiction to the inequality. Hence, one can abandon *either* locality *or* pre\\-existing properties. \n\nReading the EPR paper (available [here](http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777)) however, the structure seems to be quite different. They consider the following *criterion* of an element of the physical reality (and a criterion is not an assumption!): If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e. with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity. This, I think, is very reasonable. One can even very well argue that this is an analytical statement because of the phrase 'without in any way disturbing a system'. So one does not have to *assume* the correctness of the criterion as it is true anyhow! \n\nIt is employed in the following situation (Bohm's version of the EPR set\\-up): \n\nThink of the singlet state of two spin\\-1/2 particles with total spin zero. If one measures the spin in the x direction of particle A, one can predict with certainty the spin in x direction of particle B, no matter how far the particles are separated (think of a space\\-like separation). For the sake of the argument it is not needed that we consider different directions for the two particles. \n\nNow assuming locality, they must conclude by their criterion that there really exist pre\\-existing properties. That is Einstein. \n\nSo, the correct reasoning should be (also in Bell's understanding as he pointed out repeatedly) that locality *implies* the pre\\-existing properties. The consequence of Bell's inequalities then is that one cannot abandon either locality or pre\\-existing properties but *must abandon locality*. \n\nSo, who's right? Why are there two different conclusions? Are Einstein and Bell missing an essential point? I often read that counterfactual definiteness is tacitly assumed. But that isn't an assumption right? It is simply a property of the singlet state if one measures the same spin direction for both particles which is sufficient here. \n\nIt would be very much appreciated if it could be pointed out in Einstein's and Bell's original papers where the mistakes or debatable passages are (if there are any), since I think they are a very good basis for this discussion. Thanks. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Have a look at [this table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison_of_interpretations). Note that, in particular, true [counterfactual definiteness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness) is rare among the interpretations.\n\nCounterfactual definiteness (which is what is usually called *realism* in the context of Bell's theorem) says that we can meaningfully talk about *every* result of *every* measurement, regardless of whether it is performed or not. That we can predict a *single* measurement with definiteness is not sufficient for counterfactual definiteness, it must be the case for *all*. Bell's derivation of his theorem assumes locality *and* that the probabilities to measure the particle at certain angles \"exist\", i.e. can be used in statistical calculations as if they are real, definite probabilities, and reality violates Bell's inequality, so at the very least it is either non\\-local or has no counterfactual definiteness. Note that \"no counterfactual definiteness\" does **not** prohibit that *some* things may be counterfactually determined.\n\nThe EPR argument shows then merely that it is not sufficient to give up CD to preserve locality \\- see again the table of interpretation and note that there are indeed interpretations which are neither local nor have CD. That the definiteness of *some* measurements can be achieved by entanglement even for spacelike separated measurements is as per the EPR argument the OP relates is the other hurdle a interpretation must take to call itself *local*. The Copenhagen interpretation throws its hands up and just says \"Fine, non\\-locality it is, then\" concerning this \"collapse\" of the wave\\-function, but Many Worlds and others (think they) find a way around.\n\n---\n\n\\[*Gets out the soapbox*]  \n\nAs I do not grow tired to remark, none of this has *any* physical implications. Whether the world is local, collapsing and non\\-CD or non\\-local, non\\-collapsing and CD has no bearing on the fact that *all* interpretations must predict the same things and are empirically indistingushable. You may like one better than the others, but they are nothing more than soothing balm for our minds that feel incapable of dealing with the unadorned quantum world. *\"Shut up and calculate\"* remains the mantra of the working physicist."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the EPR argument and Bell's inequalities, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is analyzing the implications of the EPR argument and Bell's inequalities. Which of the following statements most accurately represents the relationship between locality, counterfactual definiteness (CD), and the conclusions drawn from these concepts?\n\nA) Bell's theorem proves that quantum mechanics must abandon either locality or counterfactual definiteness, but not necessarily both.\n\nB) The EPR argument demonstrates that locality alone implies the existence of pre-existing properties, making counterfactual definiteness unnecessary.\n\nC) Both the EPR argument and Bell's theorem require the assumption of counterfactual definiteness to reach their conclusions about locality.\n\nD) The EPR argument shows that some measurements can be counterfactually determined, while Bell's theorem proves that full counterfactual definiteness is incompatible with quantum mechanics if locality is maintained.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation and understanding their subtle relationships. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The EPR argument, as explained in the documentation, shows that for certain entangled systems (like the singlet state), we can predict with certainty the outcome of a measurement on one particle based on the measurement of another, even when they are spatially separated. This demonstrates that some measurements can be counterfactually determined under the assumption of locality.\n\n2. Bell's theorem, on the other hand, goes further. It assumes both locality and full counterfactual definiteness (the ability to assign definite values to all possible measurements, even those not performed) to derive the Bell inequalities. The violation of these inequalities by quantum mechanics and experiments shows that at least one of these assumptions must be false.\n\n3. The documentation points out that \"true counterfactual definiteness is rare among the interpretations\" of quantum mechanics, and that Bell's derivation assumes that probabilities for all possible measurements \"exist\" and can be used in calculations.\n\n4. The answer correctly distinguishes between the partial counterfactual definiteness shown by the EPR argument (for specific measurements) and the full counterfactual definiteness assumed in Bell's theorem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the implications of Bell's theorem and doesn't capture the nuance between partial and full counterfactual definiteness. Option B is incorrect because it misrepresents the EPR argument, which doesn't prove that locality alone implies pre-existing properties without the criterion of reality.

Perhaps $c(n)$ even grows linearly in $n$?\n\nIs someone aware of something in that direction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an answer (see the last point). It differs from what I had been claiming in my first post. There I was saying that any positive bilinear module $\\\\Lambda$ over $\\\\mathbf Z\\[\\\\frac 12]$ was representable by some euclidean module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Z\\[\\\\frac 12]$. This is true (with $n\\\\leq \\\\text{rk}(\\\\Lambda)\\+3$), but is of no use in our situation. \n\nNevertheless the same technics show that any positive bilinear $m$\\-dimensional module over $\\\\mathbf Z$ is representable by somebody in the same genus than the euclidean module of rank $m\\+4$. This is proved here in the third point, since it might be of interest.\n\nIn terms of matrices, as in the OP, it says that for any symmetric positive definite matrix $M\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_m(\\\\mathbf Z)$ there exists a symmetric positive definite matrix $G\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_{m\\+4}(\\\\mathbf Z)$ with determinant $1$ and at least one odd diagonal entry, and a matrix $Q\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Mat}\\_{m\\+4,m}(\\\\mathbf Z)$ such that the following holds :\n$$Q^t.G.Q\\=M\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ .$$\n\nLet $M$ be a positive definite symmetric $m\\\\times m$ matrix. Let $\\\\mathrm{M}$ be the bilinear module $(\\\\mathbf{Z}^m,M)$. The question can be rephrased :\n\nWhat is the smallest value $n$ such that the standard euclidean bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ represents $\\\\mathrm{M}$. \n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ First note that in general, such an $n$ doesn't exist. Indeed, a positive definite integral lattice decomposes as the orthogonal sum of indecomposable (for the orthogonal direct sum) lattices in a unique manner. In particular, the only unimodular (i.e. $\\\\det(M)\\=1$) lattice $\\\\mathrm{M}$ represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ are isomorphic to $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_m$. \n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Over $\\\\mathbf Q$, the space $\\\\mathrm{M}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q$ for some $n\\\\leq m\\+3$. This follows from the Hasse principle (that implies that a rank $4$ positive definite space represents $1$), Witt cancellation, and the fact that, for example, $(\\\\mathrm{M}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf Q)^{\\\\perp 4}$ is euclidean, as a computation of Hasse\\-Minkowski symbols shows.\n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ It follows that over $\\\\mathbf Z$, any bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by some bilinear module $\\\\mathrm{N}$ lying in the genus of $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n}$, for some $n\\\\leq m\\+4$ (the addition of a one dimensional module $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_1$ might be necessary when $m\\+3$ is a multiple of $8$, in order to ensure that $\\\\mathrm{N}$ is odd).\n\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Finally, here is an answer to the question. Let $M$ be an $m$\\-dimensional submodule of $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$. Let $P$ be its orthogonal. Let $\\\\pi : \\\\mathrm{I}\\_n\\\\otimes Q\\\\to M\\\\otimes Q$ be the orthogonal projection. Then $\\\\pi(\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n)$ is contained in $M^\\\\sharp$ (the dual lattice of $M$ in $M\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf Q$), and there exists a smallest $d$ such that $M^\\\\sharp\\\\subset d^{\\-1}M$. Let $S$ be the sphere of unitary vectors in $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$. Then the vectors of $d.\\\\pi(S)\\\\subset M$ have squared length smaller than $d^2$. If the number of such vectors is smaller than $\\\\mathrm{card}(S)\\=2^n$, this means that a vector of squared length $2$ in $I\\_n$ lies in $P$, so $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is in fact represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-2}\\\\perp \\<2\\>$. If once again the same phenomenon occurs, then $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is in fact represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-4}\\\\perp \\<2,2\\>$ which is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\-2}$. So what we get is :\n\nLet $d$ be the smallest integer such that $\\\\mathrm{M}^\\\\sharp\\\\subset \\\\frac 1d\\\\mathrm{M}$. Let $B\\_d(\\\\mathrm{M})$ denote the number of non\\-trivial vectors of $M$ in the ball of radius $d$. Let $n\\_0$ be the floor of $2\\+\\\\log\\_2(B\\_d(\\\\mathrm{M}))$. If $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_n$ for some $n$, then $\\\\mathrm{M}$ is represented by $\\\\mathrm{I}\\_{n\\_0}$.\n\nI hope there are better bounds, but I cannot see how to get them."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is working on generalizing the four-square theorem to matrix decompositions.

Cipher Suite Support\n\nAlso you should investigate from the client where you're running SSH which cipher suites are being presented to your laptop's SSH server. You can do this using `ssh -vvvv ....` to see what ciphers are available on your client like so:\n\n```\n$ ssh -Q cipher\n3des-cbc\naes128-cbc\naes192-cbc\naes256-cbc\nrijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se\naes128-ctr\naes192-ctr\naes256-ctr\naes128-gcm@openssh.com\naes256-gcm@openssh.com\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n\n```\n\nYou'll also want to investigate several other components of the cipher suite.\n\n* [Ciphers](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#Ciphers): `ssh -Q cipher`\n* [MACs](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#MACs): `ssh -Q mac`\n* [KexAlgorithms](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#KexAlgorithms): ssh \\-Q kex\n* [PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes): $ ssh \\-Q key\n\nThe man page's details on `-Q` as well:\n\n> ```\n>  -Q query_option\n>          Queries ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2.

This approach directly addresses the root cause of the error, which is likely related to the binary encoding of BLOB data.\n\nThe error message shows binary garbage, suggesting that the Windows system is misinterpreting binary data in the dump file. This is often caused by differences in how Linux and Windows handle binary data, especially for large files containing BLOB data like images.\n\nOption A (compression) wouldn't solve the encoding issue and might even exacerbate it. Option C (using a graphical client) might work in some cases, as mentioned in the answer, but it's not addressing the fundamental problem and may not be reliable across different client versions or for very large files. Option D (splitting the file) could potentially work around size limitations but wouldn't solve the encoding problem and might introduce new issues with data integrity.\n\nThe `--hex-blob` option encodes binary data in a hexadecimal format that is more universally compatible between different systems. This ensures that the binary data (like JPG images mentioned in the question) is properly encoded in the dump file and can be correctly interpreted when imported on the Windows machine.

It's running Windows Server and serving all the files in our office. We have external drives to back it up to we just need some software to automate it for us. What kind of general recommendations can the SF crowd make as to what piece of software we should use and best practices for backing up a company networked file server?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **General statements re: backup**\n\nI'm not going to get into specifics of backup technologies, software, operating systems, etc. in this part. Nor am I going to get into specific techniques and policies (various rotation schedules, using synthetic backup, etc). I'm going to stick to basics here, but I'd advise you, once you understand the basics, to dig deeper into how the requirements of your environment affect your needs.\n\nAbove all else, the *point of backup is to be able to restore data*. We don't run backups for backup's sake. Above all else you need to know that your backup strategy (including the specific data storage technology used, the software used to perform the backup, your media rotation strategy, and all the other factors that go into making your backup strategy work) will actually work to allow you to restore data. This means that you need to test your backup strategy under as close to real world conditions as you can to be sure that it really works. The time to test your backup strategy is *NOT* when you have a real need to restore data.\n\nBackup should provide several basic attributes:\n\n* Sufficient coverage to make a restoration efficient. While you might think that backing\\-up only your data files is necessary (because you can just re\\-install the application software) the trade\\-off in using less space on the backup media and less time in taking the backup is often not a \"win\" when you figure the time taken during a high\\-pressure restore scenario to re\\-install software that could have just been restored from backup. Assume that you should backup *everything* and think long and hard about why you would exclude something from backup.\n* Sufficient frequency as to balance the cost of data loss with the cost and practicality of backup. A source that stores files for many users may have tens of thousands of dollars (or more) of worker\\-productivity invested in the files stored on it each day. More frequent backups will cost more, but the cost may be justified by the expense associated with data loss if the backups don't happen frequently enough. You need to understand, from the users who use the source data being backed\\-up, what the cost associated with data loss would be to the business and make the case for backup with sufficient frequency as to minimize that cost.\n* Off\\-site storage to mitigate physical disaster. Keeping all your backups in physical proximity to the source data is a recipe for data loss during physical disaster. Floods, fires, thefts, etc, can all destroy the source data. If the backup medias are co\\-located with the source data then you risk destruction of the backup media at the same time as the source data. Be sure to think about confidentiality and integrity requirements in off\\-site storage strategy. Sending an unencrypted copy of your data home with an employee (who, invariably, leaves it in their car to be stolen) isn't necessarily a great off\\-site rotation strategy. Securing your off\\-site copies from tampering and unauthorized disclosure is just as important as having off\\-site copies.\n* A history of multiple backups to allow future restores. It may be necessary to restore data from some time in the past, and keeping only a few (or worse, only one) generation of backup media is a terrible idea. Someone may not realize that they need data restored until days, weeks, or months after the data is lost. Having multiple generations of backup media allows for restoration in the future. This is another area where a trade\\-off of cost versus business need is very important. The backup should fulfill any legal or organizational needs the business with respect to retention of data for restore. (It's important not to confuse backup with archival here, either. They're orthogonal concerns that share some similar attributes and may use the same technology, but they're not the same thing.) In some cases, retaining too many backups can be a bad thing, so be sure that the business understands any legal ramifications for backup retention.\n* Integrity of backed\\-up data. Part of testing your backups should involve verifying the integrity of the data that's restored. For some businesses this may be as simple as restoring a few files regularly and checking them out. For businesses with very strict security requirements this may amount to periodically sending a backup media to a third party for restoration and validation in a \"clean room\" environment. At the very least, you should be able to validate that mission critical applications and data are able to be restored with integrity preserved. An attacker who is corrupting your data may also corrupt your backup so that it reports that data has integrity when it doesn't. Be aware that keeping your multiple backup history in an \"online\" state may cause it to be subject to breaches of integrity by attackers. Some backup technologies (tape, for example) allow data to be kept in a totally offline capacity to allow physical barriers to help protect integrity (keeping the media under lock and key with a documented chain\\-of\\-custody).\n* Backup and restore within an allotted time window. Your backup and, even more importantly your restore, should be able to be accomplished in an amount of time that satisfy's the needs of the business. An online backup, for example, sounds like a great deal until you find out, in an emergency, that restoring your 200GB of data will take 3 days of constant streaming of data over your DSL line. Keep restoration windows in mind when choosing a backup technology.\n\nWhen you're evaluating specific technologies (disk\\-based backup, tape backup, online backup, etc) and specific backup strategies (grandfather / father / son media rotation, daily differential and weekly full backups, etc) think about how the interplay of software, hardware, and procedure work together to create solutions (or problems) that help (or hinder) fulfilling the requirements of backup. There are no blanket \"right answers\" and it varies for each business and, within a business, for different types of resources being backed\\-up.\n\nSpecific application software may have its own requirements that affect how to your run backups. Database servers (and database\\-like servers, like Microsoft Exchange) have their own peculiarities that you may have to contend with when designing your backups strategy. \n\nStorage and filesystem features, like snapshots or live duplication, may help you perform backups of \"live\" data under tight windows. \n\n---\n\n**Your specific needs**\n\nIn the case of your specific application you describe you should probably look at how the built\\-in Windows Image Backup functionality can help you protect the operating system, configuration, and data. The built\\-in backup functionality isn't very sophisticated when it comes to policy and scheduling, though, so you may want to evaluate third\\-party software offerings (Symantec Backup Exec, CommVault, Bacula, etc) if you need a more sophisticated solution.\n\nTalk to the people who store data on your server and find out what their tolerance is for data loss, what kind of retention windows they'd like to have, what their security concerns are, and what type of restoration timeline is required to help justify the budget for hardware, software, and labor. I'd strongly urge you to consider an off\\-site component, as well. Perhaps you'll find that using hard disks for off\\-site storage works well, but I'm personally of the opinion that there isn't an \"enterprise ready\" hard disk\\-based backup solution yet (one that's cost effective, reliable, and that operates consistently)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about backup strategies, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A medium-sized company is revising its backup strategy for its Windows Server file server.

This approach correctly addresses the behavior of the integrand over the entire domain and leverages key mathematical principles:\n\n1. It recognizes that sin\u00b9\u2070x \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 \u211d and that sin\u00b9\u2070x > c for x in intervals [\u03c0/4 + 2n, 3\u03c0/4 + 2n] where n \u2208 \u2115.\n\n2.

It then uses the limit comparison test to show that this simpler integral diverges, proving that the original integral must also diverge.\n\nThis strategy demonstrates a deep understanding of integral properties, trigonometric functions, and convergence tests, requiring the integration of multiple mathematical concepts and critical thinking.\n\nOption A is incorrect because showing \u222b\u2080^\u03f5 ln x dx diverges to -\u221e doesn't prove the divergence of the original integral, as it focuses on the wrong end of the interval and doesn't account for the sin\u00b9\u2070x term.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the inequality is actually reversed for small positive x, and this approach doesn't address the behavior of the integrand over the entire domain.\n\nOption D is not effective because u-substitution alone is unlikely to simplify this integral sufficiently to determine convergence, given its complexity."}, "63": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/05", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/184863", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/125700/"], "docs_id": 184863, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: IPhoto had a trash bin, I need to delete images when and if I want, but I can't find the bin on the new Photos?

The correct answer, A, accurately describes a key difference between C# and JavaScript. In C#, being statically typed means that variable types must be explicitly declared at compile-time, and the type of a variable cannot change during runtime. This is in contrast to JavaScript, where variables can hold values of any type and can change types dynamically.\n\nOption B is incorrect because C# is actually an object-oriented language, so no such conversion would be necessary.

However I fail to connect these together as REST is quite CRUD\\-like and event sourcing is task based. I was wondering how can you designed the creation of commands based on requests to REST server. Consider this example:\n\nWith REST you can put a new state to the resource called File. In one request you can send new file name, you can change the parent folder and/or change owner of the file and so on.\n\nHow to construct the server so I can use event sourcing. I was thinking about these possibilities:\n\n1. Determine on server which fields were changed and create appropriate commands (`RenameFileCommand`, `MoveFileCommand`, `ChangeOwnerCommand`, ...) and dispatch these individually. However in this setup, each of the command can fail leaving others out of transaction and thus out of \"atomic\" change to the resource.\n2. Dispatch only one command (`UpdateFileCommand`) and in the command handler, more precisely in the aggregate, determine which fields were changed and send individual events instead (`FileRenamedEvent`, `FileMovedEvent`, `OwnerChangedEvent`, ...)\n3. This one I don't like at all: In the request to the server I would specify in the headers which command to use, because the UI is still task based (but communication is done via REST). However it will fail in any other use of REST communication (e.g. in external apps) as they are not bound to change only the one field in one request. Also I bring quite a big coupling into the UI, REST, and ES\\-based backend.\n\nWhich one would you prefer or is there any better way to handle this?\n\nSide note: app written in Java and Axon Framework for event\\-sourcing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you may have a user\\-process to implementation mismatch here.\n\nFirst: will a user honestly want to perform *multiple* changes to a file simultaneously?\nA rename (which may or may not include a change of path?), change of ownership, and perhaps change of file contents (for sake of argument) seem like separate actions.\n\nLets take the case where the answer is \"yes\" \\- your users really do want to make these changes simultaneously.\n\nIn that case, I'd strongly recommend against any implementation that sends multiple events \\- `RenameFileCommand`, `MoveFileCommand`, `ChangeOwnerCommand` \\- to represent this **single** user intent.\n\nWhy? Because events can fail. Maybe its extremely rare, but your user submitted an operation that looked atomic \\- if a single one of the downstream events fails, then your application state is now invalid.\n\nYou are also inviting race hazards on a resource that is clearly shared between each of the event handlers. You will need to write \"ChangeOwnerCommand\" in such a way that the file name and file path do not matter, because they could be out of date by the time the command is received. \n\nWhen implementing a non\\-event driven restful system with moving and renaming files, I prefer to ensure consistency by using something like an eTag system \\- ensure that the version of the resource being edited is the version that the user last retrieved, and fail if it has been modified since then. But if you are dispatching multiple commands for this single user operation, you will need to increment your resource version after each command \\- so you have no way to know that the resource the user is editing really is the same version as the resource they last read.\n\nWhat I mean by that is \\- what if someone else performs another operation on the file at nearly the same time. The 6 commands could stack up in any order. If we had just 2 atomic commands, the earlier command could succeed and the later command could fail \"resource has been modified since it was last retrieved\". But there is no protection against this when the commands are not atomic, so system consistency is violated.\n\nInterestingly there is a movement toward something like event based architecture in REST, called \"Rest without PUT\", recommended in the [Thoughtworks technology radar, Jan 2015](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/rest-without-put). There is a considerably longer blog about [Rest without PUT here](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rest-api-design-resource-modeling).\n\nEssentially, the idea is that POST, PUT, DELETE and GET are fine for small applications, but when you need to start assuming how put and post and delete might be interpreted at the other end, you introduce coupling. (e.g. \"when I DELETE the resource associated with my bank account, the account should be closed\") And the solution proposed is to treat REST in a more Event sourced way. i.e. Lets POST the user intent as a single event resource.\n\nThe other case is simpler. If your users don't want to do all those operations simultaneously, don't let them. POST an event for each user intent. Now you can use etag versioning on your resources.\n\nAs for the other applications which are using a very different API to your resources. That smells like trouble. Can you construct a facade of the old API on top of your RESTful API and point them at the facade? i.e. expose a service that performs multiple updates to a file in sequence via the REST server?\n\nIf you neither build the RESTful interface on top of the old solution, nor build a facade of the old interface on top of the REST solution, and attempt to maintain both APIs pointing at a shared data resource, you will experience major headaches."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Event Sourcing and RESTful APIs, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A development team is designing a system that needs to integrate Event Sourcing with a RESTful API for file management. They want to allow users to simultaneously rename a file, change its parent folder, and modify its owner in a single API call. Which approach best balances RESTful principles, Event Sourcing concepts, and system consistency?\n\nA) Implement multiple commands (RenameFileCommand, MoveFileCommand, ChangeOwnerCommand) triggered by a single REST call, each generating its own event\nB) Create a single UpdateFileCommand that internally generates multiple events (FileRenamedEvent, FileMovedEvent, OwnerChangedEvent) based on the changes\nC) Design a new \"FileModificationEvent\" resource that encapsulates all desired changes and is posted as a single event via the REST API\nD) Use HTTP headers in the REST call to specify which commands to execute on the server-side, maintaining a one-to-one mapping between REST calls and commands\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer, C, aligns with the \"REST without PUT\" approach mentioned in the Thoughtworks technology radar, which suggests treating REST in a more event-sourced way by posting user intent as a single event resource. This approach addresses several key issues:\n\n1. It maintains atomicity of the operation, preventing partial updates if one part of the change fails.\n2. It avoids race conditions that could occur with multiple separate commands.\n3. It preserves the event-sourcing paradigm while still working within a RESTful architecture.\n4. It allows for versioning and consistency checks (e.g., using ETags) on the resource level.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it risks inconsistency if some commands fail while others succeed. Option B, while better than A, still doesn't fully align with RESTful principles and may complicate the command handler. Option D introduces tight coupling between the UI and backend, which is discouraged in the documentation.\n\nThis solution represents a real-world application of combining Event Sourcing with RESTful APIs, requiring critical thinking about system design rather than mere memorization of concepts."}, "68": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/02/23", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/330273", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/54664/"], "docs_id": 330273, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I have some observations $(x\\_i,y\\_i)$ from some population\u2014y is binary and x is a real number or vector of real numbers.\n\n```\nx    y\n1    1\n1    0\nnan  1\nnan  0\n...\n4    1\n\n```\n\nI would like to build a model to predict $y\\|x$\n\nAssume all cases have $y$ and that I remove all, for example, 50% of the cases that have missing $x$.\n\nWe then have a predictive model $m$ for $y\\|\\\\{x, \\\\text{$x$ not missing}\\\\}$. This could be extremely useful. For example, suppose that we are trying to predict some disease; any time someone presents with $x$ not missing, we can use our model. It's too bad that we cannot say anything for those with $x$ missing, but we have generally improved the world for the subpopulation for which $x$ is collected.\n\nIf, however, we remove cases with missing $x$, and we then (1\\) decide to use $m$ on cases with $x$ missing or (2\\) make some statement about the whole population based on our estimated coefficient, this is clearly not correct. For (1\\), we would be using the model on a population different than the one for which it was trained. For (2\\), we would be ignoring the bias we might have introduced by removing cases with missing $x$. \n\nI think it is for the second reason especially that removing missing data gets a bad rap. However, using $m$ as originally described *if you are honest about the model not applying to cases with missing x* seems to be a good idea (although not the $best$ idea, which would be to impute and have $m'$ for the whole population), and not to be kind of incorrect like (1\\) or (2\\). In this way, removing missing data does not introduce 'bias' it introduces constraints on the usability of the model?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It Depends\n----------\n\nWhether excluding cases with missing data is fine or not depends on a few factors. Whatever choice is made requires justification, so there is a bit or work to do with the data. The more ancillary information available to you, the better you can make a choice. Testing the randomness of the missing values is essential to guide your steps. This is because things become much more complex once you start to look at biased missingness. \n\nI'll use an example of an arbitrary disease that requires some blood test and a questionaire. \n\nAre values \n\nMissing Completely At Random (MCAR): no pattern at all to the missingness. This may be that one subject is missing because the person got caught in traffic and didn't have time to complete all the tests, another because they faint at the sight of needles, another because the doctor's scrawl was completely uninterpretable. The reasons are unnconnected to each other and to whether the person has the disease or not.\n\nMissing At Random (MAR). Has a relationship with what you have observed, but is not due to the underlying value. For example a questionnaire answer may be more likely to be missing in old subjects who have worse memory, but the likelihood of forgetting is not related what the answer would have been. Age may be a risk factor in the disease, so the forgetting is confounded with disease risk even through it is not caused by the disease.\n\nMissing Not At Random (MNAR) there is a pattern to which variables are missing, the likelihood of being missing is biased by the actual value of the variable. For example, males may not wish to report impotence and choose to not report it. To diagnose this often needs additional data as you don\u2019t know what the value should be. \nSee\n[https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/missing\\-data\\-mechanism/](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/missing-data-mechanism/) which explains these and provides some advice on how to deal with the different types.\n\n---\n\nPossible Solutions\n------------------\n\nThe five options I am aware off (1st 2 you have already discussed) are:\n\n1. Ignore missing data in model. When you come to predict new\nsamples that have missing data it will return and invalid result due\nto the missing value. You are right that this approach will limit\nyour ability to make generalisations about the entire population unless you can prove that the missing data is MCAR. The model will fail when missing data is present, so you are not going to produce false predictions. Failure is useful information and not to be ignored. Mechanisms to\nhandle the failure need to be appropriately designed. This will have theoretically have a neglible effect if data is truely MCAR as the missingness is unbiased. With MNAR there is definite bias in the missingness and this would be passed onto the model that ignores missingness. With MAR there is a risk that although the missingness is not due to the disease, it may be linked to factors that are confounded with disease and so may still bias your model.\n2. Impute missing data into model. As a couple of commenters have pointed out the main value of imputation is maintaining statistical robustness of the dataset. It doesn't help the individual receiving a diagnosis if you replace their true value with (for a simple case) the mean of the population. Its aim is to preserve the overall statistical properties of the dataset for the general population. Imputation works best in a multivariate\ndataset where the relationship with other variables can help improve\nthe imputation (specific patterns in variables T, U, V, W may be\nassociated with more probable values of X) as these allow tailored estmation of the individual's value. If mechanisms causing\nmissingness (MAR or MNAR) can be identified these should be used to\nguide the imputation. Validation of the model should include missing\ndata to ensure the imputation and model is handled well in independent \nsamples. As @JWH2006 points out the extent of missingness will also affect your choice of tool \\- the lower the proportion of observations the riskier imputation becomes, requiring more powerful methods.\n3. If your variable types allow it, you can recode missing data to a new\nnumeric level in X that does not otherwise arise. This implicitly\nhandles the impact of missingness and will capture an element of any\nbias that exists. This should mitigate against missingness bias in all three categories.\n4. A mashup of 2 and 3 alongside imputation you can create a Xmissing variable (e.g.\n0 observed, 1 missing) that will be given its own model coefficient\nand confidence intervals to explicitly handle the missingness. Again, this should mitigate against bias in the missingness.\n5. If\nthere is the possibility of revisiting the data source (even for a\npartial sample of the missing and complete samples) and reacquiring\nit then this may be useful to better understand the mechanism of\nmissingness to make a more robust procedure. Above I suggested some approaches can mitigate against bias, but they will never be guaranteed to eliminate its effect. If there is any way to go back and fill in the blanks it will improve your understanding of how the missingness arose and therefore give clues on how to handle it best.\n\nRemember\n--------\n\nIt also matters if the data is truly missing as opposed to something like not\\-applicable, not\\-detected or a saturation event. Not detected events are usually recoded to half the detection limit. Saturation events usually set to the saturation threshold."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the StackExchange documentation provided:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a predictive model for a rare genetic disease using a dataset where 30% of cases have missing genetic marker data (x).

If your goal is simply to expose what is meant to be public or private there are better ways to explicit that.\n\nThe easiest I can think of is to have your module structured as follow :\n\n```\nmylib\n|-- __init__.py\n|-- objects.py\n\n```\n\nWhere `objects.py` is exactly what you already have and `__init__.py` simply does:\n\n```\nfrom .objects import create_object\n\n```\n\nSo if a user imports `mylib` the only available symbols in it will be the public API.\n\nIf there are many functions like `create_object` following naming convention, you can automate their import into `__init__.py` by including something like the following in `__init__.py`:\n\n```\nimport objects\nimport inspect\nimport sys\n\ncurrent_module = sys.modules[__name__]\ncreate_functions = [(name, func) for (name, func) in inspect.getmembers(objects, inspect.isfunction)\n                    if name.startswith('create_')]\n\nfor name, func in create_functions:\n    setattr(current_module, name, func)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Certainly!

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The critical value is defined as the \"least extreme value of the test statistic that is still in the rejection region.\" The test statistic falling just beyond this value indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\n2.

They are using the following modified Ellipse function in PostgreSQL:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Ellipse2(double precision, double precision, double precision, double precision, double precision, integer) \nRETURNS geometry AS \n$$ \nSELECT ST_Translate( ST_SetSRID( ST_Rotate( ST_Scale( ST_Buffer( ST_SetSRID( ST_Point(0,0), 3395), 0.5, $6), $3, $4), $5), 4326), $1, $2) \n$$ \nLANGUAGE 'sql';\n```\n\nThe analyst is getting ellipses that are continent-sized instead of the expected 600-meter size. What is the most likely cause of this issue and how should it be resolved?\n\nA) The SRID is being set twice, causing coordinate system conflicts. Remove the inner ST_SetSRID function.\nB) The scale factors ($3 and $4) are being applied in degrees instead of meters. Convert them to degrees before passing to the function.\nC) The ST_SetSRID function is being used instead of ST_Transform, preventing proper coordinate system conversion. Replace ST_SetSRID with ST_Transform.\nD) The buffer size (0.5) is too large for the coordinate system. Reduce it to a smaller value, such as 0.0001.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The main issue in the provided function is the misuse of ST_SetSRID instead of ST_Transform. ST_SetSRID merely assigns a new SRID to the geometry without actually transforming the coordinates, which explains why the ellipses appear much larger than expected.\n\nTo resolve this, the ST_SetSRID function should be replaced with ST_Transform, which will properly convert the coordinates from the World Mercator projection (EPSG:3395) to WGS84 (EPSG:4326). The correct function should look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ST_Translate( ST_Transform( ST_Rotate( ST_Scale( ST_Buffer( ST_SetSRID( ST_Point(0,0), 3395), 0.5, $6), $3, $4), $5), 4326), $1, $2)\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the ellipse is first created in the meter-based World Mercator projection, then properly transformed to WGS84 geographic coordinates. The other options don't address the core issue:\n\nA) While there are two ST_SetSRID functions, removing the inner one wouldn't solve the transformation problem.\nB) The scale factors are correct as they are applied in the meter-based projection; converting to degrees would introduce errors.\nD) Changing the buffer size wouldn't address the fundamental coordinate system conversion issue.\n\nThis question requires understanding of spatial databases, coordinate systems, and the specific PostGIS functions used in the given context, making it a challenging L3/L4 question in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "78": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/20", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/44089341", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5395010/"], "docs_id": 44089341, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm having difficulty aligning elements.

Option A correctly identifies that replacing the individual View components with a single View using flexDirection: 'row' and justifyContent: 'space-between' would solve the alignment issue.\n\nThis approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. It utilizes React Native's supported layout system (flexbox) rather than trying to use unsupported CSS properties like float.\n2. flexDirection: 'row' ensures the child elements are arranged horizontally.\n3. justifyContent: 'space-between' distributes the space between the elements, achieving the desired side-by-side layout.\n4.

It's the job of the disk's own boot sector to look for a bootable partition.\n\nTo make that work, you should write a Windows MBR to the disk using `ms-sys`:\n\n```\nms-sys --mbr7 /dev/sdb\n\n```\n\n(The Syslinux MBR might also work as an alternative, since it does the same thing: read the partition table and jump to the first bootable partition.)\n\nNext, once the MBR first\\-stage bootloader has found your bootable partition, *that partition* needs to have its own boot sector as well (the VBR), which will know how to find the bootable files (specifically BOOTMGR). I'm not entirely sure if mkfs.ntfs writes a proper one, but ms\\-sys can do it as well:\n\n```\nms-sys --ntfs /dev/sdb1\n\n```\n\n### UEFI mode\n\nUEFI doesn't use boot sectors and doesn't search for the \"bootable\" flag, so there's no point in setting it. Instead, the firmware directly searches for partitions which contain a recognizable filesystem.\n\nMost UEFI systems only support FAT and do not understand NTFS. There are workarounds for this (e.g. UEFI:NTFS that comes with Rufus), but you still need to start with a FAT32 partition \u2013 so might as well use it for everything.\n\n```\nmkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1\n\n```\n\nIf you were doing this with Windows 10, you would run into a problem of the `install.wim` file being too large for FAT32\\. This can be solved using `wimsplit` to generate partial .swm files, but it probably won't be an issue with Windows 7 anyway."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting email connectivity issues for a client using Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook 2013. The client's network uses a SonicWall TZ300 firewall with content filtering. Which of the following approaches is most likely to resolve the connectivity problem while maintaining optimal security?\n\nA) Disable content filtering entirely on the SonicWall TZ300 firewall\nB) Configure the firewall to allow all traffic on ports 25, 587, and 993\nC) Implement a split-tunnel VPN for Outlook traffic to bypass the firewall\nD) Selectively allow Office 365 endpoints through content filtering\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the given scenario. The correct approach is to selectively allow Office 365 endpoints through content filtering. This solution:\n\n1. Addresses the root cause: The content filtering is blocking Outlook's connection to Office 365 services.\n2. Maintains security: Unlike option A, it doesn't completely disable content filtering.\n3. Is more targeted than option B, which opens up too many ports and could introduce security risks.\n4. Is more practical and scalable than option C, which would add unnecessary complexity and potential performance issues.\n\nBy allowing specific Office 365 endpoints, the administrator can ensure Outlook connectivity while still benefiting from content filtering for other traffic. This approach requires identifying the necessary Office 365 URLs and IP addresses, which Microsoft publishes and updates regularly. It's a balanced solution that addresses the business need (email connectivity) while maintaining network security best practices.\n\nThe distractors represent common misconceptions or overly broad solutions that a less experienced administrator might consider, testing the ability to critically evaluate different approaches in a real-world scenario."}, "85": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/11/17", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405327", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/254118/"], "docs_id": 405327, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to execute a command to match a certain subset of files in a directory.

Why is this and how do I correct it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `[1510852838790,1510898258530]` is a standard glob operator that matches one character in the set of characters. `[ab,c]` matches either `a`, `b`, `,` or `c`. So `[1510852838790,1510898258530]` is the same as `[,01235789]` or `[,0-357-9]`. That is, it matches commas or decimal digits other than `4` and `6`.\n\n`*(...)` is a Korn shell glob operator (also supported by `zsh -o kshglob` and `bash -O extglob`) that matches 0 or more `...`.\n\nSo `*([1510852838790,1510898258530]).jpg` matches any sequence of `,01235789` characters followed by `.jpg`.\n\nIf you wanted to match any string that consists of a decimal number ranging between 1510852838790 and 1510898258530, you'd need the `<x-y>` glob operator of the `zsh` shell:\n\n```\nprintf '%s\\n' <1510852838790-1510898258530>.jpg\n\n```\n\nThe answer you're linking to refers to another feature of the `zsh` shell (again not `bash`): the `[x,y]` glob qualifier.\n\nGlob qualifiers is a `(...)` part that is added to the end of a glob to add some criteria other than those based on the name.\n\nFor instance, `*.jpg(.)` is `*.jpg` but limited to *regular files* (excluding directories, symlinks, sockets, fifos...)\n\n`*.jpg([5,10])` is the 5th to 10th files in the list of files that match `*.jpg` (sorted lexically).\n\nNote that the zsh glob qualifiers do conflict with `kshglob`. It you want to use `kshglob` (but generally you wouldn't unless you want to interpret code intended for ksh as zsh extendedglobs are generally better than ksh ones), you generally want to also disable the `bareglobqual` option (or use the ksh emulation mode with `emulate ksh` that would take care of that and also enable more ksh\\-like behaviours).\n\nThe equivalent of `ksh`'s `*(x)` in `zsh` extended globs is `x#` (like regexp `x*` except that in globs `*` is used for something else).\n\n`bash` doesn't have the `<x-y>` glob operator, nor glob qualifiers. In `bash`, you can do:\n\n```\nzsh -c \"printf '%s\\n' <1510852838790-1510898258530>.jpg\"\n\n```\n\nOr you could print all `number.jpg` files and post process the output with `awk`:\n\n```\nshopt -s extglob\nprintf '%s\\n' *([0-9]).jpg |\n  awk -F. '$1 >= 1510852838790 && $1 <= 1510898258530'\n\n```\n\nAnyway, if you're going to try and find gaps in the sequence of numbers, you'll probably want to use `awk` anyway.\n\nLike (back to using `zsh`):\n\n```\nprint -l <->.jpg(n) | awk -F. '\n  {diff = ($0 - prev) / 1000 / 60}\n  NR > 1 && (diff < 29 || diff > 31) {print $0, \"diff=\" diff}\n  {prev = $0}'\n\n```"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A DevOps engineer is trying to automate the selection of image files within a specific timestamp range using Zsh.

Option A is incorrect because it misinterprets the glob operator, matching any sequence of specified characters rather than a range. Option C, while functional, uses Bash-specific features (shopt) and is not the most Zsh-centric solution. Option D goes beyond the scope of the original problem, focusing on finding gaps in the sequence rather than selecting a specific range.\n\nOption B is the most effective solution using Zsh's advanced features. It employs the `<x-y>` glob operator, which is specific to Zsh and precisely matches the requirement to select files within a given numeric range. This approach directly addresses the engineer's need to select files within a specific timestamp range, utilizing Zsh's powerful globbing capabilities.

They've successfully added other product attributes but are struggling with displaying category names. Which approach would be most effective for implementing this feature while maintaining optimal performance?\n\nA) Modify the _prepareCollection() method to join the category table directly in the product collection query\nB) Create a new column renderer that loads the full product model for each row and retrieves categories\nC) Implement an observer that adds a new column with a custom renderer and filter callback\nD) Add a left join to the category_product table in the _addColumnFilterToCollection() method\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is to implement an observer that adds a new column with a custom renderer and filter callback. This solution offers several advantages:\n\n1. Performance: It doesn't modify the core collection query, which could negatively impact performance for large catalogs.\n2. Flexibility: The observer pattern allows for easy extension without modifying core files.\n3. Separation of concerns: The rendering logic is kept separate from the grid preparation.\n4. Filtering capability: The custom filter callback allows for efficient category-based filtering.\n\nOption A would potentially slow down the initial query significantly. Option B would be extremely inefficient, as it loads the full product model for each row. Option D is closer but doesn't provide a clean way to render and filter the category names.\n\nThe correct approach (C) uses an observer to add the column, a custom renderer to display category names, and a filter callback for efficient filtering. This aligns with Magento's best practices for extending admin grids and maintains good performance while providing the desired functionality."}, "87": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/28", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/248968", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/122721/"], "docs_id": 248968, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I couldn't find this question on here, and I've tried scouring the Internet, but to no avail. It's quite possible I'm just not searching with the appropriate keywords.\n\nThe question is regarding comma use in a sentence such as this: \n\n> I'm going out tonight, and, if you come along with me, we'll have a nice time.\n\nUpon reduction, **I** (insubordinate) \\+ **C** (conjunction) \\+ **S** (subordinate) \\+ **I** is the sentence structure. In my line of work, I commonly see I,CS,I. To me this seems incorrect. My belief is it should be I,C,S,I as above, unless the S is sufficiently small to allow for I,CSI.\n\nCan anyone clarify this for me?\n\nEDIT: Because the initial example was not the greatest, I've provided another to illustrate.\n\n> We're funding 5,500 to his Roth IRA, and, once we receive her permission, we'll be doing the same to hers.\n\nOf note is the **S** is in no way nonessential, yet I feel all commas are necessary here. The second comma seems required with the inverted clause order\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: EDIT: In the original answer, I tried to make a formal point using OP's original sentence, whose content was not suited to making that point. I have edited my answer to use a slightly different example.\n\nI believe there is a potential difference between the two variations. With the comma, \"S\" is implied to be a parenthetical insertion. Without it, \"S\" is implied to be integral to the sentence. Consider the following sentences:\n\n> (1\\) I'm going out tonight, and you can come along, if you want.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) I'm going out tonight, and you can come along if you want.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) I'm going out tonight, and, if you want, you can come along.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) I'm going out tonight, and if you want, you can come along.\n\nIn (1\\), \"if you want\" is very clearly a parenthetical. In (2\\), it's integral.\nIf you want to use an ordering where \"you can come along\" appears at the end, then whether you should use (3\\) or (4\\) depends on whether you mean something equivalent to (1\\) or something equivalent to (2\\). You should use (3\\) if you mean (1\\), and if you mean (2\\), you should use (4\\)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about comma usage in complex sentences, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A technical writer is crafting a complex sentence for a user manual and is unsure about proper comma placement. Which of the following sentences demonstrates the most appropriate use of commas for clarity and grammatical correctness?\n\nA) We'll initiate the software update and once the system reboots, you can log in to verify the changes.\n\nB) We'll initiate the software update, and, once the system reboots, you can log in to verify the changes.\n\nC) We'll initiate the software update and, once the system reboots you can log in to verify the changes.\n\nD) We'll initiate the software update, and once the system reboots you can log in to verify the changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the application of comma usage rules in a real-world scenario. Option B is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It correctly uses the I,C,S,I structure (Independent clause, Conjunction, Subordinate clause, Independent clause).\n2. The subordinate clause \"once the system reboots\" is set off by commas on both sides, treating it as a parenthetical insertion, which adds clarity to the sentence structure.\n3. This comma placement emphasizes that the subordinate clause is not integral to the main idea but provides additional information.\n4. It follows the principle demonstrated in the documentation's example: \"We're funding 5,500 to his Roth IRA, and, once we receive her permission, we'll be doing the same to hers.\"\n\nOption A lacks the necessary comma after \"and,\" which could lead to misreading the sentence structure. Option C incorrectly places a comma before the subordinate clause but not after, creating an imbalance. Option D omits the comma before the subordinate clause, which could imply that the clause is integral rather than parenthetical.\n\nThis question challenges the reader to analyze the sentence structure, apply the rules discussed in the documentation, and choose the option that best balances clarity and grammatical correctness in a technical writing context."}, "88": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/23", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2247498", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/436337/"], "docs_id": 2247498, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine a circle of radius R in 3D space with a line l running threw it's center C in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the circle. Basically, like the axel of a wheel. \n\nFrom a given point P that is not on the circle or on l, a ray extends to intersect both l and the circle. What would be the equations used to find the intersection points the ray make with the circle and l? You are given the coordinates of C and P, the radius R and the orientation of l.\n\nI am trying to model looking from a point P onto a wheel\\-axis shape and find from point of view P the point of the edge of the circle that would appear to intersect with it's axis. Of course it doesn't but it is how this 3d structure would appear in a 2d image if a camera was situated at point P.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No need to rotate anything, it is a matter of very simple geometry, which if you follow through, gives you a very simple explicit algorithm for computing the points you need. \n\nAssume the orientation of the lines $l$ is given by a vector $\\\\vec{v}$. Then the circle, call it $k$, has given center $C$ and radius $r$ and lies in the plane $\\\\beta$ passing through $C$ and orthogonal to $\\\\vec{v}$. Denote by $s$ the ray through point $P$ that intersects both line $l$ and the circle $s$. Then, since $s$ intersects $l$, the two together determines a plane $\\\\alpha$, which is orthogonal to the plane of the circle $\\\\beta$ and is transverse to the circle itself. The ray $s$ lies in this plane $\\\\alpha$ and at the same time intersects $k$ so the ray $s$ passes through the point of intersection of $k$ and $\\\\alpha$. So all you have to do is find the intersection points of the plane $\\\\alpha$ and the circle $k$ (technically, you have two solutions of your problem). It becomes even simpler when you notice that the planes $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ (the one of the circle $k$) intersect at a common line $l\\_C$ that passes thorough the circle center $C$, that is $l\\_C \\= \\\\alpha \\\\cap \\\\beta$. Therefore the intersection points between $k$ and $\\\\alpha$ are in fact the intersection points of $l\\_C$ and $k$. In other words, the two points you are looking for are exactly $l\\_C \\\\cap k$. Which, by the way, are the two points on $l\\_C$ at a distance $r$ from point $C \\\\in l\\_C$ (on either side of $C$ on $l\\_C$). \n\nAll of the above observations prompt the following algorithm:\n\n1. If the dot product $\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big) \\< 0$ then set $\\\\vec{v} :\\= \\-\\\\vec{v}$. This way we make sure both vectors $\\\\vec{v}$ and $\\\\vec{CP}$ are in the same half space with respect to the plane $\\\\beta$ defined by the circle (recall $\\\\beta$ is orthogonal to $\\\\vec{v}$).\n2. Define vector $$\\\\vec{n} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}$$ (cross product) which is orthogonal to $\\\\alpha$, and thus orthogonal to $l\\_C$.\n3. Then define vector $$\\\\vec{w} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{n} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)$$ and normalize it to $$\\\\vec{u} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\vec{w}}{\\|\\\\vec{w}\\|} \\= \\\\frac{ \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)}{\\| \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)\\|}$$ Vector $\\\\vec{u}$ is parallel to line $l\\_C$ because $l\\_C$ is orthogonal to both vectors $\\\\vec{v}$ and $\\\\vec{n}$, and vector $\\\\vec{u}$ is also orthogonal to both of them (cross product of the two).\n4. If point $O$ is the origin of the coordinate system, a point $X$ lies on the line $l\\_C$ if and only if\n$$\\\\vec{OX}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\+ t \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n5. The two intersection points $Q\\_1$ and $Q\\_2$ you are looking for are \n$$\\\\vec{OQ\\_1}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\+ r \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n$$\\\\vec{OQ\\_2}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\- r \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n\nIf I am not wrong, according to the way I have deliberately defined the relative location of the vectors, point $Q\\_1$ should be \"behind\" the line $l$ and point $Q\\_2$ \"in front\" when looking from point $P$. For further reference I will use the notations $R\\_1 \\= PQ\\_1 \\\\cap l$ and $R\\_2 \\= PQ\\_2 \\\\cap l$.\n\n6. For $i\\=1,2$ calculate the vectors $$\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\= \\\\vec{CP} \\- (\\-1\\)^{i} \\\\, r \\\\, \\\\vec{u} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\text{ and } \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\|Q\\_iP\\| \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\big(\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\\\big)}$$ i.e. the latter is a dot product and then square root. The former equality holds because $$\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\= \\\\vec{OP} \\- \\\\vec{OQ\\_i} \\= \\\\vec{CP} \\- \\\\vec{CQ\\_i} \\= \\\\vec{CP} \\- (\\-1\\)^i \\\\, r \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n7. For $i\\=1,2$ calculate $\\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\_i) \\= \\\\cos\\\\big( \\\\angle \\\\, CQ\\_iP\\\\big)$ by calculating the dot products $$\\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\_i) \\= (\\-1\\)^i\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\big(\\\\, \\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\\\,\\\\big)}{\\|{Q\\_iP}\\|}$$\n8.

Given the following scenario, which approach would be most computationally efficient and accurate for determining the apparent intersection points?\n\nA) Calculate the intersection of the viewing ray with the plane of the wheel, then project this point onto the circle's circumference\nB) Rotate the entire system so that the wheel lies in the XY plane, then solve for the intersection using 2D geometry\nC) Use vector algebra to find the intersection of a plane containing both the viewing ray and the wheel's axis, then calculate its intersection with the wheel's circle\nD) Perform a pixel-by-pixel ray tracing from the viewpoint to the wheel, checking for intersections with both the circle and the axis\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and accurate approach is option C, which aligns with the method described in the documentation. This approach leverages vector algebra to solve the problem in 3D space without requiring system rotations or computationally expensive ray tracing.\n\nThe key steps in this method are:\n1. Define a plane \u03b1 that contains both the viewing ray and the wheel's axis.\n2. Calculate the intersection line lC between plane \u03b1 and the plane \u03b2 of the wheel's circle.\n3. Find the intersection points of lC with the wheel's circle.\n\nThis method is computationally efficient because it reduces the 3D problem to a series of vector operations and a 2D circle-line intersection. It avoids the need for iterative processes or complex transformations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the 3D nature of the problem and may produce inaccurate results. Option B introduces unnecessary complexity by rotating the entire system and doesn't take full advantage of 3D vector operations.

The only difference is that in my case the variances are **unequal**.\n\nTo recap, consider a two class scenario. At the decision boundary, the posterior probability of classifying a data point into two classes will be equal i.e. $p(y\\=1\\|x) \\= p(y\\=2\\|x)$\n\nPosterior definition\n\n$p(y\\=1\\|x) \\= \\\\frac{p(x\\|y\\=1\\) \\* P(y\\=1\\)}{p(x)}$\n\n$p(y\\=2\\|x) \\= \\\\frac{p(x\\|y\\=2\\) \\* P(y\\=2\\)}{p(x)}$\n\nwhere likelihoods are Gaussian i.e.\n\n$p(x\\|y\\=1\\) \\= \\\\mathcal{N}(x\\|\\\\mu\\_1, \\\\sigma\\_1\\)$\n\n$p(x\\|y\\=2\\) \\= \\\\mathcal{N}(x\\|\\\\mu\\_2, \\\\sigma\\_2\\)$\n\nSo at the decision boundary, $p(y\\=1\\|x^\\*) \\= p(y\\=2\\|x^\\*)$ where $x^\\*$ is the threshold\n\n$\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\&p(y\\=1\\|x^\\*) \\= p(y\\=2\\|x^\\*) \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma\\_1^2}}\\\\exp(\\-\\\\frac{(x^\\* \\- \\\\mu\\_1\\)^2}{2\\\\sigma\\_1^2}) \\* P(y\\=1\\) \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma\\_2^2}}\\\\exp(\\-\\\\frac{(x^\\* \\- \\\\mu\\_2\\)^2}{2\\\\sigma\\_2^2})\\* P(y\\=2\\)\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\n$\n\nTaking log on both sides,\n\n$\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\Rightarrow \\& \\\\small\\-\\\\frac{(x^\\* \\- \\\\mu\\_1\\)^2}{2\\\\sigma\\_1^2} \\-\\\\log\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma\\_1 \\+ \\\\log P(y\\=1\\)\\= \\-\\\\frac{(x^\\* \\- \\\\mu\\_2\\)^2}{2\\\\sigma\\_2^2} \\-\\\\log\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma\\_2 \\+ \\\\log P(y\\=2\\)\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\n$\n\nTo get the threshold, we would solve for $x^\\*$ in the above equation. But since the variances are unequal this will remain a quadratic equation and hence it is possible to get complex values for $x^\\*$.\n\nIf this is the case, then what does it mean to have a complex threshold?\n\n#### Further context:\n\nI'm using a 2 component Gaussian mixture model and planning to find the threshold to create a mask as specified in the paper snippet below. As such, I was expecting the threshold to be real in order to create the mask.

The answer to your question will most likely depend on what you mean by outlier and what procedure will be used to deal with outliers. A few imaginary scenarios:\n\n1. You have photographs of animals and some of them are damaged by technical errors. In this case you would simply discard them from the entire dataset as they would equally be discarded in, as you put it, real world scenario.\n2. You have gene expression data and some genes have abnormally high expression levels. You decide to deal with this by capping the expression at some arbitrary threshold $c$. Since this is a within\\-sample procedure \\- meaning the results will be the same regardless of whether you process each sample one by one or all of them together \\- you can again perform this before splitting into training and testing.\n3. You have similar gene expression data as before with some abnormally high values but you decide to do a cross\\-validation to get an optimal threshold parameter $c$. Now you actually would have to do such outlier \"normalization\" step not only separately for testing and training data, but separately for each cross\\-validation fold.\n4. You have customer data from an insurance company where samples can have missing features. You decide to impute those features using average values from the samples of the same class. Here you would have to perform this correction after splitting into training and testing. And again \\- if you do cross validation \\- separately in each cross\\-validation fold.\n\nIn summary, your general observation about checking whether this procedure would transfer to the \"real world\" setting is on point. Or alternatively \\- you could get intuition by pondering whether a certain procedure can be performed on a single sample (such procedures are called \"in\\-sample\" or \"within\\-sample\" procedures). As an example you cannot subtract a feature\\-wise mean from a single sample because you will get all 0s.\n\nWhen dealing with an \"out\\-sample\" (between\\-sample) procedure you have to make sure that any estimation (a.k.a. \"learning\") is always done using only the data that is being used for estimation (\"training data\"). Then, once you get a value in this training data you have to use the obtained values on the testing data. And yes \\- simple things like centering the data by subtracting a feature\\-wise mean is also \"learning\". So you get the mean in the training step and subtract this training\\-data\\-obtained mean in the testing stage."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is developing a binary classification model using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with two components having unequal variances. After deriving the decision boundary equation, they find that solving for the threshold x* results in complex values. Which of the following best explains the implications of this result and the appropriate next steps?\n\nA) The complex threshold indicates that the classes are not linearly separable, and a non-linear classifier should be used instead of GMM.\n\nB) The complex threshold suggests that the assumption of Gaussian distributions for both classes is invalid, and the data should be transformed to achieve normality.\n\nC) The complex values for x* represent multiple decision boundaries in different dimensions, and the real parts should be used to create a multi-dimensional decision surface.\n\nD) The complex threshold implies overlapping class distributions, and the real part of x* should be used as the decision boundary, with the imaginary part indicating the uncertainty in classification.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The occurrence of complex values for the threshold x* when solving the quadratic equation derived from equating the posterior probabilities is a result of the unequal variances in the two Gaussian components. This situation arises when the class distributions significantly overlap.\n\nIn this case, the real part of the complex threshold can be interpreted as the primary decision boundary, while the imaginary part provides information about the uncertainty or \"fuzziness\" of this boundary. This interpretation aligns with the concept of soft clustering in GMMs, where data points can have partial membership in multiple clusters.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA) Complex thresholds don't necessarily imply non-linear separability; GMMs can still be appropriate for overlapping Gaussian distributions.\nB) Complex thresholds don't invalidate the Gaussian assumption; they're a natural consequence of unequal variances in GMMs.\nC) While this interpretation is creative, it's not the standard approach for handling complex thresholds in GMMs.\n\nTo proceed, the data scientist should:\n1. Use the real part of x* as the primary decision boundary.\n2. Consider the magnitude of the imaginary part as an indicator of classification uncertainty near the boundary.\n3. Potentially implement a \"soft\" classification scheme where points near the boundary are assigned probabilities rather than hard class labels.\n4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for probabilistic classifications, such as log-loss or Brier score.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including Gaussian Mixture Models, decision boundaries, complex numbers in classification, and practical interpretation of mathematical results in a machine learning context."}, "90": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/09", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/887173", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/321809/"], "docs_id": 887173, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was searching for understanding what is the \u201cwww\u201d at the beginning of so many web addresses in the Internet. I read in somewhere that \u201cwww\u201d is called \u201chostname\u201d.\n\nThe world \u201chostname\u201d made me go a step further in searching, I read so many threads and articles but I am still confused about that.\n\nSo I decided to ask some related questions here to make it clear and I need solid and comprehensive answers please.\n\n1. **\u201chostname\u201d vs. computer name:** Is the \u201chostname\u201d the same as the computer name, if its true, suppose that my computer is a web server and my computer name is \u201cRobin\u201d so is it correct to conclude that a hypothetical web site would be something like: `Robin.websitename.com`?\n2. **\u201chostname\u201d vs. subdomain:** If \u201cmail\u201d in `mail.google.com` and \u201cdevelopers\u201d in `developers.google.com` are called subdomains why is `en` in `en.wikipedia.org` called [hostname](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname)? What is the difference between host name and subdomain?\n3. **What is the relation between host name and fully qualified domain name (FQDN)?**\n4. **What is the \u201cwww\u201d in URL of some web sites?** As you know Google\u2019s web address is `www.google.com` but we have many web sites without \u201cwww\u201d for example: `superuser.com` and `en.wikipedia.org`. I read in this [article](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/question180.htm) that \u201cwww\u201d is just a declarative thing not more and is not related to the concept of hostname. Do you verify that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best way to explain the differences between these different items\u2014that are related but different\u2014is to break it down by example. Think of networks like a tree:\n\n* There is a trunk that separates into major branches.\n* Branches which in turn separate into smaller branches.\n* Smaller branches eventually leading to individual leaves.\n\nThe \u201ctrunk\u201d and \u201cbranches\u201d are \u201cdomains\u201d and \u201csubdomains\u201d and the leaves are individual devices, like computers. So let\u2019s start there.\n\n* **A \u201ccomputer name\u201d is strictly a local convention:** I have a computer named `giacomo1968`. This computer name is simply the name I have assigned my local machine. Nobody outside of my LAN will know this computer name; this is strictly a local setting.\n* **A \u201chostname\u201d (aka \u201cnodename\u201d) is a network identifier:** If I wanted to publicly advertise my local computer to others, I would have to attach a \u201chostname\u201d to the IP address of my computer. The \u201chostname\u201d doesn\u2019t really have to have anything to do with the computer name, but many times administrators like to use the same name to make things easier to understand. Also a \u201chostname\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean the computer is exposed to the Internet; it\u2019s just an easy way to let others on your network where/what your computer is. As [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname); emphasis is mine:\n\n> In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is **a\n> label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network** and\n> that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic\n> communication such as the World Wide Web, e\\-mail or Usenet.\n\n* **A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is just that; a fully qualified domain name:** Now that might seem confusing but you need to think of it this way: It just means in the great scheme of things, what is the actual \u201cpath\u201d to get to a computer. So let\u2019s say I have my computer named `giacomo1968` and it has a hostname on my LAN that is `giacomo1968`. Within the context of my LAN, that\u00a0`giacomo1968` is my computer name, and is my \u201chostname\u201d and can *possibly* be considered my \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d depending on my LAN architecture. Meaning let\u2019s say my office LAN has other nodes in it like, `first_floor` and `second_floor` and my \u201chostname\u201d of `giacomo1968` is on the `second_floor` network. Well, if that were the case, then my LAN\\-based \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d would be `giacomo1968.second_floor` and that is it. But let\u2019s say I worked at a big company named \u201cbig\\_company.com\u201d and my computer were somehow exposed to the world. Then in that case, my WAN\\-based \u201cfully qualified domain name\u201d could be `giacomo1968.second_floor.big_company.com` or maybe even just `giacomo1968.big_company.com` if the network administrator didn\u2019t want to be hassled with the \u201csecond\\_floor\u201d designation. Again, as [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name); emphasis is mine:\n\n> A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an\n> absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact\n> location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It\n> specifies all domain levels, including the top\\-level domain and the\n> root zone. **A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack\n> of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.**\n\n* **The \u201cwww\u201d in some website names is a \u201chostname\u201d designation that is historical in nature:** Basically, back in the 1990s when the world wide web was still in it\u2019s infancy, networks had many different services attached to them. And mainly in an academic context. So there would be a place like `whattsamattau.edu` and that school would have FTP services on `ftp.whattsamattau.edu`, email on `mail.whattsamattau.edu` and so on\u2026 So when the world wide web came along, they would just have placed the web server on `www.whattsamattau.edu`. Nowadays, everyone\u2014and seemingly everything in the world\u2014has a website. And many people just register domains just for the web service. So the historic convention of `www` is discarded in many cases. Many people have websites without `www` but will still have accommodations to redirect `www` traffic to the main, non\\-`www` hostname. But technically speaking, `www` can still be considered a hostname.\n* **BONUS (Never Asked But Mentioned/Implied): What is a \u201csubdomain\u201d in the great scheme of things:** A subdomain is basically just a child of a parent domain/hostname. So in my example of `giacomo1968.big_company.com` the `giacomo1968` can be considered a subdomain of `big_company.com` and `big_company` in that can be considered to be the \u201cdomain\u201d with `.com` being the top\\-level domain (TLD). Yet again, [as Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System); emphasis is mine:\n\n> In the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy, **a subdomain is a domain\n> that is part of a larger domain.**\n\nNow after drafting all of this, it can be confusing. Many computer names are hostnames are fully\\-qualified domain names and in some cases they could be subdomains. It\u2019s all a matter of context. And looking at articles online the words \u201cdomain,\u201d \u201chost\u201d and \u201cnode\u201d are used fairly loose and fast all over the place. So in my opinion, many uses of these terms are synonymous.\n\nWhich also helps to explain your confusion in item number 2:\n\n> If \u201cmail\u201d in `mail.google.com` and \u201cdevelopers\u201d in\n> `developers.google.com` are called subdomains why is `en` in\n> `en.wikipedia.org` called hostname? What is the difference\n> between host name and subdomain?\n\nThe `en.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain *and* a hostname. The `en` in the `en.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain of the domain name `wikipedia.org`. And `en.wikipedia.org` is in itself a hostname since `en.wikipedia.org` has an IP address connected to it and thus a computer connected to that IP address as well. Meaning the `en` itself is semantically considered a subdomain, but it is also a hostname because there is a host (computer) connected to the IP address connected to `en.wikipedia.org`. So knowing that `mail.google.com` and `developers.google.com` are hostnames as well which are both subdomains of `google.com`.\n\nTo possibly make things clearer think of it like this; let\u2019s use the non\\-existant subdomain `fakename.wikipedia.org` as an example:\n\n* The `org` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a [top\\-level domain (TLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). As a top\\-level domain it does not resolve to an IP address. Thus it is not a hostname. It is simply a naming convention.\n* The `wikipedia.org` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) and it has the *potential* to be a hostname as well if it is connected to an IP address and resolves to a computer when one goes to `wikipedia.org`.\n* The `fakename` in `fakename.wikipedia.org` is a subdomain name since it is a child domain of `wikipedia.org` in the context of the domain name itself. It can be a hostname if it connected to an IP address and resolves to a computer when one goes to `fakename.wikipedia.org`.\n\nIf you ping `fakename.wikipedia.org` you are attempting to ping the `fakename` subdomain of `wikipedia.org`. If that ping dies \u2014 which it most likely will since it is fake \u2014 that means that the host is down or it does not exist. If it dies with an IP address connected to it, that would mean the hostname `fakename.wikipedia.org` is down. If the ping dies with 100% no IP address connected to it, them it would mean that the subdomain `fakename.wikipedia.org` is an invalid hostname.\n\nYes, this can all be confusing. But what it boils down to is the difference between what a domain/subdomain is in the context of DNS entries versus what domain/subdomain is in the context of having a host/computer connected to it.\n\nSo if this all started with your curiosity about `www`, that is a historic hostname/nodename/subdomain that is not really used as a convention as much anymore but is still so commonly used that many sites have some accommodations in place to \u201ccatch\u201d requests to `www` and redirect them to the main hostname of a website."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about hostnames, domains, and related concepts, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A company is restructuring its global network architecture and needs to set up a new web service for its European division.

Option B is the best choice because:\n\n1.

It uses \"eu.globalcorp.com\" as both the hostname and web address, which is a common practice in modern web architecture. This approach eliminates the need for the historical \"www\" prefix while still providing a clear, hierarchical structure.\n3. It allows \"eu.globalcorp.com\" to function as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), uniquely identifying the European division's web server in the DNS hierarchy.\n4.

This is not to say the Professional version will lack the features, but the license will specifically prohibit the developer from using the compiler for a specific class of development, even with 3rd party or home grown solutions.\n\n**So my question is if there is a precedent of a compiler or similar creative tool prohibiting the class of work you can use it for.

It mirrors the Delphi XE3 case mentioned in the documentation, which faced significant public resistance and was ultimately dropped before the product shipped.\n\n2.

In many games, especially those involving space travel or large area transitions, cut-scenes are often used as a clever way to mask loading times for the next area. \n\nThis answer requires the student to think beyond the literal information provided and consider why a game might not allow disabling of such scenes.

Option D is unlikely, as player preferences vary widely.\n\nThe correct answer, C, represents the most probable technical reason behind the inability to skip these scenes. It explains why the feature isn't simply an aesthetic choice that could be easily disabled, but rather an integral part of the game's loading process.
