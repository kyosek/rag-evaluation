The documentation specifically recommends using the LoopJ library for handling HTTP requests in Android applications, especially for developers new to making HTTP requests in Java. LoopJ offers several advantages:\n\n1. It simplifies the process of making asynchronous HTTP requests.\n2. It handles low-level details like request retries automatically.\n3. It provides simple examples and documentation, making it easier for beginners to implement.\n4. It's specifically designed for Android, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because implementing HTTP requests from scratch is complex and error-prone, especially for beginners. It doesn't handle advanced features like request retries automatically.\n\nOption C is incorrect because WebView is primarily used for rendering web content, not for making API requests.

Can I use shuffle on a dataset which is ordered by dates?\n\n```\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, shuffle=True)\n\n```\n\nExample dataframe:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H0sM.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6H0sM.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With time\\-series data, where you can expect auto\\-correlation in the data you *should not* split the data randomly to train and test set, but you should rather [split it on time](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/351765/35989) so you train on past values to predict future. Scikit\\-learn has the [`TimeSeriesSplit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) functionality for this.\n\nThe `shuffle` parameter is needed to prevent non\\-random assignment to to train and test set. With `shuffle=True` you split the data randomly. For example, say that you have balanced binary classification data and it is ordered by labels. If you split it in 80:20 proportions to train and test, your test data would contain *only* the labels from one class. Random shuffling prevents this.\n\nIf random shuffling would break your data, this is a good argument for not splitting randomly to train and test. In such cases, you would use splits on time, or clustered splits (say you have data on education, so you sample whole schools to train and test, rather than individual students).\n\nWhen should you use `shuffle=False`? TL;DR never.\n\n* Your data was randomly sampled or was already shuffled. But shuffling one more time wouldn't hurt you. I remember seeing multiple datasets that were supposed to be randomly shuffled but weren't.\n* Your dataset is huge, so shuffling makes the whole pipeline a little bit slower. If that is the case, you probably don't want to use scikit\\-learn pipelines for preprocessing as well. If you use instead something else that scales better, still you need to make sure that it shuffles the data.\n* You don't want to split randomly and your data is already arranged in the way how you want to split it, for example, you have data collected during the 2010\\-2020 period and you want to split in 80:20 proportions with years 2010\\-2018 in train set and 2019\\-2020 in test set. Here it makes sense, but you would probably would like to use the `TimeSeriesSplit` functionality instead or write the code by hand to have greater control on what you are doing. For example, if you want to split by years, you probably don't want by accident few days of one year to land in other set than the rest of the year\\-\\-so you would rather do the split manually."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working with a time-series dataset of daily stock prices ordered by date.

A good beginner's access to OOP is often *\"start with objects representing things from the real world\"*, that is true. \n\nHowever, you **should not stop with this**!\n\nClasses can (and should) be used to structure your program in various ways. Modeling objects from the real world is one aspect of this, but not the only one. Creating modules or components for a specific task is another sensible use case for classes. A \"feature extractor\" is probably such a module, and even it contains only one **public** method `extract_features()`, I would be astonished if if does not also contain a lot of private methods and maybe some shared state. So having a class `FeatureExtractor` will introduce a natural location for these private methods.\n\n*Side note: in languages like Python which support a separate module concept one can also use a module `FeatureExtractor` for this, but in the context of this question, this is IMHO a negligible difference.*\n\nMoreover, a \"feature extractor\" can be imagined as \"a person or bot which extracts features\". That is an abstract \"thing\", maybe not a thing you will find in the real world, but the name itself is a useful abstraction, which gives everyone a notion of what the responsibility of that class is. So I disagree that this class does not \"represent anything\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented programming, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the creation and purpose of classes?\n\nA) Classes should only represent concrete objects from the real world and nothing else.\n\nB) Classes should always have multiple public methods to be considered valid.\n\nC) Classes can be used to structure programs in various ways, including representing abstract concepts or specific tasks.\n\nD) Creating a class for a single-method component like a FeatureExtractor is never appropriate in OOP.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

In the course of correcting his mistakes...\n\nWell it is true we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for electricians these days. However, honestly, this sounds like something else entirely: it sounds like a person who *knows a little bit* about electricity and has... well, we used to call it \"sophomoric\", but a pair of scientists named Dunning and Kruger made a more in\\-depth study.\n\nI'm afraid I'm not referring to the electrician :)\n\nIt is readily apparent that a) you're seeing a lot of stuff that is \"New to You\"... and b) you're doing a lot of random stuff that seems right, but you don't actually know. At least, you are asking...\n\nReceptacles must match the breaker.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis is NEC 210\\.21\\.\n\n15A receptacles belong on 15A circuits.  \n\n20A receptacles belong on 20A circuits.  \n\nThere is an exception allowing 15A receptacles on 20A circuits *if there are 2 or more sockets* because 15A devices are internally rated for 20A pass\\-through. *Not 30A*.  \n\n30A receptacles belong on 30A circuits. That is it, no crossovers, no exceptions.\n\nThat receptacle you're familiar with that you've seen everywhere, has *2* sockets for purpose of the above.\n\nYou will need to change each receptacle and spur on that circuit to a 30A receptacle. You may use a NEMA TT30, NEMA 6\\-30 or NEMA 14\\-30\\.\n\n\"I don't want to do that, though!\"\n\nWire is always allowed to be larger\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnytime Code requires wire be a particular size, you are always allowed to use a larger size. There is no penalty for this, except the practical difficulty of fitting the larger wire to terminals.\n\nThe exception is that if conductors are enlarged, grounds must be enlarged in proportion, but that works fine with \\#10\\.\n\nWhat this means is you're in perfectly good standing to have \\#10 wire in a 20A or 15A circuit.\n\nEnlarging wires is often done to compensate for *voltage drop* on a long cable run, or because old wiring (e.g. from a decommissioned electric dryer or range) is being re\\-purposed for new circuits.\n\nThe circuit size is the smallest wire size in it.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn residential, where the Tap Rules are generally unavailable, the circuit size is defined by the smallest (in\\-wall) wires in it. If a circuit has a mix of \\#10, \\#12 and \\#14 wire, it must be a 15A circuit.\n\nIf a circuit has a mix of \\#12 and \\#10 wire, it must be a 20A circuit (15A is acceptable).\n\nIt can only be a 30A circuit if every single wire in the walls is 30A (\\#10 copper).\n\nGenerally anything with \\#10, \\#14 and \\#12 is defined by NEC 240\\.4\\. It cuts out some *really weird* exceptions for certain motor and welder loads, but this is generally not something you'll encounter on receptacle and light wiring.\n\n*Multi\\-Wire Branch Circuits* are a thing\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAKA shared\\-neutral or \"Edison\" circuits (for whom we have to 'thank'). These are \\+110V and \\-110V (at least in Edison's day) with neutral in the middle. Only 3 wires are needed \\+ ground, but it has the performance of 2 circuits. The neutral handles only differential current.\n\nThese must be phased correctly to avoid overloading neutral \\- the 2 phases must be 240V apart, not 0V apart. They cannot land on a tandem. To protect maintainers, they must have \"handle ties\" or be a 2\\-pole breaker.\n\nThe difference is that handle\\-ties do not provide *common trip* and most 2\\-pole breakers do. However **MWBCs do not require common trip** if they serve only 120V loads. (yeah, they can serve 240V loads *also*, and then, they need common trip).\n\nMWBCs also require that neutral be *pigtailed* and do not use the device itself for splicing neutral. Neutral must remain continuous even if the device is removed.\n\nCleaning it up\n--------------\n\nThe only mistake you have described is lack of handle ties on a MWBC. That's a common error, I'm not going to judge the electrician incompetent over that. Hopefully they are on opposite poles (240V between them).\n\n> Everything I've read tells me that, as far as the math goes, that's okay because the neutral is still only handling 30 amps, which 10 AWG can handle.\n\nYou didn't read that in NEC/CEC. You might get away with it on the \\#10, but what about the \\#12 or \\#14 beyond the \\#10? You haven't fully mapped the circuit and don't know what all the wire sizes are.\n\nIf you have mapped the whole circuit and found nothing smaller than \\#12, then you can use 20A as long as there are 2 sockets on each leg (or the 1 socket is 20A). If you have 15A on *one* leg but the other is all 20A wire, then you can use a 15A and 20A breaker with a handle tie. I have one of those!\n\n> I'm worried that the breakpoint is too high and and that I should be using two 15 amp breakers with a common trip.\n\nCorrect, that is the problem, but common trip is not required for MWBC."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An electrician has wired a Multi-Wire Branch Circuit (MWBC) in a residential setting using #10 wire throughout.

Search the Dash for *Startup Disk Creator* and click the Startup Disk Creator icon to open the **Make Startup Disk** window.\n\nThe USB flash drive that you use with Startup Disk Creator should be 2GB or larger, and for Ubuntu 18\\.04 and later it should be 4GB or larger. Startup Disk Creator will automatically format your USB flash drive to FAT32 and make it bootable. If you have only one USB flash drive plugged in to your computer, Startup Disk Creator will select it automatically. Be **very careful** to select the USB flash drive in the Make Startup Disk window in order to avoid overwriting the partition which Ubuntu is installed on, which may make Ubuntu unbootable. In the screenshot below you can see how the USB flash drive Device is identified by its model name, the same model name that appears under the **Drive** heading after *Model:* in the Disks (disk utility) application.\n\n[![Startup Disk Creator](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuFmd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuFmd.png)  \n\n**Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 16\\.04**\n\nYou can also move the *Stored in reserved extra space* slider back and forth to create some reserved extra space for persistent file storage across reboots. In Ubuntu 16\\.04 and later Startup Disk Creator no longer has the persistent file storage option.\n\n### How to make an Ubuntu Minimal USB using dd\n\nWhile the minimal iso image is handy, it isn't useful for installing on UEFI\\-based systems that you want to run in UEFI mode. The mini iso lacks the proper files for booting the computer in UEFI mode. Thus the computer will boot in BIOS compatibility mode, and the installation will be in BIOS mode.\n\n1. Download the Ubuntu Mini CD iso file for Ubuntu 18\\.04 or Ubuntu 20\\.04 from these links:\n\n\t* Ubuntu 20\\.04: [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer\\-amd64/current/legacy\\-images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/mini.iso)\n\t* Ubuntu 18\\.04: [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer\\-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso)Download the Ubuntu Mini CD iso file for Ubuntu 20\\.04 from [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer\\-amd64/current/legacy\\-images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/mini.iso). Download the file called mini.iso to your Downloads folder. You can download the mini.iso file to wherever on your computer that you want, but download it to your Downloads folder so that you can easily run the commands in the following steps without changing anything.\n2. Verify the md5 checksum of the Ubuntu mini CD iso file that you downloaded by running these commands:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads/\nmd5sum 'mini.iso'\n\n```\n\nIf you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux download the Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier tool from the official Microsoft Download Center. The Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier tool is a command line utility that computes MD5 or SHA1 cryptographic hashes for files.\n3. Check that the results of the command match the MD5 checksum of the mini.iso file on the [Ubuntu Documentation Installation Minimal CD](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) webpage.\n4. Get a USB flash drive, 1GB or larger. Delete all the files from the USB flash drive. Mount the flash drive using the *Disks* disk utility.\n5. Check in the *Disks* disk utility to find out the device name of your USB flash drive. This is **very important** because if you use the wrong device name in step 6, you will overwrite your whole operating system instead of writing to the USB flash drive. So check the USB flash drive device name twice. It should be something like `/dev/sd*` where instead of the \\* character there is a lower case letter like a, b, c, etc. In the following step I am assuming that the device name is `/dev/sdc`, but the device name of your USB drive could be something else like `/dev/sda` or `/dev/sdb` so check the device name of your USB drive twice and make sure that you get it right in step 6!\n6. Open the terminal or Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 and run the following commands:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads/  \nsudo -i  \ndd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096  ## make sure that the device name of your USB drive is correct!\n\n```\n\nThe `dd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096` command should take only a few seconds to complete on most computers because the mini.iso is a small file, less than 60MB. The result of running this command will be a bootable Ubuntu mini USB.\n7. Boot the computer from the Ubuntu mini live USB. The Ubuntu mini live USB should boot successfully and show a menu screen.\n8. If you select the Install option (the complete install, not the cli install) from the menu screen in Step 7, then you can select other options during the Ubuntu installation process to download all the packages that you need to perform a complete Ubuntu installation. Select the *Ubuntu desktop* package collection from the list of predefined collections of software in the Software selection screen in the Ubuntu mini CD installer. When you restart the system at the end of the installation, you will have a working Ubuntu desktop with the default desktop environment.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDcz0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDcz0.png)\n\n### How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X/macOS\n\n* [How do I get my Mac to boot from an Ubuntu USB key?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/28495/how-do-i-get-my-mac-to-boot-from-an-ubuntu-usb-key/655232#655232)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive on different operating systems.

Let's assume your `TeX` file is named `test.tex`. Then you should have ran `bibtex test`. Check that it did not print any error messages.\n\nTo further pin down your problem you should add `\\nocite{*}` to your `TeX` file. (I always put it right before `\\bibliography`.) This makes `bibtex` print all entries in your bibliography, even those which are not explicitly cited in the document.\n\nSo this is still about [https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/61301/creating\\-a\\-reference\\-with\\-bibtex\\-beginner](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/61301/creating-a-reference-with-bibtex-beginner).

Note that for compiling you need to do\n\n```\npdflatex first_try.tex\nbibtex first_try\npdflatex first_try.tex\npdflatex first_try.tex\n\n```\n\nIn the first run, `pdflatex` creates the `first_try.aux` file which contains the information about used bibliographies. With that given, `bibtex` can construct the `first_try.bbl` file with the assembled bibliography data. Then `pdflatex` will include it in the document.

Which of the following best explains this situation and suggests a likely cause?\n\nA) The server is experiencing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and these log entries show successful blocks of the attack.\n\nB) The firewall (UFW) is malfunctioning and randomly blocking legitimate traffic to the server.\n\nC) The server has a security tool like fail2ban or denyhosts installed, which is dynamically blocking IP addresses based on suspicious activity.\n\nD) These are normal connection attempts to common ports, and the firewall is unnecessarily strict in its default configuration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The log entries show UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) blocking various incoming connection attempts to different ports from multiple IP addresses. This pattern suggests that a security tool like fail2ban or denyhosts is likely installed on the system. These tools monitor for suspicious activity (such as repeated failed login attempts) and dynamically add rules to the firewall to block the offending IP addresses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while these could be part of an attack, the varied nature of the connection attempts and the mention of UFW suggests a more systematic blocking mechanism rather than a response to a specific DDoS attack.\n\nOption B is unlikely because the firewall appears to be functioning as intended, blocking specific incoming connections rather than malfunctioning.\n\nOption D is incorrect because many of these connection attempts are to potentially vulnerable ports (like 23 for Telnet) and are coming from varied global IP addresses, which is more indicative of potential attacks rather than normal traffic."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/02/18", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/1003461", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/143364/"], "docs_id": 1003461, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It appears that in order to install Remote Desktop Services on an Azure Windows 2019 Server VM, the VM must be [joined to a domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/join-windows-vm).

Both ends of the call are both server (inbound connections) and client (outbound connections). \nUsually, a dynamic high numbered port is used for the voice channel. A clients control channel is used to pass the voice connection IP and port opened by the client to the opposing call client within the control channel payload. Each client then initiates a voice channel (RTP mentioned above), resulting in one voice channel each way. In your case the home office client would pass the local IP (192\\.168\\.2\\.41\\), not the virtual IP (192\\.168\\.178\\.128\\) of the far end of the VPN. This results in the main office client attempting to connect to an unroutable IP rather than the virtual IP.\n\nYour remote VPN softclient must be able to pass a routable IP to the office client for the voice channel connection or you need a firewall capable of SIP session inspection and management (aka a SIP gateway). \n\nSome softclients can do a reverse cone connection (remote client initiates all call paths) to mitigate virtual IPs and NAT on a VPN. You can look for that function in your soft client docs. Otherwise, the local IPs of both VoIP clients must be transparently and directly routable by both clients. \n\nIf you have a STUN server running, enabling STUN on the client will give the client a way to lookup its virtual IP on the office end of the VPN and use that IP for registration and SIP sessions. Both server and home client must be enabled to work. Note, the STUN service must be running on a server that is directly routable by the PBX (no NAT). Usually this is the same server as the SIP registrar and catalog services. \n\nQ: does the same behavior occur between clients on the same subnet?

They are experiencing issues with voice calls not connecting properly. Which of the following is the most likely cause and solution for this problem?\n\nA) The VoIP clients are using incompatible codecs. The solution is to standardize the codec used across all clients.\n\nB) The remote VPN client is passing its local IP address (192.168.2.41) instead of its virtual IP (192.168.178.128) for the voice channel connection. The solution is to configure the VPN client to pass a routable IP or implement a SIP gateway.\n\nC) The voice channels are being blocked by the company's firewall. The solution is to open the necessary ports on the firewall for VoIP traffic.\n\nD) The VoIP system lacks proper QoS (Quality of Service) settings. The solution is to implement QoS policies on the network to prioritize VoIP traffic.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The issue described in the scenario is typical of VPN setups where the remote client passes its local, non-routable IP address for the voice channel connection. This causes the main office client to attempt to connect to an unreachable IP address. The correct solution is to either configure the VPN client to pass a routable IP address, implement a SIP gateway capable of SIP session inspection and management, or use a reverse cone connection if supported by the softclient.

In my application I will always be dealing with less than 100 data points and so is it a bad idea to use the generalized pareto distribution?\n\nHere is an example of code doing what I am trying to explain:\n\n```\n# log-likelihood\nlikelihood <- function(x, xi, sigma){\n\n  llik <- -log(sigma) - (1 / xi + 1) * log(1 + xi * x / sigma)\n  lik  <- sum(llik)\n\n  return(lik)\n}\n\n# log(prior)\nprior <- function(xi, sigma){\n\n  prior1 <- dgamma(xi, .01, .01, log = TRUE)\n  prior2 <- dgamma(sigma, .01, .01, log = TRUE)\n  prior <- (prior1 + prior2)\n\n  return(prior)\n}\n\n# log(posterior)\nposterior <- function(x, xi, sigma){\n\n  post <- likelihood(x, xi, sigma) + prior(xi, sigma)\n\n  return(post)\n}\n\n##############################################################\n### Function to simulate data from GPD\n##############################################################\n\ngpd <- function(n, mu, sigma, xi){\n\n  u <- runif(n)\n  x = mu + sigma * (u^-xi - 1) / xi\n\n  return(x)\n}\n\nset.seed(4)\nN = 1000 # Number of data points\nx = gpd(N, 0, 1.2, .8)  # Here mu = 0, sigma = 1.2, and xi = 0.8\n\nS <- 10000\nxi <- rep(NA, S)\nsigma <- rep(NA, S)\nxi[1] <- 1\nsigma[1] <- 1\n\nfor(i in 2:S){\n\n  # MCMC for xi\n  xi.star = xi[i-1] + rnorm(1,0)\n\n  if(xi.star < 0){\n    alpha = 0\n  }else{\n    ratio <- exp(posterior(x, xi.star, sigma[i-1]) - posterior(x, xi[i-1], sigma[i-1]))\n    alpha <- min(1, ratio)\n  }\n\n  if(runif(1) < alpha){\n    xi[i] <- xi.star\n  }else{\n    xi[i] <- xi[i - 1]\n  }\n\n  # MCMC for sigma\n  sigma.star = xi[i-1] + rnorm(1,0)\n\n  if(sigma.star < 0){\n    alpha = 0\n  }else{\n    ratio <- exp(posterior(x, xi[i-1], sigma.star) - posterior(x, xi[i-1], sigma[i-1]))\n    alpha <- min(1, ratio)\n  }\n\n  if(runif(1) < alpha){\n    sigma[i] <- sigma.star\n  }else{\n    sigma[i] <- sigma[i - 1]\n  }  \n}\n\nsigma <- sigma[5000:S]\nxi <- xi[5000:S]\n\nmean(sigma)\nmean(xi)\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's good to have more data , always :) However, consider why we have EVT: to work with less data! Why would you need EVT if you could collect infinite amount of data? You'd simply fit the underlying distribution and calculate any metrics on it. Because only a fraction of data goes to tails, we'd need to collect enormous amount of data before we get something going in the tails. That's where EVT comes handy: it focuses on the tails. So it allows us to study tails with much smaller data sets than otherwise would be required"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and estimating parameters for a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD), which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) EVT requires large datasets (1000+ data points) to produce reliable parameter estimates for GPD.\n\nB) EVT is primarily useful when you have access to very large datasets, as it allows for precise modeling of entire distributions.\n\nC) EVT is particularly valuable when working with limited data, as it focuses on modeling the tails of distributions effectively.\n\nD) The accuracy of GPD parameter estimates is generally consistent regardless of sample size, making EVT equally effective for both small and large datasets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key insight from the StackExchange post is that Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is especially useful when working with limited data. While more data is generally beneficial, EVT's strength lies in its ability to model the tails of distributions effectively even with smaller datasets. This is because EVT focuses specifically on extreme values, allowing for meaningful analysis of tail behavior without requiring the enormous amounts of data that would be necessary to fully characterize the entire underlying distribution. The post emphasizes that if we could collect infinite amounts of data, we wouldn't need EVT \u2013 we could simply fit the full underlying distribution. EVT's value comes from its ability to extract meaningful information about extremes from limited data, making it particularly suited for situations where collecting vast amounts of data is impractical or impossible."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/26", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/266829", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/126861/"], "docs_id": 266829, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I die a lot because I don't trust my wands to be more helpful in clearing multiple monsters that surround me (magic traps and Rodney/summon nasties), and the useful ones are all beams and rays. I've recently learned that breaking a wand acts like a grenade instead of a gun. Also, you need to be resistant to the wand's effect. What I wonder is this, \"If I break wand, does a \\+1 charge have the same effect as a \\+10 wand of the same type?\" Physics would suggest that the energy stored would make the higher charge more powerful, but gameplay suggests that breaking is breaking, nothing more... Please clarify. Also, I know that \\+0 charge usually does nothing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on both number of charges and type of wand. The [3\\.4\\.3 spoiler on breaking wands](http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/wan2-343.html) has details; the short form is, most wands do from 1 to (charges \\* 4\\) damage, with some wands doing nothing, wands of cold or fire doing twice that, and lightning or death doing four times that.

Regardless of the temp in my home, the blower motor runs non\\-stop.\nIn the winter this must have been causing my home to got through a permanent heat/cool cycle as the blower would bring cool air in after the home was at the right temp. Then the temp would get low, the furnace would kick in to heat the home and on and on.\n\nIn the summer now it seems to be doing the same thing but with the A/C. Once the home is cool enough, the blower keeps bringing in outside air with the A/C off now. This causes the home to heat up and on and on. The adverse effect at night is it's making my home too cold since the outside air is already quite cool. \n\nI check this question. \n[Why won't my furnace turn off?](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/10333/why-wont-my-furnace-turn-off)\n\nI can manually turn off the limit switch and the blower stops. \n\nHow can I test whether the problem is the limit switch or the thermostat? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the high limit switch was bad, the furnace should not fire. When the high limit switch trips, the flame/heating element will be shut off and the blower will continue to run to clear the heat. The blower will continue to run until either the system is reset, or the limit switch closes.\n\nI believe high limit switches are normally closed, and they should always fail open. Which means when they go bad, or the temperature gets too high they open the circuit. To test a limit switch, you'll want to check continuity to determine what state the switch is in.\n\n* If there is a serviceman switch, turn it off. If not, shut the power off at the breaker panel.\n* Open the access panel and locate the high limit switch. It should be somewhere on the hot box.\n* Disconnect the wires from the switch (don't forget which goes where).\n* Using a multimeter, test for continuity between the leads on the switch.\n\n*There is an easier test to check limit switches, but it should only be performed by HVAC techs. So I will not discuss it here.*\n\nIf the circuit is open, you'll want to replace the limit switch.\n\nIf the limit switch is adjustable, make sure it is set properly according to the manufactures specifications.\n\nIf the limit switch tests OK; or you've replaced it and still have the issue, you'll want to focus on the thermostat.\n\nFrom your description, it sounds more like a problem with the thermostat. Most safety mechanisms in furnaces do not let the furnace fire if there's a fault, so if you're getting flame I would not suspect a limit switch. I would suspect either the thermostat has gone bad, or it is miswired. If the fan is always on I would suspect either the fan switch has failed closed (is always in the ON position), or the fan wire was incorrectly bonded to the voltage feed line. \n\nThermostats are basically switch boxes. They'll have one live wire \\[`R`] (usually 24v in the US, or line voltage in other parts of the world), one heat call wire \\[`W`], one blower fan call wire \\[`G`], and optionally a cool call \\[`Y`], and/or [`C` wire](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/10527/33). When the thermostat wants to warm up, it will connect the `R` to `W` and `G` which tells the furnace the thermostat is cold and needs heat. If it's hot it connects the `R` to `Y` and `G`, to tell the furnace it's hot and wants to be cooled down. If you have a `FAN` control and you turn it to `ON`, the thermostat connects `R` to `G` and the blower fan turns on.\n\nThe easiest way to rule out the thermostat, is to replace it. Troubleshooting thermostats is a pain in the ass, so it's much easier to simply switch it out.\n\nIf you've changed the thermostat and you're still having the problem, call an HVAC tech."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is experiencing issues with their HVAC system where the blower motor runs non-stop regardless of the temperature.

My question is a little different.\n\nWhile writing verilog code (since I am writing it to be synthesized on an FPGA), I always try to visualize what the synthesized circuit is going to look like, and that is where the problem begins : \n\n1\\) I am not able to understand how the changing from blocking to non\\-blocking assignments would alter my synthesized circuit. For example : \n\n```\n    always @* begin\n\n        number_of_incoming_data_bytes_next <= number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg;\n        generate_input_fifo_push_pulse_next <= generate_input_fifo_push_pulse;\n\n        if(state_reg == idle) begin\n            // mealey outputs\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n\n            if((rx_done_tick) && (rx_data_out == START_BYTE)) begin\n                state_next = read_incoming_data_length;\n                end else begin\n                    state_next = idle;\n                end\n\n        end else if(state_reg == read_incoming_data_length) begin\n            // mealey outputs\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n\n            if(rx_done_tick) begin\n                number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg <= rx_data_out;\n                state_next = reading;\n            end else begin\n                state_next = read_incoming_data_length;\n            end\n\n        end else if(state_reg == reading) begin\n\n            if(count_reg == number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg) begin\n                state_next = idle;\n                // do something to indicate that all the reading is done\n                // and to send all the data in the fifo\n            end else begin\n                if(rx_done_tick) begin\n                    generate_input_fifo_push_pulse_next = ~ generate_input_fifo_push_pulse;\n                    count_next = count_reg + 1;\n                end else begin\n                    count_next = count_reg;\n                end\n            end\n\n        end else begin\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n            state_next = idle;\n        end\n    end\n\n```\n\nIn the above code, how would the synthesized circuit change if I replaced all the blocking assignments by non\\-blocking \n\n2\\) Understanding the difference between blocking and non\\-blocking statements when written sequentially is a bit simpler (and most answers to this question focus on this part), but how do blocking assignments affect behaviours when they are declared in separate conditional behaviours. For example :\n\nWould it make a difference if I wrote this:\n\n```\nif(rx_done_tick) begin\n    a = 10;\nend else begin\n    a = 8;\nend\n\n```\n\nor if I wrote this : \n\n```\nif(rx_done_tick) begin\n    a <= 10;\nend else begin\n    a <= 8;\nend\n\n```\n\nI know that conditional statements synthesize to become multiplexers or priority structures, and so I feel that using either blocking or non\\-blocking statements should not make a difference, but I am not sure.\n\n3\\) When writing testbenches, I the result of the simulation is very different when using blocking v/s non\\-blocking statements.\nThe behaviour is very different if I write : \n\n```\ninitial begin\n    #31 rx_data_out = 255;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out = 3;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out = 10;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\nend\n\n```\n\nversus when I write this : \n\n```\ninitial begin\n    #31 rx_data_out <= 255;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out <= 3;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out <= 10;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\nend\n\n```\n\nThis is very confusing. In my practice, the rx\\_done\\_tick signal is going to be generated by a Flip Flop. So, I think that non\\-blocking statements should be used to represent this behaviour. Am I right ?\n\n4\\) Finally, when to use blocking assignments and when not to use non\\-blocking statements ? I.e is it true that blocking statements should be used only in combinational behaviours , and non\\-blocking statements in sequential behaviours only? If yes or No, why ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The blocking vs non blocking assignment is a crucial concept and you have difficulty to implement them correctly because you have not understood the conceptual difference. \n\nI have attached a slide of MIT OCV PowerPoint lecture, 2005, that clearly describe the difference between the two\n\n[![Blocking vs non blocking assignment](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrgHa.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrgHa.png)\n\nYou must understand the concept of RHL (Right Hand Side) calculation. Verilog always calculates the RHS and puts it into LHS. In blocking, the assignment happens exactly after the calculation is done, while in non\\-blocking, the assignment of RHS to LHS happens when the end of block is reached.

On the left side in yellow, the wire has a very low resistance, that we will consider to be zero. But on the right hand side in green, the resistance is much higher, for example 10,000 ohms per meter. There is a current of 0\\.1 A, so in this example the voltage across the resistive part of the wire is 1000 V per meter of wire. The $E$\\-field inside the resistive part of the wire is therefore 1000 V/m.\n\nNo let's do some textbook application of Gauss Law, which states that the surface integral of the electric field, over any closed surface, is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity constant. On the left, inside the zero\\-resistance wire, the electric field in the wire is of course zero, because the resistance of the wire is zero, so there is no voltage drop along the wire. As sketched, we take a cylindrical Gaussian surface, just inside the surface of the wire. The electric field is zero everywhere on the Gaussian surface, so the surface integral is zero, and thus there is no enclosed charge. Yes. Everything ship\\-shape here, noting the well\\-known fact that there is zero net charge inside of a conductor, and that any excess charge resides on the surface, just outside of our Gaussian surface.\n\nNow consider a similar cylindrical Gaussian surface on the right, inside the green resistive wire. The electric field inside the wire here has the value $E$, in this case 1000 V/m. So the product of the electric field and the area is (AE) on each end of the cylinder. However, the electric flux is entering on one end, and leaving at the other end, so the sum of the flux is still zero, telling us there is zero enclosed charge. Gauss wins again.\n\nNow consider the Gaussian cylindrical surface in the center. On the LH end of the cylinder, the flux is zero, because the electric field here is zero. But on the RH end the flux is (EA), the non\\-zero electric field strength of 1000 V/m, multiplied by the cross sectional area of the wire. Hmmm. This tells us that there must be charge enclosed inside the wire, inside of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. But it is well know and accepted that there is no charge inside of a conductor, and so we have an apparent paradox, a violation of the Gauss Law.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I know what is happening, but it is such a cute problem that I would not wish to deprive others the opportunity to think about it.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtqHU.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtqHU.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can see, there is nothing wrong here: Since the properties of the material change where the green and the yellow parts meet, you do not have a single conductor but two different ones with a boundary between them. Gauss's law correctly states that there will be a surface charge on that boundary, which is responsible for the discontinuity of the electric field. In particular, as aekmr and J.G. explain in the comments, in a plane where a discontinuous change in the conductivity $\\\\sigma(\\\\vec r)$ occurs and through which the (homogeneous) current density $\\\\vec j$ flows, the electric field will change (also discontinouosly) so that $\\\\sigma(\\\\vec r) \\\\vec E(\\\\vec r) \\= \\\\vec j$ remains constant for all $\\\\vec r$.\n\n**Remark:**\n\nThe formula $\\\\sigma \\\\vec E \\= \\\\vec j$ is simply Ohm's law, formulated locally.

At the boundary between the low-resistance (yellow) and high-resistance (green) sections, there is a discontinuity in the electric field. In the yellow section, the electric field is essentially zero due to negligible resistance, while in the green section, there is a significant electric field (1000 V/m in this example) due to the high resistance.\n\nThis discontinuity in the electric field is accompanied by a surface charge accumulation at the boundary. This surface charge is necessary to satisfy Gauss's law, which states that the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.\n\nThe surface charge at the boundary ensures that Ohm's law (j = \u03c3E) is satisfied on both sides of the boundary, with the current density (j) remaining constant while the conductivity (\u03c3) and electric field (E) change abruptly.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the necessary surface charge. Option D is incorrect because the current density remains constant throughout the wire, as required by the continuity equation in steady-state conditions."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/18", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/629561", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/52380/"], "docs_id": 629561, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using a virtual machine with OpenWRT for routing, on a Linux machine (Slackware).

This method treats the RAM as a delay line, which matches the behavior of a traditional shift register. Bits are written sequentially to addresses 0 through 1023 as they are received.

If the Hausdorff dimension of $q\\_c$ is $h$, can one assume that the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of $q\\_t: z \\\\mapsto z^2 \\+ \\\\gamma(t)$ tends to $h$ as $t$ tends to $1$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials has been well\\-studied, although some questions still remain. \n\nYou specifically asked about parameters $c$ that do not belong to the Mandelbrot set. In this case, the map $q\\_c(z) \\= z^2 \\+ c$ has a totally disconnected Julia set. Here is what can be said.\n\n1\\) The Hausdorff dimension is always strictly greater than zero. (This is true for all non\\-linear, non\\-constant rational functions, even for meromorphic functions, as proved by Stallard. See e.g. Corollary 2\\.11 in my paper \"Hyperbolic dimension and radial Julia sets of transcendental functions\", Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 137 (2009\\), 1411\\-1420\\.)\n\n2\\) As $c$ tends to infinity, the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set tends to zero. This is because the Julia set can be written as the limit set of a conformal iterated function system with two maps, corresponding to the inverse branches of the maps, and these are strongly contracting if $c$ is large.\n\n3\\) As Alex mentions, Hausdorff dimension does not vary continuously for parameters on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. In fact, the following is true:\n\n**Theorem.** Suppose that $c\\\\in \\\\partial M$. Then there is a sequence $(c\\_n)$ of parameters outside the Mandelbrot set such that $\\\\dim(J(q\\_{c\\_n}))\\\\to 2$. \n\nThis follows from Shishikura's famous proof that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has Hausdorff dimension equal to $2$ (\"The Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets\", Ann. of Math. 147 (1998\\), no. 2, 225\u2013267\\). Indeed, he shows that there is a dense set of parameters on the boundary where the *hyperbolic dimension* equals two. Any nearby parameter will have a Julia set of Hausdorff dimension close to $2$.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many parameters on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set where the Hausdorff dimension is strictly less than $2$. So it is not hard to see that the dimension does not depend continuously in the way that you desire.\n\nIf we ask about *radial* limits (i.e., consider the conformal map that takes the complement of the closed unit disk to the complement of the Mandelbrot set, and approach the boundary of the Mandelbrot set along the image of a straight ray), things become more subtle, and I am not sure what exactly is known. However, from what I can remember, it is known that, even for the simple case where $c(t) \\= 1/4\\+t$, $t\\>0$, the Hausdorff dimension of $J(q\\_{c(t)})$ does not tend to that of $J(q\\_{1/4})$ as $t\\\\to 0$.

But I want globular, hyperspherical random data. Unimodal data. Preferably from not bounded distribution, if possible. And with an option to vary the amount of flat kurtosis.\n\n**Can you suggest** a distribution or a trick to generate?\n\nP.S.

That is, I imply 2D case to be just particular case; I'm interested in it as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Although this is obviously related to my previous answer, I think it's different enough to be considered separately. Given a point in an $n$\\-dimensional cloud of iid standard normals, shrink it radially a chosen proportion of the way to the corresponding fractile of a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball.\n\nFor iid standard normals in $n$ dimensions, the distance from the origin has a $\\\\chi\\_n$ distribution. Let $F\\_n(d)$ denote its cdf. For a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball, the cdf of the distance from the origin is $d^n$, and the inverse cdf is $p^{1/n}$. So multiply each point's coordinate vector by $1 \\+ \\\\alpha(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}/d \\- 1\\)$, where $\\\\alpha$ is the chosen proportion and $d$ is the observed distance of the point from the origin.\n\nEDIT \\-\\- A minor improvement, that makes the results easier to interpret: Scale the ball so that the mean square distance of the points from the origin is the same as the normal, $n$. The corresponding multiplier on the vector of normals is $1 \\+ \\\\alpha\\\\,(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}\\\\sqrt{n\\+2}\\\\,/d \\- 1\\)$.\n\nI have no proof that the marginal distribution is unimodal, but I have looked at histograms of marginal distributions with $\\\\alpha \\= 0, .05, \\\\ldots, 1$ for $n \\= 1, \\\\ldots, 10$, and they all look as they should, varying smoothly from $\\\\mathrm{N}(0,1\\)$ to a shifted and scaled $\\\\mathrm{Beta}(\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2},\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2})$. For $n \\= 2$ I have also looked at scatter plots with the same set of $\\\\alpha$\\-values, and they too look as they should, with no \"bald spot\" in the middle.\n\nHere is Mathematica code whose results are organized to facilitate exploring the effect of $\\\\alpha$.\n\n```\n{m, n} = { sample size, # of dimensions };\nz = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {m, n}];\ny = z * With[{dd = Total[z^2, {2}]},\n    CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n], dd]^(1/n) * Sqrt[(n + 2)/dd]];\n\n```\n\nThen `x = alpha*y + (1-alpha)*z` will be a matrix that varies smoothly with `alpha` between iid normal (`alpha = 0`; pure `z`) and a uniform n\\-ball (`alpha = 1`; pure `y`). Here are scatter plots of 5000 points in 2 dimensions for `alpha = {0, .25, .50, .75, 1}`.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VSOTd.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist wants to generate a multivariate continuous dataset that is globular like a multivariate standard normal distribution, but more platykurtic.

It is not a replacement for a database, but it makes a good addition to add functionality, specifically advanced text searching, along side your existing database.\n\nI see where you can get them confused. They can actually fit the same need, but not always. ElasticSearch does exactly what it sounds like, *searches*. A graph database doesn't specify relations or indexes, where as ElasticSearch does. So fundamentally they work quite differently. ElasticSearch *analyzes* documents with, for example, English analyzer. What this does it will take words and analyze different variations of that word or even synonyms. For example, `dig`, would be anaylzed as `dig,digs,dug,digging,digger ...`. When you run a query on elasticsearch your queries can also be analyzed, then those words are queried for and can be *scored* by relevance.\n\nElasticSearch is a great tool, because it's really flexible. You can find a wide range of relative content, or you can find a needle in the hay stack, and its relatively easy.\n\nGraph Databases have their advantage too. Finding relevance/relations between things like hash tags for example, or things with many mutable relations. They're great and interesting pieces of technology, however I'd have to say that its not as powerful as ElasticSearch. Mostly because ElasticSearch is geared towards this sort of thing, and it handles analysis for you so you can do full\\-text search. However if you're looking to use a system more so like twitter's search that's based on predefined tagging/keywords, then you'd be better off using the Graph Database your already using.\n\nThe question is how robust do you want your searching to be? If you have a need to do really fine grain(full text) searches I'd use elasticsearch. Otherwise you can always implement a search relatively easily on a graph database. Once you have search implemented its not impossible to migrate to elasticsearch if you find yourself later needing a more robust search engine, just implement your search with that in mind."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A social networking startup is considering adding advanced search functionality to their platform, which currently uses Neo4j as its primary database.

ElasticSearch excels at advanced text searching, analysis, and providing relevance-scored results, which are not core strengths of graph databases like Neo4j. While Neo4j does offer some full-text search capabilities through Lucene, ElasticSearch provides more advanced features in this area.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ElasticSearch is not designed to replace a graph database like Neo4j.

Traditional boosting algorithms typically re-adjust weights of training instances, focusing subsequent models on difficult-to-classify samples. In contrast, gradient tree boosting, as proposed by Friedman (2001), optimizes the tree's output directly.\n\nIn gradient tree boosting, instead of adjusting instance weights, the algorithm optimizes the output of each tree node (b_jm). This is done by fitting the tree to pseudo-residuals and then optimizing its output, which is more efficient than separately optimizing the tree structure and its weight in the ensemble.\n\nOption A is incorrect because both methods use weak learners. Option C is incorrect because both can use learning rates, and gradient boosting actually introduced the concept of a shrinkage parameter (learning rate) to prevent overfitting. Option D is incorrect because both can use regression or classification trees depending on the problem.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the fundamental differences between traditional boosting and gradient boosting approaches, particularly in how they iteratively improve their models."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/06/05", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/643413", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/295588/"], "docs_id": 643413, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We can make a steam engine just by putting huge amount of water in large tank and heat it and then use the steam to run the wheel.

We just have to put huge amount of water and heat then engine will work for days. But in my books, all engines are based on cyclic process. Why?\n\nThis is essentially a question of definition. You can indeed extract work from a non\\-cyclical thermodynamic process, but such processes are not considered to be heat engines. Heat engines are defined by returning to the initial state with the exception of a transfer of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. If a device truly does not have a cycle then it is not a heat engine by definition.\n\nSo the real question is not whether all heat engines are based on a cycle, they are by definition. The real question is whether or not your example qualifies as a heat engine.\n\nYour example is a standard steam turbine which is based on the Rankine cycle: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle>\n\n![Rankine cycle from Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Rankine_cycle_layout.png/640px-Rankine_cycle_layout.png)\n\nAt some point you will need to refill the water. So the complete cycle includes condensing the water from steam back to a liquid. It doesn\u2019t matter if that condensation is done in a closed chamber or in the open atmosphere. Either way the condensation and refilling is considered part of the cycle. So your device does have a cycle (the Rankine cycle) and is indeed a heat engine (a steam turbine).\n\nRegarding efficiency: if you replenish the water then you have a legitimate heat engine with a cycle and the efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this proposal?\n\nA) The student's design is a novel non-cyclic heat engine that could potentially exceed Carnot efficiency.\n\nB) The proposed system is not a heat engine at all, as it lacks a defined thermodynamic cycle.\n\nC) The system is actually based on the Rankine cycle, with the condensation phase occurring in the atmosphere rather than in a closed chamber.\n\nD) The proposal represents a perpetual motion machine, as it can theoretically run indefinitely without additional input.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The student's proposed system is indeed a heat engine, specifically a steam turbine based on the Rankine cycle. Although the water is not recondensed within a closed system, the condensation phase still occurs in the atmosphere, completing the thermodynamic cycle. The refilling of water is considered part of this cycle. \n\nOption A is incorrect because all heat engines are cyclic by definition and cannot exceed Carnot efficiency. \n\nOption B is wrong because the system does have a defined cycle (Rankine cycle) even if it's not immediately apparent. \n\nOption D is incorrect as the system requires continuous heat input and water replenishment to operate.\n\nThe correct answer, C, recognizes that the proposed system is a standard steam turbine operating on the Rankine cycle, with the condensation phase occurring in the open atmosphere rather than in a closed chamber."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/21", "source": ["https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3343", "https://english.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/users/2637/"], "docs_id": 3343, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In [my answer here](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/91931/2637), I had an entire paragraph marked up as a \"link\", which someone edited to place the [\\[source]](http://grammar.about.com/od/fh/g/gerundterm.htm) after the quoted text.\n\nI'm certainly not complaining \\- if anything I'm already grateful that anyone would take the trouble.

I am guessing that this ensures that one of the 110/120 volt connections is active at any one time, but wouldn't this make the wiring 2\\-phase?\n\nJust to verify, the rest of the setup below:\n\nWiring diagram:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOlsG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOlsG.png)\n\nThe 18BX2203 has a 3 HP 220 volt 1 phase Leeson motor. I have residential 2 phase wiring and was confused if I needed to some each 120 from the same phase or from different phases.\n\nThe manual recommended that I connect the bandsaw to a 15 amp breaker but I wanted to provide myself some additional margin for a future tool but was also aware that tools use more power on startup. I initially was going to use 12/2 wire, but I decided on schedule 40 conduit with Thermoplastic High Heat\\-resistant Nylon\\-coated THHN wire.\n\nAnother question I had was the number of wires connecting to the outlet. I initially thought I would need to have 4 wires (a 12/3 wire), both a neutral and a ground in addition to two hot wires. After thinking about it a little bit, it made sense two use three wires total, since I was setting up a dedicated circuit and the ground and the neutral would be the same wire\n\nReceptacle\n==========\n\nThe bandsaw came pre\\-wired with a 220V 3\\-pin plug.

The center tap is called neutral. This is called \"Split\\-phase\" since you can grab the outer \"phase\" wires (hot\\-hot) or grab one phase and neutral for half the voltage.\n\nIf you're wondering, this was Edison's idea when power was DC.\n\nThe plug you need on the saw is a NEMA 6\\-15\\.

Further, a 20A circuit is allowed to have 15A sockets on it (as long as there are 2 or more sockets, e.g. the above NEMA 6\\-15 will suffice).\n\n* If you cable this with /3 cable, simply cap off the neutral.\n* If you cable it with /2 cable, you MUST use tape etc. to re\\-mark the white wire to indicate that it is a hot.\n* If you use individual THHN wires, you MUST use a hot color (black brown red orange yellow pink blue purple) for the 2nd hot.

Now this seems like a problem that should have been solved *decades* ago, and indeed \\- there's no shortage of logging libraries for any decent programming language. But while trying to choose among them I ran across a rather fundamental dilemma.\n\nDo I emphasize safety or performance?\n\nLet's look at both extremes. If I emphasize safety, then I should make sure that the log entry is safely stored before I proceed with work. Otherwise I could end up in a situation where my program thinks it's logged 5 log entries and has done substantial work, but then an error makes these entries disappear and later forensics turn up nonsensical results. \"I see that the program only logged up to point A, but there is already data stored which suggests it reached point B. Then where are the log entries between A and B?! What's going on here?!\" At the furthest extremes of safety this means that after I produce a log entry I also need to wait until it has been successfully flushed to physical storage. However that's a VERY expensive operation and would basically kill my program's performance, since every log call would probably take tens if not hundreds of milliseconds.\n\nOn the other extreme \\- performance. In this case I need to shove the log entry to wherever as fast as I can and move on without looking back. Another background process then can take said entry and try to write it to physical storage, but the main process is unaffected. The main risk here is the one mentioned before \\- it's easy to lose log entries if everything crashes and burns before they could be written out.\n\nAnd this whole thing is on a spectrum, of course. By employing various strategies you can make your chosen approach either safer (but slower) or faster (but riskier). And... I can't decide how to choose.\n\nIs there some commonly accepted middle ground? Has anyone every come up with a way of deciding where your particular situation should lie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For almost any kind of system, regardless if it is a small or a huge one, it is a good idea to follow the tactics\n\n**First make right, then make it fast!**\n----------------------------------------\n\n(and: don't optimize \"just in case\").\n\nLogging (especially when done for the purpose of post mortem analysis) usually needs to be complete and not to loose the final entries, so I would recommend heavily to always start with a solution which flushes each logged line immediately to disk. Otherwise the log could become pretty useless. \n\nNow, when you have added \"enough\" logging to your application, and when you actually experience a *real, measureable* performance hit, then (and only then) start thinking about optimizations. For most real\\-world applications, it is probably enough to have a switch for turning the logging on or off. Or, if that is not sufficient, a parameter to change the logging level (like \"minimal\", \"standard\", \"verbose\"). So one can make the decision of \"safety\" vs \"performance\" at run time.\n\nThere are definitely some systems for which is not sufficient (for example, when you observe hard\\-to\\-reproduce bugs only after some hours under production load, but cannot afford full \"debug\" logging in a production environment, or when you don't have a chance to restart the system easily in \"logging\" mode after a failure, like software for a black\\-box of an airplane). \n\nIf you are really developing such extraordinary software, you might have to think of further optimizations \\- like a background process which receives logging events and can write them buffered to disk even when the main program crashes, or whatever makes most sense for the particular kind of system you are developing. However, as always with optimizations, this has to done with in\\-depth knowledge of the requirements, the use cases and the system, there is no easy \"one\\-size\\-fits\\-all\" solution to this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is implementing logging in their application and is facing a dilemma between safety and performance. Based on the advice given, which of the following approaches is recommended as the initial strategy?\n\nA) Implement a high-performance logging system that quickly writes log entries to memory without flushing to disk\nB) Start with a logging solution that immediately flushes each logged line to disk for completeness\nC) Use a background process to handle logging asynchronously to avoid impacting the main program's performance\nD) Implement a complex buffering system that balances safety and performance from the beginning\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The advice given emphasizes the principle \"First make it right, then make it fast.\" It recommends starting with a solution that flushes each logged line immediately to disk, ensuring completeness and usefulness of logs, especially for post-mortem analysis. Only after implementing this safe approach should developers consider optimizing for performance if a real, measurable performance hit is observed. This aligns with option B, which prioritizes safety and completeness of logs over initial performance concerns.\n\nOption A prioritizes performance over safety, which goes against the initial recommendation. Option C introduces complexity that may not be necessary at first and doesn't align with the \"make it right first\" principle. Option D suggests implementing a complex system from the start, which contradicts the advice to avoid premature optimization and to start with a simple, correct solution."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/11/30", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/70174816", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/17555017/"], "docs_id": 70174816, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I change SVG image to have background color `#ff3400` and color of quotes to `#ffffff` ?\nHere is HTML:\n\n```html\n<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Capa_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"508.044px\" height=\"508.044px\" viewBox=\"0 0 508.044 508.044\" style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 508.044 508.044;\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n    <g>\n        <g>\n            <path d=\"M0.108,352.536c0,66.794,54.144,120.938,120.937,120.938c66.794,0,120.938-54.144,120.938-120.938\n            s-54.144-120.937-120.938-120.937c-13.727,0-26.867,2.393-39.168,6.61C109.093,82.118,230.814-18.543,117.979,64.303\n            C-7.138,156.17-0.026,348.84,0.114,352.371C0.114,352.426,0.108,352.475,0.108,352.536z\" />\n            <path d=\"M266.169,352.536c0,66.794,54.144,120.938,120.938,120.938s120.938-54.144,120.938-120.938S453.9,231.599,387.106,231.599\n            c-13.728,0-26.867,2.393-39.168,6.61C375.154,82.118,496.875-18.543,384.04,64.303C258.923,156.17,266.034,348.84,266.175,352.371\n            C266.175,352.426,266.169,352.475,266.169,352.536z\" />\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Styling the svg background using css works:\n\nEDIT: background is `#ff3400` using css and foreground is `#ffffff` by setting `fill` within the svg.\n\n```css\nsvg {\n  background: #ff3400;\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Capa_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"508.044px\" height=\"508.044px\" viewBox=\"0 0 508.044 508.044\" fill=\"#ffffff\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n    <g>\n        <g>\n            <path d=\"M0.108,352.536c0,66.794,54.144,120.938,120.937,120.938c66.794,0,120.938-54.144,120.938-120.938\n            s-54.144-120.937-120.938-120.937c-13.727,0-26.867,2.393-39.168,6.61C109.093,82.118,230.814-18.543,117.979,64.303\n            C-7.138,156.17-0.026,348.84,0.114,352.371C0.114,352.426,0.108,352.475,0.108,352.536z\" />\n            <path d=\"M266.169,352.536c0,66.794,54.144,120.938,120.938,120.938s120.938-54.144,120.938-120.938S453.9,231.599,387.106,231.599\n            c-13.728,0-26.867,2.393-39.168,6.61C375.154,82.118,496.875-18.543,384.04,64.303C258.923,156.17,266.034,348.84,266.175,352.371\n            C266.175,352.426,266.169,352.475,266.169,352.536z\" />\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided SVG and CSS information:\n\nQuestion: To style an SVG image with a background color of #ff3400 and change the color of the quote shapes to #ffffff, which combination of the following methods is correct?\n\nA) Add a 'style' attribute to the SVG tag with \"background: #ff3400;\" and change the 'fill' attribute of the path elements to \"#ffffff\"\n\nB) Use CSS to set \"background: #ff3400;\" for the SVG selector and add a 'fill' attribute with value \"#ffffff\" to the SVG tag\n\nC) Use CSS to set \"background: #ff3400;\" for the SVG selector and add a 'style' attribute with \"fill: #ffffff;\" to each path element\n\nD) Use CSS to set \"background: #ff3400;\" for the SVG selector and add a 'fill' attribute with value \"#ffffff\" to the SVG tag\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct approach because it combines the proper use of CSS for setting the background color of the SVG and the correct placement of the 'fill' attribute to change the color of the shapes within the SVG.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding a 'style' attribute directly to the SVG tag for background color is not the best practice, and changing individual path elements' fill is unnecessary and inefficient.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the CSS part is correct, adding a 'style' attribute to each path element is unnecessary and less efficient than setting the 'fill' attribute on the SVG tag.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's a duplicate of the correct answer (B).
