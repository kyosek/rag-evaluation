I believe this is because\nthe formula for denominator df does not permit 0 variances.\n\nComparing H vs. HS, H vs. S, and HS vs. S, with three 2\\-sample\nWelch t tests, I get P\\-values 0\\.006, 0\\.012, and 0\\.190, respectively.\n\n```\nt.test(h, hs)$p.val; t.test(h, s)$p.val;  t.test(hs,s)$p.val\n[1] 0.00567182\n[1] 0.01266049\n[1] 0.1898282\n\n```\n\nSo, taking the data to be valid, it seems that the last two groups\ndo not differ significantly, while the first differs significantly\nfrom the other two. P\\-values are small enough that it seems OK to\ntake the two significant differences at face value.\n\nFinally, I did an experiment artificially 'unrounding' the ties\nin the third group so that `oneway.test` will run.\n\n```\nh = c(60, 57.14, 42.86)\nhs = c(85.71, 88.89, 100)\ns1 = c(99.8, 99.9, 100.1, 100.2)  # 'unrounded'\nx = c(h, hs, s1)\ng = as.factor(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3))\noneway.test(x ~ g)\n\n        One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances)\n\ndata:  x and g\nF = 32.514, num df = 2.0000, denom df = 2.6686, p-value = 0.01337\n\n```\n\nThis experiment seems (a) to clarify that the zero variance was your\nproblem running `oneway.test` on your original data, and (b) to\nconfirm that there are differences among the three groups, that would\njustify the *ad hoc* t tests shown earlier."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducted an experiment to compare the effects of three treatments (H, HS, and S) on a response variable WG.

So, we decided to migrate to Git. The translation has been less than smooth though.\n\nOur site is broken up into three environments DEV, QA, and PROD. For tho most part, DEV and the source control repo have been in sync with each other. There is one branch in the repo, if a page was going to be moved up to QA then the file was moved manually, same thing with stuff that was ready for PROD. So, our current QA and PROD environments do not correspond to any particular commit in the master branch.\n\nClarification: The QA and PROD branches are not currently, nor have they ever been in source control.\n\nThe Question\n============\n\nHow do I move QA and PROD into Git? Should I forget about the history we've maintained up to this point and start over with a new repo? I could start with everything on PROD, then make a branch and pull in everything from QA, and then make another branch off of that with DEV. That way not only will the branches reflect the differences in the environments, they'll be in the right order chronologically with the newest commits in the DEV branch.\n\nWhat I've tried so far\n======================\n\nI thought about creating a QA branch off of the current master and using robocopy to make the working folder look like the current QA environment. This doesn't work because the new commit from QA will remove new files from DEV and that will remove them when we merge up, I suspect there will be similar problems if I started QA at an earlier (though not exact) commit from DEV.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a project called [Vault2Git](https://github.com/AndreyNikiforov/vault2git)(I have not tested this project myself) that can be used to convert your base repository into git.

Using Vault2Git allows the team to preserve the existing history from their SourceGear Vault repository during the migration to Git. This tool is specifically designed for this type of conversion, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nAfter the conversion, manually adding QA and PROD as separate branches allows the team to incorporate these environments into the Git workflow.

It uses the generic [python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python \"show questions tagged 'python'\") tag\n2. The answer clearly answers the question. It's accepted and decently upvoted\n3. Python is a bit weird in the 2\\.X vs 3\\.X split. There's two ways to do a lot of things.\n\nEdits **should not replace working code**, even if the methodology is obsolete. The catch here is it **removed** the 2\\.X answer for a 3\\.X answer. New answers come along all the time, but this should either\n\n1. Be a comment\n2. Be another answer\n\nBoth are valid reasons to reject this.\n\n---\n\nI'm editing this in because there's a different sub\\-issue here: the edit was valid syntax in both versions. I'll use this from MisterMiyagi's [post](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421315/19123103), since it's concise:\n\n> It is important that the change does not invalidate the previous answer scope: a single\\-argument `print` is backwards compatible to Python 2\\.\n\nThe early voting that's happening in this Meta seems to be related to that sentiment. Another [comment of his](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421310/are-edits-from-python-2s-print-to-python-3s-print-acceptable#comment932820_421315):\n\n> Yes, I expect some level of subject matter expertise from edit reviewers. Having to judge whether two versions are the technically equivalent is frequently required, not just for code changes. Knowing that `print(x)` will work in both versions of Python does not seem exceptional to me.\n\nTherein lies the problem: you can't expect that. The Suggested Edit queue is, hands down, the most clogged queue we have. There's a hard limit of 500 edits allowed to sit in there. We need reviewers, and we cannot demand that only subject matter experts (SMEs) review what they already know. That would mean you only review a handful of things. Per [the FAQ entry](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/260246/2370483)\n\n> If changing the syntax errors or typos would result in the code doing something other than what the answer says it will, consider creating a comment or a separate answer explaining your change. If posting another answer with only that change seems like it won't provide added value to future visitors, it probably doesn't change logic or functionality and should be an edit instead.\n\nThis isn't a typo, it's simply another way to express the same thing.

The book takes the height to be \"10m\" which is the height from the ground.  \n\nMy question is do we take the height from the ground or do we take net height because potential energy is relative to height isn't it? If height is relative then shouldn't the total height be 30metres? If the given answer is correct won't it mean that there is ZERO work done in bringing water from the underground no matter how deep it is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I agree with JMac's comment that the question is highly ambiguous and cannot be answered definitively. Perhaps the required context or assumptions are provided by the previous sections in the textbook.\n\nIf the water level in the well remains 20m below ground level while water is pumped out, and that of the tank at 10m above, then every litre of water is raised through a height of 30m. The same reasoning applies if the water is initially at ground level and the depth of water in the well is 20m. Judging by the answer, perhaps the key insight is that the reservoir of water below ground is so vast that the level of water in the well is not affected by removing 22380 litres. This also assumes that the rate at which water is removed is less that the rate at which it can seep back into the well through its walls and base. \n\nHowever, if the level of water in the well and/or the storage tank changes, then the calculation is not so straightforward. You can only decide if this is the case from the situation described in the question. If the situation is not described adequately in the question or its context, then there is no way of knowing what the author intended."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 15 HP motor is used to pump water from a well that is 25m deep to fill a cylindrical tank with a radius of 2m and height of 3m.

Volume of the tank:\n   V = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0 * 2^2 * 3 = 37.7 m^3 = 37,700 liters\n\n2.

Input voltage is 22\\-50V, so input current can be \\~6\\-13A. I read on Internet, that beads saturate and lose their filtering efficiency, so, it is better to use beads with current ratings 3\\-4 times higher. How can I implement such filter, as in the example in the datasheet? There are no ferrite beads with current ratings higher than 11A.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQ8nl.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQ8nl.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Identify what filtering is needed, then design a filter for it.\n\nThat filter can use ferrite beads, if the required impedance is suitable, and DC bias falls within the saturation current (for whatever saturation threshold you find acceptable).\n\nFerrite beads are poorly described, for the most part; some manufacturers do provide bias curves, usually located on their website database. Laird is the standout exception, providing bias curves for almost their entire catalog (right there in the catalog).\n\nFerrite beads are a poor choice for power filtering, as they saturate quite easily, even those with high ratings. A typical 100\u03a9 (at 100MHz) 1206 chip will saturate at 200mA or so; the situation does not improve much with size. (It does improve with low impedances: a 10\u03a9 1210 might be usable here; but that's also not adding very much impedance!)\n\nWhat is a ferrite bead, anyway \\-\\- why do we use it? It's an inductor with significant resistance. This gives good damping at RF, modest filtering at HF, and a reasonable LF (or so) bandwidth when used as a lowpass filter. This is great for signal filtering, and addressing resonances on cables for example, but not so great for power filtering purposes where we might want a lower cutoff, and need higher current capacity (without affecting the impedance).\n\nSo just use a regular old inductor, and dampen it adequately with some parallel resistance!\n\nThe main downside is the need for two components, and the single\\-pole response doesn't have as wide bandwidth \\-\\- ferrite beads generally have a \\\\$Z \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{F}\\\\$ response, meaning equal parts R and X, or Q \u2248 1, over a fairly wide range of frequencies. You don't really have to think about it, it doesn't matter too much what you're trying to filter or damp, it's almost always going to have at least a modestly well damped response. Whereas the L\u00a0\\|\\|\u00a0R network simply has inductance below cutoff, and resistance above, and that resistance is flat (constant with frequency), so it needs to be sized as a compromise between RF filtering and filter damping.\n\n---\n\nIn the given circuit, I might not worry about the ferrite beads at all, but use a few small (0\\.1\\-1uH?) inductors on the various connections for differential filtering (L3\\-L7; L4 and L6 can be removed because it would be differential mode filtering), then common mode chokes for what's left (which compensates the DC bias, so that a ferrite\\-bead\\-like characteristic can still be had).\n\nIn return, some damping is likely welcome, such as a lossy bulk capacitance. An electrolytic in parallel with C10 and C3, or something equivalent, would be fine. The capacitance needs to be much larger than the parallel equivalent ceramics (whatever is directly in parallel with it, or opposite the inductor \\-\\- so, in parallel with C9 and C10, \u226b10uF; in parallel with C3, \u226b20uF), and ESR \\= \\\\$\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L}{C}}\\\\$ where L is the inductor and C is the same parallel equivalent capacitance.\n\nBy \"something equivalent\", all that's important is the impedance; ceramics could be used, with an external ESR added, it just might be annoying having to use so many (i.e. two in parallel without ESR, plus four or more with ESR).\n\nTo be clear, we don't have to use LR damping, but can substitute RC damping instead, when the circuit is a pi filter for example. The damping also addresses power\\-on (inrush) surge and dynamic stability, so is highly recommended in general. (A TVS might also be desirable, in case the battery here is likely to be hot\\-plugged often, or subject to noise like an automotive supply, or may be reversed accidentally.)\n\nIf the total capacitance starts to get difficult for the regulator to handle, probably a compromise should be met between low\\-ESR ceramics and modest\\-ESR bulk."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A power supply designer is working on a circuit to drive a 56V 5A COB LED with an input voltage range of 22-50V. The designer wants to implement a filter similar to the one shown in the EVM datasheet schematic, but is concerned about the current ratings of ferrite beads. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for this high-current application?\n\nA) Use multiple ferrite beads in parallel to increase the current handling capability\nB) Replace the ferrite beads with regular inductors and add parallel damping resistors\nC) Increase the size of the ferrite beads to 2512 or larger package to handle higher currents\nD) Use ceramic capacitors with very low ESR to compensate for the limitations of ferrite beads\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to replace the ferrite beads with regular inductors and add parallel damping resistors. This solution addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Ferrite beads saturate easily and lose filtering efficiency at high currents, making them poor choices for power filtering in this high-current application.\n2. Regular inductors can handle higher currents without saturating.\n3. Adding parallel damping resistors helps achieve a well-damped response, which is important for filter stability and performance.\n4. This approach allows for better control of the filter characteristics and cutoff frequency.\n5. It avoids the limitations of ferrite beads, which typically don't have current ratings higher than 11A.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply paralleling ferrite beads doesn't solve the core issue of their poor performance in power filtering applications. Option C is not a viable solution as even larger package sizes don't significantly improve the saturation characteristics for this current level. Option D misses the point that the main issue is with the inductors (ferrite beads) rather than the capacitors, and doesn't address the core filtering problem."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/10", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/48611", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8423/"], "docs_id": 48611, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to devise certain rules of thumb to help solve certain computer design/architecture challenges.

One and a half years ago I posted this suggestion: [Let us merge \\[mixed], \\[mixed\\-effect] and \\[mixed\\-model] tags](https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1970) that got 25\\-1\\=24 upvotes. Nothing happened.\n\n**I am concerned by how these discussions go.** In none of these cases (!) was there a negative opinion voiced. So nobody seems to be objecting, a lot of people seem to be agreeing in the comments and via the upvotes, but no action is undertaken.\n\nAre moderators waiting for a certain number of upvotes to accumulate? I guess there are no strict rules here (?) and the required level of explicit consensus might depend on how controversial the suggestion might appear to moderators. This makes it ultimately up to a subjective judgement of moderators \\-\\- which is completely fine with me, but then it would be helpful if moderators explicitly stated their opinions in such discussions. Currently it is difficult to understand why some of the suggested tag changes are swiftly acted upon and some others get completely stuck.\n\n**More importantly, what can we do about it? How should we deal with tag moderation more effectively?**\n\n---\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. One problem I see for moderators is there's no real way to \"set a reminder\" for anything you want to act on in the future but can't (/shouldn't/etc) act on right now. \n\nVotes on meta questions that could lead to an action by a moderator are a good example of a place where it's important to be able to say something like \"Check the status of this in 72 hours (/a week/tomorrow), because I may need to act on it\". Moderators often come to these threads early (since we're notified when they post) but may not remember to check back.\n\nThis situation \\- where you recognize now that an action may be needed in the future but there won't be any 'trigger' to do anything then \\- is a problem I raised on meta.SE:\n\n[Allow moderators to leave themselves reminder notes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257565/allow-moderators-to-leave-themselves-reminder-notes)\n\n(only to have it closed as duplicate of something it's quite clearly not an actual duplicate of \\-\\- I ruled out the exact thing it later closed as a duplicate of, right in the question). It got a little support via votes, but it would have needed a lot more support to go anywhere, especially since it closed. So much for that.\n\nI don't have a good solution to this (or rather, I believe I do, as indicated above ... but I can't do anything much about it). \\[Edit: well, \"ping moderators\" in some fashion, as amoeba mentions, is of course always an option.]\n2. There's also no clear indicator of what is \"sufficient\" to indicate that we should take an action. There's no person and no set criteria which say \"yes, that vote passes, now let's add it to the tasks that someone needs to take care of\". When anyone can vote at any time, who says a vote passes? \\[Also, some of the time at least there's no clearly identified alternatives to vote for, sometimes just a single option that has a few upvotes, in which case sometimes it's not even clear we're really holding a vote rather than just discussion.]\n\nI don't have a good suggestion for how do we deal with having a time point and one or more criteria by which to be able to say \"okay, this vote's officially over, did the proposal get over the line?\"\n3. In some cases (such as some kinds of retagging operation) you don't necessarily need a moderator to do it. If its one of those \"retag a few at a time by hand\" ones, anyone with edit privilege should be able to retag them (though it would be sightly easier for those users with the higher level ability to edit just the tags). In those cases, as long as there's at least some reasonable support you can point to here, there should be *no problem whatever* just doing it.\n\nSo at least in some cases, the issues in (1\\.) and (2\\.) are moot; anyone who cares enough to do it (and who is able to) just needs to do it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the main issues with tag moderation on StackExchange, as outlined in the discussion?\n\nA) Moderators are intentionally ignoring user suggestions for tag changes.\nB) There's a lack of clear criteria for when to implement tag changes and no system for moderators to set reminders to revisit discussions.\nC) Users are not providing enough upvotes or detailed explanations for their tag change suggestions.\nD) The community is divided on most tag change proposals, leading to inaction.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer B best captures the key issues discussed in the post.

According to the documentation, the basic functionality of file transfer services like mailbigfile.com can be replicated on any web server with sufficient space and reasonable upload policies. The answer states that existing protocols such as HTTP, FTP, or SSH can be used to set up a basic file transfer service on the company's own web server. This aligns with the information provided in the top answer, which mentions that \"any web hosting service can provide access to files\" using these protocols.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation suggests that the technology behind such services isn't complex and shouldn't be very expensive, contrary to the statement about needing expensive proprietary software.\n\nOption B is false because the documentation clearly indicates that it's possible to run such a service from the company's own web server, which would be \"far less likely to be blocked\" by clients.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while web collaboration systems are mentioned as a potential solution, they are described as \"a much bigger project\" and not the only alternative to services like mailbigfile.com."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/04", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/531170", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/78625/"], "docs_id": 531170, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *I cannot provide a minimum\\-working example because of the large sizes of all files, as you'll see.*\n\nI'm writing a very large book (tufte\\-book under TeXShop 3\\.0\\), with nine included chapters and an Appendix, containing many hundreds of citations.

It follows that r\\_A(a) must be at least 1/3; for if it weren't, there would be room in between 1/3 and r\\_A(a) to insert some r which satisfies 1/3 \\> r \\> r\\_A(a), and we've just seen that's not possible.\n\nIt might help to look at the argument in a vaguer but more intuitive way (the 1/3 is a slight distraction). Suppose you could find an element a in A which had large norm but very small spectral radius. Then its image in A/I would also have very small spectral radius, hence by your assumption it would have small norm in A/I. By definition of the quotient norm, that means a is very close to I (in the sense of the distance from a point to a closed subspace) and so there exists a' \\\\in I which is very close to a. In particular, a' should have large norm (since a does) and hence have large spectral radius by the assumption on I. But now a and a' are elements of A which are very close together, yet one has very small spectral radius and the other has large spectral radius. That shouldn't be possible, since the spectral radius is dominated by the norm.\n\nMaking everything precise above, one gets essentially the original argument I gave.

Obviously, $AA^{\\-1} \\= I$, but in general this is a quadratic system in many variables, for which I am unaware of any solution procedure.\n\nEven general pointers would be most welcome. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the question suggests that the questioner is looking for an *efficient* algorithm for this problem, here is my attempt to answer the question from the complexity\\-theoretic perspective. Unfortunately, the answer is pretty negative.\n\nThe following problem, which is one of the possible formulations of the question, is NP\\-complete.\n\n*Given*: N\u2208\u2115, finitely many linear constraints (equations or inequalities) over \u211a on variables aij and bij (1\u2264i,j\u2264N), and N\u00d7N rational matrices A and B satisfying AB\\=I and all the given linear constraints.  \n\n*Question*: Is there another pair (A, B) of N\u00d7N rational matrices that satisfy AB\\=I and all the given linear constraints?\n\nA proof is by reduction from the following problem (called \u201cAnother Solution Problem (ASP) of SAT\u201d):\n\n*Given*: An instance \u03c6 of [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) and a satisfying assignment to \u03c6.  \n\n*Question*: Is there another satisfying assignment to \u03c6?\n\nThe ASP of SAT is known to be NP\\-complete \\[YS03].\n\n*Note: The following reduction is much simplified compared to the first version posted. See below for the first version, which proves a slightly stronger result.*\n\nWe can construct a reduction from the ASP of SAT to the problem in question as follows. Given an instance of SAT with n variables x1,\u2026,xn, let N\\=n and constrain A to be a diagonal matrix such that A\\=A\u22121; these are easily written as linear equality constraints on the elements of A and A\u22121. These constraints are equivalent to the condition that A is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are \u00b11\\. Now encode a truth assignment to the n variables by such a matrix by letting aii\\=1 if xi is true and aii\\=\u22121 otherwise. Now it is easy to write down the constraints in SAT as linear inequalities.\n\nWith this encoding, the solutions to the given instance of SAT correspond one\\-to\\-one to the pairs (A, A\u22121) satisfying all the linear constraints. This establishes a reduction from the ASP of SAT to the problem in question, and therefore the problem in question is NP\\-complete.\n\n*Remark*. This reduction can be viewed as an ASP reduction from SAT to the problem of finding a pair (A, B) of matrices satisfying given linear constraints. For more about ASP reductions, see \\[UN96] and/or \\[YS03]. (The notion of ASP reductions was used in \\[UN96], where the authors treated it as a parsimonious reduction with a certain additional property. The term \u201cASP reduction\u201d was introduced in \\[YS03].)\n\n---\n\nIn fact, the problem remains NP\\-complete even if we allow only linear constraints on the variables aij and linear constraints on the variables bij (but not a linear constraint which uses both aij and bkl). The NP\\-completeness of this restricted problem can also be shown by reduction from the ASP of SAT.\n\nThe following lemma is a key to construct this version of a reduction.\n\n**Lemma**. Let A be a real symmetric invertible matrix. Both A and A\u22121 are stochastic if and only if A is the permutation matrix of a permutation whose order is at most 2\\.\n\nI guess that this lemma can be proved more elegantly, but anyway the following proof should be at least correct.\n\n**Proof**. The \u201cif\u201d part is straightforward. To prove the \u201conly if\u201d part, assume that both A and A\u22121 are stochastic. Note the following properties of A:\n\n* Because A is symmetric, A can be diagonalizable and all eigenvalues are real.\n* Because A is stochastic, all eigenvalues have modulus at most 1\\.\n* Because A\u22121 is stochastic, all eigenvalues have modulus at least 1\\.\n\nTherefore, A can be diagonalizable and all eigenvalues are \u00b11, and therefore A is an orthogonal matrix. Since both the 1\\-norm and the 2\\-norm of each row are equal to 1, all but one entry in each row are 0\\. Therefore, A is a permutation matrix, and the only symmetric permutation matrices are the permutation matrices of some permutations whose order is at most 2\\. (end of proof of Lemma 1\\)\n\nIt is easy to write down linear constraints which enforce A to be symmetric and both A and A\u22121 to be stochastic. In addition, write down linear constraints which enforce A to be block diagonal with 2\u00d72 blocks. Given an instance of SAT with n variables x1,\u2026,xn, we encode a truth assignment by a 2n\u00d72n matrix which is block diagonal with 2\u00d72 blocks so that the first block is $\\\\pmatrix{1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1}$ if x1 is true and the first block is $\\\\pmatrix{0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0}$ if x1 is false and so on.\n\nNow that a truth assignment can be encoded as a matrix, the rest is the same: just verify that it is easy to write down the constraints in SAT as linear inequalities and that there is one\\-to\\-one correspondence between the solutions to a SAT instance and the pairs (A, A\u22121) of matrices satisfying the linear constraints.\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\n\\[UN96] Nobuhisa Ueda and Tadaaki Nagao.

The correct answer is B, as the documentation explicitly states that this problem is NP-complete, even in a restricted form where only linear constraints on A and linear constraints on A^-1 (but not mixed constraints) are allowed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the problem is not solvable in polynomial time - it's NP-complete.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the problem remains NP-complete even when restricted to separate linear constraints on A and A^-1.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the complexity doesn't depend on the number of known entries in the way described. The problem is NP-complete regardless of the proportion of known entries.\n\nThe NP-completeness is proved in the documentation through a reduction from the Another Solution Problem (ASP) of SAT, which is known to be NP-complete.

I don't want to sync entire photo library and I definately do not want to share them online.\n\nSo far I've been using the \"Export as HTML page..\" with a custom template to export starred pictures to a folder and the syncing that folder with the iPhone. However this requires some manual steps and takes a while (exporting will copy and resize pictures).\n\nAnother approach I tried is to create symlinks to starred photos in a folder (like [this](http://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/#!category-topic/picasa/picasa-for-windows/ShTC2P9QI1k)) and sync that with the iPhone. This also requires some manual steps but it's a bit faster to generate the folder.

If you are uncomfortable writing the plists for the LaunchDeamons, you can use an app like [Lingon](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lingon/id411211026?mt=12) to generate them. At this point, they may not even need to be symlinks, just a copied 'export' if you will, using the same logic.\n\nEither way, you are still stuck doing the 'iPod Photo Cache'. I think the only reason this is slightly faster when using Aperture or iPhoto is due to them having various thumbnails and other sizes rendered, but it still takes time to process, especially the first time.\n\nAssuming smaller files would actually process faster, you could also update the script that exports the stared items with symlinks to actually copy the files elsewhere, and then resize them using a tool like `sips`. \n\nFor example, `sips -Z 1024 image.jpg` would resize the image down to 1024x768, retaining the aspect ration ([more examples can be found on this blog](http://www.ainotenshi.org/818/resizing-images-using-the-command-line), or elsewhere online).\n\nYou may have to find which process works best for you and your workflow, and where the bottle neck would be. Again, if this export could be daily, outside of the actual sync to your device, that folder could always 'be ready'. \n\nThen, you just keep your iOS device sync the same, but it can process smaller files, and you have automated most of the process. The iPod Photo Cache may also be incremental, so if these files stay the same, and then just have new ones added, only the new ones are added to the cache as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user wants to sync starred photos from Picasa to their iPhone/iPad without syncing the entire photo library or sharing them online.

Is it only slightly more than the number of parameters (12\\)? Assuming you have at least, say, 24 counts:\n\nWhen you model data with a poisson distribution, you are saying that the variance of that data is equal to its mean. In other words, if you predict a count of 10000, then the variance of that count is 10000 (std.dev 100\\).\n\nIn real life, that isn't always true. Some data have more variance than this, and some less. It looks like your data has less (if we predict a count of 10000, then the variance appears to be more like 1371 rather than 10000\\).\n\nYour (non\\-quasi\\-)poisson model ignores that fact. It is taking the predictive variance to always be equal to the predictive mean even when the data indicates otherwise. This is why it thinks the parameters are insignificant, because it is highly overstating the predictive variance.\n\nIf you only have 13\\-15 rows of data then it might just be that the poisson glm happens to fit very well and the residuals were smaller than expected.\n\nIf the counts are reasonably large, the Gaussian distribution is a good approximation. If some counts are quite small (say, less than 25\\) then it works less well. Bear in mind also that if you use a Gaussian LM, the effects are additive (observing in November \\= \\+1000 birds against June, for example) rather than multiplicative (observing in November \\= x2 birds against June)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing count data of bird sightings across different months and regions. The data shows signs of underdispersion when modeled with a Poisson distribution. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the appropriate modeling approach?\n\nA) The researcher should stick to a standard Poisson distribution despite the underdispersion, as it's the default choice for count data.\n\nB) A Gaussian distribution is always preferable for count data, regardless of the dispersion pattern observed.\n\nC) The researcher should use a quasipoisson model to account for the underdispersion and obtain more reliable parameter estimates.\n\nD) Underdispersion in count data indicates that a negative binomial distribution should be used instead of Poisson.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The quasipoisson model is the most appropriate choice in this scenario. When count data shows underdispersion (variance less than the mean), a quasipoisson model can account for this by estimating a dispersion parameter. This allows for more accurate standard errors and p-values compared to a standard Poisson model, which assumes the variance equals the mean. The Gaussian distribution, while sometimes a good approximation for large counts, doesn't account for the count nature of the data. A negative binomial is typically used for overdispersion, not underdispersion. Therefore, the quasipoisson model provides the best balance of accounting for the count nature of the data while addressing the observed underdispersion."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/09", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/89667", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/28118/"], "docs_id": 89667, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The stress applied on a rod is linearly proportional to its strain. But shouldn't the opposite be true? I mean if you pull particles further apart doesn't the force they apply on each other decrease because the distance between them increases? Kinda like gravity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First we need to understand the force between individual atoms. At relatively large separations (e.g., a few atomic diameters) atoms attract each other with a force that does, as you suggest, get weaker with distance due to polarization and ionic effects that we needn't go into here. If that was all there was to the story, however, collections of atoms would all end up at zero separation, become arbitrarily dense, and spontaneously form black holes. There would be no \"rods\" in the first place!\n\nFortunately, at very small separations, atoms *repel* each other due to the large positive charges on their nuclei. That repulsive force is much stronger than the attractive force at small separations, but falls off much faster as the separation increases. \n\nAs a result there is a unique separation at which the attractive force is balanced by the repulsive force. Moreover, this equilibrium separation is *maintained* (i.e., it is a \"*stable* equilibrium\") due to the facts that\n\n1\\) If the atoms are actively pulled apart to a slightly larger separation distance, the now larger attractive force will try to pull the atoms back together and \n\n2\\) If the atoms are actively pushed together to a slightly smaller separation distance, the now larger repulsive force will try to push the atoms back apart.\n\nAll of the above is illustrated in the graph below. Notice that the attractive and repulsive forces balance at the equilibrium separation producing zero net force.  \n\n![Attractive, repulsive, and net interatomic forces as functions of interatomic separation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yu8S9.jpg)\nNotice also that for small increases in separation the net force becomes attractive. Notice especially, that for very, *very*, small increases in separation (the kind that you get when you try to stretch a rod) the net force, the \"stress,\" becomes more attractive in nearly direct (i.e., linear) proportion to the *increase* in separation, the \"strain.\"\n\nFinally, notice that, if you increase the separation by *enough*, then the net attractive force *does* start decreasing again \u2026 as you'd expect if you rip the atoms far enough apart."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A metal rod is subjected to a tensile stress. Which of the following statements best describes the atomic-level behavior and its relationship to the macroscopic stress-strain relationship?\n\nA) As the atoms are pulled apart, the attractive forces between them continuously decrease, resulting in a non-linear stress-strain relationship.\n\nB) The repulsive forces between atoms increase as they are pulled apart, causing the rod to become stiffer as it is stretched.\n\nC) For small deformations, the net interatomic force increases almost linearly with separation, leading to a linear stress-strain relationship.\n\nD) The stress-strain relationship is always non-linear because the attractive forces between atoms follow an inverse square law like gravity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. For small deformations (strains), the net interatomic force increases almost linearly with the increase in atomic separation. This microscopic behavior translates to the macroscopic linear stress-strain relationship observed in materials within their elastic limit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the attractive forces do decrease with distance, the repulsive forces decrease more rapidly, resulting in a net increase in attractive force for small separations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the repulsive forces actually decrease as atoms are pulled apart. The rod doesn't become stiffer; in fact, it experiences a restoring force trying to bring the atoms back to their equilibrium positions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while long-range attractive forces (like van der Waals forces) do decrease with distance similar to gravity, the stress-strain relationship in solids is dominated by short-range interactions for small deformations, which lead to a linear relationship."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/31", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/386844", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/40576/"], "docs_id": 386844, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I use the [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com) app for note taking in my iPad.

Also, I'm pretty sure taking out the figure would make little difference; seems like the developers never paid attention to exported file sizes.\n\nHow can I reduce this to fit into my 2 MB budget?\n\nIdeally I'd like to flip a switch inside Notability itself which reduced the export file size, but I don't think anything like that exists.\n\nOtherwise, I'm looking for free tools which would help me reduce the file size. **EDIT**: online tools are not a possibility, as I can't run the risk of my file being stored and later distributed somehow.\n\nI've already tried exporting a PDF from Preview.app with the \"Reduce File Size\" filter, which didn't make a difference.\n\nGhostscript fared a little better: `gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf` reduced the file size to 7 MB, but it's not enough for me.\n\nImageMagick's `convert` tool produced output that could be barely classified as readable, even at an alleged 600 DPI.\n\nI also tried exporting JPEGs from Notability and concatenating them with Preview.app, which produced a 4 MB file size, still unsuitable for me (and also, I lose vector rendering, searching, etc. that way, which if possible I'd like to retain).\n\nMy best result until now was running this 4 MB file through `gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf` (note `ebook` instead of `printer`). It is readable, although visibly compressed, and takes up 1\\.3 MB. Lacking any other options, this is the file I'm going to submit, but I'm hopeful there's a better solution.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming your top priority is to minimize file size. You are going to have to sacrifice and switch over to an image format. Notability uses a vast amount of vectors in order to keep your handing writing sharp and readable at any size, so we will need to discard that information in favor of a simpler , less sharp jpeg file. \n\n**If you have photoshop**, export all the files from Notability into an image format and bring them into your desktop to work on. Opening all the images inside Photoshop, use the \u201c[save for web](https://www.lifewire.com/photoshop-save-for-web-tool-tutorial-1697537)\u201d feature and select the absolute minimum of colors possible. I suggest 2 colors for the page (background \\& lines), and and 3\\-5 colors for pens (black, red, blue, green, is okay with [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) ).\n\nThis will allow you to create an image with minimal compression, at a sharper resolution. \n\n**If you have GIMP** (free and open source \\<3\\): You can add an extension that gives you similar functionality to that of Photoshop\u2019s \u201csave for web\u201d function. Here is a guide to how to install and use its different options on [TemplateToaster.com](https://templatetoaster.com/tutorials/gimp-save-for-web/).\n\nThese are both options for bringing 1920x1080 images down to about \\~\\<80 KB each with readable text and minimal compression.\n\nEdit:\n-----\n\nI thought I would include an example that I create with my own notes, exported to Jpeg directly from Goodnotes 5 (this works regardless of program). **All images are at the native resoultion of 1668x2154**\n\nBelow are the results you can expect to see. \n[![Image hsowing the difference in files sizes between compressed images and non compressed](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F36fI.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F36fI.png)\nOn the right, are the original, straight from Goodnotes exported jpegs. On the left, are the images compressed down with the \"save for web\" plugin on **[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)**.\n\nBelow are the options that I used for most of the pages, with the exception of pages with images, where instead the \"use web\\-optimized pallete\" option was selected. Note how there are only 5 colors.(page, page line, 2 pen colors, white text)\n[![image showing options used for exporting png's from Gimp](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cv4YS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cv4YS.png)\n\nUsing this option will retain all text sharpness from the original exported text.

As previously stated, you cannot expect to maintain the .pdf format and submit your work under such a tight data budget. The size of all the files combined together in the first image is in relative to a normal folder with all the images inside. When .zipped, you can expect an even larger file reduction (depending of course on the level of compression that you select with something like 7zip).

The example provided shows this method achieving an average file size of about 76 KB per page, which would allow all 12 pages to fit within the 2 MB limit.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation states that using ImageMagick's convert tool, even at 600 DPI, produced output that was barely readable."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/10/27", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/61398", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/717/"], "docs_id": 61398, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When transferring photos from the iPhone to the PC, the photos are not showed by Windows Explorer in the correct orientation, but I know there is some EXIF info in the photo with the orientation information, because Picasa shows them in the correct way.\n\n![demo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4WZ0.jpg)\n\nI have to save them with Picasa, so Windows can show them ok.\n\n**Is there some patch or program to correct this behavior?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I just found this software: [**JPEG\\-EXIF autorotate**](http://www.pilpi.net/software/JPEG-EXIF_autorotate.php).  \n\nI've not tried it and can't tell if it works fine or not, but they say it works with Windows 7\\.\n\nApparently it adds an entry in the context menu to rotate automatically the image according to the EXIF orientation data.

However, none of the answers to those questions really resolved my own question : \n\n> Is there a case where mathematical proof can replace experimentation?\n\nMost of the answers I read seem to be saying that you can mathematically prove facts about a model, but not that reality corresponds to the model. You have to experimentally validate the assumptions of the proof which demand the conclusion as true. But what if the assumptions have already been experimentally validated? \n\nFor example, if I show that if certain physical laws or accepted theories are true, a model must be (I'm not aware of such a proof, or if one exists), since the assumptions have been validated, do I still need to go through the trouble of experimentation? If we've shown it would be logically inconsistent for a conclusion to be false, and we take data that seems to be contradicting it, what's more likely to be false or mistaken \\- our logic, or our tools/experiment? I imagine that if scientists ever claimed to have found a right triangle in nature that violates Pythagorean's theorem, it would be more logical to assume they made a mistake.\n\nThe reason I ask this is because most, if not just about all of the ToEs in theoretical physics pretty much only have their mathematics going for them. The one most infamous for this is string theory. If string theory could be mathematically proven in the way I presented, and this proof was independently replicated and stood the test of time in the same way the Pythagorean theorem has, do we need to go through all the trouble of actually making an experiment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Physics remains an experimental science and so it is not possible to replace experiment by a proof. Descartes tried this when he proposed his theory of propagation of light \\- very elegant \\- but it predicted incorrectly that the angle would increase for light passing into an optically denser medium. Indeed the story goes he refused to attend a demonstration that showed him wrong \n\nA rigorous proof is essential to properly understand and extend some aspects (and possibly some limits) of a theory, and to shed light on how phenomena can be linked and explained, but has no physical applications if it predicts something that contradicts experiment. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nEdit: There is a related discussion in [this paper](http://wwwp.fc.unesp.br/~malvezzi/downloads/Ensino/Disciplinas/IntrodMecQuant/textos/What's%20bad%20about%20this%20habit%20-%20David%20Mermin.pdf) by David Mermin:\n\n> Mermin ND.

Even when assumptions have been validated and a proof seems logically sound, experiments are still necessary to confirm that the theoretical predictions match reality. The example of Descartes' incorrect theory of light propagation, despite its mathematical elegance, illustrates this point.

I also may be misconstruing the idea of decidability. However, I was wondering if all 6 of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems are decidable in the sense of G\u00f6del.\nIf any of the associated theories were not decidable, wouldn't that have far\\-reaching applications in the world of mathematics?\nThanks in advance, and I hope that my question makes sense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are very few results which allow us to know that a mathematical claim will be provable or disprovable within ZFC without actually proving or disproving it. To the best of my knowledge, the only exceptions are theories which have [quantifier elimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_elimination). Few1 open mathematical problems which people are interested in are of this sort, and none of the Millenium problems are. So any of the Millenium problems could be independent of ZFC (except for the Poincare conjecture, because it has been proved!)\n\nYou might be particularly interested in [Scott Aaronson's survey](http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf) on whether or not it is likely that $P \\\\neq NP$ is independent of ZFC.\n\n1 Here is an example of a question which I know is decidable in ZFC, yet whether the answer is \"yes\" or \"no\" is open.\n\n> Do there exist $44$ vectors $(u\\_i,\n> \\> v\\_i, w\\_i, x\\_i, y\\_i)$ in\n>  $\\\\mathbb{R}^5$, each with length $1$,\n>  and with the dot product between each\n>  pair $\\\\leq 1/2$? See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number) for background.\n\nThis is the a first order question about real numbers, so it is decidable by [Tarski's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field). The analogous result for four dimensional vectors was only obtained in [2003](http://mr.crossref.org/iPage/?doi=10.1070%252FRM2003v058n04ABEH000651); if you can get the answer for $5$ dimensions, it should be publishable in a good journal.

According to the StackExchange response, there are very few results that allow us to know if a mathematical claim will be provable or disprovable within ZFC without actually proving or disproving it. The Millennium Prize Problems, except for the solved Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, do not fall into the category of problems with known decidability. The response specifically mentions that none of the Millennium problems are of the type that have quantifier elimination, which is one of the few ways to establish decidability without solving the problem.

I suggest to use a solar charge controller of 10A which supports both 12 \\& 24 volts (can be used for multiple applications if not giving desired output). Be sure to check input voltage range before buying charge controller or try to add a LED voltmeter/rpm meter for input so that you can avoid over voltage. If you can share what is going to run in the battery, i can suggest better solution. How much watt is the load or how much current the load required?\nEdit: You can use dummy load (search online) so that over voltage can be avoided. Or hook up a LED with zinner diode \\& some resistors so that light will glow if the voltage is exceeding charge controller's input range \\& you can stop pedaling. Best option is to choose a charge controller which has auto shutdown feature for your ease \\& project safety."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a stationary bike generator system using a salvaged treadmill motor. The motor specs are 180 VDC, 4500 RPM, 1.3 HP, and 6 amp. The system needs to safely charge a 120 Ah 12V AGM deep cycle marine battery. Which of the following combinations would be the most suitable and safe solution for this setup?\n\nA) Use the motor directly connected to the battery with a simple voltage divider circuit to reduce voltage\nB) Implement a 24V battery system with a 10A solar charge controller that supports both 12V and 24V\nC) Connect the motor directly to the 12V battery with a current-limiting resistor\nD) Use a 48V battery system with a buck converter to step down the voltage\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most suitable and safe solution for this setup. Using a 24V battery system (two 12V batteries in series) is appropriate because the generated voltage can reach up to 30V. A 10A solar charge controller that supports both 12V and 24V provides flexibility and safety features. This setup can handle the variable input voltage from the generator, protect against overcharging, and is adaptable for future use. Options A and C are unsafe as they lack proper voltage regulation and battery management. Option D uses an unnecessarily high voltage battery system, which adds complexity and potential safety risks."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/07", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/37536", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/6792/"], "docs_id": 37536, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Excuse me, in a course of linear algebra, our assistant stated that, if $\\\\mathbb{V}$ is a finite\\-dimensional vector space, and $\\\\mathbb{W}$ its double dual, $\\\\mathbb{V}$ and $\\\\mathbb{W}$ are actually equal to each other; I am wondering if this has anything to do with the viewpoint in algebraic number theory that realizes elements, in algebraic number fields, as functions?  \n\nIn any case, thank you very much.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Regarding your second question, it is true in some informal sense that when we view elements of a commutative ring $R$ as functions on $\\\\text{Spec } R$, we are also viewing the points $\\\\text{Spec } R$ as functions on $R$; in fact they are precisely the morphisms $R \\\\to k$ where $k$ is a field, up to a certain equivalence relation. So I would say that this is not completely unrelated to double duals of vector spaces, although there isn't a direct formal connection since in this case the dual of an object is a different kind of object. This is sometimes summarized in the slogan \"algebra is dual to geometry.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In algebraic geometry, the relationship between a commutative ring R and its spectrum Spec R is often described as a duality. This concept shares some similarities with the relationship between a finite-dimensional vector space and its double dual. Which of the following statements most accurately describes this connection?\n\nA) The elements of R and the points of Spec R are in a one-to-one correspondence, just like a vector space and its double dual.\n\nB) The elements of R can be viewed as functions on Spec R, while the points of Spec R can be viewed as morphisms from R to a field, illustrating a form of duality similar to, but distinct from, vector space double duals.\n\nC) The spectrum Spec R is isomorphic to the double dual of R when R is considered as a vector space over itself.\n\nD) The duality between R and Spec R is exactly the same as the duality between a finite-dimensional vector space and its double dual, with no significant differences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the essence of the duality in algebraic geometry without overstating the similarity to vector space duality. Elements of R can indeed be viewed as functions on Spec R, and points of Spec R correspond to morphisms from R to a field (up to equivalence). This relationship is similar in spirit to the duality between a vector space and its dual, but it's not identical. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the correspondence is not one-to-one in the same way as with vector spaces and their double duals. \n\nOption C is incorrect because Spec R is not generally isomorphic to a vector space dual, and R is not typically considered as a vector space over itself in this context. \n\nOption D overstates the similarity, ignoring the important differences between algebraic geometry and linear algebra contexts.\n\nThis question tests understanding of both vector space duality and the more abstract notion of duality in algebraic geometry, requiring students to discern the similarities and differences between these concepts."}}
