A common mistake is to believe they are the same thing \\-\\- after all, they're tied together back in the main panel, that's the same as tying them everywhere, right? Nope.\n\nNeutral is a working conductor: it is a normal current return path. It \"works for a living\". It's subject to voltage drop, for instance. It must be tightly paired with the \"hot\" conductors so the wires' magnetic fields cancel each other out. \n\nEquipment Ground is *an emergency safety shield*. Normal current must *never* flow over it! Any current on ground is *fault current* and we certainly hope that is caught soon. \n\nThe purpose of the tie back at the main panel is **equipotential bonding**. The bond could be a car battery (intentional 12VDC bias between N and G); or a 2V transformer (2VAC offset between N and G) \\-\\- who cares \\-\\- the point is to **bond** neutral to be **near** earth, and thus keep hots within around 120/230V of earth \\- otherwise they could float/rattle at high voltages and be much more lethal. \n\n---\n\nSo why the sparks? \n\nBetween the two neutrals, it's because there are *downline loads* being served by that neutral. When you sever a neutral, you cut off current flow, and the downline load \"lifts\" the neutral wire to 120V. Now you have 120V across those two neutrals. When you touch them together again, you complete the circuit and the downline load comes back on again. The spark is small because it's current\\-limited by what the downline load will draw. \n\nBetween neutral and ground, it's because you have paralleled neutral and ground. **when you parallel 2 wires (don't), current flows in proportion to their *conductivity*.** The conductivity of neutral and ground are pretty close, so when you do that (don't), about half the current flows via ground instead of neutral. Again the downline load limits current, so the spark stays small. \n\nWhy is neutral and ground not precisely the same voltage? Because neutral is *workin' for a living*, and ground is not. You're seeing **voltage drop on the neutral**, which since a neutral starts at 0V, tends to *lift* the neutral's voltage up a volt or two. It's the same effect as a beam\\-style torque wrench: the heavy beam bends with the many foot\\-pounds of torque, but the indicator beam is under no strain, so remains straight. The difference indicates torque. \n\nIf you knew the exact resistance of the neutral wire, you could compute current using that observed ground\\-neutral voltage difference \"E\", and known neutral resistance \"R\", plug them into E\\=IR and out pops I, your amps. \n\nOh yeah... your bulbs\n---------------------\n\nYour problem is completely unrelated to this garden walk through the world of neutrals and bonding. The readings you're asking about were a red herring, sorry. Since you have a DVM, measure voltages on circuits in your house which work \\- as many as possible \\- and look for anything weird, *especially* some below 120V with others equally *above* 120V."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a residential circuit where light bulbs frequently burn out. Upon testing, they observe sparks when connecting neutral wires or neutral to ground, and measure 4.2V between line and neutral/ground with the switch off. What is the MOST likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The neutral and ground wires are incorrectly bonded throughout the house, causing a voltage potential between them.\n\nB) There is a high-resistance connection in the neutral path, causing voltage drop and potential difference between neutral and ground.\n\nC) The sparks are normal behavior caused by capacitive coupling in the wiring, and unrelated to the bulb failures.\n\nD) The main panel has an improper ground-neutral bond, allowing current to flow on the ground wire under normal conditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The sparks observed when connecting neutrals or neutral to ground, along with the measured voltage between line and neutral/ground with the switch off, strongly suggest a high-resistance connection in the neutral path. This causes voltage drop along the neutral, creating a potential difference between neutral and ground. This condition can lead to overvoltage on some circuits, explaining the frequent bulb burnouts. Options A and D are incorrect because they describe improper bonding, which would not explain the observed voltage with the switch off.

I've implemented few internal websites for my company with it. And STILL, I don't 100% get it. I believe one of the best ways to learn something is to follow strictly defined rules.\n\n**So my question is:** What is the most strict PHP framework in terms of how MVC pattern is implemented? One that defines how I use models, controllers, and views so that I can completely get what MVC is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Short answer\n\nThere is no such thing.\n\n### Longer version:\n\nFrameworks do not implement MVC or MVC\\-inspired design pattern. Your application does.\n\nMVC is not some magic sauce, that you can add to your application by dumping it in a framework. Instead, you would actually have to learn and understand said pattern *(and the accompanying principles and practices, like [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [LoD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter), [SoC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_Concerns))*. Only then you can try to use it within your choice of a framework.\n\nIf a framework advertises that it *\"has MVC\"*, then it is completely utter *dren*. In that situation, it is used to \"sell\" the framework to the noobs that care more about the latest hype then about application design and coding practices.\n\nThe goal of a framework would be to provide you collection of tools, that, when used as whole, provide you with an altered/improved development environment. They deal with such things as routing, autoloading, low level abstractions for storage (no, I am not talking about active record anti\\-pattern) and the rest of thing that let save you time in boh development and maintenance.\n\n### In conclusion.\n\nThere are no MVC frameworks in PHP. All of those who claim to me such are actually among the worst ones. Namely \\- codeigniter, cakephp and yii. Avoid them at all costs (except if you get paid really well for it).\n\nIf you *need* to use a framework, currently your best options would be latest version of Symfony 2\\.x, Zend Framework 2\\.x or Laravel 4\\.x.

Instead, it's the developer's responsibility to understand and apply the MVC pattern, along with other important principles like SOLID, Law of Demeter, and Separation of Concerns. The answer states that frameworks provide tools to improve the development environment, but they don't enforce MVC. It also warns against frameworks that claim to \"have MVC,\" suggesting these might be misleading. The correct approach is to learn and understand the pattern deeply, then apply it within your chosen framework.

But what is MapReduce itself? How does it work? I came across this [blog post](http://blog.soliveirajr.com/intro-to-parallel-processing-with-mapreduce/) that tries to explain just MapReduce without Hadoop, but I still have some questions.\n\n* Does MapReduce really have an intermediate phase called *grouping* as the article describes?\n* Can the grouping phase also be done in parallel or only the map and reduce phases?\n* Does the map and reduce operations described in the article make sense for the problem proposed (indexing web pages by keywords)? They look too simple to me.\n* Is the main purpose of MapReduce really just parallelization when indexing large amounts of data?\n* Do you think too many people know Hadoop without understanding the fundamentals of MapReduce? Is it a problem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: MapReduce actually has a grouping phase. The map phase essentially consists in transforming inputs into pairs of (key,value) elements. Because the reduce phase consists in \"aggregating\" all the values associated to the same key, you cannot avoid the need to group all values by key before the reduce phase. This may need a lot of time since values must be shuffled over the cluster. \n\nThe grouping phase can be made in parallel. Basically, a cluster node is associated to each generated key. Then, all the generated pairs of (key, value) are sent to the node associated to their key. This typically leads to an important network overload, and this phase is considered as network bounded. \n\nThe indexing of Web pages by keyword is a typical application of MapReduce. More generally, dictionary reversing can almost directly be described as a MapReduce task. You can see it as a process for building a basic search engine: you want to find Web sites containing \u00e0 particular keyword. Because you don't have time to browse all the sites for each incoming query, you have to prepare a reverse dictionary of (keyword, websites).\n\nMapReduce is not limited to indexing tasks. The map and reduce tasks can be less or more complex than those required for an indexing. You can also combine several map and reduce tasks for carrying out more complex data processing. For instance, Apache Pig provides a SQL\\-like language for describing \"complex\" MapReduce jobs.\n\nI don't think you can correctly use Hadoop (directly) without mastering its basis. You cannot correctly describe a map or a reduce task if you don't understand how the framework will use it for processing submitted data. A deeper understanding of the MapReduce mechanism also helps to understand why a job takes so long, or why adding CPUs will not help to reduce processing time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about MapReduce is NOT correct?\n\nA) The grouping phase in MapReduce can be parallelized, with each cluster node associated with a specific key.\n\nB) MapReduce is primarily used for indexing tasks and cannot be applied to more complex data processing scenarios.\n\nC) The grouping phase in MapReduce is necessary to aggregate all values associated with the same key before the reduce phase.\n\nD) Understanding the fundamentals of MapReduce is crucial for efficiently using Hadoop and optimizing job performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The incorrect statement is B. While indexing tasks (like indexing web pages by keywords) are a common application of MapReduce, it is not limited to just indexing. MapReduce can be used for various complex data processing tasks. The documentation mentions that map and reduce tasks can be more or less complex than those required for indexing, and multiple map and reduce tasks can be combined for more sophisticated data processing. It also references Apache Pig, which provides a SQL-like language for describing complex MapReduce jobs.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are all correct statements based on the information provided in the documentation.

However, in this case, the system is not effectively clearing the cache when new processes require memory, leading to out of memory errors. This suggests that the issue lies in the system's cache management rather than with Samba or hardware limitations.\n\nThe correct answer (C) identifies that while caching is expected, the problem arises from ineffective cache clearing when memory is needed for other processes. A long-term solution would involve improving the system's cache management, possibly through kernel parameter tuning or updating the operating system to a version with better memory management for low-RAM devices like the Raspberry Pi.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the caching itself is not a mistake.

So one version of this question is about how to compare $D(I)$ to this limit. Here we show the limit can go arbitrarily close to $1$ with $D(I)\\=2$. By adding random linear factors, the limit can get arbitrarily close to $D(I)\\-1$. But probably for larger $D(I)$ the limit can be less than $D(I)$ by even more than $1$.\n\n---\n\nSome lower bounds:\n\nIn the case where $I$ is radical, if $D(I) \\\\geq 2$, then $D(I^n) \\\\geq (3/2\\)n$ (and in fact $\\\\lceil (3/2\\) n \\\\rceil$ is achieved.) $V(I)$ must not be contained in any line, so it must contain $3$ noncolinear points, and we can assume that $I$ is the ideal of $3$ noncolinear points. Then $I^n$ is the ideal of functions vanishing of order $n$ at those $3$ points. This contains a function of degree $(3/2\\)n$, which is the product of powers of the lines through the points.\n\nThis is optimal, because given a polynomial $f$, which is the first line raised to the power $a$ times a polynomial of degree $d\u2212a$, the polynomial of degree $d\u2212a$ must intersect the two points on the first line with multiplicity $n\u2212a$, so $d\u2212a \\\\geq 2(n\u2212a)$ and if $d\\\\leq (3/2\\)n$, $a \\\\geq n/2$. Then the same is true for the multiplicity of the other $3$ lines, hence $d\\\\geq 3n/2$.\n\n---\n\nHere's another interesting phenomenon. Take $I$ to be the ideal of $k (k\\+1\\) /2$ generic points. Then $D(I)\\= k$ by dimension counting. $I^n$ is the ideal of functions vanishing of order $n$ at $k(k\\+1\\)/2$ distinct points, which is an ideal of codimension $n (n\\+1\\)/2 \\\\cdot k (k\\+1\\)/2$. This is less than $d (d\\+1\\)/2$ for $d$ approximately equal to $nk / \\\\sqrt{2}$. So there is a degree $d$ polynomial in $I^n$, and $D(I^n)$ is asymptotically at most $nk/\\\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n---\n\nI can show that if $D(I) \\\\geq 2$, then $\\\\lim\\_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} D(I^n)/ n\\> 1$. Take $I$ maximal with respect to the property $D(I) \\\\geq 2$. Then each local factor of $I$ at a point of $V(I)$ either contains two linear functions, or is maximal with respect to the property of containing one linear function, and hence looks like $(y, x^2\\)$, or is maximal with respect to the property of containing no linear functions, and hence looks.\n\nWhat do the last kind of ideals look like? There must be some length $1$ extension, which must contain some linear function $y$, and so it is of the form $(x^k,y)$ for some $n$. Length one extensions of that have the form $(x^{k\\+1}, xy, y^2, ax^k\\+ by)$ and we must have $a \\\\neq 0$. If $b \\=0$, the ideal contains is contained in $(x^2, xy, y^2\\)$, which is one example of a maximal ideal with this property. Otherwise by scaling $y$, we may put it in the form of my example.\n\nCase 1: $I\\= (x^2, xy, y^2\\)$. An element in $I^n$ vanishes to order $2n$ on $I$, hence has degree at least $2n$.\n\nCase 2: $I \\= (y\\-x^k, x^{k\\+1})$. An element in $I^n$ intersects $y\\-x^k$ with multiplicity $n (k\\+1\\)$, hence has degree at least $n (k\\+1\\)/k$. Having $(y\\-x^k)$ divide the element doesn't help because it has degree $k$ but only removes $k\\+1$ of the intersection.\n\nCase 3: $I$ contained in $(y, x^2\\)$. Then $I$ must also vanish somewhere else on the line $y\\=0$. If the degree is at most $(3/2\\)n$ the intersection multiplicity with the line $x\\=0$ is at least $2n$ so by the same logic as in the reduced case the polynomial contains a factor of $x^{n/2}$. The remainder of the polynomial must vanish to order $n$ at the other point on the line $y\\=0$ hence have degree at least $n$, so the minimum is $(3/2\\)n$.\n\nCase 4: $I$ is contained in none of these and is maximal, hence reducd.

For example : \n\n```\n    always @* begin\n\n        number_of_incoming_data_bytes_next <= number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg;\n        generate_input_fifo_push_pulse_next <= generate_input_fifo_push_pulse;\n\n        if(state_reg == idle) begin\n            // mealey outputs\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n\n            if((rx_done_tick) && (rx_data_out == START_BYTE)) begin\n                state_next = read_incoming_data_length;\n                end else begin\n                    state_next = idle;\n                end\n\n        end else if(state_reg == read_incoming_data_length) begin\n            // mealey outputs\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n\n            if(rx_done_tick) begin\n                number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg <= rx_data_out;\n                state_next = reading;\n            end else begin\n                state_next = read_incoming_data_length;\n            end\n\n        end else if(state_reg == reading) begin\n\n            if(count_reg == number_of_incoming_data_bytes_reg) begin\n                state_next = idle;\n                // do something to indicate that all the reading is done\n                // and to send all the data in the fifo\n            end else begin\n                if(rx_done_tick) begin\n                    generate_input_fifo_push_pulse_next = ~ generate_input_fifo_push_pulse;\n                    count_next = count_reg + 1;\n                end else begin\n                    count_next = count_reg;\n                end\n            end\n\n        end else begin\n            count_next = 8'b0;\n            state_next = idle;\n        end\n    end\n\n```\n\nIn the above code, how would the synthesized circuit change if I replaced all the blocking assignments by non\\-blocking \n\n2\\) Understanding the difference between blocking and non\\-blocking statements when written sequentially is a bit simpler (and most answers to this question focus on this part), but how do blocking assignments affect behaviours when they are declared in separate conditional behaviours. For example :\n\nWould it make a difference if I wrote this:\n\n```\nif(rx_done_tick) begin\n    a = 10;\nend else begin\n    a = 8;\nend\n\n```\n\nor if I wrote this : \n\n```\nif(rx_done_tick) begin\n    a <= 10;\nend else begin\n    a <= 8;\nend\n\n```\n\nI know that conditional statements synthesize to become multiplexers or priority structures, and so I feel that using either blocking or non\\-blocking statements should not make a difference, but I am not sure.\n\n3\\) When writing testbenches, I the result of the simulation is very different when using blocking v/s non\\-blocking statements.\nThe behaviour is very different if I write : \n\n```\ninitial begin\n    #31 rx_data_out = 255;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out = 3;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out = 10;\n    rx_done_tick = 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick = 0;\nend\n\n```\n\nversus when I write this : \n\n```\ninitial begin\n    #31 rx_data_out <= 255;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out <= 3;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\n    #30 rx_data_out <= 10;\n    rx_done_tick <= 1;\n    #2 rx_done_tick <= 0;\nend\n\n```\n\nThis is very confusing. In my practice, the rx\\_done\\_tick signal is going to be generated by a Flip Flop. So, I think that non\\-blocking statements should be used to represent this behaviour. Am I right ?\n\n4\\) Finally, when to use blocking assignments and when not to use non\\-blocking statements ? I.e is it true that blocking statements should be used only in combinational behaviours , and non\\-blocking statements in sequential behaviours only? If yes or No, why ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The blocking vs non blocking assignment is a crucial concept and you have difficulty to implement them correctly because you have not understood the conceptual difference. \n\nI have attached a slide of MIT OCV PowerPoint lecture, 2005, that clearly describe the difference between the two\n\n[![Blocking vs non blocking assignment](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrgHa.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrgHa.png)\n\nYou must understand the concept of RHL (Right Hand Side) calculation. Verilog always calculates the RHS and puts it into LHS. In blocking, the assignment happens exactly after the calculation is done, while in non\\-blocking, the assignment of RHS to LHS happens when the end of block is reached. That is why as 'the Photon' has mentioned for single lines both blocking and non\\-blocking will be the same but if you have more than one lines then things MIGHT change or might not change!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following Verilog code snippet:\n\n```verilog\nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    a = b + 1;\n    c = a + 2;\nend\n```\n\nWhat would be the correct way to rewrite this using non-blocking assignments to maintain the same functionality?\n\nA) \nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    a <= b + 1;\n    c <= a + 2;\nend\n\nB) \nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    a <= b + 1;\n    c <= (b + 1) + 2;\nend\n\nC)\nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    c <= a + 2;\n    a <= b + 1;\nend\n\nD)\nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    a <= b + 1;\n    #1 c <= a + 2;\nend\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In the original code with blocking assignments, 'a' is updated immediately with 'b + 1', and then 'c' uses this new value of 'a'.

Option B correctly calculates 'c' using the new value of 'a' (which is b + 1) without relying on the intermediate assignment to 'a'.

The entropy is increased because of this property of energy \\- i.e. tendency to move. This tendency to move results into loss of energy from a system, and also results into disorder into a system.

The fundamental forces themselves do not directly cause an increase in entropy. Rather, they enable the conversion and movement of energy in the universe. This movement of energy, whether in the form of electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, or kinetic energy of particles, leads to a loss of energy from systems and an increase in disorder.

As far as I remember there was a limit of around 32k characters for this so this shouldn't be causing the truncation. This works via a format string that is identified by the event id and a set of values that are stored with the event. The `value: %` piece is such.

The cited paper is about motors in the area of 2000 to 3000 RPM.\n\nMotor weight and volume is somewhat proportional to torque and not so much related to power. A motor of a given size will provide the same torque over wide range of speeds. The higher the speed, the higher the power for the same size motor. The same thing is generally true for heat engines also.\n\nSee if the cited paper makes sense with that in mind.\n\n> I still don't understand the connection of these 2 arguments WRT the NASA paper.\n\nThe paper is lengthly and complex. It cites several references to other papers. This forum is intended to deal only with relatively narrow questions. I only scanned the paper briefly.\n\n> If heat engines also follow this trend, then why are people pursuing DEP all of a sudden?\n\nSerious large electric aircraft design is a new field. We should expect to see a lot of approaches explored. There is significant history in determining optimum number if engines for aircraft as illustrated below.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJ1Cq.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJ1Cq.jpg)\n\n> ... the continuous power/weight ratio of electric motors actually decreases with size...\n\nSince power \\= torque X rotational speed, a power/weight ratio is only meaningful if either torque or speed is constant for a given comparison.\n\nIn all aspects of this question, the balance of system (BOS) is an important factor. The BOS includes the control and monitoring system, fuel storage and delivery system, lubrication system, cooling system, structural support and enclosure system and perhaps others. Some parts of these may be integral to the motor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why the power-to-weight ratio of electric motors for aviation applications appears to decrease with increasing size, contrary to the claim of scale-agnostic power-to-weight ratios mentioned in the NASA paper?\n\nA) Larger motors inherently have lower efficiency due to increased electromagnetic losses.\n\nB) The power-to-weight ratio is actually constant, but measurement methods differ between small and large motors.\n\nC) Cooling limitations in larger motors restrict their continuous power output relative to their weight.\n\nD) Larger motors are intentionally overbuilt to meet stringent aerospace safety standards, sacrificing power-to-weight ratio.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As motor size increases, the ability to dissipate heat (which is proportional to surface area) grows more slowly than the motor's volume and weight. This means that larger motors become more limited by their ability to shed heat, restricting their continuous power output relative to their weight. Small hobby motors can achieve high power-to-weight ratios partly because they can operate at very high RPMs, but larger aviation motors are constrained to lower RPM ranges and must deal with more significant cooling challenges. This cooling limitation is a key factor in the apparent decrease in power-to-weight ratio as motor size increases for aviation applications."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/16", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/125198", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/76666/"], "docs_id": 125198, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the process of buying a new bungalow.

Meaning an increase in their internal energy.\n\nIs this an increase in the internal energy due to pressure?\nOr an increase in temperature due to pressure which in turn increases the energy?\nHow do I see this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For an ideal gas [the internal energy only depends on the temperature of the gas](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/389130/179151). How the temperature relates to pressure is easily seen in the [ideal gas law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law) $$PV\\=NkT$$ \nSo I suppose one could make the argument that the internal energy for the ideal gas depends on the quantity $$\\\\frac{PV}{Nk}$$\nand it's up to you how you want to explain the dependency. The problem with this though is that, depending on the process, these variables are constrained to evolve in certain ways. \n\nIndeed, for your compression example, how you are compressing the gas matters. I will cover some typical examples:\n\n---\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that its pressure is inversely proportional to it's volume, then by the ideal gas law the temperature remains constant. It turns out that in this case the heat that leaves the gas is exactly balanced by the work you do on it. The internal energy does not change.\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that its pressure remains constant, then by the ideal gas law the temperature drops in proportion to the volume. In this case more energy leaves the system as heat than what you put in as work. The internal energy decreases.\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that no heat enters or leaves the system, then all the work you do goes into increasing the internal energy, and hence the temperature of the gas. This process is probably what you had in mind. Here the pressure and volume both change, but the pressure increases in a larger proportion than the volume decreases$^\\*$. Therefore, by the ideal gas law the temperature increases.\n\n---\n\n$^\\*$ In fact, for this process the value $PV^\\\\gamma$ is constant where $\\\\gamma\\>1$. So, if $V$ decreases by a factor $x\\>1$, then $P$ must increase by a factor of $x^{\\\\gamma}$.

For an ideal gas, internal energy is a function of temperature only, not pressure directly.

An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines contradictory terms.

The collection SQL works fine outside of Magento. What is the most likely cause of this issue and how can it be resolved?\n\nA) The 'DIF_AU' column is not properly defined in the collection's select statement. Add the column definition to the main select query.\n\nB) The 'having' clause is not supported in Magento's collection classes. Remove the 'having' clause and use a 'where' condition instead.\n\nC) The error occurs in the getSelectCountSql() method, which doesn't include the 'DIF_AU' column definition. Extend this method in your custom collection class to include the missing column.\n\nD) The 'addAttributeHaving' method is not compatible with Magento's collection classes. Rewrite the method using standard Magento collection filtering techniques.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue arises because the getSelectCountSql() method, used for pagination, doesn't include the 'DIF_AU' column definition. This method generates a separate SQL query for counting records, which lacks the column used in the HAVING clause. To resolve this, you need to extend the getSelectCountSql() method in your custom collection class to add back the missing column required for the HAVING statement. This ensures that the count query includes the necessary column definition, allowing the HAVING clause to function correctly."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/31", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/76525", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/18612/"], "docs_id": 76525, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Positive reactions from stock markets can be described as the markets \"rallying peters out\".

That said, even if you do lose a private key, it's usually not that big of a deal, as long as you can get the corresponding public key on all systems that use it changed to a new one."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between public and private SSH keys?\n\nA) Public keys should be kept secret, while private keys can be shared freely\nB) Multiple people can share the same private key for increased security\nC) The public key can be shared openly, but the private key must be kept secret\nD) Both public and private keys should be publicly accessible for maximum convenience\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. In SSH key authentication, the public key can be freely shared and distributed to systems or services where you want to authenticate. It's often posted on websites or shared with others. However, the private key must be kept strictly confidential and should only be accessible to its owner. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the roles of public and private keys. \nOption B is wrong because sharing private keys compromises security and defeats the purpose of personal authentication. \nOption D is incorrect because making both keys public would allow anyone to impersonate the key owner.\n\nThis question tests understanding of basic SSH key concepts, the distinction between public and private keys, and their proper usage in authentication systems."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/30", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/384062", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/219070/"], "docs_id": 384062, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **PARTITIONING** (e.g. `fdisk`)  \n\nWhat are some useful commands used for partitioning an additional hard drive from the command\\-line?

From the rumors I've heard, apparently there's some connection between the geometry of the skeleton and the Fukaya category of the symplectic manifold; this is understood well in the case of a cotangent bundle from work of [Nadler](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0612399) and [Nadler\\-Zaslow](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604379)\n\nI'm very interested in the Fukaya categories of some manifolds like\nthis, but the only thing I've actually seen written on the subject is\nPaul Seidel's moderately famous picture of Kontsevich carpet\\-bombing\nhis research program\n\n[![This flaming pile of rubble is my research plans for the next few years](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDMOH.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDMOH.jpg)\n\nwhich may be amusing, but isn't very\nmathematically rigorous. Google searching hasn't turned up much, so I\nwas wondering if any of you have anything to suggest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I noticed this question has been bumped up to the front page, and the\nmost recent answer is about 8 years old: the subject has moved on\nsince then, and more has been written. Here is my understanding of\nsome of the recent developments.\n\nCaveat: This whole area has undergone rapid progress in the last few\nyears, and I am not working on this question, so what I say is\nprobably not up\\-to\\-date (even as I write, never mind in the future).\n\nKontsevich's idea was that you can relate the Fukaya category of a\nWeinstein manifold to the microlocal sheaf category of its\nskeleton. As far as I know, a proof of this conjecture is work in\nprogress by Ganatra\\-Pardon\\-Shende ([one preliminary part of which is\nalready available](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03152)).\n\nI think the idea of their proof is roughly the following:\n\n* You prove that the Fukaya category has a co\\-sheaf property, which\nmeans it can be computed locally first on some subsets and then the\nanswer can be glued together using homotopy colimits. For this, you\nneed suitable functors relating the Fukaya category of a subset to\nthe Fukaya category of the whole manifold. This is complicated by\nthe fact that your \"subsets\" might not be very nicely embedded in the\nwhole manifold: for example, if your ambient manifold is $T^\\*M$ then\nyou want to allow subsets like $T^\\*M'$ where $M'\\\\subset M$ is a\ncodimension zero submanifold with boundary (that's because you\nultimately want to work locally on the skeleton). That is\nproblematic because the Liouville vector field for $T^\\*M'$ and the\nLiouville vector field for $TM$ don't match up nicely. The first GPS\npaper constructs these categories and functors for \"Liouville\nsectors\" (a suitably broad class of inclusions, related to [Sylvan's\nnotion of stops and partially wrapped Floer homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02540)). I think the proof of the co\\-sheaf property is still ongoing work?\n* Now you compute the local pieces of the Fukaya category and show\nthat they agree with the microlocal sheaf categories; since both\nhave co\\-sheaf gluing, you get the same global answers.\n\nThe second part relies on some local computations of Fukaya\ncategories. [Nadler has introduced the\nnotion of \"arboreal skeleton\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4122) which is a skeleton with certain\n\"generic\" singularities. For example, trivalent graphs in dimension 1;\ntrivalent graph times interval or cone on 1\\-skeleton of a tetrahedron\nin dimension 2; etc. He computes the microlocal sheaf category for\nthese; I'm not sure if the corresponding partially\\-wrapped Fukaya\ncategories have been calculated in all cases yet. Finally, you want to\nshow that any Weinstein manifold has an arboreal skeleton:\n[Starkston has some results in this\ndirection which may represent the state of the art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03446).\n\nLeaving this aside for a moment, there are also special cases where\nthe Konstevich conjecture/local\\-to\\-global results for the Fukaya\ncategory has been established independently of this general\nprogram. These include (but again, I'm probably missing some):\n\n* Nadler [https://arxiv.org/abs/1601\\.02977](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02977)\n* Pascaleff\\-Sibilla [https://arxiv.org/abs/1604\\.06448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06448)\n* Nadler [https://arxiv.org/abs/1604\\.00114](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00114)\n* Lee [https://arxiv.org/abs/1608\\.04473](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04473)\n* Gammage\\-Nadler [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702\\.03255](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03255)\n* Shende [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707\\.07663](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07663)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current state of research regarding Kontsevich's conjecture on relating the Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold to the microlocal sheaf category of its skeleton?\n\nA) The conjecture has been fully proven and widely accepted in the mathematical community.\n\nB) The conjecture remains completely unaddressed, with no significant progress made since Kontsevich's initial proposal.\n\nC) A complete proof is still in progress, but significant advancements have been made, including the development of co-sheaf properties for Fukaya categories and computations of local pieces.\n\nD) The conjecture has been disproven, leading researchers to abandon this line of inquiry entirely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that while a complete proof of Kontsevich's conjecture is still a work in progress, significant advancements have been made.

A strange colloidal suspension of liquid and gas that can act as a solid but still has some properties of a liquid ( surface tension, capillary action). While foams can keep their shape, it's not guaranteed and dependent on surface tension, self adhesion, and gas pressure in individual bubbles. Beer foam keeps its shape much better than champagne foam for these reasons.\n\nAs a carbonated liquid is poured, foam is created and grows following the shape of the glass. During this process the foam adheres to the glass (partly due to capillary forces) as the foam rises. When the foam reaches the rim the change in capillary/adhesion forces stretch the bubbles until they break at the rim. The popping of these bubbles wet the rim of the glass and eventually, the capillary forces will wick the foam over the rim if the pouring is too aggressive.\n\nI don't have an answer to your champagne pouring strategy except to suggest that the initial pour allows a \"softer\" follow up pour by replacing a liquid\\-solid collision with a liquid\\-liquid collision."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why beer foam tends to maintain its shape better than champagne foam?\n\nA) Beer foam has a higher gas pressure in individual bubbles\nB) Beer foam has stronger surface tension and self-adhesion properties\nC) Beer foam is less affected by capillary forces\nD) Beer foam has larger bubbles that are more resistant to breaking\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is B.

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate and helpful for installing and maintaining IRAF?\n\nA) IRAF can only be installed on Ubuntu by manually compiling the source code from NOAO's website.\n\nB) The best way to install IRAF is to download the Debian package and use dpkg to install it on any Ubuntu version.\n\nC) IRAF is available in the Ubuntu universe repository for versions 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and later, making installation and maintenance easier.\n\nD) Creating a Personal Package Archive (PPA) is necessary to install and maintain IRAF on Ubuntu systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that IRAF is packaged in Ubuntu since Bionic Beaver 18.04 LTS in the universe repository. This means users can install and update IRAF using Ubuntu's package management system (apt) for versions 18.04 and later, which is the easiest and most maintainable method. Option A is incorrect as manual compilation is not necessary. Option B is less ideal as it involves manually handling Debian packages. Option D is unnecessary since IRAF is already in the official Ubuntu repositories."}}
