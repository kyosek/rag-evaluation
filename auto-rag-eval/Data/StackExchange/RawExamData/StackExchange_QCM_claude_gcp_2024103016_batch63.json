Thank you for any hint.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it can be found explicitly, though not in elementary functions but in terms of a combination of elementary and hypergeometric functions.\nThe problem is (almost) equivalent to finding a conformal map\nfrom your straight strip onto the broken strip. For this it is sufficient to find \na conformal map from the upper half\\-plane onto the UPPER half of the broken strip (and then apply the Schwarz Symmetry principle). This map of the upper half\\-plane on the upper half\nof the broken strip is given by the Christoffel\\-Schwarz formula\n$$C\\\\int\\_0^z\\\\zeta^{\\\\beta\\-1}(\\\\zeta\\-T)^{\\-\\\\beta} d\\\\zeta,$$\nwhere $\\\\alpha\\=\\\\pi\\\\beta$. This integral can be explicitly expressed in terms of\nhypergeometric function. I hope these hints are enough to make an explicit computation.\n\nIn a comment you ask about dependence on $T$. Dependence on $T$ is trivial:\nIf $F$ is the conformal mapping corresponding to $T\\=1$, normalized such that\n$F(0\\)\\=0,F(1\\)\\=1,F(\\\\infty\\_j)\\=\\\\infty\\_j, j\\=1,2$ then $TF(z/T)$ is the\nmap corresponding to $T$.\n\nRemark. According to a theorem of Chebyshev, this integral is not an elementary function when $\\\\beta$ is irrational. Therefore I suppose that the solution of\nyour problem is also not an elementary function.\n\nHere are some more detail. Let $T\\=1$. Let $F(z)$ be the integral I wrote above. Then $C$\nis determined from the boundary correspondence: $C\\=1/F(1\\)$. Now \n$$G(z)\\=(\\-\\\\cos(\\\\pi z)\\+1\\)/2$$\nmaps the rectangular half\\-strip onto the upper half\\-plane, $(0,1,\\\\infty)\\\\mapsto (0,1,\\\\infty)$. Therefore \n$$H(z)\\=F(G(z))/F(1\\)$$\nmaps the upper half of the rectilinear strip on the upper half of the slanted strip (both with $T\\=1$). So the solution of the Dirichlet problem (with $T\\=1$) is \n$$\\\\Re(H^{\\-1}(z)).$$\nNot very explicit, of course, since one has to invert the integral $F$. But OK for numerical computation.\n\nRemark 2\\. The integral \n$$B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta):\\=\\\\int\\_0^x\\\\zeta^{\\\\beta\\-1}(1\\-\\\\zeta)^{\\-\\\\beta}d\\\\zeta$$\nis called the incomplete Beta\\-function, and there is even the standard notation\n$$I\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta):\\=\\\\frac{B\\_x(\\\\beta,\\-\\\\beta)}{B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)}\\=F(x)/F(1\\).$$\nTo obtain simple estimates, expand it to the power series:\n$$B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\=\\\\beta^{\\-1}x^\\\\beta\\+\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{\\\\beta(\\\\beta\\+1\\)\\\\ldots(\\\\beta\\+n\\-1\\)}{n!(n\\+\\\\beta)}x^{n\\+\\\\beta}.$$\nThis is sufficient to determine your function on $(0,c)$ with any desired accuracy, unless $c$ is close to $1$. Near $1$ use a similar expansion\ninto powers of $x\\-1$.\n\nFor example, near $0$, $G(x)\\\\sim x^2/4,$ so $$H(x)\\\\sim\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta 4^{\\\\beta}B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)}x^{2\\\\beta},$$\n$H^{\\-1}(x)\\\\sim Cx^{1/(2\\\\beta)}.$ Also notice that the series for $B\\_x$ has\npositive coefficients which simplifies the estimates.\n\nTo obtain a lower estimate, you need the upper estimate to $B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)$. We can write it as\n$$B(x):\\=B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\=\\\\beta^{\\-1}x^\\\\beta\\+f(x),$$\nwhere $f$ is increasing (because it is a power series with positive coefficients), and we also know that $B(1\\)\\=B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta),$ therefore\n$f(x)\\<f(1\\)\\=B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\-1/\\\\beta$.

Usually, when a door is installed, the opening is 1/2 \\- 1\" wider than the door casing so there's plenty of room to get the frame nice and square in the opening.

They may have been covered with wood putty before the frame was painted, so they may not be very obvious.\n\nIf it was nailed into place, the nails may be slowly slipping out of place, but the heads are remaining buried under the putty. As you pull the frame back straight, it may actually pop the nail through. This will be obvious, and you only need to hammer it back in, then use a nail\\-set to get it below flush.

The issue is likely caused by the mini-split units operating at low cooling loads during humid weather. Modern mini-splits modulate their cooling output, which can result in the coils not getting cool enough to adequately condense moisture from the air. This leads to high humidity in the room and potential odor issues.\n\nThe recommended solution, as mentioned in the top answer, is to switch the unit to \"dry\" mode.

The value of the resistor should be the same order of magnitude as the thermistor. For example, I\u2019m using a 10K \u03a9 thermistor, so the resistor should be 10K \u03a9 as well.

Its resistance changes with temperature. There's an equation that describes that, but I'm not going to go into it here.\n\nYou know the input voltage (5V,) the output voltage (measured by A0,) and R2 (10k.) From that you can calculate the resistance of the thermistor and from there you can calculate the temperature.\n\n---\n\nVoltage dividers are basic things. You should understand them and what they are \\- as well as what they aren't. They aren't (as many people seem to think) a suitable substiture for a voltage regulator.\n\nThe picture you put in your question is not a schematic. It is a wiring diagram. Many times, problems understanding how circuits work come from trying to use a wiring diagram (which is just instructions on how to connect things) instead of a using a schematic diagram (which is intended to show the function.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A voltage divider circuit is constructed using a 10k\u03a9 thermistor and a fixed resistor. The circuit is connected to a 5V power source. When the temperature changes, causing the thermistor's resistance to increase to 15k\u03a9, what will be the approximate output voltage (Vout) measured at the midpoint of the divider?\n\nA) 2.0V\nB) 2.5V\nC) 3.0V\nD) 3.5V\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe voltage divider equation is Vout = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) * Vin\nWhere R1 is the thermistor (15k\u03a9), R2 is the fixed resistor (10k\u03a9), and Vin is 5V.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nVout = (10k\u03a9 / (15k\u03a9 + 10k\u03a9)) * 5V\n     = (10 / 25) * 5V\n     = 0.4 * 5V\n     = 2.0V\n\nHowever, this is the voltage across the fixed resistor. The output voltage we're interested in is measured from the midpoint to ground, which is the voltage across the thermistor:\n\nVout = 5V - 2.0V = 3.0V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 3.0V."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/12", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/30073", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/5185/"], "docs_id": 30073, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have 2 video cards, one On board, a `nVidia 6150SE nForce 430` and a PCIe `nVidia GeForce GT 220 1GB DDR2 RAM`\n\nI have already configured the PCIe card to use the dual monitor feature, using the VGA and HDMI ports, but now I want to add a third monitor, using the On board VGA port\n\nI have managed to enable the On board graphics processor, which is taking 400MB of ram, but I cant manage to use it, `nvidia-settings` does not detect it, like it's not usable (but is there)\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1.

Serial ports are still useful \\-\\- much more so than parallel ports. But the thing is, the SAME chip controls both, so the question becomes \"why not?\" Both of the motherboards you linked to also have a serial port on them.\n\nSecondly, a USB\\<\\-\\>Parallel adapter takes the simplest of interfaces and makes it way more complicated than it should be. Any time I encounter one of these adapters, I wind up spending more time getting the stupid adapter to work than I do getting the device that plugs into it to work. Sometimes there's just no substitute for having an actual, physical parallel port.\n\nThere are several other reasons why the good old parallel port can still be found on modern computers. I myself have witnessed the following with my own two eyes:\n\n* [Software protection dongles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_protection_dongle). There are still many old and esoteric scientific/engineering applications in use that use the parallel port for their anti\\-piracy dongles. One I saw recently was for calculating mineral densities from the sample data taken from a gas spectrometer. No need to update an app like that because all it does is a single, very specific kind of math problem. It does, however, benefit from running on a faster computer than the ones available when it was written, and the dongle lets you replace the computer with ease.\n* Heavy industrial equipment interfaces. Think computerized textile looms, assembly line robots, parcel sorting machines, etc. These devices have a service life of decades \\-\\- much longer than the computer that controls them could be expected to last. Many of them have been in use since the 1980's when parallel ports were not only common; they were the fastest connection available at the time. I recently saw one being used by a plasma cutter making custom ducting for an HVAC supplier.\n* My son is in the Boy Scouts. At their annual Pinewood Derby races, his troop has a track that records the race times over a parallel port and flags the winner from each round.\n* Old large format/high\\-capacity printers. Some of these things are 20 years old and still going strong. They even still make parts for them.\n* Some business are still using old Nortel PBX systems for their phones. In the one I saw a couple years ago, a parallel port connected the PBX to the voice mail server. It also used a WYSE dumb terminal to program it, which I was unable to figure out.\n\nThese are just the ones I've seen. Remember that computers aren't just for playing games and goofing around on the Internet. Some of them are built to get work done, and parallel ports often come in handy for that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is upgrading their computer systems but needs to maintain compatibility with some legacy industrial equipment.

As mentioned in the documentation, the cost of adding a parallel port to a motherboard that already includes a serial port is practically non-existent, as the same chip controls both. This allows manufacturers to include parallel ports without significantly increasing costs, while providing compatibility with older systems still in use in industrial settings. Many pieces of industrial equipment, such as computerized textile looms or assembly line robots, have service lives of decades and may still rely on parallel port connections.

Right now, I've managed to change rifle.conf so that when I play audio or video from Ranger, mpv opens in a new xterm window and the media starts to play.\n\nHowever, if possible, I would like Ranger to open the gnome\\-terminal instead of xterm. In `/.config/ranger/rifle.conf`, it says that using the `t` flag will run the program in a new terminal:\n\n`If $TERMCMD is not defined, rifle will attempt to extract it from $TERM`\n\nI tried setting `$TERMCMD` in both my .profile and .bashrc files, but even though `echo $TERMCMD` would print \"gnome\\-terminal\", Ranger would still open xterm. I also messed with setting `$TERM` to \"gnome\\-terminal\", but that was messy and I decided to leave it alone.\n\nAny suggestions? Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As of 2017, the source\\-code ([runner.py](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/core/runner.py#L197)) did this:\n\n```\n        term = os.environ.get('TERMCMD', os.environ.get('TERM'))\n        if term not in get_executables():\n            term = 'x-terminal-emulator'\n        if term not in get_executables():\n            term = 'xterm'\n        if isinstance(action, str):\n            action = term + ' -e ' + action\n        else:\n            action = [term, '-e'] + action\n\n```\n\nso you should be able to put any xterm\\-compatible program name in `TERMCMD`. However, note the use of `-e` (gnome\\-terminal doesn't match xterm's behavior). If you are using Debian/Ubuntu/etc, the Debian packagers have attempted to provide a wrapper to hide this difference in the `x-terminal-emulator` feature. If that applies to you, you could set `TERMCMD` to `x-terminal-emulator`.\n\nFollowup \\- while the design of the `TERMCMD` feature has not changed appreciably since mid\\-2016, the location within the source has changed:\n\n* [Refactor and improve the TERMCMD handling](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/commit/058a7ebe563e4c30ff9bd15b2861c1f86df7d23b#diff-cc5478eddc22308e8e4a50aff879aa80)  moved it to [ranger/ext/get\\_executables.py](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/commit/058a7ebe563e4c30ff9bd15b2861c1f86df7d23b#diff-c8ac4efefa619d12259dc51df3baa984)\n\nThat is implemented in [`get_term`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/1687e0f41f172cef6923f75f4c6f1038f19671dc/ranger/ext/get_executables.py#L53):\n\n```\ndef get_term():\n    \"\"\"Get the user terminal executable name.\n    Either $TERMCMD, $TERM, \"x-terminal-emulator\" or \"xterm\", in this order.\n    \"\"\"\n    command = environ.get('TERMCMD', environ.get('TERM'))\n    if shlex.split(command)[0] not in get_executables():\n        command = 'x-terminal-emulator'\n        if command not in get_executables():\n            command = 'xterm'\n    return command\n\n```\n\nwhich uses `x-terminal-emulator` as before.\n\nThere is a *related* use of `TERMCMD` in [`rifle.py`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/720e3fd798caa2f8bfd0a19fd9ed5c0eab5dd14c/ranger/ext/rifle.py#L357), used for executing commands rather than (as asked in the question) for opening a terminal. Either way, the key to using ranger is `x-terminal-emulator`, since GNOME Terminal's developers do not document their command\\-line interface, while Debian developers have provided this workaround.\n\nQuoting from [Bug 701691 \u2013 \\-e accepts only one term; all other terminal emulators accept more than one term](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=701691) (which the developer refused to fix, marking it \"not a bug\"):\n\n> Christian Persch 2013\\-06\\-06 16:02:54 UTC\n> \n> \n> There are no docs for the gnome\\-terminal command line options."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user wants to configure Ranger file manager to open media files in GNOME Terminal instead of xterm.

Does \"rain or not\" effect this association? I used `loglm()` from `MASS` for this:\n\n```\n # Are species independent to host plants, given the effect of rain?\nloglm(~species + host + rain + species*rain + host*rain, data=my.table)\n\n # Given any relationship between host plants and species, does rain change it?\nloglm(~species + host + rain + species*host)\n\n```\n\nThis is a little outside my comfort level, and I wanted to check that I'd set the models up right and that this was the best way to approach these questions. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two ways to interpret your first question, which are reflected in the two ways you asked it: \u201cAre species associated with host plants?\u201d and, \u201cAre species independent to host plants, given the effect of rain?\u201d \n\nThe first interpretation corresponds to a model of *joint independence*, which states that species and hosts are dependent, but jointly independent of whether it rained:\n\n$\\\\quad p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_{sh} p\\_r$\n\nwhere $p\\_{shr}$ is the probability that an observation falls into the $(s,h,r)$ cell where $s$ indexes species, $h$ host type, and $r$ rain value, $p\\_{sh}$ is the marginal probability of the $(s,h,\\\\cdot)$ cell where we collapse over the rain variable, and $p\\_r$ is the marginal probability of rain. \n\nThe second interpretation corresponds to a model of *conditional independence*, which states that species and hosts are independent given whether it rained:\n\n$\\\\quad p\\_{sh\\|r} \\= p\\_{s\\|r}p\\_{h\\|r}$ or $p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_{sr}p\\_{hr} / p\\_r$\n\nwhere $p\\_{sh\\|r}$ is the conditional probability of the $(s,h,r)$ cell, given a value of $r$.\n\nYou can test these models in R (`loglin` would work fine too but I\u2019m more familiar with `glm`):\n\n```\ncount <- c(12,15,10,13,11,12,12,7)\nspecies <- rep(c(\"a\", \"b\"), 4)\nhost <- rep(c(\"c\",\"c\", \"d\", \"d\"), 2)\nrain <- c(rep(0,4), rep(1,4))\nmy.table <- xtabs(count ~ host + species + rain)\nmy.data <- as.data.frame.table(my.table)\nmod0 <- glm(Freq ~ species + host + rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod1 <- glm(Freq ~ species * host + rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod2 <- glm(Freq ~ (species + host) * rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nanova(mod0, mod1, test=\"Chi\") #Test of joint independence\nanova(mod0, mod2, test=\"Chi\") #Test of conditional independence\n\n```\n\nAbove, `mod1` corresponds to joint independence and `mod2` corresponds to conditional independence, whereas `mod0` corresponds to a *mutual independence* model $p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_s p\\_h p\\_r$. You can see the parameter estimates using `summary(mod2)`, etc. As usual, you should check to see if model assumptions are met. In the data you provided, the null model actually fits adequately. \n\nA different way of approaching your first question would be to perform Fischer\u2019s exact test (`fisher.test(xtabs(count ~ host + species))`) on the collapsed 2x2 table (first interpretation) or the Mantel\\-Haenszel test (`mantelhaen.test(xtabs(count ~ host + species + rain))`) for 2\\-stratified 2x2 tables or to write a permutation test that respects the stratification (second interpretation). \n\nTo paraphrase your second question, *Does the relationship between species and host depend on whether it rained?*\n\n```\nmod3 <- glm(Freq ~ species*host*rain - species:host:rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod4 <- glm(Freq ~ species*host*rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nanova(mod3, mod4, test=\u201dChi\u201d)\npchisq(deviance(mod3), df.residual(mod3), lower=F)\n\n```\n\nThe full model `mod4` is saturated, but you can test the effect in question by looking at the deviance of `mod3` as I've done above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An ecologist is analyzing data on insect species collected from different host plants under various weather conditions.

This model allows us to examine if the relationship between species and host depends on the rain condition.\n\nOption A uses loglm() which can be used for log-linear models, but it doesn't include the three-way interaction necessary for this question.\n\nOption B only includes a two-way interaction between species and host, and doesn't consider how rain might affect this relationship.\n\nOption C uses Fisher's exact test on a collapsed 2x2 table, which doesn't account for the rain variable at all and is not suitable for this three-way analysis.\n\nThe correct approach (Option D) fits a model that includes all two-way interactions and tests against a saturated model to determine if the three-way interaction is significant, directly addressing the question of whether rain affects the species-host relationship."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/10/22", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/77347", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/13496/"], "docs_id": 77347, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've got a site that was hosted on a linux el cheapo hosting service that I'm migrating to my Mac OS X 10\\.5 Leopard Server server running Apache 2\\.2\\.8 \\& PHP 5\\.2\\.5 w/rewrite\\_module enabled and `AllowOverride All`, but I'm running into an issue with the following lines in the `.htaccess` file:\n\n```\nRewriteEngine On\n#RewriteRule ^view/([^/\\.]+)/?$ /view.php?item=$1 [L]\n#RewriteRule ^order/([^/\\.]+)/?$ /order.php?item=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^category/([^/\\.]+)/?$ /category.php?category=$1 [L]\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, I've commented out the `RewriteRule` directives for `/view/` and `/order/`, so I'm only dealing with `/category/`.

Is that normal, and should I be concerned?\n\nLong Version:\nIn the picture is a white 14/3 wire running parallel and very close to a black 14/2 wire. They travel closely for about 8 feet to the crawl space below.\n\nThe white one used to be jumped off of the black wire in the box above this picture (but out of frame), but It is now wired only to a 3\\-way switch in that box. In the crawl space it is dead\\-ended in a junction box.\n\nI was going to use it to operate a different light that hadn't been on a 3\\-way switch before by reconnecting it at that crawl\\-space junction box.\n\nHowever, it is showing a current despite no known connection to a circuit. Is it possible that running so close to the live black wire makes it look like it has a current? And is it safe to use it as is, or should I crack into the wall more to separate them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Voltage and Current are 2 very different things. Voltage is like pressure in a water line, current is the flow rate. A tiny 1/4\" at high pressure isn't going to flow a lot of water, a fire hydrant at relatively low pressure will flow A LOT!\n\nNow, getting to your issue: You probably have an induced current , that's how transformers work. All you can do is put a load (like and old style incandescent bulb) on it and see if the power goes away. The non\\-contact testers or even the modern multi\\-meters are so sensitive they'll detect almost anything. If you don't feel safe working on the circuit, you'll have to turn off the breaker to the other cable as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a white 14/3 wire that shows a current reading despite not being connected to a power source. The wire runs parallel and close to a live black 14/2 wire for about 8 feet. What is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon, and what should the electrician do to safely work on this circuit?\n\nA) The white wire has a short circuit and needs immediate replacement.\nB) The current reading is due to electromagnetic induction, and the electrician should use an incandescent bulb to test for actual power flow.\nC) The non-contact tester is faulty and needs to be recalibrated before further use.\nD) The white wire has residual charge and will discharge on its own over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation is electromagnetic induction from the nearby live black wire. To safely work on the circuit and determine if there's actual power flow, the electrician should use an incandescent bulb as a load. If the bulb doesn't light up, it confirms that the current reading is just induced and not a real power source. If there are safety concerns, the electrician should turn off the breaker for both cables before working on them. This approach addresses the phenomenon of induced current and provides a practical safety measure for working on the circuit."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/28", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/55721", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/18584/"], "docs_id": 55721, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm reading Lawrence Block's memoir, in which he writes about his experience of living in a very nice inn in Spain with his wife.

As TRomano observes, the keys worn by the innkeeper on his belt at one time signaled his sexual predilections to those in the know\u2014worn on the left they designated a \"top\", one who took a more active role, worn on the right a \"bottom\", one who took a more passive role.[source](https://books.google.com/books?id=hafi17WHyzAC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=keys+homosexual+signal&source=bl&ots=pQgBOjTvO3&sig=WDGXCRTTuMVBsBPRJC415jzh3kI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=USZAVeLcCYmNsAXBoYCoDg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=keys%20homosexual%20signal&f=false)\n2. As FumbleFingers points out, Block's line quotes an old ad for Salem cigarettes, which is itself based on the template Axelrod cites. Probably the best\\-known version of the template, and perhaps its origin\u2020, is \"You can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy\".\n3. Lawrence Block has lived in the \"West Village\" (a part of New York City's Greenwich Village) for decades. At the time he settled there it was the \"bohemian\" district of the city, famous for its jazz and comedy clubs, and one of the centers of the not\\-very\\-far\\-underground homosexual culture\u2014Christopher Street and the Stonewall Inn are located there.\n\nSo Block is observing, with a touch of exasperation, that even across the Atlantic in Spain he cannot entirely escape the culture of his own stomping grounds. *How do we do it?* just means \"How is it that we always manage to get ourselves in this situation?\"\n\n\u2020 The earliest use I have found is in [*The M. K. \\& T. Employes' Magazine*](https://books.google.com/books?id=BgE9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA105&dq=%22you+can+take+the+boy+out+of%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eShAVbinM8vZtQW_t4C4Ag&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22you%20can%20take%20the%20boy%20out%20of%22&f=false) for March, 1917, where it is described as an 'old saying'."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Lawrence Block's memoir, he uses the phrase \"I guess you can take us out of the West Village, but you can't take the country out of Salem.\" What does this statement most likely imply about the author and his wife?\n\nA) They are unable to forget their rural upbringing in Salem, Massachusetts.\nB) They are nostalgic for their time living in Salem, Oregon.\nC) They cannot escape their ingrained perceptions and cultural awareness from living in New York's West Village.\nD) They are comparing the inn in Spain to Salem's witch trials history.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The phrase is a play on the common saying \"You can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy.\" Block adapts this to reference the West Village, a part of New York City known for its bohemian and gay culture. By mentioning Salem (likely referring to Salem cigarettes' slogan), he's using wordplay to express that even in Spain, he and his wife can't shake off their familiarity with and awareness of gay culture from their time living in the West Village. This interpretation is supported by their immediate recognition of potential gay signaling (the keys) and their conversation about it, showing that their West Village experiences have shaped their perceptions and observations, even in a foreign country."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/13", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/34253182", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4727468/"], "docs_id": 34253182, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My app has a number of wordLists each of which contain a number of words.

This is not the best fit for the question's emphasis on speaking style.\n\nC) Brisk manner of speaking: This is the correct answer as it directly addresses the style of speaking described in the question. \"Brisk\" implies quick and energetic delivery, and \"manner of speaking\" focuses on the style rather than the content.\n\nD) Soliloquy: This term refers to a dramatic device where a character speaks their thoughts aloud, usually alone on stage.

When the peripheral device is connected directly, there is no problem. Hoever, when I use a dock extension cable, a strange harmonic noise is introduced. I have tried extension cables from different manufacturers, and even the highly rated dockXtender extension cable made by CableJive introduces the noise. \n\nThis is somewhat strange as the analogue\\-to\\-digital (bear with my British English) converter is built into the peripheral device. This is not analogue noise picked up in the cable as the signal is pure digital on route to the iPhone. The noise seems to be introduced in the digital domain. I recorded a sample of audio in my office and analysed it using Matlab. The noise fluctuates in amplitude, but it is clearly a harmonic complex with a very precise 1\\-kHz fundamental frequency. The ADC reportedly samples at 44\\.1 kHz, so it is particularly strange that the harmonic noise comes in with a periodicity that is not even an intiger multiple of the sampling period. As a side note, I have heard a similar harmonic noise in the past emitted from some laptop sound cards (specifically Vaio C1s models).\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuOas.png)\n\nGiven that the noise never fluctuates in frequency, testing has shown that I can remedy the problem by pre\\-processing with a fractional delay filter based on the information here . . . \n[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs\\_all.jsp?arnumber\\=951433](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=951433)\n. . . but this is a computationally expensive filter to implement.\n\nPrevention is better than cure. My question is, what is the origin of this strange harmonic noise and if possible, how do I remedy it so that I do not have to waste processing power implementing an additional filter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you are picking up is EMI from [USB frame sync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus) (most probably through the ground wire):\n\n> Every millisecond (12000 full\\-bandwidth bit times), the USB host transmits a special SOF (start of frame) token, containing an 11\\-bit incrementing frame number in place of a device address. This is used to synchronize isochronous data flows. High\\-bandwidth USB 2\\.0 devices receive 7 additional duplicate SOF tokens per frame, each introducing a 125 \u00b5s \"microframe\" (60000 high\\-bandwidth bit times each).\n> \n> \n> USB 2\\.0 added a PING token, which asks a device if it is ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate. This avoids the need to send the DATA packet if the device knows that it will just respond with NAK.\n\nThis could be avoided with a properly shielded extension cable. Note that even [dockXtender only shields some of the wires](http://www.cablejive.com/products/dockXtender.html):\n\n> A revolutionary 2\\-tier shielding system puts all video and audio signals inside a separate shielding to reduce interference from the other signals traveling through the wire.\n\nIf you're the DIY type of person it should be quite easy to make your own extension cable using high quality shielded wires. You will probably only need to connect just a few of the [30 pins](http://pinouts.ru/CellularPhones-A-N/iPhone_connector_pinout.shtml): USB (power, gnd, data\\+/\\-), all GNDs and maybe accessory/serial (enable, rx/tx). Make sure you also shield the soldering on the connector."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio engineer is experiencing harmonic noise when using a Tascam iM2 stereo mic connected to an iPhone 4S via a dock extension cable. The noise has a 1-kHz fundamental frequency and persists across different extension cables. What is the most likely cause of this noise, and what would be the most effective solution?\n\nA) The noise is caused by a faulty analog-to-digital converter in the microphone. Replacing the microphone would solve the issue.\n\nB) The noise is due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) from USB frame sync, likely coupled through the ground wire. Using a properly shielded extension cable would mitigate the problem.\n\nC) The noise is a result of software incompatibility between the iPhone and the microphone. Updating the iPhone's operating system would resolve the issue.\n\nD) The noise is caused by the iPhone's internal clock. Implementing a fractional delay filter in software is the only solution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that the noise is likely caused by EMI from USB frame sync, which occurs at regular intervals (every millisecond). This matches the described 1-kHz fundamental frequency of the noise. The noise is introduced when using extension cables, suggesting an issue with shielding. The most effective solution would be to use a properly shielded extension cable, which would prevent the EMI from affecting the audio signal. While a fractional delay filter could help (as mentioned in the original post), it's not addressing the root cause and is computationally expensive.

This change of variable allows us to rewrite the expression in a form that's closer to the definition of a derivative. Through algebraic manipulation and application of limit properties, we can split the expression into two parts, each of which converges to f'(a)/2. When these are added together, the result is f'(a).\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Substituting c = 2h\n2. Rewriting the numerator by adding and subtracting f(a)\n3. Splitting the limit into two parts\n4. Recognizing each part as half of the definition of f'(a)\n5.

It first gets the index of the field using indexOf() and then uses that index to retrieve unique values with uniqueValues().\nOption C, while it would work, is not the most efficient method as it iterates through all features. It's also not using the QGIS API's built-in functionality for this purpose.\nOption D is incorrect because it uses fieldNameIndex() (which is deprecated in newer versions of QGIS) and distinctValues() (which is not a standard QGIS method).\n\nThe correct approach uses the QGIS API's built-in methods to efficiently retrieve unique values for a specific field, making it the best solution for this task."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/26", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/461759", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/172949/"], "docs_id": 461759, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I already achieved 60 files in Overleaf inside my project which is the limit.

Option A is possible but not the most efficient. Option B is incorrect as it refers to an outdated practice for Overleaf v1, which has been retired. Option D is a valid method but requires more technical knowledge and setup.\n\nThe correct answer is C because Overleaf v2 has a much higher file limit (2000 files) compared to v1 (60 files).

The scenario is as follows:\nConsider, at a junction, there is a traffic signal, having red, yellow and green lights respectively. There are vehicles facing the traffic signal post. When it shows red, the vehicles stop, when it shows green, the vehicles move on. In case, it is yellow, the driver must decide whether to go or to stop, depending on whether he/she has crossed the stop line or not. At the same time, there are vehicles that do not care about the signal. They would do as they like.\n\nThe similarities are that, the Traffic Signal happens to be the subject, notifying its states by glowing the appropriate lights. Those looking at it and following the signal are the ones subscribed to it, and behave according to the state of the subject. Those who do not care about it, are sort\\-of un\\-subscribed from the traffic signal.\n\nPlease tell me, if you think this is a correct analogy or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The analogy will work, but you added more complication such as what to do at yellow light.\n\nA simpler way is to only have green and red light; the traffic light would indicate two state changes:\n\n* red to green: traffic can go.\n* green to red: traffic must stop.\n\nNote that actions that should take place as a result of this state change does not concern the observed subject (i.e. the traffic light doesn't make a car stop).\n\nWithout the subscription, interested parties would have to continuously poll the traffic light state. Therefore, those 'who are not interested' can be left out of the analogy as they're not important."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Observer Pattern, which of the following best describes the role of the traffic light in the given analogy?\n\nA) The traffic light is an observer that monitors the flow of traffic and changes its state accordingly.\n\nB) The traffic light is a subject that notifies its state changes to subscribed vehicles, while vehicles that don't follow the signals are considered unsubscribed.\n\nC) The traffic light is both a subject and an observer, as it observes traffic conditions and notifies vehicles of its state.\n\nD) The traffic light is irrelevant to the Observer Pattern analogy, as it doesn't actively push notifications to vehicles.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The traffic light in this analogy serves as the subject in the Observer Pattern. It notifies its state changes (red, yellow, green) to the subscribed observers (vehicles that follow the signals). The vehicles that don't care about the signal are effectively unsubscribed from the subject. This aligns with the core concept of the Observer Pattern, where a subject maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes. The traffic light doesn't observe traffic conditions (ruling out A and C), and it is indeed relevant to the analogy (ruling out D). The correct answer, B, accurately describes the traffic light's role as the subject in this Observer Pattern analogy."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/02/19", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39985", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/131485/"], "docs_id": 39985, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **Possible Duplicate:**  \n> \n> [Full contact moderating](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/35864/full-contact-moderating)\n\nIs getting a bad/poor question off the main page so important that it's worth closing a question even before it can be answered?
