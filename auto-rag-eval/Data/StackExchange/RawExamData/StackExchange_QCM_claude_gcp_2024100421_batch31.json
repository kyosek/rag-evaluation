The current command is:\n\n`rsync -avp -e ssh /folder user@server:/backups/2 --link-dest=../1`\n\nThe process is often killed before completion due to time constraints.

Adding the --delay-updates parameter to the rsync command causes rsync to build a list of all changes first, then create all the hard links and folders before beginning the data transfer. This ensures that even if the process is interrupted, the hard links will have been created, potentially reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred in subsequent attempts.

Or it will remain stuck forever?`  \n\n`Is Gravity continuous, that holds the object in equilibrium state?`  \n\n`Will the small object act as a medium to attract both masses that will make them revolve around the smaller one?`\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are working in Newtonian gravity (I assume you are, seeing the tag) and therefore you neglect all relativistic/quantum effects, then **the central mass will stay in the same spot** if placed exactly in the center of mass of the system.\n\nThe two bigger masses will be attracted towards the center by the small mass and the other big mass (and nothing stops them) while the small mass will be pulled in two opposite directions with the same magnitude, therefore (since the gravitational force, same as any force, is a vector) the two will cancel out.  \n\nFor the conservation of angular momentum, if the system isn't rotating at the beginning it will continue to not rotate, and the movement will be completely linear along the axis passing through the center of the bodies.  \n\nAs for the \"is gravity continuous\", it certainly is in Newtonian gravity, as well as in General Relativity (the best we can nowadays do to explain gravity). However, the question in a Quantum\\-Gravity environment is far from obvious: we just don't know.\n\nBonus: you can generalize this question with different, moving masses. It's the [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) problem and the point you're asking about is [L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L1) that can be found (numerically in general, analytically with some assumptions)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small spherical object of mass m is placed exactly at the midpoint between two larger identical spherical objects, each of mass M, in empty space.

These forces cancel out, leaving the small mass stationary. However, each larger mass experiences a net gravitational force towards the center due to the attraction from both the small mass and the other large mass. As a result, the two larger masses will move towards the center while the small mass remains stationary. This situation is analogous to the Lagrange point L1 in a three-body system.

There is a basic point that I don't understand about conduction and the band structure. Unfortunately, my knowledge of solid state physics is minimal.\n\nThe energy spectrum for the SSH model consists of two bands. For various staggered hopping amplitudes the following band structures are depicted.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TuQjJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TuQjJ.png)\n\nWhy are the positive energy states associated with a \"conduction band\"? Don't states in the negative energy \"valence band\" still have nonzero wavenumber and thus momentum? Is there some operator I can associate with the transport of charges that has nonzero expectation value only on the upper band?\n\nAny insight or additional references regarding this would be useful.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will just talk about conduction and valence bands in general here, since it really seems that is what your question aims at (though I may be mistaken!). Let's just talk in one dimensional terms. In a metal, the conduction band is only partially full. With no electric field applied, there are just as many electrons moving in the positive x direction as in the negative x direction. There is no net conduction of electrons in either direction.\n\nBeing only partially filled, though, this means that empty states are available to be occupied *with just a small increase in energy*.\n\nSo if you apply an electric field, for example, pointing in the positive x direction, you can shift the distribution of electrons so that slightly more now occupy states moving in the direction of the electric field, and slightly less are moving in the direction opposite to the electric field. You have a net motion of electrons in the direction of the electric field. (Of course, scattering of the electrons with lattice vibrations and impurities will mean that a new equilibrium is reached and maintained with this shifted distribution.)\n\nIn the valence band, there are no empty states available for the electrons that are only a small amount of energy away. There is only a large energy gap between the valence and conduction band.\n\nNow, to understand the following you will probably have to learn a little more about solid state physics. Electrons do begin moving in the valence band, but when an electron reaches what is called a Brillouin zone boundary, it is Bragg reflected across the zone and essentially ends up moving in the opposite direction. So in the valence band, there are always an equal number of electrons moving in both directions. There is no increase in the number of electrons moving in the direction of the electric field.\n\nIt is as if you were sliding electron states along the valence band and as you begin to make an empty state at one end of the Brillouin zone, an electron from the opposite end jumps into it. All the state remained filled all the time. No net conduction in the direction of the electric field.\n\nThe quantum operator that represents current is: $$\\\\vec J\\= \\\\frac{e \\\\hbar}{2im}(\\\\psi^\\*\\\\nabla \\\\psi \\- \\\\psi \\\\nabla\\\\psi^\\*)$$\n\nBut this operator is not used since $\\\\psi$ here is the full many electron wave function for the conduction band. Most transport in solid state physics is studied in a semi\\-classical way using the Boltzmann equation. I have seen the expectation value of a slightly modified form of the above operator used to derive the London equation in superconductivity. The modified form includes the vector potential $\\\\vec A$.\n\nHope this helps."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In solid state physics, which of the following best explains why the valence band does not contribute significantly to electrical conduction in a semiconductor or insulator, even though electrons in this band have nonzero momentum?\n\nA) Electrons in the valence band have insufficient energy to overcome the work function of the material.\n\nB) The valence band is completely empty, so there are no electrons available for conduction.\n\nC) Electrons in the valence band experience Bragg reflection at Brillouin zone boundaries, resulting in no net directional movement.\n\nD) The quantum operator for current has zero expectation value for all states in the valence band.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the valence band, electrons do have nonzero momentum and can move. However, when an electron reaches a Brillouin zone boundary, it undergoes Bragg reflection. This reflection causes the electron to effectively move in the opposite direction, maintaining an equal number of electrons moving in both directions at all times. As a result, there is no net conduction in response to an applied electric field.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the work function relates to electron emission from a material's surface, not internal conduction.\n\nAnswer B is false; the valence band is typically full or nearly full of electrons in semiconductors and insulators.\n\nAnswer D is not accurate. While the quantum operator for current is relevant to conduction, it's not typically used in this context, and its expectation value isn't necessarily zero for all valence band states."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/16", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/192915", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/115394/"], "docs_id": 192915, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUCix.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUCix.jpg)\n\nI need to shut valve to fix bathrooms ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6NL1.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This appears to be the plumbing for your water heater \\- as such, while there are shutoff valves for the cold *into the heater* and the hot *out of the heater*, the cold running to your various fixtures (and to here \\- the main water shutoff) is *almost certainly* somewhere else.\n\nThe water shutoff valves here are the red and blue metal handles that are shaped somewhat like:\n\n```\n-\\_/-\n\n```\n\nTurn them 90 dgrees so the handles are out of line with the pipes they are on, not in line with them to shut off \\- reverse to turn on. \n\nCheck your water heater manual to see if you need to shut it down before turning the water off.

Partially immerse the cylinder at some angle in the liquid (of density $\\\\rho$) so that the height of liquid above the piston is $h$. If the liquid pushes with pressure $p$ on the piston, then if we push the piston outwards through a small distance $\\\\Delta s$, the liquid level rises because a volume $A \\\\Delta s$ of liquid is effectively displaced upwards through a height $h$.

From a computational point of view, the organisms employ a common programming (DNA, RNA, etc.) and runtime environment (cell biology). This evolution has eventually evolved a more powerful ((in a restricted sense) computational environment, the hierarchy of biological brains, with the currently most powerful class instance being the human brain. A collection of human brains is now working on evolving a quantum computer. Perhaps one day the the quantum computers will produce a....\n\nFrom an anthropic point of view, we are here to think about these things, because our universe creates environments such as our planet earth, which support the evolution of life. \n\nSo my question is whether there is a general physical and computational principle at work here, demonstrated by the following incomplete, in parts almost surely incorrect, and highly speculative hierarchical chain of evolution:\n\n1. Within the Multiverse, universes are instantiated following particular physical laws originated and adapted from their embedding universe\n2. Each instantiated embedded universe follows computational rules (the particular physical laws of this universe) and create a finite number of embedded universes (the only candidate seems to be for singularities of black holes to correspond with a white\\-hole, inflationary, embedded universe), each of which evolve in the same general manner\n3. Each universe produces a finite number of computational schemes to build organisms that follow certain classes of program patters. These organism evolve according to the theory of biological evolution.\n4. Biological organisms evolve biological brains, a higher class computational scheme\n5. biological brains build computational devices, which at some point attain the property of replication\n6. The replicating computational devices build higher classes of computational devices, following the general principle of evolution...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is the fecund universe idea, due to Smolin. The original form assumed that a new universe formed every time a black hole appeared (as a sink for the information loss that relativists believed in back then), and then the universe is tuned to maximize the number of black holes formed, constrained by the condition that life is possible.\n\nThese types of ideas are anthropic, and they are hard to make testable. Even if the universe is replicating itself and changing, it is not life. Life is not about replication. Fire replicates itself, and tries to maximize cumbustible consumption. Fire isn't life.\n\nLife is when you have a computer in nature. That's not the case for universe\\-forming processes, because the universe is just not that complicated on the elementary scale. You can see the universe wasn't designed, and evolution and design are synonyms. All design is a process of evolution in your head, and all evolution in a complex system can be equally well called a process of design in a disembodied computational entity formed by all the evolving creatures.\n\nSince evolution is a property of complex systems, and there is no complex system here, just black hole formation from galaxies (this doesn't allow a universal computer), you don't have evolution as I see it. You just have, at best, something replicating, like fire.\n\nThe theory is also incorrect because black holes don't lose information, and don't make new universes. The current universe we are in is also not particularly tuned for black hole formation. Further, the measure which tells you how to maximize is not at all clear: should you maximize the total number of black holes the universe will ever form? Does it matter if they form early or late? What's the weight?

The answer states that \"Life is when you have a computer in nature,\" and argues that universe-forming processes are not complex enough to qualify as life or undergo evolution in the same way as biological systems.

I understand how to find the z\\-score and, in this case, not the standard deviation.\n\n> A cell phone provider has 85% of its customers rank their service as \"satisfactory.\u201d Nico takes a random sample of 75 customers from this cell phone provider. What is the probability that 83% or more of this sample ranks the provider\u2019s service as \"satisfactory\u201d?\n\n> A. 0\\.314\n>   \n> \n> B. 0\\.485\n>   \n> \n> C. 0\\.562\n>   \n> \n> D. 0\\.686\n\nMy guess with the observed value and mean value for the $z$\\-score equation would be to substitute $0\\.83$ for the former and 0\\.85 for the latter.\n\nFor the standard deviation, I believe I use the equation $\\\\sqrt{np (1\\-p)}$, substituting $0\\.85$ for $p$ and $75$ for $n$. However, when I found the calculation to be $\\\\approx 3\\.0923$, I thought it was higher than what I'm normally used to. And sure enough, when it was substituted into the $z$\\-score equation, the z\\-score was far too small. How do I find the correct answer? What methods were incorrect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's interpret an individual customer's statement of \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfactory\" as a random variable $X\\_i$ that is $1$ with probability $0\\.85$ and $0$ with probability $0\\.15$. Then, you are trying to get a close value for:\n\n$$\n\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\frac{1}{75}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{75} X\\_i \\\\geq 0\\.83\\) \\= \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{75} X\\_i \\\\geq 62\\.25\\).\n$$\n\nThe sum of the $X\\_i$ follows a binomial distribution $B(75,0\\.85\\)$ since each $X\\_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Since computing the exact probability of a binomial distribution may require a sum with many terms, it's easier to approximate with a normal distribution $\\\\mathcal{N}(75\\\\cdot 0\\.85,75\\\\cdot 0\\.85\\\\cdot 0\\.15\\)\\=\\\\mathcal{N}(63\\.75,9\\.5625\\)$.\n\nNow, the $z$\\-score of $62\\.25$ relative to this normal distribution is about $\\-0\\.1569$. The area to the right of this point in the standard normal distribution is about $0\\.56$. (Recall that the area to the right is what we are looking for since we are interested in satisfaction above the $0\\.83$ threshold)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A cell phone provider claims that 85% of its customers rate their service as \"satisfactory.\" You want to test this claim by taking a random sample of 100 customers. \n\nPart 1: What is the expected number of customers in your sample who would rate the service as \"satisfactory\"?\n\nPart 2: What is the standard deviation of the number of \"satisfactory\" ratings in your sample?\n\nPart 3: Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, what is the probability that 90 or more customers in your sample will rate the service as \"satisfactory\"?\n\nPart 4: Based on the result from Part 3, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) There is a very high likelihood of getting 90 or more \"satisfactory\" ratings, supporting the provider's claim.\nB) There is a moderate chance of getting 90 or more \"satisfactory\" ratings, neither strongly supporting nor refuting the provider's claim.\nC) There is a low probability of getting 90 or more \"satisfactory\" ratings, suggesting the provider's claim might be overstated.\nD) It is impossible to get 90 or more \"satisfactory\" ratings given the provider's claim.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nPart 1: Expected number = np = 100 * 0.85 = 85\nPart 2: Standard deviation = sqrt(np(1-p)) = sqrt(100 * 0.85 * 0.15) \u2248 3.57\nPart 3: Z-score for 90 = (90 - 85) / 3.57 \u2248 1.40\nProbability = 1 - \u03a6(1.40) \u2248 0.0808 or about 8.08%\n\nThis low probability (about 8%) suggests it's unlikely to get 90 or more \"satisfactory\" ratings if the provider's claim of 85% satisfaction is accurate.

First, you probably want to put selinux into permissive mode:\n\n```\nsetenforce 0\n\n```\n\nNow, log in and make sure your PAM configuration works as expected. We do this because there's a good chance that there may be *additional* selinux denials after the first one, and running in permissive mode will make sure they all get logged.\n\nNow you can put selinux back into enforcing mode:\n\n```\nsetenforce 1\n\n```\n\nRun `audit2allow -a`. This will generate something like the following:\n\n```\n#============= sshd_t ==============\n\n#!!!! This avc can be allowed using one of the these booleans:\n#     authlogin_yubikey, nis_enabled\nallow sshd_t http_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;\n\n```\n\nI say \"something like\" because (a) as I said earlier there may be additional denials related to your current PAM configuration and (b) this command looks at all entries in the audit log, so you get get results for previous denials that aren't actually related to your current issue.\n\nIn this case, we see that we can permit the action that was denied by setting an existing selinux boolean. That would look something like:\n\n```\nsetsebool nis_enabled=1\n\n```\n\nThat may be all that you need. Alternatively, you can generate an update to your selinux policy like this:\n\n```\naudit2allow -a -M local\n\n```\n\nThis will generate a new policy file `local.pp`. You can activate that by running:\n\n```\nsemodule -i local.pp\n\n```\n\nThere is some good information about working with selinux [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/sect-security-enhanced_linux-troubleshooting-fixing_problems), including a much more detailed overview of using `audit2allow`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are trying to remotely access a Java application running on a computer with an attached display via VNC.

I am very familiar with .NET in general but have never had a project that required such a significant focus on international accessibility. \n\nThe projected is initially being done in English. What measures should I take at this point to make it easier to implement localization in the future? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are developing ASP.Net MVC application, are you? Other answers seem to be specific to desktop applications. Let me capture common things:\n\n**Locale detection**\n\nIt is quite important that your application detect user's locale correctly. In desktop application, CultureInfo.CurrentCulture holds preferred formatting locale (the one that should be used to format numbers, dates, currencies, etc.) whereas CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture holds preferred User Interface locale (the one that should be used to display localized messages). For web applications, you should set both cultures to auto (to automatically detect locale from AcceptLanguage header) unless you want to implement some fancy locale detection workflow (i.e. want to support changing language on demand).\n\n**Externalize strings**\n\nAll strings should come from resources, that is Resx files. In Winforms App it is easily achievable by setting form Localizable property to true. You would also need to manually (unfortunately) externalize strings that come from your models. It is also relatively simple. In Asp.Net you would need to externalize everything manually...\n\n**Layouts**\n\nYou definitely need to allow for string expansion. In Winforms world it is achievable via TableLayoutPanel which should be used to make sure that layout will adjust automatically to accommodate longer text. In web world, you are a bit out of luck. You might need to implement CSS Localization Mechanism \\- a way to modify (override) CSS definitions. This would allow Localization folks to modify style issues on demand. Make sure that each HTML element in rendered page has unique id \\- it will allow to target it precisely.\n\n**Culture specific issues**\n\nAvoid using graphics, colors and sounds that might be specific for western culture. If you really need it, please provide means of Localization. Avoid direction\\-sensitive graphics (as this would be a problem when you try to localize to say Arabic or Hebrew). Also, do not assume that whole world is using the same numbers (i.e. not true for Arabic).\n\n**ToString() and Parse()**\n\nBe sure to **always** pass CultureInfo when calling ToString() unless it is not supported. That way you are commenting your intents. For example: if you are using some number internally and for some reason need to convert it to string use: \n\n```\nint i = 42;\nvar s = i.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\n\n```\n\nFor numbers that are going to be displayed to user use:\n\n```\nvar s = i.ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture); // formatting culture used\n\n```\n\nThe same applies to Parse(), TryParse() and even ParseExact() \\- some nasty bugs could be introduced without proper use of CultureInfo. That is because some poor soul in Microsoft, full of good intentions decided that it is a good idea to treat CultureInfo.CurrentCulture as default one (it would be used if you don't pass anything) \\- after all when somebody is using ToString() he/she want to display it to user, right? Turn out it is not always the case \\- for example try to store your application version number in database and then convert it to instance of Version class. Good luck.\n\n**Dates and time zones**\n\nBe sure to **always** store and instantiate DateTime in UTC (use DateTime.UtcNow instead DateTime.Now). Convert it to local time in local format upon displaying:\n\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.UtcNow;\nvar s = now.ToLocalTime().ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);\n\n```\n\nIf you need to send emails with time reference in body, be sure to include time zone information \\- include both UTC offset and list of cities:\n\n```\nDateTime someDate; // i.e. from database\nvar formattedDate = String.Format(\"{0} {1}\", \n             someDate.ToLocaleTime().ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture),\n             TimeZoneInfo.Local.DisplayName);\n\n```\n\n**Compound messages**\n\nYou already have been warned not to concatenate strings. Instead you would probably use String.Format() as shown above. However, I must state that you should minimize use of compound messages. That is just because target grammar rules are quite commonly different, so translators might need not only to re\\-order the sentence (this would be resolved by using placeholders and String.Format()), but translate the whole sentence in different way based on what will be substituted. Let me give you some examples:\n\n```\n// Multiple plural forms\nEnglish: 4 viruses found.\nPolish: Znaleziono 4 wirusy. **OR** Znaleziono 5 wirus\u00f3w.\n\n// Conjugation\nEnglish: Program encountered incorrect character | Application encountered incorrect character.\nPolish: Program napotka\u0142 nieznan\u0105 liter\u0119 | Aplikacja napotka\u0142a nieznan\u0105 liter\u0119.\n\n```\n\n**Other concatenation issues**\n\nConcatenation is not restricted to strings. Avoid laying out controls together, say:\n\nRemind me again in \\[text box with number] days.\n\nThis should be re\\-designed to something like: Remind me again in this number of days: \\[text box].\n\n**Character encoding and fonts**\n\nAlways save, transfer, whatever text in Unicode (i.e. in UTF\\-8\\). Do not hard\\-code fonts \\- Localization might need to modify them and it will turn off default font fall\\-back mechanism (in case of Winforms).\nRemember to allow \"strange\" characters in most fields (i.e. user name).\n\n**Test**\n\nYou will probably need to implement so called pseudo translation, that is create resources for say German culture and copy your English strings adding prefix and suffix. You may also wrap placeholders to easily detect compound strings. The purpose of pseudo translation is to detect Localizability issues like hard\\-coded strings, layout issues and excessive use of compound messages."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will require international localization in the future, which of the following practices is NOT recommended for preparing the application for easier localization?\n\nA) Using String.Format() for all compound messages to allow for different grammar rules in target languages.\n\nB) Storing all DateTime values in UTC and converting to local time only when displaying.\n\nC) Externalizing all strings into resource files (Resx) for easy translation.\n\nD) Hard-coding fonts to ensure consistent appearance across all locales.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because using String.Format() for compound messages is actually recommended to allow for different word orders in various languages, though it's noted that compound messages should be minimized overall.\n\nB is correct and recommended.

I have had basement flooding issues for years. With heavy rain, water comes out of my floors. I have a sump pump that takes care of it. Despite knowing better, Ive been able to ignore it. It hasn't caused any problems. My washer and dryer are the only things down there. However, this morning I started down the stairs and I heard water running. To my dismay, I found a small geyser about 3 inches coming out of the corner of the basement. \n\nI am a little worried because this last summer my garage patio started to get a small crack in it. However, one morning I went to back out of the garage only to find about a 3 foot wide hole had fell in. It was about 6 foot deep. (Thank God for back\\-up cameras.) I was informed there was an old well there and I had it fixed. Last week another crack appeared in the same spot. I also noticed a crack above a bedroom door at the other end of the house.\n\nThe water coming into the basement is about 50 foot from my patio. Should I be worried that the problem is a sink hole and not a water well? Could this problem be diagnosed and fixed for a reasonable amount of money? I have not found a similar problem on the internet. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you have two completely separate issues that you became aware of at the same time, and which are mostly unrelated.\n\n---\n\nImproperly set system and air pressures in bladder tanks.\n\nA note \\- the higher the system pressure, the less water storage (drawdown) in a bladder tank. So you might get better performance from a 40/60 or 30/50 setting.\n\nYou are also at risk of damaging the bladders by underfilling the air for the pressure you have set on the water side. The bladder becomes much more distended than it's designed to be, and lots of water simply sits in the tank with the effective volume of the tank greatly reduced, since the first water to enter the tank is raising its air pressure from your too low setting to where the pressure switch is set, and shrinking the air bubble to do that.\n\n---\n\nLow pressure on the second floor bathrooms is probably from a blockage.\n\nPressure due to elevation is 2\\.3 feet per PSI, so pressure on the second floor due to elevation is probably not really the issue (might be 8\\-10 PSI less than the basement in a typical house) and of course it worked fine until you drained the system; so it's not \"really\" pressure loss, in the sense of the pressure in the pipes \\- IMPE it is often the case that when you drain and refill a water system \"crud\" (usually harmless, but unappealing, deposits from the water) in the pipes gets knocked loose with all the bubbles passing through and will plug shower heads and aerators \\- that does cause pressure loss OUT of the showers and sinks. Try removing shower heads and aerators, cleaning them, and blowing the pipes clear without having them in place.\n\n---\n\nI would suggest draining the system again, verifying that the air pressure is still 38 (if not you may have a leaky bladder) and resetting the pressure switch to 40/60 (with a typical pressure switch, be sure to turn the pump breaker off before adjusting.) Then remove all showerheads and aerators, repressurize the system, and blow the pipes clear before reinstalling the cleaned showerheads and aerators."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is experiencing issues with their water system, including a small geyser in the basement and low water pressure on the second floor.

The recommended solution involves adjusting the pressure settings (possibly to 40/60 or 30/50), ensuring proper air pressure in the bladder tanks, and cleaning the pipes, showerheads, and aerators.

While it appears that Esbern isn't responding and the door won't open, he is actually working on the locks for about 60 seconds. The bug prevents players from hearing his muttering and lock-fiddling, creating the illusion of inactivity.

I am going to list the ones that come to mind!\n\n1. You have selected a custom system font file that does not adhere to standards. **Solution**: revert to the default system font or find another without bugs.\n2. The font file is corrupt. This is not likely since you say it occurs from time to time. **Solution**: Replace it with an original fetched online. Rebuild font caches.\n3. There is a version conflict in the chain of libraries that are responsible for rendering your fonts. **Solution**: `sudo update; sudo upgrade; sudo reboot;` usually does the trick. Also if you have a lot of PPAs installed, I would disable them together with software installed from them temporarily to see if the problem goes away.\n4. One of the font rendering libraries has a bug. This could manifest itself as some glyphs not being rendered properly like in your screen\\-shot. **Solution**: Reinstall font rendering packages.\n5. The font rendering library's cache is corrupt. Font rendering is an expensive/slow operation and it is customary to use caches of rendered bitmaps that are dynamically managed at run\\-time to speed this up. Should the memory or disk\\-space required for this cache not have sufficient security privileges, run out space, become corrupted due to hardware faults then this would make font rendering look ugly. **Solution**: Rebuild font caches with this: `sudo fc-cache -srv; fc-cache -rv`\n6. Hardware accelerated font rendering will rely on both the GPU and its driver. The GPU driver may have a bug or you are having hardware problems with your GPU that manifest themselves as errors in font rendering. Typically GPUs will start malfunctioning \"a little\" when they are under stress, overheat or in some cases when they don't receive enough power from the PSU. **Solution**: make sure your system is not overheating. Make sure your PSU is scaled to handle your GPU. There are utilities that can help you stress\\-test your GPU to see if this produces your problem.\n7. Memory chips have faults that manifest as memory corruptions. If this is the case you may also experience instability. If a memory chip gets just one bit wrong every 4 days this can manifest itself as really hard to track errors. **Solution**: run memtest86 or similar memory testing tools to verify that your chips are fine.\n8. Individual applications may have bugs that manifest themselves like your screen\\-shot. Especially applications that are text and font intense such as web\\-browsers. I have seen this myself in Firefox. At one time all letters were exchanged for small filled boxes. **Solution**: restart app or system if it happens seldom. Update software version if it happens often.\n9. Firmware bugs is a reality, especially in low end hardware. Also bugs in firmware are often masked over in the WINDOWS drivers. For Linux users this means we get to keep the firmware bugs for free. **Solution**: If you got your computer for cheaps, or it is from a vendor not known for it's focus on stability/Linux support then maybe you should start saving for a new system.\n\nHope at least some of this was of use.

This approach addresses multiple potential causes:\n\n1. It updates all system packages, which can resolve version conflicts in font rendering libraries.\n2. It installs any available upgrades, potentially fixing bugs in font rendering packages.\n3. The reboot ensures all changes take effect and clears any temporary issues.\n\nThis solution can address problems related to outdated software, library conflicts, and some types of cache corruption. If this doesn't resolve the issue, the user can then proceed with more specific troubleshooting steps like those mentioned in the other options.\n\nOption A is more specific to font cache issues and wouldn't address other potential causes. Option B assumes the problem is with a custom font, which may not be the case. Option D is a more advanced step that should be considered only after simpler solutions have been tried."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/13", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/561141", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/39133/"], "docs_id": 561141, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a domain at `example.com`.

I just wonder how you people handle the business logic errors? Im trying to do a nice api for my business model. Some methods have quite a lot of validation and I just wonder how should I report them if something goes wrong? Returning true or false or null sometimes won't say what was the actual cause. Sometimes it works sometimes it is not enough. I read that some people use exceptions. I've thought that I could return error messages and when everything goes fine then it would be null. Somehow error codes just don't add up for me..\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are on the right track. Domain or business validation logic should do more than just report true or false. You want to enable the \"user\" of your business classes (ie the UI, or your logging system) to do something more than just report to the end\\-user that something is wrong.\n\nNow, how you do that is completely up to you.\n\nDecision to make: check everything and then report all errors/warnings/information, or stop at the first one you encounter. I would personally opt for the first one and let the UI decide how to use the info. There is a trade\\-off though: some validations may take longer than others and you may want to check these only if the \"simple\" ones succeed.\n\nI wouldn't in any case use exceptions to do this. Some people use exceptions because most development environments have a nice way of showing any unhandled exceptions to the user. I think that is just a bad/lazy choice. And not just because it is then hard to decide where the error came from (though stack traces can help there), but also because it can(will) leave your app in an unpredictable state and may cause errors further down the line that will be even harder to debug.\n\nTherefore, I tend to reserve exceptions for, well exceptional, circumstances. Things I didn't foresee. Validation doesn't fall into that category in my opinion \\- you did foresee all (current) validation concerns or you wouldn't have validated against them.\n\nAll in all, I code the validation in the domain/business classes to collect an array (or whatever I care to use) of error/warning/hint instances. They may be simple strings, they can be fully fledged classes. Usually I always return an instance to the caller and never an unassigned pointer. \"Valid\" is simplu indicated by a message count of zero."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following approaches is recommended by the top answer for handling business logic errors in an API?\n\nA) Use exceptions for all validation errors to take advantage of development environments' built-in exception handling\nB) Return true, false, or null to indicate the success or failure of operations\nC) Implement a system that collects an array of error/warning/hint instances, with validity indicated by a message count of zero\nD) Use error codes to represent different types of validation failures\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer recommends against using exceptions for routine validation, considering them appropriate only for unforeseen circumstances. It also advises against simple true/false/null returns as they don't provide enough information about the cause of errors. The answer suggests collecting an array of error/warning/hint instances, which can be simple strings or full classes. This approach allows for reporting multiple issues at once and provides detailed information about what went wrong. The answer specifically states that \"Valid\" is indicated by a message count of zero, making option C the correct choice.\n\nOption A is explicitly discouraged in the answer as a \"bad/lazy choice.\" Option B is mentioned as sometimes insufficient. Option D (error codes) is not recommended in the answer, which states \"error codes just don't add up for me.\""}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/19", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/179004", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/51976/"], "docs_id": 179004, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to draw the symbol of my engineering and be able to change the color, anyone can help me with this?\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yxjrR.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Run with `xelatex` and change the colors to whatever you need:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[pstricks,border=12pt,12pt]{standalone}\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\n\\setsansfont{Arial}\n\\usepackage{pstricks-add}\n\\colorlet{Yellow}{yellow}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\sffamily\n\\begin{pspicture}%[showgrid=top]\n  (7,10)\n\\psframe*[linecolor=magenta!60!black!90](7,10)\n\\psset{linecolor=Yellow}\n\\pscircle*(3.5,9){0.5}\n\\rput(5,7.75){\\textcolor{Yellow}{\\psscalebox{7}{\\bfseries e}}}\n\\psset{linewidth=5mm}\n\\psline[arrowlength=0.5,arrowsize=0pt 6,arrowinset=0]{->}(3.5,8.2)(3.5,5)\n\\psline(2,4.75)(5,4.75)\n\\psline(1.75,3.75)(2.75,3.75)(3.5,4.75)\n\\psline(3.5,4.75)(3.5,2.5)\n\\rput(3.5,1.75){\\textcolor{Yellow}{\\psscalebox{3}{\\bfseries Ingenier\u00eda}}}\n\\rput(3.5,0.75){\\textcolor{Yellow}{\\psscalebox{3}{\\bfseries Electr\u00f3nica}}}\n\\end{pspicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDZhO.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX code:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the LaTeX code used to create the engineering symbol is correct?\n\nA) The code uses the TikZ package to draw the symbol\nB) The main color used for the symbol elements is defined as Yellow in the code\nC) The code requires compilation with pdflatex to render correctly\nD) The text \"Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica\" is set in Times New Roman font\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect.

The \"stat.timeSinceDeath\" objective tracks the time since a player's last death, which resets to 0 immediately upon dying. The execute command then runs for all players with a dieTime score of 0, effectively triggering right when they die.
