I would also like to increase the indent of footnotes in minipages only. This is handy after tables, for instance.\n\nIdeally, I would use the `footmisc` package with the `norule` option, but this affects the entire document, and not only the minipage environments. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assume that columns B, C, and D are of the `p` type with *usable* widths given by the length parameters `\\colB`, `\\colC`, and `\\colD`. In your example code, these lengths are equal to `2cm` each. The *total* widths of columns B, C, and D are, however, *not* equal to `2cm`. Instead, each column's total width equals `2cm+2\\tabcolsep`, where `\\tabcolsep` is the parameter that governs the amount of whitespace inserted to the left and right of a column. (In the standard LaTeX document classes, the default value of this parameter is `6pt`.)\n\nThe *combined* width of columns B, C, and D \\-\\- not counting the widths of the vertical bars to the left of B and to the right of D \\-\\- is \n\n```\n\\colB + \\colC + \\colD + 6\\tabcolsep + 2\\arrayrulewidth \n\n```\n\n(I'm assuming, implicitly, that the `array` package is being loaded. If that's not the case, then one should omit the `2\\arrayrulewidth` term.) You can probably guess that `2\\arrayrulewidth` represents the combined widths of the two interior vertical bars \\-\\- those separating B from C and C from D. The default value of this parameter is `0.4pt` in the standard document classes.\n\nThe *usable* width of the three columns is a bit smaller, since we mustn't impose on `\\tabcolsep` at the left\\-hand edge of B and at the right\\-hand edge of D. It is thus given by \n\n```\n\\colB + \\colC + \\colD + 4\\tabcolsep + 2\\arrayrulewidth\n\n```\n\nOne can create a length variable called, say, `\\combinedlength` and set its value to the expression above.

This formula accounts for several important factors:\n\n1. The individual column widths (\\colB, \\colC, \\colD) represent the usable space within each column.\n2. The 4\\tabcolsep term accounts for the internal spacing between columns (2 spaces) and at the edges of the combined area (2 spaces). We use 4 instead of 6 because we don't include the outer edges of the entire table.\n3. The 2\\arrayrulewidth term accounts for the width of the two vertical lines separating the three columns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes too much tabcolsep space and doesn't account for the arrayrulewidth. Option C overestimates both tabcolsep and arrayrulewidth. Option D underestimates both parameters.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of LaTeX table structure, spacing parameters, and how they interact in complex table layouts.

But you have tripped yourself up by not following your sign convention rigorously.

At equilibrium, the upward spring force balances the downward gravitational force:\n\nkd = mg\n\nwhere k is the spring constant, d is the displacement, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTo double the stretching distance (d) while maintaining equilibrium, we need to maintain the equality in the equation above. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA) If we double the mass (2m) and keep k the same, we get:\n   k(2d) = (2m)g\n   This satisfies the equilibrium condition with twice the displacement.\n\nB) If we halve k (k/2) and keep m the same, we get:\n   (k/2)d = mg\n   This doesn't double the displacement.\n\nC) If we double both k and m, we get:\n   (2k)d = (2m)g\n   This maintains the original equilibrium without changing d.\n\nD) If we double k and keep m the same, we get:\n   (2k)d = mg\n   This would actually decrease the displacement.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct.

The correct answer, B, is the most appropriate solution because:\n\n1. The primary issue is that the unshare command is failing in the Jenkins chroot environment, likely due to restrictions on changing filesystem propagation.\n\n2. The most critical requirement is that \"mount points are removed on exit every time without fail.\" A custom cleanup function using trap ensures this, even if the script terminates unexpectedly.\n\n3.

Option C (nsenter) wouldn't work because the problem is creating a new namespace, not joining an existing one.\n\n5. Option D (overlayfs) is a creative solution but doesn't address the cleanup requirement and may introduce additional complexity.\n\nThe trap approach allows for explicit unmounting of any mounted filesystems before the script exits, regardless of how it exits.

This solution is based on the experience shared in the documentation and incorporates several key considerations:\n\n1. Auto-save functionality: This addresses the client's primary concern about users forgetting to save their data.\n2. Undo feature: The documentation highlights that about 30% of users changed their minds after editing data, making an undo feature crucial.\n3. Visual feedback: A small notification when data is saved on the server helps users understand the system's state.\n4.

Also, large number of pins will mean that even when the solder melts you have to pull the (now very hot) part off the board, which is not easy.\n\nOne solution is to use a coping saw or similar to slice up the jack, and pliers to crush and break the plastic parts. If you can reduce it to individual pins soldered into holes you should be able to remove them one by one.\n\nThe high power hot air guns you get for stripping paint would also get everything hot enough, but might overheat or blow away nearby components if they are not protected somehow.\n\nI also think it should be possible to use hot air and soldering iron to do this, but it would be tricky. You need a large tip to get the heat flowing, and adding more solder can also help transfer heat. Use the hot air to preheat the jack, and surrounding area of the board \\- ideally from both sides.

You cannot simultaneously have lost and found an item.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it mixes the past perfect (\"had lost\") with the present perfect (\"have found\"), creating a temporal inconsistency.\n\nOption C, while better than A and B, is still problematic. Using \"lost\" in the simple past and \"have found\" in the present perfect doesn't clearly establish the sequence of events and can be confusing.\n\nOption D is correct because it uses the past perfect (\"had lost\") to indicate an action completed before another past action, followed by the simple past (\"found\") to describe the subsequent action of finding the wallet. This maintains both grammatical and logical consistency.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts: understanding of various past tenses (simple past, past perfect, present perfect), the logical relationship between losing and finding, and the appropriate use of tenses to express a sequence of events in the past.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The callback-based system aligns with the asynchronous approach described in the documentation (scenario 2). This method is more suitable for handling unpredictable bursts of data, as it allows sensors to initiate data transmission immediately when new data is available.\n\n2. Asynchronous operations, as explained in the documentation, make a request to I/O with a callback, allowing the I/O handler to signal the original caller when results are ready. This approach minimizes latency compared to synchronous polling.\n\n3. Option A (polling) represents a synchronous approach, which could introduce unnecessary delays and might miss rapid changes in sensor data between polling intervals.\n\n4.

First, the verb \"raise\" in this context means to \"increase the amount, level, or strength of\" or to \"construct or build (a structure)\". Second, a \"tariff wall\" is a metaphorical barrier created by high import duties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the protectionist nature of the policy described. Option B is a literal misinterpretation of the figurative language. Option D misuses the concept of \"raising\" as ending something, which the documentation explicitly states is a less common and potentially confusing usage.\n\nThe correct answer, C, accurately captures the intended meaning of the phrase. By increasing import duties (tariffs), the country makes foreign products more expensive in the domestic market, effectively creating a barrier (wall) to protect home industries from foreign competition. This interpretation aligns with the documentation's explanation of \"raise\" meaning to increase or construct, and the use of \"from\" in the context of protection.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (figurative language, economic policy, and verb usage), applies them to a real-world scenario (analysis of economic policies), and tests critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/16", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/221086", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/39521/"], "docs_id": 221086, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Operate in ZFC. Can we find a function\\-class $\\\\phi$ whose domain is the class of ordinals such that the following properties hold?\n\n* If $x \\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$, then either $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ or there exists some ordinal $\\\\beta \\< \\\\alpha$ with $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) \\= x$;\n* If $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$, then $\\\\alpha \\= \\\\beta$.\n\nThe first of these conditions equivalently states that the image of $\\\\phi$ is a transitive set, except that the natural numbers are treated as urelements, and with the constraint that $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) \\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\implies \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\alpha$.\n\nThe second condition means that $\\\\phi$ is injective and its image is an antichain under inclusion.\n\n---\n\nWe can construct such a function\\-class if we assume additional axioms, such as the existence of no inaccessible cardinals. In particular, the following construction will work:\n\n* $\\\\phi(0\\) :\\= \\\\{ 1 \\\\}$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha \\+ 1\\) :\\= \\\\{ 2, \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\}$ for every $\\\\alpha$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\omega) :\\= \\\\{ 3 \\\\}$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) :\\= \\\\{ 4, \\\\phi(\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta))\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{ \\\\phi(\\\\gamma) : \\\\gamma \\\\in C\\_{\\\\beta} \\\\}$ (where $C\\_{\\\\beta}$ is a cofinal subset of $\\\\beta$ with order\\-type $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta)$ such that no element of $C\\_{\\\\beta}$ is less than or equal to $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta)$), for singular limit ordinals $\\\\beta$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\omega\\_{\\\\alpha\\+1}) :\\= \\\\{ 5, \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\}$ for every $\\\\alpha$\n\nThe first of these rules deals with the zero ordinal, and the second deals with successor ordinals. The third of these handles the special case $\\\\omega$. The fourth handles limit ordinals which are not regular ordinals. The fifth handles initial ordinals of successor cardinals. This construction, however, does not define an image if there are inaccessible cardinals (whose initial ordinals do not fit the form for either the fourth or fifth rules).\n\n**Proof:** We can verify transitivity since every element of $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$ is, by definition, either a natural number or a $\\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ for some earlier $\\\\beta$. Verifying the antichain property is more complicated, but it boils down to the following:\n\n* Clearly $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ means that their unique urelements must agree, which means $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ were processed by the same rule (out of the five provided).\n* The first and third rules each only process one ordinal, and the second and fifth are clearly injective as well.\n* For the fourth rule, we can recover $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\alpha)$ and $C\\_{\\\\alpha}$ from $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$ by removing the urelement, inverting $\\\\phi$, and separating the preimage into its first element and the remaining elements. If $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$, it thus follows that $C\\_{\\\\alpha} \\\\subseteq C\\_{\\\\beta}$, and that they have the same order\\-type (which is a regular ordinal), which implies they have the same limit, so $\\\\alpha \\= \\\\beta$.\n\n---\n\nThis works when there are no inaccessible cardinals, and one can introduce further rules to provide a construction which works under the weaker hypothesis that there are no hyper\\-inaccessible cardinals. Is there a construction which does not depend on additional axioms beyond ZFC?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Adam has shown that Vop\u011bnka's principle implies that there is no\nsuch $\\\\phi$ as in the question. Let me prove this conclusion under\na weaker hypothesis, a large cardinal assumption weaker than VP.\nSpecifically, I claim that if there is a stationary proper class\nof Woodin cardinals, then there is no such $\\\\phi$ as in the\nquestion.\n\nThe assumption that there is a stationary proper class of Woodin\ncardinals is strictly weaker in consistency strength than a supercompact cardinal, which\nis strictly less than an extendible cardinal, which is strictly\nless than Vop\u011bnka's principle (assuming consistency).\n\nLet's begin. Suppose that the Woodin cardinals form a stationary\nproper class, and suppose that $\\\\phi:\\\\text{Ord}\\\\to V$ is a\nfunction with the stated properties. Since there is a closed\nunbounded set of $\\\\delta$ with $\\\\phi''\\\\delta\\\\subset V\\_\\\\delta$,\nthere must be such a $\\\\delta$ that is a Woodin cardinal. Consider\n$\\\\phi\\\\upharpoonright\\\\delta:\\\\delta\\\\to V\\_\\\\delta$. Since $\\\\delta$ is\nWoodin, there is $\\\\kappa\\<\\\\delta$ such that there is an elementary\nembedding $j:V\\\\to M$ with critical point $\\\\kappa$ and for which\n$j(\\\\phi)$ and $\\\\phi$ agree up to and including $\\\\kappa$. In\nparticular, $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)$.\n\nConsider now the elements of $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$. If we have a natural\nnumber $n\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, then by elementarity, we have\n$n\\=j(n)\\\\in j(\\\\phi(\\\\kappa))\\=j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. And if there is\n$x\\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$ that is not a natural number, then\n$x\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ for some $\\\\beta\\<\\\\kappa$. By our assumption on $j$,\nwe know $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\=x$. Since\n$\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, it follows by elementarity that\n$j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\beta))\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$, which\nmeans $x\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. Thus, we've shown\n$\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. But since\n$j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, this means $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset\nj(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. So $j(\\\\phi)$ sometimes has inclusion\ncomparable elements, and by elementarity there must be\n$\\\\alpha\\<\\\\kappa$ with $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)\\\\subset\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$,\ncontradicting one of the properties of $\\\\phi$. **QED**"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A set theorist is attempting to construct a function-class \u03c6 with domain as the class of ordinals, satisfying certain properties.

However, it then proceeds to discuss stronger results.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly questions whether such a construction is possible in ZFC without additional axioms, indicating that it might not be always possible.\n\nOption B is not the strongest statement we can make based on the given information. While the existence of inaccessible cardinals does pose a problem for the specific construction method outlined, it doesn't prove the impossibility of all such constructions.\n\nOption C mentions Vop\u011bnka's principle, which is indeed discussed in the documentation as implying the impossibility of such a \u03c6. However, this is not the weakest assumption under which the impossibility is proven.\n\nOption D is correct and represents the strongest result presented in the documentation. The answer shows that if there is a stationary proper class of Woodin cardinals (a weaker assumption than Vop\u011bnka's principle), then no such function-class \u03c6 can exist.

In Swift iOS programming I could create a pList (flat\\-file) or store settings in the NSUserDefaults. I'm just wondering what my options are in ASP.NET MVC. \n\nI originally wanted to ask \"What's the best way to implement admin/owner settings?\" but I didn't want my question closed as being subjective. I am, however, hoping to deduce what the preferred method is ultimately to adhere to best practices.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My experience is that the \"settings\" supported by C\\# out of the box are not very useful.\n\nStoring the settings in the database is a much better idea for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It will be possible to take a complete backup of the blog by backing up the database without having to remember what other files you need.\n2. If you one day decide to take this system of yours, which currently implements a single blog for a single user, and turn it into a blogging platform supporting many blogs operated by multiple users, you will just create multiple settings records, one for each user, and at least that part will be taken care of. With a settings file, such a thing would be impossible, you would certainly have to rewrite your settings mechanism to make use of the database at that point.\n3. Your settings may need to refer to rows in the database, in which case it only makes sense to also store the settings in the database in order to enjoy the benefits of referential integrity checking. For example, you may wish to add a setting for a \"sticky post\" which is to always be displayed first, regardless of how old it is. If you go with a settings file, then the \"sticky post id\" setting will be just a meaningless number, interpreted by your code to (hopefully) correspond to a blog post. If you store your settings in the database, then the RDBMS will ensure that this number will in fact be the actual id of an existing row in the blog posts table. (Or NULL, if you don't want a sticky post.)\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nThe way this is usually accomplished is by having a settings table with a single row in it. This is not just a wild idea that you had, it is a legitimate technique which has actual application in the real world.\n\nThere is no way to guarantee that additional rows will never be accidentally added to the settings table, but at least you can count the rows during startup and display an error message if more than one row is found.\n\nYou can easily guarantee that there will always be only one instance of the settings object by adding a `private static bool` member to it, and `Assert`ing from the constructor of the object that this `bool` is `false`, then setting it to `true`. This means that the constructor may only be invoked once."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A developer is building a multi-tenant blogging platform and needs to implement a flexible settings system.

The correct answer, C, is the most flexible and scalable approach for the following reasons:\n\n1. Database storage: As mentioned in the top answer, storing settings in the database allows for complete backups without additional files and supports multi-tenancy.\n\n2. Scalability: A key-value pair table can easily accommodate new settings without schema changes, unlike option B which would require adding new columns for each setting.\n\n3.

Option B is the correct answer because:\n\n1. It directly addresses the requirement of a 1% discount with a Rs. 300 maximum using Magento's \"Percent of product price discount\" and \"Maximum Discount Amount\" settings.\n2. It adds a strategic element by excluding high-margin product categories, which protects profit margins on these items while still offering the promotion.\n3. This approach allows for more fine-tuned control over which products the discount applies to, unlike a blanket subtotal discount.\n4. It leverages Magento's category-based rule conditions, which is a more sophisticated use of the system than simple order value conditions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it limits the promotion's effectiveness by restricting it to orders with less than 50 items, which doesn't align with the original requirements and may not be suitable for all businesses.\n\nOption C misinterprets the discount type, as Magento doesn't have a direct \"Fixed amount discount\" calculated as a percentage of the subtotal.

A 2\\.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption.\n\nTaking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of \"intriguing/charming/advanced\" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by [Terry Tao.](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)\n\nThere is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community.\n\nThere are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues.

The key to understanding the issue lies in how the motor windings are connected for different voltages. \n\nFor 460V (high voltage) operation, all windings should be connected in series, forming a single \"Y\" configuration. If the maintenance team mistakenly connected the windings in parallel (as they would for 230V operation), it would result in the motor drawing excessive current and overheating.\n\nOption A is correct because it directly addresses the core issue of incorrect wiring for the voltage used.

He should be fixing this alone and paying for any plumbing issues. This could end up being something that could cost you a few thousand dollars or more if you are in a city. There is a chance that not only do you have grout (cement) blocking one section but it could be layering your whole line on the bottom. Which you think might not be a huge issue if there is a 1/2 inch grout on a 4 inch pipe but this will build up constantly, especially if it isn't PVC.\n\nThere is very little you can do other than replace the pipes. You can try [liquid hammer](http://www.sbsconcreteproducts.com/liquid-hammer.html). My guys use this to clean their wheel barrows and tools from concrete and it really works. However I am not sure it is suitable for pipes. But really what do you have to lose? I would contact the manufacturer of liquid hammer and ask them if you can pour it down a drain legally and what effect it will have on those pipes (my guess is your pipes will last). Then pour if it is legal and see if first if your main clog is gone and then later if there are no issues with your main line. Since it is your house you can monitor if the concrete is causing buildup on main line, and then repeat cleansing or having plumber come out with a bit to break it up."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner discovers a small wet patch on their bathroom ceiling near the wall where the eaves trough runs.

The DPS calculation can indeed be simplified as this :\n\n```\nDPS = Base Damage * Damage Modifier(s)\n\n```\n\nDamage modifiers are skill and stat dependants, but have the same effect, they will apply a boost coefficient to your base damage. As an exemple, 1 point in your primary stat will give you 1% damage increase.\n\nThus, increasing the base damage when changing your weapon(s) will result in a huge increase of your DPS.\n\nFor example, let's assume you're a Demon Hunter and have 500 dexterity, which gives a \\+500% base damage increase.\n\n* With a 100 DPS weapon, you'll get `DPS = 100 * (1 + 500/100) = 600\nDPS`\n* With a 200 DPS weapon, you'll get `DPS = 200 * (1 + 500/100) = 1200\nDPS`\n\nGiven that some armageddon weapon give you 1000\\+ dps and you can reach very high scores in your primary stat (not counting other bonuses as attack speed, damage bonus, ...), you'll see that your DPS can get to really high scores.\n\nSee [this related question](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/60281/how-is-skill-damage-calculated-based-on-weapon-damage) for more information on how DPS is calculated."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about DPS in a game context, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A level 30 Hunter in a fantasy RPG is struggling to increase their DPS (Damage Per Second) significantly.

The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that DPS is primarily driven by the base damage of the weapon, which is then multiplied by damage modifiers. \n\nThe explanation states: \"Thus, increasing the base damage when changing your weapon(s) will result in a huge increase of your DPS.\" It provides an example showing how doubling the weapon's base DPS from 100 to 200 doubles the overall DPS from 600 to 1200, even with the same stat bonuses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that \"DPS won't change based on the difficulty level of the current game.\"\n\nOption B, while not entirely wrong as increasing the primary stat does increase DPS, is less effective than changing the weapon.

Despite the questioner's initial concerns about potential catastrophic cancellation, empirical evidence from the Youngs & Cramer paper showed this method to be superior in practice for minimizing round-off errors.\n\nWelford's method (option A) was found by Youngs & Cramer to not provide significant benefits over naive algorithms, contrary to Welford's claims. The two-pass algorithm (option C) would not be suitable for real-time streaming data as it requires storing all values. The hybrid approach (option D) is a plausible distractor but wasn't mentioned in the documentation and would introduce additional complexity without clear benefits.\n\nThe Youngs & Cramer method balances numerical stability with computational efficiency, making it the most appropriate choice for the given scenario. It allows for single-pass calculation, which is crucial for real-time processing, while empirically demonstrating superior numerical robustness compared to other single-pass methods discussed in the documentation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to critically evaluate different algorithmic approaches for numerical stability in a practical context, requiring integration of information from multiple sources and understanding of the trade-offs involved in numerical computing."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/07", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2270145", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/407775/"], "docs_id": 2270145, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Original question: Provide a sequence ${a\\_n}$ such that $a\\_n \\> 0, \\\\lim\\\\limits\\_{n\u2192\\+\u221e} {a\\_n}^{1/n}$ exists but $\\\\lim\\\\limits\\_{n\u2192\\+\u221e} \\\\frac{a\\_{n\\+1}}{a\\_n}$ does not exist. \n\nI figured that $\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\=\\\\sin(n)$ would be a good candidate.

Since $-1 \\leq \\sin(n) \\leq 1$ for all n, we have $(-1)^{1/n} \\leq {\\sin(n)}^{1/n} \\leq 1^{1/n}$.

Even the, EM energies are the kinetic energy of quantum particles such as photons. Kinetic energy for an well defined particle is an variant only if its velocity changes or simply accelerates (or decelerates). The velocity of an particle can be defined as the change of its space as the time changes or change in its spacetime respect to an observer. So my question is, Is energy only the change in spacetime of an object with respect to an observer?\n\nIt seems to be correct.

Thanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> It is fact that there is only kinetic energy that is eligible to do some work. Even the, EM energies are the kinetic energy of quantum particles such as photons.\n\nThis is simply incorrect, and starting with this incorrect premise may be the reason for your confusion.\n\nGravitational potential energy and electrostatic potential energy are both examples of non\\-kinetic energy that is eligible to do work. In a purely electrostatic field (as opposed to a dynamic electromagnetic field) there are no real photons with the usual KE and momentum relationship typical of photons (i.e. on shell).\n\n> The velocity of an particle can be defined as the change of its space as the time changes or change in its spacetime respect to an observer.\n\nI have never seen any example where any professional physicist refers to the velocity of a particle as the \"change in its spacetime\". I would not recommend using this terminology as it is almost guaranteed to cause confusion.\n\n> So my question is, Is energy only the change in spacetime of an object with respect to an observer?\n\nReplacing the strange terminology \"change in spacetime\" with the standard terminology \"velocity\" this question becomes:\n\n\"Is energy only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer?\"\n\nThe answer is an emphatic \"No\"! Energy is not only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer. Even kinetic energy is $\\\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ which includes mass as well as velocity. So this idea does not work even strictly for kinetic energy. However, as mentioned above, energy is more than just kinetic energy.\n\nThe usual way to define energy is through [Noether's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem). This is probably the single most important theoretical result in all of physics. Noether's theorem shows that continuous symmetries of the action result in a conserved quantity. In the case of energy, [energy is the conserved quantity due to the time\\-translation symmetry of the action](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/%7Ekleinert/b6/psfiles/Chapter-7-conslaw.pdf).\n\nA typical Lagrangian of a point particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V$ would be $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\- V(x)$$ this Lagrangian is time invariant, so applying Noether's theorem gives the conserved energy $$H\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\+ V(x)$$ which is not just the velocity $\\\\dot x$, it also includes the mass $m$ and the potential energy $V$"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about energy and spacetime, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is developing a new theory that attempts to unify the concepts of energy and spacetime.

This is explicitly refuted in the top answer, which points out that non-kinetic forms of energy like gravitational potential energy and electrostatic potential energy can indeed do work.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D also represent issues mentioned in the answer, they are secondary to the main misconception about kinetic energy. Option B relates to a terminological issue rather than a fundamental physics error. Option C is true for kinetic energy calculations but doesn't capture the broader misconception about energy types.

It also directly produces a numeric array rather than a string, which is more suitable for further signal processing tasks.

This approach leverages the topological nature of the Gauss linking number, which is invariant under continuous deformations of the curves. By deforming curve A into a straight line {(1,t,0): t \u2208 \u211d}, we simplify the geometry while preserving the linking number. This deformation makes it easier to visualize how curve B wraps around the simplified version of A.\n\nAfter this deformation, it becomes clear that B wraps around the straight line twice, indicating a linking number of 2. This geometric insight allows us to conclude that the Gauss integral evaluates to 8\u03c0 without performing any complex calculations.\n\nThis method demonstrates a high-level understanding of the problem's topological nature and showcases the power of geometric reasoning in simplifying complex mathematical problems. It's more efficient than direct numerical integration (A), avoids unnecessary complexity of Fourier analysis (C), and is more insightful than relying solely on symbolic computation (D).\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply topological concepts, recognize invariants under deformation, and use geometric intuition to simplify complex mathematical problems \u2013 all key skills in advanced mathematics and theoretical physics."}, "62": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/25", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/10318294", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1328758/"], "docs_id": 10318294, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the standard DOM equivalent for JQuery\n\n`element.append(\"<ul><li><a href='url'></li></ul>\")`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you have to extend the innerHTML property to do this\n\n```\nelement[0].innerHTML += \"<ul><li><a href='url'></a></li></ul>\";\n\n```\n\nsome explanation:\n\n* \\[0] needed because `element` is a collection\n* \\+\\= extend the innerHTML and do not overwrite\n* closing `</a>` needed as some browsers only allow valid html to be set to innerHTML\n\nHint:\nAs @dontdownvoteme mentioned this will of course only target the first node of the collection `element`.

In your case, to buffer your points, it will always use WGS84 in degrees (Since WGS84 is a geographic coordinate system, and not a projected one).\n\nNotice, that changing the CRS by using \"set layer CRS\" does not change their actual values, It only says to QGIS \"from now on, read this values as if they are on this different CRS\". Wish would tell for instance that \"from now on read this degrees as if they are meter\", and that won't work well! :\\-P \n\nTherefore, it's very important that all your layers are set with their correct CRS. If on, QGIS \"On the fly transformation\" will read layers from different CRSs and display them in the Project chosen CRS. (thats why your layers work together)\n\nThe solution is very simple tho, all you need is to reproject you point data to a suitable projected CRS.

The correct approach is to reproject the point data to RGF93 / Lambert-93 using the \"Save As\" function, then create buffers (option C). This solution addresses several key points:\n\n1. It recognizes that the buffer tool uses the input layer's CRS units, which are degrees for WGS84.\n2. It avoids the common misconception of using \"Set Layer CRS,\" which doesn't actually transform the data.\n3. It maintains data integrity by properly reprojecting the data rather than just changing the project CRS.\n4. It allows for accurate buffer creation in meters, which is more intuitive for specifying distances in kilometers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using WGS84 would result in buffers measured in degrees, not kilometers. Option B is a common mistake that doesn't actually transform the data.

For example, if you consider the model of random regular graphs of degree $d$ (graphs chosen uniformly from all $d$ regular graphs on $n$ vertices), and let $X\\_i$ denote the number of cycles of length $i$, then Bollob\u00e1s and Wormald independently showed that the $X\\_i$ behaved asymptotically as independent Poisson variables with mean \n$(d\\-1\\)^i/(2i)$. \n\nIn other words: There's a positive probability that a graph contains each of $3$\\-cycles, $4$\\-cycles, etc. Because these events are asymptotically independent, \"most\" $d\\-$regular graphs have bounded girth. On the other hand, the number of cycles of each fixed length on average remains bounded even as the size of the graph tends to infinity. So if I fix a single vertex and look in the neighborhood of that vertex, I have to look at farther and farther distance before I see any cycles at all. (But not too far...as Louigi noted, we can't expect to go much past the $\\\\log n$ diameter of the graph).

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that sparse graphs are \"locally tree-like,\" meaning that in the neighborhood of a typical vertex, one has to look increasingly far to find cycles as the graph size increases.\n\n2. While the answer doesn't explicitly state O(|V|), which is mentioned in the documentation for the \"typical size of loops,\" it correctly captures the idea that cycle-free neighborhoods extend to a significant portion of the graph's size.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because while sparse graphs have few short cycles, their girth (shortest cycle length) is not necessarily O(log|V|). In fact, the documentation suggests it's larger, on the order of O(|V|).\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because the number of short cycles of fixed length remains bounded even as |V| grows, not growing proportionally.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the locally tree-like property. Most vertices will not be part of short cycles; rather, cycles become more common only at larger distances.\n\n6.

The level of radiation at the surface would be greatly reduced thus making Mars a safer place to live.\n2. Mars would be able to hold a thicker atmosphere than it has now. One of the reasons that Mar's atmosphere is so thin is due to the solar wind actually stripping away the atmospheric gases.\n\nIf such a rod could be built and installed it would be a constant strength and would do a better job of protecting Mars than Earth's field does of protecting the Earth as that fluctuates and is \"due\" for one of it's periodic reversals.\n\nHowever, it's probably beyond our current technologies to build such a rod."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An aerospace engineer is designing a terraforming project for Mars and proposes creating an artificial magnetic field using a large electromagnetic rod.

The documentation states that \"One of the reasons that Mar's atmosphere is so thin is due to the solar wind actually stripping away the atmospheric gases.\" By implementing an artificial magnetic field, Mars would be better protected from solar wind, allowing it to retain atmospheric gases over time.

Option B is the most appropriate solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Precision: A comparator with a carefully chosen reference voltage (12.65 mV, midway between the two states) can reliably detect the small voltage change (0.5 mV) between inactive and active states of the FP system.\n\n2. Simplicity: Compared to the other options, a comparator-based solution is relatively simple and requires fewer components, addressing the requirement to minimize circuit size.\n\n3.

How do I take this switch out of the loop?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can probably replace the switches with those sensors, but you're going to have to do some creative wiring to work around the fact that they're not 3\\-way switches, but the switches you're replacing with them are. You'll likely end up with the light being on whenever either of the switches is on. You also might run into trouble if they ran the 3\\-way switches as a switch loop (no neutral in box), because \"smart switches\" like these require a neutral so they can use power for themselves to decide when to switch on and off.\n\nHere's what the difference between these wiring schemes looks like if you draw it out:\n\n![3-way switches, with neutral and as switch loop](https://i.imgur.com/wcUGG.jpg)\n\nAlso note that those occupancy sensors still have a hard\\-on switch, so your tenants can still just leave the lights on. You might want to look instead at vacancy sensors. (An example vacancy sensor is [Cooper Wiring Devices K01\\-400RW\\-L](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000ZOCSX8), but note that it does not handle CFLs, just incandescents.) These, you tap to turn them on, and they turn themselves *off* automatically when everyone's gone. That sounds more like what you want.\n\nThe how for switch \\#1 depends again on how they wired your \\#1 switches and the light they control together. If you diagram out the connections, it becomes straightforward. Until you have enough info to diagram it out, you don't have enough info to rewire it, either.\n\nAs an aside, all the exterior stairwell lights I've seen in apartment complexes were on timers. They'd come on around dark and flip off in the morning.

The linked occupancy sensors (option A) are problematic because they're not designed for 3-way switch configurations and still allow manual override, which doesn't solve the original problem of lights being left on.\n\n2.

It could still be Bruce Wayne, reprising his role as Batman despite his \"death.\" This could be [Azrael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael_(comics)), who is training to be Batman in several of *Arkham Knight's* challenges. It could also be some other person \\- Robin, Nightwing, etc. \n\nUntil Rocksteady or Warner Bros. decides what's next for the series, we won't know.

Given the ambiguous ending and the information provided, which scenario best explains this development while considering Batman's established principles and the game's narrative themes?\n\nA) Bruce Wayne has fully retired, and Azrael has taken over as the new Batman after completing his training challenges.\nB) Batman faked his death but continues to operate in secret, using advanced technology to disguise his identity.\nC) A new individual (possibly Robin or Nightwing) has assumed the Batman mantle with Bruce Wayne's blessing.\nD) The bat-themed protector is a hallucination, symbolizing Gotham's collective desire for a hero.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the game's ending and Batman's character. Option B is the most likely scenario for several reasons:\n\n1. The answer mentions that Batman is \"staunchly anti-murder,\" making it highly improbable that he actually killed himself and Alfred. This aligns with Batman's core principles.\n\n2. The documentation states that Batman has faked his death before in the Arkham series, establishing a precedent for this behavior.\n\n3.

This option explains the continued presence of a bat-themed protector without introducing new characters or violating established lore.\n\n5. It draws a parallel to Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Rises\" ending, which the documentation explicitly mentions.\n\nOption A is plausible but less likely, as Azrael's training is mentioned as a side challenge rather than a main plot point.

I am currently attending lectures, where we're taught Objective Analysis and Design. It consists mostly of writing use cases, analysing the problem that we can face when writing some application for the client, and how to design the project so that it's both extensible, clear to developers, and doesn't spawn problems when client argues about some features. Since it's 'objective', we're learning it from OOP point of view(classes and such).\n\nNow we're using UML as a helper tool. I believe I have a good grasp on OOP, but I have also learned functional paradigm and used it successfully in some of my smaller projects.\n\nOur teacher, when confronted with \"what about functional paradigm?\" question, answered that he wasn't programming any larger project in functional languages, and he doesn't know what tool may functional programs be using.\n\nSo, what would they use?

This aligns with Ansible's core principle of idempotency, which ensures that running the same task multiple times produces the same result without errors.\n\nThe documentation demonstrates that both ad-hoc commands and playbooks using the user module are inherently idempotent.

This behavior is exemplified in the command output and playbook execution shown in the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it adds unnecessary complexity. Ansible's user module already handles existence checks internally.\n\nOption B is incorrect because try-catch blocks are not a standard feature in Ansible playbooks and would introduce non-idiomatic code.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Using 'ignore_errors' would suppress all errors, including those that should be addressed, and goes against the principle of proper error handling in automation scripts.\n\nBy leveraging Ansible's built-in idempotency, the engineer ensures a robust, clean, and maintainable solution that works consistently across multiple systems and repeated executions."}, "83": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/21", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/225313", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/101916/"], "docs_id": 225313, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Dark matter causes a bend in spacetime.

I am confused about what information the \"magnitude\" values of the transfer function are supposed to contain. I am mainly confused about why the magnitude can be negative. Is this a convention to aid in calculations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The magnitude is just the length of the *space diagonal* of an n\\-dimensional right rectangular prism. In two dimensions this is often just called the *diagonal* of a right rectangle or else the *hypotenuse*. And it is always a positive real number, as you say. (Never really zero, though it can approach it arbitrarily closely.)\n\nHowever, such numbers can also be expressed as logarithms, instead. An advantage gained by expressing positive numbers as logarithms is that multiplication of two positive real numbers can be performed by the addition of their equivalent logarithms, instead. (This fact was used on slide\\-rules, whose use has since fallen by the way because of the advent of computing machines.) Another advantage is that one can more quickly get an idea of the order of magnitude of \\\\$C\\\\$ and the dominance of \\\\$A\\\\$ vs \\\\$B\\\\$ by just a simple glance.\n\nSuppose you want to multiply two numbers, \\\\$A\\\\$ and \\\\$B\\\\$, so that you have to find \\\\$C\\\\$ where \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\\\$. You could instead use \\\\$a\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\$ and \\\\$b\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)\\\\$, sum the two to get \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$, and then find that \\\\$C\\=10^c\\\\$.\n\nIn short, you can say that \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\\\cdot 10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\:\\+\\\\:\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)}}\\\\$.\n\nBut this is really just the same thing as saying \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$.\n\nWhen you are doing a lot of multiplication (and division), using logarithms helps a lot.\n\nThe only issue is that now positive numbers that are less than 1 \\-\\- but still positive \\-\\- will be represented by negative values when turned into logarithms. That's just a quality of logarithms.\n\n2 is larger than 1 so its logarithm will be positive. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(2\\\\right)\\\\approx \\+0\\.30103\\\\$. But 0\\.5 is smaller than 1 so its logarithm will be negative. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(0\\.5\\\\right)\\\\approx \\-0\\.30103\\\\$. Note that if I wanted to multiply \\\\$2\\\\times\\\\frac12\\=1\\\\$ this is the same thing as addition of their logarithms, \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\-0\\.30103\\=0\\\\$, noting though that to get the final answer you perform \\\\$10^0\\=1\\\\$ (so 1 is the answer.)\n\nWith logarithms, a negative number is similar to division. So if you already know that \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\\\$ is the logarithm of 2 then if you notice the addition of a logarithm of \\\\$\\-0\\.30103\\\\$, then you know this means the same thing as division by 2\\. (Even though you are adding it.)\n\n*Amplification* multiplies and *attenuation* divides. Or you could say that *amplification* occurs when multiplying by a value larger than 1 (logarithm is positive) and that *attenuation* occurs when multiplying by a value less than 1 (logarithm is negative.) And you immediately know which is happening by just looking at the sign. So it's often convenient to use logarithms in electronics.\n\nThe only trick in electronics is that there are two common contexts \\-\\- power and voltage. For power, you multiply the logarithm by 10 and for voltage you multiply the logarithm by 20\\. So in the context of power you'd say an amplifier that doubles the power is the same thing as \\\\$\\+3\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. Or doubling the voltage is the same thing as \\\\$\\+6\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. (A few minor decimal points were tossed out.) It's a lot easier to talk about amplification and attenuation that way.

The correct answer is C because negative values on a magnitude plot typically indicate that a logarithmic scale is being used.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. Magnitude is always a positive real number, representing the \"length of the space diagonal\" or amplification/attenuation factor.\n2.

Given this scenario, what is the most effective strategy for the administrator to ensure successful activation of the system?\n\nA) Instruct the colleague to reboot the system every 24 hours until the activation prompt reappears\nB) Guide the colleague through manually launching the activation process using command-line tools\nC) Wait approximately 72 hours, then schedule a call to guide the colleague through the activation process\nD) Advise the colleague to use the system normally for 30 days, then address the activation when it becomes inaccessible\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the given scenario and application of the information provided. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that Windows typically prompts for activation every 72 hours post-initial login.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that enemies replenish indefinitely, making strategy A ineffective and time-consuming.\n2. The top answer suggests that while clearing some enemies can be beneficial, focusing solely on combat is a \"waste of time,\" especially against stronger enemies.\n3.

This solution addresses several key points:\n\n1. It targets the \"page.wrapper\" container, which typically encompasses the entire page content, allowing for full-width placement.\n2.

The expectation value of momentum for this wavefunction is zero. Which of the following statements provides the most comprehensive explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA) The wavefunction's symmetry around x=0 implies equal probability of finding the particle on either side, canceling out any net momentum.\n\nB) The expectation value of momentum is always zero for any odd wavefunction, regardless of its specific form.\n\nC) The integral of \u03c8*(x)\u03c8'(x) over all space is zero due to the odd parity of the wavefunction, resulting in a zero expectation value for momentum.\n\nD) The exponential term in the wavefunction causes rapid decay, confining the particle and preventing any net momentum.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and integration of multiple concepts from quantum mechanics. The correct answer, C, provides the most comprehensive and accurate explanation.\n\nOption A touches on the symmetry aspect but doesn't fully explain the mathematical reason for zero momentum expectation.\n\nOption B is a misconception. While it's true for this specific wavefunction, it's not universally true for all odd wavefunctions.\n\nOption C is correct because it addresses the mathematical foundation of the expectation value of momentum. For a wavefunction \u03c8(x), the expectation value of momentum is given by \u27e8p\u27e9 = -i\u210f\u222b\u03c8*(x)\u03c8'(x)dx. When \u03c8(x) is real and odd, \u03c8*(x)\u03c8'(x) becomes an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval (like -\u221e to +\u221e) is always zero, explaining why the momentum expectation is zero.\n\nOption D introduces a plausible-sounding but incorrect explanation, as confinement alone doesn't necessarily imply zero momentum expectation.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of wavefunction properties, expectation values, and the relationship between a function's parity and its integral, requiring critical thinking beyond mere memorization."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/20", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/748077", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/520840/"], "docs_id": 748077, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just installed Ubuntu 15\\.10 on my HP ZBook Studio G3\\.\nWhen booting, there is a loud static noise from my speakers somewhere where the bios logo shows, which then gets muted.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The issue occurs during the boot process, specifically \"where the BIOS logo shows,\" indicating it happens before the operating system fully loads.\n2. The problem is not Ubuntu-specific, as the top answer mentions the same issue occurs on Windows 10 with the same hardware.\n3. The noise gets muted after the initial static, suggesting that once the operating system takes control, it properly manages the audio.\n4. The brief noise before the login screen could be the handover from BIOS to the operating system's audio drivers.\n5. Normal audio function after login indicates that Ubuntu's audio drivers are working correctly.\n\nThis explanation demonstrates that the issue is likely related to how the BIOS initializes audio hardware during the early boot process, rather than an Ubuntu-specific problem or a hardware incompatibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the audio works fine after login, indicating Ubuntu drivers are compatible.\nOption C is plausible but less likely, as the issue occurs before Ubuntu fully loads.\nOption D is a distractor that might seem plausible but doesn't align with the specific timing of the audio issues described.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a real-world scenario, integrate information from multiple sources (user report and another user's experience), and apply reasoning to determine the most likely cause of a technical issue."}}
