And why is the swap a separate device within the second partition?\n\nI'd prefer to do everything via the command line, but it looks like the more common and easier way is to use `gparted`.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY3FT.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY3FT.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `/dev/sda2` is a logical partition. It works a bit like a container for other partitions. That is why `/dev/sda5` is \"within\" `/dev/sda2`. \n\nIn order to expand `/dev/sda1`, you need to have contiguous unallocated space to expand into. This isn't possible with your current configuration. What you need to do is move the swap partition to occupy the last 8GB of the disk, and then expand `/dev/sda1` to fill the unallocated space in the middle. If you right click the swap partition, there should be an option called `swapoff`. This will unmount the swap space. You must unmount the swap space before you can make any changes to it. Then you should be able to move the swap partition to fill the unallocated space at the end of the drive, leaving unallocated space in the middle. You can remount the swap space by right clicking on it and selecting `swapon`. Then you can expand `/dev/sda1` to fill the unallocated space."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to expand your main partition (/dev/sda1) on a Linux system while keeping the swap partition (/dev/sda2/dev/sda5) the same size.

This method allows for expansion of the main partition while preserving the swap partition's size and functionality. Options A and D are incorrect because they don't account for the need to move the swap partition.

Hence, the failure in name resolution leading to a failure to connect. This is an artefact seemingly of the line wrapping in the console window. If you use the correct host name, it works fine at least for me.\n\n**That said,** there is another thing to keep in mind. These days, some (many) ISPs block direct connections to port 25 on hosts other than their own outgoing mail servers, to help combat spam.

In the telnet command, they used \"alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google\" instead of the full hostname \"alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com\" as shown in the MX records. This small omission would cause a name resolution failure, preventing the connection. While option A is a possibility in general, it's not the most immediate cause based on the information provided.

Disabling GRASS support in QGIS configuration will allow the build to complete successfully.\n\nC) The QGIS source code is outdated and incompatible with GDAL 2.0.

The top answer in the documentation explicitly states that using GRASS binaries linked against a different GDAL version than QGIS is \"certainly a very bad idea\" and suggests building GRASS from source as well.

My first thought was: perhaps all small categories do not have products. Do they? If not, why doesn't the cartesian product just do the trick?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a few problems here:\n\n1. Not every category is sets with additional structure. Many familiar examples are: Groups, topological spaces, and just about every other \"elementary\" examples of categories that you came across when you first learned what a category was. These categories are all examples of [concrete categories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_category), which are categories equipped with a faithful functor to sets. Even though concrete categories are more general than \"sets with structure\", not every category is concrete. For example, the category of topological spaces where morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous maps cannot be made into a concrete category. Also, there is no faithful functor from $Set^{op}$ to $Set$ which is the identity on objects, and so if there is a way to turn $Set^{op}$ into a concrete category (which I do not believe there is), it is at least non\\-obvious.\n2. Even if a category was just sets with additional structure, the pullback of two sets might not have the structure required. If you have a concrete category and the forgetful functor is right adjoint to some \"free\" functor, then because right adjoints preserve limits, you will in fact have that the underlying set of the pullback is the pullback of the underlying sets. However, colimits won't work out so well.\n3. Even if you are in a category of structured sets, and even if the set theoretic pullback is still in your category, you might not have that universal property that you want to have, which would take away some of the usefulness. Of course, this doesn't happen when the forgetful functor is part of an adjunction as above, and I am hard pressed to think of any examples (because it is much more likely that things break in spectacular ways than in subtle ways).\n4. Not every category even has products. For example, in the category of fields, all morphismsare field extensions, and so to have projection map, the product of two fields would have to be a common subfield. However, unless you consider the field with one element to be a field, there are no common subfields of two fields of different characteristic. From a different perspective, the ring that you get by taking the Cartesian product of two fields is NOT a field."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In category theory, why can't the pullback always be defined simply as in the category of sets?\n\nA) Because not all categories have products\nB) Because all categories are concrete categories\nC) Because the set-theoretic pullback always preserves the required structure in any category\nD) Because the universal property of pullbacks is always satisfied by set-theoretic constructions\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is A. Not all categories have products, which is a key reason why pullbacks can't always be defined as in the category of sets. This is explicitly mentioned in point 4 of the documentation, which gives the example of the category of fields.\n\nOption B is incorrect because not all categories are concrete categories. The documentation mentions examples of non-concrete categories, such as the category of topological spaces with homotopy classes of continuous maps as morphisms.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as stated in point 2, even in categories of structured sets, the set-theoretic pullback might not preserve the required structure.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, according to point 3, even when the set-theoretic pullback exists in a category, it might not satisfy the universal property required for pullbacks in that category.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complexities involved in defining pullbacks across different categories and the limitations of applying set-theoretic concepts universally in category theory."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/12", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/975064", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/414351/"], "docs_id": 975064, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On a Linux server I have a directory full of files with digits for names.

Which of the following best describes the likely cause and appropriate solution for this issue?\n\nA) The new fill valve is faulty and needs to be replaced again.\nB) The toilet bowl is cracked, causing water to leak and shoot upwards.\nC) The toilet is partially clogged, and a toilet auger should be used to clear the blockage.\nD) The water pressure is too high, and a pressure-reducing valve should be installed on the main water line.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue described is likely caused by a partial clog in the toilet, not by water actually shooting upwards. The water appears to be erupting because it's not draining fast enough compared to the inflow. This is consistent with a partial blockage in the drain. \n\nWhile the plumber suggested using a snake, a toilet auger is more appropriate for toilets as it's designed to navigate the toilet's bend without damaging the porcelain finish. Option C correctly identifies both the likely cause (partial clog) and the appropriate tool (toilet auger) to address the problem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a faulty fill valve typically wouldn't cause water to erupt during flushing.

I may need to pass an a table and want to make sure that the content of the table does not change.\n\nHowever, in most Objective\\-C program samples, I never see `const`. My question is why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Due to the way that Objective\\-C objects work, `const` gives up being an enforcement and starts being a notation for the programmer. Consider this program:\n\n```\nint f(const int x) {\n    return ++x;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    @autoreleasepool {\n        int x = 3;\n        NSLog(@\"%d\", f(x));\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nThat actually won't compile here (I'm using clang): the compiler can detect the attempt to modify the primitive C type and emits an error. But now compare it with this program:\n\n```\nNSMutableString *f2(const NSMutableString * const x) {\n    [x appendString: @\" world!\"];\n    return x;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    @autoreleasepool {\n        NSMutableString *x = [@\"Hello\" mutableCopy];\n        NSLog(@\"%@\", f2(x));\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nEven though the function is passed a constant pointer to a constant object, it's still possible to mutate the object.\n\nIn object\\-oriented programming, the best way to enforce the constant nature of an object is to make that object immutable \\- i.e. don't provide any methods that can change its state. Imagine that the function above took an `NSString` argument instead of `NSMutableString`, and that I'd passed the literal `@\"Hello\"` instead of a mutable copy. There is now, reasonably speaking, no chance of mutating the passed\\-in object\\[\\*]. Objective\\-C doesn't have any way of enforcing that though, unlike `const` or `final` object references in other OO languages.\n\nFor comparison, `const` works entirely differently in C\\+\\+. If I get a `const` reference to a C\\+\\+ object, I'm only allowed to call `const` member functions on that object. These functions preserve the `const`\\-ness of the object, either by not making any changes or by only modifying member variables that have explicitly been marked `mutable` by the class designer. So imagine that I had some type `MutableString` in C\\+\\+ that's equivalent to `NSMutableString` in Objective\\-C. The equivalent of my example above would look something like:\n\n```\nMutableString& f3(const MutableString& x) {\n  x.appendString(\" world!\");\n  return x;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis definitely won't compile: in addition to `appendString()` not being a `const` operation, the function removes the `const` qualifier from the type reference which requires a `const_cast`.\n\n\\[\\*]I expect there is some contorted way of doing it, but now we're into the realms of one programmer trying to sabotage another by doing \"clever\" things."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Objective-C, why is the use of 'const' qualifier less common and potentially less effective compared to other languages like C++?\n\nA) Objective-C doesn't support const qualifiers at all\nB) const in Objective-C provides complete immutability for objects\nC) Objective-C's runtime nature allows mutation of const-qualified objects in some cases\nD) const in Objective-C only works with primitive types, not objects\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Objective-C, the 'const' qualifier doesn't provide the same level of protection against mutation as it does in languages like C++. Due to Objective-C's dynamic runtime nature, it's still possible to mutate objects even when they're declared as const. \n\nFor instance, a const-qualified NSMutableString can still be modified using its mutable methods. This is different from C++, where const objects can only call const member functions, providing stronger compile-time guarantees of immutability.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Objective-C does support const qualifiers, but their effectiveness is limited.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because, as explained, const doesn't guarantee complete immutability in Objective-C.\n\nAnswer D is partially true for primitive types, but it's not the main reason for const's limited use in Objective-C. The qualifier can be applied to objects, but it doesn't prevent all mutations.\n\nIn Objective-C, true immutability is typically achieved through class design (like NSString vs NSMutableString) rather than const qualifiers. This explains why const is less commonly seen in Objective-C codebases compared to other languages."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/16", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/82467", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/31972/"], "docs_id": 82467, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a corpus of many short entries.

Which of the following best describes the underlying problem and a potential solution?\n\nA) The SVM algorithm is fundamentally flawed for short text classification tasks. The solution is to always use alternative algorithms like Naive Bayes or Random Forests for such datasets.\n\nB) The issue stems from the high dimensionality of the feature space relative to the amount of data. The most appropriate solution is to collect more data to improve classification performance.\n\nC) The problem is caused by an inherent limitation in kernel methods. The solution is to exclusively use linear kernels instead of non-linear ones for short text entries.\n\nD) The challenge arises from insufficient preprocessing of the text data. The solution is to apply more aggressive text normalization techniques like lemmatization and stopword removal.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The StackExchange response identifies that the core issue is not with the SVM algorithm itself, but rather with the nature of the data. Short text entries in a high-dimensional space (which is common in text analysis due to the large vocabulary) lead to sparse feature vectors. This sparsity makes it difficult for the SVM to find meaningful decision boundaries.\n\nThe expert suggests that the problem is fundamentally about the \"dimensionality of the space is vast compared to the number of available data.\" They explicitly state that for text data, the primary solution is to \"find more data.\" This aligns directly with option B, which correctly identifies both the problem (high dimensionality relative to data amount) and the proposed solution (collecting more data).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the issue as a flaw in the SVM algorithm, which is not the case. Option C is incorrect because the problem is not specific to kernel methods, and changing kernel types doesn't address the core issue of data sparsity. Option D is incorrect because while text preprocessing can be helpful, it's not identified as the primary issue or solution in this context."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/01", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41417352", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3343569/"], "docs_id": 41417352, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am attempting to make a login system, that depending on the type of login, will display a different page.

If you choose more than $(n\\-1\\)2^{n\\+2}$ vectors, then $n$ of them must lie in one of those translates, and therefore in an $(n\\-1\\)$\\-dimensional subspace.

My question is the following: Wikipedia gives three assumptions that need to hold for the Wilcoxon signed rank test (slightly modified for my questions):\n\nLet Zi \\= Xi\\-Yi for i\\=1,...,n.\n\n1. The differences Zi are assumed to be independent.\n2. (a.) Each Zi comes from the same continuous population, and (b.) each Zi is symmetric about a common median;\n3. The values which Xi and Yi represent are ordered...so the comparisons 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to' are useful.\n\nThe documentation for ?wilcox.test in R, however, seem to indicate that (2\\.b) is actually something that is tested by the procedure:\n\n\"...if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a Wilcoxon signed rank test of the null that the distribution ... of x \\- y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed.\"\n\nThis sounds to me as though the test is performed for the null hypothesis that \"Z is distributed symetrically around median mu\\=SomeMu\" \\-\\- such that rejection fo the null could be *either* a rejection of the symmetry *or* a rejection that the mu around which Z is symmetric is SomeMu.\n\nIs this a correct understanding of the R documentation for wilcox.test? The reason this is important, of course, is that I am conducting a number of paired\\-difference tests on some before\\-and\\-after data (\"X\" and \"Y\" above). The \"before\" and \"after\" data individually are highly skewed, but the differences are not skewed nearly as much (although still skewed somewhat). By that I mean that the \"before\" or \"after\" data considered alone has skewness \\~7 to 21 (depending on the sample I am looking at), while the \"differences\" data has skewness \\~\\= 0\\.5 to 5\\. Still skewed, but not nearly as much. \n\nIf having skewness in my \"differences\" data will cause the Wilcoxon test to give me false/biased results (as the Wikipedia article seems to indicate), then skewness could be a big concern. If, however, the Wilcoxon tests are actually testing whether the differences distribution is \"symmetric around mu\\=SomeMu\" (as ?wilcox.test seems to indicate) then this is less of a concern.\n\nThus my questions are:\n\n1. Which interpretation above is correct? Is skewness in my \"differences\" distribution going to bias my Wilcoxon test?\n2. If skewness *is* a concern: \"How much skewness is a concern?\"\n3. If the Wilcoxon signed rank tests seem grossly inappropriate here, any suggestions for what I should use?\n\nThanks so much. If you have any further suggestions about how I might do this analysis I am more than happy to hear them (although I can also open another thread for that purpose). Also, this is my first question on Cross Validated; if you have suggestions/comments on how I asked this question, I am open to that as well!\n\n---\n\nA little background: I am analyzing a dataset that contains observations on what I'll call \"errors in firm production.\" I have an observation on errors occuring in the production process before and after a surprise inspection, and one of the goals of the analysis is to answer the question, \"does the inspection make a difference in the oberved number of errors?\"\n\nThe data set looks something like this:\n\n```\nID, errorsBefore, errorsAfter, size_large, size_medium, typeA, typeB, typeC, typeD\n0123,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0 \n2345,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0\n6789,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0\n1234,8,8,0,0,1,0,0,0\n\n```\n\nThere are roughly 4000 observations. The other variables are catagorical observations that descrie characteristics of the firms. Size can be small, medium, or large, and each firm is one and only one of those. Firms can be any or all of the \"types.\"\n\nI was asked to run some simple tests to see if there were statistically significant differences in observed error rates before and after the inspections for all firms and various sub\\-groupings (based on size and type). T\\-tests were out because the data was severely skewed both before and after, for example, in R the before data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore)\n# Min.  1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# 0.000  0.000    4.000  12.00    13.00  470.0\n\n```\n\n(These are made up \\-\\- I'm afraid I can't post the actual data or any actual manipulations of it due to proprietary/privacy issues \\-\\- my apologies!) \n\nThe paired differences were more centralized but still not very well fit by a normal distribution \\-\\- far too peaked. Differences data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore-errorsAfter)\n# Min.   1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# -110.0  -2.000   0.000  0.005   2.000   140.0\n\n```\n\nIt was suggested that I use a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and after a brief persusal of ?wilcox.test and Wikipedia, and here, this seems like the test to use. Considering the assumptions above, I believe (1\\) is fine given the data generating process. Assumption (2\\.a) is not strictly true for my data, but the discussion here: [Alternative to the Wilcoxon test when the distribution isn't continuous?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4834/alternative-to-the-wilcoxon-test-when-the-distribution-isnt-continuous) seemed to indicate that this wasn't too much of a concern. Assumption (3\\) is fine. My only concern (I believe) is Assumption (2\\.b).\n\n**One additional note**, some years later: I eventually took an excellent non\\-parametric stats course and spent a lot of time on the rank\\-sum tests. Embedded in assumption (2\\.a), \"Each Zi comes from the same continuous population\", is the idea that both samples mush come from populations with *equal variance* \\-\\- this turns out to be *extremely* important, practically speaking.

Skewness is not a problem, since the signed\\-rank test, like most nonparametric tests, is \"distribution free.\" The price you pay for these tests is often reduced power, but it looks like you have a large enough sample to overcome that.\n\nA \"what the hell\" alternative to the rank\\-sum test might be to try a simple transformation like $\\\\ln(x\\_i)$ and $\\\\ln(y\\_i)$ on the off chance that these measurements might roughly follow a lognormal distribution\\-\\-so the logged values should look \"bell curvish\". Then you could use a t test and convince yourself (and your boss who only took Business Stats) that the rank\\-sum test is working. If this works, there's a bonus: the t test on means for lognormal data is a comparison of medians for the original, untransformed, measurements.\n\nMe?

Typical theoretical predictions depend on many other measured and calculated (or both) numbers besides pi.\n\nNevertheless, it is true that one needs to substitute the right value of pi to get the right predictions. Therefore, the right answer to your question is the most accurately experimental verified theoretical prediction we have in physics as of today, namely the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron\n\n> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment>\n\nIn some natural units, the magnetic moment of the electron is expressed as a g\\-factor which is somewhat higher than two.

The theoretical prediction agrees with the experimental measurement within the tiny error margin; the theoretical uncertainty contains the effect of new species of virtual particles with the masses and couplings that have not yet been ruled out. This requires, among many and many other things, to substitute the correct value of $\\\\pi$ in Schwinger's leading correction $\\\\alpha/2\\\\pi$. You need to know 9\\-10 decimal points of $\\\\pi$ to make this correction right within the experimental error.\n\nSo in practice, $\\\\pi\\\\approx 3\\.141592654$ would be OK everywhere in the part of physics that is testable.

Because **I** is a *[subject pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_pronoun)*, and should not be used in object position. Let's see how the sentence will look if we omit \"my family\":\n\n> My parents will reside with **I**.\n\nThis is a strange\\-sounding sentence. \n\n---\n\nIn \"standard\" English there's a tradition to frown upon the use of **me** in subject position. Why? Because when we omit the \"**and**\\-part\", we get this:\n\n> **Me** will reside with my parents.\n\nSounds a bit strange. The \"correct\" form of the pronoun for subject position is **I**. \n\n---\n\nP.S. When someone attempts to use **I** instead of **me** in object position in order to be more \"formal\", it is called \"*[hypercorrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection#Personal_pronouns)*\". Quoting Wikipedia, \n\n> Jack Lynch, assistant professor of English at Rutgers University, says that correction of \"*me and you*\" to \"*you and I*\" as subject leads people to \"internalize the rule that '*you and I*' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they shouldn't \u2013 such as '*he gave it to you and I*' when it should be '*he gave it to you and me*.'\"\\[7]\n> \n> \n> On the other hand, the linguists Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum claim that utterances such as \"*They invited Sandy and I*\" are \"heard constantly in the conversation of people whose status as speakers of Standard English is clear\"; and that \"Those who condemn it simply assume that the case of a pronoun in a coordination must be the same as when it stands alone. Actual usage is in conflict with this assumption.\"\\[8]\n\nThat's a nice observation by H\\&P.

This algebra $A^!$ is also quadratic by construction, and is known as the *Koszul dual* of $A$. It's pretty clear that $(A^!)^! \\\\simeq A$.\n\nOne example of this is given by the symmetric and exterior algebras of a vector space and its dual, i.e. for a finite\\-dimensional vector space $V$, we have\n$$ S(V)^! \\\\simeq \\\\Lambda(V^\\*), \\\\quad \\\\Lambda(V)^! \\\\simeq S(V^\\*). $$\n\nClifford and Weyl algebras\n--------------------------\n\nNow suppose that $V$ is even\\-dimensional, say $\\\\mathrm{dim}\\_\\\\mathbb{C}(V) \\= 2n$, and let $h: V \\\\otimes V \\\\to k$ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on $V$. The *Clifford algebra* is the algebra\n$$ \\\\mathrm{Cl}(V,h) \\= T(V)/\\\\langle x \\- h (x) \\\\mid x \\\\in S^2(V) \\\\rangle, $$\nand this can be viewed as a deformation of the exterior algebra in the sense that the Clifford algebra is naturally filtered and the associated graded is $\\\\Lambda(V)$. If $h$ is nondegenerate, then (over $\\\\mathbb{C}$, at least) we can show that $\\\\mathrm{Cl}(V,h) \\\\simeq M\\_{2^n}(\\\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nIf we take instead a nondegenerate alternating (i.e. symplectic) form $g:V \\\\otimes V \\\\to k$, then we can form the *Weyl algebra*\n$$ A\\_n \\= A\\_n(V,g) \\= T(V)/\\\\langle x \\- g(x) \\\\mid x \\\\in \\\\Lambda^2(V) \\\\rangle. $$\nThis too has a natural filtration from the tensor algebra, and the associated graded is $S(V)$.\n\nThese two deformations share some features in common. For instance, the Weyl algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of polynomial differential operators on $\\\\mathbb{C}\\[x\\_1, \\\\dots, x\\_n]$, and one can think of the Clifford algebra as being a $\\\\mathbb{Z}/2$\\-graded analogue of that via creation and annihilation operators on $\\\\Lambda(V)$.

Non-homogeneous Koszul duality, as developed by Positsel'ski\u012d and others, relates quadratic-linear-constant algebras (such as Weyl or Clifford algebras) to curved quadratic DG algebras.

There are $k!$ ways of ordering the numbers, $C\\_{k\\-1} \\= \\\\frac1{k}{2k\\-2 \\\\choose k\\-1}$ ways of choosing places to insert the arithmetic operations (without running out of numbers on the stack) and $4^{k\\-1}$ ways of choosing which of the four operations we will insert at each place, for a grand total of $4^{k\\-1}\\\\frac{(2k\\-2\\)!}{(k\\-1\\)!}$ ways of combining $k$ numbers with the four operations.

Hence $\\\\log N\\_k \\\\le k(\\\\log k \\+ \\\\log 16\\)$. \n\nThe lower bound is a little bit more interesting.

Then we can write any positive integer $n \\< b^r$ as $\\\\sum\\_{i\\=0}^{r\\-1} a\\_i b^i$, with $0 \\\\le a\\_i \\\\le b\\-1$, and then, by collecting the terms with a given \"digit\" $a\\_i$, we can write $n$ as a sum of terms of the form $a(b^{i\\_{a1}} \\+ \\\\ldots \\+ b^{i\\_{aj\\_a}})$, where each $a$, $0 \\\\le a \\\\le b\\-1$, appears at most once. Of course, we can throw out the term with $a\\=0$, and not write the 1 when $a\\=1$, so we can write our number with $2, 3, \\\\ldots, b\\-1, 1, b, \\\\ldots, b^{r\\-1}$. \n\nIf we allow subtraction as well we can use Francois's idea (and the same set of numbers) to show that $N\\_{b\\+r\\-2} \\\\ge ((2b \\- 1\\) ^ r \\- 1\\)/2$ when $b \\\\ge 2, r \\\\ge 1$. \n\nEven with only addition and multiplication, we obtain (roughly) $N\\_k \\\\ge (\\\\epsilon k)^{(1\\-\\\\epsilon) k}$ for $k$ large given $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, and hence $\\\\log N\\_k \\\\ge (1\\-\\\\epsilon) k \\\\log k$ when $k$ is large given $\\\\epsilon$.

Which of the following statements about the likelihood ratio test statistic S is correct?\n\nA) S = -2(\u2113(\u03bc\u2080) - \u2113(\u03bc\u0302)), where \u03bc\u2080 is the mean that maximizes the likelihood without any constraints.\n\nB) S = n(\u03bc\u0302 - \u03bc\u2080)\u1d40\u03a3\u207b\u00b9(\u03bc\u0302 - \u03bc\u2080), where \u03bc\u0302 is the sample mean and \u03bc\u2080 is the solution to a constrained optimization problem.\n\nC) The constrained optimization problem to find \u03bc\u2080 always has a unique solution given by \u03bc\u2080 = R\u207b\u00b9r.\n\nD) The Lagrangian method is not applicable for finding \u03bc\u2080 in this scenario.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because \u03bc\u2080 should be the mean that maximizes the likelihood subject to the constraints imposed by H\u2080, not without constraints.\nB is correct. It accurately describes the simplified form of the likelihood ratio test statistic, where \u03bc\u0302 is the sample mean (unconstrained MLE) and \u03bc\u2080 is indeed found through a constrained optimization.\nC is incorrect because R\u207b\u00b9r is only the solution if R is invertible. In general, finding \u03bc\u2080 requires solving a constrained optimization problem.\nD is incorrect because the Lagrangian method is actually a key approach to solving the constrained optimization problem for \u03bc\u2080."}}
