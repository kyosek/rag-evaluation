In the blogpost, [A Day in the Penalty Box](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/), it doesn't explain what this means. I am not asking ***why*** he was suspended but rather what is the ***definition*** of the reason he was suspended for.\n\nSo as said before, what does it mean to be suspended for promotional content?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short suspension reasons that are publicly displayed are linked to the moderator message template that is selected when suspending. In this case the template is the following:\n\n> We noticed that a substantial proportion of your posts seem to exist\n>  only to promote your product or website. Per the [help\n>  center](https://biology.stackexchange.com/help/behavior):\n> \n> \n> \n> > Be careful, because the community frowns on overt self\\-promotion and tends to vote it down and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant\n> >  answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or\n> >  website, so be it. However, you *must* disclose your affiliation in\n> >  your answers. Also, if a huge percentage of your posts include a\n> >  mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong\n> >  reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad\n> >  sales team for details.\n> \n> \n> Any type of \"astroturfing\" promotion is not acceptable. It brings\n>  down the overall value of genuine recommendations for everyone on the\n>  site.\n> \n> \n> If you can stay within the above guidelines, and offer questions and\n>  answers of genuine benefit to the community which happen to mention\n>  your affiliation or product in context \\-\\- and with full disclosure \\-\\-\n>  then your future contributions are welcome.\n\nThis is pretty much the official definition for this specific suspension reason.

The key points are:\n\n1. Posts should not exist solely to promote a product or website.\n2. Good, relevant answers should be the primary focus.\n3. Affiliation must be disclosed when mentioning your product.\n4. Only some, not all, of your posts should include mentions of your product.\n5. Genuine recommendations and benefits to the community are valued.\n\nOption C aligns with these guidelines by allowing occasional mentions of a product in relevant contexts with proper disclosure.

Both the `BasePrice` and `Price` could be set separately. But the `Price` cannot be, says, greater than `BasePrice + 1000`.\n\nSince both of them can be set separately, if we update the `BasePrice`, the `Price` might be not valid anymore.\n\nHow to solve these dependencies between value objects?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A `Price` object which depends on an **updateable** `BasePrice` cannot be a value object, since value objects should be *immutable* (at least, by the book).\n\nSo if `Price` and `BasePrice` are both immutable, and `Price` holds a reference to a `BasePrice`, if one needs a price with a different base price, it will be necessary to create a new `Price` object with a new `BasePrice` passed in the constructor, so the old `Price` object stays valid. However, if `Price` and `BasePrice` should both be properties of a `Product`, this is probably not a good idea, since now the `Price` object of the product might reference a different base price than the `Product` itself.\n\nHence, when you want `Price` and `BasePrice` to be independent properties of your `Product`, each one should not know anything about the other directly. Therefore, the constraint \"Price must be between BasePrice and BasePrice\\+1000\" makes sense only in the context of a `Product` object. This constraint needs to be checked whenever a method like `Product.SetPrice` or `Product.SetBasePrice` is called.\n\nStill, the business logic for checking against the base price can be part of the `Price` object. Design the latter with a method `IsInValidRange(BasePrice bp)`, and call it like this\n\n```\n   class Product\n   {\n        BasePrice basePrice;\n        Price price;\n\n        void ChangePrice(Price newPrice)\n        {\n             if(!newPrice.IsInValidRange(basePrice))\n                  throw new InvalidPriceException();\n             price = newPrice;\n        }\n\n        void ChangeBasePrice(BasePrice newBasePrice)\n        {\n             if(!price.IsInValidRange(newBasePrice))\n                  throw new InvalidPriceException();\n             basePrice = newBasePrice;\n        }\n   }\n\n```\n\nI guess your issue lies in the the phrase *\"business logic stored in the value objects as constraints\"* \\- better replace \"stored\" by \"implemented\", this yields to the kind of solution I sketched above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a domain-driven design scenario, you're implementing a Product entity with BasePrice and Price value objects.

What this means is it's one large partition that within it can be placed multiple 'logical' partitions \\- in this case, `/dev/sda2` is an extended partition that fills the rest of your disk after the first partition `/dev/sda1`, and within `/dev/sda2` your swap partition exists as `/dev/sda5`.\n\nTo extend your `/dev/sda1` you need to do the following first:\n\n1. Disable your swap partition. `sudo swapoff /dev/sda5`\n2. Using `gparted`, shrink `/dev/sda2` so it contains *only* `/dev/sda5` and no free space.\n3. Using `gparted`, move `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda5` together to the end of the disk.\n4. Resize (grow) your `/dev/sda1` after the previous tasks are completed.\n5. Reenable your swap partition. `sudo swapon /dev/sda5`\n\nAlternatively, you can do the following instead, which gets you more in line with what modern Ubuntu does (which is to use **swapfiles** instead of swap *partitions*):\n\n1. Disable your swap partition. `sudo swapoff /dev/sda5`\n2. **Delete** both partition 5 and Partition 2 via `parted`\n3. Grow your `/dev/sda1` and its filesystem.\n4. Use a swapfile instead of a swap partition, from within your single partition.\n\n```\nsudo fallocate -l 4GiB /swapfile\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n\n```\n5. Once the swapfile is created, add this to `/etc/fstab` on the end of the line so that the swapfile is enabled automatically at boot time:\n\n```\n/swapfile    swap    swap    sw    0    0\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is trying to expand the root partition (/dev/sda1) on a Linux system.

If your repository implements an interface, and your application consumes the repository as an interface rather than concrete implementation, then it is easier to isolate parts of your application that require data access. Your unit tests can mock the repository by injecting a TestMyRepository object, which implements the same interface.\n\nSo it is not really about the application using only one implementation. It allows you to create a second implementation for testing purposes. It is easy to forget that mock or stub objects are also concrete implementations. Mocks and stubs exist to facilitate testing rather than actual data access."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Spring/Springboot applications, what is the primary benefit of having separate interface and implementation classes for a bean in the same package and module?\n\nA) It allows for multiple production implementations of the same interface\nB) It improves application performance by reducing coupling\nC) It facilitates easier unit testing through mocking and stubbing\nD) It enables automatic dependency injection in Spring\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary benefit of separating interfaces and implementations in this context is to facilitate easier unit testing. By defining an interface and coding against it, developers can create mock or stub implementations for testing purposes. This allows parts of the application that depend on data access to be isolated and tested independently of the actual data layer. While options A and D are potential benefits of using interfaces, they are not the main reason in this specific scenario. Option B is incorrect as this separation doesn't inherently improve performance."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/26", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/454704", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/220456/"], "docs_id": 454704, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can someone explain me the terms : DRAM Rank and a DRAM Channel is simple terms.\n\nI went through this [PDF](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs7810/pres/11-7810-12.pdf) and I was not able to understand the DRAM Organisation/architecture on page 3 and page 11\\. Can someone help me understand those block diagrams.\n\nI have seen some server board PCBs. In that, I have seen many DIMM Slots. Like, I have 12 DIMM Sockets. 6 sockets were black in color and 6 were blue in color. Does this difference indicate different channels, if not, why is there a difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably missed the concept of hierarchy.\n\nLook at page 5: \"DIMM, rank, bank, array form a hierarchy in the storage organization\".\n\n1 DIMM can have more than 1 ranks. One rank can have more than 1 banks, and so on. Some are vertical elements, some are horizontal elements.\n\nConsider memory is organized cells, each cell a bit (value 0 or 1\\), and multiple cells in array; so to read the value stored in one of those cells (or to store a value in a cell), you must provide a \"row \\* column\" cell address. Because there are limits to the number of rows and columns, as well as efficiency problems when the array is too big, the hierarchy depth has been increased adding more dimensions. So instead of having just rows and columns... you have rows, columns, banks, and ranks. A full address to find the value in a cell would be: \"row \\* column \\* bank \\* rank\".\n\nLet's make an example: you have a 32 bit DRAM controller. One bit is needed to say if the number is negative or positive; so you have 31 bits left for the numbers, this means that the biggest number it can use in one cycle is 2^31 (2,147,483,647\\). To use bigger numbers it must wait 2 cycles (the access time doubles! And the computer would halve its speed; and this would be unacceptable). A cell address is a number as well, and this means that the highest cell address is 2,147,483,647\\. In other words, if you had a simple row of cells, you would not be able to address more than 2,147,483,647 bits (i.e. : less than 256MB!). So instead of having a simple row of cells, they used an array: \"rows \\* columns\". This means that you can have \"2,147,483,647 \\* 2,147,483,647\" cells (trillions of bits can be addressed). **If you add more depth to the hierarchy, you can get more addresses for cells.**\n\nThis is an over simplified example. The real thing is much different. But I wanted to show you **one of the advantages of increasing the heiarchy depth: increased address space**.\n\n**Another advantage is the speed, because of parallelism.** So, let's say that your cpu can read 2 values in 1 cycle. But your ram chip is organized in rows and columns, and to read one cell it needs to turn on (ie: give electricity) to 1 full row and 1 full column only, so that at the crossing of that row and column, a single cell turns on ... and allows you to access its value. How are you going to concurrently access 2 cells that are on totally different rows and columns, if you can turn on only 1 row and 1 column at once? **One of those hierarchy levels could be used for this purpose, instead of using it to increase the address space. And here we go: channels.** If you place data on different DIMMs, connected to 2 different channels, you can use both DIMMs at the same time, independently from one another. In this way your CPU can access both DIMMs at the same time, and get 2 values in 1 cycle.\n\nTo conclude: memory is organized in a multi dimensional matrix so that it is possible to work around all the limits (bandwidth, address size, electric needs, and so on) without compromising on performance. If you go back to your slides, you'll see that ranks, banks, arrays... are just unique names given to those dimensions.\n\nColors on DIMM slots can be anything. Can be the channel, but can be something totally different, example: some boards can have both DDR3 and DDR4, and because those two families have different voltages... you'd better not place the lower voltage one into a higher voltage slot, or magic smoke will puff your eyes. This doesn't happen nowadays, because every ram generation has a different number of pins and/or notch positions. But some bad DIMM/slot combos can still hurt your wallet... so pay attention anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary advantages of increasing the depth of the memory hierarchy in DRAM architecture?\n\nA) It allows for faster clock speeds and reduces power consumption\nB) It increases address space and enables parallel access, improving performance\nC) It simplifies the manufacturing process and reduces production costs\nD) It improves data retention and reduces the need for refresh cycles\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Increasing the depth of the memory hierarchy in DRAM architecture provides two main advantages:\n\n1. Increased address space: By adding more levels to the hierarchy (such as ranks and banks), the total number of addressable memory cells can be significantly increased without requiring longer address bits.\n\n2. Improved parallelism: Different hierarchy levels (like channels) allow for concurrent access to multiple memory locations, enabling the CPU to read or write multiple values in a single cycle.\n\nOption A is incorrect as clock speeds and power consumption are not directly related to hierarchy depth. Option C is false because increasing hierarchy depth actually makes the architecture more complex. Option D is unrelated to the hierarchy depth and pertains more to the physical properties of DRAM cells."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/28", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/734605", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/311226/"], "docs_id": 734605, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm working on an InfoSec exercise, specifically email spoofing.

Hence, the failure in name resolution leading to a failure to connect. This is an artefact seemingly of the line wrapping in the console window. If you use the correct host name, it works fine at least for me.\n\n**That said,** there is another thing to keep in mind. These days, some (many) ISPs block direct connections to port 25 on hosts other than their own outgoing mail servers, to help combat spam.

The biggest factor now is that cordless drills have fallen so far in price that the market for corded is comprised entirely of people who have opted out of cordless. The superior holding power of keyed chucks, depth stops, secondary handles to counter torque, along with the more powerful tool make the corded drill excel at drilling multiple or difficult holes. \n\nOther features which have remained on the corded drill are because of its superiority in continuous usage. The trigger lock can be handy if you're using the drill as a grinder, buffer, whatever. If you need to use the drill inverted for whatever reason it's easier than holding the trigger with a pinky. Setting the speed via a dial rather than trigger pressure is also preferable there, because you can lock in the slower speed. \n\nThe keyless chuck and clutch common on cordless drills are more user friendly when it comes to rapid bit changes and driving fasteners. The addition of the clutch necessitates reverse, because \"only drives screws\" is an awful selling point. Driving screws with a corded drill is easy, but breaking out the key every time you need to drill a pilot hole and getting out a screw driver if you need to back out a screw gets old really quickly."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the design differences between corded and cordless drills?\n\nA) Corded drills were designed for industrial use, while cordless drills were initially designed for hobbyists, leading to different feature sets that have persisted over time.\n\nB) Cordless drills have more advanced features because they were developed later than corded drills, incorporating technological improvements.\n\nC) The design differences are primarily due to the power source, with battery-powered drills requiring a completely different set of features than plug-in drills.\n\nD) Corded drills retain features optimized for continuous, heavy-duty use, while cordless drills have evolved to prioritize versatility and user-friendly operation for a broader market.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation indicates that corded drills have retained features that are beneficial for continuous, heavy-duty use, such as keyed chucks for superior holding power, depth stops, secondary handles to counter torque, and trigger locks for extended operation. These features cater to users who need sustained power and precision for difficult drilling tasks. \n\nIn contrast, cordless drills have evolved to prioritize versatility and user-friendly operation.

The filenames are long, so I'd like to generate a vector of filenames that can then be accessed by my own custom downstream function for reading them into a dataframe, plotting, etc. \n\nFor example, the files look like:\n\n```\n 5_simulationA.k  5_simulationA.b\n10_simulationA.k 10_simulationA.b\n 5_simulationB.k  5_simulationB.b\n10_simulationB.k 10_simualtionB.b\n\n```\n\nThe \".k\" and \".b\" files are mates of a pair and must stay together for downstream processing. \n\nI could read in these files by writing a nested loop that would look something like, \n\n```\nK_files = c()\nB_files = c()\n\nfor (i in c(A,B,C)){ # iterate over letter variable\n    for (n in c(5,10,15)){ #iterate over numbers of the files\n        k_filename = paste(n, \"_simulation\", i, \".k\")\n        b_filename = paste(n, \"_simulation\", i, \".b\")\n        K_files = c(K_files, k_filename)\n        B_files = c(B_files, b_filename)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is of course very ugly and un\\-R\\-like.

Now, for each $r\\_i$\\-partite set, we are blocked from making $r\\_i\\\\choose 2$ edges.

There are a few hacks:\n\n1. Boot into OSX, turn the brightness to your desired level, unplug the USB cable going into your monitor. Boot back into Windows and the Bootcamp software will now be unable to reduce the brightness over USB. (Downside: The USB ports on your monitor will no longer be useable.)\n2. Stop the Bootcamp software from starting when Windows boots. (Go into MSConfig \\> Startup Items and disable Bootcamp.) Then boot into OSX, turn the brightness to your desired level, and when you return to Windows, the software will no longer run and turn the brightness down to 0\\. (Downside: You won't be able to use the \"special\" keys on your Apple keyboard (e.g. volume control), and you may possibly lose other minor Apple functionality.)\n\nThe bottom line is that Apple seem to have deliberately done this.

You can do so by running the following command.\n\n`firefox -safe-mode`\n\nYou should then get a dialog box with several options make sure that Disabled all add\\-ons is checked and click on Continue in Safe Mode. There are other options there to reset certain settings and features that you can also try if it turns out not to be an Add\\-On conflict. If that resolves the issue remember safe mode only applies for this session so you will now want to resolve which add\\-on is causing firefox to freeze.\n\nFirst while in safe mode go to Tools \\> Add\\-Ons and disable all installed Add\\-Ons there that will make firefox run with no Add\\-Ons next time it is started in normal mode. At that point close firefox down and start it in normal mode to ensure it still runs without freezing and that all Add\\-Ons are indeed disabled.\n\nYour next course of action if this is all working still is to attempt to enable each Add\\-On you have in turn, restarting firefox in between each to identify the Add\\-On which is causing firefox to freeze note it could also be a combination of Add\\-Ons so in the event that enabling only one at a time does not cause the symptoms next try these steps.\n\nAfter running through every Add\\-On singly start enabling all your Add\\-Ons again restarting with each you enable until you produce the freeze, at that point you know that the last one you activated is conflicting with one of the others enabled prior. You can then use the safe mode trick to disable the others and try each of those candiates combined with just the last suspect Add\\-On you enabled to find the responsible pair of Add\\-Ons."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with Firefox freezing on Ubuntu 10.10.

Since momentum is conserved in the collision (assuming its elastic), some momentum of the moving particle is transferred to the stationary particle. As a result, the momentum of the moving particle decreases upon collision, an effect of the \"equal and opposite force\" exerted by the stationary particle. \n\nBut when it comes to gravitational (and electric) fields, Newton's Third Law seems to hold because of the equation $F\\=G\\\\frac{m\\_1m\\_2}{r^2}$. Also the previous example wouldn't make sense because the total momentum/kinetic energy of objects in a field is always changing (not conserved). **Edit**: The momentum is conserved, because the system here includes the earth which also experiences a force of equal magnitude. the system should be a closed system for momentum to be conserved.\n\nThe justifications for Newton's Third Law seem to vary from case to case. Would there be any way to relate the two above cases and other cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Newton's third law *doesn't* work for fields. There isn't even any way to state it for fields. (It's stated for instantaneous action at a distance between material particles, not for systems that include fields carrying their own momentum.) Consider the situation shown below, with two positive charges moving with the velocities indicated by the arrows.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Zkf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Zkf.jpg)\n\nThe electric forces are not equal and opposite, because the electric field of a moving charge is not spherically symmetric. The magnetic forces are not equal and opposite, because the magnetic force acting on 1 is zero, while the magnetic force acting on 2 is nonzero and upward. Momentum is still conserved, because momentum is being taken away from the system through electromagnetic radiation.\n\nRe the question of why Newton's third law is true, this depends on what principles you consider to be more fundamental than Newton's third law. You can't prove theorems unless you pick axioms to start with. If you ask most physicists today, they would probably say that conservation of momentum follows from translation symmetry via Noether's theorem, and Newton's third law is the only obvious way of making up a physical law that enforces conservation of momentum, in the special case of a system of point particles interacting through instantaneous action at a distance.\n\nWithin the more restrictive scenario of Newtonian systems of particles, another good justification for Newton's third law is that you need it for conservation of momentum, and without conservation of momentum you don't get conservation of energy. This is because requiring conservation of energy to hold in all frames of reference, not just in one frame, is equivalent to conservation of momentum."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the applicability and limitations of Newton's Third Law in different physical scenarios?\n\nA) Newton's Third Law applies universally to all physical interactions, including gravitational fields, electromagnetic fields, and particle collisions.\n\nB) Newton's Third Law applies only to particle collisions and gravitational fields, but breaks down for electromagnetic interactions.\n\nC) Newton's Third Law is valid for systems of particles interacting through instantaneous action at a distance, but doesn't work for field theories where momentum can be carried by the fields themselves.\n\nD) Newton's Third Law is an approximation that holds only for low-energy classical systems and breaks down completely in relativistic and quantum scenarios.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the limitations of Newton's Third Law as described in the given text. The law works well for systems of particles interacting through instantaneous action at a distance, which is the context in which it was originally formulated. However, it doesn't apply directly to field theories, such as electromagnetism, where the fields themselves can carry momentum and energy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text explicitly states that Newton's Third Law doesn't work for fields and there isn't even a way to state it for fields.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete. While the law does apply to particle collisions and can be used in gravitational calculations, it's not accurate to say it breaks down only for electromagnetic interactions. The issue is broader and applies to field theories in general.\n\nOption D goes too far in limiting the law's applicability. While it's true that Newton's Third Law is a classical concept and doesn't directly apply in quantum mechanics or relativistic scenarios, calling it merely an \"approximation\" for low-energy systems doesn't accurately represent its importance and wide applicability in classical mechanics."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/18", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/197275", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/105620/"], "docs_id": 197275, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been modeling data using a hybrid $k$\\-nearest neighbors (kNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) and have found the technique to be (at least with my data) much more accurate than either method alone.\nIn order to describe the technique, I will quickly describe kNN and MLR.\n\nIn both cases, we are given $n$ observations, say $(x\\_1, y\\_1, z\\_1\\),...,(x\\_n, y\\_n, z\\_n)$ where $x\\_i$ and $y\\_i$ are independent variables (not random) and $z\\_n$ is a dependent variable subject to some random noise. We want to predict the value of $z$ at some (unobserved) point $(x,y)$.\n\n**kNN regression:**\n\nFind the $k$ nearest observations to $(x,y)$ and average the corresponding $z$ values. Specifically, if the $k$ closes points to $(x,y)$ are $(x\\_1, y\\_1\\),...,(x\\_k, y\\_k)$ then we predict $z \\= \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{k} z\\_{k}$.\n\n**MLR:**\n\nWe predict $z$ by building a best fit surface (using least squares) and use the equation of the surface to predict $z$. E.g. we may want to model the surface with a degree 2 polynomial (in two variables), i.e. \n$$z \\= \\\\beta\\_1 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2 x \\+ \\\\beta\\_3 y \\+ \\\\beta\\_4 x^2 \\+ \\\\beta\\_5 xy \\+ \\\\beta\\_6 y^2\\.$$\nIn that case, we build matrices $X$ where the $i$th row of $X$ is $X\\_i \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\& x\\_i \\& y\\_i \\& x\\_i^2 \\& x\\_i y\\_i \\& y\\_i^2\\\\end{bmatrix}$ and $Z$ (a column matrix of the $z\\_i$ values), both matrices have $n$ rows. Then, we determine the coefficients $\\\\beta\\_i$ by solving the normal equations $\\\\beta \\= (X^{T}X)^{\\-1}X^{T}Z$.\n\n**Hybrid Method:**\n\nOne can view kNN method as building a degree 0 polynomial (constant) using only the $k$ nearest data points. The technique that I've used is to build a MLR model from the $k$ nearest neighbors (without the constraint that the polynomial be degree 0\\). We also don't require that the same model be used for every region\\-\\-a region being a set of points with the same $k$ nearest neighbors. We use $k$\\-fold cross validation to determine which polynomial degree is optimal\\-\\-when $k$ is small, of course the degree of the polynomial is small. This method feels like a natural relaxation/generalization of traditional kNN.\n\n**Question:** Does this hybrid approach have a name? Is it used frequently? If so, I would love any references that you can provide. I'm in the process of writing a paper that uses this modeling technique and I'd like to call it by the \"correct\" name (and cite original authors) or be able to honestly claim that it is novel.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe surface that is constructed with this method is akin to splines\\-\\-it is a piecewise polynomial model. However, it is different in that it is not differentiable (and in most cases) probably not even continuous.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There was a paper\n\n<https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176325632>\n\nAnn.

Which of the following best describes this hybrid method?\n\nA) A standard kNN regression with k=5 nearest neighbors\n\nB) A traditional MLR using all available data points\n\nC) A local MLR model built using only the k nearest neighbors, with the polynomial degree determined by cross-validation\n\nD) A global spline regression with continuous and differentiable piecewise polynomials\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe hybrid approach described in the documentation combines elements of kNN and MLR. It uses the k-nearest neighbors concept from kNN, but instead of simply averaging their values, it builds a local MLR model using only these k points. The polynomial degree for each local model is determined using k-fold cross-validation, allowing for flexibility in model complexity based on local data characteristics. This method differs from standard kNN (A) and traditional MLR (B) by localizing the regression and allowing for varying polynomial degrees. It's also distinct from global spline regression (D) as it's not necessarily continuous or differentiable at region boundaries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's just standard kNN, not the hybrid method. Option B is wrong as it uses all data points, not just local ones. Option D is incorrect because the resulting surface in this hybrid method is not guaranteed to be continuous or differentiable, unlike spline regression."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/10", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/511646", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/336218/"], "docs_id": 511646, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The shell script is expected to call only one function, but calling both.

For such radiation, the temperature of a body defines its radiation spectrum and its peak.\n\nThe EM radiation in fluorescent tube is not due to heat, but due to fluorescence, which is a type luminescence, defined as emission of light *not caused by heat*, but by other processes.\n\nMore specifically, in a fluorescent tube, UV photons are emitted by mercury vapor atoms, excited by fast moving charge carriers (sort of electroluminescence), and then visible light photons are emitted by phosphor coating atoms, excited by UV photons (fluorescence). Both steps here are forms of luminescence, not thermal radiation.\n\nSince fluorescent light is not due to thermal radiation, its temperature is not governed by black body radiation curves. Therefore, even though most of the EM radiation emitted by a fluorescent tube is in the visible light spectrum, its temperature is very low."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fluorescent lighting is correct?\n\nA) Fluorescent tubes emit light primarily through thermal radiation, similar to black body radiation.\nB) The temperature of a fluorescent tube can be accurately determined by analyzing its emission spectrum.\nC) The light emitted by a fluorescent tube is a result of electroluminescence and fluorescence, not thermal radiation.\nD) Fluorescent tubes have a high operating temperature due to the intense visible light they produce.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

creation type is: null\n\nAlthough we can see some trends we'd rather not make guesses or bad assumptions. So we have the following questions:\n\n1\\) What is the best way to know which of the four types of user we're looking at?\n\n2\\) Is there a simpler way to get the login (ideally as one field, we're trying to build this into a simple mapping)? Other than :\n\n```\nIf signInNames[0].value is not null use signInNames[0].value\nElseif otherMails[0] is not null use otherMails[0]\nElse userPrincipalName\n\n```\n\n3\\) Do other social users behave differently? (We've only done Facebook so far.)\n\n4\\) For social users what is the best way of knowing which identity provider is used?\n\n**UPDATE 11/8:**\n\n5\\) Why don't LocalAccount users get an otherMail value?\n\n6\\) Why don't non\\-LocalAccount users get sign\\-in names? I guess that was added exclusively for B2C?\n\n7\\) Also I guess end users don't really have the ability to associate social and local accounts today? (unless using an app which leverages graph).\n\n**UPDATE 11/8 \\#2:**\n\n8\\) Is it safe (for now) to assume that I can disambiguate a B2C signed\\-up individual who can only login with a social account using the following criteria:\n\n* creation type is: null \\- meaning they're not a Local User\n* userPrincipalName is prefixed with 'cpim\\_' followed by a UUID \\- meaning they are PROBABLY not a Standard or Guest user\n\nOr would there be a better method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1\\) These are not mutually exclusive properties. For example, a local account, guest or member user can also link their multiple social profiles to their account. The underlying data (available via Graph API) does not make any assumptions.\n\nThe most reliable way to know whether an account is a local user or not is to look at creationType property. You can also look at signInNames. Having said that, that would not imply that the user will not have their social profile linked in the future. It's just that this functionality is not exposed in B2C standard policies.\n\n2\\) `signInNames` is certainly used for signing in the user. However, a user can also have more than one `signInName` as far as the directory is concerned. That is why `signInNames` is a collection. So a utility company or bank may have an account id and email address both as `signInNames`.\n\n`otherMails` is not a property used to sign in a user. So you may want to skip that. Think of `otherMails` as an email address that is not used for any critical function by the directory (e.g. it's not used for sign in or for password resets etc.)\n\nYou would use `userPrincipalName` for work accounts.\n\n3\\) All social accounts are considered as external user identities, and are mapped in the same way. They are not yet available through Graph API, but when they are, they will appear as a collection too since a user may link to multiple social accounts.\n\n4\\) Not possible today, but coming in the future.\n\n**UPDATE 11/8** to answer additional questions\n\n5\\) Simply because there is no email address in B2C standard flow to add in `otherMails` for local account users. The email address they used to sign up is already in `signInNames` property. Through Graph API, you could add `otherMails`, and when a token is issued, it will show up in the `emails` claim even for local account users.\n\n6\\) Non\\-local account users do not get a `signInName` because they do not need to sign in using a `signInNames`. Work accounts use the `userPrincipalName` instead which can be tied to Office 365, Exchange, or on\\-premise AD. Social IDPs have external identities. So, there is no known scenario in which `signInNames` needs to be used for non\\-local accounts at least today.\n\n7\\) Yes, it is not possible today to link a social account with a local account through standard policies, but can be done through custom policies. It is also not yet possible through Graph API (because external identities are not yet exposed), but will be possible in the future when the API is exposed.\n\n**Update 11/24:**\n\n8\\) If you look at user principal name, you will notice it is random. cpim\\_ can be removed any time, it is not part of the contract. In fact, IMHO, it should be removed already so apps do not take a dependency on it.\n\nTo determine this correctly, we are expecting to announce a new \"userIdentities\" property on the user account, using which you can determine which social IDPs is the user account linked to. That would be the best way to do this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In Azure AD B2C, which of the following methods is the most reliable way to determine if a user account is a local account?\n\nA) Check if the userPrincipalName starts with \"cpim_\"\nB) Examine the otherMails property\nC) Look at the creationType property\nD) Check if signInNames is empty\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe most reliable way to determine if an account is a local user in Azure AD B2C is to look at the creationType property.

There are two ways to do this.\n\n1\\) Integrate with respect to $x$ first, then $y$. In this case, when integrating with respect to $x$, you assume you are at some fixed $y$ value. Then (using a sketch of the graph) you integrate with respect to $x$ starting at $0$ and finishing at $1\\-y$. Now you integrate with respect to $y$ from $0$ to $1$. So you'd get $$\\\\int\\_0^1\\\\int\\_0^{1\\-y} xy\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx\\\\,\\\\mathrm dy$$\n\n2\\) Integrate with respect to $y$ first, then $x$.

There are four possible types of changes in the conflict:\n\n1. Yours\n2. Theirs\n3. Both\n4.

Regarding cases 1 and 2 I'm not sure, but I'm thinking only changes of type 2 (Theirs) should prompt manual inspection. The reason being, you know what you changed, as opposed to \"their\" changes which may break your changes. So I'm thinking one could skip reviewing his own changes (case 1\\), and manually review / resolve the other changes (cases 2\\-4\\). \n\nOther developers suggested more extreme approaches \\- such as only reviewing conflicting (or \"both\") changes and trusting automerge for the rest. The other extreme is reviewing all the changes every time.\n\nOf course, other parameters may factor in. For example, if you only made a single correction to a file, and there are 200 changes made by others, then provided you can be reasonably sure that your change is unrelated (say it's an SQL file and you wrote a new separate stored procedure), perhaps you can skip reviewing the other changes.\n\nI am torn between the dangers of not inspecting changes and the time and energy that could be saved by trusting the automatic merge.

If you add to that that a lot of existing C code has been ported to C\\+\\+ and that the C\\+\\+ runtime environment did not offer that many aids to help you avoid memory leaks, you get a vast amount of legacy C\\+\\+ code that is not exception safe.\n\nThe initial lack of awareness about how to write exception\\-safe code also cause a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt, because exceptions worked so differently from the familiar flow control mechanisms that a lot of the common wisdom for writing robust applications had to be critically re\\-evaluated.\n\nNone of these problems exist for C\\# and Java because those languages only came along when exceptions were already much better understood, they have garbage collection so there is one major resource you don't have to look after that carefully and they don't have pre\\-exception legacy code."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What are the primary reasons why exceptions in C++ are often avoided, and how does this differ from languages like C# and Java?\n\nA) C++ exceptions are slower and less efficient than other error-handling methods, while C# and Java exceptions have negligible performance impact.\n\nB) C++ lacks proper documentation on exception handling, making it difficult for developers to implement, unlike the well-documented exception systems in C# and Java.\n\nC) Legacy code and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) are main reasons for avoiding exceptions in C++, while C# and Java were designed with exceptions in mind from the start.\n\nD) C++ exceptions are not supported by most compilers, whereas C# and Java have built-in exception handling mechanisms in all modern compilers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage explicitly states that the two main reasons for shunning exceptions in C++ are legacy code and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). It explains that when exceptions were introduced in C++, many developers lacked awareness about how to use them properly, leading to a large amount of non-exception-safe legacy code. Additionally, the unfamiliarity with exceptions caused fear and uncertainty among developers.\n\nIn contrast, C# and Java were developed when exceptions were better understood. These languages also benefit from garbage collection, which reduces resource management concerns, and they don't have pre-exception legacy code to deal with. This makes exception handling more straightforward and widely accepted in these languages.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect as they present information not supported by the given text.

Correct syntax is PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The error message \"Bad : modifier in $ (/)\" is typical of csh or tcsh shells when they encounter bash-style variable modification syntax. In bash, the colon inside curly braces would be interpreted as part of a variable expansion modifier. However, csh and tcsh interpret colons differently and don't require curly braces for modifiers, leading to this error.\n\nThe correct solution is to either switch to bash (using chsh or asking a system administrator to change it) or modify the syntax to be compatible with csh/tcsh. For csh/tcsh, you would typically use something like:\n\nsetenv PATH \"${PATH}:/usr/local/bin\"\n\nor\n\nset path = ($path /usr/local/bin)\n\nThis question tests understanding of shell differences, variable modification syntax, and common scripting errors."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/496673", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/168207/"], "docs_id": 496673, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a PHP script which downloads and manipulate an image from some server and then saves it locally.
