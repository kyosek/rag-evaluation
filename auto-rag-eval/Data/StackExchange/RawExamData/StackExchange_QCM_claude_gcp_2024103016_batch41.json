In your case, to buffer your points, it will always use WGS84 in degrees (Since WGS84 is a geographic coordinate system, and not a projected one).\n\nNotice, that changing the CRS by using \"set layer CRS\" does not change their actual values, It only says to QGIS \"from now on, read this values as if they are on this different CRS\". Wish would tell for instance that \"from now on read this degrees as if they are meter\", and that won't work well! :\\-P \n\nTherefore, it's very important that all your layers are set with their correct CRS. If on, QGIS \"On the fly transformation\" will read layers from different CRSs and display them in the Project chosen CRS. (thats why your layers work together)\n\nThe solution is very simple tho, all you need is to reproject you point data to a suitable projected CRS. For what I can see, the RGF93 / Lambert\\-93 is suitable for your working area.\n\n* Right\\-click \"points\" layer, and choose \"Save as...\";\n* Choose \"Selected CRS\" instead of \"Layer CRS\";\n* Browse for the desired CRS.

For example, if you consider the model of random regular graphs of degree $d$ (graphs chosen uniformly from all $d$ regular graphs on $n$ vertices), and let $X\\_i$ denote the number of cycles of length $i$, then Bollob\u00e1s and Wormald independently showed that the $X\\_i$ behaved asymptotically as independent Poisson variables with mean \n$(d\\-1\\)^i/(2i)$. \n\nIn other words: There's a positive probability that a graph contains each of $3$\\-cycles, $4$\\-cycles, etc. Because these events are asymptotically independent, \"most\" $d\\-$regular graphs have bounded girth. On the other hand, the number of cycles of each fixed length on average remains bounded even as the size of the graph tends to infinity. So if I fix a single vertex and look in the neighborhood of that vertex, I have to look at farther and farther distance before I see any cycles at all. (But not too far...as Louigi noted, we can't expect to go much past the $\\\\log n$ diameter of the graph).

However, since version 4\\.4, you can use its `readarray` builtin in combination with process substitution:\n\n```\nreadarray -td '' var < <(find . -type f -print0)\n\n```\n\n`readarray` stores each record from its input (here a pipe from `find` created via process substitution) as separate elements. With `-d ''`, the record separator is NUL instead of newline. With `-t`, the record delimiter is removed. It's not needed in current versions of bash as bash can't store NULs in its variables anyway, but we're adding it for future\\-proofing.\n\nTo loop over the elements, you'd do:\n\n```\nfor file in \"${var[@]}\"; do\n  something with \"$file\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nHere, you could also do without the array and loop directly over the output of `find` with:\n\n```\nwhile IFS= read -rd '' -u3 file; do\n  something with \"$file\"\ndone 3< <(find . -type f -print0)\n\n```\n\nSee also [Why is looping over find's output bad practice?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/321697) for how to properly loop over the files found by `find` in general.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 unless you tell it explicitly not to descend into some directories with `-prune` or `-xdev`, or with some `find` implementation limit the depth with `-maxdepth`.

Here `-type f` would end up also selecting symlinks to regular files.

Then it correctly iterates over the array elements using `\"${var[@]}\"`.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't use an array and will break on filenames with spaces.\nOption C is close but will still break on filenames with spaces or special characters during the array assignment.\nOption D uses a while loop which is a valid approach, but it uses newline as a delimiter instead of NUL, which can cause issues with certain filenames."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/07/22", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/628381", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/318307/"], "docs_id": 628381, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was delivered an STM32F407VGT6 with E3\\.

How do I take this switch out of the loop?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can probably replace the switches with those sensors, but you're going to have to do some creative wiring to work around the fact that they're not 3\\-way switches, but the switches you're replacing with them are. You'll likely end up with the light being on whenever either of the switches is on. You also might run into trouble if they ran the 3\\-way switches as a switch loop (no neutral in box), because \"smart switches\" like these require a neutral so they can use power for themselves to decide when to switch on and off.\n\nHere's what the difference between these wiring schemes looks like if you draw it out:\n\n![3-way switches, with neutral and as switch loop](https://i.imgur.com/wcUGG.jpg)\n\nAlso note that those occupancy sensors still have a hard\\-on switch, so your tenants can still just leave the lights on. You might want to look instead at vacancy sensors. (An example vacancy sensor is [Cooper Wiring Devices K01\\-400RW\\-L](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000ZOCSX8), but note that it does not handle CFLs, just incandescents.) These, you tap to turn them on, and they turn themselves *off* automatically when everyone's gone. That sounds more like what you want.\n\nThe how for switch \\#1 depends again on how they wired your \\#1 switches and the light they control together. If you diagram out the connections, it becomes straightforward. Until you have enough info to diagram it out, you don't have enough info to rewire it, either.\n\nAs an aside, all the exterior stairwell lights I've seen in apartment complexes were on timers. They'd come on around dark and flip off in the morning.

The initial stretching of the spring introduces potential energy into the system. When released, this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, causing the mass to move.

I am confused about what information the \"magnitude\" values of the transfer function are supposed to contain. I am mainly confused about why the magnitude can be negative. Is this a convention to aid in calculations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The magnitude is just the length of the *space diagonal* of an n\\-dimensional right rectangular prism. In two dimensions this is often just called the *diagonal* of a right rectangle or else the *hypotenuse*. And it is always a positive real number, as you say. (Never really zero, though it can approach it arbitrarily closely.)\n\nHowever, such numbers can also be expressed as logarithms, instead. An advantage gained by expressing positive numbers as logarithms is that multiplication of two positive real numbers can be performed by the addition of their equivalent logarithms, instead. (This fact was used on slide\\-rules, whose use has since fallen by the way because of the advent of computing machines.) Another advantage is that one can more quickly get an idea of the order of magnitude of \\\\$C\\\\$ and the dominance of \\\\$A\\\\$ vs \\\\$B\\\\$ by just a simple glance.\n\nSuppose you want to multiply two numbers, \\\\$A\\\\$ and \\\\$B\\\\$, so that you have to find \\\\$C\\\\$ where \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\\\$. You could instead use \\\\$a\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\$ and \\\\$b\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)\\\\$, sum the two to get \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$, and then find that \\\\$C\\=10^c\\\\$.\n\nIn short, you can say that \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\\\cdot 10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\:\\+\\\\:\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)}}\\\\$.\n\nBut this is really just the same thing as saying \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$.\n\nWhen you are doing a lot of multiplication (and division), using logarithms helps a lot.\n\nThe only issue is that now positive numbers that are less than 1 \\-\\- but still positive \\-\\- will be represented by negative values when turned into logarithms. That's just a quality of logarithms.\n\n2 is larger than 1 so its logarithm will be positive. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(2\\\\right)\\\\approx \\+0\\.30103\\\\$. But 0\\.5 is smaller than 1 so its logarithm will be negative. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(0\\.5\\\\right)\\\\approx \\-0\\.30103\\\\$. Note that if I wanted to multiply \\\\$2\\\\times\\\\frac12\\=1\\\\$ this is the same thing as addition of their logarithms, \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\-0\\.30103\\=0\\\\$, noting though that to get the final answer you perform \\\\$10^0\\=1\\\\$ (so 1 is the answer.)\n\nWith logarithms, a negative number is similar to division. So if you already know that \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\\\$ is the logarithm of 2 then if you notice the addition of a logarithm of \\\\$\\-0\\.30103\\\\$, then you know this means the same thing as division by 2\\. (Even though you are adding it.)\n\n*Amplification* multiplies and *attenuation* divides. Or you could say that *amplification* occurs when multiplying by a value larger than 1 (logarithm is positive) and that *attenuation* occurs when multiplying by a value less than 1 (logarithm is negative.) And you immediately know which is happening by just looking at the sign. So it's often convenient to use logarithms in electronics.\n\nThe only trick in electronics is that there are two common contexts \\-\\- power and voltage. For power, you multiply the logarithm by 10 and for voltage you multiply the logarithm by 20\\. So in the context of power you'd say an amplifier that doubles the power is the same thing as \\\\$\\+3\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. Or doubling the voltage is the same thing as \\\\$\\+6\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. (A few minor decimal points were tossed out.) It's a lot easier to talk about amplification and attenuation that way.

The voltage gain in dB is correct (12 dB), and the logarithmic value is correct (log\u2081\u2080(4) \u2248 0.6). However, the power gain in dB is incorrect. Power gain in dB is the same as voltage gain in dB when expressed this way.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. For voltage, we multiply the logarithm by 20. So, 20 * log\u2081\u2080(4) \u2248 20 * 0.6 = 12 dB. The logarithmic value log\u2081\u2080(4) \u2248 0.6 is correct.

The top answer suggests that it's \"something with the startup and not related to Ubuntu.\" This implies that the noise is a characteristic of the laptop model during the boot process, regardless of the installed operating system.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the issue occurs before the operating system fully loads, and it's reported on different operating systems.\n\nAnswer B is unlikely because the audio functions normally after boot, suggesting no persistent hardware malfunction.\n\nAnswer C is possible but less likely, as the issue is reported across different operating systems, indicating it's not a specific BIOS configuration problem.\n\nD is the most plausible explanation, as it accounts for the issue occurring on the same model with different operating systems, suggesting it's a characteristic of the hardware during startup."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/24", "source": ["https://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/17390", "https://meta.askubuntu.com", "https://meta.askubuntu.com/users/620831/"], "docs_id": 17390, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [What are some \u201cmust have\u201d Ubuntu programs?](https://askubuntu.com/q/27224/620831)\n\n> As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q\\&A format.

If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, [visit the help center](https://askubuntu.com/help/reopen-questions) for guidance.\n\nAfter reading every answers, I am not sure why is this kind of question a violation of intergalatic rules. To summarize, the rules are :\n\n* Questions must be supported by :\n\t+ Facts\n\t+ References\n\t+ Expertise\n* Question must not solicit :\n\t+ Debate\n\t+ Arguments\n\t+ Polling\n\t+ Extended discussion\n\nHowever, in the answers that I've read, this question seems very legitimate and fits very well the established infrastructure of StackExchange and in its Q\\&A format. Saying that `this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format` is a lie.\n\nWhile the question remains a subjective one, one can draw objective conclusions by using subjective questions and answers or at least get something positive out of it. I don't think that this question is the Devil's spawn.\n\nThe answers are indeed supported by facts, references and users' own expertise and does solicit debate, polling and extended discussion. However, is that a bad thing? It you look at [In Android 6, how to deny an app permission to access the network?](https://android.stackexchange.com/q/138311/199649), you'll notice that, while there is indeed an objective answer to the question, there's also alternatives provided by the community to still answer the question in a subjective manner.\n\nBecause this website is so often a first hit on Google, I think that being open to discussion and seeking extended discussion is important.\n\nAnd, mostly, this question and its answers **are constructive**.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I may partly agree with you, in that the **not constructive** close reason was confusing and we don't use it anymore. I'm sorry it ever did exist\\-\\-or, really, mainly just that it was *called* that. It's not one of the close reasons that can be selected today. However, that question shouldn't be reopened. We would still close it if it were asked today, we would just be able to select a close reason that makes more sense. I think three of [our current close reasons](https://askubuntu.com/help/closed-questions) apply:\n\n* **Too broad.** There's really no limit to how many distinct answers could be posted. And if a single answer tried to address a large chunk of the question, it would be enormous, at least if it tried to explain its judgments. In the case of this particular sort of question, requesting a big list of answers, this overlaps with \"primarily opinion\\-based\" too (see below).\n* **Unclear.** What does \"must have\" mean? Does it mean \"greatly beneficial\"? Does it mean \"really cool and you will tell your friends\"? Does it mean \"your system isn't worth using without it\"? Does it mean \"good to know about\"? Does it mean \"more than X% of users will like it?\"\n* **Primarily opinion based.** There was hardly any standard by which to judge the appropriateness of the answers besides personal opinion. The question was not an explicit call for discussion, and to a limited extent facts and experience were *a factor* in determining what people would post and how people would vote on them. But mostly arbitrary opinions\\-\\-that is, personal preference\\-\\-was the *major factor* governing what answers would exist and how well they would be received. The top\\-voted answer recommended VLC. Why was that something people \"must have\"? Did those votes really reflect that VLC was the *most important* program to install? Did they reflect that it was important *at all*? Or did they just reflect that VLC is *generally well\\-liked*?\n\nThe question was not just subjective in the sense of not having any provably best answer, which is true of many perfectly good questions. It fell afoul of the problem that [just about every answer that might plausibly be posted was equally valid](https://askubuntu.com/help/dont-ask). This part of the existing closure explanation applied fully:\n\n> We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or expertise\n\nThe question itself contains some hints that it was never actually a good fit for our site:\n\n* If you look at what most of the text in the question is doing, it is mostly giving advice about *the special and different way one has to use the site* to answer it appropriately.\n* It emphasizes searching\\-\\-not reading, or skimming, or perusing, but *searching*\\-\\-the existing answers before posting another. That is, it was expected that most people would not actually consider what the existing answers said before writing their own. It was expected that there would be so many answers that most people who came to the question would not look at all of them.\n\nThis is to say that **the question was in effect a poll asking people what their favorite software was**, and not something that could practically answer a new Ubuntu user's question about what additional software they would be well advised to install on a fresh Ubuntu system.\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, the question was really a duplicate of [What are the most useful programs installed after setup of a vanilla Ubuntu?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1237/what-are-the-most-useful-programs-installed-after-setup-of-a-vanilla-ubuntu) which was subsequently deleted by a moderator. (If this question had remained open for longer, or if we were to reopen it now, more effort would go into and then it would still likely be closed eventually and then deleted, too, either by a moderator or from community members' delete votes.)\n\nThere's an argument to be made that the other, original, deleted question should not have been deleted by a moderator but should instead have been deleted through the gradual accumulation of community members' delete votes, or even that it should have been preserved with [a historical lock](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/13506/22949). But the question you've asked about was just a rehash of it, is unlikely to warrant special treatment, will likely be deleted eventually, and would likely have been deleted a while ago if it had captured more attention. After all, it says:\n\n> Inspired by this [question](https://superuser.com/questions/1241/what-are-some-must-have-windows-programs).

Let me illustrate what I mean with a graphical example:\n\nInput\n-----\n\nSuppose I have the following MultiLineString: `MULTILINESTRING ((120 105, 140 98),(160 103, 140 98),(100 100, 120 105))`\n[![Input MultiLineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)\n\nNote how, to our human eyes, it seems out of order: the first (orange) segment is in the middle, the second (green) segment is coded backwards in relation to the other segments (i.e., pointing to the left instead of to the right).\n\nDesired Output\n--------------\n\nThe desired output would be the following LineString: `LINESTRING (100 100, 120 105, 140 98 160 103)`\n\n[![Output LineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)\n\nNote how the output is now looks much more sensible.

My approach has two different steps:\n\n* Extract unique coordinates\n* Sort unique coordinates\n\nI've been able to do the first part quite easily, but it's not clear to me how to reorder the points.\n\nI thought about a heuristic that would find the point that is cumulatively furthest to all other points, label that as the starting point, add all other points to a pool of unsorted points and then sequentially find the next closest point until I run out of unsorted points.\n\nHowever, this sorting heuristic would fail in A BUNCH of cases: consider a geometry that describes a spiral. Or a strong zig\\-zagging pattern. Or a geometry with a bunch of self\\-intersections. This heuristic would just fail completely.\n\nTherefore, I suspect this approach of extracting unique points and sorting them isn't the right one.\n\nBack to the start\n-----------------\n\nSo, I'm back to my main question: how can I sort the coordinates of a `MultiLineString` such that they make more intuitive sense?\n\nReproducible example and code\n-----------------------------\n\nHere's the Python code for my very incomplete solution thus far.\n\n```py\nimport shapely\n\n# Write the MultiLineString WKT\nmls_wkt = 'MULTILINESTRING ((120 105, 140 98),(160 103, 140 98),(100 100, 120 105))'\n\n# Generate the shapely geometry\nmls = shapely.wkt.loads(mls_wkt)\n\n# Function that extracts unique coordinate values\ndef get_unique_points(input_multilinestring):\n    # Gets a nested list of coordinates\n    coords_nested = [list(this_geom.coords) for this_geom in input_multilinestring.geoms]\n\n    # Flattens the list\n    coords = [item for sub_list in coords_nested for item in sub_list]\n\n    # Gets only the unique coords\n    coords_set = set()\n    coords_final = []\n    for i,coord in enumerate(coords):\n        if coord not in coords_set:\n            coords_set.add(coord)\n            coords_final.append(coord)\n    return coords_final\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You might be able to just use [`shapely.ops.linemerge`](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#shapely.ops.linemerge).

This combination provides the best support for a double AD composition with Kayle top lane. \n\nAnivia offers significant utility and crowd control (CC) abilities, which allow the AD carries to deal damage safely. Her wall can split enemy teams, her area-of-effect (AoE) slow affects entire teams, and she has a stun ability. These skills make it difficult for enemies to reach the AD carries.\n\nNautilus, as a jungler, brings tankiness and multiple CC abilities (4 in total) to protect the AD carries. His durability helps compensate for the potentially lower HP of the AD top laner (Kayle).\n\nTogether with Kayle's ultimate, this composition creates a strong protective environment for the AD carries, allowing them to deal damage while being difficult to reach or kill.\n\nWhile options A and D include tanky champions with CC, they don't offer the same level of utility and protection as the Anivia-Nautilus combination.

Perhaps the required context or assumptions are provided by the previous sections in the textbook.\n\nIf the water level in the well remains 20m below ground level while water is pumped out, and that of the tank at 10m above, then every litre of water is raised through a height of 30m. The same reasoning applies if the water is initially at ground level and the depth of water in the well is 20m. Judging by the answer, perhaps the key insight is that the reservoir of water below ground is so vast that the level of water in the well is not affected by removing 22380 litres. This also assumes that the rate at which water is removed is less that the rate at which it can seep back into the well through its walls and base. \n\nHowever, if the level of water in the well and/or the storage tank changes, then the calculation is not so straightforward. You can only decide if this is the case from the situation described in the question. If the situation is not described adequately in the question or its context, then there is no way of knowing what the author intended."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A pump is used to transfer water from a well to an elevated tank.

The total height the water needs to be lifted is 30m (20m from well bottom to ground level + 10m from ground to tank). The work done is W = mgh = 22380 kg * 10 m/s^2 * 30m = 6,714,000 J.

It does not impose any specific slot population requirements.\nAdvanced Error Correction Code (ECC) mode extends SDDC from x4 DRAM based DIMMs to both x4 and x8 DRAMs. This protects against single DRAM chip failures during normal operation. The restriction is that memory modules must be identical in size, speed, and technology. Identical DIMMs are installed in matched pair. Since you can order a server from start with this type of module compliance, there's no problem using AECC instead of optimized.\n\nNote that both optimized and AECC modes will let the **full amount of memory** be usable.\n\nIf power is fine which it should be on a server, there is no actual reason for RAM modules to have problems, the probability of that is low.\n\nIf you want to make sure you don't have to open up the server in the low chance case of a memory failure, you may choose spare mode. In this mode, one rank per channel is reserved as a spare. If persistent correctable errors are detected on a rank, the data from this rank is copied to the spare rank, and the failed rank is disabled. The memory available to the operating system is reduced by one rank per channel.\n\nFor example, in a dual\\-processor configuration with 16x 4 GB single\\-rank memory modules, the available system memory is: **3/4** (ranks/channel) \u00d7 16 (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 48 GB, and not 16 1x (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 64 GB.\n\nMirroring is like a RAID 1 for memory. The bad part is that in a mirrored configuration, the total available system memory is one half of the total installed physical memory, exactly like with HDDs in RAID 1\\. So if you really need maximum protection you an choose this one but in your case you will have only 192 GB (**half**) to work with.\n\nFault Resilient Memory (FRM) is an operating mode introduced in newer PowerEdge servers. The mode establishes an area of memory that is fault resilient and can be used by hypervisors such as VMware ESXi to load vmkernel, critical applications or services to maximize system availability. The operating systems uses the resilient region exposed from the platform and map the process\u2019s address ranges to enforce resiliency. This is good to be used for ESXi installations. FRM creates a highly resilient memory zone for the hypervisor, protecting it from severe memory errors. With the VMware Reliable Memory feature, vSphere 5\\.5 and later revisions can take advantage of this zone, providing the hypervisor with a strong protection from memory faults that would bring down the entire system."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is configuring memory settings for a new server and wants to maximize protection against memory failures while still maintaining full memory capacity.

The maximum value of S is indeed t, but it can only be approached as a limit, not achieved exactly. This is because the optimal solution involves a sequence of limits:\n\n1. First, $p_1 \\to 0^+$, making the first term approach 1.\n2. Then, $N_1 \\to 0^+$, eliminating the influence of the first term on subsequent terms.\n3. This process is repeated for each term: $p_2 \\to 0^+$, then $N_2 \\to 0^+$, and so on.\n\nThis sequence of limits allows each term to approach 1 in turn, without being affected by previous terms. However, this process can't be achieved with finite, non-zero values, explaining why the maximum of t can only be approached but not exactly reached.\n\nOption A is incorrect because S can approach t arbitrarily closely.\nOption B is incorrect because the maximum can't be achieved with non-zero values.\nOption D is incorrect because t is indeed the tight upper bound, regardless of specific values."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/05/16", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/619906", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/313479/"], "docs_id": 619906, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is purely about synthesized verliog, not simulated.\n\nI have read that blocking assignments are executed in order, but also that blocking assignments assign values to the RHS **immediately**.
