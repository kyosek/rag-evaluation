These reference codes correspond to a transaction code that is stored in a database. As of now, there are 15 difference transaction codes.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nTranasction Code - Reference Code\nBB01             - 48912388\nC949             - X717-9999\n\n```\n\nand so on...\n\nNew transaction codes can be added at any time. Whether the transaction code is new or not, all corresponding reference codes must be in a certain format. I plan on using regular expressions to validate the reference codes using Javascript.\n\nNow here's the question.\n\n1. Am I better off doing something like this\n\n```\nvar transactionCode = $('input[name=TransactionCode]').val();\nvar referenceCode = $('input[name=ReferenceCode]').val();\n\n// Do this type of test for all 15 types of reference codes until I\n// succeed\nif (transactionCode === 'BB01') {\n    var results = /\\d{8}/.test(referenceCode);\n    // if results is true, blah blah blah\n}\n\n```\n2. Create a SQL table of reference codes and matching regexs. Query the database and construct a javascript object (similar to a dictionary/hash of key value pairs) when needed where I pass the reference code as a key to retrieve the regex to validate against my transaction code.\n\nThe second approach seems like overkill for a small data set. But the advantage is I don't have to hard\\-code my transaction codes when testing and when more codes are added or removed, I don't have to manually mess with them in JavaScript. Where as if I take the first approach, I have to hard code my transaction codes.

Which approach offers the best balance of flexibility and maintainability for handling a growing number of transaction codes?\n\nA) Implement a series of if-statements in JavaScript to check each transaction code and its corresponding reference code format.\n\nB) Create a SQL table to store transaction codes and their associated regex patterns, querying this table as needed to validate reference codes.\n\nC) Use a single complex regex pattern in JavaScript that can validate all possible reference code formats simultaneously.\n\nD) Store the transaction codes and regex patterns in a client-side JavaScript object, updating it manually when new codes are added.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B provides the best balance of flexibility and maintainability. By storing transaction codes and their associated regex patterns in a SQL table, the system becomes more dynamic and easier to maintain. This approach allows for easy addition or modification of transaction codes without changing the JavaScript code. It also centralizes the validation rules, making them easier to manage and update.\n\nOption A, while simple for a small set of codes, becomes unwieldy and hard to maintain as the number of transaction codes grows. It requires modifying JavaScript code each time a new code is added or changed.\n\nOption C is impractical and error-prone, as creating a single regex to handle all possible formats would be extremely complex and difficult to maintain or modify.\n\nOption D improves on A by using a JavaScript object, but still requires manual updates to client-side code when changes occur, which is less ideal than a server-side solution.\n\nThe SQL table approach (B) allows for easier scalability, centralized management of validation rules, and doesn't require changes to the JavaScript code when adding or modifying transaction codes."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/09", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/121121", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/2552/"], "docs_id": 121121, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an existing 42\" diameter x 11' deep underground water cistern installed in my backyard that I am starting to use for irrigation. It has HDPE walls and poured concrete bottom. There is no waterproofing applied to it, and so water stored in it slowly seeps into the ground until it reaches 6' full, which appears to be the height of the groundwater.\n\nHowever, when pumped dry, the tank starts filling up with water immediately, and after about an hour fills to its maximum fill height of 6'. Thus, I can't pump the tank dry to use most waterproofing chemicals, which ask for the concrete to be dry.\n\nWhat can I do to waterproof the tank?\nPotability, while not required (this is an irrigation cistern), would be nice in case I needed to ever drink this water in a SHTF situation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the potability standpoint I think you will want to definitely plan to have high performance hand operated water filter unit available to filter any water you would try to drink from this tank. Check at a place like REI to find a filter like the type used by canoeists when they make trips on rivers and lakes and filter lake water for drinking.\n\nIt seems to me that it is going to be very difficult to get this tank dry enough to seal it. One way that may work is to dig down five or six holes that are about a foot in diameter to a depth of maybe 13 to 14 feet deep (i.e. a good amount below the existing concrete tank floor). Then insert a sump type pump into the bottom of each hole that pumps out accumulated water as fast as it can accumulate. You would want to spill the pumped water out in the street or rain sewer so as to carry the water away from your cistern area. It is possible that this could lower the water table near the tank bottom enough to keep it dry for a period of time. \n\nOf course you would want to do this at a time of the year when there has been little or no rain for a goodly length of time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has an underground water cistern that fills with groundwater up to 6 feet when emptied.

The simpler ones have a fully diff output, i.e. the output is not referenced to ground but is the difference between two terminals. You build the usual non inverting amp with the inputs and the positive output, and feed \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V to the negative output. This *might* work but not all op amps like an output to be set to a specific voltage.\n\nIf you can use an instrumentation amplifier that would be much better. It is not an opamp but it is a single component. INAMPS need no external feedback, that's built in, and they usually have some very precise preset gain, or you can set it eithger with a control voltage or digitally. The output usually have a reference terminal: that is where you want to hook your \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V, and that terminal is though exactly for this purpose.\n\nTo vary the offset you can set the ref voltage with a potentiometer, maybe add some safety resistors in order to not let the ref terminal swing the full \\\\$\\\\pm 15\\\\$V: the inamp might not like it as well as your subsequent circuit.\n\nAs hinted in the comments, if your supplies are not well regulated using a mere divider to get the \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V won't work: you will need a linear regulator and a divider after that.\n\nIf you absolutely need to do that with a single ended, single op amp there is a circuit:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4Icl.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fU4Icl.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nSome analysis leads to:\n$$\nV\\_{out} \\= \\\\left(1\\+\\\\frac{R\\_2}{R\\_1}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{R\\_3\\+R\\_4}\\\\left(V\\_sR\\_4\\+ER\\_3\\\\right) \n$$\nthat is in the form \\\\$V\\_{out}\\=\\\\alpha V\\_s \\+ \\\\beta E\\\\$ with \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\beta\\\\$ positive. \n\nJust work out some values for the resistors if you want to build this last circuit, but the INAMP solution is the best you can get.\n\n**pros and cons** of each solution:\n\n**INAMP** pros: it's designed to do what you want, your only concern is the offset voltage but that is a concern for every solution. cons: costs and power consumption.\n\n**FULLY DIFF AMP** pros: it's easy and cheap to set up, costs and power are just like a single ended opamp. cons: it probably won't work since you try to set one of the output rails to a fixed voltage\n\n**SINGLE OPAMP** pros: dirty cheap and easy, fits the spec. cons: do you see that ton of resistors? they are bad. they are not precise, they need space, they are bad creatures.

Educating team members to stop commenting out code and instead delete unnecessary code directly eliminates the need for complex marking systems or tools. Encouraging everyone to remove commented-out code when they encounter it promotes ongoing code cleanliness. This approach aligns with best practices in version control, where old code can be retrieved from the version history if needed, making commented-out code unnecessary.

The photons that get emitted towards the center of the Sun (by the electrons in higher energy states that absorbed a photon earlier) would get absorbed again when they hit a different electron (and then re\\-emitted) and would eventually make it out. So why don't absorption and emission lines cancel out in our Sun?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that this is a very good question.\n\nIn my answer I will only mention the formation of one of the absorption lines, the 589 nm of sodium, and I will call the photon associated with that wavelength a \"sodium photon\".  \n\nWhat I will try to explain with reference to that particular wavelength of light will be true for all the other wavelengths for which absorption occurs.\n\nThe schematic layout of a standard demonstration of absorption and emission lines is shown below.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAAwu.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAAwu.jpg)\n\nAt position $A$ one would see an absorption spectrum and at position $B$ an emission spectrum and the \"re\\-radiated in all directions\" explanation works very well.\n\nThe difference with the Sun is that the \"sodium flame\" envelopes the Sun and the rate of \"sodium photons\" emerging from the Sun is less than the rate of emergence of photons with comparable wavelengths.\n\nI think that the OP is asking \"Where do the re\\-radiated sodium photons go?\"\n\nThe fact is that the rate at which sodium photons escape from the \"sodium flame blanket\" around the Sun (the Sun's outer layers) is smaller than the rate at which photons close in wavelength escape.\n\nSo in effect that outer layer of the Sun is fairly opaque to sodium photons.\n\nAs the sodium photons which are being produced in the internal layers of the Sun progress through the outer layers of the Sun they get absorbed and re\\-radiated so the net rate in the forward (away from the Sun) direction decreases and there is a flux of sodium photons heading back towards the Sun.  \n\nHere they interact with the hotter \"inner\" layers of the Sun and do not necessarily emerge again as sodium photons, their wavelength is changed.  \n\nThey are thermalised (I cannot think of a better wording).  \n\nThose sodium photons enter regions within the Sun where they they are in excess of what might expect for the distribution of wavelength for the temperature of those inner layers.  \n\nInteractions within those layers reduce that excess number of sodium photons, so they cease to be sodium photons.\n\nSo the net effect is that the \"sodium flame blanket\" around the Sun sends back towards the Sun sodium photons which are then transformed into photons of other wavelengths.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for the appearance of absorption lines in the Sun's spectrum, despite the re-emission of absorbed photons?\n\nA) The re-emitted photons always escape the Sun's atmosphere at random angles, never reaching Earth.\nB) The outer layers of the Sun act as an opaque filter for specific wavelengths, reducing their overall emission rate.\nC) Re-emitted photons are always converted to different wavelengths before leaving the Sun's surface.\nD) The absorption and emission processes occur at different depths in the Sun, preventing cancelation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The outer layers of the Sun act as an opaque \"blanket\" for specific wavelengths, such as the sodium line at 589 nm. As photons of these wavelengths try to escape the Sun, they are repeatedly absorbed and re-emitted. This process reduces the net rate at which these specific wavelengths emerge from the Sun compared to nearby wavelengths.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while some re-emitted photons do escape at random angles, this alone doesn't explain the persistent absorption lines.\n\nAnswer C is not entirely accurate. While some re-emitted photons may be converted to different wavelengths in the hotter inner layers of the Sun, this is not true for all re-emitted photons.\n\nAnswer D is partially true but doesn't fully explain the phenomenon.

This technique taken to the extreme would involve using a power and ground plane and surrounding the entire chip with bypass capacitors, or if you have the money to spare, using buried capacitance planes, but simply using two caps at either side of the package makes a large and measurable difference (as opposed to just at the VCC side) (I'm too lazy to look it up but I think we're talking 10dB\\+ improvement).\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6f6x.jpg)\n\nEDIT: Added my cheesy drawing.

They're also great for doing exploratory testing, so they find the things that automated tests can't (for instance, one of my favourite testers spotted that I'd put an SQL call in the wrong place and that a particular behaviour was making 10 calls to the DB where it only needed to do 1\\).\n\nI tend to refer to \"tester\" these days rather than \"QA\", since assuring quality is indeed, as gurun said, more than just one person and a bit of process."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the primary difference between developers and testers in the software development process, according to the given text?\n\nA) Developers write code, while testers only find bugs.\nB) Developers focus on the \"solution space,\" while testers concentrate on the \"problem space.\"\nC) Developers perform unit testing, while testers conduct integration testing.\nD) Developers use TDD, while testers use BDD.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The text clearly contrasts developers and testers by describing developers as \"solution space\" people who are skilled at solving problems and creating abstractions, even with incomplete information.

Even though a laser beam is very narrow, it does spread out, and by the time it reaches the moon it will be a couple of hundred meters wide. The moon is not very reflective (with an albedo it only reflects 1/8th of the light falling on it). Thet reflected light is spread out further by the roughness of the lunar surface so that, by the time it arrives back on earth, it probably covers the entire earth, and the amount of light falling on your eye is minuscule.\n\nThe Apollo astronauts left special reflectors on the moon.

While a laser beam starts very narrow, it spreads out over long distances. By the time it reaches the Moon (384,400 km away), it would cover an area of several hundred meters. Additionally, the Moon's surface is not very reflective (with an albedo of only 1/8), and its rough surface further scatters the light. As a result, the reflected light that returns to Earth is extremely diffuse and weak, making it impossible to see with the naked eye. Only with specialized equipment, like those used by scientists to measure the Earth-Moon distance using reflectors left by Apollo astronauts, can such reflected laser light be detected.

The documentation suggests that the WAU's primary purpose was to maintain life support and preserve human life on the station. After the destruction of life on the surface, the WAU appears to have taken extreme measures to prolong human life below, including using available resources like legacy scans and structure gel to revive or create new forms of life. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the WAU may have created proxies, the primary goal seems to be preservation rather than study.\n\nAnswer B is plausible but too narrow in scope. While the WAU might be testing structure gel's capabilities, this would be a means to an end rather than the main purpose.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no evidence in the provided information that the WAU intentionally created mobile entities for repair purposes.

When I generate variable frequency pulses by using a micro controller does that mean I am suing the inner clock and the pulses are not accurate enough? Some tutorials play with the registers and obtain any pulse frequency. \n\nMy question is, for example if I use AVR such like in Arduino Uno board and play with the registers does that mean I will use the inner clock? Is there a way to obtain more accurate pulses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"inner\" clock, you mean the internal RC oscillator that comes with the device from the factory. It is inside the chip, and is not very accurate over temperature range, which means it will not actually be the frequency that you assume it is, and indeed it may have a lot of \"jitter\" which means the clock generated from the internal oscillator will not have very \"precise\" timing, one clock pulse might be \\+\\-10\\-\\>15% different to the one before it, and the one after it. This is bad for cycle\\-by\\-cycle timing.\n\nThe use of external crystals allows you to have faster clock speeds than that possible with the internal source available in your given example (Atmel ATMEGA328P which is on the Arduino Uno), and these provide (usually! Quality and material are relevant here) very good *accuracy* and cycle\\-by\\-cycle *precision* of the clock signal.\n\nThe system clock is generated from these different possible sources, so if you use a bad accuracy/quality source and expect high speed and timing, you will have problems. Use a good crystal, and you can very nicely time things, such as a very precise/accurate digital signal at a set frequency (given the limitations of timers mentioned below). \n\nThe registers that you mention are the perhaps those which allow you to change the CLKDIV options, which allows you to divide an input clock source frequency and make the system clock slower which uses less power, and may give better timing characteristics. The output of the system clock signal may sometimes be selected for one of the microcontroller pins, to clock external devices with a nice clean digital clock \\- for example, a Camera IC, or a reference clock input for synchronous devices. \n\nThe timers inside the microcontrollers use the main clock source, and often have dividers you can set for them separately. From the resulting timer speed, you can then set \"output compare\" registers, which allows you to choose (based on the resolution!) a certain point where the timer will reset \\- you may have this essentially act as a digital pulse generator, of reasonably good control of the frequency up to a certain point. 8 Bit timers will allow you to choose an output in steps of 1\\-255, and 16 bit timers allow you to set a step size of 1\\-\\>65536\\. Using a 16 bit timer and a very good quality clock source input would yield the \"best\" output.\n\nThe Atmega328P on the Arduino Uno has multiple timers, so you could make the output compare channels produce more than one custom/adjustable frequency pulse signal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a system that requires precise timing for multiple output signals.

External crystal oscillators provide better accuracy and precision compared to internal RC oscillators, which can have up to 10-15% variation.\n2. 16-bit timers offer higher resolution (1-65536) compared to 8-bit timers (1-255), allowing for more precise control of pulse frequencies.\n3. Output compare registers allow for fine-tuning of the timer reset points, enabling the generation of custom frequency pulses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the less accurate internal RC oscillator and lower resolution 8-bit timers.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it relies on software delays, which are less precise than hardware timers, and doesn't take advantage of the microcontroller's timing features.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although it uses clock dividers, it still relies on the less accurate internal RC oscillator, which won't provide the level of precision required for this application."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/11", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/169863", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/61447/"], "docs_id": 169863, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using the WMS interface of GeoServer to retrieve raster data.

This is correct. The Type C ports on your Mac conform to the [USB\\-PD (Power Delivery Spec)](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/275566/119271) meaning it will negotiate for the maximum charge.\n\nThe default charge that comes from a USB\\-PD device starts out at 5V \\- this, coincidentally is the same voltage that legacy USB chargers output. If it can negotiate up (to a max of 20V) it will do so. Otherwise, it will simply draw the maximum which is no more than 12W (5V at 2\\.4A)\n\nSo, if you use a 5W charger (airplane, car, etc.), it will take *forever* to charge that MacBook (you'll drain battery if you attempt to use it while charging), but it will charge.

As for the power draw, it will draw what it can \\- if the airplane only supplies 5W; that's all you'll get.\n\nYour best bet is to get a proper USB\\-C travel charger and hopefully the airplane will have the 12V sockets (car cigarette lighter port) rather than USB ports.\n\nAs for the cables you need, if it's a USB\\-A port, just the USB\\-C to A adapter you already referenced and a USB\\-C cable which you should already have."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A traveler with a new MacBook Air (USB-C model) wants to charge their laptop during a long flight.

The MacBook Air with USB-C can indeed be charged using a standard USB port on an airplane through a USB-C to USB-A adapter. However, the charging will be very slow due to the limited power output of typical airplane USB ports (usually 5W or 10W). This slow charging may not be enough to increase the battery level if the laptop is being used, especially for demanding tasks. The charging will occur, but it may only serve to extend the battery life rather than fully recharge the device. Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent the charging capabilities.

default width of the first column in the invoice table is hard-coded to 5cm. To modify this, the answer provides a solution by introducing a new command \\MyInvoiceWidth which defaults to 5cm. This can be changed using the \\renewcommand*{\\MyInvoiceWidth}{newwidth} syntax, where newwidth is the desired width (e.g., 3cm). Option B correctly describes both the default width and the method to modify it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the default width is 5cm, not 3cm, and the command name is incorrect.\nOption C is incorrect because the default width is 5cm, not 4cm, and there is no \\setinvoicewidth command in the provided solution.\nOption D is partially correct about the default width but incorrectly states that it cannot be modified without redefining the entire environment, which is not true given the provided solution."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/20", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/800463", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/145033/"], "docs_id": 800463, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just bought this laptop (Lenovo Ideapad Y50\\).\n\nI'm playing games such as Battlefield 4 (upto date DLC) and WatchDogs.

Registry modifications can force it to maintain high performance.\nD) The game settings are automatically adjusting based on power source. Manually setting graphics options in-game would resolve the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question describes a common issue with gaming laptops where performance drops significantly when unplugged, even with high-performance settings. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. NVIDIA cards have built-in power-saving features that automatically reduce performance when running on battery power, regardless of user preferences.\n2. This behavior matches the symptoms described, where FPS drops substantially when unplugged.\n3. The documentation mentions that registry modifications can force the graphics card to maintain high performance on battery power, though this will drain the battery much faster.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while heat can cause throttling, it wouldn't be tied specifically to being unplugged. Answer B is unlikely as the laptop performs well when plugged in. Answer D is possible but less likely, as most games don't automatically change settings based on power source, and the performance difference is too significant for this to be the primary cause."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/14", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/418733", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/414397/"], "docs_id": 418733, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a bit new to the topic of servers, ip addresses (public and private), ports, networking, and how all of this stuff ties together.\n\nPlaying around, I managed to run apache on my mac and get an html page up and running on localhost.

This update was designed to prevent potential damage to Mac computers when using these third-party accessories. The question mentions that the update resolved issues with \"3rd party USB-C chargers\" and provides a link to an article titled \"Apple releases macOS update to prevent damage from third-party docks and dongles.\" This clearly indicates that the main purpose of the update was to protect Macs from potential harm caused by incompatible or problematic third-party USB-C accessories.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the content provided in the documentation.

A more concise answer is to start up emacs and, in your Lisp evaluation buffer, type `user-init-file` and press `Ctrl`\\+`J` to evaluate.

Evaluating \"user-init-file\" in the Lisp buffer will directly print out the path to your init file.\n\nC) While this method might work in many cases, it's not always reliable. The .emacs file is often in the home directory, but it's not guaranteed to be there, especially if you've customized your Emacs setup.\n\nD) This is the incorrect answer. The \"locate\" command searches your entire filesystem for files matching a pattern, which is not specific to Emacs and may return incorrect or multiple results.

I want to know how to minimize complications when using the release upgrade offered in Ubuntu.\n\nI have read about [removing PPAs before upgrading](https://askubuntu.com/q/50803/385212).

By setting up the new version on a separate machine, you can thoroughly test compatibility and performance without disrupting the current workflow. This method allows for extensive testing and troubleshooting without time pressure, ensuring that when the switch is made, the new system is fully functional and reliable.

It seems that the drift (several minutes per day) was caused by having time synchronization both provided by NTP inside the VM and VMware tools. We solved our problem by disabling time synchronization in the [VMware tools properties](http://www.vmware.com/support/ws45/doc/new_guest_toolsconfig_ws.html) (in the VM properties in ESX). After that NTP was able to keep the clock in synch with a remote time server. If you prefer to edit the `.vmx` file manually, [set `tools.syncTime = \"0\"`](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1006427).\n\nStopping NTP inside the VM and letting the tools synch the time would probably work as well, at least to correct the server drift. ESX itself can run an NTP daemon. [VMware's timekeeping best practices](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1006427) recommend using NTP instead of VMWare Tools for time synchronization.\n\nVMware publishes a lengthy [paper on timekeeping in VMware virtual machines](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/Timekeeping-In-VirtualMachines.pdf).

The documentation suggests disabling time synchronization in the VMware tools properties and letting NTP inside the VM handle time synchronization.
