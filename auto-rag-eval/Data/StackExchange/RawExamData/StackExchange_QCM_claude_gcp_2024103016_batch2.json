Here's my best attempt to diagram how I have the circuit set up.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8KqH.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8KqH.png)\n\nThe Raspberry Pi will also supply both power and ground. I noticed in the Raspberry Pi 2 User Manual I got with the Pi (from Vilros) that there is a short section where it is mentioned that the Pi's GPIO pins can momentarily be set to outputs when the Pi starts up, and that if you have a circuit which connects one of the pins (as an intended input) to ground it could cause a short circuit and damage the Pi if/when the pin gets reset to an output on reboot. They recommend a 300 ohm resistor between the GPIO pin and ground pin. So I'm wondering if I can/should just put a 330 ohm resistor between the black wires (the transmitter and receiver share the same ground pin) and the ground pin to prevent a possible short circuit on startup. I was also wondering if maybe putting a diode on the white wire of the receiver would also prevent this issue. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You've misunderstood a couple of things, but i'll address the overall question first \\- **Protection of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO from over\\-current conditions**\n\nThe GPIO on the R\\-Pi can be subject to over\\-current conditions for multiple reasons, not just a start\\-up glitch where what should be a high\\-impedance (aka. resistance) input is an output instead, and could possibly be an output LOW meaning it's essentially a short\\-circuit to ground inside the R\\-PI.\n\nAs a general guideline for interfacing with ANY fancy logic/computer board like the R\\-Pi, CompactRIO, or pretty much any logic board that can have access to the outside world and doesn't already have its own ruggedized inputs/outputs (some boards do! always check datasheets/schematics to see how rugged they really are) you want to add some cheap protection yourself. \n\nTypical external protection components are simply series resistors on every single GPIO in that interacts with the outside world or external voltage sources. So in this situation, a series 330 Ohm resistor between the R\\-Pi's GPIO pin and the rest of your circuits, as a middle\\-man. \n\nThe role of the series resistor is to prevent total current into, or out of, the pin to be limited and will never be able to 'short'. \n\nThe next major protection element people use to protect logic boards like these from the outside world is ESD and over\\-voltage (like TVS diodes) clamping diode arrays. Every single pin can benefit from having an ESD clamp from the pin to ground, to absorb static discharge events \\- and TVS diodes or zeners with additional resistors to allow permanent 'over voltage' situations without ever harming the logic boards on the other side of the circuit. \n\nFor your circuit you actually won't have the dangerous short\\-circuit condition on that pin, you have already got a pull\\-up resistor to the 3\\.3V rail which acts as the current limiting element. There is no other path to ground in your simple example to worry about, except maybe the IR sensor's output if that happens to have a proper high\\-current driver output (unlikely, it's most likely to be a variable resistance). \n\nIf you wanted to be super careful, and to follow the general guidelines I ranted on about earlier, you can do something like this (and add the resistor for every other GPIO which interfaces with the real world).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ueffy.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fueffy.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nWith the 330 ohm resistor in there, the maximum input current to the GPIO pin if it was accidentally set to OUTPUT and LOW, assuming a 3\\.3V rail is connected directly to the input (but we still have the resistor there!) for whatever reason, then the maximum current will be only 10mA (3\\.3V/330R\\= 0\\.01A)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing a circuit that interfaces with a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, which of the following is the most effective general-purpose protection method to prevent over-current conditions?\n\nA) Adding a diode between the GPIO pin and ground\nB) Connecting a 330 ohm resistor between the black wires and the ground pin\nC) Placing a 330 ohm resistor in series between each GPIO pin and external circuits\nD) Using a pull-up resistor to the 3.3V rail on every GPIO pin\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that adding a series resistor (like 330 ohms) between each GPIO pin and external circuits is a general guideline for protecting any logic/computer board, including Raspberry Pi. This method limits the total current into or out of the pin, preventing short circuits and over-current conditions.\n\nOption A (adding a diode) is not the most effective general-purpose solution, as it doesn't address all potential over-current scenarios.\n\nOption B (resistor between black wires and ground) misunderstands the protection mechanism and wouldn't effectively protect the GPIO pins.\n\nOption D (pull-up resistor to 3.3V) can help in some scenarios but is not the most comprehensive protection method for all GPIO interactions.\n\nThe series resistor method (option C) is described as a typical external protection component that can benefit every single GPIO pin interacting with the outside world or external voltage sources."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/22", "source": ["https://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/16765", "https://meta.askubuntu.com", "https://meta.askubuntu.com/users/4272/"], "docs_id": 16765, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been taking some flak recently for posting duplicate/similar answers to questions that are similar, rather than noting that a duplicate answer may exist, and vtc.\n\nI've reviewed some of the 642 posts here regarding this subject, and I'm not sure that I found anything other than complex opinions. So my real question is... **Is there a written formal policy on how to handle duplicate questions/answers on Ask Ubuntu?**\n\nI have my own opinion on this subject, but I'll start by asking readers to review the comments in [unable to detect wireless after installing ubuntu 16\\.10: Broadcom bcm43212](https://askubuntu.com/questions/885031/unable-to-detect-wireless-after-installing-ubuntu-16-10-broadcom-bcm43212/885053#885053).\n\nOne might condense one answer that I've been given as... \"we don't want to clog up Ask Ubuntu with similar answers... so mark it as a dup question and reference a dup answer\".\n\nOne problem that I see with marking as a dup, and providing a link, is that **many** times the link doesn't answer the **specifics** of the **current** question. Case in point, the BCM43212\\. The dup link refered to makes **no mention** of the BCM43212, and even if you went off of the device ID (which wasn't identified in the OP), you'd get a call out to an obsolete driver quoted in 2011\\. **Wrong answer**.\n\nI'll try and keep this short...\n\nI see 6 possible answers to **any** given question...\n\n1. no answer at all\n2. a brand new answer to a brand new question\n3. a similar question marked as having a dup answer, link provided\n4. a similar question having the same/similar answer\n5. a similar question marked as dup, link provided, and having a same/similar answer\n6. wrong answer\n\nI'm not sure that considering items 2\\-5 should be considered as different. **The question got answered**.\n\nComments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your answer is addressing the specifics of the current question and is sufficiently different, then yes, it may well be better to post it. Sometimes, you can post your answer addressing the specifics *and* vote to close as a dupe. Or, which I often do, vote to close and leave a comment along the lines of \"Use the solution of the duplicate, just change `foo` to `bar`\".\n\nHowever, the flak you've been getting is because you've been posting *the exact same answer to multiple questions*. That raises an automatic moderator flag since, obviously, it is duplication of content. There have been 22 (twenty two!) separate flags raised on your answers for that! These aren't cases where you \"answer the specifics of the current question\", these are 100%, word for word identical copies of another one of your answers. \n\n9 times out of 10, when a post is flagged in such a way, the question it is answering is indeed a duplicate and should have been marked as such. Yes, sometimes the questions aren't close enough even though they have the same answer, but that is very rare. Which is why the system casts this flag to begin with. \n\nSo, if you feel that the duplicate doesn't answer the question well enough, then post a *different* answer that does address whatever detail you feel is missing. However, arguing that it shouldn't be a dupe because the specifics of the question are different, and then posting word\\-perfect identical answers doesn't make much sense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is the appropriate action when encountering a question similar to an existing one, but with specific differences?\n\nA) Always mark as duplicate and provide a link to the original question\nB) Post an identical answer to the one given for the original question\nC) Post a new answer addressing the specifics, and optionally vote to close as duplicate\nD) Ignore the question entirely\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that if your answer is addressing the specifics of the current question and is sufficiently different, it may be better to post it.

The question of licensing, however, can be addressed.\n\nTo\u00a0answer this properly, we need to look at the intellectual property holdings around both fonts \\- copyright, trademark and possibly design patent. Realize that all of this comes from my layman's understanding of IP law (that I have delved into some, but I'm still not a lawyer).\n\nAs a preface, I'm assuming that `curr.ttf` is the true type font for Courier and **not** Courier New (those tend to be named `courier new.ttf` or something to that effect \\- it is important for IP that it be named properly (if the IP holders of Courier New started naming their font file Courier instead, things become hazy)).\n\nIf, you are willing to accept wikipedia as a source of some legal information \\- from [Courier typeface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface))\n\n> Although the design of the original Courier typeface was commissioned by IBM, the company deliberately chose not to secure legal exclusivity to the typeface and it soon became a standard font used throughout the typewriter industry. Since IBM deliberately chose not to seek any copyright, trademark, or design patent protection, the Courier typeface cannot now be trademarked or copyrighted and is completely royalty free.\n\nThis information can be found in multiple locations (not just Wikipedia). One can find a more recent release of the Courier typeface at [http://www.ctan.org/tex\\-archive/fonts/psfonts/courier](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/courier) which includes the IBM/MIT X Consortium Courier Typefont agreement which reads:\n\n> You are hereby granted permission under the terms of the IBM/MIT X Consortium\n>  Courier Typefont agreement to execute, reproduce, distribute, display, market,\n>  sell and otherwise transfer copies of the IBM Courier font to third parties.\n\nThe legal bit on the 'Courier' *name* is the trademark \\- not copyright or patent (its the [trademark dilution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution) that one would be concerned with). As stated, there is deliberately no trademark protection on the Courier name (which has allowed other companies to use it as the basis for their font names \\- such as 'Courier New'. Compare with [Helvetica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) which is a registered trademark of Linotype\\-Hell, and thus when Macintosh was implementing screen fonts couldn't use that name as its basis so named the corresponding font [Geneva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_(typeface) \"Geneva is the capital of Switzerland, the Latin name for which is Helvetica\") \\- note the bitmap version of the font was not protected while the *name* Helvatica was.. and Apple likely had good lawyers for anyt that wanted to discuss that).\n\n(There is much more about this if one wants to delve into the realm of copyright law (and intellectual property) on typefaces \\- which varies by country. In the US it has been established several times that typefaces are not protected by copyright. The copyright protection declined on Courier mentioned above would have been on the wheel and hammers in the typewriter, this wasn't sought after. Design patents can also protect fonts (such as the Cocacola font) \\- this wasn't done. Furthermore, the name of the font can be protected by trademark \\- this wasn't done. Note that all of this pertains to Courier font, not others where there may be trademarks on it. The actual implementation of a font *can* be protected (the `cour.ttf` file), but one *may* be able to reimplement the font from scratch and not infringe upon copyright... though all of this gets murky if one is in the US and the font designer is in the UK (where one can copyright a typeface) \\- in which case talk to a lawyer again.)\n\nOn the other hand... 'Courier New' name from [Microsoft Typography Courier New \\- Version 5\\.10](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1735) shows a \"Courier New is a trademark of The Monotype Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.\"\n\n**You would likely be better off defining the Courier font name rather than Courier New**. 'Courier' won't raise the ire of IBM, 'Courier New' might raise the ire of The Monotype Corporation and given that this is their business, they likely do care. Defining the Courier New font family using the Courier true type font dilutes The Monotype Corporation's trademark and something that becomes an issue.\n\n**If one wants to instead license the font Courier New...**  \n\nAs has been pointed out in comments, following the link on the Microsoft Typography for licensing page takes you to [fonts.com web fonts](http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts) which has (I haven't delved into it) various licensing for the fonts for defining a font face (the lowest tier has 25k pageviews/30 days for free though you need a badge on the page \\- the next tier is $10/month and 250k pageviews/30 days with no badge on the page).

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Windows supports having many network interfaces, for example you could have both wireless and wired Ethernet on the same laptop. Each of those would be its own network adapter. It's also possible to have more than one of each type, say two Ethernet ports, which might be useful on a server.\n\nNormally you would only connect one at a time. Say you are connected to wireless, you probably would not also connect your wired interface by plugging a cable in. In this case, you would see `Media disconnected` under the `Ethernet adapter Local Area Network`, as you do see in your screenshot.\n\nIn addition to these hardware interfaces, there are also software interfaces. One common use for these type is with VPN software. These interfaces do not exist in hardware, but you can send data to them just the same, and what happens is defined by the software. A VPN would take the data and encrypt it before sending it to another interface.\n\nYour `192.168.56.1` interface is named `VirtualBox` which leads me to conclude it is a software interface set up by the `VirtualBox` software, for the purpose of creating a \"fake\" network between your \"real\" computer and the \"virtual\" computer. This means your \"real\" computer has a software interface with the address of `192.168.56.1` and the \"virtual\" computer has some other address on that \"fake\" network, probably `192.168.56.2` or something.\n\nThe FTP server ties into all this because it \"listens\" for connections on every interface you have at the same time. You have an IP address on a wireless network as `192.168.1.3` and you also have an IP address on a `VirtualBox` software network as `192.168.56.1`. The FTP server does not know/care which one is best; it just listens on both of them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Windows user notices multiple IP addresses when running the 'ipconfig' command, including 192.168.56.1, which remains visible even after shutting down their FTP server.

This is evidenced by the interface name \"VirtualBox\" mentioned in the documentation. VirtualBox creates these virtual network interfaces to facilitate communication between the host machine and virtual machines. This interface persists independently of other applications like FTP servers, which explains why it remains visible even after shutting down the FTP service.

If you don\u2019t try the balance the currents, a branch may get slightly more current than the others, which will make the LEDs in the branch slightly hotter, changing the U\\-I characteristics such that the branch will get more current, and you have thermal runaway. I think a 1\u03a9 resistor in each branch should be enough. \n\nThe pulse current is the maximum current allowed in the LED for a short time (for example if one wants to flash the led for a still picture camera). The max current should be the maximum current the LED can accept, probably with perfect thermal dissipation. I\u2019d rather not use currents much higher than the nominal current.\n\nYour calculations for resistor values and power dissipations look fine to me.\n\nEdit: it is **not** fine. First, if the maximum current in your LEDs is \\\\$4 \\\\times 90\\\\textrm{mA} \\= 360\\\\textrm{mA}\\\\$ you should certainly not design a current regulator for a higher current, or you will burn your LEDs. You should rather design it for a lower current to ensure you won\u2019t burn them. I\u2019d go for \\\\$4 \\\\times 60\\\\textrm{mA} \\= 240\\\\textrm{mA}\\\\$. Then, you\u2019d get \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{0\\.7\\\\textrm{V}}{0\\.24\\\\textrm{A}} \\= 2\\.9\\\\Omega\\\\$, with \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\times \\\\textrm{R6}}{\\\\textrm{R5} \\+ \\\\textrm{R6}}\\\\$. If you choose \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\= \\\\textrm{R6}\\\\$ (which is sane), you have \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R5}}{2} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R6}}{2}\\\\$, hence \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\= \\\\textrm{R6} \\= 5\\.8\\\\Omega\\\\$.\n\nYour circuit is more a current limiter than a current regulator. It works because when current gets (too) high, the Vbe of `T1` gets high, and then `T1` will reduce the Vgs voltage of `Q1`, which become more resistive and will reduce the current. `R7` is useful so that `T1` can reduce the voltage. Without it, you might just burn `T1` if `WHITE_GPIO` was connected to a low\\-impedence voltage source.\n\nI have no idea about the use of `R21`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the LED driver circuit described, what is the primary purpose of resistors R5 and R6?\n\nA) To limit the current through the LEDs directly\nB) To set the base current for transistor T1\nC) To determine the gate voltage of MOSFET Q1\nD) To establish the current through the MOSFET and LEDs indirectly\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The resistors R5 and R6 play a crucial role in establishing the current through the MOSFET (Q1) and consequently through the LED string. They do this indirectly by setting up a voltage drop across them that determines when transistor T1 begins to conduct. As the current increases, the voltage across R5 and R6 increases, eventually turning on T1, which then reduces the gate voltage on Q1, limiting the current. This forms a feedback loop that regulates the current through the LEDs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because R5 and R6 don't directly limit the LED current - they're part of the control circuit.\nOption B is partially true but not their primary purpose - while they do affect T1's base current, this is a consequence of their main function.\nOption C is incorrect because they don't directly set Q1's gate voltage - this is controlled by the interaction between T1 and Q1.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the current regulation mechanism in the circuit and the specific roles of key components."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/28", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/181647", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/28951/"], "docs_id": 181647, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to run a program 100 times, a few hours each, which is fine when running it in a serial way, just takes very long, but when I try to parallelize it using GNU parallel or simple '\\&' in bash, it hangs/freezes, i suspect a deadlock, but I have not written the program so cannot debug it. \n\nI guess there is little chance, but is there a way perhaps an easy way to run an application in some sort of isolation or quarantaine from everything else on linux?

So instead the terminal\\-level scrolling is disabled in this mode, and all scrolling/paging is done custom by 'less'.\n\n(In a sense, this is the *whole point* of using an in\\-terminal pager, instead of just dumping the whole text to terminal and scrolling it at terminal level. By doing scrolling internally, 'less' can start at the top of the file and let you scroll *down,* instead of always ending up at the bottom.)\n\nYour main problem is that the 'less' pager simply doesn't have mouse support. (Terminal programs *can* request to directly receive mouse input1 \u2013 e.g. you will find native mouse scroll\\-wheel support in Vim or Elinks or WeeChat \u2013 but the 'less' pager does not do this.)\n\nOn a full Ubuntu environment, when you're somehow able to scroll with the wheel inside 'less', that's actually the terminal translating wheel events to fake Up/Down arrow keypresses \u2013 GNOME Terminal always does this when the alternate\\-screen mode is active, if the app hasn't activated direct mouse input.\n\n(As a practical example, if you manually ask the terminal to switch to altscreen mode with `tput smcup`, and if you're using GNOME Terminal, then the mouse wheel will begin scrolling through your shell history. `tput rmcup` gets you back.)\n\nSo the secondary problem is that Windows Terminal doesn't provide wheel event emulation, either. It *does* support sending real wheel events to mouse\\-supporting programs (again, you can wheel\\-scroll in Vim while using Windows Terminal), but wheel\\-to\\-arrows is mostly unique to GNOME Terminal and other vte\\-based terminals.\n\nYour options are:\n\n* Open a feature request at <https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/> for the scroll emulation feature (if there isn't one already).\n* Use a pager with native mouse\\-event support (e.g. `PAGER=elinks` or `vimpager` to use Vim as a pager).\n* Use GNOME Terminal (or another vte\\-based terminal) through WSLg or X11 instead of Windows Terminal.\n* Don't use a pager at all, relying on the terminal's scrollback.\n\n---\n\n1 However, due to the way terminal APIs work in Windows, SSH is not 100% transparent (e.g. ssh.exe has to deliberately request \"Unix\\-like terminal\" mode rather than legacy \"WinNT console\" mode), and importantly here, older versions of OpenSSH for Windows (7\\.4p1, I think) were [unable to](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1158) relay *any* mouse events to the remote side. This has since been fixed \u2013 if you're at least on Windows 20H2 and have OpenSSH 8\\.1p1 or newer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between terminal scrollback and full-screen programs like 'less', and why mouse wheel scrolling may not work in 'less' on Windows Terminal?\n\nA) Full-screen programs disable terminal scrollback and implement their own scrolling mechanism, while 'less' lacks native mouse support. Windows Terminal doesn't emulate wheel events as arrow key presses.\n\nB) Terminal scrollback is always available in full-screen programs, but 'less' chooses not to use it. Windows Terminal has a bug that prevents mouse wheel scrolling in all pagers.\n\nC) 'Less' and other full-screen programs enhance terminal scrollback capabilities. Mouse wheel scrolling doesn't work in Windows Terminal due to SSH limitations.\n\nD) Full-screen programs and terminal scrollback are completely independent. The lack of mouse wheel scrolling in 'less' on Windows Terminal is due to a limitation in the 'less' program itself.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because it accurately summarizes key points from the documentation. Full-screen programs like 'less' disable the terminal's built-in scrollback by using the alternate screen mode, allowing them to implement their own scrolling mechanism. This is why 'less' starts at the top of a file and lets you scroll down, rather than ending at the bottom.\n\nThe 'less' pager doesn't have native mouse support, which is the main reason for the scrolling issue. Some terminals, like GNOME Terminal, translate mouse wheel events into arrow key presses when in alternate screen mode, but Windows Terminal doesn't provide this wheel event emulation.

I called Apple and the rep said that if power cycling the phone and \"forgetting\" the wifi network didn't help, the Apple database would clear stale entries after 30 to 60 days. Sure enough, after about a month my phone started showing the new location.\n\n(Note: I tried @bmike's procedure several times on each of the iPhones in our household, but it didn't seem to make a difference. It could be that the procedure does remove *that* phone's historical location info from Apple's database, but over the many years we were living at our old address we had enough guests with iPhones that removing only our own phones' records wasn't sufficient. If anyone else is having this problem you might as well try that procedure, but know that the problem will self\\-resolve within a month or so.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing frequent kernel panics on their MacBook Pro.

This allows Apple's database to clear stale entries automatically. The user confirmed that after about a month, their device started showing the new location correctly. While other troubleshooting steps like power cycling and \"forgetting\" Wi-Fi networks were suggested, waiting for the database to update itself proved to be the most reliable solution.

It defines a class in $H^n(U,\\\\mathbb{C})\\=\\\\mathbb{H}^n(X,\\\\Omega\\_X^\\\\bullet(\\\\log D))$.\n\nThe form $\\\\omega$ extends to a meromorphic form on $X$, denote it by $\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}$.

The example given in the StackExchange answer provides a counterexample to options A and D: for an elliptic curve X with a point p as the divisor D, there exists a form with a double pole at p whose restriction to U is not cohomologous to the restriction of any logarithmic form. This disproves A and D.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Hodge decomposition for non-compact varieties like U is not generally canonical.\n\nOption B is correct because if \u03c9\u0303 has poles of order higher than 1 along D, it cannot be a logarithmic form, and as demonstrated in the elliptic curve example, its restriction to U may not be cohomologous to any logarithmic form's restriction."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/06", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/333000", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/115844/"], "docs_id": 333000, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a new user of TeX.

The textbook says to discard the $dm\\_g dv$ term, so we have \n\n$$m\\\\,dv \\= \\- u\\\\,dm \\\\tag{2}$$\n\nTaking $m$ as a a function of time, we can then solve for $\\\\Delta v$:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\int\\_{v\\_0}^{v\\_1} dv \\&\\= \\-u \\\\int\\_{m\\_0}^{m\\_1} \\\\frac{dm}{m} \\\\\\\\\nv\\_1 \\- v\\_0 \\= \\\\Delta v \\&\\= u \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\_0}{m\\_1}\\\\right)\n\\\\end{align}$$\n\nwhere $m\\_1$ is the final mass of the rocket after expelling $\\-\\\\Delta m$ units of fuel.\n\n**My question** has to do with the connection between (1\\) and (2\\). On the left side of (2\\), we have $m\\\\, dv$, which derives from the expression $(m\\-dm\\_g)(v\\+dv)$ in (1\\). In this expression, $m$ represents the *initial* mass of the rocket\\-fuel system (hence we subtract $dm\\_g$ to get the instantaneous mass). Likewise, in (2\\) it seems to me like $m$ should refer to the rocket's initial mass $m\\_0$, not its changing mass as a function of time. \n\nThen (2\\) instead reads\n\n$$m\\_0\\\\,dv \\= \\- u\\\\,dm \\\\tag{2}$$\n\nand simply\n\n$$\\\\Delta v \\= \\-u \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\_1 \\- m\\_0}{m\\_0}\\\\right)$$\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nI'd prefer answers that clarify the proof in question, rather than providing alternative proofs from Newton's law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since your main confusion is around mass as a function of time, let's explicitly add the label of time from the beginning to be clear as to what we are talking about explicitly. \n\nYou have $p\\_i\\=p\\_f$. What this really refers to is $p\\_t\\=p\\_{t\\+dt}$. Carrying these labels of time, let's redo the calculation that your textbook does. \n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\nm\\_tv\\_t\\&\\={(m\\_t\\-dm\\_{g,t})}{(v\\_t\\+dv\\_t)}\\+dm\\_{g,t}(v\\_t\\-u)\\\\tag{1}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}$$\nNotice that I have eliminated any and all use of $t\\+dt$ from the labeling and expressed everything with a label of $t$. This is justified and necessary: The $dm\\_g$ is the mass ejected at time $t$ which causes the mass of the rocket at time $t\\+dt$ to be $m\\_{t\\+dt}\\=m\\_t\\-dm\\_{g,t}$. Similarly, the increase in speed $dv$ is at time $t$, leading to the new speed $v\\_{t\\+dt}\\=v\\_t\\+dv\\_t$. \n\nGranted, talking about \"increase at time $t$\" is a loose way of speaking, but if I want to be properly rigorous, I'd need to start talking in terms of time\\-derivatives and this would amount to simply using Newton's law which you have forbidden me from doing :) But I hope the intuitive meaning of my labeling makes sense. \n\nLet's carry out the rest of the calculation in this labeling. However, we don't really need to do that explicitly because all the symbols have the same label $t$ and so we can just add this label to the end result which we know from the calculation in your textbook. You can explicitly perform the calculations with the labels starting from Equation $\\\\text{(1\\)}$ and confirm that it leads to  \n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\nm\\_t\\\\,dv\\_t \\&\\=dm\\_{g,t}\\\\,dv\\_t\\+dm\\_{g,t}\\\\,u\\\\\\\\\n\\\\implies m\\_t\\\\,dv\\_t\\&\\=\\-dm\\_t\\\\,u \\\\tag{2}\n\\\\end{align}$$\nHere, it is explicitly clear that $m\\_t$ *is* the mass at time $t$. But let's understand this better. The answer doesn't lie in the trick I did with the $t$ labels, that just magnifies the point but doesn't create it. The point is that when you write $m\\\\,dv\\=\\-dm\\\\,u$, you're right that $m$ doesn't represent the final mass, it represents the initial mass, but that's not an issue, in fact, it is desired. You have to see this relation as an equation for $dm$ and $dv$. In other words, it tells you that if you start with a mass $m$ then the differential change in the mass and the differential change in the velocity are related by the formula $m\\\\,dv\\=\\-dm\\\\,u$ where $m$ *is* the mass *before* the differential change. Now, you again start with the mass $m\\+dm$ and do the same process, ad infinitum. Or, you can do the integration. \n\n---\n\n**A Comment Regarding OP's Answer**\n\nThe term $dm\\_g\\\\,dv$ has to be ignored because it is a second\\-order differential term. Furthermore, if you keep the term then what you obtain is actually $$m\\_{t\\+dt}dv\\_t\\=\\-dm\\_tu$$which cannot be straightforwardly integrated because of the fact that all terms don't represent quantities at the same time $t$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the rocket equation discussion:\n\nQuestion: In deriving the rocket equation, why is the term dm_g dv discarded?\n\nA) It represents a negligible force compared to the rocket's thrust\nB) It is a second-order differential term and therefore too small to be significant\nC) Keeping it would lead to an equation that can't be straightforwardly integrated\nD) It violates the principle of conservation of momentum\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The term dm_g dv is discarded because it is a second-order differential term. In the derivation of the rocket equation, we are working with first-order approximations. Second-order terms are typically much smaller than first-order terms and can be neglected without significantly affecting the result. \n\nWhile option C touches on a true consequence of keeping the term, it's not the primary reason for discarding it. Option A is incorrect because the term's significance isn't related to comparing forces. Option D is false as discarding this term doesn't violate any physical principles.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the mathematical approach in deriving the rocket equation, particularly the treatment of differential terms and approximations."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/30", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/203119", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/89677/"], "docs_id": 203119, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1\\) If the word police is plural, then we have such a sentence\n\n> Police are here\n\nOkay, no questions, but what to do with the tag question?\n\n> Police are here, aren't it?\n\nor\n\n> Police are here, aren't they?\n\nBecause I think it wouldn't be\n\n> Police are here, aren't police?\n\nWe should change it for some pronoun\n\n---\n\n2\\) We can have some dialogue:\n\n> A: Do police work well? \n> \n> \n> B: Yes, it works very well\n\nOR\n\n> A: Do police work well?\n> \n> \n> B: Yes, it work very well\n\nOR\n\n> A: Do police work well?\n> \n> \n> B: Yes, they work very well\n\nActually it's the same point number 1, but anyway\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *The police* are a group of *people*, and that overrides the idea of them being an *entity*, so you have to use *a pronoun that can be applied to people* \\- you want ***they***."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sentences correctly uses a tag question and pronoun when referring to \"police\" as a plural noun?\n\nA) Police are here, aren't it?\nB) Police are here, isn't they?\nC) Police are here, aren't they?\nD) Police are here, aren't police?\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nWhen using \"police\" as a plural noun, it should be treated as a group of people rather than a single entity.

For instance, if x is non-zero but y = 0, they satisfy the condition but are not linearly dependent.\n\nThis question tests understanding of complex vector spaces, inner products, and the subtle implications of the given equality."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/03", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/152838", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/31354/"], "docs_id": 152838, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to find jquery code and execute order processing when click on place order in checkout page beacuse i logged in and when I select shipping address and switch to payment step and unchecked of same as shipping address in billing and add new billing address and when I click place order button it automatically checked checkobx of 'My billing address as shipping address'.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These two files.\n\nPATH: \n\n> html/vendor/magento/module\\-checkout/view/frontend/web/js/action/place\\-order.js:12\n\n.\n\n> html/vendor/magento/module\\-checkout/view/frontend/web/js/view/review/actions/default.js:17"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento 2 checkout process, which combination of files is most likely responsible for handling the place order action and managing the review section of the checkout?\n\nA) place-order.js in the module-checkout directory and actions-default.js in the module-sales directory\nB) place-order.js and review-actions-default.js, both in the module-checkout directory\nC) order-placement.js in the module-sales directory and checkout-review.js in the module-checkout directory\nD) place-order.js in the module-checkout directory and review-actions.js in the module-sales directory\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation specifically mentions two files that are crucial for the checkout process:\n\n1. place-order.js located at html/vendor/magento/module-checkout/view/frontend/web/js/action/place-order.js\n2. default.js (which is part of the review actions) located at html/vendor/magento/module-checkout/view/frontend/web/js/view/review/actions/default.js\n\nBoth of these files are within the module-checkout directory, which aligns with option B.

Every processing step independent from the other ones and consoists of a small amount of code, 5\\-15 lines in general. These are mostly wrappers to JAI, AWT and so on.\n\nMy current design is an abstract class:\n\n```\npublic abstract class AbstractPreProcessingStep {\n    protected Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName());\n\n    protected AbstractPreProcessingStep() {\n    };\n\n    public abstract BufferedImage startProcessing(BufferedImage input);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nEvery processing step implements this class and can be called uniform. (like the Strategy\\-Pattern).\n\nSince every processing step may have a different set of parameters, I created a factory class, like this:\n\n```\npublic class PreProcessingFactory {\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createColorInverter() {\n        return new ColorInverter();\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createRescaler(float rescaleFactor) {\n        return new Rescaler(rescaleFactor);\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createEdgeDetector() {\n        return new EdgeDetector();\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createBlackAndWhite() {\n        return new BlackAndWhite();\n    }\n...\n\n```\n\nSo, if you want to create a black and white image with inverted colors, you need to do this (pseude code)\n\n```\nbw = PreProcessingFactory.createBlackAndWhite();\ninv = PreProcessingFactory.createInverter();\nresult = bw.startProcessing(result);\nresult = inv.startProcessing(result);\n\n```\n\nIn my mind, this is a good design since the implementation details are hidden and new processing steps can easily be add by adding a new class.\n\nThe other approach which was in my mind was to create a single class with every step as a static method \\- however, I've got dislike of 'static'\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll make the following assumptions about your process:\n\n1. One step does not need to know about the inner workings of another step.\n2. Order of these steps is significant (you don't obtain the same results performing these operations in the opposite order).\n\nIn this situation, I can only really tell you what I would do. I would avoid Factory pattern, simply because it implies you must have a factory method for every type of phase, and if you wanted to invent new stages, you'd also have to modify the factory as well. Plus while it may be manageable in bite\\-sized pieces, if you had to deal with 50 phases, even if it didn't change often, it would still be very messy. Not to mention that factory would seem to imply that order is irrelevant. It makes you think that you can make any number of `AbstractPreProcessingStep`s and apply them in however order you wish. Even if that is not the case, I think it is generally better to present an interface which does not mislead a programmer.\n\nConsider the following alternative pattern: [Chain of responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern)\n\nSuppose you had class AbstractProcessor as such:\n\n```\npublic abstract class AbstractProcessor {\n    protected AbstractProcessor step;\n\n    public void setNextStep(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        this.step = step;\n    }\n\n    public abstract BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input);\n}\n\n```\n\nThen you could have your steps as such:\n\n```\npublic class ColorInverter extends AbstractProcessor {\n    public ColorInverter(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        setNextStep(step);\n    }\n\n    public BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input) {\n        // Perform color inverter process here\n        return step != null ? step.process(output) : output;\n    }\n}\npublic class Rescaler extends AbstractProcessor {\n    public Rescaler(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        setNextStep(step);\n    }\n\n    public BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input) {\n        // Perform rescalar process here\n        return step != null ? step.process(output) : output;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nJust like this, it is beautiful in its simplicity, however, you could override ordering for steps which must be performed at the end simply by calling \"`step.process(input)`\" and performing some operation on the returned result. \n\nAlso, if there were specific phases, you could override `AbstractProcessor`'s `setNextStep` to require a certain type of `AbstractProcessor` to guarantee that certain phases are achieved. Take for example the following:\n\n```\npublic abstract class RasteringProcessingStep extends AbstractProcessor { \n    public void setNextStep(RasteringProcessingStep step) {\n        super.setNextStep(step);\n    }\n    public void setNextStep(PostProcessingStep step) {\n        super.setNextStep(step);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this way, you ensure that any step implementing `RasteringProcessingStep` must either be followed by another `RasteringProcessingStep` or it must be followed by a `PostProcessingStep` which also derives from `AbstractPreProcessingStep`.\n\nTo use it, you would see something like:\n\n```\nAbstractProcessor processor = new ColorInverter(new Rescaler(null));\nFile image = new File(\"strawberry.jpg\");\nBufferedImage output = processor.process(ImageIO.read(image));\n\n```\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this approach."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of image processing operations, which design pattern is being implemented in the following code snippet, and what is its primary advantage?\n\n```java\npublic abstract class AbstractProcessor {\n    protected AbstractProcessor step;\n\n    public void setNextStep(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        this.step = step;\n    }\n\n    public abstract BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input);\n}\n\npublic class ColorInverter extends AbstractProcessor {\n    public ColorInverter(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        setNextStep(step);\n    }\n\n    public BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input) {\n        // Perform color inverter process here\n        return step != null ? step.process(output) : output;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA) Factory Pattern - It allows for easy creation of different processing steps\nB) Strategy Pattern - It enables swapping algorithms at runtime\nC) Chain of Responsibility Pattern - It allows for a sequence of processing steps to be defined dynamically\nD) Decorator Pattern - It adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The code implements the Chain of Responsibility Pattern. This pattern allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers, with each handler deciding either to process the request or to pass it along the chain.\n\nThe primary advantage of this pattern in this context is that it allows for a sequence of image processing steps to be defined dynamically. Each processing step (like ColorInverter) can be linked to the next step, creating a chain. This approach is flexible, as new processing steps can be easily added or removed from the chain without modifying existing code.\n\nThe AbstractProcessor class defines the structure for the chain, with each concrete processor (like ColorInverter) implementing the process method and potentially passing the result to the next step in the chain. This design allows for easy composition of different processing steps in various orders, which is particularly useful for image processing where the order of operations can significantly affect the final result."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/03", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/71983", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/1459/"], "docs_id": 71983, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have just read [the following question about measurable and non\\-measurable sets](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/71976/lebesgue-non-measurability-in-the-plane).

I think however a bigger problem is the ratio itself. What I mean is $1/2$ is not at all the same with $50/100$. The ratio is the same, however, if you think about how confidence you have in each observation is not. $50$ observations from $100$ trials is much more evidence than $1$ observation from $2$ trials, even if the expected value is the same.

As described in Cap \\& Slovak 1\\.5\\.17, on a Cartan geometry $(\\\\mathcal{P} \\\\to M, \\\\omega)$ modelled on $G/P$, we have a \"Cartan space\" which is an associated bundle $S :\\=\\\\mathcal{P} \\\\times^P G/P \\\\to M$ that comes equipped with a canonical section $O: x \\\\mapsto \\[u, eP]$ as well as a connection induced by the Cartan connection. Then there is a development map which takes germs of curves in the base $M$ to germs of curves in the model $G/P$ (technically the fibre of the Cartan space until we pick a frame in the $\\\\mathcal{P}$). Explicitly, for a (germ of a) curve $c$ in $M$ with $c(0\\)\\=x$, we get (a germ of a) curve $\\\\mathrm{dev}\\_c$ in the fibre $S\\_x$ of the Cartan space given by $$\\\\mathrm{dev}\\_c(t) :\\= \\\\mathrm{Pt}\\_{c\\_t}((O(c(t)),\\-t)$$\nwhere $c\\_t(s) :\\= c(t\\+s)$.

Even if it's 150 feet long, it will still be capable of about 770 watts safely, and you're describing a total of something around 200 watts.

The circuit is on a 15-amp breaker. What is the maximum wattage light fixture that can be safely added to this circuit, assuming no other loads and using a 16-gauge extension cord?\n\nA) 100W\nB) 250W\nC) 500W\nD) 1000W\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe question tests understanding of electrical load calculations and circuit capacity. \n\nA 15-amp circuit at 120V can safely handle up to 1800W (15A * 120V = 1800W). The two heaters consume 140W total (60W + 80W). \n\nThe 16-gauge cord is rated for about 770W over long distances, which is well above the total load described.\n\nTherefore, the remaining capacity for the light fixture is 1800W - 140W = 1660W. \n\nThe correct answer is D (1000W), as it's the largest option that stays within the circuit's capacity. Options A, B, and C are also technically correct but underutilize the available power. In practice, a 1000W outdoor light would be unusually large, but it's theoretically possible within the circuit's limits.\n\nThis question challenges students to consider circuit capacity, voltage, amperage, and how to calculate remaining capacity for additional loads."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/28", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/19595", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/10278/"], "docs_id": 19595, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'd previously used aufs2 in aufs\\-tools with some luck, but apparently this package has been \"superseded\" (this is strange term to use for a package which seems to have been removed only because it no longer compiles, but never mind).\n\nOkay, so I thought I would try to use unionfs\\-fuse.

After symmetry breaking there is no residual symmetry and hence there are $(2^2\\-1\\)\\=3$ goldstone bosons. The same Lagrangian can also be written as $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\phi\\_i)^2\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}\\\\phi\\_i^2\\)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}\\\\phi\\_i^2\\)^2$$ which is nothing but the Lagrangian of linear sigma model. After symmetry breaking the symmetry of the Lagrangian reduces from $O(4\\)$ to $O(3\\)$. Therefore, there are $3$ goldstone bosons once again and the results match. However, I'm having a confusion with the following. Consider the theory $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\xi^\\\\dagger)(\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\xi)\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\xi^\\\\dagger\\\\xi)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\xi^\\\\dagger\\\\xi)^2$$ where $\\\\xi\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\xi\\_1\\+i\\\\xi\\_2\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi\\_3\\+i\\\\xi\\_4\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi\\_0\\+i\\\\xi\\_5\\\\end{pmatrix}$ is a complex $SU(2\\)$ triplet.

So it doesn't match. Then where am I making the mistake? What is the correct number of Goldstone bosons in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your first two theories, *\u03a6* in the spinor rep of SU(2\\), and *\u03c6* in the vector rep of O(4\\), are dealt with correctly, with 3 generators broken in both cases, so 3 goldstons and one massive field. \n\nYou have completely messed up the counting and symmetry structure of your latter theory. The first form, with a complex triplet *\u03be*, is SU(3\\)\\-, not just SU(2\\), invariant, and this SU(3\\) breaks down to the residual SU(2\\) by the v.e.v., so 8\\-3\\=5 broken generators, and thus 5 goldstons, and one residual massive field, just as in the language of your O(4\\)/O(3\\) vector representation model. \n\nI am unclear as to how you concluded, erroneously, that \"there is no residual SU(2\\)\". There is: it mixes up the components not involving the v.e.v. So, for example, if the v.e.v. is dialed to the 3rd component, the SU(2\\) subgroup mixing up the upper two components ($\\\\lambda\\_1, \\\\lambda\\_2,\\\\lambda\\_3$ Gell\\-Mann matrices) is unbroken.

Keep an eye on this value and, if it is increasing, replace the disk."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is analyzing the SMART data of a Western Digital RE4 3TB hard drive. Which of the following observations from the SMART log is most concerning and requires immediate attention?\n\nA) The LifeTime(hours) in the self-test log appears to be out of order, with more recent tests showing higher hours than older tests.\n\nB) The Power_On_Hours attribute (#9) shows a value of 5476 hours, indicating the drive has been in use for about 7.5 months.\n\nC) The Multi_Zone_Error_Rate attribute (#200) has a non-zero RAW_VALUE of 1, suggesting a potential sector write issue.\n\nD) The Extended offline self-test #9 was interrupted by a host reset at 90% completion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While the out-of-order LifeTime(hours) in the self-test log is unusual, it's not necessarily a sign of imminent drive failure and could be due to a quirk in older drives.\n\nB) The Power_On_Hours value is normal for a drive that has been in use for several months and doesn't indicate any problem by itself.\n\nC) This is the most concerning observation. A non-zero Multi_Zone_Error_Rate suggests that the drive has experienced at least one bad or unsuccessful sector write. This could be an early indicator of drive degradation and should be monitored closely. If this value increases over time, it may indicate a need to replace the drive.\n\nD) While an interrupted self-test is not ideal, a single occurrence doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, especially if subsequent tests completed successfully.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it points to a potential hardware issue that could worsen over time, potentially leading to data loss or drive failure."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/13", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/492915", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/249125/"], "docs_id": 492915, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I connect a cell with 100 \u03a9 resistor. voltage across circuit is 1\\.4 V and current is 14 mA.
