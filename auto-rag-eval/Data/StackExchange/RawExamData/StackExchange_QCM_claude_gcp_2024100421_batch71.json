The first is to note that `EEMEM` just pre\\-allocates variables into the EEPROM memory space, and you can just as easily use the actual memory addresses in the various `eeprom_` api functions. So you could create a table of `#define` constants for the variables you require and access them this way. The only real disadvantage is that you need to keep track of how each variable is allocated, but as soon as you require fixed allocations then you'll have to do this anyway.\n\nIf you only require part of the memory to have fixed allocation and the rest you want the compiler to sort out, you can create a new linker section, for example, called `.eepromfixed`. You could allocate say the first 256 bytes of EEPROM to this section and use it for manually allocated variables (as described above), and then use the regular EEPROM section for anything else."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with EEPROM memory in embedded systems, which of the following approaches allows for both fixed allocation of specific variables and compiler-managed allocation of the remaining space?\n\nA) Using only the EEMEM attribute for all variables\nB) Manually defining memory addresses for all EEPROM variables\nC) Creating a new linker section (e.g. .eepromfixed) for fixed allocations and using the regular EEPROM section for the rest\nD) Using only eeprom_ API functions without any memory allocation strategy\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because using only EEMEM doesn't allow for fixed allocation of specific variables. \nOption B is possible but doesn't allow for compiler-managed allocation of the remaining space. \nOption C is correct as it provides a balance between manual control and compiler management. It allows you to create a new linker section (like .eepromfixed) for variables that need fixed allocation, while still using the regular EEPROM section for compiler-managed allocations.\nOption D doesn't address the allocation strategy at all and is therefore incorrect."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/12/26", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/87765", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/19203/"], "docs_id": 87765, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: lately I have been working a lot on my desktop computer, 3 months, leaving behind my laptop.

In practice, this is usually not an issue as reference voltage circuits with enough ripple rejection can be made.\n\nAn opamp (used as an error amplifier) compares the output voltage (actually a divided\\-down version of the output voltage, \\\\$R\\_1\\\\$ and \\\\$R\\_2\\\\$ are a voltage divider).\n\nThe output of the opamp controls a transistor, Q2\\.\n\nIf the **opamp** is fast enough then it can control the transistor Q2 so well that it will be fast enough to respond to the voltage changes (ripple!) at \\\\$V\\_i\\\\$. It will respond in such a way that at \\\\$V\\_o\\\\$ there's as little left of the ripple as the loop can manage. In essence, the loop **compensates** for the ripple by controlling Q2 such that the ripple is **rejected**.\n\nIf you would do the proper loop analysis you would find that the ripple rejection depends on the **excess loop gain** inside the loop. For more information, [read this](https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/loop-gain-and-its-effect-on-analog-control-systems.html).\n\nSo with an opamp that is both fast enough and that has a high gain (for 120 Hz, that is not an issue, the gain will be quite high) we can achieve quite high ripple rejection.\n\nAt (much) higher frequencies that 120 Hz, like for example at 1 MHz, the opamp will not be fast enough and will have less gain meaning less ripple rejection. Fortunately we can then use capacitors to help us out. For 1 MHz these capacitors can have a relatively small value (a few uF) so size and cost is less of an issue. Also these capacitors are often needed to guarantee **stability** of the voltage regulator, without the input and output capacitors the voltage regulator might **oscillate** and generate a new ripple!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A voltage regulator IC like the LM7805 achieves high ripple rejection (73 dB typical at 120 Hz) primarily through which mechanism?\n\nA) Using large internal filter capacitors\nB) Employing a high-speed feedback loop with an error amplifier\nC) Relying on the bandgap reference circuit alone\nD) Utilizing multiple stages of LC filters internally\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The LM7805 and similar voltage regulators achieve high ripple rejection primarily through a feedback loop system. This system consists of:\n\n1. A stable reference voltage (often from a bandgap circuit)\n2. An error amplifier (typically an op-amp) that compares the output to the reference\n3.

This active compensation is far more effective at low frequencies like 120 Hz than passive filtering alone.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the IC doesn't rely on large internal capacitors for ripple rejection. \nOption C is wrong because while the bandgap reference is important, it's not the primary mechanism for ripple rejection. \nOption D is incorrect as the IC doesn't use multiple LC filter stages internally.\n\nThe high-speed feedback loop (Option B) is the key to the regulator's impressive ripple rejection at low frequencies."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/17", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/107523", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/28508/"], "docs_id": 107523, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: TL;DR\n=====\n\nI can't get an installation free version of GDAL/OGR to work from within ArcMap 10\\.0\\.

Your bindings need to be compiled against ESRI's GDAL to work reliably. It's possible they can be made to work, but it is going to be a lot of headache.\n\nIn short, ESRI needs to provide the gdal\\_i.lib stub file that GDAL generates as part of its compilation process, and you need to build the Python bindings against that. I don't know that ESRI provides this, however.\n\nMaybe ESRI could be requested to provide a gdal.py and GDAL bindings as part of ArcPy? Alternatively, maybe you could use [Fiona](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona) and [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) to replicate the GDAL bindings parts you need. These have the benefit of not needing to link against the ESRI GDAL and instead are able to use it by doing C API calls directly into the DLL."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to use GDAL/OGR with ArcMap 10.0, a user encounters an ImportError. What is the most likely cause of this issue and the best solution?\n\nA) The GDAL installation is incompatible with the 32-bit version of ArcMap. Reinstall GDAL as a 64-bit version.\n\nB) The environment variables are not set correctly. Add the GDAL bin folder to the system PATH and create a GDAL_DATA variable.\n\nC) The GDAL bindings from an external source are incompatible with ArcMap's internal GDAL version. Use GDAL bindings compiled specifically for ESRI's GDAL or alternative libraries like Fiona and rasterio.\n\nD) Importing arcpy before GDAL/OGR causes conflicts. Always import GDAL/OGR modules before importing arcpy in scripts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the ImportError is that the GDAL bindings downloaded from an external source (in this case, from gohlke) are not compatible with the internal GDAL version used by ArcMap. This incompatibility leads to DLL loading failures when trying to use GDAL/OGR with ArcMap.\n\nThe best solution is to use GDAL bindings that are specifically compiled against ESRI's GDAL version. However, since these may not be readily available, an alternative approach is to use libraries like Fiona and rasterio, which can interface with ESRI's GDAL through C API calls without needing to link against it directly.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because changing the bit version or modifying environment variables alone won't resolve the core compatibility issue.

The 'multiselect' input type allows for multiple statuses, which can include \"in stock\" and \"out of stock\". The 'ArrayBackend' is suitable for handling multiple values. The 'default' => 0 ensures that the attribute has a default value, preventing null issues. Setting 'used_in_product_listing' to true ensures the attribute is considered in product listings, which is crucial for managing visibility based on stock status.

What does this scenario most likely indicate about Apple's App Store release date policy?\n\nA) Apple uses the date of the most recent update as the release date for ranking purposes.\nB) Apple maintains the original release date, regardless of updates or temporary removals.\nC) Apple resets the release date to the date when an app is re-listed after being temporarily removed.\nD) Apple randomly assigns new release dates to apps that have been temporarily removed and updated.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The scenario suggests that Apple likely uses the original release date for ranking purposes in the \"Release Date\" list, even after an app has been temporarily removed and updated. This is evidenced by the fact that the game did not regain its top position in the list after the update was approved, despite the developer's attempt to set a future release date. This policy helps maintain consistency in app rankings and prevents developers from manipulating their position in the \"Release Date\" list by temporarily removing and re-uploading their apps."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/18", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40106741", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5711967/"], "docs_id": 40106741, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the following string matrix: \n\n```\nencodedData=[1 0 1 1]\n\n```\n\nI want to create a new Matrix \"mananalog\" replacing encodedData items\\= 1's with \\[1 1 1 1] and 0's with \\[\\-1 \\-1 \\-1 \\-1]\n\nFinal matrix mananalog would be: \\[1 1 1 1 \\-1 \\-1 \\-1 \\-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n\nI've tried using the following code:\n\n```\nmananalog(find(encodedData=='0'))=[num2str(1*(-Vd)) num2str(1*(-Vd)) num2str(1*(-Vd)) num2str(1*(-Vd))];\nmananalog(find(encodedData=='1'))=[num2str(1*(Vd)) num2str(1*(Vd)) num2str(1*(Vd)) num2str(1*(Vd))];\n\n```\n\nvd\\=0\\.7\n========\n\nNevertheless, i have the following error: \n\n```\nIn an assignment  A(I) = B, the number of elements in B and I must be the same.\n\n```\n\nDo you know the function so as to do this?

Then it search for `'0'` and replaces it with the string `'-1 -1 -1 -1'`. \n\nWith integers, not characters:\n\n```\nencodedData = [1 0 1 1];\nreshape(bsxfun(@minus, 2*encodedData, ones(4,1)), 1, [])\nans =    \n   1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1\n\n```\n\nAnd, if you have MATLAB R2015a or later then there's [`repelem`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/repelem.html) as Luis mentioned in a comment:\n\n```\nrepelem(2*encodedData-1, 4)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given an encoded data array [1 0 1 1], which MATLAB function or approach would most efficiently transform it into the expanded form [1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1] without using loops?\n\nA) Use strrep() twice, first replacing '1' with '1 1 1 1' and then '0' with '-1 -1 -1 -1'\nB) Use reshape() and bsxfun() as follows: \n   reshape(bsxfun(@minus, 2*encodedData, ones(4,1)), 1, [])\nC) Use regexprep() twice, first replacing '1' with '1 1 1 1' and then '0' with '-1 -1 -1 -1'\nD) Use repelem() as follows: repelem(2*encodedData-1, 4)\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While options A, B, and C are valid approaches, option D using repelem() is the most efficient and concise solution for this problem, especially for MATLAB versions R2015a and later. The repelem() function repeats each element of the input array a specified number of times. By using 2*encodedData-1, we convert 0 to -1 and 1 to 1, then repeat each element 4 times.

How to compute it?\n\n**Motivation:** McKean, in page 242 of his article \"Selberg's Trace Formula as Applied to a Compact Riemann Surface\" states the formal power series expansion:\n$$\\\\frac{e^{\\-\\\\frac{t}{4}}}{(4\\\\pi t)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}} \\\\int\\_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x e^{\\-\\\\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\\\\sinh(\\\\frac{x}{2})}dx \\= \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi t} \\\\left(1 \\-\\\\frac{t}{3} \\+ O(t^2\\) \\\\right).$$\n\nHe gives no proof for it, so I decided to do my homework and compute it. My approach consisted in defining: \n$$f(t):\\= \\\\frac{e^{\\-\\\\frac{t}{4}}}{(4\\\\pi t)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\int\\_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x e^{\\-\\\\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\\\\sinh(\\\\frac{x}{2})}dx.$$\n\nThen in computing its Taylor expansion in $t\\=0$. The first term of the Taylor expansion follows easily (see below in \"My progresses\"). To compute the second term of the expansion I need:\n\n$$ \\\\partial\\_t(f(t))\\_{t\\=0} \\= \\\\lim\\_{t \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\partial\\_t(f(t))\\= \\\\lim\\_{t\\\\rightarrow 0 } \\-\\\\frac{f(t)}{4} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\cdot\\\\{\\\\text{Limit above}\\\\}.$$\n\nThis is why I'm interested in the limit above. The conjectured result follows by McKean statement and $\\\\underset{t \\\\rightarrow 0}{\\\\lim} f(t) \\=1$.\n\n**My progresses:** A useful partial result I have got is the limit, for $n$ odd:\n$$\\\\lim\\_{t\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\: \\\\frac{1}{t^{\\\\frac{n}{2}}} \\\\int\\_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^n e^{\\-\\\\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\\\\sinh(\\\\frac{x}{2})}dx\\=\\\\left(\\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\frac{n\\-1}{2}}\\\\frac{2i\\-1}{2}\\\\right)2^n \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}.$$\n\nWhich I use to compute the first term of the Taylor expansion. Applying it to the \"main\" limit we see that it is of the form $\\\\frac{0}{0}$. But applying L'Hopital rule we erase the $\\\\frac{1}{t}$ from the denominator just to get it again from the derivative of the numerator, and we come back to the $\\\\frac{0}{0}$ situation. I iterated the rule for some steps but it doesn't seem to bring anywhere.\n\n**Remark:** I'm actually interested in the expansion as in McKean, so if you have any way to compute it avoiding the limit above for me it would be a completely satisfying answer.

As a first step, one can switch to a problem that is somewhat easier, namely that of computing the cohomology of the *homotopy quotient*, $X \\\\times\\_G EG$. Here $EG$ is a contractible space with a free action of $G$. The idea here is that $X \\\\times EG$ is $G$\\-equivariantly homotopy equivalent to $X$ and now the action is free. When $X$ is a point then the homotopy quotient is just $EG/G \\= BG$.\n\nThe cohomology of $X \\\\times\\_G EG$ is what is known as the (Borel) equivariant cohomology of $X$, written $H\\_G^\\*(X)$. This is now a nice cohomology theory satisfying appropriate axioms. An important feature of it is that it is a module over the ring $H\\_G^\\*(pt) \\= H^\\*(BG)$.\n\nIf the group $G$ is a torus then there are some quite powerful tools for computing equivariant cohomology in terms of things like the set of nonfree orbits. A beautiful place to start is the paper of Aityah and Bott, *The moment map and equivariant cohomology*. Topology 23 (1984\\), no. 1, 1\\-28\\.\n\nOne of the theorems you will find explained in there is that the inclusion of the subspace of non\\-free orbits $S$ into $X$ becomes an isomorphism on equivariant cohomology once you localize (in the ring\\-theoretic sense) by inverting the equivariant Euler classes of the normal bundles of the components of $S$. Fortunately, the map from equivariant cohomology to the localized equivariant cohomology is usually injective so doing this doesn't lose any information.\n\nFinally, there is a map from $X \\\\times\\_G EG \\\\to X/G$ given by collapsing $EG$ down to a point.

Computing the cohomology of Q/G for a non-free action is generally quite difficult. Instead, mathematicians often start by computing the equivariant cohomology H_G*(Q), which is defined as the cohomology of the homotopy quotient Q \u00d7_G EG. This equivariant cohomology is typically easier to work with and has nice properties, such as being a module over H*(BG).\n\nThere exists a map from Q \u00d7_G EG to Q/G that gives rise to a spectral sequence. This spectral sequence allows one to compute the cohomology of the quotient Q/G from the equivariant cohomology and additional geometric data about the action, its fixed points, and stabilizers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because standard cohomology techniques for manifolds are generally not sufficient for computing the cohomology of Q/G in the case of non-free actions.\n\nOption C is false because while the homotopy quotient Q \u00d7_G EG is related to Q/G, their cohomologies are not necessarily isomorphic.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Atiyah-Bott localization theorem is specifically powerful for torus actions, not for arbitrary compact Lie groups.

This means that the OS has put some stuff in your memory to be quicker. It calls this \"used\" (therefore your 'free' number is only 112\\), but it is actually available for you if you need it.\n\nThis is a good thing, because unused memory is useless memory. The cached memory can be cleared if needed.

This larger number represents the actual amount of memory that can be used by applications. \n\nThe 'available' memory includes both the completely free memory and the memory that is currently being used for caching but can be quickly freed if needed by applications.

The sequence will stabilize at 1. This happens for numbers like 1, 7, and 13.\n2. The sequence will enter an infinite loop that includes the number 4.

This could lead to unnecessary processing and potential performance issues.\n\nOption B, while effective for real-time updates, is overly complex for this scenario and would require significant changes to both the client and server-side code.\n\nOption C is not a standard Backbone.js method and would require custom implementation, potentially leading to inefficient polling of the server.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate solution in this context. By adding an event listener to the collection, you can trigger a re-render only when new data is successfully fetched. This approach is efficient and aligns well with Backbone.js's event-driven architecture.

POST /V1/guest-carts/{cartId}/shipping-information - This sets the shipping information for the order.\n5. PUT /V1/guest-carts/{cartId}/order - This finalizes the order with the specified payment method.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes an unnecessary step to get payment information. Option C is missing the initial step to get product information and includes an unnecessary step to get cart information. Option D includes several unnecessary steps (getting cart information and payment information) which aren't required for placing the order."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/20", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/52697", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/13784/"], "docs_id": 52697, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I write a document in Latex I usually use my custom `\\todo{<my note>}`\\-command to not forget things that I will have to come back to.

It is a wholly different method of control flow, and can be used to express some complex types of control flow that are difficult to express with primitive constructs such as loops and conditionals. For example, it's the basis for [asynchrony in C\\# 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/continuation-passing-style-revisited-part-five-cps-and-asynchrony). All `await` really does, in essence, is pass a continuation.\n\nIt is certainly a valid construct, but the answer to when you should use this for *event\\-driven* programming is *never*, because it's not an event. There is no subscription of any kind; the callback is coupled to method call. You also can't have multiple subscriptions, which you *can* have with any old `event`.\n\nSo it comes down a choice between (a) using a plain `EventHandler` or (b) using a custom `MyEventHandler` with event data. And the answer to that is simple: use a custom event *if there is important, **transient** data associated with the event.*\n\nImagine if you had to query for the cursor position every time you executed a `MouseDown` event handler. It would be completely unreliable, because the mouse position could and often would change between the time the event was fired and the time it was handled. On the other hand, an `Initialized` event is pretty self\\-explanatory; it's only going to happen once in the lifetime of an object and there's really not much else to say about it other than \"OK, I'm ready!\".\n\nSo, in summary, (a) use the default `EventHandler` when you've got nothing else interesting to say, (b) use a strong\\-typed `EventHandler<T>` when you do, and (c) don't use CPS for event notifications."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is designing a system to notify users about upcoming appointments.

The apparent decrease in stress after the yield point is due to necking, which is the thinning of the material as it's strained.
