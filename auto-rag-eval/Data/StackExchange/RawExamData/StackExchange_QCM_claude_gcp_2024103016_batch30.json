I have tried to highlight hyperlinks to change their color, but the color remains the same even after selecting a color for them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As someone who's done a lot of UX (user experience) work over the years, I have to admit I was very surprised when I first saw the hyperlink colour in Apple's Notes app. Not so surprised that someone would actually propose it, but very surprised it passed through all the review processes at Apple.\n\nAnyway, I do have a couple of workaround options that *may* help you until Apple addresses this, as I fully expect they will at some point. These options are far from perfect, but if the default hyperlink colour is enough of an issue, they are worth considering.\n\n**Hyperlinks displaying the actual URL**\n\nIf your hyperlink text displays the actual URL (e.g. \"apple.stackexchange.com\" instead of \"Ask Different\") you can do this:\n\n1. Right\\-click on the yellow link\n2. From the context menu, select *Remove Link*\n\nYou will notice that the link text now changes to black\\* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double\\-click) and then right\\-clicking to select the *Open URL* option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.\n\n\\*If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with *http:* etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link. \n\n**Hyperlinks displaying words**\n\nIf your hyperlink text displays words instead of an actual URL (e.g. \"Ask Different\" instead of \"apple.stackexchange.com\") you can do this:\n\n1. Right\\-click on the yellow link\n2. From the context menu, select *Edit Link...*\n3. This will open up the Link Destination window with the full URL already selected. Copy (`command``C`) or cut (`command``X`) the link and click on the OK button.\n4. In your note, Paste (`command``V`) the URL over the original hyperlink text\n5. Right\\-click on what is still a yellow link\n6. From the context menu, select *Remove Link*\n\nOnce again you will notice that the link text now changes to black\\* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double\\-click) and then right\\-clicking to select the *Open URL* option from the context menu.

The documentation suggests removing the link, which changes the text color to black (or allows you to manually change it if it's a full URL).

Using rising_edge() on a slow, non-clock signal like a 1Hz PPS can lead to timing and metastability issues.\n\nB) While this could work, it doesn't directly address the need to sync with an external PPS signal and may drift over time.\n\nC) This is the best practice. Sampling the slow PPS signal with a fast system clock and then using edge detection logic allows for proper synchronization and avoids potential timing issues. This method also helps prevent metastability problems.\n\nD) While interrupts can be useful in some scenarios, they are typically more applicable in processor-based systems rather than pure FPGA designs. This approach doesn't address the synchronization issues as effectively as option C.\n\nThe correct approach (C) involves using the fast system clock to sample the slow PPS signal, typically using a double or triple flip-flop synchronizer, and then detecting edges on the synchronized signal.

However, it also mentions that this can be confusing because there could be another of the same Pokemon species naturally spawned nearby, which would cause it to show up on the sightings list. This makes option C the most accurate statement, as it accounts for both the general rule (lured Pokemon don't appear on sightings) and the potential exception (if there's a natural spawn of the same species nearby)."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/13", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/192786", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/61391/"], "docs_id": 192786, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It\u2019s clear that we can say **we\u2019re**, **they\u2019re**, **he\u2019s**, **she\u2019s**. However, when the subjects are not subject pronouns, can we use short forms of be? For example, can we say: \n\n> My dad\u2019s washing the car. \n>  Jane and Kate\u2019re eating. \n>  Their children\u2019re running\n\n.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on whether you want to know if we \"can\" do this in pronunciation or in writing. In pronunciation, you can use schwa for the vowel of \"are\" after a subject like \"Jane and Kate\" or \"Their children\". But in spelling, it's not necessarily a good idea to write this with an apostrophe.\n\nThe plural subject pronouns *we, you, they* end in vowels, so what is written `'re` in this context is a non\\-syllabic sound: *we're, you're* and *they're* are all single syllables. (Their exact pronunciation differs between different speakers, and depending on the rate of speech.)\n\n\"Kate\" and \"children\" end in consonants, so you can't use a non\\-syllabic \"\\-re\" after them. But you certainly can weaken the vowel of \"are\" to a schwa sound (in American English, this would be a \"rhoticized\" schwa sound, or a syllabic \"r\" sound).\n\nSome speakers are comfortable with representing this schwa sound with an apostrophe. But personally, I don't like to write contractions when I pronounce a schwa sound, so I would avoid writing \"Jane and Kate\u2019re eating\" or \"Their children\u2019re running.\" \n\nI think we see a somewhat similar situation with the contraction `'ve`. In the pronoun contractions *I've, you've, we've, they've,* it represents a non\\-syllabic consonant /v/. Some people are comfortable with also using `'ve` to represent syllabic \\[\u0259v], as in \"I would've\", but I prefer to just write \\[\u0259v] in these contexts as \"have\". \n\nAside from *\\-n't* \"contractions\" (which linguistically behave more like single words than contractions) and subject pronoun \\+ auxiliary contractions, it's not that common to indicate \"reduced\" pronunciations in writing. People pronounce schwa in words like *of* or *to* but the written vowel in these words is very rarely replaced with an apostrophe."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about contractions in English is most accurate?\n\nA) Contractions can be freely used in writing with any subject, including non-pronoun subjects like \"Jane and Kate're\" or \"Their children're\".\n\nB) Contractions with 're are only acceptable in writing when used with subject pronouns that end in vowels, such as \"we're\", \"you're\", and \"they're\".\n\nC) In spoken English, the vowel in \"are\" can be reduced to a schwa sound after consonant-ending subjects, but this is not typically represented with an apostrophe in formal writing.\n\nD) Contractions should never be used in either spoken or written English when the subject is not a pronoun.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the nuances discussed in the documentation. In spoken English, it's common to reduce \"are\" to a schwa sound even after subjects ending in consonants. However, in formal writing, it's not standard to represent this reduction with an apostrophe for non-pronoun subjects.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that contractions can be freely used in writing with any subject, which is not standard practice.\n\nOption B is partially correct about pronoun contractions but doesn't address the possibility of vowel reduction in speech for other subjects.\n\nOption D is too extreme, as contractions are widely used in both spoken and written English, especially with pronouns."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/07/17", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/456112", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/308840/"], "docs_id": 456112, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I find the construction \"in the case in which\" slightly cumbersome.

Track, space, drill holes and vias are a differentiators. Some companies might be conservative and quote figures which are well within capability, and others may be at the edge of their capability. \n\nLaen of [OSHpark](https://oshpark.com/) has run some tests on several services offered over the Internet, designed to reveal manufacturing defects. The test PCB's used the finest tolerances offered, and the boards failed. IIRC some percentage of the boards were supposed to have been electrically tested, and were passed, but you should double check that with Laen.\n\nAdvice I was given by some experienced designers is: *avoid* using the smallest track, space, annular ring, holes and vias offered by your PCB manufacturer, *at least* until you get comfortable with their capability. The general advice was use an extra couple of mil (thou) above the PCB manufacturer's limits on track, space and annular ring, and one or two drill sizes larger on vias and drill holes to increase the likelihood of it being made correctly every time. Leave an extra margin around board dimensions and routed holes because defects which short copper surfaces are awful to debug.\n\nOther advice included: \n\n* leave as much copper as you can on the PCB; you paid for it. More\nimportantly, the waste chemical etchant is a material which requires\ncareful handling as a pollutant, so try to minimise the amount of\ncopper removed, and so minimise waste.\n* make annular rings around holes slightly wider, and tracks slightly\nwider if the board is to be soldered by inexperienced people (e.g.\nbeginners). Beginners make more mistakes than production trained staff.\nFor example they often put parts in the wrong holes. When they remove\nthe part, they are likely to overheat a small pad, and pull it off too,\nruining the PCB.\n\nEdit: I defer to Andy aka, and other experienced community members on PCB design.\n\nThe advice I have is try to ensure 'islands' are connected to a relatively continuous ground plane using vias, and not disconnected. This is especially true around low analogue voltages and higher frequencies, where 20MHz is definitely 'high frequency'; I do MCU boards, where most high frequencies are internal to the MCU or communication interfaces e.g. USB where I take special care. Disconnected areas which are not in those contexts I might leave, especially if I am worried about heat dissipation, though I rarely have disconnected areas.\n\nHowever, I do get experienced people to give my PCBs a review. You might consider asking for a review here.

This practice increases the likelihood of the board being manufactured correctly every time and helps avoid potential issues with manufacturing defects. Additionally, it makes the board more robust for soldering, especially if done by inexperienced individuals.

I tried to refactor code the brute way, i.e. by trying to guess what the code is doing and what changes wouldn't change it meaning, but without success: it randomly breaks features all around the codebase.\n\nNote that refactoring includes moving legacy C\\# code to a more functional style (the legacy code doesn't use any of the features of .NET Framework 3 and later, including LINQ), adding generics where the code may benefit from them, etc.\n\nI can't use [formal methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), given how much would they cost.\n\nOn the other hand, I presume that at least [\"Any refactored legacy code shall come with unit tests\"](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/155505/6605) rule should be strictly followed, no matter how much would it cost. The problem is that when I refactor a tiny part of a 500 LOC private method, adding unit tests appears to be a difficult task.\n\nWhat can help me in knowing which unit tests are relevant for a given piece of code? I'm guessing that static analysis of the code would somehow be helpful, but what are the tools and techniques I can use to:\n\n* Know exactly what unit tests should I create,\n* And/or know if the change I've done affected the original code in a way that it is executing differently from now?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have had similar challenges. The *Working with Legacy Code* book is a great resource, but there's an assumption that you can shoe\\-horn in unit tests to support your work. Sometimes that's just not possible.\n\nIn my archeology work (my term for maintenance on legacy code like this), I follow a similar approach as to what you outlined.\n\n* Start with a solid understanding of what the routine is currently doing.\n* At the same time, identify what the routine was *supposed* to be doing. Many think this bullet and the previous are the same, but there is a subtle difference. Often times, if the routine was doing what it was supposed to be doing then you wouldn't be applying maintenance changes.\n* Run some samples through routine and make sure you hit the boundary cases, relevant error paths, along with the mainline path. My experience is that the collateral damage (feature breakage) comes from boundary conditions not being implemented in exactly the same way.\n* After those sample cases, identify what's being persisted that doesn't necessarily need to be persisted. Again, I have found that it's side\\-effects like this that lead to collateral damage elsewhere.\n\nAt this point, you should have a candidate list of what's been exposed and / or manipulated by that routine. Some of those manipulations are likely to be inadvertent. Now I use `findstr` and the IDE to understand what other areas might reference the items in the candidate list. I'll spend some time understanding how those references are working and what their nature is.\n\nFinally, once I've deluded myself into thinking I understand the impacts of the original routine, I'll make my changes one\\-at\\-a\\-time and rerun the analysis steps I outlined above to verify that the change is working as I expect it to work. I specifically try to avoid changing multiple things at once as I have found this blows up on me when I try and verify the impact. Sometimes you can get away with multiple changes, but if I can follow a one\\-at\\-a\\-time route, that's my preference.\n\nIn short, my approach is similar to what you laid out.

The exercise is then to calculate the CoM velocity and rotation speed after the collision.\n\nA standard solution to this is to set up two equations:\n\n* **angular momentum conservation** about the axis perpendicular to $v\\_0$ and through the collision point\n* **energy conservation** of the rod, since the collision is elastic and the spike is held in place, i.e. the rod's energy does not change\n\nA friend of mine then (either by ingenious intuition or by remembering it from our dynamics course) claimed that angular momentum conservation (which can be slightly annoying to write down) can be **replaced by the following condition: the velocity in the spike frame of the point on the rod that touches the spike is reversed.**\n\nTo my surprise it worked for the specific question we were doing, we got the same result using both calculations. Now my question:\n\n1. Is this actually true for inelastic collisions in general or some kind of coincidence? I haven't tried to prove it, but I think if it is true that should be straightforward. This is not my main question though, since I believe it is probably true in general.\n2. Now assuming that it is true: **Why on earth is it true??** As in: is there an easy explanation or does it just come out of the math? The reason I find this so astonishing is that angular momentum conservation and energy conservation apply *globally* and it is important that the rod is a **rigid body**. It seems amazing to me that one can replace that by a simple and completely *local* condition, that tells you how *one point* of the rigid body will move.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"trick\" only works for elastic collisions, for which the relative velocities of approach and separation are equal and opposite, when measured along the common normal at the point of contact :  \n\n$v\\_2\\-v\\_1 \\= u\\_2\\-u\\_1$. \n\nIn general we can write :  \n\n$v\\_2\\-v\\_1\\=e(u\\_2\\-u\\_1\\)$  \n\nwhere $e$ is the Coefficient of Restitution. For elastic collisions $e\\=1$; for inealstic collisions $0 \\\\le e \\\\lt 1$.\n\nSince relative velocities are being compared, the \"trick\" also works in the frame of reference of the rod. It can be applied in other reference frames also, but in such frames it is more difficult to distinguish between normal and tangential components of motion/forces.\n\nThe \"trick\" can be deduced from both conservation of kinetic energy and linear momentum (see Wikipedia article on [Elastic Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#One-dimensional_Newtonian)). Therefore using it is equivalent to using one of the two conservation equations. You can combine it with either, whichever is the more convenient \\- usually (IMO) conservation of momentum is the easier to apply.\n\n---\n\nI think the key which answers your doubt over *why* the above works for extended bodies when it is derived for linear collisions between point particles, is your own observation that the collision occurs between **rigid bodies**. Because of this there is a clear point or plane of contact, and the collision is instantaneous compared with the time required for any other motion, such as rotation. Under these conditions, the collision can be modelled as a linear collision between a point particle and a plane \\- the spike being the point particle and the rod the plane.\n\nIf there were significant deformation of either body, contact would be along a non\\-planar surface, and would take a finite time, during which one or both bodies rotate, with the result that the collision would be considerably more difficult to model."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A thin rod of mass M and length L is moving with velocity v0 when it collides elastically with a fixed spike at a distance d from its center of mass. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the analysis of this collision?\n\nA) Angular momentum conservation about the collision point can always be replaced by the condition that the velocity of the rod's contact point with the spike is reversed in the spike's frame, regardless of the collision's elasticity.\n\nB) The \"trick\" of reversing the velocity of the contact point in the spike's frame is equivalent to using both conservation of energy and conservation of linear momentum.\n\nC) The collision can be modeled as instantaneous and treated as a linear collision between a point particle (spike) and a plane (rod) due to the rod's rigidity.\n\nD) If there was significant deformation of the rod during collision, the \"trick\" would still be applicable but would require additional considerations for rotational effects.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key insight is that for rigid bodies, the collision can be modeled as instantaneous and treated as a linear collision between a point particle (the spike) and a plane (the rod). This simplification allows for the application of the \"trick\" where the velocity of the contact point is reversed in the spike's frame.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the \"trick\" only works for elastic collisions, not for inelastic ones.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the \"trick\" is equivalent to using one conservation law (either energy or momentum), not both simultaneously.\n\nOption D is incorrect because significant deformation would invalidate the assumptions that make the \"trick\" work, as it would introduce non-planar contact and finite collision time, making the problem much more complex."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/11/13", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/260430", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/158918/"], "docs_id": 260430, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently installed luxury vinyl plank in our kitchen. Prior to the installation, there was a section of hardwood and a section of carpet. I took out the hardwood so that I would be able to have a level surface for all of the LVP to be installed on.\n\nThe hardware was glued down to sheets of particleboard and pulling up the hardwood did a lot of damage to the particleboard. I did what I could to fill in the bumps, but after installing it, there are sections where it just feels uneven to walk on, with slight divots in different places. If I could go back, I would have cut out the particleboard under the hardwood and replace it with new particleboard.\n\nI\u2019m concerned that these divots might cause damage to the LVP over time, and of course I would like it to feel a bit better to walk on. Has anyone been in a similar situation to me? Did you leave it as is and was it fine over time? (I feel like I might be extra sensitive about walking on it, because it was just installed). Would it be worth dismantling the LVP and putting new particleboard underneath the uneven section?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the divots and unevenness occur in frequently walked areas, you risk damaging the tight connection and seal between the planks. The planks will start to separate with unsightly kitchen grime collecting in the tiny gaps. Further, spills might seep into these cracks, causing permanent water damage or becoming the source of foul odour.\n\nYou might also experience cracking of the planks. Replacing a plank is laborious if not impossible, and hopefully you have extras set aside.\n\nIn less walked portions of the kitchen small unevenness would not be a problem, even if noticeable.\n\nSo assess the location of the imperfection, and lean towards re\\-laying if in doubt.\n\nYou don't have to replace the subfloor, and instead lay 1/4in or 3/8in plywood over it. Filling with self levelling cement is another option, but you'll need a special highly\\-flexible formulation for applicaiton on a wood subfloor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner recently installed luxury vinyl plank (LVP) flooring in their kitchen over an uneven particleboard subfloor.

Assessing the location of imperfections allows the homeowner to focus on areas that are most likely to cause issues, particularly in frequently walked areas. Adding a layer of plywood over the existing subfloor can help create a more even surface without the need to completely replace the particleboard. This approach also aligns with the expert advice provided in the documentation, which suggests using plywood as a solution.

Would something like this be accurate?:\n\n```\nnetstat -np | grep ESTABLISHED | grep nginx | wc -l\n\n```\n\nEnd Edit\n\nAaron\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Currently you have pretty low load according to the bandwidth utilization. There is a lot of possible bottlenecks, to name few:\n\n**Network related**\n\nAs the number of connections grows, you can hit `worker_connections` limit of an Nginx worker process. The racyclist's description is pretty good, I'll just add few cents to it. Actually the more workers you have, the more possiblity you can hit `worker_connections` of one particular worker. The reason for that is Nginx master process cannot guarantee even distribution of connections between the workers \\-\\- some of them can process requests faster than others and thus the limit can be exceeded finally.\n\nMy advice is to use as few workers as possible with large number of `worker_connections`. However you will have to increase the number of workers if you have IO (see later). Use nginx's `status` module to watch the number of sockets it uses.\n\nYou shall likely hit OS (Linux or FreeBSD) limit on the number of per\\-process open file descriptors. Nginx will use descriptors not only for incoming requests, but for outgoing connections to backends as well. Initially this limit is set to the very low value (e.g. 1024\\). Nginx will complain in its `error.log` on this event.\n\nIf you are using `iptables` and its conntrack module (Linux), you shall exceed the size of `conntrack` table as well. Watch out `dmesg` or `/var/log/messages`. Increase this limit as necessary.\n\nSome very good optimized applications utilize 100% bandwidth. My bet is that you shall face previous problem(s) before.\n\n**IO related**\n\nIn fact, a Nginx worker blocks on IO. Thus if your site is serving static content, you will need to increase the number of Nginx workers to account for IO blocking. It's hard to give recipes here, as they vary a lot depending on the number and size of files, type of load, available memory, etc.\n\nIf you are proxying connections to some backend through Nginx, you should take into account that it creates temporary files to store the backend's answer and in the case of high traffic this can result in substantial load on the filessystem. Watch for messages in Nginx's `error.log` and tune `proxy_buffers` (or `fastcgi_buffers`) accordingly.\n\nIf you have some background IO (e.g. MySQL), it will affect static files serving as well.

To prove week duality, we define the primal set $$S\\=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in X: g\\_i(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\leq 0, h\\_j(\\\\mathbf{x})\\=0, i\\=1,\\\\dots,m,\\\\; j\\=1,\\\\dots, p\\\\}.$$ Then for any $(\\\\lambda,\\\\mu)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^m\\_\\+\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^p$ we have\n\\\\begin{aligned} q(\\\\lambda,\\\\mu)\\&\\=\\\\min\\_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in X} L(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\lambda,\\\\mu)\\\\\\\\ \n\\&\\\\leq \\\\min\\_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in S} L(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\lambda,\\\\mu) \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\\\min\\_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in S} \\\\Big\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m\\\\lambda\\_i g\\_i(\\\\mathbf{x})\\+\\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^p\\\\mu\\_j h\\_j(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\Big]\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\\\leq \\\\min\\_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in S} f(\\\\mathbf{x})\n\\\\end{aligned}\nwhere the last inequality follows from the fact that $\\\\lambda\\_i\\\\geq 0$ and $g\\_i(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\leq 0$. If you change this, then you don't have weak duality anymore."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of convex optimization and duality theory, why is the constraint \u03bb \u2265 0 (componentwise) used in the dual problem formulation instead of \u03bb \u2264 0, even when the primal problem involves minimization with \u2264 inequality constraints?\n\nA) To ensure the dual problem is always a maximization problem, regardless of the primal problem's nature.\nB) To maintain the weak duality property, which is crucial for the relationship between primal and dual solutions.\nC) To simplify the computational complexity of solving the dual problem.\nD) To convert all primal constraints into equality constraints in the Lagrangian function.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The constraint \u03bb \u2265 0 is used in the dual problem formulation to maintain the weak duality property. This property is fundamental in optimization theory as it establishes that the optimal value of the dual problem is always less than or equal to the optimal value of the primal problem. \n\nThe key lies in the construction of the Lagrangian function and how it relates to the primal constraints. For inequality constraints of the form g_i(x) \u2264 0, multiplying them by non-negative Lagrange multipliers (\u03bb_i \u2265 0) ensures that when these constraints are satisfied, their contribution to the Lagrangian is non-positive. This is crucial for establishing the inequality in the weak duality theorem.\n\nIf we were to use \u03bb \u2264 0 instead, the inequality in the weak duality proof would be reversed, breaking the fundamental relationship between the primal and dual problems. The choice of \u03bb \u2265 0 is not arbitrary but is mathematically necessary to preserve the theory and properties of duality in optimization."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/03", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/74839", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/25997/"], "docs_id": 74839, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've learned that a resistor converts some electrical energy into heat energy while the current flows through it and thus causes a power loss, but what if there's not any resistance in a circuit. Will current still flow?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A wire is just a very small resistor. The limiting case is a [superconductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity).

When \\\\$R\\=0\\\\$, then you are [dividing by zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero) and the universe explodes. Fortunately, all wires and things we use as voltage sources (batteries, lab power supplies, wall warts...) have some (very small) resistance, so this doesn't happen in practice.\n\nTo know what the use of resistance is, consider what would happen if we had none. Voltage is the result of current that wants to flow, but can't. If there were no resistance, then all the current in the universe could flow, and pretty soon, all the electrical energy in the universe would be depleted, leaving you with no voltage anywhere, and no way to do any electrical [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_%28physics%29).\n\nAs long as we are considering what happens as the resistance gets smaller, we might as well consider what happens as it gets bigger:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fK50U.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2ffK50U.png)\n\nThat is, as the resistance gets higher, less current flows.

However, in practice, this doesn't occur because all real components, including wires and voltage sources, have some inherent resistance. This prevents the theoretical \"division by zero\" scenario. Superconductors come close to zero resistance but are not typically found in everyday circuits. Option B is incorrect because current increases, not decreases, as resistance approaches zero. Option C contradicts Ohm's law, which shows that current changes with resistance.

This method is called by the UI component framework to apply filters to the data source. \n\nBy implementing public function addFilter(\\Magento\\Framework\\Api\\Filter $filter) { return null; }, you're essentially telling the framework that filtering is not applicable for this particular form, which is appropriate when you don't have a collection to filter.\n\nOption A (getData()) is already implemented in the given code and returns an empty array, which is correct for a form without pre-existing data, but it doesn't address the filtering issue.\n\nOption B (addFieldToFilter()) is typically a method used on collections, not on the DataProvider itself, so it's not the correct choice for this scenario.\n\nOption D (getCollection()) is not the right approach because the issue stems from not having a collection in the first place.

You have to experimentally validate the assumptions of the proof which demand the conclusion as true. But what if the assumptions have already been experimentally validated? \n\nFor example, if I show that if certain physical laws or accepted theories are true, a model must be (I'm not aware of such a proof, or if one exists), since the assumptions have been validated, do I still need to go through the trouble of experimentation? If we've shown it would be logically inconsistent for a conclusion to be false, and we take data that seems to be contradicting it, what's more likely to be false or mistaken \\- our logic, or our tools/experiment? I imagine that if scientists ever claimed to have found a right triangle in nature that violates Pythagorean's theorem, it would be more logical to assume they made a mistake.\n\nThe reason I ask this is because most, if not just about all of the ToEs in theoretical physics pretty much only have their mathematics going for them. The one most infamous for this is string theory. If string theory could be mathematically proven in the way I presented, and this proof was independently replicated and stood the test of time in the same way the Pythagorean theorem has, do we need to go through all the trouble of actually making an experiment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Physics remains an experimental science and so it is not possible to replace experiment by a proof.

Having found these values I can now plug them in Newton's law of uniform gravitation $F \\= \\\\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ with G being the gravitational constant, M being the sum of the masses of planet 1 and 2, m being the mass of planet 3 and r being the distance from the center of mass to planet 3\\. Plugging these values gives me $F \\= 4\\.87 \\\\cdot 10^8 N$. \n\nBut the problem I'm having is that I get a different value if I were to calculate the froces from planet 1 and planet 2 separately (which is also how the model answer does it). \n\nCalculating the forces separately:\n$\\\\newcommand{\\\\uvec}\\[1]{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{\\#1}}}}$\n\n$\\\\vec{F}\\_{1,3} \\= 3\\.335 \\\\cdot 10^8 N \\\\uvec{i}$ (just plugging the values in Newton's law of uniform gravitation).

In order to write this as a vector, I need to find the angle $\\\\theta$ first, $\\\\theta \\= \\\\arctan{\\\\frac{10^{10}m}{2 \\\\cdot 10^{10}m}} \\= 26\\.565\u00ba$. This gives $\\\\vec{F}\\_{2, 3} \\= F\\_{2, 3} \\\\cdot \\\\cos({\\\\arctan{0\\.5}}) \\\\uvec{i} \\+ F\\_{2, 3} \\\\cdot \\\\sin({\\\\arctan{0\\.5}}) \\\\uvec{j}$ which is roughly equal to $\\\\vec{F}\\_{2, 3} \\= 1\\.193 \\\\cdot 10^8 N \\\\uvec{i} \\+ 0\\.5966 \\\\cdot 10^8 N \\\\uvec{j}$.

Shouldn't they be the same since the gravitational force points towards the center of mass or is my way of thinking flawed? \n\n(Disclaimer: it is very possible that I made a dumb mistake or made a rounding error, sorry if that would be the case)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> the gravitational force points towards the center of mass or is my way of thinking flawed?\n\nThat can be an erroneous assumption. If the distribution of mass being analyzed is spherical, Newton's gravitational force works out to \"point towards the center of mass.\" So, for each of your planets you can analyze them as being point masses. Your $M\\_1$ and $M\\_2$ planets do **not** form a spherical distribution of mass, so the assumption will fail, as your math shows.\n\nWhen we analyze small masses on Earth we are dealing with small volumes, and more importantly, we are assuming a constant gravitational field across the object.

In this planetary system, m1 and m2 do not form a spherical distribution, so treating them as a single mass at their center of mass would lead to incorrect results.

I'm Replacing it with new 200\\-amp service and all load wiring has been updated and includes ground wiring. The easiest transformation is to add a room and convert the exterior wall where the old panel is to an interior wall and simply put the new panel facing the new room to meet code and avoid a j\\-box.

I'm assuming the 2\\-2\\-2\\-4 SER Al is rated to enter the house to the panel. \n\nOther than the \\#4 ground wire from the new disconnect to the old panel, does the subpanel also need a \\#6 bare copper ground from the ground bar to a copper ground rod?

Yes, to do it properly, the existing 100 amp panel must have the neutral \"floated\" (insulated) and not bonded to the ground. All neutrals must go to the neutral busbar and all grounds must be connected to the grounding busbar. Since you have 4 wire from the temporary service, you no longer need the ground rods for the 100 amp service. In fact, I think it's probably not even allowed anymore. Your connection assumptions are correct. Will you be gutting the old panel and basically turn it into a big j\\-box? That's what I've done in the past and inspectors are fine with it. Being in a cabinet may force the issue going forward.\n\nRegarding the other sub\\-panel in your workshop, if you have 4 wire feed to it, it's the same drill as your other soon\\-to\\-be subpanel...float the neutral and use separate wires for neutral and ground. You shouldn't need a local grounding rod there either anymore.

In this scenario, where a 4-wire feed (including a separate ground wire) is coming from the new main disconnect, a separate ground rod for the subpanel is not necessary and may not be allowed.

It seems (see below) that some measures follow Gaussian distribution and some do not.\n* All these measurements were done 3 times during the study.\n\nAssuming A is body weight. The body weight is measured at three time points during the study. Therefore, I have three body weight measures A1, A2, and A3 for all groups (Control, Treatment 1, Treatment 2\\).

Here are histograms for B1 in two groups (as an example of non\\-normal data):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KeIh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KeIh.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPREx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPREx.png)\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n* We are not 100% sure that Treatment 1 is effective (there is some controversy in the literature about how effective it is), so we included the Control group to see whether Treatment 1 is even effective, then compare it to Treatment 2\\.\n* About the time points, there are three of them (at the beginning, after 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). This is to see how fast or slow are the effects of both treatments, compared to each other and also compared to placebo.\n* While body composition measurements sound depended, it is not always the case. One could loose weight without her BFM changing at all, or it could be solely because of change in BFM.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think one could write a whole book dealing *exclusively* with your question (and I am definitely not qualified to write it). So without any attempt at providing a comprehensive answer, here are some points that can hopefully be helpful.\n\n### Confirmatory vs. exploratory approach to analysis\n\nAs you note yourself, you have a very rich dataset and you can test *a lot of things*. We can quickly compute the number of meaningful tests: you have $12$ measures; each was measured $3$ times in $3$ groups. So if we count all pairwise tests, it will be $3$ tests per group and $3$ tests per measurement time, i.e. $18$ tests per measure, i.e. $216$ tests. You are obviously aware of the lurking multiple comparisons problem (remember the [green beans](https://xkcd.com/882/) comic?), but if you are normally happy to use $\\\\alpha\\=0\\.05$ and were to use e.g. Bonferroni adjustment then you would have to use $\\\\alpha \\= 0\\.05/216\\\\approx 0\\.002$ and to risk not finding any significant effects because you do not have enough power.\n\nThis is of course not a unique, but in fact a very common situation.\n\nBroadly speaking, you can adopt one of the two approaches. \n\n**Confirmatory approach** insists on strict adherence to the rules of significance testing. You should formulate your one or several (but as few as possible) research hypotheses in advance and carefully plan which statistical tests you are going to carry out. To mitigate the multiple comparisons / low power problem, you should try to design your tests such that you use as few tests as possible while having maximal power to detect what you really want to detect. For example, you might want to combine your measures into some composite or pooled measures that are likely to be most affected by Treatment 1 or 2\\. Or you can pool over measurement times. Etc. In any case, you try to boil down all your data to a couple of *crucial* comparisons, and then you do only those, applying Bonferroni (or similar) adjustment. It's important that all of that is planned before you have ever looked at the data (because after looking at the data you will be tempted to change your tests).\n\nAlas, in practice, this is often hardly possible.\n\n**Exploratory approach,** in contrast, is like biting the bullet: you have a lot of rich data, so why not explore all sorts of relationships that are present in there. You will do lots of comparisons and lots of tests, you will adjust your analysis strategy depending on what you see in the data, but whatever \\-\\- this is all exploratory. You cannot do that if you are doing a clinical trial, but in more basic research this if often the only way to go. All $p$\\-values that you get out of this approach should be taken with a (big) grain of salt, though. In fact, some would say that you should not run or report any significance tests at all, but usually tests are still done. There is a good argument not to use multiple comparisons adjustments (such as Bonferroni) at all, and rather treat all the $p$\\-values as indicating strength of evidence in the Fisherian sence (as opposed to leading to a yes/no decision in the Neyman\\-Pearson sence).\n\n### Statistical tests if you are willing to assume normality\n\nLet's for the moment ignore the issue of normality (see below) and assume that everything is normal. You have the following battery of tests:\n\n1. For each measure, within\\-group pairwise comparison between two measurement times is a *paired t\\-test*. It will test if the measurements differ between these two times.\n2. For each measure, between\\-group pairwise comparison for one measurement time is an *unpaired t\\-test*. It will test if these two groups differ on this specific measurement.\n3. For each measure, within\\-group comparison between all three different measurement times is a *repeated measures ANOVA*. It will test if measurement time has any effect at all.\n4. For each measure, between\\-group comparison between for one fixed measurement time, is a *one\\-way ANOVA*. It will test if groups differ in any way between each other.\n5. For each measure, comparison between all groups and all times is a *two\\-way repeated measures ANOVA*. It will test if there is a significant effect of group, significant effect of time, and significant interaction between them.\n6. For all measures, comparison between all groups and all times is a *two\\-way repeated measures MANOVA*. It will test if there is a significant effect of group, significant effect of time, or significant interaction between them on all measures taken together.\n\nNote that \\#1 and \\#2 can be seen as a post\\-hocs to \\#3 and \\#4 respectively, \\#3 and \\#4 can be seen as post\\-hocs to \\#5, and \\#5 can be seen as post\\-hoc to \\#6\\.\n\n\\[With an additional complication then when these tests are done as post\\-hocs they use some of the pooled estimates of the \"parent\" test in order to be more consistent with it; I am not sure though if these procedures exist on the higher levels of the hierarchy.]\n\nSo you have a layered structure and you can proceed in the top\\-down manner from the most general (\\#6\\) level down to most specific (\\#1 and \\#2\\) tests and run each next level only if you have significant *omnibus* effect on the higher level (apologies for the potential confusion; \"higher\" levels have higher numbers in my list and hence are located on the bottom of it... \"top\\-down\" means starting with MANOVA in \\#6 and going until t\\-tests in \\#1 and \\#2\\). This should protect you from false positives on the lower level, and so you arguably (!) don't need to do multiple comparison adjustments on the lower level (but as far as I understand, opinions on that differ).\n\nYou can also start directly at some middle layer and e.g. run 12 times \\#5 without doing \\#6, or 36 times \\#3 and 36 times \\#4 without doing \\#5\\. In confirmatory framework, you must then apply some multiple comparison correction (such as Bonferroni or rather Holm\\-Bonferroni). In exploratory framework this is not necessary, see above (example: maybe without adjustment you get $p\\=0\\.01$ effect in many different measures and it is very consistent; you are probably looking at a real effect then, but if you make Bonferroni adjustment then everything will stop being significant \\-\\- too bad. Instead, in exploratory framework you should rather keep $p\\=0\\.01$ as is and use your own expert judgment, but of course at your own risk).\n\nBy the way, if your Treatments work at all, you should expect significant effect of interaction in \\#6 and \\#5, so these are (hopefully!) almost guaranteed, and the interesting stuff begins at layers \\#3 and \\#4\\. If there is a real danger that both Treatments are as bad as placebo then perhaps you should really start with \\#6\\.\n\n**Another remark:** a more \"modern\" approach would be to use a linear mixed model (with subjects being a random effect) instead of repeated measures ANOVA, but that's a whole other topic that I am not very familiar with. It would be great if somebody posted an answer here written from a mixed models perspective.\n\n### Statistical tests if you are not willing to assume normality\n\nThere are ranked analogues of most of these tests, but not of all of them. The analogues are as follows:\n\n1. Wilcoxon test\n2. Mann\\-Whitney\\-Wilcoxon test\n3. Friedman test\n4. Kruskal\\-Wallis test\n5. ?? (probably does not exist)\n6. ???? (most probably does not exist, but see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/133444))\n\nAdditional complication is that post\\-hocs become tricky. Proper post\\-hoc to Kruskal\\-Wallis is not Mann\\-Whitney\\-Wilcoxon but the Dunn's test \\[it takes into account the issue that I mentioned in the square brackets above]. Similarly, proper post\\-hoc to Friedman is not Wilcoxon; not sure if it exists but if it does it is even more obscure than Dunn's.\n\n### Normality testing\n\nIt is in general a very bad idea to test for normality in order to decide whether you should use parametric or nonparametric tests. It will affect your $p$\\-values in an unpredictable way. At least in the confirmatory paradigm, you should decide on the test *prior to looking at the data*; if you have doubts about normality approximation, then rather don't use it. See here for more discussion: [Choosing a statistical test based on the outcome of another (e.g. normality)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/61715).\n\nIn your case, this means that you should use only parametric tests or only nonparametric tests for all measures (unless you have *a priori* grounds to suspect substantial deviations from normality in only a specific subset of measures; this does not seem to be the case).\n\nIn simple cases people often suggest to use ranked tests because they are powerful, simple, and you don't need to worry about the assumptions. But in your case, nonparametric tests will be a mess so you have a good argument in favour of classical ANOVAs. By the way, the histograms that you posted look \"normal enough\" to me that with your sample size you should not worry too much about them not being normal.\n\n### Data presentation\n\nI would strongly advice to rely on visualization as opposed to only listing hundreds of $p$\\-values in a text or a table. With the data like that, first thing I would do (note: this is very exploratory!), would be to make a giant figure with 12 subplots, where each subplot corresponds to one measure and shows time on the x\\-axis (three measurements) and groups as lines of different color (with error bars).\n\nThen just stare at this figure for really long and try to see if it makes sense. Hopefully the effects will be consistent across measures, across time points, etc. I would make this figure the main figure of the paper.\n\nIf you like, you can then pepper this figure with the results of your statistical tests (mark significant differences with stars).\n\n---\n\n### Brief answers to your specific questions\n\n1. Yes (almost \\-\\- see the caveat about Wilcoxon as post\\-hoc)\n2. Yes\n3. Yes\n4. Use figures as much as you can.\n\n### Word of caution\n\n> We would like to know if Treatment 2 (Dietary Supplement 2\\) has the same effect (or even better) on body composition than Treatment 1, while not having those adverse effects on blood profiles.\n\nTo show that Treatment 2 does not have as much adverse effects as Treatment 1, it's not enough to show that there is significant difference between T1 and Controls but no significant difference between T2 and Controls. This is a common mistake. You actually need to show significant difference between T2 and T1\\.\n\n---\n\n**Further reading:**\n\n* [Multiple Comparisons with Repeated Measures](http://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/RepMeasMultComp/RepMeasMultComp.html) \\-\\- tutorial focused on SPSS but with a really good discussion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a study on the effects of two dietary supplements on body composition and blood profiles.

It starts with the most general test (MANOVA) to control for multiple comparisons across all measures, then proceeds to more specific tests (repeated measures ANOVAs) only if justified by significant overall effects. This top-down approach helps control the family-wise error rate while still allowing for detailed analysis of significant effects. Post-hoc tests are conducted only when warranted by significant main effects or interactions, further controlling unnecessary comparisons. This approach also takes into account the repeated measures design and potential interactions between treatment and time, which are crucial for addressing the research question about the comparative effects of the two treatments over time. Options A and C don't account for the repeated measures design appropriately, while option D's approach of choosing tests based on normality testing is generally not recommended and could lead to unpredictable effects on p-values."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/18", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/152695", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/55576/"], "docs_id": 152695, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are some devices that allow to connect laptops to High Definition TVs.

I see nothing in the logs and the program continues to run as usual until I hit Ctrl\\-C in the terminal I launched it from.\n\nAre there any differences between how Ctrl\\-C sends the signal and how kill does?\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe program in question is a Java application launched by a bash shell script which sets up some environment variables (namely `CLASSPATH`) and then calls `java [main class]`. Hitting Ctrl\\-Z and then running `ps` results in the following:\n\n```\n$ ps -f\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\nmdeck    10251 10250  0 11:48 pts/2    00:00:00 -bash\nmdeck    13405 10251  0 18:12 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp.sh\nmdeck    13509 13405 25 18:12 pts/2    00:00:03 java com.company.MyApp\nmdeck    13526 10251  0 18:13 pts/2    00:00:00 ps -f\n\n```\n\nThe output of stty as requested by Gilles is below:\n\n```\n$ stty -a </dev/pts/2\nspeed 38400 baud; rows 40; columns 203; line = 0;\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; eol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;\n-parenb -parodd cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts\n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl ixon -ixoff -iuclc -ixany -imaxbel -iutf8\nopost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0 ff0\nisig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt echoctl echoke\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One possibility is that the program catches the `Ctrl`\\+`C` sequence. Check the output of `stty -a`; the `intr` setting indicates which key combination (if any) sends a SIGINT signal, and the `isig` indicates whether the signal keys are enabled (`-isig` means they are disabled).\n\nIf the program consists of several processes, pressing `Ctrl`\\+`C` sends SIGINT to all the processes in the [process group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group). You can obtain the same effect by sending the signal to the process group instead of sending it to one of the processes. To send a signal to a process group, first determine its leader: that's the first process that starts all the others; if you run the process group in the background, that's the PID shown by `jobs -l`. The PID of the process group leader is the PGID (process group id); send the signal to its negative. E.g. if the PGID is 1234, run `kill -INT -1234`.\n\nIf the program consists of a wrapper script and a main application, there are two cases to consider. If there is no cleanup to do, so that the wrapper script terminates as soon as the main aplication terminates, make the wrapper script call `exec`:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nexport SOMEVAR=somevalue\n\u2026\nexec /path/to/application \"$@\"\n\n```\n\nThis way the application replaces the script, inheriting its PID. Some shells optimize a script that ends by executing another program, but not all. This approach doesn't work when the script needs to perform some cleanup such as removing temporary files.\n\nConsider making the script detect a signal and transmitting the signal to the application. Here's a sketch of how this goes:\n\n```\n/path/to/application \"$@\" &\napp_pid=$!\ntrap -INT 'kill -INT $app_pid'\nwait $!\nrm /temp/file\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When developing a Java application that handles SIGINT for graceful shutdown, you notice that Ctrl+C works as expected, but sending SIGINT via the `kill` command doesn't. Which of the following is the most likely explanation and solution for this behavior?\n\nA) The Java application is catching the Ctrl+C sequence directly. Check the `stty -a` output to verify the `intr` setting and ensure `isig` is enabled.\n\nB) The signal is not reaching the main Java process. Modify the bash wrapper script to use `exec` when launching the Java application, allowing it to inherit the script's PID.\n\nC) The application consists of multiple processes. Send the signal to the entire process group by using the negative PGID with the `kill` command.\n\nD) The bash wrapper script is intercepting the signal. Modify the script to include a trap for SIGINT and forward it to the Java application.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation for this behavior is that the application consists of multiple processes, as evidenced by the `ps -f` output showing both a bash script and a Java process. When Ctrl+C is pressed in the terminal, it sends SIGINT to all processes in the process group. However, when using `kill` with a specific PID, only that process receives the signal.\n\nThe correct solution is to send the signal to the entire process group. This can be done by determining the process group ID (PGID) and using its negative value with the `kill` command. For example, if the PGID is 1234, you would use `kill -INT -1234`.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while checking `stty` settings is useful for debugging Ctrl+C issues, it doesn't explain the discrepancy between Ctrl+C and `kill` behavior.\n\nOption B is not the best solution because using `exec` in the wrapper script would only be helpful if there's no cleanup needed after the Java application exits.\n\nOption D could potentially work, but it's more complex and doesn't address the root cause of why `kill` behaves differently from Ctrl+C."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/04", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1021865", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/678152/"], "docs_id": 1021865, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I built the required module for the 8821ce chip from source (<https://github.com/endlessm/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/wireless/rtl8821ce>). 2\\.4GHz wifi is working fine, however 5GHz as well as bluetooth is not available.\nDo I miss something or is it just not implemented completely by now?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Try that from your home directory\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/tomaspinho/rtl8821ce.git\ncd rtl8821ce/\nsudo make all\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe -a 8821ce\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user has built a module for the 8821ce wireless chip from source, but is experiencing issues with 5GHz WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity.

You connect the circuit consisting of the solenoid, voltage limiting resistor, flyback diode and MOSFET in parallel with the arduino. You'd connect the \\+9 V to both the arduino DC positive and the solenoid, and you'd connect the ground to both the arduino DC negative and the MOSFET drain pin.\n2. A solenoid which dissipates 1\\.6 W at 6 V will indeed draw 1\\.6/6 \\= 267 mA. However, using a 23 ohm resistor for dropping the 9 V supply voltage to 6 V won't work; 23\\*0\\.267 \\= \\~6 V. You calculated the resistance of the solenoid, not the extra resistance needed for 9 V operation (which is 11\\.25 ohms, 0\\.8 W).\n3. That should be all you need, but I'd add a capacitor (0\\.1 \\- 10 uF) between the 9 V supply and ground for good measure, to prevent voltage transients from coupling to the microcontroller on the arduino board.

Control the solenoid with a MOSFET and add a flyback diode.\n\nC) Connect the 9V supply in parallel to both the Arduino and the solenoid circuit.

It correctly uses the 9V supply for both the Arduino and solenoid circuit in parallel. The 11.25 ohm resistor properly drops the voltage for the 6V solenoid (calculated as (9V - 6V) / 0.267A). The logic-level MOSFET allows proper control from the Arduino, while the flyback diode protects against voltage spikes.

Does that mean the byte code is represented as c code by the interpreter and then its carried out as c code ?\n\nwhat exactly does it mean when we say python interpreter is written in c/java? how do they differ in their process of converting byte code into machine code?\n\nwhat exactly does the interpreter do with the Byte code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For all practical purposes, bytecode is just a data structure that is convenient for an interpreter to use. The interpreter looks at each instruction in the byte code and immediately performs that action.\n\nA simple interpreter for arithmetic expressions might look like this when written in Python:\n\n```py\nbytecode = [\n  {'type': 'const', 'value': 40},\n  {'type': 'const', 'value': 2},\n  {'type': '+'},\n  {'type': 'print'},\n]\n\nstack = []\n\nfor instruction in bytecode:\n  action = instruction['type']\n  if action == 'const':\n    stack.append(instruction['value'])\n  elif action == '+':\n    right = stack.pop()\n    left = stack.pop()\n    stack.append(left + right)\n  elif action == 'print':\n    print(stack.pop())\n  else:\n    raise TypeError(f'Unknown instruction type {action}')\n\n```\n\nThat is, the interpreter checks the type of the type of the instruction and selects which code snippet to run depending on that action. The interpreter is not *translating* the bytecode into another language in the sense that we'd get a program in that language, but it does map the instructions to code snippets.\n\nThus, the CPython interpreter does not translate Python bytecode into C code, but selects which C code snippet to run depending on the instruction.\n\nThis is useful, because generating C code that works correctly *and* is as fast as expected from C is quite tricky. Interpreters typically spend a lot of time doing extra bookkeeping (like reference counting), and in the dispatch logic itself \u2013 that loop through all instructions isn't quite free.\n\nPrograms that translate a source language into another language are sometimes called a *transpiler* (a kind of compiler that doesn't output machine code). It is easy to create a transpiler that just calls into the code snippets of an interpreter (sometimes called *threaded code* in older literature):\n\n```py\nbytecode = [\n  {'type': 'const', 'value': 40},\n  {'type': 'const', 'value': 2},\n  {'type': '+'},\n  {'type': 'print'},\n]\n\n# built-in function for our \"compiled\" code to call\n\ndef do_const(stack, value):\n  stack.append(value)\n\ndef do_add(stack):\n  right = stack.pop()\n  left = stack.pop()\n  stack.append(left + right)\n\ndef do_print(stack):\n  print(stack.pop())\n\n# assembling Python source code for our \"bytecode\"\ncode = 'stack = []\\n'\nfor instruction in bytecode:\n  action = instruction['type']\n  if action == 'const':\n    code += f'do_const(stack, {instruction[\"value\"]})\\n'\n  elif action == '+':\n    code += 'do_add(stack)\\n'\n  elif action == 'print':\n    code += 'do_print(stack)\\n'\n  else:\n    raise TypeError(f'Unknown instruction type {action}')\n\n# we can now execute the code by \"compiling\" it as Python:\nexec(code, locals(), {})\n\n```\n\nThe resulting code might be slightly faster because we've gotten rid of the dispatch logic, but we still have interpreter overhead like stack manipulation. The code we've generated doesn't look like normal Python code. But to get to that Python code we still had to run through our dispatch logic, and now Python has to parse the code we've generated. Similarly, a Python interpreter that translates to C wouldn't be very fast.\n\nThe Java reference implementation OpenJDK/HotSpot is interesting because its runtime combines a just\\-in\\-time compiler with an interpreter. By default, it interprets byte code with an interpreter written in C\\+\\+. But if the same code is executed often enough, it compiles that part of the code directly to machine code. Depending on how important that code is, HotSpot spends more effort on optimizing the machine code. This allows Java to be as fast as C in some benchmarks. CPython is very simplistic in comparison.\n\nThere is (was?) a Python implementation called Jython that was written in Java. Jython works by compiling the Python code to Java byte code. That byte code is then handled by the Java virtual machine, which either interprets it or compiles it on the fly to machine code, as discussed above. Because the Java runtime is awesome this could make that Python code run very fast, in some circumstances. But the added complexity also comes at a cost. Additionally, Jython is not compatible with Python modules that need to interact with internal CPython data structures."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the process of how CPython executes Python code?\n\nA) CPython translates Python bytecode into C code, which is then compiled into machine code for execution.\n\nB) CPython interprets Python bytecode directly, selecting and executing C code snippets based on each bytecode instruction.\n\nC) CPython compiles Python code directly to machine code without an intermediate bytecode step.\n\nD) CPython uses a just-in-time compiler to convert frequently executed bytecode into optimized machine code during runtime.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it accurately describes how CPython works. The interpreter doesn't translate bytecode into C code, but rather executes C code snippets based on each bytecode instruction. This process is more efficient than generating and compiling C code for each Python script.\n\nOption A is incorrect because CPython does not translate bytecode into C code. This would be inefficient and is not how the interpreter operates.\n\nOption C is incorrect because CPython does use an intermediate bytecode step. Python code is first compiled to bytecode before being interpreted.\n\nOption D describes a feature of Java's HotSpot VM, not CPython.

It does not define business process; only visualize business data. The data is represented as components (entities) that are linked with each other by relationships that express the dependencies and requirements between them, such as: one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building. Entities may have various properties (attributes) that characterize them. Diagrams created to represent these entities, attributes, and relationships graphically are called entity\u2013relationship diagrams.\n> \n> \n> An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In the case of a relational database, which stores data in tables, every row of each table represents one instance of an entity. Some data fields in these tables point to indexes in other tables; such pointers are the physical implementation of the relationships.\n\nAnd more specifically\n\n> Crow's foot notation is used in Barker's Notation, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) and information engineering. Crow's foot diagrams represent entities as boxes, and relationships as lines between the boxes. Different shapes at the ends of these lines represent the cardinality of the relationship.\n\nObject diagrams are a slightly different from ER diagrams.\n\n> In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object diagram focuses on some particular set of objects and attributes, and the links between these instances. A correlated set of object diagrams provides insight into how an arbitrary view of a system is expected to evolve over time. In early UML specifications the object diagram is described as:\n> \n> \n> \n> > \"An object diagram is a graph of instances, including objects and data values. A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time. The use of object diagrams is fairly limited, namely to show examples of data structure.\"\n> >  The latest UML 2\\.5 specification does not explicitly define object diagrams, but provides a notation for instances of classifiers.\n> \n> \n> Object diagrams and class diagrams are closely related and use almost identical notation. Both diagrams are meant to visualize static structure of a system. While class diagrams show classes, object diagrams display instances of classes (objects). Object diagrams are more concrete than class diagrams. They are often used to provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams. Only aspects of current interest in a model are typically shown on an object diagram.\n> \n> \n> ### Usage\n> \n> \n> If you are using a UML modeling tool, you will typically draw object diagrams using some other diagram type, such as on a class diagram. An object instance may be called an instance specification or just an instance. A link between instances is generally referred to as a link. Other UML entities, such as an aggregation or composition symbol (a diamond) may also appear on an object diagram."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between Crow's Foot Notation, Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, and UML object diagrams?\n\nA) Crow's Foot Notation is a type of UML object diagram that uses crow's feet symbols to represent relationships between objects.\n\nB) ER diagrams and UML object diagrams are interchangeable, with Crow's Foot Notation being the standard representation for both.\n\nC) Crow's Foot Notation is a specific notation used in some ER diagrams, while UML object diagrams are a distinct concept focusing on instances of classes.\n\nD) UML object diagrams always use Crow's Foot Notation to represent relationships between objects, unlike ER diagrams which use different symbols.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nC is correct because Crow's Foot Notation is indeed a specific notation used in some types of Entity-Relationship diagrams, such as those in Barker's Notation and SSADM.

One thing I suppose I may have asked years ago, got the answer but have completely forgotten it now as it is not something I implicitly use a lot is destructors.

An object will be reclaimed by the garbage collector some time after it has become eligible for collection. This may be after you clear the last reference to it, but it could already be before if you never need the reference anymore after a certain point. But generally, setting a field where you store the instance to `null` will help the object becoming no longer reachable and getting reclaimed.\n\nGenerally you have no control over when objects are reclaimed by the GC. You can write *finalizers* which are methods that are called prior to reclaiming an object, but I'd very much *not* recommend it if you can help it. If you need a predictable way of causing an object to release any resources it might hold on to (what destructors in C\\+\\+ often do), then implement the [`IDisposable` interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable(v=vs.110).aspx):\n\n```\nclass C1 : IDisposable {\n  public void Dispose() {\n    // Do cleanup here\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis also enables you to use instances of that class in a [`using` statement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/yh598w02.aspx), which will call `Dispose` at the end of its block:\n\n```\nusing (var c1 = new C1()) {\n  // do stuf with c1 here\n} // at this point c1.Dispose() is automatically called\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In C#, when dealing with object lifecycle and resource management, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) Setting an object reference to null immediately destroys the object and all its contained objects.\n\nB) Finalizers should be used as the primary method for releasing resources in C# objects.\n\nC) The IDisposable interface and 'using' statements are recommended for predictable resource cleanup.\n\nD) The garbage collector always reclaims objects as soon as the last reference to them is set to null.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect.

I'm using OpenStreetMaps data as my input for water bodies, and I'm using QGis on Ubuntu to process this data. Eventually I would like to be able to take any bounding box as an input, and generate a raster image (2048px by 2048px) that has blue pixels where there is surface water, and black pixels where there is land (or sea; I'm not concerned with ocean water \\- these can be blue or black). Given that most maps/visualisation tools that use OSM data (such as openstreetmaps.org, Overpass, GeoJSON.io, etc) display inland water as solid blue polygons, I'm sure this can't be too hard to achieve!\n\nAt the moment I am trying to do this manually. Ideally this would all be accomplished with free and open source data and software. I intend to create a tool to do this automatically if and when I figure this out. Here is what I have tried:\n\nFirst I grabbed some OSM data representing inland water using the Overpass API at [http://overpass\\-turbo.eu/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) I used the following query:\n\n```\n(\n    way[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({bbox});\n    way[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({bbox});\n    way[\"waterway\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"waterway\"]({bbox});    \n);\n(._;>;);\nout;\n\n```\n\nI then exported this data in GPX format and imported it as a vector layer into QGis. The lakes are all presented as outlines and the rivers as one\\-pixel\\-wide lines. I also imported a simple GeoJSON polygon that represented my bounding box, set it to have a black style, and clipped the other layer to it. I would now like to export the two layers as a 2048x2048 bitmap/png (or similar). I tried to use Raster Menu \\> Conversion \\> Rasterize on just the water layer, but this produced a blank raster. I then tried to use the Print Composer as suggested in an answer to [this question](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/how-to-control-image-output-settings-in-qgis) but this proved to be a lot of work to get it to stretch correctly, and my polygons were not solid but just outlines so I had to fill them in manually.\n\nI must be missing a relatively simple solution here. **How can I generate a simple, 2 colour raster image representing surface water for a given bounding box?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I couldn't get your overpass query to work so I tried building it using the wizard.

So I downloaded a GeoJSON instead \\- same problem. So I saved the GeoJSON to a shapefile instead, and used that.\n\nHowever, I had to manually edit the GDAL command line (using the pencil icon next to the command) and include a \"burn\" value (here, I chose 10\\)\n\n```\ngdal_rasterize -burn 10 -ts 3000 3000 /path/to/my.shp /path/to/generated.tif\n\n```\n\nThis should create a raster with 0 for the background, and 10 where there is water.\n\nI got the same result; a black raster. The reason for this is that the default is to **not** stretch the histogram to the full range of values; instead it clips the bottom and top 2% of values. If fewer than 2% of pixel values are 10, it'll assume the range is 0\\..0, hence the black image.\n\nIf you go into **Layer Properties \\> Rendering \\> Band Rendering**, choose SingleBand Grey, Min/Max, Full Extent, Actual Accuracy and click `Load` it should show the full range of values (0 to 10\\).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t28PD.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t28PD.png)\n\nApply that, and you should now see your waterways. \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbEkJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbEkJ.png)\n\nIn this case I just did one layer, the lines. You might want to use **Merge Shapefiles** to combine your various layers, and rasterize the combined shapefile. \n\nIf that doesn't work (e.g. mixing lines/polygons) you can either\n\n* use **Raster Calculator** to mix your resulting rasters together\n* use **Buffer** on your lines to make them polygons, then merge / rasterize\n\nIt looks a bit \"gritty\", with gaps.

If you are using SVN to house the production site's code, you should have no problems since Subversion has (practically) no concept of sub\\-modules. It won't mind.\n2.

The Brier score (BS) is used to evaluate the performance of this estimator. Which of the following statements about the Brier score is NOT correct?\n\nA) The Brier score is analogous to mean-square error for probability estimation tasks.\nB) The Brier score is a proper scoring rule that favors good calibration of probability models.\nC) The Brier score will always converge to zero as the sample size increases, regardless of the estimator's consistency.\nD) The Brier score can be used to discriminate among different probability models in practice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: The Brier score is indeed analogous to mean-square error for probability estimation tasks, as it measures the average squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes.\n\nB is correct: The Brier score is a proper scoring rule, which means it encourages honest reporting of probabilities and favors well-calibrated probability models.\n\nC is incorrect: While the Brier score will converge to its minimum value for a consistent estimator, it will not necessarily converge to zero, and it certainly won't do so for inconsistent estimators. This convergence depends on the true underlying probability distribution and the consistency of the estimator.\n\nD is correct: The Brier score is commonly used in practice to compare and evaluate different probability models, as evidenced by its frequent mention in statistical discussions and its comparison to other metrics like log-loss.\n\nThe incorrect statement C was chosen because it overstates the properties of the Brier score and ignores the importance of the estimator's consistency, which is a crucial aspect of its behavior as sample size increases."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/09", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/100699", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/61118/"], "docs_id": 100699, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some months after I turned this saddle valve off I turned it back on.

The best repair would be to install a T at the point the saddle valve is attached. This is something most DIY folks can do with plastic or copper pipe a bit more difficult if galvinised pipe. If you stay with a saddle valve get the best quality one you can find."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has a saddle valve on their water line that recently exhibited leaking behavior when turned back on after being off for several months. The leak increased in flow until the valve was fully opened, at which point it stopped. What is the most recommended long-term solution for this issue?\n\nA) Leave the valve as is, since the leaking stopped when fully opened\nB) Replace the saddle valve with another high-quality saddle valve\nC) Install a T-fitting at the point where the saddle valve is attached\nD) Apply plumber's tape to the existing saddle valve to prevent future leaks\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Installing a T-fitting at the point where the saddle valve is attached is the most recommended long-term solution. Saddle valves are known for their tendency to leak and fail within a few years. While replacing it with a higher quality saddle valve (option B) might temporarily solve the problem, it doesn't address the fundamental issue with saddle valve design. \n\nOption A is incorrect because leaving a faulty valve in place could lead to future leaks or failures. Option D is not a proper solution as plumber's tape won't effectively address the inherent problems with saddle valves. \n\nInstalling a T-fitting is a more permanent and reliable solution, though it may require more effort and potentially professional assistance, especially if working with galvanized pipes. This option provides better long-term performance and reduces the likelihood of future leaks or failures."}}
