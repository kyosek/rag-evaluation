It is fed from a 100A breaker using 3\\-3\\-3\\-5 CU Service wire. I removed the ground screw to isolate the Neutral and I installed the ground bus that came with it on the left side. It is attached with 2 screws directly to the panel. I connected the \\#5 ground wire to this ground bus.\n\nThe question:\nThe ground bus is SHORT with only 8\\-10 usable positions so I have added an additional ground bus on the right side of the panel. It is made specifically for the panel, Square D and attaches with 1 screw, centered over 2 nubs that lock it in place. Is the screw enough to ground this additional bar or do I need to interconnect it to the first ground bus with wire. If so, what size?\n\nThanks VERY much in advance for your assistance!\n\n**Follow up:**\n\nINSTRUCTIONS!! Those would VERY handy indeed. The problem is that they SUCK. Number 4 gives all the info about how to wire it, but I found it less than useful. Here is the entire text of the instructions:\n\n1\\) Turn off all power to the enclosure\n\n2\\) Mount grounding bar to the back of enclosure:\n\n* if one mounting hole and two nubs are provided, mount with outer holes over nubs and mounting screw through center hole.\n* if two mounting holes are provided, mount with two mounting screws.\n\nNOTE: If no mounting holes are provided, use \\#26 drill bit to drill two 0\\.147 in diameter mounting holes using grounding bar as a template.\n\n3\\) Apply equipment grounding label to enclosure beside grounding bar.\n\n4\\) **Install wiring to grounding bar.** See equipment grounding label for binding screw torque.\n\nSo are they assuming this is the ONLY grounding bar and therefore the \\#5 ground feed from the main panel will get attached to it? Or is the lack of instruction to jumper it to an existing main ground bar an indication that the screws are enough and that it grounds through the body of the enclosure to the original ground bar? I sure can't tell from what little info they provided.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Follow the instructions.** You are obliged (NEC 110\\.3\\) to follow the extra grounding bar's instructions. That's because those instructions are the basis for UL granting it a *listing* as safe. \n\nAs long as you met the instructions, **feel free to exceed**. So you can add a ground wire even if it's not required. Generally you don't downsize a service wire (i.e. you wouldn't run 14AWG to the last single 5\\-15 receptacle of a 20A circuit), so you'd stay with 5AWG Cu ground wire. \n\nAny type is fine, as long as it meets the original current rating. So don't pay for 2' of 3\\-3\\-3\\-5 just to obtain 2' of \\#5, use \\#5 or \\#4 THHN instead if it's cheaper."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: When installing an additional ground bus in a sub panel, which of the following is the most appropriate course of action according to electrical codes and best practices?\n\nA) Always interconnect the new ground bus to the existing one with a #5 copper wire, regardless of the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nB) Follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly, and only add additional grounding measures if explicitly stated in the instructions.\n\nC) Install the new ground bus using only the provided mounting hardware, assuming it will ground through the body of the enclosure.\n\nD) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation, but feel free to exceed them by adding an additional ground wire if desired.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation, as required by NEC 110.3, since these instructions are the basis for the product's UL listing. However, it's permissible and often advisable to exceed these instructions by adding additional safety measures, such as an interconnecting ground wire, as long as the original instructions are still followed. This approach ensures compliance with code requirements while allowing for enhanced safety. Options A and B are too restrictive, while C may not provide adequate grounding in all situations."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/08/04", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/159503", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/5146/"], "docs_id": 159503, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently upgraded versions of [pylint](http://www.logilab.org/card/pylint_manual), a popular Python style\\-checker.\n\nIt has gone ballistic throughout my code, pointing out places where I import modules in the same package, without specifying the full package path.\n\nThe new error message is W0403\\.\n\n> W0403: Relative import %r, should be %r\n> \n> \n> Used when an import relative to the package directory is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, if my packages are structured like this:\n\n```\n/cake\n  /__init__.py\n  /icing.py\n  /sponge.py\n/drink\n\n```\n\nand in the sponge package I write:\n\n```\nimport icing\n\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```\nimport cake.icing\n\n```\n\nI will get this error.\n\n---\n\nWhile I understand that not all Pylint messages are of equal importance, and I am not afraid to dismiss them, I don't understand why such a practice is considered a poor idea.\n\nI was hoping someone could explain the pitfalls, so I could improve my coding style rather than (as I currently plan to do) turning off this apparently spurious warning.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem of `import icing` is that you don't know whether it's an absolute import or a relative import. `icing` could be a module in python's path, or a package in the current module. This is quite annoying when a local package has the same name as a python standard library package.\n\nYou can do `from __future__ import absolute_import` which turns off implicit relative imports altogether. It is described, including with this justification about ambiguity, in [PEP 328](http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.5.html#pep-328). I believe Python 3 has implicit relative imports turned off completely.\n\nYou still can do relative imports, but you have to do them explicitly, like this:\n\n```\nfrom . import icing\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Python, what is the primary reason for avoiding implicit relative imports and using explicit relative or absolute imports instead?\n\nA) It improves code execution speed\nB) It reduces the risk of circular imports\nC) It eliminates ambiguity in import statements\nD) It allows for better code organization\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary reason for avoiding implicit relative imports is that they can lead to ambiguity. As explained in the documentation, when you use a statement like \"import icing\" within a package, it's unclear whether you're referring to a module in the current package or an external module with the same name in the Python path. This ambiguity can cause confusion and potential errors, especially when a local package has the same name as a Python standard library package.\n\nExplicit relative imports (e.g., \"from . import icing\") or absolute imports (e.g., \"import cake.icing\") clearly indicate the source of the imported module, eliminating this ambiguity. This practice is recommended in PEP 328 and is the default behavior in Python 3, where implicit relative imports are turned off completely.\n\nWhile the other options may have some benefits, they are not the primary reason for this coding practice. Improved execution speed (A) is not a significant factor. Reducing circular imports (B) is a separate issue. Better code organization (D) might be a side benefit but is not the main reason for avoiding implicit relative imports."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/95186", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/20829/"], "docs_id": 95186, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let the pair $( S, d \\\\, )$ be a metric space, i.e.  \n\n$d\\\\!: S^2 \\\\rightarrow R$, where for any three distinct elements $k$, $p$, $q$ $\\\\in S$:  \n\n$d\\[ \\\\, p, q \\\\, ] \\= d\\[ \\\\, q, p \\\\, ] \\> 0$,  \n\n$d\\[ \\\\, p, q \\\\, ] \\+ d\\[ \\\\, q, k \\\\, ] \\\\geq d\\[ \\\\, p, k \\\\, ]$, and  \n\n$d\\[ \\\\, p, p \\\\, ] \\= 0$. \n\nMy question concerns a (any) set $X$, and \n\na (any) map $x\\\\!: S^2 \\\\rightarrow X$  \n\nwhich satisfies that there exists an element $z\\_{X}$ $\\\\in X$ such that  \n\nfor each element $p$ $\\\\in S$: $ x\\[ \\\\, p, p \\\\, ] \\= z\\_{X} $ and  \n\nfor any two distinct elements $p$, $q$ $\\\\in S$: $ x\\[ \\\\, p, q \\\\, ] \\\\ne z\\_{X} $, and \n\na map $r\\_d\\\\!: (X \\\\verb\\|\\\\\\| z\\_{X})^2 \\\\rightarrow R$ which is defined such that  \n\nfor any two not necessarily distinct elements $a$, $b$ $\\\\in (X \\\\verb\\|\\\\\\| z\\_{X})$  \n\nand for any four not necessarily all distinct elements $j$, $k$, $p$, $q$ $\\\\in S$ such that  \n\n$ x\\[ \\\\, j, k \\\\, ] \\= a $ and $ x\\[ \\\\, p, q \\\\, ] \\= b $  \n\nthe values of map $r\\_d$ are defined as\n$ r\\_d\\[ \\\\, a, b \\\\, ] :\\= d\\[ \\\\, j, k \\\\, ] / d\\[ \\\\, p, q \\\\, ] $.\n\nNote that the pair $( S, x \\\\, )$ is not necessarily a metric space since set $X$ is not necessarily the set of real numbers, $R$; nor necessarily some subset of $R$.\n\nI'd like to know:  \n\nHow do you call such a set $X$, or such maps $x$ or $r\\_d$, in general, please?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not certain that all of the conditions you mention in your \"definition\" are satisfied in this setting, but I think you should look at $\\\\Gamma$\\-Ultrametric spaces, c.f.

This is happening because in the onStop() method, the camera object is being released:\n\n```java\n@Override\nprotected onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    if (camera != null) {\n        camera.release();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, there's no corresponding code to re-initialize the camera when the app resumes. When the user tries to use the flashlight after resuming the app, it's attempting to use the released camera object, causing the crash.\n\nTo fix this, you would need to add onPause() and onResume() methods to properly handle the camera object's lifecycle. In onPause(), you should release the camera, and in onResume(), you should re-initialize it. This ensures that the camera resource is properly managed when the app goes to the background and comes back to the foreground."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/15", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/348789", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/123001/"], "docs_id": 348789, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have inherited a latex stylesheet and document, in it, the bibliography seems to detect when there are multiple works in a row, with the same author, when this occurs it replaces the author with a line, i.e:\n\n> Crisp, Oliver.

From the given information:\n\np(1-q) = 0.2\n(1-p)q = 0.3\n\nThis leads to q - p = 0.1 and p(0.9 - p) = 0.2, which is a quadratic equation in p. This quadratic equation has two solutions, confirming that there are two possible sets of values for P(A) and P(B).\n\nTo find P(A \u222a B), we use:\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n          = p + q - pq\n          = p + (p + 0.1) - p(p + 0.1)\n          = 2p + 0.1 - p^2 - 0.1p\n          = 0.1 + 1.9p - p^2\n\nSolving the quadratic p(0.9 - p) = 0.2 gives p \u2248 0.2764 or p \u2248 0.6236. Both these values, when substituted into the expression for P(A \u222a B), yield approximately 0.7.\n\nTherefore, P(A \u222a B) = 0.7 and there are two possible solutions for P(A) and P(B), making option C the correct answer."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/22", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/356077", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/264141/"], "docs_id": 356077, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When testing, sometimes a helper method can be useful for repeated task e.g. in test setup. \n\n*Concrete example*:\nWe have certain tests against our rest interface using Spring's `RestTemplate`.

In reality virtually no data is ever a perfect normal distribution, although we can discuss \u201capproximately normal distributions\u201d such as height, weight, temperature, or length of adult ring finger in large population groups.\n\n**Professor's answer:**\n\n> You are correct that there is no perfectly normal distribution. But, we are not looking for perfection. We need to look at data in addition to the histogram and the measures of central tendency. What do the skewness and kurtosis statistics tell you about the distribution? Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A problem with your discussion with the professor is one of terminology, there's a misunderstanding that is getting in the way of conveying a potentially useful idea. In different places, you both make errors.\n\nSo the first thing to address: it's important to be pretty clear about what a [*distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is.\n\nA normal *distribution* is a specific mathematical object, which you could consider as a model for a process (which you might consider an uncountably infinite population of values; no finite population can actually have a continuous distribution).\n\nLoosely, what this distribution does (once you specify the parameters) is define (via an algebraic expression) the proportion of the population values that lies within any given interval on the real line. Slightly less loosely, it defines the probability that a single value from that population will lie in any given interval.\n\nAn observed sample doesn't really have a normal distribution; a sample might (potentially) be drawn from a normal distribution, if one were to exist. If you look at the empirical cdf of the sample, it's discrete. If you bin it (as in a histogram) the sample has a \"frequency distribution\", but those aren't normal distributions. The distribution can tell us some things (in a probabilistic sense) about a random sample from the population, and a sample may also tell us some things about the population.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of a phrase like \"normally distributed sample\"\\* is \"a random sample from a normally distributed population\".\n\n\\*(I generally try to avoid saying it myself, for reasons that are hopefully made clear enough here; usually I manage to confine myself to the second kind of expression.)\n\nHaving defined terms (if still a little loosely), let us now look at the question in detail. I'll be addressing specific pieces of the question.\n\n> normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode\n\nThis is certainly a condition on the normal probability distribution, though not a requirement on a sample drawn from a normal distribution; samples may be asymmetric, may have mean differ from median and so on. \\[We can, however, get an idea how far apart we might reasonably expect them to be if the sample really came from a normal population.]\n\n> all the data must be contained under the bell curve\n\nI am not sure what \"contained under\" means in this sense.\n\n> and perfectly symmetrical around the mean.\n\nNo; you're talking about the *data* here, and a sample from a (definitely symmetrical) normal population would not itself be perfectly symmetric.\n\nHere's some simulated samples from normal distributions:\n\n[![Histograms of 9 samples of size 60 from a normal distribution with population mean 50 and population  standard deviation 5](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)\n\nIf you generate a number of samples of about that sample size (60\\) and plot histograms with about 10 bins, you may see similar variation in general shape.\n\nAs you can see from the histograms, these are not actually symmetric. Some, like 2, 4 and 7, are quite distinctly *asymmetrical*. Some have quite short tails, like 5 and 8, some have noticeably longer tails, at least on one side. Some suggest multiple modes. None actually look all that close to what an actual normal density looks like $\\-$ that is, even random samples don't necessarily look all that much like their populations, at least not until the sample sizes are fairly large $\\-$ considerably larger than the n\\=60 I used here.\n\n> Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies,\n\nI [agree with your conclusion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204471/is-there-an-explanation-for-why-there-are-so-many-natural-phenomena-that-follow/204479#204479) but the reasoning is not correct; it's not a consequence of the fact that *data* are not perfectly symmetric (etc); it's the fact that *populations* are themselves not [perfectly normal](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57407/what-is-the-meaning-of-all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful).\n\n> if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution\n\nIf she said this in just that way, she's definitely wrong.\n\nA sample skewness may be much closer to 0 than that (taking \"less than\" to mean in absolute magnitude not actual value), and the sample excess kurtosis may also be much closer to 0 than that (they might even, whether by chance or construction, potentially be almost exactly zero), and yet the distribution from which the sample was drawn might be distinctly non\\-normal (e.g. bimodal, or clearly asymmetric, or perhaps with somewhat heavier tails than the normal $\\-$ it's not *just* the tail that determines kurtosis)\n\nWe can go further \\-\\- even if we were to magically know the *population* skewness and kurtosis were exactly that of a normal, it still wouldn't of itself tell us the population was normal, nor even something close to normal.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[![double gamma, shape parameter 2.302776](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)\n\nThis particular example is strongly bimodal, heavier tailed than the normal, but symmetric. It has the same skewness and kurtosis as the normal.\n\nFurther examples can be found in [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/154965/805) answer.\n\nNot all are symmetric, and some are discrete.\n\n> The dataset is total number of falls/year in a random sampling of 52 nursing homes which is a random sample of a larger population.\n\nThe population distribution of counts are *never* normal. Counts are discrete and non\\-negative, normal distributions are continuous and over the entire real line.\n\nBut we're really focused on the wrong issue here. Probability models are just that, *models*. Let us not [confuse our models with the real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology)).\n\nThe issue isn't \"are the *data themselves* normal?\" (they can't be), nor even \"is the population from which the data were drawn normal?\" (this is almost never going to be the case).\n\nA more useful question to discuss is \"how badly would my inference be impacted if I treated the population as normally distributed?\"\n\nThat is we should not be overly focused on whether the assumption is *true* (we shouldn't expect that), but whether it's useful, or perhaps what and how severe might the consequences be if we were to use such a model.\n\nIt's also a much harder question to answer well, and may require considerably more work than glancing at a few simple diagnostics.\n\nThe sample statistics you showed are not particularly inconsistent with normality (you could see statistics like that or \"worse\" not terribly rarely if you had random samples of that size from normal populations), but that doesn't of itself mean that the actual population from which the sample was drawn is automatically \"close enough\" to normal for some particular purpose. It would be important to consider the purpose (what questions you're answering), and the robustness of the methods employed for it, and even then we may still not be sure that it's \"good enough\"; sometimes it may be better to simply not assume what we don't have good reason to assume *a priori* (e.g. on the basis of experience with similar data sets).\n\n> it is NOT a normal distribution\n\nData \\- even data drawn from a normal population \\- never have exactly the properties of the population; from those numbers alone you don't have a good basis to conclude that the population is not normal here.\n\nOn the other hand neither do we have any reasonably solid basis to say that it's \"sufficiently close\" to normal \\- we haven't even considered the purpose of assuming normality, so we don't know what distributional features it might be sensitive to.\n\nFor example, if I had two samples for a measurement that was bounded, that I knew would not be heavily discrete (not mostly only taking a few distinct values) and reasonably near to symmetric, I might be relatively happy to use a two\\-sample t\\-test at some not\\-so\\-small sample size; it's moderately robust to mild deviations from the assumptions (somewhat level\\-robust, somewhat less power\\-robust). But I would be considerably more cautious about as causally assuming normality when testing equality of spread, for example, because the best test under that assumption is quite sensitive to the assumption.\n\n> Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\"\n\nIf that's really the criterion by which one decides to use a normal distributional model, then it will sometimes lead you into quite poor analyses.\n\nThe values of those statistics do give us some clues about the population from which the sample was drawn, but that's not at all the same thing as suggesting that their values are in any way a 'safe guide' to choosing an analysis.\n\nCast your mind back to the fact that there's distributional examples where the population has very different shape from the normal, but with the same *population* skewness and kurtosis. Add to that the inherent noise in their sample equivalents (and not least of all, the considerable downbias typical of sample kurtosis), and you may well be concluding rather too much on very limited and possibly misleading evidence.\n\n---\n\nNow to address the underlying issue with even a better phrased version of such a question as the one you had:\n\nThe whole process of looking at a sample to choose a model is fraught with problems \\-\\- doing so alters the properties of any subsequent choices of analysis based on what you saw! e.g for a hypothesis test, your significance levels, p\\-values and power are all *not what you would choose/calculate them to be*, because those calculations are predicated on the analysis not being based on the data.\n\nSee, for example Gelman and Loken (2014\\), \"[The Statistical Crisis in Science](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science),\" *American Scientist*, Volume 102, Number 6, p 460\n(DOI: 10\\.1511/2014\\.111\\.460\\) which discusses issues with such data\\-dependent analysis."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A researcher collects data on the number of falls per year in 52 nursing homes.

Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The data is definitely normally distributed because the skewness and kurtosis are between -1 and +1.\n\nB) The data cannot be normally distributed because it represents count data, which is discrete and non-negative.\n\nC) The data is not normally distributed because the mean and median are not exactly equal.\n\nD) The sample statistics alone are insufficient to conclusively determine if the population distribution is normal, and the appropriateness of assuming normality depends on the specific analysis and its robustness to deviations from normality.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement. While the sample statistics don't show strong evidence against normality, they also don't prove the population is normally distributed. Count data can't truly follow a normal distribution, but it may be approximately normal in some cases. The appropriateness of assuming normality depends on the specific analysis being performed and how sensitive it is to deviations from normality. Options A, B, and C all make overly strong claims based on limited information.

Unfortunately, different authors define uniform integrability differently, which causes quite a lot of confusion, as evident in the number of questions about uniform integrability and Vitali convergence theorem in [MSE](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?q=uniform+integrability+vitali+convergence+theorem). However, after reading many of those questions and the answers, I feel that many students are still confused. In this post, I want to clear all the confusion once and for all.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nThroughout this post, I would use the following definitions.\n\nLet $(X, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\\\Phi$ a collection of measurable functions on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$, taking values in the extended real line.\n\n1. We say $\\\\Phi$ is **uniformly bounded in $L^1$** if\n$$ \\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_X \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\infty $$\n2. We say $\\\\Phi$ **does not escape to vertical infinity** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $M \\> 0$ such that\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{\\|f\\| \\\\geq M} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n3.

Measure theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as being equi\\-integrable.\n2. Probability theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as not escaping to vertical infinity.\n3. In [Tao's blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/245a-notes-4-modes-of-convergence/), uniform integrability was defined as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$, not escaping to vertical infinity and not escaping to width infinity.\n4. Yet some other authors define uniform integrability as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$ and equi\\-integrable.\n\nWhat adds to more confusion is, the different definitions of uniform integrability are only equivalent under certain assumptions, while in general they are not equivalent.

Ann Corio claims that the term was originated by early striptease artist Carrie Finnell. Presumably, when she tossed the apparatus on her dressing table one night it fell in the shape of a \"G.\" *see* CHICAGO G\\-STRING \\[the entry for which reads \"An especially revealing type of G\\-string used by strippers which is sewn to an elastic band in a manner that allows \"the bauble to fly\" and reveal pudendum underneath.\"]\n\nFrom Robert Chapman, *New Dictionary of American Slang* (1986\\):\n\n> **gee string** or **G\\-string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** *fr middle 1800s* A breech\\-cloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn especially by striptease dancers: *Thus the* G\\-string *became an integral part of a stripper's apparatus* \u2014Toronto Life {origin unknown}\n\nFrom Barbara Kipfer \\& Robert Chapman, *Dictionary of American Slang*, fourth edition (2005\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** or **gee string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** A breechcloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn esp by striptease dancers \\[citation omitted] {1878\\+; origin unknown; the dated use refers to Plains Indian use of a loincloth; the stripper sense is found in the 1930s}\n\nFrom Robert Hendrickson, *The QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins*, fourth edition (2008\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** Stripteasers, who sometimes call this a \"gadget,\" aren't responsible for the word. *G\\-string* is an Americanism first used to describe an Indian's loin cloth or breechclout in the 19th century. It could be that some fiddler in the West compared the heaviest of violin strings, the G string, to the length of sinew or gut the Indians tied around their waists to hold up their breechclouts. But even the heavies of violin strings wouldn't really do the job. Perhaps the g i is just a euphemistic shortening of \"groin,\" an indecent word at the time. The burlesque G\\-string is of course far smaller than the Indian variety and must have seemed even skimpier a century ago, considering the Brunhildean builds of yesterday's ecdysiasts. One burlesque company of the day proudly advertised \"two tons of women\" and had only 20 strippers.\n\nSo your question about the origin of *G\\-string* might actually be separated into three distinct questions: (1\\) why did U.S. settlers on the Great Plains in the 1870s call the rawhide band used to hold a Native American's loincloth in place a \"geestring\"? (2\\) why did U.S. dance\\-art enthusiasts call the genital covering used by striptease artists a *G\\-string*? (3\\) what connection is there between the nineteenth\\-century \"gee string\" and the 1930s\u2013present \"G\\-string\"?\n\nI will run some database searches into those questions and add to this answer if I find anything interesting.\n\n---\n\n***On the transition from 'geestring' to G\\-string'***\n\nWith regard to the question of the connection between *geestring* and *G\\-string*, it is noteworthy that *G string* appears as early as 1881 as spelling variant for *geestring*. From \"[Society Report](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021913/1881-07-16/ed-1/seq-2/#words=%22a+G+string%22+%22a+g+string%22+%22a+g+string%22),\" in the *\\[Globe City] Arizona Silver Belt* (July 16, 1881\\):\n\n> Mrs. Natch\\-il\\-a\\-tilly was magnificently attired with a **g string** around her waist with some suggestions of faded magnificence suspended therefrom.\n\nAs for the transition between *geestring* as a breechclout and **G\\-string** as striptease accoutrement, a newspaper instance of \"gee string\" from 1921 may provide a missing link. From \"[Fringe Sewed on Beach Queens Who Lack Conscience](https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=CJ19210820.2.8&txq=%2522gee+string%2522),\" in the *\\[Coronado, California] Strand* (August 20, 1921\\):\n\n> Chicago.\u2014Censors at the bathing beaches in Chicago, just now densely populated with gay crowds have solved the problem of dealing with girls who are a trifle shy on clothes.

To solve it:\n\n1) First, note that (0,0) is a trivial solution.\n\n2) The left side of the equation, x^2 + xy + y^2, is the norm form in the ring of Eisenstein integers. This suggests that other solutions, if they exist, might have some symmetry.\n\n3) By expanding the right side and comparing terms, we can deduce that any non-zero solution must satisfy x + y = 3 or x + y = -3.\n\n4) Substituting these into the original equation and solving, we find that (3,-3) is indeed a solution when x + y = 3, and (-3,3) when x + y = -3.\n\n5) However, (-3,3) is just the negative of (3,-3), and in Diophantine equations, we typically consider these as equivalent solutions.\n\nTherefore, the equation has exactly two distinct integer solutions: (0,0) and (3,-3). This matches option B.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because:\nA) While the solutions do form a line, there are not infinitely many integer solutions.\nC) There is at least one non-zero solution.\nD) (-3,3) is not considered a distinct solution from (3,-3) in this context."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/11", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/594331", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/170331/"], "docs_id": 594331, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using Skype for Linux (version 4\\.2\\.0\\.11\\) and I can't access with my merged Microsoft account.  \n\nWhen I insert my login info I get an error message, *\"Sorry, something went wrong.

And add the following to your di, file this class stops configurable products getting the correct add to cart.\n\n```xml\n<type name=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Model\\Product\\Type\\Configurable\">\n        <plugin name=\"remove_possible_by_from_list\" type=\"GremlinTech\\CategoryConfigurable\\Plugin\\Configurable\" sortOrder=\"1\"  disabled=\"false\"/>\n\n</type>\n\n```\n\nThen create a custom php class Under Plugin called configurable\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace GremlinTech\\CategoryConfigurable\\Plugin;\n\nclass Configurable\n{\n\n    public function afterIsPossibleBuyFromList(\\Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Model\\Product\\Type\\Configurable $subject, $result)\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNext step is to overwrite the Magento\\_Catalog::templates/list.phtml and add the following under the hidden input fields that are already there.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"selected_configurable_option\" value=\"\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"related_product\" id=\"related-products-field\" value=\"\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item\"  value=\"<?= /* @noEscape */ $postParams['data']['product'] ?>\" />\n\n```\n\nAlso you need to modify the form element itself to look like below\n\n```html\n      <form data-role=\"tocart-form\"\n                      id=\"product_addtocart_form-<?=$_product->getId(); ?>\"\n                      data-product-sku=\"<?= $block->escapeHtml($_product->getSku()) ?>\"\n                      action=\"<?= $block->getAddToCartUrl($_product) ?>\"\n                      <?php if ($_product->getOptions()) :?> enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"<?php endif; ?>\n                      method=\"post\">\n\n```\n\nNow your list view has its actual fields, you need to add a catalog\\_category\\_view.xml layout either in the theme or in the module created above, and add the following. This will call the product view configurable template into your list.\n\n```xml\n  <referenceBlock name=\"category.products.list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n</referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nYou will need to do the same for catalogsearch\\_result\\_index.xml as the xml is different for search results though uses the same catalog list template\n\n```xml\n <referenceBlock name=\"search_result_list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n </referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nNow we have this you need to overide the Magento\\_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml template again in the theme or module, you then need to make it look like the below.\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

I can figure out the centre of Normal Reaction but not how it's distributed over the surface.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to consider the elastic properties of the contact to determine the distribution of forces. Actually, it is the distribution of pressure you are interested, since you sum up the pressures to get force, and sum of the moment of pressure to get torque. Imagine a contact area with the center is on the contact point, the *z*\\-axis normal to the contact, and the *xy* plane along the contact.\n\n$$ \\\\begin{aligned}\n F\\_z \\& \\= \\\\int P(x,y) \\\\, {\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_x \\& \\= \\\\int (\\-y) P(x,y) \\\\,{\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_y \\& \\= \\\\int (\\+x) P(x,y)\\\\, {\\\\rm d} A\n\\\\end{aligned} $$\n\nSo given a pressure distribution $P(x,y)$ you can find the forces, but how to get the pressure distribution? \n\nThe most basic example is an object pushing on a flat plane. Consider the case where there is a known overlap amount $a(x,y)$ as a function of location on the contact\n\n![overlap](https://i.imgur.com/FDcm2Lc.png)\n\nAs a result, the surface of the object (red curve) must deform by $\\\\delta(x,y)$ in order to conform to the overlap. Surface pressure (yellow curve) must be applied to the object to do this\n\n![pressure](https://i.imgur.com/BQHR15q.png)\n\nThe pressure deflection relationship was developed by [Boussinesq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Point_contact_on_a_(3D)_half-space) and it looks like this\n\n$$ \\\\delta(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{1\\-\\\\nu^2}{\\\\pi E} \\\\iint \\\\frac{P(u,v)}{r} {\\\\rm d} A $$ \n\nwhere $r\\=\\\\sqrt{(x\\-u)^2\\+(y\\-v)^2}$ and $\\\\nu$ is the [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio) of the material and $E$ is the [Elastic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus).\n\nA special case for the above is the [Hertzian contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Classical_solutions_for_non-adhesive_elastic_contact) which deals with a sphere on a plane, sphere on a sphere, cylinder on a cylinder (2D contact) and general football shape (two radii) contact.\n\nThe general case can only be treated numerically with the contact are divided into a grid and a giant system of equations is developed of the form $\\\\delta\\_i \\= C\\_{i j} P\\_j$ (Hartnett solution).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Assume a certain amount of overlap $a(x,y)$ derived from the maximum penetration amount.\n2. Set the deflections equal to the overlap, and solve for the pressures $P(x,y)$.\n3. Calculate the total load and moments, and adjust the overlap accordingly. If the total load is less than the applied load then increase the overlap, and if the total moment is less than the applied torque then tilt the object\n4. If the forces and moments are still imbalanced, then go to step 2 and repeat until convergence has been achieved.\n\n---\n\nSee [this detailed paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768309003047) for one example on numerical contact analysis.

Quantum GIS, with a powerful collection of tool and an easy\\-to\\-use interface, is particularly popular on this site, and you will be able to find plenty of help for any questions you may have about it.\n\nIf you need something for web mapping, [another post has a basic introduction](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/8113/steps-to-start-web-mapping), including a list of FOSS tools.\n\nIf you need to perform these tasks programmatically, look into [GDAL and OGR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdal), two libraries for manipulating geospatial data.\n\nSo, nearly any GIS can do those tasks easily. Now we'll just need to know the details. In particular, what format are your map and database? Geospatial data is typically either *vector*, with lines, points, and polygons, or *raster*, with a grid of cells. Any of the above GIS tools can handle both, but the process will be different for each type."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A geography student needs to create a digital map for their thesis project.

It's a free and open-source desktop GIS package that provides an easy-to-use interface for both beginners and advanced users.

However, I don't see how the result follows without using something fancy. Is there an obvious or nice proof I'm missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 7 years ago I wrote in an unfinished paper a proof of this result; I didn't know then if it was original but it indeed seems to be known to a number of specialists although I'm not aware of a written complete proof. Since I don't want anymore to complete this paper, I reproduce the proof here (not self\\-contained, relying on \\[LW] below) as Proposition 5; possibly Uri has a more direct approach. I include closely related Proposition 1, which was my original goal.\n\n**Proposition 1**\n*Let $G$ be a compact group (not necessarily Lie). Consider the action by $G$ by conjugation on $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ (the space of subgroups of $G$, endowed with the Chabauty topology). Then the orbits of $G\\_0$ (connected component of 1\\) coincide with the connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$.*\n\nAs a corollary, for $G$ a compact group, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if $G\\_0$ is central in $G$ (equivalently, $G/Z(G)$ is totally disconnected), a result obtained in \\[FG]. More generally, it can be checked that for an arbitrary locally compact group $G$, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if either totally disconnected, or $G$ is pointwise elliptic with $G\\_0$ central. ($G$ pointwise elliptic means that every single element generates a cyclic subgroup with compact closure.)\n\n**Lemma 2**\n*Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $F$ be a finite group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $F\\\\to G$.*\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)$ can be described as a real algebraic variety, so has finitely many components. By \\[LW], all homomorphisms in a given component are conjugate under $G\\_0$.\n\\\\end{proof}\n\n**Lemma 3**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $S$ be a connected compact semisimple Lie group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $S\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(S,G)$ is canonically identified with the space of Lie algebra homomorphisms $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}$, which is an algebraic variety as well, so has finitely many connected components. So we can again use \\[LW].\n\n**Lemma 4**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $D$ be a connected compact abelian Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $D\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nAny such homomorphism maps into a maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate \\[Bourbaki, Groupes et Alg\u00e8bres de Lie, Chap 9, \u00a72\\.2]. This reduces to the case when $G$ is a torus, but then the result just follows from the fact that $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^a,(\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^b)\\\\simeq\\\\mathbf{Z}^{ab}$, which is countable.\n\n**Lemma 5**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed connected subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nSince there are finitely many isomorphism types of compact semisimple groups in a given dimension, we can fix this type, so by Lemma 3, it is enough to consider the set of closed connected subgroups whose semisimple part is a given subgroup $S$. Therefore, it is enough to count conjugacy classes of closed abelian connected subgroups in $N(S)/S$, where $N(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the normalizer, and Lemma 4 applies. \n\n**Proposition 6**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nBy Lemma 5, we can consider those subgroups for which $H\\_0\\=L$ is given. So it is enough to count conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $N(L)/L$, there are countably many because of Lemma 2\\.\n\n*Proof of Proposition 1*\nWe begin with the case when $G$ is a Lie group. Since $G\\_0$ has finite index in $G$, Proposition 6 implies that there are countably many $G\\_0$\\-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Clearly, it is invariant under conjugation by $G\\_0$. We just obtained that the quotient of $C$ by the action of $G\\_0$ is countable. It is also a compact connected Hausdorff space, so is reduced to a point (it is Hausdorff because the acting group is compact, see \\[Bourbaki, Topologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, III, \u00a74\\.1]. This means that $G\\_0$ acts transitively on each connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$, and we are done.\n\nNow let us deal with a general compact group $G$. (It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is countable). We write $G$ as a projective limit of compact Lie groups $G/K\\_i$. Clearly, if two elements $H,H'$ of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ are conjugate under $G\\_0$, then they lie in the same component. Conversely, suppose they belong to the same connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Then since $K\\_i$ is compact, the projection map $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{S}(G/K\\_i)$ is continuous. Because of the case of Lie groups, there exists $g\\_i\\\\in G\\_0$ such that $(g\\_iHg\\_i^{\\-1}K\\_i\\=H'K\\_i)$ (we use the fact that the inverse image of the unit component of $G/K\\_i$ is the unit component of $G$). Let $g$ be a limit point of $(g\\_i)$. If $h\\\\in H$, then $g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}$ can be written as $h'\\_ik\\_i$ with $h'\\_i\\\\in H'$ and $k\\_i\\\\in K\\_i$. Necessarily $k\\_i\\\\to 1$, so $h'\\_i\\=g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}k\\_i^{\\-1}$ also converges, necessarily to an element $h'$ of $H'$. We have $ghg^{\\-1}\\=h'$. This proves that $gHg^{\\-1}\\\\subset H'$, and the converse inclusion $g^{\\-1}H'g\\\\subset H'$ is strictly similar.\n\n\\[FG] S. Fisher, P. Gartside.

What are the 'red flags' you've come across (performance hogs, security risks, architectural bad practices)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here are some thoughts on evaluating 3rd Party Modules:\n\n**Basics:**\n\n* Current Magento Version Support \\- Does it support the latest version of Magento (including the current one we are developing it for)?\n\nIf a module does not support the latest release of Magento, it will probably be difficult to make it work without spending precious development time on it.\n* Support \\- Do the developers who created the module support the product?\n\nOne of the signs of a healthy module is that the developers actively support it. If they don't support it is a red flag, why won't they support the product if it's good? \n\nAdditionally, when a module is supported, we can usually get important info from the developers with a simple email (for example, does this module use jQuery or Prototype).\n* Reviews \\- What are other users saying? How was their experience?\n\nBy reading the reviews we can get a better sense of the big picture, is there a installation issue? Do the developers respond in a timely and helpful manner? Does it work as advertised?\n* Refund \\- Will they give you back your money if it doesn't work out as intended?\n\nMany times we want to try out the module so that we can test it, if it works and meets our specifications great! But if it doesn't, we want the option of returning it and getting a refund for it.\n\n**Intermediate:**\n\n* Class Overrides \\- Does the module override any core classes?\n\nGenerally speaking a good module should not override any core classes, rather it should use Observers.\n\nOne reason for this, is that it can make upgrading Magento difficult. Additionally, other modules might be depending on one output from a given function, and this module is providing a different one.\n\nSometimes this is not possible to do, if this is the case, there should be a very good reason why it is overriding a core class.\n* Layout updates \\- Does the module change some of my layout settings?\n\nSome modules change the layout settings to your site (for example: product page), make sure it doesn't break your current layout, and if it does what would be required (read: how much time will it take us) to fix it.\n* Template changes \\- Does the module include templates that change my current design?\n\nWill this module introduce new templates? If yes, will they break my design? How much time will it take to have the design the way we want?\n* Dependencies \\- Does the module depend on any other module?\n\nIf the module depends on others, we need to make sure they are there and installed. Additionally we need to ask ourselves, are we going to want to turn off the module it depends on in the future?\n\n**Advanced:**\n\n* SQL Upgrade scripts \\- Does the module update the DB in some way?\n\nOnce a module updates the database we need to make sure of a few things.\n\nDoes it update a core table? If yes, that's not good, we like our databases clean and ready for upgrade.\n\nDoes it store the information in a sensible way? If we want to get the data raw from the database ourselves, would we be able to make sense of it?\n* Events \\- Does the module observe or dispatch any events?\n\nIf a module dispatches or observes events, we want to know:\n\nWhich events is it observing / dispatching? Will this affect another module working in the system. For example, if one of our modules changes the name of our products on\\-load to uppercase, and this module adds the word 'free' to the name of the product on\\-load, how will it work? Will the word 'free' also come out upper cased?\n* Code Review \\- Does the module use acceptable coding techniques?\n\nThis has more to do with PHP coding techniques than Magento.\n\nDoes the code use Try / Catch blocks?\n\nDoes the code escape user input?\n\nThe specifics of this really depend on our skill level / requirements.\n* Potential issues \\- What potential issues can come up as a result of installing this module?\n\nTry to imagine the top five problems that could come up if we install this module, surprising as it may be, it really gives insight in to the project as a whole.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nAll these things are nice to have in an ideal world, in real world scenarios we need to do this thing called 'compromise' :)\n\nAdditionally, these guidelines are meant to be as a help to us, not to hinder us, as a result if we are only installing one module, let's say a social sharing module, and it's for a client who needs a simple site setup, there is no sense in doing a ton of research.\n\nIn other words: It's all about being efficient with our time, if using this (item in the) guideline helps me save time in the long run use it, if not drop it and save your sanity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When evaluating a third-party Magento extension, which of the following is NOT considered a \"red flag\" or potential issue?\n\nA) The extension overrides core Magento classes instead of using Observers\nB) The extension updates core database tables directly\nC) The extension dispatches new custom events\nD) The extension doesn't support the latest version of Magento\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Overriding core Magento classes is generally considered a bad practice. The documentation states that \"a good module should not override any core classes, rather it should use Observers.\" This can make upgrading Magento difficult and may cause conflicts with other modules.\n\nB) Updating core database tables directly is risky. The documentation mentions that when a module updates the database, we need to ensure it doesn't update a core table, as \"we like our databases clean and ready for upgrade.\"\n\nC) Dispatching new custom events is not inherently a problem. While the documentation discusses observing and dispatching events, it focuses on understanding which events are being used and how they might interact with other modules. Creating new custom events can actually be a good way to extend functionality without modifying core code.\n\nD) Not supporting the latest version of Magento is indeed a red flag. The documentation explicitly states that if a module doesn't support the latest release, \"it will probably be difficult to make it work without spending precious development time on it.\"\n\nThe correct answer is C because dispatching new custom events is not inherently problematic and can be a good way to extend functionality, unlike the other options which are all considered potential issues or red flags when evaluating Magento extensions."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/09", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/5545", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/81/"], "docs_id": 5545, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are selling articles that should be sold cheaper if sold in specific multiplies (10 pieces, 20 pieces, ...).\n\nWhen setting a tier price, it is only possible to set this price for \"\\> 10\" items and 11 items would also get an discount.\n\nIs there an \"easy\" way to set this in the Magento backend or a simple approach for an own module?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think there is a builtin functionality to cover this.\n\nBut anyway a module shouldn't be that hard.\n\nThere are 2 events, `checkout_cart_product_add_after` and `checkout_cart_update_items_after`, observe both and inside the observer do something like:\n\n```\n$item = $observer->getItem();\nif (($item->getQty() % 10) == 0) {\n    $item->setCustomPrice($item->getPrice() * 0.9); // or whatever ;-)\n}\n\n```\n\nI would suggest this way to solve the problem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Magento developer needs to implement a custom pricing rule where articles are sold at a discounted price only when purchased in specific multiples (e.g., 10 pieces, 20 pieces, etc.).

Creating a custom module that observes specific checkout events allows for precise control over when and how the discount is applied, without modifying core Magento files. This approach is scalable, maintainable, and follows Magento development best practices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modifying core Magento files is strongly discouraged as it can lead to complications during updates and is not a sustainable development practice.\n\nOption C, while possible, would only affect the frontend display and not the actual price calculation, potentially leading to discrepancies between displayed and charged prices.\n\nOption D is not suitable because Magento's built-in promotional rules don't offer the granular control needed for this specific requirement of applying discounts only to exact multiples of a quantity."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/11", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/955532", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/39017/"], "docs_id": 955532, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've just installed Active Directory on my Windows 2012 R2 server and my Windows 8/10 machines connect perfectly, but Linux and OSX can't seem to connect.\n\nThe AD server's computer name is \"DC01\" and I used the following commands to install AD:\n\n> Install\\-WindowsFeature AD\\-Domain\\-Services \u2013IncludeManagementTools\n> \n> \n> Install\\-ADDSForest \\-DomainName \"ad.example.com\" \\-DomainNetbiosName \"example\" DomainMode Win2008R2 \\-ForestMode Win2008R2 \\-InstallDns\n\nIf I understand correctly, my active domain FQDN is **ad.example.com**.

The administrator mentions that the subdomain doesn't exist anywhere, which suggests that the DNS records for the Active Directory domain may not be correctly set up.

[*How can we improve our voting system?*](https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2784/how-can-we-improve-our-voting-system) touches on some of the concerns which were exemplified today in two ELL questions (votes at the moment of this writing are in parens):\n\n* [The ambiguous \"he is buried\"](https://ell.stackexchange.com/q/107449/37009) (4\\)\n* [When a girl mentions her girlfriend, does she mean it like lesbian girlfriend?](https://ell.stackexchange.com/q/107424/37009) (20\\)\n\nThe voting model serves SE very well, it seems to me, in most of the areas of interest served by its sites. In the case of ELL, though, our objective is supposed to be the creation of a database of useful Q's and A's on English, with the emphasis on material which benefits EFL students. It is surely helpful to a learner to understand that \"girlfriend\" does not always mean \"lover\", but it seems to me that an interesting question about voice and the copula is of wider use and benefit to such a student than a mildly provocative discussion of the reluctance of men to refer to their male friends as \"boyfriend.\" (Not to mention that the male repressed homosexuality evidenced by this reluctance is a better fit for cogsci.stackexchange.com than for ELL!)\n\nAs was pointed out in commentary, the second question above certainly has value to a learner, but its high popularity put me in mind of previous (and better) examples. The point here is not just the high vote count for the second, but the disparity between the two vote counts.\n\nIsn't there anything we can do to prevent the occasional elevation of questions whose popularity is based as much on their subject matter as on their value to the learner? For instance, can we provide moderators with some form of \"enhanced up/down vote\" which could be applied judiciously in such cases?\n\n(That is a seat\\-of\\-the\\-pants idea and may not pass muster, but this seems to me an important and obvious flaw in the \"popularity\" model that we could well consider addressing.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Isn't there anything we can do to prevent the occasional elevation of questions whose popularity is based as much on their subject matter as on their value to the learner? For instance, can we provide moderators with some form of \"enhanced up/down vote\" which could be applied judiciously in such cases?\n\nAs a practical matter, no, there isn\u2019t anything ELL can do along these lines. That kind of change would have to be applied to the entire Stack Exchange network\u2014and I can assure you that there are other SE sites would *not* welcome that change, no matter how much ELL thought it was a good idea. \n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not at all in keeping with the voting model that Stack Exchange is built upon, and doesn\u2019t mesh with the SE Theory of Moderation. Voting is a matter of prime importance on Stack Exchange, and is ultimately the most important way in which Stack Exchange sites are community\\-run. The job of moderators is primarily exception handling, either by handling flags or by raising community discussions on subjects that might not be apparent to those who aren\u2019t following questions the way moderators do.\n\nWhich is why the moderators aren\u2019t in any way empowered to influence voting above and beyond their status as community members. The final privilege with respect to voting, the downvote, is received at 125 reputation\u2014every member with that much reputation is intended to have equal voice in the voting process.

There is indeed no holomorphic function on \u03a9 whose real part is u, and this can be proven using the identity theorem. The proof involves considering a hypothetical holomorphic function f whose real part is u, then examining f(z) - log(z) on the slit annulus \u03a9 \\ (-R,-r). This function would have a real part of zero, making it equal to an imaginary constant.

The information provided indicates that German TTS voices for Festival do exist, but they are not as easily accessible as some other languages. The source mentions that there are \"several developments of german voices on top of festival,\" but these are primarily available through \"commercial or academic offerings.\" Additionally, it notes that \"some are in german only,\" which adds to the complexity of obtaining and implementing these voices. This situation contrasts with languages like Finnish or Russian, which can be easily installed via package managers, and differs from the simple file download and renaming method described for some other voices. The answer also suggests looking into MBROLA voices as a potential alternative, indicating that while German TTS for Festival exists, it may require more effort or resources to implement compared to other languages."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/68183", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/22949/"], "docs_id": 68183, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First, some background:\nI am an IT teacher\\-in\\-training and I'm trying to introduce the boolean operators of java to my 10th grade class. My teacher\\-mentor looked over a worksheet I prepared and commented that I could let them use just a single \\& or \\| to denote the operators, because they \"do the same thing\". \n\nI am aware of the difference between \\& and \\&\\&.  \n\n\\& is a bitwise operator intended for use between integers, to perform \"bit\\-twiddling\".  \n\n\\&\\& is a conditional operator intended for use between boolean values. \n\nTo prove the point that these operators do not always \"do the same thing\" I set out to find an example where using the bitwise between boolean values would lead to an error. [I found this example](http://www.janeg.ca/scjp/oper/bitwiseAndLogical.html) \n\n```\nboolean bitwise;\nboolean conditional;\nint i=10, j=12;\nbitwise = (i<j) | ((i=3) > 5); // value of i after oper: 3\nSystem.out.println(bitwise+ \" \"+ i);\ni=10; \nconditional = (i<j) || (i=3) > 5 ;  // value of i after oper: 10\nSystem.out.println(conditional+ \" \"+ i);\ni=10; \nbitwise = (i>j) & (i=3) > 5;   // value of i after oper: 3\nSystem.out.println(bitwise+ \" \"+ i);\ni=10; \nconditional = (i>j) && (i=3) > 5;  // value of i after oper: 10\nSystem.out.println(conditional+ \" \"+ i);\n\n```\n\nThis example shows that if a value has to be changed by the second half of the expression, this would lead to a difference between the results, since bitwise is an eager operator, while the conditional behaves as a short circuit (does not evaluate the second half, if the first half is false in the case of \\&\\& and true in the case of \\|\\|).\n\nI have an issue with this example. Why would you want to change a value at the same time as you do a comparision on it? It doesn't seem like a robust way to code. I've always been averse to doing multiple operations in a single line in my production code. It seems like something a \"coding cowboy\" with no conscience as to the maintainability of his code would do. I know that in some domains code needs to be as compact as possible, but surely this is a poor practice in general?\n\nI can explain my choice of encouraging the use of \\&\\& and \\|\\| over \\& and \\| because this is [an accepted coding convention in software engineering](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/EXP17-C.+Do+not+perform+bitwise+operations+in+conditional+expressions).\n\nBut could someone please give me a better, even real\\-world, example of using a bitwise operator in a conditional expression?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: it is appropriate when you are performing a masking operation\n\nif ((a \\& b) \\> 0\\) { ... }\n\nwhere a and b are integers\n\n\\|\\| and \\| and \\&\\& and \\& are not interchangable\n\n\\| and \\& will amost never appear in a conditional expression by themselves (the point of the link you included is that such things are most often errors)\n\nEDIT: Don't argue with your mentor; even if you win, you lose. Instead, explain that you don't want to confuse the students by mixing logical operators and bitwise operators in the same lesson. You could explain that if i\\=3 and j\\=2 then i\\&j \\= 2, while i\\&\\&j is an error. However, the simpler explanation is that you're teaching boolean (logical) operators, so throwing in special\\-case bitwise equivalents is a distraction from the main point of the lesson. There's no need to make the mentor \"wrong\", and no need to produce counter\\-examples. The focus of the lesson is on boolean operators, *not* bitwise operators.\n\nAs a corollary, when you start to teach bitwise operators, there's no need to show the special cases where \\+ and \\- produce the same results as \\& and \\|"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about bitwise (&, |) and logical (&&, ||) operators in Java is correct?\n\nA) Bitwise and logical operators can always be used interchangeably in conditional expressions without affecting the outcome.\n\nB) The bitwise AND operator (&) is more efficient than the logical AND operator (&&) in all scenarios.\n\nC) Bitwise operators should be preferred over logical operators when working with boolean values in conditional statements.\n\nD) Bitwise operators are appropriate for masking operations with integers, while logical operators are better suited for boolean conditions with potential short-circuit evaluation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately describes the appropriate use cases for bitwise and logical operators. Bitwise operators like & are suitable for integer masking operations (e.g., if ((a & b) > 0)), while logical operators like && are designed for boolean conditions and offer short-circuit evaluation. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they misrepresent the proper usage and characteristics of these operators. Bitwise and logical operators are not always interchangeable (A), bitwise operators are not universally more efficient (B), and logical operators are generally preferred for boolean conditions due to short-circuit evaluation and clarity (C)."}}
