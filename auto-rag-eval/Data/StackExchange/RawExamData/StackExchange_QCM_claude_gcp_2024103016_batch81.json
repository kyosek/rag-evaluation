Figure out what you would like the entire space to become (eventually) and make sure that the one wall that you are framing will fit in with those plans, or at least is flexible with future plans. It's not fun down the road having to rip down sections of a new wall to accommodate new plans, ESPECIALLY if you were the one to frame the first wall.\n\nWhile you are at it, make sure to run all the cables and future proofing items that you would want in the future in this one wall, or provide an easy way to have them installed. Install conduit (if possible) for power and another for telecommunications (Cat5e/Cat6, Telephone, etc). If you don't want to run conduit, at least pre\\-drill the holes, and leave a pull string in the holes to help with fishing wires. I wish I thought of this before finishing portions of our basement."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When planning to finish a portion of a basement wall for a home entertainment center, what is the most important consideration according to the expert advice given?\n\nA) Immediately applying drywall to the chosen wall\nB) Focusing solely on the placement of the flat screen TV\nC) Planning the entire basement layout before framing any walls\nD) Applying epoxy pebble stone flooring first\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert advises to \"plan out the entire basement before you frame the one wall.\" This approach ensures that the partially finished wall will fit with future plans for the space and prevents the need for costly rework later. The answer also emphasizes thinking about cable management and future-proofing, which aligns with a comprehensive planning approach.

I'm interested in related problems and references.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Final edit**\n\nThe answer to your question is positive for $n\\>1$, and this follow just from the fact that a holomorphic function defined on the complement to a pseudoconvex domain can be always extended to the domain for $n\\>1$. For $n\\=1$ the statement not true (as Pietro Majer says correctly says it). There is a reference now given in a comment by Margaret Friedland that justifies this answer. \n\nIn the case that you consider there is a holomorphic map from \n$M\\\\setminus K$ to $\\\\mathbb C^n\\\\setminus \\\\bar B\\_1$, i.e. you have $n$ holomorphic functions \non $M\\\\setminus K$. Each of these functions can be extended to $M$ provided $n\\>1$ since $K$ is pseudoconvex in $M$. So you get a proper holomorphic map from $M$ to $\\\\mathbb C^n$. Moreover this map is birational (or of degree one in other words), so $M$ is a contractible topological space only if the map is an isomorphism (otherwise there will be some exceptional divisors on $M$ that will be contracted to points by the map and so the topology of $M$ will be non\\-trivial).\n\nHere is the mathscient citation for the reference given by Margaret Friedland\n\n\"The authors prove the following: If $M$ is a \ufb01nite complex manifold with \nconnected boundary $bM$ such that the Levi form has one positive eigenvalue everywhere on $bM$, then every function on $bM$\nwhich satis\ufb01es the \u201ctangential Cauchy\\-Riemann equations\u201d on $bM$ has a holomorphic extension to the whole of $M$.\"\n\nNote that the boundary of a ball in $\\\\mathbb C^n$ has positive Levi form (for $n\\>1$) and the \"tangential Cauchy\\-Riemann\" equation is automatically satisfied provided the function is defined and holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $bM$. Clearly we can assume the later in our case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let M be a complex manifold of dimension N\u22652 satisfying:\n1) M is diffeomorphic to R^(2N)\n2) There exists a compact set K\u2286M such that M\\K is biholomorphic to C^N\\B\u0304_1 (where B\u0304_1 is the closed unit ball)\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) M must be biholomorphic to C^N for all N\u22652\nB) M must be biholomorphic to C^N only for N>2\nC) M may not be biholomorphic to C^N for any N\u22652\nD) The biholomorphism of M to C^N depends on the specific properties of the compact set K\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The answer is positive for all N>1 (which is equivalent to N\u22652 in this context). This is because:\n\n1) For N>1, holomorphic functions defined on the complement of a pseudoconvex domain can always be extended to the domain.\n2) In this case, we have N holomorphic functions on M\\K that can be extended to M since K is pseudoconvex in M.\n3) This extension gives a proper holomorphic map from M to C^N.\n4) The map is birational (degree one), and M is diffeomorphic to R^(2N) (thus contractible).\n5) If the map weren't an isomorphism, there would be exceptional divisors on M contracted to points, making M's topology non-trivial.\n6) Therefore, the map must be an isomorphism, making M biholomorphic to C^N for all N\u22652.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they either limit the result unnecessarily, contradict the proven result, or introduce an unwarranted dependency."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/10/12", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/661461", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/233532/"], "docs_id": 661461, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: how to change the code so it don't overlap like in the picture\nif its possible that the first if go the second Output with out overlap other rows.\nSecondly is there another possibility to make new line inside the if section.\n\nthank you for your support.\n\n```tex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows,shapes}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 1.2cm, auto]\n    \\tikzstyle{startstop} = [rectangle, rounded corners, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm,text centered, draw=black, fill=red!30]\n    \\tikzstyle{io} = [trapezium, trapezium left angle=70, trapezium right angle=110, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=blue!30]\n    \\tikzstyle{process} = [rectangle, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=orange!30]\n    \\tikzstyle{decision} = [diamond, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=green!30]\n    \\tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]\n\n    % Place nodes\n    \\node (start) [startstop] {Start};\n\n    \\node (in1) [io, below of=start] {Input: f(), a, b, $\\varepsilon$};\n\n    \\node (pro1) [process, below of=in1] {c=(a+b)/2};\n\n    \\node (if1) [decision, below of=pro1, yshift=-1.5cm] {if: f(a)*f(b)$>$0};\n\n    %   \\node (pro1) [process, below of=in1] {Process 1};\n    \\node (dec1) [decision, below of=if1, yshift=-4cm] {While: f(c) $\\not=$ 0 \\& $|$f(b) -

I'd say only around 40% of the packages installed on my system have a homepage listed.\n\nThere is no simple way to (programatically) determine the license of a package. The Debian control file has no field for a license title. License details for a package *foo* should be given in the `/usr/share/doc/<foo>/copyright` file. However, there is no standard format for these files. Some of them are fairly simple and basically say *this is released under the GPL v3, see /usr/share/common\\-licenses/GPL\\-3 for the full license text*. Others have a custom license included in full. Complex packages can have different licenses for different pieces of it (e.g., one for the program and another for graphics). Often, the license of the Debian packaging information is also included.\n\nIn short: it is simple to manually get the license for a single package.

While alcohol distribution was generally illegal during Prohibition, there were exceptions (e.g., for medicinal or religious purposes). Using \"illicit\" suggests that the character knows their activities are generally disallowed but recognizes that under different circumstances, they could be legal.

Specifically:\n\n1) At x*, p^T\u2207f(x*) = -||\u2207f(x*)||\u00b2 < 0\n2) The function F(x) = p^T\u2207f(x) is continuous because \u2207f is continuous\n3) By the continuity of F, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that F(x) < 0 for all ||x - x*|| < \u03b4\n4) We can choose T > 0 small enough so that ||x* + tp - x*|| = t||p|| < \u03b4 for all t \u2208 [0,T]\n5) Therefore, p^T\u2207f(x* + tp) < 0 for all t \u2208 [0,T]\n\nA is incorrect because it claims the opposite sign.\nC is incorrect because p^T\u2207f(x*) \u2260 0, so it can't be zero for all t.\nD is incorrect because the continuity of \u2207f is sufficient to make claims about the sign near x*."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/13", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/297142", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/360951/"], "docs_id": 297142, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new to Stack Overflow, and currently have 1 rep status (at the moment, I just posted three answers there).\n\nA few minutes back, the reputation section in my profile summary showed that I was awarded 10 reputation in relation to [this post answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44516947/how-to-read-relevant-information-from-maven-dependency-tree-using-regex-in-perl/44523920#44523920).

In which conditions? I would guess only when the degree of the trend is a multiple of the lag used in the filter.\n\nA simple example of seasonal integration with a seasonal period $m$ is a series made up of $m$ alternating independent random walks. That is, take random walks $x\\_{1,t},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,t}$ and form a series $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ of the form\n$$\nx\\_{1,1},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,1},x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,2},x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,3},\\\\dots .\n$$\nA seasonally differenced process then will be \n$$\n\\\\Delta x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,\\\\Delta x\\_{m,2},\\\\Delta x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,\\\\Delta x\\_{m,3},\\\\dots\n$$\nwhere $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}:\\=x\\_{i,t}\\-x\\_{i,t\\-1}$. So seasonal differencing applied on $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ is equivalent to simple differencing applied on the alternating component series. The same is true for higher\\-order seasonal differencing of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ vs. higher\\-order simple differencing of the component series. So from this point on we can consider simple differencing of the component series instead of seasonal differencing of the original series.\n\nIf $x\\_{i,t}$ has a linear trend, $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}$ will no longer have it.  \n\nIf $x\\_{i,t}$ has a quadratic trend, $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}$ will have a linear one, but $\\\\Delta^2 x\\_{i,t}$ will have none.  \n\nAnd so on for higher\\-order polynomial trends vs. higher\\-order differencing.\n\n> Second, are both the seasonal differencing and the simple (repeated) differencing interchangeable?\n\nNo, they are not intechangeable.  \n\nConsider the setup presented above.  \n\n*Seasonal* differencing only involves simple differencing of the alternating component series. Therefore, $x\\_{i,s}$ never gets \"mixed up\" (i.e. added to or subtracted from) $x\\_{j,t}$, where $i\\\\neq j$. The different component series remain separated, and a seasonal difference of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ of order $D$ can be written as an alternating sequence of simple differences of order $D$ of the component series.  \n\nMeanwhile, *simple* differencing of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ \"mixes up\" the component series: you get values like $x\\_{2,1}\\-x\\_{1,1},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,1}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,1},x\\_{1,2}\\-x\\_{m,1},x\\_{2,2}\\-x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,2}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,2},x\\_{1,3}\\-x\\_{m,2},x\\_{2,3}\\-x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,3}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,3}$ etc. I do not think you could \"unmix\" the components by taking higher order simple differences, it would rather go the other way around \\-\\- you would be involving even more different series (up to a point where all series are involved, of course).\n\n> Is working with a time series by first taking out the trend and then seasonality the same as working with a t.s. by first taking out the seasonality and then the trend?\n\nI guess it depends on how exactly you are doing this. Algebraically this is certainly possible; you can always write $(x\\_t\\+s\\_t)\\+t\\=(x\\_t\\+t)\\+s\\_t$ where $s\\_t$ stands for the seasonal component and $t$ for a linear time trend. But when you try to achieve this using a particular model being estimated on some data, the equivalence (or lack thereof) between the fitted values of the seasonal and the trend components will depend on the model."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a time series with both a polynomial trend and seasonal components.

As explained in the documentation, seasonal differencing of the original series is equivalent to simple differencing of the alternating component series.\n2.

This might seem counterintuitive, but it's correct because John can walk twice as fast as he can swim.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1) Walking speed (v_w) = 6 m/s, Swimming speed (v_s) = 3 m/s\n2) Pool radius (r) = 10 m\n3) Time to walk full circumference = 2\u03c0r / v_w = 2\u03c0(10) / 6 \u2248 10.47 seconds\n4) Time to swim diameter = 2r / v_s = 20 / 3 \u2248 6.67 seconds\n\nAny combination of walking part of the way and swimming the chord will take longer than simply walking the entire circumference.

If you adjoin two roots of a quintic, you get a field extension of degree $\\\\leq 20$. Hence the condition $\\[E:\\\\mathbb Q] \\> 24$ yields that the polynomial is not solvable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let f(x) be an irreducible quintic polynomial over \u211a with splitting field E. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the solvability of f(x) by radicals?\n\nA) If |Gal(E/\u211a)| > 24, then f(x) is always solvable by radicals.\nB) If |Gal(E/\u211a)| = 30 or 40, then f(x) is always solvable by radicals.\nC) If [E:\u211a] > 24, then f(x) is not solvable by radicals.\nD) The solvability of f(x) depends only on whether |Gal(E/\u211a)| is 60 or 120.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. If [E:\u211a] > 24, then f(x) is not solvable by radicals. This follows from Galois' result that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree is solvable if and only if its splitting field is obtained by adjoining two roots. For a quintic polynomial, adjoining two roots would result in a field extension of degree \u2264 20. Therefore, if [E:\u211a] > 24, the polynomial cannot be solvable by radicals.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a large Galois group often indicates non-solvability. \nOption B is false because the order of the Galois group alone doesn't guarantee solvability.\nOption D is incorrect as it ignores cases where |Gal(E/\u211a)| could be 30 or 40, and doesn't consider the degree of the field extension."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/06", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/189301", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/115320/"], "docs_id": 189301, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the planning stages of finishing my basement and had a quick question about insulation. \n\nCurrently there is foil faced fiberglass insulation on the walls in the basement.

Any suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main difference of the different insulation related to the water and moisture is that fiberglass is a fabric with lots of small pieces and lots of open air spaces while the others are solid. Fiberglass can take on and hold moisture and is an ideal place for mold to grow. The solid insulation can not absorb water, and does not allow mold to grow within it which is a very desirable trait in higher moisture situations such as basement walls.\n\nThe moisture can and may likely be there and an issue even if there isn't enough water to get to the sump pump. And even if the exterior of the wall and soil is dry, this is because the air in the basement is usually warmer than the concrete basement wall in contact with the cooler ground soil. When moisture in the air contacts the colder surface it can condensate much like water on the outside of a glass of ice water.\n\nI strongly suggest replacing the insulation. It will likely have a higher insulation rating too."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is considering replacing the existing foil-faced fiberglass insulation in their basement with foam board insulation.

As stated in the documentation, solid insulation like foam board cannot absorb water and does not allow mold to grow within it, making it ideal for potentially damp environments like basements. Fiberglass, being a fabric-like material with many air spaces, can absorb and hold moisture, creating an environment conducive to mold growth. This resistance to moisture-related issues is particularly important in basements, where condensation can occur due to temperature differences between the interior air and the concrete walls, even if there's no visible water intrusion."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/27", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/189600", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/18502/"], "docs_id": 189600, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When trading with an AI civilization, I often use the \"What would make this deal work\" button as an easy way to see what the AI would like in exchange for a resource I want.\n\nWhen the answer is \"I don't see how we can make this work\", is this a final answer or can I make it work in some way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: Yes, but...\n\nI find that this response means that they firmly dislike you, but they would be willing to accept the trade if you had *significantly* more to offer them.\n\nFor example, when I go for a culture/tourism victory, I want to have an Open Border agreement with everyone for additional tourism per turn.

The semiparametric proportional odds ordinal logistic model is indeed a generalization of the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests, allowing for more complex analyses.\n\nB) This statement is correct. One of the advantages of this model is its ability to handle multiple covariates while still maintaining good statistical power.\n\nC) This statement is correct.

I understand that since they are vector quantities they have to have both direction and magnitude, but I don't see the usefulness of the direction?

Let's say you only have the torque vector. (Please reference [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20120229183526/http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~jenolive/vectorq.gif) link).\n\nBecause torque is defined as the cross product of the radius vector and the force vector ($\\\\tau \\= r \\\\times F$), you know that the object is rotating on a plane perpendicular to this vector. \n\nIf the vector is pointing upward, you know that the torque must be applied in a counterclockwise direction, and if the vector is pointing downward, you know that the torque is applied in a clockwise direction. This realization comes directly from the cross product definition of torque. \n\nYou gain even more information from the length of the vector, as it tells you how much \"oomph\" the quantity has."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A torque vector \u03c4 = 5k N\u00b7m is applied to a rigid body, where k is the unit vector in the z-direction.

According to the right-hand rule for cross products, this indicates a counterclockwise rotation when viewed from above (looking down the z-axis). The magnitude of the torque is indeed 5 N\u00b7m.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes a clockwise rotation, which would correspond to a torque vector pointing in the negative z-direction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because we can determine the direction of rotation from the given torque vector.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the direction of the torque vector is meaningful - it indicates the axis of rotation and the sense of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\nThis question tests understanding of torque as a vector quantity, the relationship between torque direction and rotation, and the interpretation of vector notation."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/03/15", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/648196", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/65060/"], "docs_id": 648196, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the best (and fastest) way to retrieve a random row using Linq to SQL when I have a condition, e.g. some field must be true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can do this at the database, by using a fake UDF; in a partial class, add a method to the data context:\n\n```\npartial class MyDataContext {\n     [Function(Name=\"NEWID\", IsComposable=true)] \n     public Guid Random() \n     { // to prove not used by our C# code... \n         throw new NotImplementedException(); \n     }\n}\n\n```\n\nThen just `order by ctx.Random()`; this will do a random ordering at the SQL\\-Server courtesy of `NEWID()`. i.e.\n\n```\nvar cust = (from row in ctx.Customers\n           where row.IsActive // your filter\n           orderby ctx.Random()\n           select row).FirstOrDefault();\n\n```\n\nNote that this is only suitable for small\\-to\\-mid\\-size tables; for huge tables, it will have a performance impact at the server, and it will be more efficient to find the number of rows (`Count`), then pick one at random (`Skip/First`).\n\n---\n\nfor count approach:\n\n```\nvar qry = from row in ctx.Customers\n          where row.IsActive\n          select row;\n\nint count = qry.Count(); // 1st round-trip\nint index = new Random().Next(count);\n\nCustomer cust = qry.Skip(index).FirstOrDefault(); // 2nd round-trip\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to retrieve a random row from a SQL database using LINQ to SQL, with the condition that a specific field must be true.

It uses two round-trips to the database: one to get the count of matching rows, and another to retrieve a specific row using Skip and Take. This method avoids ordering the entire table, which can be resource-intensive for large datasets.\n\nOption A, while simple, uses a custom Random() function that maps to NEWID() in SQL Server. This approach can have performance impacts on large tables as it requires ordering the entire result set.\n\nOption C uses Guid.NewGuid() directly in LINQ, which doesn't translate efficiently to SQL and would require bringing all data client-side for sorting.\n\nOption D attempts to use a subquery with OrderBy and Guid.NewGuid(), which suffers from the same inefficiencies as option C and adds unnecessary complexity."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/17", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/4515", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/1470/"], "docs_id": 4515, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to documentation, the options are:\nSyntax\n\n> ExportToTIFF (map\\_document, out\\_tiff, {data\\_frame}, {df\\_export\\_width},\n>  {df\\_export\\_height}, {resolution}, {world\\_file}, {color\\_mode},\n>  {tiff\\_compression}, {geoTIFF\\_tags})\n\nHowever, this works:\n\n```\nimport arcpy.mapping\nmxd = arcpy.mapping.MapDocument(\"CURRENT\")\narcpy.mapping.ListDataFrames(mxd)\narcpy.mapping.ExportToTIFF(mxd,r\"D:\\out2.tif\",\"PAGE_LAYOUT\",640,480,96)\n\n```\n\nbut this:\n\n```\narcpy.mapping.ExportToTIFF(mxd,r\"D:\\out2.tif\",\"PAGE_LAYOUT\",640,480,96,True)\n\n```\n\nyields:\n `Runtime error <type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: PageLayoutObject: Error in executing ExportToTIFF`\n\nAm I doing something wrong with that Boolean for world\\_file?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe the World file option is only available if you export from a data frame, not the page layout.\n\nFrom [Exporting your Map](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00sm00000004000000.htm)\n\n> TIFF\\-specific options\n> \n> \n> The TIFF file format has the additional ability\n> to store georeferencing information internally.

If you choose more than $(n\\-1\\)2^{n\\+2}$ vectors, then $n$ of them must lie in one of those translates, and therefore in an $(n\\-1\\)$\\-dimensional subspace.

Shortening the wire brings the voltage at the load closer to the line voltage, but it doesn't reduce the current or temperature of the wire; instead, shortening increases the current.\n\nThe heat generated by the current in the wire affects the temperature of the wire, which is the primary limiting safety factor.\n\nThe heating of a \\#10 wire under 50ft of length is only marginally affected by its length. Provided the wire is properly installed, you generally don't get extra safety margin by keeping it short.\n\nFor a given load, a short wire generates more heat *per foot* than a long wire. This is due to the higher voltage at the load if the wire is short, and the resulting higher current through the entire wire.\n\nWhile length is an important factor in the voltage drop it is not a factor in the wire's temperature, provided the wire is installed correctly.\n\nLong wires at maximum current generate more heat over their full length than short wires at about the same current, but if installed in runs (e.g. in joist spaces, from panel to kitchen), and not in bunches or loops, the heat generated per unit of length matters, not the total heat. This is illustrated in the example below.\n\nExample: 30A over 10AWG\n-----------------------\n\nHave a look at the calculations below. They are based on a 120V supply and a 4 Ohm load to produce a nominal 30A current.\n\nAs the cabling distance (and wire length) increases, the resistance of the wire increases and reduces the current in the wire.\n\nAt the 50ft distance (100ft wire, return loop), the voltage a load has dropped to 117V (about 3% drop).\n\nThis is where the maximum length recommendations for wires (such as 50ft for 10AWG) come into the picture: the intent is to not let the voltage at a heavy load drop by too much.\n\nAs the wire takes on more resistance, so does the power generated by it over its full length. It's up to 85W over a 50ft distance.\n\nHowever, the power generated \"per foot of length\" is more indicative of the temperature rise of the wire, and that power drops from 1\\.8W/ft to 1\\.7W/ft.\n\nThis drop is not much but it should dissuade anyone from thinking that the the maximum current of 30A for a AWG10 wire can somehow be exceeded if the wire is short. No, short wires cannot tolerate more current than long wires.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T30Jb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T30Jb.png)\n\nPower drops for very long wires\n-------------------------------\n\nI did make an earlier statement that the power per foot as well as the total power drop as the wire is lengthened. This is partially true: the total power increases and the power per foot decreases for the \"electrician's\" use cases such as the one illustrated here, whereby the wire resistance is (much) smaller than the load's resistance.\n\nBut in in a more *general* context (not applicable to an electrician's case) the wire can have a resistance equal or more than the load. Then as the wire is lengthened more and its resistance starts to exceed that of the load the total power generated by the wire will diminish as the wire becomes longer.\n\nHave a look at the additional cases below. This shows what happens when the wire resistance starts to exceed that of the load. The numbers here are a bit ridiculous, but that's because I just kept using 10AWG. Nevertheless, these kinds of effects do occur in an electronic signalling systems with much lower gauge wires.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaHqP.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaHqP.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is wiring a 30A circuit using 10 AWG wire.

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The electrician is right - shorter wire runs can safely handle higher currents than their rating.\nB) The wire can handle 30A continuously because it's rated for 30A peak current.\nC) The short length reduces voltage drop, allowing for higher current capacity.\nD) The wire's current capacity is not increased by the short length and should still be limited to 24A continuous.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The current capacity of a wire is primarily determined by the heat generated in the wire, not its length. Shortening a wire does not allow it to safely carry more current than its rating. In fact, for a given load, a short wire generates more heat per foot than a long wire. The 10 AWG wire is rated for 24A continuous regardless of length, and exceeding this could lead to overheating and potential safety hazards. While the short length reduces voltage drop, it does not increase the wire's ability to dissipate heat safely. Therefore, the 24A continuous rating should still be respected, even for very short runs."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/03/17", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/418325", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/172600/"], "docs_id": 418325, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a PhD student and during my research I was presented to the claim that\n\n**For a positive definite function $f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ continuous in $0$, with $0$ a stable point at $t\\=0$ for $x$, one has\n$${\\\\lim\\\\inf}\\_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} f(x(t))\\=0\\\\Longrightarrow {\\\\lim\\\\inf}\\_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\\\|x(t)\\\\\\|\\=0\\.$$**\n\nIn this context,\n\n> We say that a function $f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is positive definite if $f(x)\\\\geq 0$ and $f(x)\\=0\\\\iff x\\=0\\.$\n\n> We say that $p$ is a stable point at $t\\_0$ if, for any neighborhood $H$ of $p$, there's a neighboorhood $V$ of $p$ s.t. if $x(t\\_0\\)\\\\in V$, then $x(t)\\\\in H$ for all $t\\>t\\_0\\.$\n\nI thought this is not true without more hypothesis.

My guess would be that gold data is data which has been manually tagged, rather than learned by some process. However, I'm not too sure. So, what is the meaning of this phrase?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're probably referring to ***gold standard*** data. This refers to data of very high quality, which is more or less as close as you can get to the ground truth. For example, Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed through behavioral tests, but it's not a perfect diagnosis and can be confused with other types of dementia. A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be made by performing an autopsy on the brain, resulting in an unambiguous diagnosis about which there is no uncertainty. In this case, the autopsy diagnosis represents the gold standard test.\n\nGold standard data is great for machine learning tasks, since it is known to be of high quality, and avoids the \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem. If you want to build a model to predict Alzheimer's disease, you'd much rather have the brain autopsy data, since there will be virtually no mislabeled data. Gold standard data may be hard to come by, however, due to it being difficult or expensive to obtain. I'll also note that while gold standard data represents the highest possible data quality, it still may not be perfect."}, "answer": "Question: In machine learning, what is the primary characteristic of \"gold standard\" data, and why is it particularly valuable for training models?\n\nA) It's data that has been processed using advanced algorithms, making it more reliable for model training.\nB) It's data that has been manually tagged by experts, ensuring high accuracy but potentially introducing human bias.\nC) It's data that is as close as possible to ground truth, often obtained through definitive methods, providing the highest quality input for model training.\nD) It's synthetic data generated by AI to perfectly match the desired outcomes, eliminating real-world inconsistencies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. \"Gold standard\" data in machine learning refers to data that is as close as possible to the ground truth, often obtained through definitive methods. This makes it extremely valuable for training models because:\n\n1. It represents the highest possible data quality, minimizing the \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem.\n2. It provides a reliable benchmark against which other data or model outputs can be compared.\n3. It typically has very few or no mislabeled instances, which is crucial for accurate model training.\n4. It often comes from definitive sources or methods, like the brain autopsy example for Alzheimer's diagnosis mentioned in the text.\n\nOption A is incorrect because gold standard data isn't necessarily processed by algorithms; its value comes from its closeness to ground truth.\n\nOption B, while touching on manual tagging, misses the key aspect of gold standard data being as close to ground truth as possible, often through definitive methods rather than expert opinion.\n\nOption D is incorrect as gold standard data is not synthetic or AI-generated, but rather represents the best available real-world data."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/18", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/433305", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/218810/"], "docs_id": 433305, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOu37.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOu37.png)\n\nI'm trying to achieve reverse polarity protection for the TPL7404LADR chip which is basically an updated version of the ULN2003 darling transistor array.

Maybe I missed it, but I don't see a specification for the maximum reverse current through an output (the 0\\.3V negative voltage will be exceeded). Since the voltage drop of the body diode is considerably higher than the NMOS MOSFET when on, most likely, the current handling capability may be considerably less in the reverse direction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit using the TPL7404LADR chip (an updated version of the ULN2003 Darlington transistor array) with reverse polarity protection using a P-Channel MOSFET. The circuit will be used to control inductive loads such as solenoids.

When using a P-Channel MOSFET for reverse polarity protection, the MOSFET will allow the chip's internal free-wheeling diodes to conduct flyback current back to the power source. This is because the P-Channel MOSFET, when properly configured for reverse polarity protection, acts as a low-resistance path in the forward direction (normal operation). When an inductive load like a solenoid is switched off, the flyback current can flow through the chip's internal free-wheeling diodes and then through the P-Channel MOSFET back to the power source. This configuration maintains the functionality of the chip's built-in protection mechanisms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the P-Channel MOSFET does not block flyback current in the reverse direction.

I want to investigate within group differences. All time/condition points are important, I don't have a \"control\" time point.\n\nAny opinions on the following:\n\n1. If I am comfortable that sphericity is assumed by Mauchly's Test not being violated, would a multivariate Lambda F test statistic be more appropriate or a sphericity assumed estimate (within\\-condition estimate from SPSS)?\n2. If I choose to go with the understanding that despite a test result saying it is OK, assuming sphericity may still be over\\-confident, any thoughts on potentially reporting ALL\nGreenhouse\\-Geiser estimates regardless of Mauchly's or Lambda? I have read that this may reduce the chance of a Type\\-1 error without having to assume sphericity or equality of covariance matrices. Perhaps too overcautious? Or, is potentially adjusting df's more invasive than assuming sphericity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: so... here is a bit of a dog's breakfast of suggestions\n\nThere are more ways to approach this than the options you give yourself. One of them might be to take your three reward levels, one being neutral, and turn them into two reward effects. So, if C is neutral reward, and A and B are test levels makes up an A effect (A\\-C) and a B effect (B\\-C) and then compare them to each other. Because there are only two levels sphericity is not an issue. And then you're actually comparing your two effects. Do *not* make the mistake of testing A\\-C, and finding it significant and B\\-C, and finding it not, and then concluding there's a difference between A\\-C, and B\\-C. The difference between those two may not be significant in itself.\n\nMauchly's test, like all such tests, isn't terribly useful. It will fail all of the time with enought power, even if the sphericity violation isn't too bad and you can pass it all of the time with very low power. It definitely shouldn't be used like a hypothesis test in the Neyman\\-Pearson sense. No test of assumptions should be. Meeting your assumptions is a qualitative decision and Mauchly can help you with that but it's not used as a hard decision rule. Along those same lines, always using GG corrections can reduce the amount of Type I error that you make, as you inquired. However, it can also increase the amount of Type II. \n\nAnd assuming sphericity isn't invasive at all... Describing it that way makes it sounds like you have a little bit too much reverence for your data and believe there's some church of decisions here. If you want to be conservative in your tests, GG everything and Bonferroni correct. But, if you do that, recognize that you're possibly making Type II errors and note that in your write up. If you don't want to do any of that then don't, but make sure that then you draw weaker conclusions about your tests, especially multiple ones and use them to point the way for future researchers to look.\n\nIf you want to go multivariate knock yourself out. It helps with the sphericity issue, if there is one. It doesn't fix multiple testing issues. But you should pick one beforehand and stick with it, not run all kinds of different analyses and see which makes your results look better. That's a whole different level of multiple comparisons. Posting your actual Mauchly test numbers and GG corrections on here might result in you getting some expert advice on how large a violation they are. It's unlikely they're big given that you only have 3\\-levels.\n\nSpeaking of 3\\-levels, there are no GG corrections for when you have two levels. There is no test of sphericity then. If you decide to make three comparisons, A\\-B, A\\-C, B\\-C, then none of these if GG corrected.\n\nA final option you haven't mentioned is to calculate confidence intervals for each of your 3 comparisons and speak about them rationally. You could alpha adjust them if you wish, or even put two levels of bars on a graph. Then you just describe what are likely and unlikely to be the true values of the effect. So, if A\\-C does not cross 0 then 0 is an unlikely value. Only the values within the CI are likely.\n\nAs you can see, the reason you haven't gotten hard answers to your questions is that, despite your having formulated them well, there are only hard answers to small aspects of what you want to know. That can get firmer when someone has real numbers and hypotheses to deal with. To get more specific help in your description, multiple comparison issues, and some expert advice on how to treat your data, then make a new query with your analyses posted, numbers and what they mean, what your hypotheses are, and what you hope to find out or discuss. That will be more likely to land you some hard advice that's useful."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a study with 2 groups of equal sample size, measuring data over 3 time points (representing different monetary reward conditions). Which of the following approaches is most appropriate for analyzing within-group differences, considering the issues of sphericity and multiple comparisons?\n\nA) Always use Greenhouse-Geisser corrections regardless of Mauchly's test results to reduce Type I error, even if it may increase Type II error.\n\nB) Rely solely on Mauchly's test to determine whether to assume sphericity, using multivariate Lambda F test if sphericity is violated.\n\nC) Transform the three reward levels into two reward effects (e.g., A-C and B-C, where C is neutral) and compare these, eliminating the need for sphericity considerations.\n\nD) Calculate and report confidence intervals for each of the 3 comparisons (A-B, A-C, B-C), possibly with alpha adjustments, and interpret the results based on whether the intervals include zero.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate approach for several reasons:\n\n1. It avoids the limitations of relying solely on Mauchly's test, which can be unreliable with very high or low power.\n2. It doesn't make assumptions about sphericity, which can be problematic with only 3 levels.\n3. It allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the results, showing the likely range of true effect values rather than just dichotomous significant/non-significant decisions.\n4. It addresses multiple comparison issues by allowing for alpha adjustments if desired.\n5. It provides a clear visual representation of the results that can be easily communicated and interpreted.\n\nOption A is overly conservative and may lead to unnecessary Type II errors. Option B places too much emphasis on Mauchly's test, which shouldn't be used as a hard decision rule. Option C, while creative, changes the nature of the original research question and doesn't fully utilize all the data collected."}}
