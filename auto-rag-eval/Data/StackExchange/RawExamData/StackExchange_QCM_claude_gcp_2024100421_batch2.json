I noticed it when emails sent to my forwarded domain didn't arrive and people asked me what was up. I experimented with changing the forwarding to point to several completely different destination accounts with no luck. Then I used telnet to connect to port 25 of mail.zoneedit.com and test the connection and found that the mail server is rejecting connections due to it being unable to do a reverse address lookup on the IP address of the system attempting to connect, presumably a mail server attempting to send a message to the mail forwarder.\n\nI've already placed a couple of tech support calls with the company that owns Zoneedit, they're aware of the problem and tell me the guys that manage the server in Vancouver, BC are working on the problem.

Searched the net, but couldnt find a GOOD one. Want to know how packets moves, importance of MAC address, how IP and MAC address are related.. Looking for a step by step guide. Some thing like [From Power Up To Bash Prompt](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I wrote about [IPv4 subnetting and routing](https://serverfault.com/questions/49765/how-does-subnetting-work) in an earlier posting. I didn't talk about layer 2 / layer 3 interaction there so, being that I'm stuck in a hospital waiting for a friend's baby to be born, I'll go ahead and expound here a bit.\n\nIP, being a layer 3 protocol, gets encapsulated into a layer 2 protocol when IP datagrams are put onto a physical (layer 1\\) medium. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) helps to facilitate the layer 2 communication to encapsulate the layer 3 traffic between hosts. (ARP can be used by layer 3 protocols other than IP and by layer 2 protocols other than Ethernet, but for the purposes of this example I am sticking with IP over Ethernet.)\n\nAs simplistic example, imagine two hosts with IP addresses and subnet masks configured such that both hosts are in the same subnet. These hosts are connected to the same Ethernet broadcast domain. It would be possible for these hosts to communicate by way of Ethernet broadcasts, however that would make inefficient use of the broadcast medium (switches flooding the frames to all destinations, which is also a bit of a security risk though relying on Ethernet switches not to forward unicast traffic as a security mechanism is laughable). The most efficient use of the Ethernet medium would be for each host to communicate to the other by way of packets addressed to the unicast Media Access Control (MAC) address of the other host. ARP allows the hosts to \"learn\" each others MAC address to facilitate this unicast communication.\n\n* Host A: IP address 10\\.0\\.0\\.1/24, MAC address 00:01:de:ad:be:ef\n* Host B: IP address 10\\.0\\.0\\.2/24, MAC address 00:01:0b:ad:f0:0d\n\nHost A has a datagram to be delivered to host B. Host A consults its cache of previously learned MAC to IP address mappings (known as the *ARP cache*) and finds no entry matching the datagram's destination address (10\\.0\\.0\\.2\\). Host A transmits an ARP packet, addressed to the Ethernet broadcast destination address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff), essentially \"asking\" the question \"Who has the IP address 10\\.0\\.0\\.2 assigned?\". Because this is a broadcast packet the Ethernet switch floods this frame to all destinations.\n\nHost B receives this packet, detects that its own IP address is in the \"target protocol address\" field of this broadcast ARP packet (the \"question\"), and responds with an ARP packet, addressed to the MAC address of host A (which it \"learned\" from the broadcast ARP request, sent from host A's MAC address) with its own MAC address substituted in the \"target hardware address\" field of the ARP packet. \n\nHost A receives the ARP response from host B. With the information contained in the response it then has sufficient knowledge to address the IP datagram, when encapsulated into an Ethernet frame, to the MAC address of host B. This results in unicast traffic from host A to host B. \n\nTo prevent the need for an ARP exchange for each datagram each host maintains a cache of the IP to MAC mappings that it \"learns\" for a period of time. The cache typically has a maximum possible size and expiration of the mappings prevents the table from filling. Expiration of the mappings also allows a host to communicate with a different MAC address (possibly as a result of changing out a network interface card or for other reasons). Typical ARP cache expiration times range from under one minute to several minutes.\n\nIn the case of hosts separated by routers the ARP process is the same as the process described above, except that it occurs between the sending host and the router to which it will be sending the packets for final delivery. Typically, a host would ARP for its default gateway (as most hosts don't have multiple static routes configured but, rather, have only a single router to a default gateway configured). Once a host has the IP to MAC mapping for its default gateway and IP datagrams bound for hosts in other subnets will be encapsulated in Ethernet frames addressed to the MAC address of the default gateway router."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between IP addresses, MAC addresses, and the ARP process in network communication?\n\nA) ARP is used to translate IP addresses to domain names, while MAC addresses are only used for local network communication.\n\nB) IP addresses are used for layer 2 communication, while MAC addresses are used for layer 3 routing between subnets.\n\nC) ARP allows hosts to discover the MAC address associated with an IP address, enabling efficient unicast communication on an Ethernet network.\n\nD) MAC addresses are permanently stored in the ARP cache, eliminating the need for ARP requests after the initial communication between two hosts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately describes the purpose and function of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) in network communication.

Let C_b(X) be the space of bounded continuous functions on X. Given that for all f \u2208 C_b(X), the sequence \u03bcn(f) is Cauchy as n \u2192 \u221e, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The sequence \u03bcn always converges weakly to a probability measure on X.\n\nB) The sequence \u03bcn converges weakly if and only if it is uniformly tight.\n\nC) The limit functional m(f) = lim_n \u03bcn(f) always corresponds to a tight Radon measure on X by the Riesz Representation Theorem.\n\nD) The sequence \u03bcn converges weakly if and only if it does not \"lose mass at infinity\".\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationship between weak convergence of measures and uniform tightness. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Cauchy convergence of \u03bcn(f) for all f \u2208 C_b(X) does not guarantee weak convergence of the measures. We need additional conditions.\n\nOption B is correct. This is essentially a restatement of Prokhorov's theorem, which states that a sequence of probability measures on a Polish space (which includes locally compact, separable metric spaces) is relatively compact in the weak topology if and only if it is uniformly tight.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Riesz Representation Theorem doesn't automatically apply to the limit functional m(f). We need additional conditions to ensure that m(f) corresponds to a tight Radon measure.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while \"not losing mass at infinity\" is related to tightness, it's not a precise enough condition to guarantee weak convergence.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the importance of uniform tightness in determining weak convergence of measure sequences, which is a central concept in the study of the strict topology on C_b(X) and its relationship to measure theory."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/57563", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/16986/"], "docs_id": 57563, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For me the Agent Analyst tool interface won't open. \n\nI have ArcGIS 10\\.1 sp1 installed on my computer. \n\nI have followed these steps so far:\n\n1. added the refresh.config.exe text file ([ArcGIS 10\\.1 using Repast's Agent Analyst Extension \\- refresh.exe does not work](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48655/arcgis-10-1-using-repasts-agent-analyst-extension-refresh-exe-does-not-work))\n2. changed values 10\\.0 to 10\\.1 in files agent\\_analyst.bat and agent\\_analyst\\_run.bat in agent analyst installation folder\n3\\- added the ArcGIS 10\\.1 installation path \"for example C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.1\" to environment variables ARC\\_JAVA \\& ARC\\_JAVAW \\& ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR ([Which GIS software or plugins can perform a Cellular Automata Simulation?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/44285/which-gis-software-or-plugins-can-perform-a-cellular-automata-simulation/44291#44291))\n\nI restarted and still have had no luck (just a black box flashes up when I create a new agent analyst tool or try to edit the tool). \n\nIs there some other step I need to do or have I done one of the above steps incorrectly? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I also got Agent Analyst to work with ArcGIS 10\\.2 (at least so far).

Create **Refresh.exe.config** file with a text editor and save it along with **Refresh.exe** (typically in **C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst\\\\Refresh**). The **Refresh.exe.config** contents will be identical to the contents of the configuration file described here (\"Update 2\"): [ArcGIS 10\\.1 using Repast's Agent Analyst Extension \\- refresh.exe does not work](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48655/arcgis-10-1-using-repasts-agent-analyst-extension-refresh-exe-does-not-work) but you must replace newVersion\\=\"10\\.1\\.0\\.0\" with newVersion\\=\"10\\.2\\.0\\.0\".\n2. As noted above, edit the **agent\\_analyst.bat** and **agent\\_analyst\\_run.bat** files in the installation folder (**C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst**) so that the folder paths contain Desktop10\\.2 in the folder path strings: \n\n```\nrem set ARC_JAVA=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\jre\\bin\\java\"\nrem set ARC_JAVAW=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\jre\\bin\\javaw\"\nrem set ARCOBJECTS_JAR=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\lib\\arcobjects.jar\"\n\n```\n3. Then, edit your Environment Variables to make sure that ARC\\_JAVA, ARC\\_JAVAW, and ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR have a fully specified path entered for each variable (like what is in the .bat files above).\n4. Then, in my Environment Variables, I had to move ARC\\_JAVA (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\jre\\\\bin\\\\java**), ARC\\_JAVAW (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\jre\\\\bin\\\\javaw**), ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\lib\\\\arcobjects.jar**), AGENT\\_ANALYST (**C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst**), and AGENT\\_ANALYST\\_VOL (**C:**) from my User Variables to my System Variables. Depending on your situation, I foresee that some people may not need to do this.

Area 51 additionally displays the number of avid users defined by meeting a certain threshold of reputation on the site. There is also a graph of new users in the moderator tools.\n\nI consider the total number of users, as it is displayed currently, a completely useless statistic. I have no way to determine how many of those users are actually active on the site, I can only see how many people have registered. Many of those might never have come back to the site. The number of new users in the moderator tools is also not very useful, as I have no idea if those new users actually come back to the site and contribute to it.\n\nThe number of avid users on Area 51 is also not a sufficient statistic, as it doesn't tell us if those high reputation users are still contributing to the site. Most users don't rage\\-quit and have their account deleted, they just fade away silently. Most sites likely have some users with a lot of reputation that are not contributing anymore.\n\n**The most important thing I want to see from the user statistics is whether the site is gaining or losing active users.** A site that is steadily gaining users that actively participate in the site, either by contributing posts or maybe just by reading and voting on the content, is a site I would consider healthy (barring any other severe problems). If a site that is hemorrhaging users, if the number of active users is shrinking over time that would be a very clear warning sign that there are severe problems with the site.\n\nIf the user base of a site is shrinking, it would be useful to see this problem as soon as possible to be able to take countermeasures. This is where a better statistic for the number of active users would be very handy. This would be especially important on beta sites, to better gauge the health of the site.\n\nFor this statistic we need to define what constitutes an \"active user\", some ideas would be\n\n* Has visited the site in the last 30 days\n* Has performed at least *x* actions in the last 30 days (actions would be new posts or edits, maybe also voting and commenting)\n* Was active at least once before (to filter out new users, this statistic should show the people who stick around)\n\nI've create [a very basic SEDE query that shows the number of active users (posted at least once in the last 30 days)](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/1779/number-of-active-users-with-1-post-in-last-30-days) and [here is another query from Sklivvz](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/112331/number-of-active-users-with-1-post-in-last-30-days). They give very different results, probably some error in my query. Though more interesting would be the time\\-dependence of that number, but my SQL knowledge is not sufficient for that query.\n\nOne might also split the statistic into active users and passive users, who only read the site, but do so regularly.\n\nThis statistic would be most interesting for beta sites, so a SEDE query would be not possible. Integration with the moderator tools, so that the mods could see the number of active users over time would be most useful.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I fully support this request. Since the \"avid user\" stats on Area51 only look at rep threshold and you get 100/200 points for free for associating an account, sites usually end up with several users with 200\\+ rep (which you can easily get from two questions/answers in a private beta), who have all but stopped participating on the site.\n\nI noticed this trend on [gardening.SE](https://gardening.stackexchange.com/ \"Desperate times call for desperate ways to increase visits\"), where Area51 lists 89 users as \"avid\", but only a handful actively contributed to the site. So I dug up some info using the API (that's the only way to access info for beta sites) and [compiled some stats](https://gardening.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231/folks-we-need-to-grow-got-fertilizers). Only about 2\\.4% (13 users) of the user base (533 users) accounted for more than 1/2, 2/3 and 1/4 of upvotes, answers and questions respectively. Looking at the \"last login\" date on the \"avid users\", I could see that a good number of them hadn't logged in for a while (this info wasn't shared in the meta post).\n\nWhile I was not completely shocked by the results, it certainly was very illuminating and definitely something that would be nice to have in the mod analytics page. It helps to visualize quickly if the active user base is growing or shrinking or staying flat and how much of activity is generated by them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statistics would be most useful for evaluating the health of a Stack Exchange site, particularly for beta sites?\n\nA) Total number of registered users\nB) Number of users with reputation above a certain threshold\nC) Number of new users in the last 30 days\nD) Number of users who have performed at least one action (post, edit, vote, or comment) in the last 30 days\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A (total registered users) is considered a useless statistic as it doesn't indicate active participation. Many registered users may never return to the site.\n\nOption B (users above a reputation threshold) doesn't necessarily reflect current activity, as users with high reputation may have stopped contributing.\n\nOption C (new users in 30 days) doesn't provide information on whether these users continue to engage with the site after initial registration.\n\nOption D is the most useful for evaluating site health because it shows the number of actively engaged users within a recent timeframe.

Most 802\\.1q enabled switches (including the 5505\\) will allow you to define ports that have 802\\.1q tagging turned on or off and what default vlan untagged packets belong to. You can define ports that have multiple VLANs enabled so long as tagging is enabled on that port. The short of it is, if the 5505 is your only switch (small network to be VLANing...) you probably don't need to change anything, but assuming you have other switches, make sure all ports connected to between them and the 5505 have tagging on and that they are a member of any VLANs you want the 5505 to see/pass over the VPN. For instance, I have 3 VLANs, and on my primary switch, I have a trunk port defined that is a member of all 3 VLANs and has tagging turned on and untagged packets (though it receives none) are by default a member of vlan 1\\. The ASA5505 then is connected to that port and thus receives all necessary traffic from my switch on any of the VLANs. Of course due to the nature of switching, traffic between PCs on a switch does not need to traverse to other switches/the 5505\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company has an existing VPN between a Cisco ASA 5505 and an 870 router. They've recently added VLANs to the network on the 5505 side but are having trouble getting devices on these VLANs to communicate with devices on the 870 network, which has no VLANs. What is the most appropriate solution to enable communication between the VLANs and the non-VLAN network?\n\nA) Implement a PFSense router to handle routing before traffic reaches the ASA\nB) Configure 802.1q tagging on the appropriate ports of the 5505 and any connected switches\nC) Remove all VLANs from the 5505 side to match the 870 network configuration\nD) Replace the 870 router with a newer model that supports VLANs\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate solution is to configure 802.1q tagging on the relevant ports of the 5505 and any connected switches. This allows the ASA 5505 to receive and process traffic from multiple VLANs without requiring additional hardware. By ensuring that the ports connecting the switches to the 5505 have tagging enabled and are members of the necessary VLANs, traffic can be properly segmented and routed between the VLANs and the non-VLAN network on the 870 side. This approach utilizes the existing hardware capabilities and doesn't require significant changes to the network architecture."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/11", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/49429", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/8919/"], "docs_id": 49429, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> The city of Rome has passed a new law to prevent cruelty to animals.\n>  \"The civilization of a city can be measured by this.

Rotate the diagram 45 degrees and place the vertex at the origin of the Cartesian plane, so that it lies above the graph of $y \\= \\\\lvert x\\\\rvert$.

In a sense, this isn't a question about Kerov\u2013Virshik at all, but a question about which interesting statistics of irreducible characters can be read off the shape of the Young diagram.\n\nThere are some tautological answers: for instance, if $f(\\\\chi)$ is the height of the first column of $\\\\chi$, then I guess Kerov\\-Virshik shows that\n\n$$\\\\frac{f(\\\\chi)}{\\\\sqrt n}$$\n\nis very probably very close to 2 as $n$ gets large (if I did this computation right \u2014 in any event it concentrates around a fixed value). But I don't really have in mind any representation\\-theoretic meaning for $f(\\\\chi)$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't a very general answer, but it is a convenient and significant one. You can read off the typical dimension of a random representation, by the hook length formula. Of course it is not as simple as, oh here's a formula, because you have to check whether the formula is stable. However, the hook\\-length formula is a factorial divided by a product of hook lengths. So you can check that the logarithm of the formula is indeed statistically stable. Up to normalization, it limits to a well\\-behaved integral over the Kerov\\-Vershik shape.\n\n---\n\nThe dimension of a group representation is of course $\\\\chi(1\\)$, the trace of the identity. Given the nice behavior of this statistic in a random representation, it is natural to ask about the typical value of $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ for some other type of permutation $\\\\sigma$. Two problems arise. First, $\\\\sigma$ isn't really one type of permutation, but rather some natural infinite sequence of permutations. Second, the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama formula for $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$, and probably any fully general rule, isn't statistically stable. The Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule is a recursive alternating sum; in order to apply it to a large Plancherel\\-random representation you would have to know a lot about the local statistics of its tableau, and not just its shape. For instance, suppose that $\\\\sigma$ is a transposition. Then the MN rule tells you to take a certain alternating sum over rim dominos of the tableau $\\\\lambda$. (The sign is positive for the horizontal dominos and negative for the vertical dominos.) I suspect that there is a typical value for $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ when $\\\\sigma$ is a transposition, or probably any permutation of fixed type that is local in the sense that a transposition is local. But this would use an elaborate refinement of the Kerov\u2013Vershik theorem, analogous to the local central limit theorem augmented by a local difference operator, and not just the original Kerov\u2013Vershik.\n\nHowever, I did find another character limit in this spirit that is better behaved. In [On the number of rim hook tableaux](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02355806 \"J Math Sci 87, 4118\u20134123 (1997)\"), Fomin and Lulov established a product formula for the number of $r$\\-rim hook tableaux, which is also $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ when $\\\\sigma$ is a \"free\" permutation consisting entirely of $r$\\-cycles (and no fixed points or cycle lengths that are factors of $r$). This includes the important case of fixed\\-point\\-free involutions. If $\\\\sigma$ acts on $mr$ letters, then according to them, the number of these is\n$$\\\\chi\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\sigma) \\= \\\\frac{m!}{\\\\prod\\_{r\\|h(t)} (h(t)/r)},$$\nwhere $h(t)$ is the hook length of the hook at some position $t$ in the shape $\\\\lambda$.\n\nHappily, this is just a product formula and not an alternating sum or even a positive sum. To approximate the logarithm of this character with an integral, you only need a mild refinement of Kerov\u2013Vershik, one that says that the hook length $h(t)$ of a typical position $t$ is uniformly random modulo $r$. (So this is a good asymptotic argument when $r$ is fixed or only grows slowly.)\n\n---\n\n**Correction:** Per a [comment](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/8776/statistics-of-irreps-of-s-n-that-can-be-read-off-the-young-diagram-and-conseque#comment12041_8778), JSE already thought of the first part of my answer, which I stated overconfidently. The estimate for $\\\\log \\\\chi(1\\)$ (and in the other cases of course) is an improper integral, I guess, so it does not follow just from the statement of Kerov\u2013Vershik that the integral gives you an accurate estimate of the form\n$$\\\\log \\\\chi(1\\) \\= C\\\\sqrt{n}(1\\+o(1\\)).$$\nHowever, it looks like these issues have been swept away by later, stronger versions of the original Kerov\u2013Vershik result. The arXiv paper [Ivanov and Olshanki \\- Kerov's central limit theorem for the Plancherel measure on Young diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304010) establishes not just a typical limit for the dimension (and other character values), but also a central limit theorem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Kerov-Vershik theorem and related research, which of the following statements about asymptotic behavior of irreducible characters of the symmetric group Sn is most accurate?\n\nA) The dimension of a typical irreducible representation of Sn can be accurately estimated using the hook length formula applied to the limiting Kerov-Vershik curve.\n\nB) The character value for any permutation type can be directly read off from the limiting shape of the Young diagram without additional statistical information.\n\nC) The character value for a transposition can be easily computed using the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule applied to the limiting Kerov-Vershik curve.\n\nD) The character value for a permutation consisting entirely of r-cycles (where r is fixed) can be estimated using a product formula that depends only on hook lengths, requiring only mild refinements to the Kerov-Vershik theorem.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is partially true but oversimplified, as the estimation requires careful consideration of statistical stability. Option B is incorrect, as character values for general permutation types cannot be directly read off the limiting shape without additional information. Option C is false, as the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for transpositions requires detailed local statistics of the tableau, not just the overall shape. \n\nOption D is correct based on the work of Fomin and Lulov. They established a product formula for the character value of permutations consisting entirely of r-cycles, which depends only on hook lengths. This formula can be estimated using integrals over the Kerov-Vershik shape, requiring only mild refinements to the original theorem (such as the uniform distribution of hook lengths modulo r).

There are DIP and LCC versions. About $3\\.80 each from Digikey in quantity needed. \n\nAt max clock of 500 kHz you can update it at about 10,000 times per second. It's just on/off per LED but by running at say 100 brightness levels with N cycles on and 100\\-N off you get 1000 frames per second.\n\nFor 8x8x8 \\= 512 LEDs you'd need 512 / 34 \\= 16 ICs.

Digikey sells a number of their ICs but do not list this one as yet.\n\nThey say: \n\n* The AS1130 is a compact LED driver for 132 single LEDs. The devices can be programmed via an I\u00b2C compatible interface.\n\nThe AS1130 offers a 12x11 LED\\-Matrix with 1/11 cycle rate. The required lines to drive all 132 LEDs are reduced to 12 by using the cross\\-plexing feature optimizing space on the PCB. \n\nThe whole LEDMatrix driving 132 LEDs can be analog dimmed from 1 to 30mA in 256 steps (8 bit). Additionally each of the 132 LEDs can be dimmed individually with 8\\-bit allowing 256 steps of linear dimming. \n\nTo reduce CPU usage up to 36 frames can be stored with individual time delays between frames to play small animations automatically.\n\nThe AS1130 operates from 2\\.7V to 5\\.5V and features a very low shutdown and operational current. The device offers a programmable IRQ pin. Via a register it can be set on what event (CP request, Interface timeout, Error\\-detection, POR, End of Frame or End of Movie) the IRO is triggered. Also hardware scroll Function is implemented in the AS1130\\.\n\nThe device is available in a ultrasmall 20\\-pin WL\\-CSP and an easy to solder 28\\-pin SSOP package.\n\n[Product page / General details here](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led-driver/AS1130)\n\n[Data sheet here](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/Products/Lighting-Management/LED-Driver-ICs/AS1130)\n\n[http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led\\-driver/AS1130](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led-driver/AS1130)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an 8x8x8 RGB LED cube (512 LEDs total) and wants to minimize the number of driver ICs needed.

Sudden changes like these can cause momentary spikes or dips in the voltage provided by the supply, which propagate around the circuit.\n\nThe long wires usually used to distribute voltage (and carry current) to the various modules of the circuit, have inductance. The effect of inductance is to make it hard for electric current to change quickly. Think of it as like momentum/inertia of a moving object, which prevents the object's velocity from changing quickly. In a circuit which has things switching on and off quickly and frequently, causing sudden increases or decreases in current demand, that long wiring makes it difficult for the power supply and its distribution system to \"keep up\". If the power supply is suddenly asked to provide an extra 10mA for an LED for example, inductance makes it impossible for the supply to *instantly* comply. The consequence is a momentary drop in supply voltage, while the power supply and its wiring \"catches up\".\n\nThere are usually several elements connected to that same supply, and they will all \"see\" these fluctuations, and can suffer to some degree. For example, such a supply voltage disturbance might cause an audible \"pop\" in an audio system. In your circuit here, you have a very complex microcontroller and display system, in which a moderate supply disturbance could flip a memory bit or even cause a reset, or any number of glitches.\n\nThe presence of capacitance between power supply rails acts as a short\\-term reservoir of energy, able to supply extra current when demand spikes suddenly (and temporarily), or absorb excess energy when demand drops suddenly. This has the effect of \"smoothing out\" the potential difference between the two supply rails, keeping that voltage much steadier than it would be without the capacitors.\n\nCapacitor C10, to the left of the 7805 regulator in your circuit, performs this function. That regulator is very good at preventing voltage disturbances at its input from reaching its output, but not *that* good. C10 lends a helping hand to the regulator, so that severe fluctuations in voltage (from an essentially untrusted 12V source) are quenched to some degree prior to regulation by the 7805\\.\n\nOn the output side of the regulator, you also have capacitor C9, which performs a similar function, on behalf of the the circuitry *following* the regulator. But C9 also has a second purpose. The 7805 (especially older models) actually *requires* some capacitance across its output in order to be stable. Without at least a few microfarads there, it's possible for the regulator output to oscillate, which can be devastating to any sensitive circuitry connected to it. All regulator datasheets tell you the minimum (and sometimes maximum) capacitance that can/should be present across its output.\n\nFat electrolytic capacitors, like those 470\u03bcF devices C9 and C10, are good at accommodating moderately fast changes in current demand, but often you will also find much smaller (1nF to 100nF) capacitors across the supply too. These would be present to mitigate really fast spikes and dips.\n\nThe actual values and construction of these capacitors would be chosen according to the conditions they are expected to operate under. 470\u03bcF seems excessive to me, for such a small system, but it could be that the designers are anticipating that you will be adding additional loads, perhaps badly behaved ones like relays or motors, later on. Typical values to find immediately either side of a regulator such as the 7805 would range from 10\u03bcF to 220\u03bcF, depending on the expected current through the regulator, and the nature of the loads it is supplying. Again, the datasheet usually provides recommendations for choosing capacitor values.\n\nIf we don't know what the source of 12V is (at the regulator's input), a large capacitance there (well above 220\u03bc) is not uncommon, since we have no idea of how clean that supply is. However, if you knew that the 12V supply was very clean, and very stable, you could probably reduce C10 to 10\u03bcF. Lower value capacitors are physically smaller and less expensive, which might be important to you.\n\nIt's difficult to say how big these capacitors should be, because every application and regulator has its quirks and idiosyncrasies, but values you choose for C9 and C10 here would range from tens to hundreds of microfarads, for current demands ranging from tens to hundreds of milliamps. That's a really \"ballpark\" guideline though."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of electronic circuits, particularly those with digital components, what is the primary purpose of capacitors placed near voltage regulators like the 7805?\n\nA) To increase the overall voltage output of the regulator\nB) To act as a short-term energy reservoir, smoothing out voltage fluctuations\nC) To reduce the temperature of the voltage regulator\nD) To amplify the current flowing through the circuit\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Capacitors placed near voltage regulators, such as the 7805, serve as short-term energy reservoirs. Their primary purpose is to smooth out voltage fluctuations caused by sudden changes in current demand from various components in the circuit. These capacitors help maintain a steady voltage supply by providing extra current during demand spikes and absorbing excess energy when demand drops suddenly. This is especially important in digital circuits where components frequently switch on and off, causing rapid changes in current draw. The presence of these capacitors helps prevent voltage disturbances that could potentially cause issues like memory bit flips, system resets, or other glitches in sensitive microcontroller systems.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because capacitors do not increase the overall voltage output of the regulator. The voltage regulator determines the output voltage.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while capacitors may have a minor effect on temperature, their primary purpose is not to reduce the regulator's temperature.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because capacitors do not amplify current.

In measure theory, for a function (in this case, our random variable X) to be measurable, the preimage of every measurable set in the codomain (E) must be measurable in the domain (\u03a9).

I originally had intended only to scrape down the popcorn finish and have it skim coated, so I did not initially try and remove the molding. Once I got down to the original plaster and saw the extent of the repairs that would be needed, I decided it was going to be more cost effective to just replace it. I had already draped the room in plastic from the molding down, and it was looking tough to get a pry bar in there, so I left it figuring I could remove the majority of the ceiling and then remove it when I had access from above.\n\nWell now I have that access, but it still looks to be a challenge:\n\n* It is 85 years old, and while it's in great aesthetic condition, in reality, the wood is dried and quite fragile. If I try to remove it, I'm likely to end up damaging some pieces.\n* The bottom portion of the molding is flush with the plaster walls and it is nailed directly into the lath, maybe even glued? When I tried to gently pry it off, the whole plaster surface moved along with the molding.\n\nSo given this, I'm wondering if I can get away with installing the drywall *without* removing the molding? There is 3/4\" of space between the joists and the molding, so 1/2\" drywall would fit fine, and due to slight unevenness in the joists I need to shim down about 1/4\" anyway.\n\nIs this a terrible idea, or does anybody have tricks for gently removing old crown molding from plaster? It would be easier to hang the drywall with the molding off, as I could strap the ceiling and shim the strapping. As is, if I did this I guess I would have to shim the joists themselves with plywood strips.\n\nEDIT: The crown molding is stained oak, which means pretty much any nick shows and damage of any substantial size is tough to re\\-stain to the right color. I am pretty attached to it, so I'd prefer to keep it intact.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Go ahead and place the drywall over the top edge of the crown moulding. Sounds like the wall was already re\\-plastered with it in place. If you tried to remove it, you may end up re\\-doing the walls as well. Even forgetting that, it's almost impossible to remove moulding without sustaining some loss. Without replacement material available, removal with intents of preservation is extremely risky, especially with stain grade material. You don't want to go there.\n\nIf your joists were flat, you'd still only need to shim down the first 4 feet or so along the walls, no one will see the resulting slight slope. Keep this in mind when planning your shims. It doesn't have to be perfectly flat, unless that gives you pleasure. You also don't need to shim to completely fill the gap. An 1/8\" gap makes a clean shadow line that is not detrimental (assuming it is perfectly uniform) at all. It also makes finishing easier. The taped joints of drywall are normally not perfectly flat, despite the tapered edges. There is a slight bulge which is usually invisible. But against straight moulding, depending on the profile, this bulge may be visible. You might consider grinding down the edge tapers at the board corners against the wall so the joint tape can be completely buried and the yet the joint against the moulding can still be perfectly flat."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When replacing a failing plaster ceiling with drywall in a room with existing crown molding, what is the recommended approach according to the expert advice?\n\nA) Remove the crown molding entirely before installing the drywall, then reinstall it afterwards.\nB) Install the drywall over the top edge of the crown molding without removing it.\nC) Cut the crown molding in half horizontally to allow for easier drywall installation.\nD) Replace the crown molding with a new, more flexible material that can be easily removed and reinstalled.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The expert advises to \"Go ahead and place the drywall over the top edge of the crown moulding.\" This approach is recommended because:\n1. Removing old crown molding, especially stained oak, is likely to cause damage and is difficult to repair or match.\n2.

On the first glance, I was thinking it should be a phrasal verb but it didn't correlate with the sentence meaning. I found out that it is an adjective with the meaning: \"Unable or unwilling to put up with something any longer\".\n\nIt seems to be a compound adjective greatly explained here \\- [https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Compound\\-Adjectives.htm](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Compound-Adjectives.htm), like a combination of a past participle and a preposition.\n\nNow, I'm in a mess \\- what the difference between compound adjectives like that and phrasal verbs.\n\nDo you know any other compound adjectives that resemble phrasal verbs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A phrasal verb can be described as an action, such as \n I don't want to see him because he will (look down on) me.\nwhereas you would never say \n I don't want to see him because he will (feed me up).\n\nThe phrasal verb focuses on the **process** regardless of the result, but the compound adjective is wholly concerned with the **current condition**, regardless of the process by which that condition was achieved. There is certainly some grey area involved in the distinction.\n\"Fed up\" is an interesting clear case in which it would never be used as a verb. To turn that phrase into a verb would require a statement such as \"He always gets me fed up\" which requires a completely separate verb.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that a phrasal verb, whether used passively or actively, automatically leads the statement to an implied or stated subject. \n(He was looked down on) has no subject doing the looking, but implies that a specific subject did exist that did indeed look down on him, and therefore is a phrasal verb in past participle form.\n\n(He was pooped out) also has no subject doing the pooping, but contrary to the first example, no subject is needed. The fact is that he had no energy, whether or not anything could be identified to have made him that way. This is therefore a compound adjective."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the difference between a compound adjective like \"fed up\" and a phrasal verb?\n\nA) Compound adjectives always consist of a past participle and a preposition, while phrasal verbs do not.\n\nB) Phrasal verbs focus on the current condition, while compound adjectives focus on the process.\n\nC) Compound adjectives describe a state without implying a specific subject, while phrasal verbs imply or require a subject who performed the action.\n\nD) Phrasal verbs can only be used as verbs, while compound adjectives can be used as both adjectives and verbs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key difference between compound adjectives like \"fed up\" and phrasal verbs lies in their focus and implication of a subject. Compound adjectives describe a current condition or state without necessarily implying a specific subject that caused that state. For example, \"He was fed up\" describes his condition without needing to specify who or what made him feel that way. \n\nOn the other hand, phrasal verbs, even when used in passive form, imply or require a subject who performed the action. For instance, \"He was looked down on\" implies that someone specific did the looking down, even if that subject isn't explicitly stated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all compound adjectives follow this structure. Option B reverses the actual relationship between phrasal verbs and compound adjectives. Option D is incorrect because compound adjectives like \"fed up\" cannot be used as verbs without additional words (e.g., \"to get fed up\")."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/23", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1136524", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/938555/"], "docs_id": 1136524, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm running Ubuntu 18\\.04 and using the Budgie Desktop Environment, if I decide to upgrade to 19\\.04 will I lose the customisation I made of that desktop environment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can't upgrade from 18\\.04 (LTS) to 19\\.04 directly, you will have to upgrade to 18\\.10 first, then to 19\\.04\\.

This allows layers with similar prefixes to be grouped together, which is the main objective of the script. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as the line doesn't create new layers, rename existing ones, or add prefixes to layer names - it only generates group names based on existing layer names."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/02/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/215375", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/43008/"], "docs_id": 215375, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Magento CE 2\\.2\\.3 release notes says Support has been added for Elasticsearch 5\\.x\n\nAfter installing and configuring Elastic Search I cannot work out how to have this option available in the admin console.\n\nIt should show up under Stores \\> Catalog \\> Catalog \\> Catalog Search \\> Search Engine\n\nAt the moment only MySQL is available.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **That means now we can Use Elasticsearch software version 5\\.x with magento 2\\.2\\.3**\n\nin previous version we can only use **Elasticsearch software version 2\\.x** \n\n**But that does't mean , they have added Magento 2 Elasticsearch(Commerce) module in Open Source(Community Version)**\n\n**Its still only available with Commerce Version (Enterprise Version).**\n\n> **So based on the release notes of open Source 2\\.2\\.3 \\- Now onwards if you installed any third party elasticsearch extension, you can use\n>  Elasticsearch Software version 5\\.X with it.**\n\nTo check the difference refer this 2\\.1 release notes link \\- [http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2\\.1/config\\-guide/elasticsearch/es\\-overview.html](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-overview.html)\n\nTo check the difference refer this 2\\.2 release notes link \\- [http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2\\.2/release\\-notes/ReleaseNotes2\\.2\\.3CE.html](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.2.3CE.html)\n\n**UPDATE :** \n\n**Magento has updated release notes and remove that elastic search support note from open source 2\\.2\\.3 here is the link** \\-[http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2\\.2/release\\-notes/ReleaseNotes2\\.2\\.3CE.html](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.2.3CE.html)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento CE 2.2.3, what does the added support for Elasticsearch 5.x mean for users of the Community Edition?\n\nA) Elasticsearch 5.x can now be selected as a search engine option in the admin console under Stores > Catalog > Catalog > Catalog Search > Search Engine\nB) The Elasticsearch module is now included in the Community Edition, but must be manually enabled\nC) Third-party Elasticsearch extensions can now utilize Elasticsearch software version 5.x\nD) Elasticsearch 5.x is now the default search engine for Magento CE 2.2.3\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The added support for Elasticsearch 5.x in Magento CE 2.2.3 does not mean that the Elasticsearch module is included in the Community Edition. It simply means that if a user installs a third-party Elasticsearch extension, that extension can now use Elasticsearch software version 5.x. The Elasticsearch module remains a feature of the Commerce (Enterprise) version only. The release notes were later updated to remove the mention of Elasticsearch support in the open source version, further clarifying this point.

Given the following tag usage data:\n\n- \"block\" (27 questions)\n- \"blocking\" (45 questions)\n- \"blocked\" (25 questions)\n\nWhich approach would be most effective for tag consolidation?\n\nA) Keep all three tags separate to maintain specificity\nB) Make \"blocking\" the master tag and merge the others into it\nC) Create a new tag \"block-related\" and merge all three into it\nD) Make \"block\" the master tag and merge \"blocking\" and \"blocked\" into it\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most effective approach for several reasons:\n\n1. \"Block\" is the root form of the word and can encompass both \"blocking\" and \"blocked\" conceptually.\n2. Using \"block\" as the master tag allows for a broader category that can include questions about the action (blocking), the state (blocked), and the concept itself.\n3. This approach reduces redundancy while maintaining clarity.\n4. It follows the principle suggested in the original answer of making \"block\" the primary tag.\n5. Merging reduces the total number of tags, making the system more manageable without losing important distinctions in content.\n\nOption A would maintain the current fragmentation, B would prioritize a less versatile form, C introduces unnecessary complexity, and D provides the best balance of consolidation and clarity."}}
