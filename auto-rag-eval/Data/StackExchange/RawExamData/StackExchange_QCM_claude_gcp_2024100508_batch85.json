With this model one could select one or more polygons and create new virtual polygons from the selected set. Furthermore one could dissolve within the set, creating a result akin to merged polygons, or have disparate polygons, possibly overlapping, that identify themselves as one unit (multipart polygons in shapefile parlance). These virtual polygons are called regions. When the regions are loaded into Arcmap (or ArcEdit/View back then) they behave like an independent shapefile or feature class in terms of querying, symbolizing, etc. \n\nThe beauty of this model and what is missing from feature classes and feature datasets in the ArcGIS world, so far as I've been able to determine, is that **in regions the geometry is stored only once**. Imagine, for example, the continent of North America split into polygons depicting countries, islands, states \\& territories, counties, municipalities, etc. down to whatever level you feel like stopping at, all stored in a single feature class. (ugh, what a mess) Yet, each level has convenient handles (country, province, whatever) that can be grabbed and used as if they were independent feature classes. \n\nCoverages and Regions have their problems, they weren't left behind lightly, but they weren't all bad. Sooo, what is the ArcGIS answer to ArcInfo Regions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm one of those lucky ones (I think) that entered the GIS world at about the time coverages were being phased out. I've used them, and still do sometimes, but never had to deal with thm in the old pre\\-ArcGIS ArcInfo.\n\n**To answer your question as simply as possible, I don't believe there is anything comparable to Regions or Region sub covrages in the new geodatabase model.**\n\nHere's a link to a white paper from 2003 describing the differences between coverages and geodtabases: [ArcGIS: Working With Geodatabase Topology](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/geodatabase-topology.pdf)\n\nFrom what I've gleened from this paper, ESRI believed at that time that any benefits from th efficiency of the coverage model were not enough to continue supporting it. Thus the move to the more flexible geodatabase."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between ArcInfo Workstation's Regions model and ArcGIS's current geodatabase model?\n\nA) The geodatabase model fully replicated all functionalities of the Regions model, including storing geometry only once for multiple levels of polygons.\n\nB) ArcGIS introduced a new feature called \"Virtual Polygons\" that directly replaced the Regions model with enhanced capabilities.\n\nC) The Regions model was completely abandoned in ArcGIS, with no comparable functionality in the geodatabase model.\n\nD) While the geodatabase model is more flexible, it lacks the efficient single-geometry storage for multiple polygon levels that the Regions model offered.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that the Regions model in ArcInfo Workstation allowed for efficient storage of geometry, where multiple levels of polygons (e.g., countries, states, counties) could be stored once but accessed as if they were independent feature classes. The top answer states that there is no direct equivalent to this in the current geodatabase model. While ESRI moved to the more flexible geodatabase model, it appears they did not carry over the specific efficiency of storing geometry only once for multiple polygon levels. The correct answer reflects this loss of functionality while acknowledging the increased flexibility of the new model."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/72094", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/19/"], "docs_id": 72094, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: French is my native language and I just realized that the `#` in `C#` is the same character as for the [*diese* music character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_%28music%29) that raises a note by a half tone.\n\nAlso, As I made my music elementary class in french, I did not realized that the [C was also a musical note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), as in french we use *do*.\n\nWith a little searching, I noticed that this [link was made on purpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29#Name).\n\nSo, here is my question: Is that link obvious for English native speaker?

According to the definition, magnetic flux is the total number of magnetic field lines that pass through a chosen surface area, so how can that number be negative since after the flux is 0 (when the coil is parallel to the magnetic field lines), at that position the coil can still capture some magnetic field lines?

The equation for magnetic flux is $$ \\\\Phi \\= \\\\vec B \\\\cdot d\\\\vec A \\= BAcos\\\\theta$$, where both the magnetic flux density and the area are vectors. It is clear mathematically from the dot product that $\\\\Phi$ can be positive (when area and flux are in same relative direction) or negative( when they are in opposite directions). \n\nYour confusion comes from not taking into account that the area we choose must be directed in some way. You might think this is an unnecessary distinction. However, in order for our mathematical formulation of magnetism to be consistent it is important. \n\nTake Faradays law for example. It says that the loop in your diagram will induce an electric current in the direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux. If you claim the flux increases (positively) after the point where it is zero, then what you are saying is that the change in magnetic flux is zero at that point and hence the induced current is zero. Yet, from experiment we know this is not true. There is current and thus we must still be having a change in flux in the negative direction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A circular coil is rotating in a uniform magnetic field as shown in the diagram.

It oscillates between positive and negative values because the flux depends on the orientation of the coil relative to the field. The flux is maximum (positive) when the coil area vector is aligned with the magnetic field, zero when perpendicular, and reaches a negative maximum when the area vector points opposite to the field. This behavior is described by the equation \u03a6 = BA cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the area vector and the magnetic field.

I noticed my room was not warming up. I moved the switch to Em.Heat and still no warm air blowing in ducts. I would like to test if my thermostat is sending signals. How do I do that with the given wiring configuration? My fan is working. How do I first test with Emergency Heat? I have split system.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With that thermostat it would be easier to tell if the air handler and heat pump are working rather than the thermostat. The thermostat doesn\u2019t send a signal it closes switches just like a few automatic light switches. So you just need to see if the switches are closing. With that thermostat it may be a little difficult especially if it is not battery powered.\nTo test the air handler connect a jumper wire to the R terminal and to the G terminal. That will turn on the fan. To test the emergency heat connect a second jumper from R to W2\\. This would turn on the emergency heat. Remove the jumper from W2 and place it on Y/W1 to turn on the compressor. Placing a third jumper between R and B will energize the reversing valve and cycle between heat and coil. Whatever you do, **do not**jump anything to C or at best you will blow a fuse and at worst let the smoke out of several components. If all that works but does not work after reconnecting the thermostat it is most likely a thermostat problem. \nIf the thermostat is battery powered you could use an ohm meter to tell is each switch is closing or not. Each one of those pins on the bottom go to a terminal. Find which terminal they go to using an ohm meter. Then insert test leads into the corresponding holes in the thermostat and do the same as above except instead of different pieces turning on your ohm meter will go from OL to 0"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is troubleshooting their Honeywell T8411R thermostat and HVAC system.

In the Eoan case, the issue was ultimately \"resolved\" in `binutils`, but it's not clear to me if that was just a workaround for what was really a WSL1 issue at the core.\n\nIn any case, there are three possible solutions:\n\n* If you can, run Jammy under WSL2\\. The Linux kernel in WSL2 handles the changes to `gzip` without issue. It's just a problem in the WSL1 ELF loader.\n* Use the workaround above to replace `gzip` with a version earlier on the path that calls the \"real\" (but broken) version through `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`.\n* From [a comment](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/8219#issuecomment-1110508016) in the WSL GitHub issue, it's possible to patch the `gzip` binary to resolve the issue. I'm not a personal fan of this approach, but if you would like to try it:\n\n```\necho -en '\\x10' | sudo dd of=/usr/bin/gzip count=1 bs=1 conv=notrunc seek=$((0x189))\n\n```\n\nSince something in the toolchain is likely the culprit, this issue also seems to be showing up in:\n\n* Other distributions (reportedly Arch and almost certainly others)\n* Other binaries (reportedly Node.js)\n\nThere is reportedly a patch for the Node issue as well in that GitHub thread.\n\nPatching distribution binaries, however, is not without risk.

Or at least we differ if I've correctly understood what you're asking.\n\nIn a hydrogen atom the 1s, 2s, etc wavefunctions are (subject to various approximations) good descriptions of the single electron and have well defined angular momentums. In multielectron atoms it's convenient to think of electrons populating successive 1s, 2s, etc levels, but this is only a conceptual model and not an accurate representation. You're quite correct that while there is a well defined angular momentum for the whole atom, you cannot define the angular momentum of individual electrons.\n\nIn the old days (maybe it's still done) we'd calculate atomic structure using a Hartree\\-Fock method with individual electron wavefunctions as the basis, and as dmckee points out, atoms have spectral lines that can often be approximately thought of as exciting a specific electron between individual electron wavefunctions. However what you're really doing is labelling the whole atom as an $l,m$ state and not an individual electron."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In multi-electron atoms, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the angular momentum of individual electrons?\n\nA) Each electron occupies a pure |lm\u27e9 state with a well-defined angular momentum.\nB) The angular momentum of individual electrons can always be precisely determined using the Hartree-Fock method.\nC) Individual electrons do not have well-defined angular momenta, but the atom as a whole has a well-defined total angular momentum.\nD) The s, p, d, f orbital designations provide an exact representation of electron angular momenta in multi-electron atoms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In multi-electron atoms, the mutual repulsion between electrons orbiting the same nucleus does not commute with individual electron angular momentum operators. This means that individual electrons do not occupy pure |lm\u27e9 states and do not have well-defined angular momenta. However, the total angular momentum of the entire atom is well-defined.\n\nOption A is incorrect because electrons in multi-electron atoms do not occupy pure |lm\u27e9 states due to electron-electron interactions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the Hartree-Fock method can provide approximate wavefunctions, it does not allow for precise determination of individual electron angular momenta in multi-electron atoms.\n\nOption C is correct. It accurately describes the situation in multi-electron atoms where individual electron angular momenta are not well-defined, but the total atomic angular momentum is.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the s, p, d, f orbital designations are conceptual models and do not provide an exact representation of electron angular momenta in multi-electron atoms.

Like my website is like **schoolmanagement.com** and I provide different sub domains to different school clients like **school1\\.schoolmanagement.com** \\& **school2\\.schoolmanagement.com** but the code is the same behind both these subdomains. Both schools have different functionality or theme depending on their separate database. So I need to provide **schoolmanagement.com** for login and once my client login based on their login credential I redirect to their respective url e.g **school1\\.schoolmanagement.com**.\n\nThis is my understanding of multi tenant application. Is my understanding right? Is there any online multi\\-tenant application that I can go through?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, that's it. But [wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) is not general enough. It does not address multi\\-tier architectures or newer forms of architecture like SOA or microservices. \n\n[Multi\\-tenancy](http://samnewman.io/blog/2015/05/05/single-tenancy-vs-multi-tenancy/) is about **software systems** and **data isolation**. Some examples: \n\n* a multi\\-tier system with a unique database can be multi\\-tenant. Example: a SAP system is composed of a database backend and a couple of web application servers that expose in a scalable manner web\\-services. It is multi\\-tenant: you can add a new customer without changing the running software installation, and several customers can use the system without ever knowing about each other. The data is completely isolated (proprietary technology).\n* your system is composed of one or several processes running webservices that are exposed to different customers via different domain names (but it's still the same processes that run it on the server). The data isolation is achieved with separate databases. It's definitively multi\\-tenant.\n* a microservice system could similarly run several loosely coupled sets of webservices, each using an own micro\\-database. If needed in order to scale up, you could start new clones of the same microservices and they would via some registering feature find their peers and automatically connect to them, offering to the user the behavior of a single application. Then there are two scenarios possible:\n\t+ if, when you want to serve a new customer, you have to start a new separate set of microservices, and organize that the microservices for one customer only connect to the microservices relating to the same customer, then it's single\\-tenant.\n\t+ but if you could serve new customers using the running instances (and new microservices would only be needed for performance), then it's multi\\-tenant"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company has developed a school management system and wants to implement a multi-tenant architecture.

In this scenario, a single instance of the software application serves multiple customers (schools), which is the core principle of multi-tenancy. The use of subdomains and separate databases for each client ensures data isolation while still utilizing a shared application infrastructure. This approach allows for efficient resource utilization, easier maintenance, and scalability.\n\nOption A describes a single-tenant architecture where each client has a separate installation, which is not multi-tenancy. Option C involves creating custom applications for each client, which goes against the principle of sharing a single application instance.

Sometimes it's convenient to work in a gauge in which there is only the vector potential $\\\\vec{A}$ but no scalar potential $\\\\phi$. The following gauge transformation transforms a general pair of potentials $(\\\\vec{A},\\\\phi)$ into $(\\\\vec{A}',0\\)$, such that\n\n$$\\\\vec{A}'\\=\\\\vec{A}\\+\\\\int\\_0^t\\\\nabla\\\\phi\\\\,dt,\\\\quad \\\\phi'\\=0\\.$$\n\nThen one could work with only the vector potential $\\\\vec{A}'$ to produce both the electric field\n\n$$\\\\vec{E}\\=\\-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{A}'}{\\\\partial t}\\=\\-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{A}}{\\\\partial t}\\-\\\\nabla\\\\phi,$$\n\nand the magnetic field\n\n$$\\\\vec{B}\\=\\\\nabla\\\\times\\\\vec{A}'\\=\\\\nabla\\\\times\\\\vec{A}.$$\n\nThe above procedure seems to work generally without assuming there being no electric charge (which would produce the retarded scalar potential in Lorenz gauge). Is there a name for this $\\\\,\\\\phi\\=0\\\\,$ gauge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The gauge $\\\\phi \\= A\\_0 \\= 0$ is called Weyl gauge or temporal gauge. \n\nThis gauge is incomplete, as one can see from the definition of a gauge transformation,\n$$A\\_\\\\mu \\\\to A\\_\\\\mu \\+ \\\\partial\\_\\\\mu \\\\alpha(x).$$\nWe can still perform any gauge transformation with gauge parameter $\\\\alpha$ independent of $t$, as this keeps $A\\_0$ the same. To remove some of the residual gauge freedom we could, e.g. impose\n$$A\\_z\\|\\_{t \\= 0} \\= 0\\.$$\nThe proof this gauge can be reached is just the exact same as the proof that Weyl gauge can be reached, except with effectively one less dimension since nothing depends on $t$. At this point we are still not done, because we can still preserve both gauge conditions using any $\\\\alpha$ independent of both $t$ and $z$. So we impose the further condition\n$$A\\_y\\|\\_{t \\= z \\= 0} \\= 0$$\nleaving only $\\\\alpha$ dependent on $x$, which are removed by imposing\n$$A\\_x\\|\\_{t \\= z \\= y \\= 0} \\= 0\\.$$\nThese four conditions together are a complete gauge fixing. It's quite a mouthful, which is why you won't see it written out in textbooks too often.\n\nWhether or not you *want* to perform a complete gauge fixing is up to taste. For example, in the standard presentation of the QCD $\\\\theta$\\-vacua, one takes the incomplete gauge fixing $A\\_0 \\= 0$ and then argues there are multiple vacua $\\|n \\\\rangle$. But there is a completely equivalent presentation where one takes the complete gauge fixing I gave above (also mentioned [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/420223/why-not-regard-all-large-gauge-transformations-as-genuine-ones)), and finds a unique vacuum but the exact same physical effects.

When you take an argument of type `MyBaseDto` you're depending on abstraction which could represent any number of derived classes. But as soon as you start casting it back to specific derived types, you're now tightly coupled to each of those derived types. \n\nWhen you pass a parameter of type `MyBaseDto`, all the method should ever need to know about its type is that it is a `MyBaseDto`. As soon as you start casting it then you start to lose the benefit of strong typing. What if someone passes in the wrong `NotificationType` and as a result you try to cast `baseDto` to the wrong type? \n\nTechnically you could just change the type of the first parameter to `object` and then cast it to whatever type you expect it to be. But strong typing is supposed to ensure that you already know what type you have. And all you need to know about an object is its *declared* type \\- the type specified by the argument. \n\nIt's not a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle because that violation would occur in the class (`MyBaseDto`) and its derived classes. The problem isn't in those classes, but rather how they're being used.\n\nIn a nutshell, if receive type `A` and then start inspecting it or casting it to see if it's really derived type `B` or `C` then something has gone wrong.

The issue lies in how the objects are used, not in their inheritance hierarchy.\n\nB) is incorrect as using a base DTO class with derived classes is a common and often useful pattern in object-oriented design. The problem is not in this structure itself.\n\nC) is correct. The OnUpdateAvailable method takes a parameter of type MyBaseDto but then downcasts it to specific derived types based on the NotificationType. This violates the principle of depending on abstractions and introduces tight coupling to specific derived types.\n\nD) is incorrect. While the use of an enum might be debated in some contexts, it's not the primary issue here and doesn't inherently introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the core problem: the method is not adhering to the abstraction it declares in its parameter type, instead casting to specific derived types.

To fix this, redefine the \\note command within the custom environment.\n\nB) Beamer doesn't support custom frame environments. Use the standard \\begin{frame} and \\end{frame} commands instead.\n\nC) The \\beamer@cramped command is undefined when using custom frame environments. Initialize it in the preamble using \\makeatletter\\def\\beamer@cramped{}\\makeatother.\n\nD) Custom frame environments automatically disable note-taking features. Add the [notes=true] option to your custom frame environment definition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue arises because the \\beamer@cramped command is not properly defined when using custom frame environments. This causes compilation errors when trying to use \\note commands after a custom frame. The solution is to initialize \\beamer@cramped in the preamble using \\makeatletter\\def\\beamer@cramped{}\\makeatother. This defines the command, allowing notes to compile correctly even when using custom frame environments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because redefining the \\note command is unnecessary and wouldn't address the root cause.

The output voltage is measured across both capacitors.

During the positive half-cycle of the input, capacitor C1 charges through D1. During the negative half-cycle, C2 charges through D2. The voltages on C1 and C2 add together, resulting in a DC output voltage that is approximately twice the peak input voltage. This doubling effect can be seen in the output waveform, where the voltage across Vc1 and Vc2 reaches about double the peak of the input sine wave. The slight difference from exactly double is due to voltage drops across the diodes and any leakage in the capacitors."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/17", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1193967", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/203423/"], "docs_id": 1193967, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is, perhaps, too simple of a question for here, but I'd love it if someone helped me out.\n\nI'm just learning about arc\\- trigonometric functions (because I failed both calculus exams) and my textbook says that it's pretty obvious how to prove the following equations.

You could write a little program (in python, or anything) that re\\-applies the changes as needed.\n\nAlternatively you can include the web map as an `iframe` in another web page, minimally, where `index.html` is the qgis web map:\n\n```\n<h1>Megacorp Iframe</h1>\n<iframe src=\"index.html\">\n\n```\n\ngets you:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuVYO.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuVYO.png)\n\nbut that can be made pretty with some extra options."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You've created a webmap using qgis2web in QGIS and want to add your company logo and a title to the map.

Names are only auxiliary thing, designed to allow easier access for us humble human beings. For the service to be independent, it has to have a dedicated IP/IPv6 address.\n\nOnly HTTP was extended somewhat to give host names extended meaning. Absolutely any other protocol only gives meaning to addresses and ports. Also NAT appeared that allows several hosts to hide behind a single address; previously if you wanted the host to communicate with the Internet you had to assign some globally unique routed (public) address to it.\n\nConsequently, you can't rely on names so much, and you **absolutely** have to use different IP addresses and/or ports to direct traffic to different services. You can't distinguish anything just by names.\n\n---\n\nFor HTTP **only**, it is possible to run name\\-based reverse proxy (any will do: Nginx, Caddy, Haproxy, Apache), so all websites will be available without the need to specify port names. However, for HTTPS, you'll terminate the TLS layer on the reverse proxy, therefore you'll need to have all the globally trusted certificates and their corresponding private keys on the reverse proxy, it's natural to run it on the front end node. (With Haproxy it might be possible to also analyse the ALPN and SNI in the ClientHello and directly pass HTTPS traffic to back end servers based on name, but that's really advanced topic.)\n\nFor all other protocols the best you have is this:\n\n```\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3389 -> 192.168.1.10:3389\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3390 -> 192.168.1.20:3389\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3391 -> 192.168.1.30:3389\n\n```\n\nand so on. Notice different ports are mapped to different servers. Basically there is **no way to go around** this.\n\nWhile each of those servers can run its own VPN service, it might be better to run a single service on the front end system and provide different access (different firewall rules) to different back end servers for different clients, based on client certificate DNs. This way, after connecting to the VPN, each of them will see and use internal server addresses (192\\.168\\.1\\.x) directly without any NAT.\n\nAlso, for the SSH access you may employ SSH Jump Host configuration so it'll *appear* to the users as if they connect to the internal servers directly. For that, you create a limited user on the front end node. Each user generates a SSH key and you install these keys as usual on the back end nodes. Additionally, you install this key to the front end system into that limited user's authorized\\_keys, and further limit it to only permit that connection for TCP port forwarding.

It combines the use of a reverse proxy for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, which can handle name-based routing for web services, with port forwarding for other protocols. This approach allows for:\n\n1. Efficient handling of web traffic using a single public IP address\n2. Secure termination of HTTPS connections at the front-end, centralizing certificate management\n3. Proper handling of non-HTTP protocols by mapping different public ports to internal servers\n4.

Simply because writes are often async but reads tend to be in straight line and if we are hopping across different filesystem blocks, disk seek can make it slow.

The explanation in the documentation suggests that the POLLIN event in the revents field indicates data is ready to be read. This means that when poll() is called after a read() operation, it can quickly determine that there's data available, resulting in faster execution times.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two main possible causes for the problem:\n\n---\n\nThe first, and which I'm posting more as a warning than as an actual cause in your case, is that an excessive amount of data is being printed on the console with the `System.out.println()`.\n\nI am unsure if it only occurs with NetBeans or all Development tools. But either way, it requires a truly absurd amount of printing for it to be triggered, and i doubt you have that many files loading.\n\nAnyways, if your intent with the `System.out.println(\"Loading \"+original+\"...\");` line is for a permanent/production logging, rather than something you've put on code just temporarily for development/debug purposes, then you are better off with a proper `Logger`. You can read a TL;DR version of instructions in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16448421/1253136), and you can read further, including the official documentation, through the links provided there.\n\n---\n\nThe other cause, which is quite certainly your's, is that you are having too much data loaded at the same time. The solutions are to either:\n\n1. Scale down the images (make thumbnails), and only show the full\\-size version for the selected image. Please note tough, that this is a fast solution method, and is **not recommended!** As it might still be too much for the system to withstand.\n2. Only have the images present at visible portion of the interface loaded (or the thumbnails of said images, for a combined, best solution), and load new images (and unload the others), as the interface is navigated."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When developing a photo browser application in Java that needs to handle a large number of images, which approach is most recommended to avoid OutOfMemoryError exceptions?\n\nA) Create an ArrayList of BufferedImages to store all images at full resolution\nB) Use a Vector to store JPanel containers with full-sized images\nC) Implement lazy loading with thumbnails, only loading full-sized images when selected\nD) Increase the Java heap space to accommodate all images in memory\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A and B both involve loading all images at full resolution into memory, which can quickly lead to OutOfMemoryError exceptions when dealing with a large number of images. \n\nOption D, while it might temporarily solve the issue, doesn't address the root cause and is not scalable.\n\nOption C is the most recommended approach. By implementing lazy loading with thumbnails, you only load the full-sized images when they are actually needed (i.e., when selected by the user). This significantly reduces memory usage, as you're only keeping smaller thumbnail images in memory for the list view. Full-sized images are loaded on-demand, which is much more efficient and scalable.\n\nThis approach combines the two recommended solutions mentioned in the documentation: scaling down the images for the list view (thumbnails) and only loading the full-sized version for the selected image.

According to the documentation, the Fedora installer has a two-stage process. In the first stage, it asks which disks to use overall, without showing individual partitions. This can be confusing and may seem dangerous, but it's actually safe. The user should select the disk and proceed to the next section, where they will be able to work with individual partitions.

How can I properly distribute my work? How can I make it easy for others? How can I move beyond \"here's the zip\" releases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the real world you really want to come as close to just hitting a button and having everything be automated as you can. If you are installing yourself it's worth the effort because of the time it saves and because you want to make it very hard to make a mistake with live software. If you aren't then it's worth the effort because in almost all cases few people will deal with a difficult installation process.\n\nThis can be quite a lot of work but it's conceptually pretty straight forward. You have to write code that verifies that the transitive closure of all dependencies are satisfied and either fix anything missing or have a good error message. If there are installation options that you can't know in advance you have to support setting those via a UI or script or both. You have to play nicely with whatever standard installation mechanism(s) exist in your environment. \n\nDependencies might not just be files, but might be things like making sure windows registry entries the program relies on are present, configuring a web server for the program, etc.\n\nBasically you have to do programatically everything someone would do by hand, handling all the different possible scenarios.\n\nAutomated build is a pretty self explanatory term. A lot of times the build doesn't get quite all the love it needs, and the build process is written in a document with a lot of steps. It's generally worth the effort to have some form of configuration driving a completely automated script. That's an automated build. Usually part of the build is running automated tests to make sure that not only does the build produce a program, but that at least the tested parts of the program actually work.\n\nContinuous integration isn't feasible without an automated build, which is a big reason an automated build is worth doing. It means that the build gets run automatically using some scheme (like \"whenever new code has been checked in since I finished the last build I was working on\"). Generally a big part of the value of this is that the build runs automated tests, so if code changes break some distant dusty corner of the program you find out automatically and fairly quickly. There may be some value in just knowing it all still compiles though.\n\nDistributing your work and making it easy for others would involve making an installer and following whatever conventions your audience might expect, like putting in an app store, or a source code repository. There are a lot of tools in various environments that, given a name, go find code for you and install it. Your code can participate in that if you follow all the rules needed for those tools to work.\n\nI've been incredibly general because the gory details vary quite a bit in different environments, so a specific answer would depend greatly on exactly what you are doing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the purpose and benefits of continuous integration in software development?\n\nA) It's a method of manually testing code changes before merging them into the main codebase.\n\nB) It's an automated process that regularly builds, tests, and integrates code changes, helping to detect issues early and maintain software quality.\n\nC) It's a technique for distributing software to end-users through app stores and repositories.\n\nD) It's a way to create detailed documentation for manual build processes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Continuous integration is an automated process that regularly builds, tests, and integrates code changes. It requires an automated build system and typically includes running automated tests. The main benefits are:\n\n1. Early detection of issues: By automatically building and testing code changes frequently, problems are caught earlier in the development process.\n\n2. Maintaining software quality: Regular integration and testing help ensure that the codebase remains in a working state.\n\n3. Increased efficiency: Automation reduces manual effort and the likelihood of human error in the build and test process.\n\n4. Faster feedback: Developers get quick feedback on their changes, allowing for faster iterations and problem-solving.\n\nOption A is incorrect because continuous integration is automated, not manual.

This approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. It helps manage expansion in larger areas. The living space (250 sq ft) is significantly larger than each bedroom (150 sq ft), and larger rooms require larger expansion gaps.\n\n2. It reduces the risk of bowing that can occur when a continuous floor expands differently in various areas.\n\n3.

A *factor* is a von Neumann algebra with a trivial center. The *center* is the intersection with the commutant. A *von Neumann algebra* is an algebra of bounded operators on an Hilbert space, closed by taking bicommutant and dual. Here, $R$ is the hyperfinite $II\\_{1}$ factor. $R^{G}$ is the subfactor of $R$ containing all the elements of $R$ invariant under the natural action of the finite group $G$. In its [thesis](http://www.ams.org/books/memo/0237/), Vaughan Jones shows that, for all finite group $G$, this action exists and is unique (up to outer conjugacy, see [here](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/%7Eu0018768/artikels/bourbaki-popa.pdf) p8\\), and the subfactor $R^{G} \\\\subset R$ completely characterizes the group $G$.

It is more an exercise which I posed myself in mathematical/statistical modelling.\nI have some Whatsapp data of a chat with someone. I want to find a mathematical model to describe the data. I have manually cut the chat into meaningful conversation pieces. So far I have the following Ansatz:\nLet $t\\_{j,i}$ be the time at which something is said by Person A or Person B in the whatsapp\\-chat at conversation j.\nWe have the following \"waiting times\":\n$0\\=t\\_{11}\\<t\\_{12}\\<\\\\cdots\\<t\\_{1,a\\_1}\\<t\\_{2,1}\\<t\\_{2,2}\\<\\\\cdots\\<t\\_{2,a\\_2}\\<\\\\cdots\\<t\\_{n,1}\\<\\\\cdots\\<t\\_{n,a\\_n}$\nSo we have $n$ \"conversations\" in this chat by two people. Now my modeling Ansatz is that we have between each conversation a pause $P\\_j$:\n\n$t\\_{1,a\\_1}\\+P\\_1 \\= t\\_{2,1}$\n\n$t\\_{2,a\\_2}\\+P\\_2 \\= t\\_{3,1}$\n\n$\\\\cdots$\n\n$t\\_{n\\-1,a\\_{n\\-1}}\\+P\\_{n\\-1} \\= t\\_{n,1}$\n\nI have verified with the Kolmogorov\\-Smirnov Test all my assumptions concerning distribution of variables. \nNow we have \n\n$P\\_j \\\\sim Exp(\\\\lambda\\_P)$\n\n$d\\_{j,i} \\= t\\_{j,i\\+1}\\-t\\_{j,i} \\\\sim Exp(\\\\lambda\\_d)$ \"interarrival times\"\n\n$a\\_j \\\\sim Pois(\\\\lambda\\_a)$\n\nNow one could think of this as a \"nested Poisson process\", by which I mean, that we have a Poisson Process which governs the distributions of the conversations, and in each conversation we have a homogeneous Poisson process. Two conversations might have different parameters.\n\nOk, so in reality we can not observe when one conversation ends and when it starts. So the question is, given the data $t\\_1 \\< \\\\cdots \\< t\\_m$ is it possible to calibrate the above model to find out how many conversations there are in this chat and when a conversation ends / starts, or are there to many parameters in the model, which need to be estimated?\n\nIf it is of help: We also observe at each timestamp who is chatting (Person A / Person B).\n\nWe have \n\n$t\\_{n,a\\_n} \\= \\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^n P\\_j \\+ \\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^n\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{a\\_j\\-1}d\\_{j,i}$\n\nFrom this I have computed the expected value and the variance of $t\\_{n,a\\_n}$:\n\n$E(t\\_{n,a\\_n}) \\= n/\\\\lambda\\_P \\+ n(\\\\lambda\\_a\\-1\\)/\\\\lambda\\_d$\n\n$Var(t\\_{n,a\\_n}) \\= n/\\\\lambda\\_P^2 \\+ n(\\\\lambda\\_a\\-1\\)/\\\\lambda\\_d^2$ \n\nNow the question is, given the data $t\\_1\\<\\\\cdots\\<t\\_m$ how to estimate the parameters: $n, \\\\lambda\\_P, \\\\lambda\\_d, \\\\lambda\\_a$?\n\n**EDIT: (by suggestion of Bj\u00f8rn Kjos\\-Hanssen):**\n\nOne idea, as suggested by Bj\u00f8rn Kjos\\-Hanssen is to plot the differences (pauses) and then to cut them off at the mean of pauses:\n\n[![diff-times](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsGGw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsGGw.png)\n\nThe number of times the pauses are above the mean, could be estimated as $n$ the number of conversations.\nSo to make it more precise let $d\\_i \\= t\\_{i\\+1}\\-t\\_i$ $i\\=1,\\\\cdots,m\\-1$\nThen $\\\\widehat{d} \\= 1/(m\\-1\\) \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{m\\-1} d\\_i$.

It's a simple and intuitive method that doesn't require complex algorithms or assumptions.\n\nOption A, while theoretically possible, would be computationally intensive and difficult to implement given the nested structure of the model.\n\nOption C introduces an assumption of a fixed n that isn't necessary given the method described in the question.\n\nOption D introduces a new model (hidden Markov model) that wasn't part of the original formulation and might be unnecessarily complex for this situation.\n\nThe method in option B allows for a straightforward estimation of n, which can then be used to estimate the other parameters using the formulas provided in the model description. This approach is consistent with the procedure outlined in the question and provides a practical way to estimate all required parameters."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/12", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/186761", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/63715/"], "docs_id": 186761, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One of my team members, a junior programmer, has impressive programming skills for his level of experience. \n\nAnd during code reviews, I believe in emphasizing learning, not pointing out mistakes.\n\nBut should junior programmers be involved in code reviews for more senior programmers? Or should code reviews be attended only by programmers with corresponding experience?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary purpose of a code review is to find defects or potential problems. The required participants in the review should be the people who are best suited to identify these problems, regardless of their title or seniority.\n\nAs an example, if an application is being developed in Python and the junior engineer has more experience with the Python language than the senior engineer who wrote the code, then they might be a valuable asset in pointing out alternative methods of doing something, but they may also have less knowledge of the system as a whole.\n\nBeyond the experience in the tools and technologies, also consider experience in the application domain. Someone with 20 years of experience but only 1 or 2 in the financial industry may be helped by having an overall less experienced developer with only 5 years of experience all in the financial industry review his work.\n\nInviting less experienced staff members to observe and participate as much as possible the code review process may also be beneficial to allow them to learn a code base, ask questions, and learn about what is expected of them in not only code reviews, but in the code that they produce. However, you probably don't want too many people involved (focusing instead on the people who can fully support the code review and its purpose) in the process.\n\nThis really applies to any kind of review \\- requirements, design, code..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best represents the ideal approach to involving junior programmers in code reviews of more senior programmers' work?\n\nA) Junior programmers should never be involved in reviewing senior programmers' code to maintain hierarchy and respect.\n\nB) Junior programmers should only observe code reviews silently to learn, without actively participating.\n\nC) Junior programmers should be involved in code reviews based on their relevant expertise, regardless of their overall experience level.\n\nD) Code reviews should always include all team members, regardless of their experience or expertise, to promote inclusivity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that the primary purpose of code reviews is to find defects and potential problems, and the participants should be those best suited to identify these issues, regardless of title or seniority. It specifically mentions that junior programmers with relevant expertise (e.g., in a particular programming language or industry domain) can provide valuable input in code reviews of more senior programmers' work.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the document's stance on valuing expertise over hierarchy. Option B is too limiting, as the document suggests that junior programmers can actively participate, not just observe. Option D goes too far in the other direction, as the document recommends focusing on those who can fully support the code review's purpose, rather than including everyone regardless of their ability to contribute effectively."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/20", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/245071", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/12430/"], "docs_id": 245071, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the (grammatical or syntax) term for adjectives you can use them in two ways, with 'not' or without 'not' to say the same thing (more or less).

This rhetorical device involves making an understatement by using a negative expression to emphasize a positive meaning. For example, saying \"not bad\" to mean \"good,\" or \"not uncommon\" to mean \"frequent.\"\n\nA) Hyperbole is incorrect.

The table shows that crosstalk attacks became a major focus of research starting around 2009, with multiple studies each year from 2009 onwards. For example, we see crosstalk-related papers by Skorin-Kapov (2009), Wu (2005, 2006), Furdek (2010, 2011, 2013), Peng (2011), Winzer (2011), and others.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there were some early 2000s studies on eavesdropping (e.g., Stok 2002), the topic continued to be researched in later years (e.g., Nadarajah 2007, Prucnal 2009).\n\nOption C is incorrect as gain competition attacks were not extensively studied throughout the period.

Using two separate arrays allows for maintaining the paired data (epoch and values) while still enabling efficient sorting and insertion. Binary search (std::lower_bound) provides a good balance of performance for finding the correct insertion point, especially when dealing with mostly-sorted real-time data. This approach also satisfies the requirement of providing raw pointers to the data for plotting purposes.\n\nOption A is less efficient as it requires sorting the entire container after each insertion.

The 3 subnets are connected using layer 3 switches (10\\.0\\.100\\.200, 10\\.1\\.100\\.200, 10\\.2\\.100\\.200\\), all of the machines on each subnet use the layer 3 switch as it's default gateway, which then directs the traffic to the real gateway which currently is 10\\.1\\.0\\.2\n\nI have recently configured a new gateway on 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, and have begun testing this new gateway, for my client machines on the 10\\.0\\.0\\.0/16 subnet this is not an issue, I simply changed the default gateway assigned via DHCP to these machines to the new address and the traffic went out through the new gateway instead of going to the layer 3 switch.\n\nI want to test this on another site as well, as we have different teams in each building who need access to different websites, and I want to make sure before we switch everything over that each team can access what they need to do their work.\n\nSo on a Windows workstation on the 10\\.2\\.0\\.0/16 network I tried setting the default gateway of the machine to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, I checked where the traffic went to and it still went out through the old gateway (using tracert to 8\\.8\\.8\\.8 it gets there but through the old gateway, using tracert 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, it reaches 10\\.0\\.0\\.1\\). I believe the default gateway setting is being overridden by the static route table on the layer 3 switches.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if it possible to set a static route on the machines in question so they can direct their gateway traffic to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 and avoid it being overridden by the Layer 3 switches.\n\nI used:\n\n```\nroute add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 if 0x2\n\n```\n\nThis was accepted by Windows, but repeating my tracert tests the traffic still goes out through the old gateway. I was hoping I could do:\n\n```\nroute add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 if 0x2\nroute add 10.0.0.1 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.100.200 if 0x2\nroute add 10.0.100.200 mask 0.0.0.0 10.2.100.200 if 0x2\n\n```\n\nBut this also failed, running the second and 3rd commands Windows reported:\n\n```\nThe route addition failed: The specified mask parameter is invalid. (Destination & Mask) != Destination.\n\n```\n\n**So I know the commands I am running won't work, but is it possible to force Windows to direct its traffic through the layer 3 switches to my new gateway or am I on a fruitless search?**\n\nIf I need to alter the static routes on the layer 3 switches I don't mind doing this, I have a maintenance window planned on Sunday anyway so I can do some tinkering then. I would rather not do this during working hours, for obvious reasons.\n\nJust to clarify the links between sites, each layer 3 switch has the following connections:\n\n```\ngateway     , fibre link 1, fibre link 2\n10.0.100.200,             , 192.168.10.1\n10.1.100.200, 192.168.20.1, 192.168.10.2\n10.2.100.200, 192.168.20.2,\n\n```\n\nSo in order for my traffic to get to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 from 10\\.2\\.249\\.28 (my testing machine) it needs to go through 10\\.2\\.100\\.200 \\> 192\\.168\\.20\\.1 \\> 192\\.168\\.10\\.1 \\> 10\\.0\\.0\\.1\n\nThe layer 3 switches in question are Netgear FSM7326P and GSM7328FS.\n\n**If, as I am starting to suspect I cannot do this by setting the static routes within Windows, is it possible to define a static route for individual IP addresses on the layer 3 switches?** Since I am currently testing I only want traffic from the 3 or 4 machines I will configure for testing to go through the new gateway for now, I want all the other traffic to continue to flow as before.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A default gateway on a system defines which address on its local broadcast domain to send data for addresses which lie outside the directly connected subnets. Since 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 is outside of 10\\.2\\.0\\.0/16, a host on 10\\.2\\.0\\.0 still needs to know which address within 10\\.2\\.0\\.0 to send the packets to in order for it to be forwarded. Once the packet hits the gateway within 10\\.2\\.0\\.0, then it's up to that gateway how to handle it.\n\nCreative static routes based on access control lists may be possible, depending on your networking gear.\n\nIn my opinion, your best bet would be to connect the new router/gateway (10\\.0\\.0\\.1\\) to the other subnets. Depending on the hardware you are using, you can accomplish this with either additional physical links or a mutually compatible trunking protocol. Once you have your new gateway connected to all three subnets, you will be able to manually connect the other computers to test.\n\nThat said, I'm confused as to what exactly you're testing that requires all three of these /16s to be able choose multiple gateways.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to succeed?\n\nA) Set the default gateway to 10.0.0.1 on the test machines in the 10.2.0.0/16 subnet\nB) Add a static route on the test machines using the command: route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1\nC) Configure access control lists (ACLs) on the Layer 3 switches to route traffic from specific IP addresses to the new gateway\nD) Connect the new gateway (10.0.0.1) directly to all three subnets using additional physical links or trunking protocols\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) This approach won't work because 10.0.0.1 is outside the 10.2.0.0/16 subnet, and the Layer 3 switches will override this setting.\nB) Adding a static route on Windows machines won't bypass the Layer 3 switch routing.\nC) While this might be possible depending on the network equipment, it's not guaranteed to work and could be complex to implement.\nD) This is the most reliable solution. By connecting the new gateway to all subnets, it becomes directly reachable, allowing for easier testing and routing control.

This idiom captures the sense of weariness or disgust that comes from overexposure to something, in this case, a specific food item.\n\nOption A, \"burned out on,\" typically refers to mental exhaustion from overwork rather than physical satiety from overeating.\n\nOption B, \"fed up with,\" suggests frustration or annoyance, which doesn't necessarily imply overconsumption.\n\nOption C, \"sick of,\" best matches the context provided in the documentation. It implies a temporary aversion due to overexposure or excess, which aligns with the scenario of eating too much of something and losing the desire for it.\n\nOption D, \"stuffed with,\" while related to eating, refers more to the immediate feeling of fullness after a meal rather than a longer-term aversion to a particular food.\n\nThe documentation specifically mentions that \"sick of\" can be used to express that someone has eaten too much of something and now doesn't want to eat it for some time, which perfectly fits the question's scenario."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/18", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/1267", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/150/"], "docs_id": 1267, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Rephrasing of the question slightly to address some issues.\n\nIs there are standard way of measuring load times for data, specifically sybolised data, within ArcMap?\n\nIn particular, we're comparing load times of different data formats (shapefile, SDE, file and personal geodatabases) across the network for the same (large) sets of data. We're also aiming to test speeds between ArcGIS versions.\n\nAt this point I've started hacking together a simple VB script to do some of the timing without having to sit there with a stopwatch as @matt\\-wilkie suggested. The script (thus far) can be found at <http://textsnip.com/8912ac/vb>. The script was written in ArcGIS 9\\.3 but works in 9\\.2 as well.\n\nTo use the script, copy the VB script to your mxd, and add two buttons, called \"LoadDatasets\" and \"SymboliseDatasets\". The LoadDatasets button allows the load of one or more feature classes or layers, and times the load. SymboliseDatasets checks the number of layers in the ActiveView, and if there are none, calls the load dialog (but doesn't time it). Once layers are added then the SymboliseDatasets button will symbolise all layers into 10 quantile groups based on their FIDs.\n\nI have fixed the issue of timing the rendering by adding a DoEvents after the ActiveView.Refresh\n\nIn the meantime if anyone wants to pick this script up and modify it to make it more useful I'm happy to set this question to community wiki.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We use a stopwatch and a spreadsheet, and measure (a) time from initial load to spinny\\-globe\\-refresh stops spinning, (b) time to refresh (press refresh button), (c) zoom to scale N, (d) zoom to scale NN, (f) pan. Repeat at least 3 times for each datastore. Repeat again at different times of day to account for network usage patterns by others.\n\nThe results are pretty rough and the testing labour intensive but better than nothing. A script to do the same which could be automated would be awesome. Some test runs had to be repeated more than 10 times because there was so much variability in the results, I assume from network traffic or perhaps intense fileserver disk activity.\n\nThe last time I did this, a couple of years ago, indexed shapefiles were the fastest, closely followed by file geodatabases, then SDE, and personal geodatabases dead last. This is averaged results; our SDE datastore was faster at certain scales but not overall for example. The fastest raster was ECW, which is lossy unfortunately. Fastest lossless was geotiffs with pyramids."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A GIS team is conducting performance testing of different data formats in ArcMap. They want to measure load times and rendering speeds across various scenarios. Which of the following approaches would be the MOST comprehensive and accurate method for this evaluation?\n\nA) Use a VB script that automates the loading and symbolizing of datasets, timing only the initial load process.\n\nB) Manually time the loading process with a stopwatch, focusing solely on the time it takes for the spinny-globe-refresh icon to stop.\n\nC) Implement a combination of scripted and manual timing, measuring initial load time, refresh time, zoom to different scales, and pan operations. Repeat tests multiple times at various times of day.\n\nD) Rely on the built-in performance metrics provided by ArcMap, which automatically track and report load times for different data formats.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C provides the most comprehensive and accurate method for evaluating performance across different data formats in ArcMap. This approach combines the benefits of automation (through scripting) with the nuanced observations possible through manual timing. By measuring multiple aspects of performance (initial load, refresh, zoom, pan) and repeating tests at different times, it accounts for variability due to network traffic and server load. The multiple repetitions and consideration of different times of day help ensure more reliable and representative results. This method also aligns with the described approach in the top answer, which emphasized the importance of repeated measurements and considering various performance aspects beyond just initial load time."}}
