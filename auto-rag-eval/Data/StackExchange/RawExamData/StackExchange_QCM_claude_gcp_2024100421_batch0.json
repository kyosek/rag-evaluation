However, I can't find the blaster frame (also a tier 3\\). It could just be that I need to play that mission a whole bunch more, but its making me wonder:\n\nAre some items only available in the \"event\" (ie Weapons Wednesday) missions, even though their tier is available in the standard missions? The in\\-game help suggests some cards can only be achieved by playing in the Arena, but mentions characters specifically (not promotion items).\n\nTo be super clear, is there any Tier 1,2, or 3 item that is not given though the standard promotion missions? Obviously Tier 4 and 5 items are going to be difficult to get unless you go through the event missions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sabaac Cards and the Medal of Alderaan are only in Arena Crates, so I'd say it's really rare since arena crates now only go up to Tier 3\\."

Put `appService.service` in `~/.config/systemd/system/` and remove the `User=` line. Then you can control it with:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user start appService.service\nsystemctl --user stop appService.service\n\n```\n\n2. Add a polkit rule. I think this question is very close to what you're looking for: [systemd start as unprivileged user in a group](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504806/systemd-start-as-unprivileged-user-in-a-group/557634#557634). If you are on debian/ubuntu (polkit \\< 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/service-auth.pkla\n---\n[Allow yourname to start/stop/restart services]\nIdentity=unix-user:youname\nAction=org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\nResultActive=yes\n\n```\n\nIf you are on Arch/Redhat (polkit \\>\\= 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/service-auth.rules\n---\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if (action.id == \"org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\" &&\n        subject.user == \"yourname\") {\n        return polkit.Result.YES;\n    } });\n\n```\n\n3. `sudo`. I'm not a big fan of this because `sudo` shouldn't need to rely on a `NOPASSWD:` configuration and I don't feel that it's designed to be invoked indirectly. That's what polkit is designed for.\n\n```\n/etc/sudoers.d/sysctl\n---\nyouname ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl\n\n```\n\n---\n\nIf this is for software you plan to distribute, I'd definitely go with the polkit solution and do it per group (per the linked answer). It means you don't have to hard\\-code a username, instead add whichever users you like to that group to get the functionality."

Let me assume that $E$ is modular. Then there will be some level 1 Hilbert modular form over $F$ corresponding to $E$. But my understanding is that the cohomology of $E$ will not show up in any of the \"usual suspect\" Shimura varieties associated to this situation (the level 1 Hilbert modular surface, or any Shimura curve \\[the reason it can't show up here is that a quaternion algebra ramified at precisely one infinite place must also ramify at one finite place]).\n\nIf you want a more concrete assertion, I am saying that the Tate module of $E$, or any twist of this, shouldn't show up as a subquotient of the etale cohomology of the Shimura varieties attached to $GL(2\\)$ or any of its inner forms over $F$ (my knowledge of the cohomology of Hilbert modular surfaces is poor though; I hope I have this right).\n\nBut here's the question. I have it in my head that someone once told me that $E$ (or perhaps more precisely the motive attached to $E$) should not show up in the cohomology of *any* Shimura variety. This is kind of interesting, because here is a programme for meromorphically continuing the L\\-function of an arbitrary smooth projective variety over a number field to the complex plane:\n\n1\\) Observe that automorphic forms for GL\\_n have very well\\-behaved L\\-functions; prove that they extend to the whole complex plane. \\[standard stuff].\n\n2\\) Prove the same for automorphic forms on any connected reductive algebraic group over a number field \\[i.e. prove Langlands functoriality]\n\n3\\) Prove that the L\\-functions attached to the cohomology of Shimura varieties can be interpreted in terms of automorphic forms \\[i.e. prove conjectures of Langlands, known in many cases]\n\n4\\) Prove that the cohomology of any algebraic variety at all (over a number field) shows up in the cohomology of a Shimura variety. \\[huge generalisation of Taniyama\\-Shimura\\-Weil modularity conjecture]\n\nMy understanding is that this programme, nice though it looks, is expected to fail because (4\\) is expected not to be true. And I believe I was once assured by an expert that the kind of variety for which problems might occur is the elliptic curve over $F$ mentioned above. At the time I did not understand the reasons given to me for why this should be the case, so of course now I can't reproduce them.\n\nHave I got this right or have I got my wires crossed?\n\nEDIT (more precisely, \"addition\"): Milne's comment below seems to indicate that I did misremember, and that in fact I was probably only told what Milne mentions below. So in fact I probably need to modify the question: the question I'd like to ask now is \"is (4\\) a reasonable statement?\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an example of an elliptic curve $E$ over $Q(\\\\sqrt{997})$ of conductor 1: $\\[ 0, w, 1, \\-24w \\- 289, \\-144w \\- 2334 ]$, where $w\\=(1\\+\\\\sqrt{997})/2$ (thanks to Lassina Dembelle; this curve even has rank 2!). Shimura's paper \"Construction of class fields and zeta functions of algebraic curves\" suggests (according to MathSciNet) how to construct a Shimura variety of dimension 2 that isn't a curve but is associated to the relevant quaternion algebra. Shimura lets the quaternion algebra act on the product of two copies of the upper half plane instead of 1, and is able to show the relevant variety is defined over Q by using Siegel modular forms. Perhaps the cohomology of $E$ shows up there? I don't know."

Option B is also incorrect, as a quaternion algebra ramified at one infinite place must also ramify at a finite place, which contradicts the conductor 1 condition of E.

Tachometer\n\nCould I simply use a logic level MOSFET to do the following?  \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3muo.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3muo.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can just plug it in, the connectors are designed to be compatible.\nthe fan will only run at full speed, that may or may not be a problem.\n\nif you want variable speed that's obviously not a suitable solution.\n\nusing the PWM signal (which is is probably only 0\\-3\\.3V) to switch a mosfet probably won't work well, and if it does work the fan will tend to stick on some harmonic of the PWM frequency instead of following the PWM ratio.\n\na better approach is is to use the PWM signal to control the set\\-point of a voltage regulator and use the regulator output to power the fan, thus controlling it speed.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0fNxd.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f0fNxd.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nhere I show the potentiometer on a typical adjustable ~~lm2958~~ LM2956 buck converter module and then the same module with the potentiometer replaced with a PWM control circuit. it works by the PWM controlling the discharge speed of C2 and thus the bias given to feedback signal.\n\nC1\\-R5 compensate for the low\\-pass formed by the presence of C2"

The **`nm`** utility is used to find symbols in an object file or executable. On most systems, **`ldd`** (`otool` on macOS) shows the shared libraries used by an executable. For the former, for example, I have a script ([*`listused.sh`*](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/listused.sh)) in ncurses which lists all of the symbols in its libraries and whether those are testable by a program using the libraries (see [report](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/ab10836a5884f5ca9a8c09110ce7486a9cbad9ec/test/README#L74) in [**`test/README`**](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/README)).\n\nThe `-C` option is useful (if you're interested in C\\+\\+ libraries), but the libraries may be *stripped* (lacking debugging information). However, the **`-D`** option (available on \"recent\" systems, e.g., almost anything updated in the past 10\\-15 years) provides symbols for *dynamic* libraries:\n\n* [GNU binutils](https://github.com/gittup/binutils/blob/252b5132c753830d5fd56823373aed85f2a0db63/binutils/nm.1), since 1999\n\n> Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols. This is\n> only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared\n> libraries.\n\n* [ELF Toolchain](https://sourceforge.net/p/elftoolchain/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/nm/), since 2008\n\n> Only display dynamic symbols.\n> This option is only meaningful for shared libraries.\n\n* [Solaris 11](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E88353_01/html/E37839/nm-1.html) (and [Solaris 10](https://docs.huihoo.com/solaris/10/english/html/816-5165/nm-1.html#scrolltoc)):\n\n> Displays the `SHT_DYNSYM` symbol information. This is the symbol table used by ld.so.1 and is present even in stripped dynamic executables. If **`\u2013D`** is not specified, the default behavior is to display the `SHT_SYMTAB` symbol information.\n\nThis is not a feature of less recent systems, at least according to their documentation:\n\n* [AIX](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/n_commands/nm.html)\n* [HP\\-UX](https://nixdoc.net/man-pages/HP-UX/man1/nm.1.html)\n\n(someone might know offhand the timeline for introducing the feature).\n\nI've used the feature in a few scripts such as [`analyze-curses-symbols`](https://invisible-island.net/scripts/readme.html#item:analyze-curses-symbols).\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* [Shared Library Symbol Conflicts (on Linux)](https://holtstrom.com/michael/blog/post/437/Shared-Library-Symbol-Conflicts-%28on-Linux%29.html)  provides examples showing how to use `nm` for this purpose.\n* [Chapter 3\\. Using Dynamic Shared Objects](http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/%7Etorgerse/Kokua/More_SGI/007-2360-010/sgi_html/ch03.html) from an old SGI manual mentions that `elfdump` has a relevant option:\n\n> If you use the \\-quickstart\\_info option, ld tells you if conflicts arise. It also tells you to run elfdump with the \\-Dc option to find the conflicts. See the elfdump(1\\) man page for more information about how to read the output produced by elfdump.\n\n* However, elfdump is not standardized (even to the extent that [**`nm`**](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/nm.html) is), and that **`-Dc`** is not found in other implementations such as [this one](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36870/elfdump-1.html), for Solaris.

I'd have to keep cross\\-referencing between two files, one containing the classes and the other containing the functions that create them. This wouldn't be a logical structure for my project, and I want to avoid it.\n\n**Edit**: to be clear, I'm not talking about cyclic dependencies \\- the classes `Foo` and `Bar` don't call `create_object`. I just mean that if the factory functions are in one file and the classes are in another, then in order to understand how my code works, future\\-me will have to first look up `create_object` in one file, and then find the constructors it calls in a different file. There are many classes and many factory functions, so this would have to be done a lot. I find this sort of jumping back and forth taxes my short\\-term memory unnecessarily, and generally makes things harder to understand. I'd prefer to have a single file, containing square and rectangle classes, followed by functions that create squares and rectangles, followed by circle and ellipse classes, followed by functions that create those, etc.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: \n\n(1\\) Is there a way to create the `objects` module without having a separate file for it? I know I can create a module by instantiating `types.ModuleType`, but I can't work out how to declare the classes to be in the new module.\n\n(2\\) Assuming I can solve (1\\), would that actually be a sensible thing to do?\n\n(3\\) Or am I thinking about this the wrong way somehow? What would be the standard way to solve this issue in Python?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think it's sensible to separate the classes from builder if this causes cross\\-references (and probably cyclic imports to solve). If your goal is simply to expose what is meant to be public or private there are better ways to explicit that.\n\nThe easiest I can think of is to have your module structured as follow :\n\n```\nmylib\n|-- __init__.py\n|-- objects.py\n\n```\n\nWhere `objects.py` is exactly what you already have and `__init__.py` simply does:\n\n```\nfrom .objects import create_object\n\n```\n\nSo if a user imports `mylib` the only available symbols in it will be the public API.\n\nIf there are many functions like `create_object` following naming convention, you can automate their import into `__init__.py` by including something like the following in `__init__.py`:\n\n```\nimport objects\nimport inspect\nimport sys\n\ncurrent_module = sys.modules[__name__]\ncreate_functions = [(name, func) for (name, func) in inspect.getmembers(objects, inspect.isfunction)\n                    if name.startswith('create_')]\n\nfor name, func in create_functions:\n    setattr(current_module, name, func)\n\n```"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a Python library with various objects represented as classes. You want to implement a design where users create objects through convenience functions rather than directly instantiating classes. Which approach best achieves this goal while maintaining code readability and avoiding unnecessary file separation?\n\nA) Create separate files for classes and factory functions, importing classes into the factory function file.\n\nB) Use a single file for both classes and factory functions, and expose only the factory functions in the module's __init__.py file.\n\nC) Create a new module programmatically using types.ModuleType and declare classes within it.\n\nD) Use metaclasses to control object instantiation and hide class constructors.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most suitable approach for this scenario. It allows you to keep related classes and factory functions in a single file (e.g., objects.py) for better readability and maintenance. By selectively exposing only the factory functions in the module's __init__.py file, you create a clean public API while keeping the class implementations \"hidden\" from direct instantiation by users. This method avoids unnecessary file separation, prevents potential circular import issues, and maintains a logical code structure. It also allows for easy expansion of the library with new classes and corresponding factory functions in the future."

The key reasons given are that better answers may be posted later, or flaws in initially accepted answers might be discovered over time. The answer states that preventing users from changing the accepted answer would discourage people from accepting answers at all, which is counterproductive. The correct option (B) accurately captures this rationale. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the goal is not to encourage frequent toggling of acceptances. Option C is incorrect because the proposed lock might actually decrease the number of accepted answers by making users more reluctant to accept.

Originally they were constructed by hand, but they also arise naturally in the real life, that is, theory of dynamical systems. (See, for example, this [http://www.math.cornell.edu/\\~hubbard/pendulum.pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/pendulum.pdf) paper of John Hubbard.)\n\nFrom dynamical construction it is clear that one can have a homeomorphism that permutes the lakes. For example, this expository paper [http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea\\-coudene.pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea-coudene.pdf) gives such a homeomorphism (in fact, a diffeomorphism) for lakes on the sphere $S^2$. The dynamics on the boundary of the lakes is chaotic. \n\n\\=\\=\n\nQuestion 1: Let $U\\_1$, $U\\_2$ and $U\\_3$ be open subset of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ with common boundary $C$. Assume that each $U\\_i$ is an image of an injective continuous map $\\\\mathbb R^d\\\\to\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that permutes open sets $U\\_i$ and is identity on $C$?\n\nQuestion 2: Let $U\\_i\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^d$, $i\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z$, be a disjoint collection of open sets each of which is homeomorphic to $\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that satisfies the following\n\n* $h$ maps $U\\_i$ onto $U\\_{i\\+1}$\n* every point in $\\\\partial U\\_i$ is periodic under $h$\n\n\\=\\=\n\n**Edit:** Below Andr\u00e9 Henriques has produced two examples when such a homeomorphism does not exist. Both examples make use of some local structure that cannot be permuted. It is still not clear what happens for \"abstact Wada Lakes\": are these examples exceptions or arbitrary Wada Lakes cannot be permuted as well? \n\n**Edit2** (Jan. 9th 2012\\) \n\n* In is clear now that there is no such homeomorphism if the dimension $d\\=2$. (See the comments below).\n* The answer to Q1 is also negative in higher dimension as explained in the reference given by Andres Koropecki.\n* For $d\\\\ge 3$ there are examples by Andr\u00e9 Henriques of open sets for which one cannot find such a homeomorphism. In general, Question 2 is still open.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In dimension 2, the answer is also \"no\".\n\nRecall the classical construction of the [Wada lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lakes_of_Wada.jpg).\nIn the linked picture, one sees little \"straits\" connecting the red/blue/green regions at stage $n$ with the extra windy strip that is added at stage $n\\+3$. For example, one sees a blue strait roughly in the middle of the picture, and a red strait (barely visible) on the upper left part. The location of these straights are free parameters in the construction of the Wada lakes.\n\n---\n\nNow I proceed to construct the desired counterexample.\nLet $P$ be a point on the boundary of the yet\\-to\\-be\\-constructed Wada lakes. And let $U$ be a fixed ball around $P$.\nThe straights can be picked so that:\n\n* The blue straights forms a converging sequence with limit point $P$.\n* The red and green straights all lie outside $U$.\n\nIn that case, there is no homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ fixing $P$, and exchanging the blue lake with a lake of another color. The reason is the following:\n\n* There exist arbitrarily small neighborhoods $V$ of $P$ such that all connected components of Red\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ and Green\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ intersect $\\\\partial V$ in exactly two intervals (taking $V$ be a metric ball will do).\n* For every sufficiently small neighborhood $V$ of $P$, there exist connected components of\nBlue\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ that intersect $\\\\partial V$ in at least three intervals (the components containing the straights)."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the possibility of a homeomorphism that permutes the lakes while fixing their common boundary?\n\nA) Such a homeomorphism always exists for any Wada lakes construction.\n\nB) Such a homeomorphism exists only if the \"straits\" of all three lakes converge to the same point on the boundary.\n\nC) Such a homeomorphism cannot exist in R^2, but may exist for similar constructions in higher dimensions.\n\nD) Such a homeomorphism is impossible in R^2 due to the potential for asymmetric local structure near boundary points.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As demonstrated in the counterexample, it's possible to construct Wada lakes where the blue lake has \"straits\" converging to a boundary point P, while the red and green lakes don't have such structures near P. This creates an asymmetric local structure that cannot be preserved under any homeomorphism that would permute the lakes. Specifically, small neighborhoods of P will have different topological properties for the blue lake compared to the red and green lakes, making it impossible for a homeomorphism to exchange them while fixing the boundary. This asymmetry in local structure near boundary points rules out the existence of such a homeomorphism in R^2 for arbitrary Wada lakes constructions."

(M,E) satisfies reflection for ZFC\\*\\* , so there is some x in M which M thinks is a ctm (countable transitive model) of ZFC\\*\\* . So M can find a Cohen extension y of x which satisfies ZFC\\* plus non\\-CH.\n6. By the easy direction of the completeness theorem, M therefore thinks that ZFC\\*\\+non\\-CH is consistent.\n7. But then this theory is really consistent. (Because any proof of an inconsistency would be coded by a natural number, which is represented in M.)\n\nBtw, I think the sketch I just gave is not ideal since it seems to rely on the existence of infinite sets. The implication from Con(ZFC) to Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) can really be shown in ZF minus infinity, or even in a weak version of Peano arithmetic."

The documentation shows that it is possible to prove Con(ZFC) \u2192 Con(ZFC + \u00acCH) entirely within ZFC using the reflection principle and forcing techniques. The proof outlined in the documentation uses the reflection principle (which is a theorem scheme provable in ZFC) along with forcing concepts to demonstrate this implication. It does not require methods outside of ZFC, nor does it necessarily require the existence of a countable transitive model of ZFC. While the last point mentions that the implication can be shown in even weaker systems, the question asks specifically about provability within ZFC, making B the most accurate answer."

C., \\& Steyvers, M. (2013\\). Choosing a strictly proper scoring rule. Decision Analysis, 10(4\\), 292\\-304](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/MerkleSteyvers.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is appropriate to use an improper scoring rule when the purpose is actually forecasting, but not inference. I don't really care whether another forecaster is cheating or not when I am the one who is going to be doing the forecast.\n\nProper scoring rules ensure that during estimation process the model approaches the true data generating process (DGP). This sounds promising because as we approach the true DGP we will be also doing good in terms of forecasting under any loss function. The catch is that most of the time (actually in reality almost always) our model search space doesn't contain the true DGP. We end up approximating the true DGP with some functional form that we propose.\n\nIn this more realistic setting, if our forecasting task is easier than to figure out the entire density of the true DGP we may actually do better. This is especially true for classification. For example the true DGP can be very complex but the classification task can be very easy. \n\nYaroslav Bulatov provided the following example in his blog:\n\n[http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log\\-loss\\-or\\-hinge\\-loss.html](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log-loss-or-hinge-loss.html)\n\nAs you can see below the true density is wiggly but it is very easy to build a classifier to separate data generated by this into two classes. Simply if $x \\\\ge 0$ output class 1, and if $x \\< 0$ output class 2\\.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)\n\nInstead of matching the exact density above we propose the below crude model, which is quite far from the true DGP. However it does perfect classification. This is found by using hinge loss, which is not proper.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)\n\nOn the other hand if you decide to find the true DGP with log\\-loss (which is proper) then you start fitting some functionals, as you don't know what the exact functional form you need a priori. But as you try harder and harder to match it, you start misclassifying things.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)\n\nNote that in both cases we used the same functional forms. In the improper loss case it degenerated into a step function which in turn did perfect classification. In the proper case it went berserk trying to satisfy every region of the density. \n\nBasically we don't always need to achieve the true model to have accurate forecasts. Or sometimes we don't really need to do good on the entire domain of the density, but be very good only on certain parts of it."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is developing a classification model for a complex dataset. The true data generating process (DGP) is highly intricate, but the classification task itself is relatively straightforward. Which of the following approaches would likely yield the best classification performance?\n\nA) Use a proper scoring rule like log-loss to closely approximate the true DGP\nB) Employ an improper scoring rule such as hinge loss to focus on the classification boundary\nC) Always use a proper scoring rule to ensure unbiased probability estimates\nD) Avoid both proper and improper scoring rules in favor of a non-probabilistic approach\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nIn this scenario, an improper scoring rule like hinge loss (option B) would likely yield the best classification performance. As explained in the documentation, when the true DGP is complex but the classification task is simple, attempting to closely approximate the entire density (as a proper scoring rule would do) can actually lead to poorer classification results. An improper scoring rule can focus on the decision boundary, potentially achieving better classification accuracy even if it doesn't capture the full complexity of the underlying distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a proper scoring rule like log-loss might lead to overfitting the complex DGP, potentially at the expense of classification accuracy.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while proper scoring rules have advantages for probability estimation, they aren't always optimal for classification tasks, especially when the true DGP is very complex.\n\nOption D is incorrect because scoring rules (both proper and improper) can be valuable tools in machine learning, and avoiding them entirely would be unnecessarily limiting."

Because English is not my first language (Spanish is), I'd like some help making sure I index these correctly. \n\nFor example, in my index, should I use:\n\n* ***Description of the project*** or ***Project Description***\n* ***Benefits of this proposal*** or ***Proposal benefits***\n* ***Preliminary schedule of the project*** or just ***Preliminary schedule***\n\nAre there any rules or guidelines that would help me know the best way to set up my index for entries that could be listed in more than one way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, for section headers, I would favor the briefer forms, such as: *Project Description, Project Justification, Project Scope, Benefits, Project Deliverables, Preliminary Schedule*, etc. \n\nIn an actual sentence, though, either form could be used; for example, either \"Here is the preliminary schedule for this project\" or \"Here is the project's preliminary schedule\" would be acceptable.\n\nIn an index, you need to take a best guess as to which word the readers will look for when they want to find the information. I would avoid starting any index entry with \"Project\", as your index would be flooded with entries under the letter P. Instead, I would use a form like this:\n\n> **D**  \n> \n>  Deliverables for the project  \n> \n>  :  \n> \n> **S**  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, detailed  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, preliminary\n\nIt's not uncommon for an index to list multiple forms for an entry, but usually the page number is only given in one place (this makes the index easier to maintain should new information be added). So, you might consider using something like this, if you feel it would enhance the usability of the index:\n\n> **P**  \n> \n>  Project Deliverables: see *Deliverables for the project*"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In preparing an index for a formal work proposal, which of the following approaches is most appropriate and efficient?\n\nA) List all entries starting with \"Project\" to ensure consistency throughout the index\nB) Use longer, more descriptive phrases for each entry (e.g., \"Description of the project\" instead of \"Project Description\")\nC) Avoid starting entries with common words like \"Project\" and use concise, specific terms as main entry points\nD) Randomly alternate between longer phrases and shorter terms to provide variety in the index\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to avoid starting entries with common words like \"Project\" and use concise, specific terms as main entry points. This is supported by the advice given in the documentation, which suggests:\n\n1. Favoring briefer forms for section headers (e.g., \"Project Description\" rather than \"Description of the project\").\n2. Avoiding starting index entries with \"Project\" to prevent flooding the index with entries under the letter P.\n3. Using specific terms as main entry points (e.g., \"Deliverables for the project\" under D, rather than \"Project Deliverables\" under P).\n4. Using cross-references when necessary to guide readers to the correct entry (e.g., \"Project Deliverables: see Deliverables for the project\").\n\nThis approach makes the index more user-friendly and easier to navigate, as readers can quickly find the information they need under the most relevant and specific terms."

This will draw 9 A from the 220 V, so 1980 W.\n\nThis will be great force electromagnetic but the problem is this: the 21 gauge can only withstand 1\\.2 A maximum; to avoid getting maximum current I need to make the resistance 183 \u03a9, which means about 3 km of wire!\n\nAnd this will cause less force because the current now is 1\\.2 A; calculating other gauges in the same manner will result in this too\\-long length.\n\nIs my calculation wrong, or is the reality not like the theory, or what?\n\nHow to make a solenoid coil that can connect to 220 V safely, and the gauge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It\u2019s probably not a capacitor, but a transient voltage suppressor (TVS). It\u2019s likely the MOV (metallic oxide varistor) type. Its purpose is to catch and dissipate high\\-voltage spikes that can damage the power supply primary side.\n\nYour power supply can work without it, but it will be more susceptible to transient spikes on the line, so better to keep it, or if it\u2019s damaged, replace it.\n\nCommon vendors for these include Panasonic, TDK, Littelfuse.\n\nIf the MOV is fried, probably other things downstream are damaged too, like the input filter caps. Check those for signs of stress, like leaks or bulging out. Replace any bad ones with the *exact* same type: they need to be safety certified and have adequate temperature range and electrical performance."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The damaged component is likely a capacitor and should be replaced with any available capacitor of similar size.\n\nB) The component is probably a transient voltage suppressor (TVS) of the MOV type, and the power supply will function normally without it.\n\nC) If the MOV is damaged, it's the only component that needs replacement, and the power supply will be fully restored after replacing just this part.\n\nD) The damaged component is likely a TVS/MOV, and while the power supply may work without it, replacing it is recommended. Additionally, other components like input filter capacitors should be inspected for damage.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The damaged component is most likely a transient voltage suppressor (TVS), specifically a metallic oxide varistor (MOV). While the power supply might function without it, it's crucial for protecting against high-voltage spikes. Replacing it is recommended for proper protection. Furthermore, if the MOV is damaged, it's possible that other components downstream, such as input filter capacitors, may also be affected. These should be inspected and replaced if necessary, ensuring they match the exact specifications for safety and performance reasons. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they either misidentify the component, underestimate the importance of the TVS/MOV, or oversimplify the potential extent of the damage."

This does not prevent you from continuing to ssh in to an existing instance with the ssh private key that you stored locally as your instance will continue to have a copy of the public key in .ssh/authorized\\_keys. It simply prevents you from creating new instances with the same keypair.\n\nIn a related question (in case people end up here looking for this answer)...\n\nIf you delete your local copy of the ssh private key, then you will not be able to ssh into the instance if that is the only public key stored in the .ssh/authorized\\_keys file.

Out of these, one band (suffixed as \\_maxcorr) is actually not computed by the servers but still exists in the output as a GLCM band with all zero pixel values. \n\nThis \\_maxcorr band creates a problem when band\\-wise normalization of the image composite is attempted by the unitScale() function as this function requires min value to be less than the max value.\n\nHow to tackle this issue? \n\nI thought of two possibilities:\n\nPrevent glcmTexture() from generating the \"\\_maxcorr\" band\nOR\nRemove \"\\_maxcorr\" band before input to unitScale() function\n\nHow to remove a specific band from an image in GEE?\nTrying reverse by using .select() function is not feasible as there are hundreds of other bands in the composite that need to be selected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to remove particular bands from an image, you can take the image's `bandNames`, `filter` that list to only the bands you want, and `select` those bands from the image:\n\n```js\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(\n    glcmImage.bandNames().filter(\n      ee.Filter.stringEndsWith('item', '_maxcorr').not()));\n}\n\nMap.addLayer(removeMaxCorr(myImage.glcmTexture()));\n\n```\n\n(The pseudo\\-property name 'item' is [the name used to refer to the value of a `List` item that isn't a feature with its own properties](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-list-filter) \u2014 here, a string.)."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Google Earth Engine, you want to remove a specific band named \"_maxcorr\" from a GLCM texture image before applying the unitScale() function. Which of the following code snippets correctly achieves this?\n\nA) \n```javascript\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(glcmImage.bandNames().remove('_maxcorr'));\n}\n```\n\nB) \n```javascript\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(\n    glcmImage.bandNames().filter(\n      ee.Filter.stringEndsWith('item', '_maxcorr').not()));\n}\n```\n\nC) \n```javascript\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.removeBand('_maxcorr');\n}\n```\n\nD) \n```javascript\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(\n    glcmImage.bandNames().filter(\n      ee.Filter.stringContains('item', '_maxcorr').not()));\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct answer because it uses the proper method to filter out the \"_maxcorr\" band from the image. It utilizes the `bandNames()` function to get all band names, then applies a filter using `ee.Filter.stringEndsWith()` to exclude any band ending with \"_maxcorr\". The `not()` function inverts the filter to keep all bands except those ending with \"_maxcorr\". Finally, it selects these filtered bands from the original image.\n\nOption A is incorrect because `remove()` is not a valid method for an ee.List object returned by `bandNames()`.\n\nOption C is incorrect because `removeBand()` is not a standard method in Google Earth Engine for removing bands from an image.\n\nOption D is close but incorrect because it uses `stringContains()` instead of `stringEndsWith()`. This could potentially remove bands that have \"_maxcorr\" anywhere in their name, not just at the end."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is debugging a circuit where LEDs continue to emit a faint glow even when the MOSFET is turned off (Logic 0 at gate). Which of the following best explains this phenomenon and suggests a potential solution?\n\nA) The MOSFET has a high leakage current when off. Replacing it with a BJT would solve the issue.\n\nB) The circuit has parasitic capacitance, causing a slow discharge path. Adding a pull-down resistor in parallel with the LEDs could mitigate this.\n\nC) The power supply has ripple voltage, keeping the LEDs partially lit. Installing a voltage regulator would fix the problem.\n\nD) The LEDs have a very low forward voltage, allowing them to conduct with minimal current. Using higher forward voltage LEDs would eliminate the glow.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The faint glow of the LEDs when the MOSFET is off is likely due to parasitic capacitance in the circuit. In real-world applications, components like MOSFETs have small amounts of capacitance that can store charge. When the MOSFET is turned off, this stored charge discharges slowly through the LEDs, causing them to emit a faint light. \n\nAdding a pull-down resistor in parallel with the LEDs provides an alternative discharge path for this parasitic capacitance, which can help to more quickly drain the stored charge and reduce or eliminate the faint glow. This solution addresses the non-ideal behavior of real-world components, as mentioned in the documentation about capacitors and inductors not behaving ideally in practice.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\nA) While MOSFETs do have some leakage current, it's typically not enough to cause visible LED glow.\nC) Power supply ripple would affect the circuit regardless of the MOSFET state.\nD) Even low forward voltage LEDs shouldn't conduct significantly when the MOSFET is fully off."

This is not an especially random\\-looking group of sources.\n\nThereafter, Google Books finds matches from [1915](http://books.google.com/books?id=FUkgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA183&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), [1916](http://books.google.com/books?id=u-8WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA366&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and [1930](http://books.google.com/books?id=CgQU09UDVaIC&pg=PA10&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and then seven unique instances during the period from 1945 through1947\\.\n\nWhether Julia Stretton is directly responsible for popularizing the notion of being \"a fly on the wall\" in order to gather information or witness a private scene is difficult to determine; but it seems fair to say that the six English and American women cited above whose relevant novels appeared between 1855 and 1907 almost certainly deserve credit for popularizing (in English) that wording for a very old idea."

While Shakespeare did use fly metaphors, he didn't use this exact phrase. The passage also shows that the phrase gained popularity through works by several female novelists between 1855 and 1907, before becoming more widely used in the mid-20th century. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement based on the given information."

How does it emerge from the Standard Model?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not accidental, at least in the sense that this term is used.\n\nThe accidental symmetry is the symmetry that is forced on you by the renormalizability \\- i.e. for a given field set you can't write the interaction that would violate such symmetry. On the other hand nonrenormalizable interactions or renormalizable interactions with extra fields (these two options are related) may violate symmetry. The example is the baryonic number conservation which is easily violated in many extensions of the standard model.\n\nOn the other hand the lepton universality is the property of the non\\-abelian gauge invariance. In qft the non\\-abelian gauge interaction is determined solely by the representation of the field and the coupling constant, common for all the fields. I.e. you can't have $SU(2\\)$ doublet interacting with $W$ boson 1% stronger than another doublet.\n\nOf course this constraint is weaker for $U(1\\)$ interaction, such as hypercharge field. But if you change somewhat $Y$ for some lepton, this may ruin the gauge invariance of the mass terms and the triangle anomaly cancellation."

It arises from the fact that non-abelian gauge interactions are determined solely by the representation of the field and the coupling constant, which is common for all fields. This means that all leptons of the same type (e.g., all left-handed leptons) must interact with gauge bosons (like the W boson) with the same strength. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Lepton Flavour Universality is not an accidental symmetry forced by renormalizability. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while some symmetries (like baryon number conservation) can be violated by non-renormalizable interactions, Lepton Flavour Universality is more fundamental and tied to the gauge structure of the theory.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while U(1) interactions (like hypercharge) allow more flexibility, arbitrarily changing the hypercharge of leptons would disrupt gauge invariance of mass terms and triangle anomaly cancellation."

I've contributed some fixes to the origin (such as working around canvas rendering limitations on low\\-memory devices), but I've also added in a bunch of functionality that I wanted in the software, such as:\n\n1. `viewMode: 4`: When the image is rotated, it scales so that the entire image is always visible inside the container. The cropBox is also always constrained within the *image*, rather than just the *canvas*.\n2. `getCroppedCanvas` tiling: The ability to tile (eg: duplicate matrix\\-style) the cropped image on a canvas.\n\nHowever, the original author does not want to merge in this new functionality because he wants to keep his original plugin as simple as possible.\n\nI've tried negotiating and bargaining, but am just getting ignored.\n\nSo, I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to continue to maintain this public fork. Not ideal, but I really want that other functionality.

I know that I'm effectively working on a new version that is my own, but it's based on a foundation that was authored by someone else.\n2. Is it ok to masquerade as if this new fork is totally mine? eg: Replace links to the github.io page for the original project to my own in my forked README? It sort of feels wrong to not link back to the original, but the github.io has demos on it, and I'd like to demo the new functionality I'm putting in.\n3. Is there any part of a repo, be it the README.md, the site etc that I should totally replace with my own work to make it more...appropriately mine?\n4. Should I change the licence wording to remove the original Author's name, and replace it with mine?\n\nBasically, it doesn't feel like the fork is mine, even though all the new work is my own.\nI don't want to pi$$ anyone off, and the original work was really good.\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance that people can offer so that I do the right thing, which is all I want to do, really.\n\n**Update**  \n\nHere's what I did in the end <https://github.com/OddPrints/cropper> :\n\n1. Added the Credit and Why the Fork? sections plus the mention under the main blockquote.\n2.

He was discussing the very peculiar phenomena of dropping an oversized slinky and watching as the bottom of the slinky remains suspended in mid air. Tyson goes onto explain that the bottom of the slinky simply does not know to fall until the arrival of the top which carries information of the gravitational force \\- it is essentially oblivious to the gravity exerted on it (I may be butchering his more eloquent explanation a bit).\n\nI have more recently heard a somewhat simpler (and for easier to accept) explanation regarding the fact that the spring is constantly applying an elastic force on the bottom of the spring to keep it suspended. I suppose this would even delay the decent of rigid objects to a very subtle degree since there is always some elasticity?\n\nSeeing as the former explanation is some what more grand and makes for a better story, I would like to confirm which of these holds more weight.\n\nI have already done a bit of searching on this site and understand that gravity is limited by the speed of light, but I do not believe that this is necessarily applicable here, so as far as I know this question has not been tackled here as of yet.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably confused what he was saying a bit. The information that the bottom of the slinky is waiting for is the information that the top of the slinky is no longer supported. This travels down the slinky as the higher bits fall down and no longer exert a force (tension) supporting the lower bits.\n\nIncidentally in other circumstances the speed of gravity (which travels at the same speed as light) is significant. The standard example is if someone stole the sun it would take 8 minutes for that information to get to us. The light from the sun and the sudden lack of it's gravity would both take about 8 minutes to get here. In the intervening 8 minutes we would continue to orbit the place the sun used to be as normal."

What best explains why the bottom of the slinky appears to hover momentarily before falling?\n\nA) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information about gravity to reach it at the speed of light.\nB) The elastic force of the spring exactly counteracts gravity on the bottom portion until the top portion falls.\nC) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information that the top is no longer supported, which travels down the slinky as a wave of tension release.\nD) The slinky creates a localized anti-gravity field that temporarily suspends the bottom portion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The bottom of the slinky appears to hover because it's waiting for information that the top is no longer supported. This information travels down the slinky as a wave of tension release, not at the speed of light. As the higher portions of the slinky fall, they stop exerting an upward force on the lower portions, and this effect propagates down the slinky.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while gravity does propagate at the speed of light, this is not the relevant factor in the slinky's behavior. \n\nAnswer B is partially correct in recognizing the role of the spring's elastic force, but it doesn't fully explain the wave-like nature of the slinky's collapse.\n\nAnswer D is simply incorrect and not based on any scientific principle.\n\nThis question tests understanding of wave propagation in materials, forces in springs, and common misconceptions about gravity and information transfer in physical systems."

For example:\n\n1. The graph shows SO reputation of 259 on April 20, while the /reputation data indicates it was actually 761 on that date.\n2. The graph displays negative reputation for the period of April 10-16, which is not reflected in the /reputation details.\n3.

While all options relate to the concept of disproportion or inequality, \"merely\" is the most appropriate choice for several reasons:\n\n1. It avoids prefixes, adhering to the question's preference.\n2. It maintains eloquence and simplicity in expression.\n3. It effectively conveys the sense of a lesser action without requiring additional context.\n4. As noted in the documentation, \"merely\" combined with silence (i.e., not adding any other words) sufficiently expresses the contrast between the two actions.\n\n\"Disproportionately\" (A) and \"Unequally\" (C) are related concepts but don't precisely fit the context or maintain the elegance required. \"Incommensurately\" (D) directly contradicts the requirement for a non-prefixed word.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of nuanced language use, context-appropriate word choice, and the ability to discern subtle differences in meaning and connotation."

Whitney's condition (b) is usually defined using local coordinates and specifically the notion of convergence in the usual Euclidean topology.\n\nIt turns out that if $M$ is a nonsingular complex algebraic variety and $S$ is a subvariety, then there is a canonical Whitney stratification of $S$ whose strata are nonsingular algebraic sets.\n\nMy question is: in the complex algebraic category, can one define the notion of Whitney stratifications using only commutative algebra?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a purely algebraic characterisation of Condition (B) due to Le and Teissier, see Proposition 1\\.3\\.8 of the paper\n\n*L\u00ea D\u0169ng Tr\u00e1ng; Teissier, Bernard*, [**Limites d\u2019espaces tangents en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie analytique.

Assume that $X$ is a complex algebraic variety (embedded in $\\\\mathbb{C}^n$ if affine or $\\\\mathbb{P}^n$ if projective) and that $Y \\\\subset X$ is a smooth quasiprojective subvariety. Then the pair $(X\\_\\\\text{reg},Y)$ satisfies Condition (B) if and only if there is a containment of ideals $$I\\[\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\cap \\\\textbf{Con}(Y)] \\\\subset \\\\overline{I}\\[\\\\kappa\\_X^{\\-1}(Y)]$$\n\nSome explanation: here $I\\[Z]$ means the generating ideal of $Z$, while $\\\\textbf{Con}(X)$ is the conormal variety of $X$ and $\\\\kappa\\_X:\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\to X$ is the conormal map.

You can attach a single rune to each of these skills at a time. You can change skills and runes at any time, including in combat, but doing so triggers a cooldown on that slot. You may choose any skill for any slot, if you have Elective Mode enabled in the games options.\n\nGetting used to changing skills often is ill advised as at end\\-game doing so is penalised heavily in the form of resetting a buff you gain called Nephalem's Valor which improves the number and quality of drops you obtain through your game session.

Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding skill and rune usage in the game?\n\nA) Players can use all unlocked skills and runes simultaneously, but are limited to 6 active skills at a time.\n\nB) Once a rune is selected for a skill, it cannot be changed without resetting the character's progress.\n\nC) Players can freely switch between skills and runes at any time without any penalties or cooldowns.\n\nD) Players can use up to 6 skills at a time, with one rune per skill, and can change them at any time, but doing so triggers a cooldown on that slot.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, players can use up to 6 skills at a time, one for each mouse button and four bound to other keys. Each skill can have one rune attached to it. Players can change skills and runes at any time, including during combat, but doing so triggers a cooldown on that skill slot. This allows for flexibility in gameplay while maintaining some balance through the cooldown mechanic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while players can use up to 6 skills, they cannot use all unlocked skills simultaneously.\n\nOption B is false because runes can be changed without resetting character progress, although there may be penalties for frequent changes at end-game due to the Nephalem's Valor buff.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while players can change skills and runes freely, doing so does trigger a cooldown, contrary to the statement that there are no penalties or cooldowns."

The generated/code directory cannot be fully cleared, and files keep regenerating. What is the most likely cause of this problem and its solution?\n\nA) The site is still in production mode, causing files to regenerate. Solution: Verify and set the correct mode using deploy:mode:show and env.php.\n\nB) The generated/code/Magento/Framework directory is locked. Solution: Manually delete this directory using sudo rm -rf.\n\nC) Cache is not properly cleared. Solution: Flush the cache and run static-content deploy.\n\nD) A custom theme is interfering with the module disabling process. Solution: Remove the custom theme temporarily.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the question mentions checking the mode and clearing generated files, the persistent regeneration of files suggests a caching issue. In Magento 2, flushing the cache and running static-content deploy is often necessary after making significant changes or switching modes. This process ensures that all cached data and pre-generated content are properly cleared and rebuilt, which can resolve issues with stubborn files in the generated directory. The other options, while potentially relevant in some scenarios, do not directly address the core issue of file regeneration described in the question."

That statement alone is not enough information for a moderator to act on, to begin with it does not prove that the question is off\\-topic. It is merely arguably a strong indicator that it is so.\n\nIf you flag for moderator intervention, you should make sure you are basically laying out the situation on a silver platter such that the required action can be understood without first having to study the source question.

The specs you should be most concerned with are the output voltage (12V) and current (no less than 850mA \\- more is ok)."

In this case, the output voltage would be proportionally reduced when the input voltage is lowered. Since the original input is 220V and the new input would be 120V, the output voltage can be calculated as: 12V * (120/220) \u2248 6.5V. \n\nThis reduced voltage output would not damage the adapter itself, but it would result in poor performance of the connected motor. The motor might struggle to start or stall more easily, potentially leading to motor damage over time. \n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they don't account for the change in input voltage.

It can either be set to SPI Motorola mode (0\\) or to SPI TI mode (1\\). (See the ARM reference manual page 695 [here](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/REFERENCE_MANUAL/CD00225773.pdf).)\n\nThe datasheet of the SPI Flash (available [here](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEIQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.gaw.ru%2Fproject%2Fdownload.php%3Fid%3D17019&ei=qEVjT4e1BYa48gP3z7iSCA&usg=AFQjCNGxHADH0jlYEafp0A31GarfzkfrFQ)) does not give indication regarding which mode I should use.\n\nWhat are the two different modes, and which should I use for the specific Flash chip I am using?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A brief glance at the ARM data sheet would suggest that the main difference between the TI mode and Motorola mode have to do with their handling of an output signal called SSPFSSOUT which many devices simply don't need. This signal is supposed to pulse high between bytes so as to indicate which bit of each byte should be considered the first. In TI mode, it goes high during the transmission of the last bit of a byte, while in Motorola mode it goes high and then low between bytes. The flash chip wants a chip\\-select signal which is held low for the entire duration of a transaction, so an output which goes high between bytes won't be useful for it.\n\nI would expect that even when SSPFSSOUT isn't used, Motorola mode would make data easier to read on a scope (since there would be a pause after every byte) but TI mode might be faster (since it wouldn't waste any time pausing between bytes). What's important, however, is to ensure that the sequence of signals the controller generates meets the requirements given in the peripherals' data sheet."

However, most SPI Flash devices don't utilize this signal. Instead, they rely on a chip select signal that remains low for the entire transaction. The Motorola mode may offer easier scope reading due to pauses between bytes, while TI mode might be slightly faster without these pauses. The critical factor is ensuring that the controller's signal sequence meets the SPI Flash device's requirements, regardless of the chosen mode. Therefore, the choice between modes is less important for basic SPI Flash operation, making option C the most accurate statement."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Ubuntu 22.04, a user experiences issues with Firefox (installed via Snap) not being able to open the Dropbox website when launched from the Dropbox application. Which of the following statements best describes the root cause and potential solution to this problem?\n\nA) The issue is primarily caused by incompatibility between Dropbox and Ubuntu 22.04, and can be resolved by upgrading Dropbox to the latest version.\n\nB) The problem stems from Firefox's inability to handle external links in Ubuntu 22.04, and can be fixed by modifying Firefox's configuration settings.\n\nC) The issue is a result of Snap's containerization affecting Firefox's ability to access temporary files, and may require changes in how Snap packages interact with the system or how Dropbox generates temporary files.\n\nD) Ubuntu 22.04's core system files are incompatible with Firefox and Dropbox, necessitating a rollback to Ubuntu 20.04 for proper functionality.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The problem is primarily related to Snap, which is a relatively new technology for packaging and distributing applications in Ubuntu. Snap's containerization can affect how applications interact with the system, including accessing temporary files. In this case, Firefox (installed via Snap) is unable to access the temporary HTML file created by Dropbox, resulting in the \"File not found\" error.\n\nThe correct answer highlights that the issue is rooted in how Snap packages interact with the system, particularly in relation to temporary file access. This explains why installing Firefox without Snap resolves the issue, as noted in the workaround. The solution may require changes either in how Snap manages file access for containerized applications or in how Dropbox generates and handles temporary files for external links.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect as they misattribute the cause to other components or suggest overly drastic solutions that don't address the core issue with Snap's containerization."

Due to storage limitations, I want the repository to be empty initially and download packages once they are accessed.\n\n### Background\n\nI work a lot with local VMs. Anytime I create a new VM and install Fedora, a lot of packages are downloaded from the internet, and most of the downloaded packages are the same. To speed up the process I would like the RPMs to be cached on a server located on the same network.\n\nSimilar questions have been answered with a combination of `createrepo` \\& `reposync`. I do not like the `reposync` part, because I don't want to clone the whole repository up\u202ffront when I need only some of the packages.\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nI would like the server on my local network to act as an RPM repository for my Fedora installations. It should pass\\-through the metadata from whatever is configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`. The server should deliver the requested RPM if it is present in the local cache, or else download it and then deliver it.\n\nA less ambitious approach would be to configure a single RPM repository instead of `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/...` and just use an http proxy.\n\n### Update: 02 Nov. 2015\n\nI already have an nginx running on the network, so I played around with a combination of `proxy_pass` and `proxy_cache`. It kinda works, but IMHO it has more drawbacks than benefits:\n\n* a separate configuration for every repo configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`.\n* can't use `metadata` from `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/` because of alternate mirrors.\n\nI dropped the nginx thing and installed `squid`, as suggested in comments. `squid` works great for me. With the `store_id_program` configuration, I am even able to use the alternate mirrors and still hit the cache, no matter where the RPM came from originally.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here you can find fine\\-tuned squid.conf for rpm caching:\n\n<https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/blob/master/proxy/installer/squid.conf>\n\nYou just should modify memory and port setting."

From Googling I still can't tell which programming language I should use for this and whether I would need any external addons or just the functions built in to LibreOffice.\n\n(I'm happy to migrate this question to StackOverflow if it's decided that it really belongs there.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After 4 years, they still haven't implemented the suggested `FILTERJSON()`.\n\nThis is obviously not a real solution, but one that works for now, for very simple cases:\n\n1. Send a request to your API using: `=WEBSERVICE(\"http://example.com/v1/stuff\")` in eg. cell A1\n2. In cell A2 for example, add `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"rootProperty\";A1)+2;10)` (remember to change the separator characters (semicolons in my case) to match your locale in LibreOffice)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `MID()` will take a partial text from the full response\n* `SEARCH()` will look for the beginning index of the given text, eg. \"rootProperty\"\n* `+2` is the offset where to start reading the value (basically substring)\n* `10` is how many characters to read from the beginning of the text `SEARCH()` found (after the `+2` offset)\n\nSo if for example you get the following response in cell A1:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 12345678,\n  \"something\": \"Example\",\n  \"myThing\": \"Hello\",\n  \"another\": \"Not needed\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd your cell A2 has the formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1);13)`\n\nWhat the cell would have as value is: `myThing\": \"He`\nWhich is `13` characters starting from the first character in `myThing`, that you searched for in `SEARCH()`.\n\nSo obviously you wouldn't want to have the `myThing\": \"` part of it. To only get the value `Hello` from `myThing`, you would use this formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1)+11;5)`.\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Find where `myThing` begins (caveat: if there's two instances of the string, you'll get the first one)\n2. Return 5 characters from the offset. So: `myThi`\n3. Then offsets the beginning to be from index `11` (the `+11` in the formula)\n4. So it skips the first 11 characters (`myThing\": \"`) and returns 5 characters from there on, which is `Hello`\n\nOf course, it's still fairly manual, but at least one workable way for simple things. Good luck!"

The JSON response is in cell A1 and looks like this:\n{\n  \"id\": 12345678,\n  \"something\": \"Example\",\n  \"myThing\": \"Hello\",\n  \"another\": \"Not needed\"\n}\nWhich formula would you use in cell A2 to extract only the value \"Hello\" associated with the \"myThing\" key?\n\nA) =MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1);13)\nB) =MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1)+11;5)\nC) =WEBSERVICE(\"http://example.com/v1/stuff\")\nD) =FILTERJSON(A1;\"myThing\")\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct answer because it uses the MID function with the appropriate parameters to extract only the \"Hello\" value:\n- SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1) finds the starting position of \"myThing\"\n- +11 offsets the start to skip \"myThing\": \"\n- 5 is the length of \"Hello\"\n\nOption A would return \"myThing\": \"He\", including the key and part of the value.\nOption C is the WEBSERVICE function used to fetch the JSON, not to extract a value from it.\nOption D uses a fictional FILTERJSON function that doesn't exist in LibreOffice Calc."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As a non\\-English speaker whose native language does not have articles I am always unsure about the use of them. \nThis time I would like to clarify the use of the article \"THE\" together with positions of persons. For example:\n\n> John Smith and **the** director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nIf I state the name of the person do I need \"THE\"? I understand that if I said just \"John and the director of my department went...\" \"THE\" would be necessary but does that change when stating the name also? \n\nSimilarly, do I need to put \"THE\" in this type of sentence:\n\n> **The** Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron announced changes in immigration policy.\n\nIf I don't need the definite article here then why so? Are the two examples equal? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use them with or without an article, but the meaning is ever so slightly different. When you use them without the definite article, *THE*, then you are using an official title. Grammatically it is like a name, it's a Proper Noun. In this case you need to use capital letters for the title: *Managing Director*, for example.\n\nWhen you use the titles or positions without an article, that's just a description of the person's job. Its a bit like saying *I'm a teacher*. So we can say:\n\n* Managing Director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nor:\n\n* The managing director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nThe first is a title, the second a description. When we are using the second form we have the option to use capitals if we want to: *The Managing Director ...*\n\nIn the Original Poster's example:\n\n* John Smith and the director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nWe need to use the definite article here. The reason is that *the director of my department* is a description, not an official title. However if you wanted to use a title you could:\n\n* John Smith and Director of Marketing, Adam Gray, both attended the\nmeeting.\n\nThis is similar to how we use proper noun titles like *King* or common noun descriptions like *king*.\n\n* The king of my country is an idiot.\n* King of Spain, Felipe VI was asked yesterday ...\n\n*Hope his is helpful!*"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"the\" with titles or positions is correct?\n\nA) \"The\" must always be used before a person's title or position when it's followed by their name.\nB) Using \"the\" before a title makes it an official title, while omitting it makes it a job description.\nC) Capitalization of titles is only correct when \"the\" is used before the title.\nD) When omitting \"the\", the title becomes a Proper Noun and should be capitalized.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. According to the documentation, when you omit the definite article \"the\" before a title, it becomes an official title and is treated as a Proper Noun. In this case, it should be capitalized. \n\nOption A is incorrect because \"the\" is not always required before a title when followed by a name. It depends on whether you're using it as an official title or a description.\n\nOption B is actually the opposite of what the documentation states. Omitting \"the\" makes it an official title, while using \"the\" turns it into a description of the person's job.\n\nOption C is incorrect because capitalization can be used in both cases, with or without \"the\", although it's required when omitting \"the\" and using it as an official title.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the subtle differences in meaning and grammatical treatment when using or omitting \"the\" before titles or positions."
