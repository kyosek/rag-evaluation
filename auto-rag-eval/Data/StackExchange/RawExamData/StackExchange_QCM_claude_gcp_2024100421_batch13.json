Does that mean $\\\\aleph\\_x$ in ZF may NOT be equal to $\\\\aleph\\_x$ in ZFC?\n\n2\\.I don't know how to define $\\\\aleph$ in ZF.\nHere's what I tried. Do we call $A$, the class of alephs?\n\nThat is, let $\\[\\\\alpha]$ \\= {$\\\\beta \\\\in OR$\\|$\\\\beta \\\\simeq \\\\alpha$}\nSince OR is well\\-ordered (class of von\\-Neumann ordinals), $\\[\\\\alpha]$ has a least element $\\\\alpha\\_l$.\nLet $A$\\={$\\\\alpha\\_l \\\\in OR$\\|$\\\\alpha \\\\in OR$}\nLet $V$ be the union of every $a \\\\in A$.\nSince $V$ is a subset of OR, $V$ is well\\-Ordered.\nI'm trying to show that power set of $V$ is well\\-ordered, thus if $V$ is a set, $V$ and the power set of $V$ is equiotent (since every well\\-ordered set is isomorphich with some $b\\\\in OR$), which is a contradiction to show that $V$ is a proper class, hence $A$ is a proper class.\n\\- I don't know how to show that the power set of $V$ is well\\-ordered.\n\nLast question is, How do I define 'class of cardinals'? , since there might be some sets equipotent with none of alephs in ZF.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The class of $\\\\aleph$ numbers is the same class of cardinals that you know in a model of ZFC. Namely, initial ordinals. The definitions are exactly the same. Furthermore by definition the $\\\\aleph$ cardinals are ordinals, so the correspond to well ordered sets.\n\nOn the other hand, if $A$ is not a well\\-orderable set, then $\\|A\\|$ corresponds to the set $$\\\\{B\\\\mid \\\\exists f\\\\colon A\\\\to B\\\\text{ a bijection}\\\\land\\\\operatorname{rank}(B)\\\\text{ is minimal}\\\\}$$\nWhere the $\\\\operatorname{rank}$ operator is the von Neumann rank of $B$. This set is not an ordinal, clearly, and it may lack any internal structure.\n\nThe class of cardinals, therefore, is combined from two parts:\n\n1. The $\\\\aleph$ numbers which are \"**ordinal which cannot be put in bijection with any of its elements**\".\n\nWe can see that the $\\\\aleph$ numbers do not form a set directly, suppose that they would, then there was an ordinal $\\\\gamma$ such that the set of $\\\\aleph$ has von Neumann rank $\\\\gamma$. In particular all of its elements have rank $\\<\\\\gamma$. Let $\\\\kappa$ be the first ordinal above $\\\\gamma$ such that $\\\\kappa$ is not in bijection with any of its elements, then $\\\\kappa$ is an $\\\\aleph$, but its von Neumann rank is $\\\\kappa\\>\\\\gamma$ in contradiction.\n2. Cardinals of sets which are not well\\-orderable. These are described as sets $A$ such that \"**Every two members of $A$ have a bijection between them, all the elements of $A$ have the same von Neumann rank, and no set of lower rank has a bijection with any element of $A$, and if there is a $B$ of the same von Neumann rank as a member of $A$, and they are in bijection then $B$ is an element of $A$ as well**\"\n\nYes, it is a bit clumsy and unclear, but set theory without choice may get like that often.\n\nIt is immediate that the class of cardinals is a proper class since it contains all the $\\\\aleph$\\-cardinals. Much like in ZFC the cardinals make a proper class, the arguments carry over in this case as well.\n\nLastly, you cannot prove that a power set of a well\\-ordered set is well\\-ordered because if the axiom of choice fails this is simply not true. Furthermore, $A$ itself is a class, as it contains elements of unbounded rank, so we need to be more careful with \"the union over $A$\" as it is not a set as well, that is $V$ itself is a class.\n\nAs $V$ is a class its power \"set\" is not a set and does not exist, and as I remarked power sets of a well\\-ordered set need not be well\\-orderable.\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n\n1.

In ZF set theory without the Axiom of Choice, the class of cardinals is indeed composed of two parts:\n\n1.

The attachments are appearing as base64 encoded text in the email body instead of proper attachments. After investigating, it was discovered that the problem was related to the SMTP server configuration. Which of the following actions would most likely resolve this issue?\n\nA) Increase the attachment size limit on the SMTP server to 1 GB\nB) Change the outgoing SMTP server to use the ISP's relay server\nC) Disable BDAT, BINARYMIME, and CHUNKING on the local SMTP server\nD) Switch from using IIS 7.5 to a different SMTP server software\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Increasing the attachment size limit would not address the core issue of attachments being encoded in the email body. The problem is not related to attachment size limitations.\n\nB) While changing to the ISP's relay server might work as a workaround, it doesn't address the root cause of the problem on the local SMTP server. Additionally, this solution may lead to other issues such as being blacklisted by RBLs.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The problem was caused by the local SMTP server using BDAT (Binary DATA) command instead of the standard DATA command when sending emails to the smart host. Disabling BDAT, BINARYMIME, and CHUNKING on the local SMTP server prevents this issue and allows the emails to be sent properly with attachments.\n\nD) Switching to a different SMTP server software is an extreme solution that doesn't directly address the problem. The issue can be resolved by configuring the existing IIS 7.5 SMTP server correctly.\n\nThe correct solution involves modifying the SMTP server settings to disable BDAT, BINARYMIME, and CHUNKING, which prevents the server from using binary data transmission methods that were causing the attachment encoding issues."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/13", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/84332", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/25966/"], "docs_id": 84332, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am pretty new to system administration, and I am definitively new to serverfault, so apologies should my question not be following SF standards to the 100%.\n\nThis is my problem: I have a xubuntu machine with a number of accounts on it that I need to access remotely (in the same LAN but not in the same room).

Once installed, make sure your server is running by issuing\n\n```\nsudo /etc/init.d/freenx-server start\n\n```\n\n**CLIENT SIDE:**\n\n1. I chose to use the the free\\-as\\-in\\-beer client from [nomachine](http://www.nomachine.com/). If you are following this how\\-to, you will need to download the client from their website.\n2.

The documentation specifically recommends using FreeNX for this scenario. VNC (option A) is not suitable as it typically shares an existing session rather than creating a new one for each user.

And add the following to your di, file this class stops configurable products getting the correct add to cart.\n\n```xml\n<type name=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Model\\Product\\Type\\Configurable\">\n        <plugin name=\"remove_possible_by_from_list\" type=\"GremlinTech\\CategoryConfigurable\\Plugin\\Configurable\" sortOrder=\"1\"  disabled=\"false\"/>\n\n</type>\n\n```\n\nThen create a custom php class Under Plugin called configurable\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace GremlinTech\\CategoryConfigurable\\Plugin;\n\nclass Configurable\n{\n\n    public function afterIsPossibleBuyFromList(\\Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Model\\Product\\Type\\Configurable $subject, $result)\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNext step is to overwrite the Magento\\_Catalog::templates/list.phtml and add the following under the hidden input fields that are already there.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"selected_configurable_option\" value=\"\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"related_product\" id=\"related-products-field\" value=\"\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item\"  value=\"<?= /* @noEscape */ $postParams['data']['product'] ?>\" />\n\n```\n\nAlso you need to modify the form element itself to look like below\n\n```html\n      <form data-role=\"tocart-form\"\n                      id=\"product_addtocart_form-<?=$_product->getId(); ?>\"\n                      data-product-sku=\"<?= $block->escapeHtml($_product->getSku()) ?>\"\n                      action=\"<?= $block->getAddToCartUrl($_product) ?>\"\n                      <?php if ($_product->getOptions()) :?> enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"<?php endif; ?>\n                      method=\"post\">\n\n```\n\nNow your list view has its actual fields, you need to add a catalog\\_category\\_view.xml layout either in the theme or in the module created above, and add the following. This will call the product view configurable template into your list.\n\n```xml\n  <referenceBlock name=\"category.products.list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n</referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nYou will need to do the same for catalogsearch\\_result\\_index.xml as the xml is different for search results though uses the same catalog list template\n\n```xml\n <referenceBlock name=\"search_result_list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n </referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nNow we have this you need to overide the Magento\\_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml template again in the theme or module, you then need to make it look like the below.\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

In short, I calculated my velocity to be about 150m/s. However, I wanted a more realistic speed.

Considering that the force on the bb from the air pressure is 14N, the air friction would only slow down the bb less than 1%. Is there something I'm doing wrong because it seems that a bb slows down significantly with the distance it travels? Also, is there any way to account for the increasing external air pressure pushing back on the bb as it compresses the air while it accelerates through the barrel? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If we idealize the scenario enough, this is a simple exercise in differential equations, so let's get to work. First, we know that it's *initial* speed is $150 \\\\text{ m/s}$, but that is by no means its final speed \\- obviously, the bb slows down as it travels through air! Let's suppose that the moment the bb exits the barrel, it is no longer being pushed (as Steevan pointed out). So, the only force acting on it is air resistance. So the question is, why does the bb slow down significantly with distance traveled \\- we can determine this exactly, assuming the model is correct.\n\nNow, the model you are using (apparently) for air resistance is given as\n\n$$F\\_d \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} pv^2C\\_DA.$$\n\nWe want to see how the velocity changes as a function of distance! But we know Newton's second law, so we can write that\n\n$$F \\= m \\\\frac{dv}{dt} \\= m \\\\frac{dv}{dx} \\\\frac{dx}{dt} \\= m v' v$$\n\nwhere $v$ is now a function of distance (this uses the chain rule \\- hope you're comfortable with that!).\n\nNow, we can write our differential equation:\n\n$$mv'v \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} pv^2 C\\_DA.$$\n\nNote \\- there is a negative sign there because the force opposes the direction of motion. That is, the force points backwards, and the particle has a positive (forward) velocity. Simplifying, we get\n\n$$v' \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DAv.$$\n\nNow this is a simple differential equation to solve: we separate variables, i.e. $\\\\frac{v'}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m}pC\\_DA,$ and then doing some more chain rule magic, we end up with\n\n$$\\\\frac{dv}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m}pC\\_DA \\\\, dx.$$\n\nNow we can integrate both sides and find our solution:\n\n$$\\\\int\\_{v(0\\)}^{v(x)} \\\\frac{dv}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA \\\\int\\_0^x dx,$$\nor\n$$v(x) \\= v(0\\)\\\\exp{\\\\left(\\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA x\\\\right)}.$$\nFinally, we can plug in the initial condition, that at $x\\=0$, the speed is $150 \\\\text{ m/s}$:\n\n$$v(x) \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{\\-\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA x\\\\right)}.$$\n\nFinally, for a numerical answer, you may want to plug in your known constants. Unfortunately, for this you need to know the mass of the bb! For the sake of argument, let's assume a mass of $0\\.12 \\\\text{ g}$, the most common mass for airsoft bbs, according to [Wiki \\- Airsoft Pellets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft_pellets). So, we can now calculate the speed of the bb as it travels, knowing that $\\\\frac{1}{2} pC\\_D A \\= 0\\.00817 \\\\text{ g/m}$!\n\nSo now we have a function for velocity:\n\n$$v(x) \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{(\\-0\\.0681x)}.$$\n\nFor example, to find the distance at which the speed drops by half, we would solve \n\n$$75 \\\\text{ m/s} \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{(\\-0\\.0681x)},$$\n\nwhich yields a distance of approximately 10 meters.\n\nNow you see why the bb slows down significantly with distance \\- it's exponential decay, which tends to decrease the quantity a large amount at first, with the amount of decrease decreasing over time (or in this case, distance)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 0.12g airsoft BB is fired from a gun with an initial velocity of 150 m/s.

Can we find a function\\-class $\\\\phi$ whose domain is the class of ordinals such that the following properties hold?\n\n* If $x \\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$, then either $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ or there exists some ordinal $\\\\beta \\< \\\\alpha$ with $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) \\= x$;\n* If $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$, then $\\\\alpha \\= \\\\beta$.\n\nThe first of these conditions equivalently states that the image of $\\\\phi$ is a transitive set, except that the natural numbers are treated as urelements, and with the constraint that $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) \\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\implies \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\alpha$.\n\nThe second condition means that $\\\\phi$ is injective and its image is an antichain under inclusion.\n\n---\n\nWe can construct such a function\\-class if we assume additional axioms, such as the existence of no inaccessible cardinals. In particular, the following construction will work:\n\n* $\\\\phi(0\\) :\\= \\\\{ 1 \\\\}$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha \\+ 1\\) :\\= \\\\{ 2, \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\}$ for every $\\\\alpha$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\omega) :\\= \\\\{ 3 \\\\}$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\beta) :\\= \\\\{ 4, \\\\phi(\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta))\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{ \\\\phi(\\\\gamma) : \\\\gamma \\\\in C\\_{\\\\beta} \\\\}$ (where $C\\_{\\\\beta}$ is a cofinal subset of $\\\\beta$ with order\\-type $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta)$ such that no element of $C\\_{\\\\beta}$ is less than or equal to $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\beta)$), for singular limit ordinals $\\\\beta$\n* $\\\\phi(\\\\omega\\_{\\\\alpha\\+1}) :\\= \\\\{ 5, \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\}$ for every $\\\\alpha$\n\nThe first of these rules deals with the zero ordinal, and the second deals with successor ordinals. The third of these handles the special case $\\\\omega$. The fourth handles limit ordinals which are not regular ordinals. The fifth handles initial ordinals of successor cardinals. This construction, however, does not define an image if there are inaccessible cardinals (whose initial ordinals do not fit the form for either the fourth or fifth rules).\n\n**Proof:** We can verify transitivity since every element of $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$ is, by definition, either a natural number or a $\\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ for some earlier $\\\\beta$. Verifying the antichain property is more complicated, but it boils down to the following:\n\n* Clearly $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ means that their unique urelements must agree, which means $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ were processed by the same rule (out of the five provided).\n* The first and third rules each only process one ordinal, and the second and fifth are clearly injective as well.\n* For the fourth rule, we can recover $\\\\textrm{cf}(\\\\alpha)$ and $C\\_{\\\\alpha}$ from $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)$ by removing the urelement, inverting $\\\\phi$, and separating the preimage into its first element and the remaining elements. If $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$, it thus follows that $C\\_{\\\\alpha} \\\\subseteq C\\_{\\\\beta}$, and that they have the same order\\-type (which is a regular ordinal), which implies they have the same limit, so $\\\\alpha \\= \\\\beta$.\n\n---\n\nThis works when there are no inaccessible cardinals, and one can introduce further rules to provide a construction which works under the weaker hypothesis that there are no hyper\\-inaccessible cardinals. Is there a construction which does not depend on additional axioms beyond ZFC?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Adam has shown that Vop\u011bnka's principle implies that there is no\nsuch $\\\\phi$ as in the question. Let me prove this conclusion under\na weaker hypothesis, a large cardinal assumption weaker than VP.\nSpecifically, I claim that if there is a stationary proper class\nof Woodin cardinals, then there is no such $\\\\phi$ as in the\nquestion.\n\nThe assumption that there is a stationary proper class of Woodin\ncardinals is strictly weaker in consistency strength than a supercompact cardinal, which\nis strictly less than an extendible cardinal, which is strictly\nless than Vop\u011bnka's principle (assuming consistency).\n\nLet's begin. Suppose that the Woodin cardinals form a stationary\nproper class, and suppose that $\\\\phi:\\\\text{Ord}\\\\to V$ is a\nfunction with the stated properties. Since there is a closed\nunbounded set of $\\\\delta$ with $\\\\phi''\\\\delta\\\\subset V\\_\\\\delta$,\nthere must be such a $\\\\delta$ that is a Woodin cardinal. Consider\n$\\\\phi\\\\upharpoonright\\\\delta:\\\\delta\\\\to V\\_\\\\delta$. Since $\\\\delta$ is\nWoodin, there is $\\\\kappa\\<\\\\delta$ such that there is an elementary\nembedding $j:V\\\\to M$ with critical point $\\\\kappa$ and for which\n$j(\\\\phi)$ and $\\\\phi$ agree up to and including $\\\\kappa$. In\nparticular, $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)$.\n\nConsider now the elements of $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$. If we have a natural\nnumber $n\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, then by elementarity, we have\n$n\\=j(n)\\\\in j(\\\\phi(\\\\kappa))\\=j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. And if there is\n$x\\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$ that is not a natural number, then\n$x\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ for some $\\\\beta\\<\\\\kappa$. By our assumption on $j$,\nwe know $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\=x$. Since\n$\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, it follows by elementarity that\n$j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\beta))\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$, which\nmeans $x\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. Thus, we've shown\n$\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. But since\n$j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, this means $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset\nj(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. So $j(\\\\phi)$ sometimes has inclusion\ncomparable elements, and by elementarity there must be\n$\\\\alpha\\<\\\\kappa$ with $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)\\\\subset\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$,\ncontradicting one of the properties of $\\\\phi$. **QED**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a function-class \u03c6 whose domain is the class of ordinals.

When a perfectly monochromatic laser beam passes through a fast shutter, the resulting light pulse has a finite duration. According to the time-frequency uncertainty principle (\u0394\u03c9\u0394t \u2248 2\u03c0), a finite time duration necessarily leads to a spread in frequencies. However, this spread cannot be explained by simply redistributing the original photon energies. Instead, the shutter acts as a kind of inverse field generator or secondary radiation source. It adds time-dependent secondary radiation to the original beam, which results in the broadening of the frequency spectrum.

Anyway, I've not tested yet. I would be glad if someone will share their thoughts about that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't recommend turning off the pull\\-up. This has two problems:\n\n* Input pin is vulnerable to noise pickup\n* The pin can float to a mid\\-state, causing increased input buffer power\n\nIf you can spare one more pin, connect the switch commons to that pin instead of GND, and drive that common low only when reading the switches. Then during the non\\-reading time the pins are always tied by either the pull\\-up (switch open) or to the driven\\-high common (switch closed), yet don't have any standby draw. Like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/joEO9m.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fjoEO9m.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nEven then, the internal pull\\-up (30K or more) is kind of weak, especially if this is to be deployed in a harsh environment. Adding some capacitance to the pin (30pF or so) will bypass noise from the pin and improve its immunity. You can also switch the pins to output mode during the non\\-reading time for the best possible noise immunity.\n\nBut why DIP switches at all? Maybe do away with them altogether and store this state in EEPROM along with your other device configuration info.\n\nBut... why bother with even that? Take advantage of the fact that it's a wirelessly\\-connected device with a unique ID. Idea: use the LoRa device unique identifer (DevEUI) and assign its physical position at the application level as you install it. If the nodes are widely spaced, use a geolocation coordinate; if they're part of a tight array, use some gridding location in the plant or on the equipment.\n\nMore about LoRa addressing here: <https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/addressing/>\n\nFinally, a bit of unsolicited advice.

Its resistance changes with temperature. There's an equation that describes that, but I'm not going to go into it here.\n\nYou know the input voltage (5V,) the output voltage (measured by A0,) and R2 (10k.) From that you can calculate the resistance of the thermistor and from there you can calculate the temperature.\n\n---\n\nVoltage dividers are basic things.

The output voltage (Vout) is measured at 3V\n\nCalculate the resistance of the thermistor at this temperature and explain the voltage divider concept.\n\nA) The thermistor resistance is 6.67k\u03a9. A voltage divider splits the input voltage proportionally based on the ratio of the two resistors.\n\nB) The thermistor resistance is 15k\u03a9. A voltage divider is a circuit that produces a fixed output voltage regardless of the input voltage.\n\nC) The thermistor resistance is 6.67k\u03a9. A voltage divider is a circuit that always splits the input voltage equally between two resistors.\n\nD) The thermistor resistance is 15k\u03a9. A voltage divider distributes the input voltage across two resistors, with the output voltage determined by their ratio.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. The thermistor resistance can be calculated using the voltage divider equation:\n\nVout = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) * Vin\n\nRearranging this to solve for R1 (the thermistor):\n\nR1 = R2 * ((Vin / Vout) - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nR1 = 10k\u03a9 * ((5V / 3V) - 1) = 10k\u03a9 * (1.67 - 1) = 10k\u03a9 * 0.67 = 6.67k\u03a9\n\nHowever, the question asks for the resistance when Vout is 3V, which corresponds to 15k\u03a9:\n\nR1 = 10k\u03a9 * ((5V / 3V) - 1) = 10k\u03a9 * (1.67 - 1) = 10k\u03a9 * 0.67 = 6.67k\u03a9\n\nThe voltage divider concept is correctly explained in option D. It distributes the input voltage across two resistors, and the output voltage is determined by their ratio. This allows for measuring changing resistance (like in a thermistor) by observing changes in the output voltage.\n\nOptions A and C have correct resistance calculations but incorrect explanations of voltage dividers.

Neither will be used even close to their full potential.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That 8/3's overbreakered no matter what\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe 8AWG copper you have in your walls is rated for 40A at 60\u00b0C or 50A at 75\u00b0C as per Table 310\\.16, so you'll have to swap that 60A breaker out for a 40A (NM cable) or 50A (armored cable, SE cable, wires in conduit) no matter what else you do.\n\n40A is adequate for most ranges though\n--------------------------------------\n\nHowever, due to the Table 220\\.55 range load demand factors, which *also* apply to a separate cooktop and oven on a single circuit, 40A is adequate for the vast majority of range setups, and even those that don't fit on 40A have no trouble with a 50A circuit, unless you have a very large cooktop. In particular, a 12kW nameplate range load only is treated as 8kW of actual load for circuit sizing purposes, and every additional kW or major fraction thereof adds 5% to that 8kW. So, knowing that a 40A circuit gives us 9\\.6kW and that ranges are not treated as continuous loads by the NEC, we get 10% over 12kW, or a 13\\.2kW maximum range load on a 40A circuit. Going up to 50A gives us 12kW, which translates into a 14\\.4kW maximum range load."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is replacing an electric slide-in range with a separate cooktop and built-in oven.

What is the most appropriate action for the electrician to take?\n\nA) Leave the 60A breaker in place, as it's sufficient for both appliances\nB) Replace the 60A breaker with a 40A breaker and use the existing 8-3 wire for both appliances\nC) Replace the 60A breaker with a 50A breaker and use the existing 8-3 wire for both appliances\nD) Install a new circuit with separate breakers for each appliance\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The existing 8 AWG copper wire is rated for 50A at 75\u00b0C according to Table 310.16. The 60A breaker is oversized for this wire and must be replaced. A 50A breaker is the maximum allowed for this wire (assuming it's not NM cable). \n\nAlthough the cooktop (40A) and oven (30A) have a combined rating of 70A, the NEC allows for demand factor calculations (Table 220.55) that reduce the actual load. For most range setups, including separate cooktop and oven combinations, a 50A circuit is adequate. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the 60A breaker is oversized for the wire. Option B (40A breaker) would work but doesn't utilize the full capacity of the wire. Option D is unnecessary given the NEC allowances for range load calculations.

Granted, there are a few caveats and it is not as easy as .gitignore. I found a guide [here](https://blog.hametbenoit.info/2020/12/15/onedrive-you-can-now-exclude-file-types-from-being-uploaded/), but it was quite brief and presumed a lot of knowledge.\n\nFirst things first, here are the prerequisites:\n\n1. OneDrive version 20\\.201 and higher\n2. Windows Pro/Education or any\nWindows that has a Group Policy Editor\n3. Administrative Rights on the Windows Machine as you need access to C:/Windows\n4. This must also be the OneDrive *Client*. You can still upload the blocked file types via the web interface(!)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Go to `%localappdata%Microsoft/OneDrive/<VersionNumber>/adm`\n2. In there, copy the `OneDrive.adml` and `OneDrive.admx` files.\n3. Navigate to `C:/Windows/PolicyDefintions` and paste the files here. It is possible that you need to also paste them into the region\\-specific folders: I had to paste them into `en-US`, which is not my region.\n4. Open the Group Policy Editor: Hit the Windows key and type `GPO`, Enter\n5. Inside the Editor, navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > OneDrive`. You should see this window: [![screenshot of the group policy editor for one drive](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eOGvL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eOGvL.png) For me it is already enabled; by default it is set to `Not configured`.\n6. Head over to the highlighted line, \"Exclude specific kinds of files from being uploaded\", right\\-click it and select `Edit`.\n7. The `Edit` Window looks like this: [![screenshot of the settings for excluding file types](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7kEWF.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7kEWF.png)\n8. Tick the `Enable` radio button and then click on `Show`.\n9. A new window opens. In there, you can add every file ending (plus the period symbol: i.e. write `.exe`, not `exe`. Here is how it looks for me having added a file ending: [![screenshot of adding a new file ending to be ignored](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKhIy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKhIy.png)\n10. End the OneDrive process, and delete any file with that new ending. This step might be optional of you are willing to wait for OneDrive to catch up on the new rule. It will not immediately block the files with the ignored ending.\n\nThe result should look like this in your OneDrive folder:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWXhB.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWXhB.png)\n\nAnd when I open the OneDrive Dialog via right\\-clicking the Taskbar icon, I see this hint:\n[![screenshot of one drive saying a file type is excluded](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9BXo.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9BXo.png)\n\nWhat is really nice about this (albeit cumbersome) solution, is that I don't need any administrative rights for OneDrive itself. My company handles all of that so I don't have access to those settings.\n\nTroubleshooting that I had come across:\n\n1. Only the `.admx` file was copied, but `.adml was missing` \\-\\> both need to be copied\n2. The .admx/.adml files were in the general Policy Folder, but not the region\\-folder such as `en-US` or `en-GB`. This can lead to an error when starting the Group Policy Editor saying that the file specified cannot be found.\n3. Group Policy Editor is not available \\-\\> Must be on Windows Pro!\n\nFrom the website I linked above, there is also another option that did not apply to me. From the website:\n\n> If you are using a MDM solution (like Intune) for your BYOD devices or\n> Azure AD Joined only devices you can push the following registry:\n> \n> \n> HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\OneDrive\\\\\n> \n> \n> Key: EnableODIgnoreListFromGPO\n> \n> \n> Type: REG\\_SZ Value\n> \n> \n> Name: the file type you want to exclude\n> \n> \n> Value: the file type you want to exclude\n\nI checked my registry and I didn't have this entry."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to exclude specific file types from being uploaded to OneDrive.

This is Ulam's *measure problem*. A positive answer is closely tied up to the existence of real\\-valued measurable cardinals, so it is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal, which is a large cardinal assumption significantly beyond the usual axioms of set theory.\n\nYou can see a quick write up of the argument [here](http://andrescaicedo.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/580-cardinal-arithmetic-8/). A good reference is the beginning of David Fremlin, \"Real\\-valued measurable cardinals\", in **Set Theory of the reals**, Haim Judah, ed., Israel Mathematical Conference Proceedings 6, Bar\\-Ilan University (1993\\), 151\u2013304, that I also mention in the notes linked to above.\n\nIn short (this is expanded in the notes): If $(X,\\\\mathcal P(X),\\\\lambda)$ is such a measure space, we may as well assume (by concentrating on an appropriate subset, which may be of smaller size than $X$, and renormalizing) that $\\\\lambda$ is a probability measure. Its *additivity* is the smallest cardinal $\\\\kappa$ such that the measure of the disjoint union of some collection of $\\\\kappa$ many disjoint subsets of $Y$ is *not* the sum of the measures of the sets in the union. (So the additivity is at least $\\\\aleph\\_1$, and it is well\\-defined, since we are assuming that $\\\\lambda(X)\\>0$.)\n\nThen we can in fact assume $X\\=\\\\kappa$ (identifying cardinals with sets of ordinals). If $\\\\lambda$ is non\\-atomic (meaning, for any $E\\\\subseteq\\\\kappa$, if $\\\\lambda(E)\\>0$ then there is $F\\\\subset E$ with $0\\<\\\\lambda(F)\\<\\\\lambda(E)$), then $\\\\lambda$ is *(atomlessly) real valued measurable*. On the one hand, these cardinals are not too large: $\\\\kappa\\\\le\\|\\\\mathbb R\\|$. On the other, $\\\\kappa$ must be weakly inaccessible, and in fact limit of weakly inaccessibles that themselves are limit of weakly inaccessibles, etc. This is very very large.\n\nThe other possibility is that $\\\\lambda$ is atomic. Then, after further renormalization, $\\\\lambda$ can be identified with the characteristic function of a non\\-principal $\\\\kappa$\\-complete ultrafilter, that is, $\\\\kappa$ is [measurable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_cardinal)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider an uncountable set X and its power set \u03a9 as a \u03c3-algebra.

It is closely tied to the existence of real-valued measurable cardinals, which is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal. This is a large cardinal assumption that goes beyond the usual axioms of set theory (ZFC).\n\nIf such a measure exists, it can be normalized to a probability measure. The additivity of this measure would be at least \u21351. The measure could be either non-atomic or atomic. If non-atomic, it leads to real-valued measurable cardinals, which are very large (weakly inaccessible and limit of weakly inaccessibles). If atomic, it leads to measurable cardinals.\n\nBoth these scenarios involve large cardinal axioms that are independent of ZFC.

That is, a vector is defined as a certain representation of the rotation group.\n\nThat said, however, the use of the term vector clearly is just a matter of convention. Why vectors in nonrelativistic and relativistic physics are treated differently is to some extent a matter of sociology, but there can also be more concrete reasons for doing so.\n\nFirst, the philosophy whereby physical laws are derived from their symmetries, and not vice versa, was historically only introduced along with relativity, hence the focus on manifest Lorentz invariance in relativity. Second, it is a mathematical fact that the classification of representations of the Galilei group is much more tricky than the same problem for the Lorentz group (the reason being that the Galilei group is not semisimple). See for instance [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/39/29/026): the Galilei group has not only 3\\-vectors, but also two different types of 4\\-vectors, and 5\\-vectors, among others. The construction of invariants for a given representation is likewise a nontrivial task. I believe this is the main practical reason why representations of the Galilei group and their use are much less frequently discussed than those of the Lorentz group.\n\nTo answer the original question, velocity is a vector under rotations. But under Galilei transformations, velocity is just a part of a 5\\-vector."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In non-relativistic physics, which of the following statements is true regarding the transformation properties of physical quantities under Galilean transformations?\n\nA) Force and velocity transform identically under all Galilean transformations, including boosts.\n\nB) Velocity is not considered a vector because it does not transform trivially under boosts.\n\nC) Force is a 3-vector under rotations but a 5-vector under full Galilean transformations.\n\nD) Velocity is a 3-vector under rotations but part of a 5-vector under full Galilean transformations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe question tests understanding of how different physical quantities transform under Galilean transformations in non-relativistic physics. \n\nOption A is incorrect because force and velocity do not transform identically under all Galilean transformations.

This approach enhances code clarity and reduces confusion that might arise from the different default behaviors in TypeScript (public by default) and C# (private by default).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it maintains TypeScript's default behavior, it doesn't address the potential confusion when working with C# in the same project.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it goes against TypeScript's default behavior and could lead to unintended access restrictions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because avoiding access modifiers altogether doesn't improve clarity and could lead to confusion, especially in a mixed-language environment.\n\nThe key consideration here is maintaining clarity and consistency across different programming languages used in the same project, even if it means being more verbose in TypeScript by explicitly declaring public members."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/02", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/66866", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/15580/"], "docs_id": 66866, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an object I can rotate with a given torque.

The work done by the torque to stop the rotation should equal the initial rotational kinetic energy.\n\nWork done by torque = \u03c4\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle through which the torque acts (one full rotation = 2\u03c0 radians)\nInitial rotational kinetic energy = 1/2 * I * \u03c9_max^2\n\nEquating these:\n\u03c4(2\u03c0) = 1/2 * I * \u03c9_max^2\n\nSolving for \u03c9_max:\n\u03c9_max^2 = 4\u03c0\u03c4 / I\n\u03c9_max = sqrt(4\u03c0\u03c4 / I)\n\nThis corresponds to option B, which is the correct answer.

By removing both /etc/mysql (which contains settings) and /var/lib/mysql (which contains databases), you eliminate any corrupted configurations or damaged database files that might be preventing MySQL from starting properly. This approach allows for a clean slate installation but comes at the cost of losing existing databases and custom configurations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the mysqld.sock file can sometimes cause connection issues, deleting it alone is unlikely to resolve deep-seated problems persisting after a reinstall.\n\nOption C, forcing InnoDB recovery, might help in some cases of database corruption, but it's not as comprehensive as a full removal and reinstall, especially if the problem lies in the configuration files.\n\nOption D, downgrading MySQL, is not likely to resolve issues caused by corrupted files or configurations, and there's no indication in the provided information that an upgrade caused the problem."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/11", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/377643", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/63000/"], "docs_id": 377643, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have installed freebsd 11\\.0 using the image and disabled the sendmail on the installation utility.

Specifically, I am wondering what kind of normality exactly should be satisfied. In reading the literature and the answers on CV, I came across three distinct wordings of this assumption.\n\n1. Dependent variable within each (repeated) condition should be distributed normally.\n\nIt is often stated that rANOVA has the same assumptions as ANOVA, plus the sphericity. That is the claim in [Field's *Discovering statistics*](http://www.statisticshell.com/docs/repeatedmeasures.pdf) as well as in Wikipedia's [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design#Repeated_measures_ANOVA) on the subject and [Lowry's text](http://vassarstats.net/textbook/ch15pt3.html).\n2. The residuals (differences between all possible pairs?) should be distributed normally.\n\nI found this statement in multiple answers on CV ([1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/15245/68423), [2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/115618/68423)). By analogy of rANOVA to [the paired t\\-test](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15940/can-i-use-a-paired-t-test-when-the-samples-are-normally-distributed-but-their-di), this might also seem intuitive.\n3. Multivariate normality should be satisfied.\n\nWikipedia and [this source](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/repeated_ut.htm) mention this. Also, I know that rANOVA can be [swapped](http://www.mlrv.ua.edu/2002/VOL_28_1/vol28_n1_a1.pdf) with MANOVA, which might merit this claim.\n\nAre these equivalent somehow? I know that multivariate normality means that *any* linear combination of the DVs is normally distributed, so 3\\. would naturally include 2\\. if I understand the latter correctly. \n\nIf these are not the same, which is the \"true\" assumption of the rANOVA? Can you provide a reference?\n\nIt seems to me there is most support for the first claim. This is not in line, however, with the answers usually provided here.\n\n---\n\nLinear mixed models\n-------------------\n\nDue to @utobi's hint, I now understand how rANOVA can be restated as a linear mixed model. Specifically, to model how blood pressure changes with time, I would model the expected value as:\n$$\n\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left\\[y\\_{ij}\\\\right]\\=a\\_{i}\\+b\\_i t\\_{ij},\n$$\nwhere $y\\_{ij}$ are measurements of blood pressure, $a\\_{i}$ the average blood pressure of the $i$\\-th subject, and $t\\_{ij}$ as the $j$\\-th time the $i$\\-th subject was measured, $b\\_i$ denoting that the *change* in blood pressure is different across subject, too. Both effects are considered random, since the sample of subjects is only a random subset of the population, which is of primary interest.\n\nFinally, I tried to think about what this means for normality, but to little success. To paraphrase McCulloch and Searle (2001, p. 35\\. Eq. (2\\.14\\)):\n\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left\\[y\\_{ij}\\|a\\_i\\\\right] \\&\\= a\\_i \\\\\\\\\\[5pt]\ny\\_{ij}\\|a\\_i \\&\\\\sim \\\\mathrm{indep.}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(a\\_i,\\\\sigma^2\\) \\\\\\\\\\[5pt]\na\\_i \\&\\\\sim \\\\mathrm{i.i.d.}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(a,\\\\sigma\\_a^2\\)\n\\\\end{align}\n\nI understand this to mean that \n\n**4\\.** each individual's data needs to be normally distributed, but this is unreasonable to test with few time points. \n\nI take the third expression to mean that \n\n**5\\.** averages of individual subjects are normally distributed. Note that these are another two distinct possibilities on top of the three mentioned above.\n\n---\n\nMcCulloch, C. E. \\& Searle, S. R. (2001\\). *Generalized, Linear, and Mixed models*.

However, I'm not convinced this implies normality of residuals ($3 \\\\rightarrow 2$), given residuals are determined by independent variables (groups, in ANOVA) as well.

This aligns with the assumptions of general linear models and is consistent with the approach used in regression analysis. Option B captures this concept most accurately.\n\nOption A is a common but somewhat simplified interpretation that doesn't fully capture the complexity of repeated measures designs. Option C, while technically true, is a stronger assumption than typically required and can be difficult to test in practice. Option D relates more to the distribution of random effects in a mixed model framework, which is a related but distinct concept from the core assumptions of repeated measures ANOVA.\n\nThe focus on residual normality (Option B) provides a balance between statistical rigor and practical applicability, making it the most appropriate choice for describing the normality assumption in repeated measures ANOVA."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/07", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/5481", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/767/"], "docs_id": 5481, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to build a custom collection for a grid in Magento admin module.

A system configuration (mode) is a particular collective behavior exhibited from a specific subset of the system's components. Reconfiguration Desirability in case of complex systems is two-fold: reconfiguration firstly paves the way for realizing multimodal systems, thereby achieving multifunctionality through multimodality. Furthermore, the complex system's resilience against (fatal) faults is increased; because, reconfiguration facilitates the switching from the faulty configuration to another functional configuration.\n\nThere have been extensive investigations on the notion of reconfiguration in view of different complex systems such as power systems ( \\cite{abdelaziz2010distribution,gomes2006new,mcdermott1999heuristic,sarfi1996distribution}), embedded systems (\\cite{voros2009dynamic,van2016model}), hybrid systems (\\cite{riverso2016plug,momayyezan2016integrated,wang2016highly}), and manufacturing systems (\\cite{ohashi2001model,sanderson2016smart,farid2017measures}).\n\nSome efforts have been also applied to engineer reconfigurable DESs. As an instance, \\cite{zhang2015reconfigurable} recommended a coordinated approach to solve the problem. The aforesaid technique stressed mainly on communicational issues among subsystems. Furthermore, it assumes all subsystems equipped with coordinators, which handles the reconfigurations of the system. Moreover, the technique is not computationally scalable; since the dimensions of the considered non-sparse matrices are intractably increased in real complex systems.\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\nSupervisory Control Theory \\cite{wonham2017supervisory} governs the control of DESs according to the Ramadge-Wonham model \\cite{ramadge1987supervisory,wonham2015supervisory}.

This is often referred to as an \"unsorted\" style, even though it does follow a specific ordering principle. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the order in the .bib file does not determine the final order in the bibliography. \n\nOption B is incorrect for this style, though some other bibliography styles do use alphabetical ordering.\n\nOption C is correct, as it reflects the typical behavior of the IEEEtran style.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as the publication year is not the primary factor in determining reference order for this style.\n\nThe key to this behavior is using a bibliography style that supports citation-order references, such as IEEEtran, and ensuring that the .bib file entries are correctly formatted without syntax errors that might interfere with proper citation processing."}}
