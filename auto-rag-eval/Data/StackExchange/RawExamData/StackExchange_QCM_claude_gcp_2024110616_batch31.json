This answer is correct because:\n\n1. FME Desktop is specifically mentioned in the documentation as a tool capable of converting shapefiles to AutoCAD blocks.\n2. The image provided shows an FME workspace designed for this exact purpose, demonstrating its capability and suitability.\n3. FME allows for the creation of custom workflows, which can handle complex attribute mapping and block generation, addressing the need to convert multiple details into block attributes.\n4. Using FME provides a repeatable and easily modifiable process, allowing for future automation and adjustments as project requirements change.\n5. FME's visual interface for creating data transformation workflows makes it more accessible and easier to maintain than coding solutions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manual conversion is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable for large datasets or repeated tasks. Option C, while potentially viable, requires significant custom coding and may be less flexible or user-friendly than FME for non-programmers.

The correct answer is C because the key to applying Gauss's law correctly is to consider the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, not the size of the surface itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as explained in the documentation, the electric field contributions from charges outside the Gaussian surface do not affect the flux through the closed surface. These external fields enter and exit the surface, resulting in a net zero contribution.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on a common misconception. Gauss's law is valid for any charge distribution, uniform or non-uniform, as long as the total enclosed charge is considered.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it's true that the external fields cancel out, this isn't the source of the student's problem. The issue lies in the incorrect application of Gauss's law, not measurement precision.\n\nThe correct approach would be to use a Gaussian surface that fully encloses the charge distribution up to the point where the electric field is being measured (r < R).

The game involves frequent, small updates to player positions and actions. Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for implementing the network communication layer?\n\nA) Use a single TCP socket per client, sending continuous streams of data for all game updates\nB) Implement multiple UDP sockets per client, each dedicated to a specific type of game update\nC) Use a combination of TCP for critical data and UDP for frequent, less critical updates\nD) Implement a custom protocol on top of raw IP packets, bypassing socket abstractions entirely\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of networking concepts in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, demonstrates an understanding of the trade-offs between TCP and UDP protocols, and how they can be applied in a game development context.\n\nTCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of data streams, which is suitable for critical game data that must not be lost (e.g., player actions, game state changes). However, TCP's overhead for ensuring reliability can introduce latency, which is undesirable for real-time games.\n\nUDP, on the other hand, offers lower latency but doesn't guarantee delivery or order of packets. This makes it suitable for frequent, less critical updates like player positions, where occasional packet loss is acceptable and can be compensated for by subsequent updates.\n\nOption A (using only TCP) would ensure reliability but might introduce too much latency for a real-time game. Option B (using only UDP) might lead to inconsistencies in critical game state. Option D (custom protocol on raw IP) is unnecessarily complex and would require reimplementing many features that sockets already provide.\n\nThe combination approach in option C leverages the strengths of both TCP and UDP, allowing the game to balance reliability and low latency based on the specific needs of different types of game data. This solution requires understanding of both socket types, their characteristics, and how they can be applied in a real-world application, demonstrating higher-level thinking and integration of multiple networking concepts."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/04", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/23775", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/5047/"], "docs_id": 23775, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm developing a web application.

This is likely due to the Android system's memory management, which may be more aggressive with newly installed apps.\n\nMoving the wakelock acquisition to a foreground service is the best approach because:\n\n1.

Every log message is flushed because we need to have a record of what occurred leading up to a crash. My colleagues and I were curious about how to achieve the performance effects of buffering while guaranteeing that the log message had left the process.\n\nWhat we came\\-up with is:\n\n* make a FIFO that the application can write to, and\n* redirect the contents of that FIFO to a regular file via `cat`.\n\nThat is, what was ordinarily:\n\n```\napp --logfile logfile.txt\n\n```\n\nis now:\n\n```\nmkfifo logfifo\ncat logfifo &> logfile.txt &\napp --logfile logfifo\n\n```\n\n**Are there any gotchas to this approach?** It worked when we tested it, but we want to make absolutely sure that the messages will find their way to the redirect file even if the original application crashes.\n\n(We don't have the source code to the application, so programming solutions are out of the question. Also, the application won't write to `stdout`, so piping directly to a different command is out of the question. So `syslog` is not a possibility.)\n\n---\n\n**Update:** I've added a bounty. The accepted answer will **not** involve `logger` for the simple reason that `logger` is **not** what I've asked about. As the original question states, I am only looking for gotchas in using a FIFO.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note that a fifo is typically necessary in programming where the amount written in can surpass the amount read out.\n\nAs such a fifo wont work entirely smoothly as you anticipate but would solve your main problem whilst introducing another.\n\nThere are three possible caveats.\n\n1. Writing to the fifo is blocked indefinitely if nothing is reading the other end at initialization.\n2. The fifo has a fixed width of 64K by which if the buffer is filled by that point further writes will block until the reader has caught up.\n3. The pipe writer will by killed with SIGPIPE if the reader dies or exits.\n\nThis will mean that your problem (emulate buffered I/O on a non\\-buffered write) will be resolved. That is because the new 'limit' on your FIFO will in effect become the speed of whatever utility is writing what is in the pipe to disk (which presumably will be buffered I/O).\n\nNevertheless, the writer becomes dependant on your log reader to function. If the reader stops suddently reading, the writer will block. If the reader suddenly exits (lets say you run out of disk space on your target) the writer will SIGPIPE and probably exit.\n\nAnother point to mention is if the server panics and the kernel stops responding you may lose up to 64k of data that was in that buffer.\n\nAnother way to fix this will be to write logs to tmpfs (/dev/shm on linux) and tail the output to a fixed disk location. There are less restrictive limits on memory allocation doing this (not 64K, typically 2G!) but might not work for you if the writer has no dynamic way to reopen logfiles (you would have to clean out the logs from tmpfs periodically). If the server panics in this method you could lose a LOT more data."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A development team is using a FIFO (named pipe) to improve logging performance for a third-party application that requires immediate flushing of log messages.

The correct answer is D because it represents the most significant risk to the reliability of the logging approach.\n\nIf the log reader process (cat) is manually terminated while the application is running, it triggers several issues:\n\n1. As mentioned in the documentation, \"The pipe writer will be killed with SIGPIPE if the reader dies or exits.\" This means the application writing to the FIFO will likely terminate unexpectedly, potentially causing data loss or system instability.\n\n2. Even if the application doesn't terminate, it will block on further write attempts to the FIFO, as stated: \"Writing to the fifo is blocked indefinitely if nothing is reading the other end.\" This effectively halts the logging process and may cause the application to hang.\n\n3. This scenario bypasses the 64K buffer limit mentioned, potentially leading to more extensive data loss than a simple crash or power failure.\n\nOption A is less problematic because the FIFO and cat process would still capture and write the messages to the log file, even if the application crashes immediately after.\n\nOption B could cause issues, but it's less severe than D. The cat process might fail, but it wouldn't immediately impact the application's ability to write to the FIFO.\n\nOption C (power failure) could result in loss of buffered data, but it's a risk inherent to any logging system and not specific to this FIFO approach.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex system, understand the interactions between processes, and identify the most critical point of failure in the proposed logging architecture."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/22", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/299696", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/98677/"], "docs_id": 299696, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need help with clustering algorithm.

From my understanding of the Geohash algorithm you can't just select all the points inside a given bounding box by simple string comparison.\n\nThis image might help understanding it a bit better:\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6LYk.jpg)  \n\n(image from [http://www.movable\\-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg))\n\nIf you have a bounding box going covering a region in Canada for instance within the `c` and `f` regions, string comparison would necessarily select regions in `d` and `e` regions as well, which are geographically at a very different place. So if you are able to design a correct query, it would probably be close to a Geohash decoding algorithm which is computationally quite expensive for big data sets.\n\nFor your question regarding a simple clustering algorithm, the problem is similar. Clustering algorithms all work based on some distance metrics. And a Geohash does not provide a generic way for conveniently computing the geographical distance between two far\\-away hashes.\n\nHowever there are probably two paths you can take.\n\nOne option is to store your data (maybe additionally to the Geohash format, depending on your requirements), in simple indexed lat and lng columns, or as geometries (with a spatial index). In the case of using geometries, you can use the [Spatial Relation Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html) in MySQL (e.g. `MBRContains`).\n\nThe other option is if you only want to cluster the markers in Leaflet, similarly to the Leaflet MarkerClusterer, you could just group by the first character in the Geohash for zoom level 0\\. For more fine grained clustering, you might need more computation and be better off with the previous option."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about geohashing and clustering algorithms, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A developer is implementing a map-based application that needs to efficiently cluster 60,000 markers across various zoom levels.

When doing OOP, every language I've used implements some kind of access restriction. I like some access models better than others.\n\nI am on a team of Java developers. Our projects spend time in code reviews considering the access modifiers, their appropriateness, and the use of things like @VisibleForTesting (a Java annotation). Our projects also occasionally spend time de\\-finalizing or de\\-privatizing something in a 3rd party library if a source\\-code change is not feasible.\n\nI went looking for the research that shows how the use of access modifiers affects defect density or occurrences of run\\-time errors. I cannot find any studies on it. Maybe my Google\\-Fu is weak. What is the evidence that access modifiers actually provide the benefits we assume they do? Where are the studies that quantify the problems with how access modifiers are used?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me give you a real world example of when access modifiers \"mattered\" that I ran into personally:\n\nOur software is primarily python, and one way that python differs from most other OO languages is that there are no explicit access modifiers. Instead, it is convention to prefix methods and attributes that should be private with an underscore.\n\nOne day, a developer was working on a particular feature, and could not make it work with the interface of the object he was working with. But he noticed that if he worked with a particular attribute that was marked private, he could do what he wanted to do. So he did it, checked it in, and (unfortunately) it slipped past code review, and into the master branch.\n\nFast forward two years. That developer had moved on. We updated to a newer version of an underlying library. Code that had been reliably suddenly stopped working. This resulted in lots of debugging and back\\-and\\-forth messages with another team in a different time zone. \n\nEventually we figured out the issue: the developers who owned that underlying object changed the way it worked in a very subtle way. Subtle enough that no exceptions were thrown, no other errors occurred. The library just became flaky. This happened because the developers of that library had no clue that they were doing anything that would cause any troubles to anyone. They were changing something internal, not the interface.\n\nSo after the fact we did what should have been done originally: we asked the library developers to add a public method that solved our problem rather than mucking about with the internals of their objects.\n\nSo that's what access modifiers prevent. They ensure that the separation of interface and implementation is clear. It lets users know exactly what they can do with the class safely and lets developers of the class change internals without breaking user's software.\n\nYou could do this all with convention, not force, as python shows, but even where it's just convention, having that public/private separation is a great boon toward maintainability."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is debating whether to refactor a critical module to use stricter access modifiers.

The example provided illustrates how access modifiers support the separation of interface and implementation, allowing developers to change internals without breaking users' software. \n\nOption A is incorrect because access modifiers primarily affect code organization and maintainability, not runtime performance. \n\nOption B is misleading; while access modifiers can contribute to security, they're not primarily designed for protection against external attacks. \n\nOption D overstates the capabilities of access modifiers; they don't automatically detect logical errors but rather help prevent certain types of unintended usage.\n\nThe scenario in C reflects the real-world example where developers of a library changed something internal, causing issues for code that inappropriately accessed private members. Stricter access modifiers would have prevented this by clearly defining the public interface, allowing internal changes without affecting external code.

This method avoids the need to extract files to disk, which can be slow and resource-intensive, especially for large files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because gpd.read_file() cannot directly read from an InMemoryUploadedFile object containing a zip file, as evidenced by the \"no driver\" error in the question.\n\nOption B, while functional, is less efficient as it requires writing temporary files to disk, which can be slow and problematic in web applications with concurrent users.\n\nOption D is incorrect because StringIO is not suitable for binary data like zipped shapefiles, and gpd.read_file() expects either a file path or an object with specific GIS-related methods.\n\nThe correct approach (C) uses fiona.io.ZipMemoryFile to create a virtual file from the in-memory zip data.

Which of the following approaches would most effectively resolve the spacing problem while maintaining the use of both KOMA-Script and enumitem?\n\nA) Replace the amsthm package with ntheorem to avoid conflicts with enumitem\nB) Use the ignoredisplayed option when loading the enumitem package\nC) Manually adjust the \\topsep and \\bottomsep values for each theorem environment\nD) Switch from scrartcl to a standard article class to eliminate KOMA-Script interactions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because using the ignoredisplayed option when loading the enumitem package is the most effective and straightforward solution to the spacing issue. This option is specifically designed as a workaround for problems like the one described, where enumitem's redefinition of trivlist interacts poorly with KOMA-Script's list handling.\n\nOption A is incorrect because replacing amsthm with ntheorem doesn't address the root cause of the problem, which is the interaction between enumitem and KOMA-Script, not amsthm.\n\nOption C, while potentially workable, is a less efficient solution that would require manual adjustments for each theorem environment, making it more prone to errors and less maintainable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because switching from scrartcl to a standard article class would unnecessarily remove the benefits of using KOMA-Script, when the issue can be resolved while keeping KOMA-Script.\n\nThe ignoredisplayed option prevents enumitem from applying its list-related modifications to displayed environments like theorems, effectively restoring the expected spacing behavior.

This method, demonstrated in the provided code snippet, offers several advantages:\n\n1. It analyzes the model's performance across various threshold values, providing a comprehensive view of its discriminative ability.\n2. The AUC gives a single metric for overall model performance, with higher values indicating better discrimination between classes.\n3. Finding the cutoff value closest to the (0,1) point on the ROC curve (perfect classification) helps determine the optimal threshold that balances true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1 - specificity).\n4. This approach accounts for the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at different thresholds, which is crucial for optimizing classification performance.\n\nThe other options are less effective:\nA) Using the midpoint between mean NDVI values oversimplifies the classification problem and doesn't account for overlap in NDVI distributions.\nC) Applying a fixed threshold of 0.5 is arbitrary and doesn't consider the specific characteristics of the data or optimize performance.\nD) While a t-test can identify significant differences between distributions, it doesn't provide a comprehensive evaluation of classification performance across different thresholds.\n\nThe ROC curve approach integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including feature collection manipulation, reduction operations, and charting, making it a more sophisticated and effective method for model evaluation in this real-world scenario."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/27", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/104115", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/155544/"], "docs_id": 104115, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This has always been a problem with Facebook questions but it's much more pronounced now that SO is the official home of Facebook developer support.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The [polygon] tag is established for \"creation, manipulation and rendering of polygons in graphical user interfaces,\" which covers the geometric aspect of the question.\n\n2. The proposed [polygon-blockchain] tag would be the most appropriate for blockchain-related questions, as it clearly distinguishes from the geometric [polygon] tag and reflects the current branding of the blockchain (formerly Matic).\n\n3. Using [matic] (A) would be incorrect as it's proposed to become a synonym of [polygon-blockchain] and refers to the outdated branding.\n\n4.

The differences Zi are assumed to be independent.\n2. (a.) Each Zi comes from the same continuous population, and (b.) each Zi is symmetric about a common median;\n3. The values which Xi and Yi represent are ordered...so the comparisons 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to' are useful.\n\nThe documentation for ?wilcox.test in R, however, seem to indicate that (2\\.b) is actually something that is tested by the procedure:\n\n\"...if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a Wilcoxon signed rank test of the null that the distribution ... of x \\- y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed.\"\n\nThis sounds to me as though the test is performed for the null hypothesis that \"Z is distributed symetrically around median mu\\=SomeMu\" \\-\\- such that rejection fo the null could be *either* a rejection of the symmetry *or* a rejection that the mu around which Z is symmetric is SomeMu.\n\nIs this a correct understanding of the R documentation for wilcox.test? The reason this is important, of course, is that I am conducting a number of paired\\-difference tests on some before\\-and\\-after data (\"X\" and \"Y\" above). The \"before\" and \"after\" data individually are highly skewed, but the differences are not skewed nearly as much (although still skewed somewhat). By that I mean that the \"before\" or \"after\" data considered alone has skewness \\~7 to 21 (depending on the sample I am looking at), while the \"differences\" data has skewness \\~\\= 0\\.5 to 5\\. Still skewed, but not nearly as much. \n\nIf having skewness in my \"differences\" data will cause the Wilcoxon test to give me false/biased results (as the Wikipedia article seems to indicate), then skewness could be a big concern. If, however, the Wilcoxon tests are actually testing whether the differences distribution is \"symmetric around mu\\=SomeMu\" (as ?wilcox.test seems to indicate) then this is less of a concern.\n\nThus my questions are:\n\n1. Which interpretation above is correct? Is skewness in my \"differences\" distribution going to bias my Wilcoxon test?\n2. If skewness *is* a concern: \"How much skewness is a concern?\"\n3. If the Wilcoxon signed rank tests seem grossly inappropriate here, any suggestions for what I should use?\n\nThanks so much. If you have any further suggestions about how I might do this analysis I am more than happy to hear them (although I can also open another thread for that purpose). Also, this is my first question on Cross Validated; if you have suggestions/comments on how I asked this question, I am open to that as well!\n\n---\n\nA little background: I am analyzing a dataset that contains observations on what I'll call \"errors in firm production.\" I have an observation on errors occuring in the production process before and after a surprise inspection, and one of the goals of the analysis is to answer the question, \"does the inspection make a difference in the oberved number of errors?\"\n\nThe data set looks something like this:\n\n```\nID, errorsBefore, errorsAfter, size_large, size_medium, typeA, typeB, typeC, typeD\n0123,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0 \n2345,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0\n6789,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0\n1234,8,8,0,0,1,0,0,0\n\n```\n\nThere are roughly 4000 observations. The other variables are catagorical observations that descrie characteristics of the firms. Size can be small, medium, or large, and each firm is one and only one of those. Firms can be any or all of the \"types.\"\n\nI was asked to run some simple tests to see if there were statistically significant differences in observed error rates before and after the inspections for all firms and various sub\\-groupings (based on size and type). T\\-tests were out because the data was severely skewed both before and after, for example, in R the before data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore)\n# Min.  1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# 0.000  0.000    4.000  12.00    13.00  470.0\n\n```\n\n(These are made up \\-\\- I'm afraid I can't post the actual data or any actual manipulations of it due to proprietary/privacy issues \\-\\- my apologies!) \n\nThe paired differences were more centralized but still not very well fit by a normal distribution \\-\\- far too peaked. Differences data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore-errorsAfter)\n# Min.   1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# -110.0  -2.000   0.000  0.005   2.000   140.0\n\n```\n\nIt was suggested that I use a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and after a brief persusal of ?wilcox.test and Wikipedia, and here, this seems like the test to use. Considering the assumptions above, I believe (1\\) is fine given the data generating process. Assumption (2\\.a) is not strictly true for my data, but the discussion here: [Alternative to the Wilcoxon test when the distribution isn't continuous?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4834/alternative-to-the-wilcoxon-test-when-the-distribution-isnt-continuous) seemed to indicate that this wasn't too much of a concern. Assumption (3\\) is fine. My only concern (I believe) is Assumption (2\\.b).\n\n**One additional note**, some years later: I eventually took an excellent non\\-parametric stats course and spent a lot of time on the rank\\-sum tests. Embedded in assumption (2\\.a), \"Each Zi comes from the same continuous population\", is the idea that both samples mush come from populations with *equal variance* \\-\\- this turns out to be *extremely* important, practically speaking. If you have concerns about differing variance in your populations (from which you draw the samples), you should be concerned about using WMW.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Wikipedia has misled you in stating \"...if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a Wilcoxon signed rank test of the null that the distribution ... of x \\- y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed.\"\n\nThe test determines whether the RANK\\-TRANSFORMED values of $z\\_i \\= x\\_i \\- y\\_i$ are symmetric around the median you specify in your null hypothesis (I assume you'd use zero). Skewness is not a problem, since the signed\\-rank test, like most nonparametric tests, is \"distribution free.\" The price you pay for these tests is often reduced power, but it looks like you have a large enough sample to overcome that.\n\nA \"what the hell\" alternative to the rank\\-sum test might be to try a simple transformation like $\\\\ln(x\\_i)$ and $\\\\ln(y\\_i)$ on the off chance that these measurements might roughly follow a lognormal distribution\\-\\-so the logged values should look \"bell curvish\". Then you could use a t test and convince yourself (and your boss who only took Business Stats) that the rank\\-sum test is working. If this works, there's a bonus: the t test on means for lognormal data is a comparison of medians for the original, untransformed, measurements.\n\nMe? I'd do both, and anything else I could cook up (likelihood ratio test on Poisson counts by firm size?).

The counts are highly skewed, which violates the normality assumption of t-tests, even after log transformation (option A).\n3. While the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (option B) is distribution-free and could handle skewness, it doesn't account for the hierarchical structure of the data (employees nested within departments) or the count nature of the outcome.\n4. A mixed-effects Poisson regression can handle:\n   - The count nature of the data\n   - The skewness in the distribution\n   - The paired nature of the before-after measurements\n   - The hierarchical structure (departments as random effects)\n   - Potential overdispersion in the error counts\n\nOption A is suboptimal because log transformation may not fully address the skewness and doesn't account for the count nature of the data.

I could not find any resources which discuss/compare the merits of these two approaches.\n\nMy intuition is that with fewer observations it would be preferable to fit the absolute lower order moments which will be a more stable estimation (just a guess). In practice (in industry not academia) I have seen both methods used (usually the method that is easier to solve analytically...).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Partial answer \\-\\-\\- for the reader to complete.*\n\nWe can simplify the question a bit by considering the relationship between the moments. Consider a random variable $X$ and $m\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(X^r)$ denote the $r$th raw moment and let $a\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(\\|X\\|^r)$ denote the $r$th absolute moment. For simplicity, we will assume that all the required moments exist. For a distribution that is symmetric around zero, we have:\n\n$$\\\\begin{matrix}\nm\\_r \\= 0 \\\\ \\\\ \\& \\& \\& \\\\text{for odd } k, \\\\ \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\nm\\_r \\= a\\_r \\& \\& \\& \\\\text{for even } k. \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{matrix}$$\n\nSo, essentially, the question becomes, should we fit using the lowest order absolute moments or only every second absolute moment (i.e., those with even order). The lower absolute moments are usually going to be more robust, and may have lower variance, but estimators on the lower order absolute moments are also often biased. There may be a trade\\-off between bias and variance in such cases, and you will need to derive the bias and variance of your estimators in the case under consideration to be sure.\n\nUltimately, the relative merits of two competing estimators is assessed by their statistical properties (e.g., bias, variance, MSE, consistency, other asymptotic properties). Usually this process entails looking at the moments of the estimator (or even its full distribution in some cases) in a class of problems under consideration and seeing how the estimator performs at different sample sizes under different parametric inputs. I am not aware of any specific literature comparing the two estimators here (though there may well be some), but it is possible to make a comparison using ordinary techniques for the assessment of estimators.\n\n---\n\n**Example:** Consider data $X\\_1,...,X\\_n \\\\sim \\\\text{N}(0, \\\\sigma^2\\)$ from a normal distribution with zero mean.

The rest of the code hooks this into APA's sectioning commands (it's tedious but it does the trick). \n\nNote that although this should get you going, it isn't completely ready for prime time, mainly because the work will take some time which, if it weren't something you wanted to proceed with, would divert me from things I'm actually supposed to be doing `:)`. Nevertheless, if this were something you wanted to proceed with, you'll need to let `stringstrings` know that '\\-' (as in 'Knock\\-on') should be treated the same way as a space character (run the code below to see what I mean).

Which of the following approaches would be most effective and efficient for achieving this goal while maintaining flexibility and adhering to LaTeX best practices?\n\nA) Manually redefine each sectioning command to apply \\MakeUppercase to the first letter of every word\nB) Use the stringstrings package with a custom \\MakeTitlecase command that incorporates \\addlcwords for exceptions\nC) Create a new environment that wraps all section headings and applies a regex-based title case function\nD) Modify the underlying LaTeX kernel to automatically apply title case to all sectioning commands globally\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is option B, which uses the stringstrings package with a custom \\MakeTitlecase command and \\addlcwords for exceptions. This solution is superior because:\n\n1. It leverages existing LaTeX packages (stringstrings) rather than reinventing the wheel, which is a best practice in LaTeX development.\n2. It allows for flexibility by using \\addlcwords to specify which words should remain in lowercase, adhering to proper title case rules.\n3. The custom \\MakeTitlecase command can be easily integrated into existing sectioning commands, as demonstrated in the provided code snippet.\n4. This approach maintains separation of concerns by keeping the formatting logic separate from the structural sectioning commands.\n5. It's more maintainable and less error-prone than manually redefining each sectioning command (option A).\n6. Unlike option C, it doesn't require creating a new environment, which could potentially conflict with other packages or customizations.\n7. It's far less invasive and risky than modifying the LaTeX kernel (option D), which could lead to compatibility issues and is generally not recommended.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of LaTeX packages, command definitions, and string manipulation.

After attempting several standard remediation steps, they discover a typo in the /var/lib/dpkg/status file, where a package architecture is incorrectly listed as \"k386\" instead of \"i386\". What is the most likely root cause of this issue, and what broader implications does it have for system maintenance?\n\nA) A manual edit of the status file introduced the typo, highlighting the risks of direct manipulation of package management databases\nB) A hardware-specific package was incorrectly installed, suggesting potential compatibility issues with the system architecture\nC) A corrupted package cache led to the typo, indicating a need for a complete system package audit and potential reinstallation\nD) A malicious script altered the status file, pointing to a potential security breach that requires immediate investigation\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The root cause is most likely a manual edit of the /var/lib/dpkg/status file that introduced the \"k386\" typo. This scenario highlights several important concepts in system administration and package management:\n\n1. The sensitivity of package management databases: Direct editing of files like /var/lib/dpkg/status can have far-reaching consequences, as these files are critical for the proper functioning of the package management system.\n\n2. The interconnectedness of package management: A single typo in a package's architecture can prevent proper configuration and upgrades, as seen in the error messages where libtiff4:i386 couldn't be configured due to the mismatch with libtiff4:k386.\n\n3. Troubleshooting methodology: The problem wasn't immediately apparent from standard package management commands, requiring deeper investigation into system files.\n\n4. The importance of version consistency: The error messages highlight how package versions need to be consistent across architectures for proper system operation.\n\n5. The potential for cascading errors: What seemed like a simple typo led to multiple failed package management operations, illustrating how a small issue can have wide-ranging effects.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from package management, system administration, and troubleshooting methodologies.

It emphasizes the idea of traits or characteristics being transferred from one generation to the next, which is how class inheritance works in OOP. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it represents the misconception that inheritance in OOP is like bequeathing property, which the documentation specifically refutes. Options C and D are distractors that represent different types of relationships that don't accurately capture the nature of inheritance in programming.\n\nThis question requires the student to analyze the given analogy in the context of OOP, apply it to real-world examples, and critically evaluate which option best represents the concept.

Given the error logs and debugging attempts described, what is the most likely root cause of the persistent \"Start tag expected, '<' not found\" error?\n\nA) Malformed XML syntax in the cmsmart.xml layout file\nB) Corrupted binary data being parsed as XML inadvertently\nC) Incorrect character encoding in XML files\nD) Race condition in parallel XML parsing processes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires analysis of multiple pieces of information from the documentation and application of XML parsing concepts. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The initial error logs show simplexml_load_string() failing, indicating the issue is with the content being parsed, not necessarily the XML files themselves.\n\n2. The developer's attempt to log the problematic string reveals non-printable characters: \"\u00b0#  .   \u00bd; \u00f4..\" This strongly suggests binary or corrupted data is being mistakenly treated as XML.\n\n3. When the developer changed the error logging, they got more specific LibXMLError objects. These consistently show \"Start tag expected, '<' not found\" at column 1, line 1 of the input, further supporting the idea that non-XML data is being parsed.\n\n4. The cmsmart.xml file contents shown appear to be well-formed XML, ruling out option A.\n\n5.

Given the provided code snippet and error message, what is the most likely cause of this issue and the best approach to resolve it?\n\nA) The `user` variable is undefined because the member is not in the cache. Implement a fetch operation before adding the role.\nB) The `arguments` array is empty due to incorrect string splitting. Use `split(' ')` instead of `split('')`.\nC) The `userId` extraction is incorrect. Use a regular expression to extract the user ID from a mention.\nD) The `role` variable is undefined because the role name 'ROLE' doesn't exist. Implement error handling for role lookup.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The error message indicates that the `user` object is undefined when trying to access its `roles` property. This is most likely because the member is not in the cache, which can happen if the bot hasn't seen the user recently or if the server has a large number of members. \n\nTo resolve this, the developer should implement a fetch operation to ensure the member data is available before attempting to add the role. Here's an improved version of the code:\n\n```javascript\nif (command === 'addrole') {\n    const role = message.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === 'ROLE')\n    const userId = arguments[0].replace(/[<@!>]/g, ''); // Extract ID from mention\n    message.guild.members.fetch(userId)\n        .then(user => {\n            if (user && role) {\n                user.roles.add(role)\n                    .then(() => message.channel.send('Role added successfully'))\n                    .catch(error => message.channel.send(`Error adding role: ${error}`));\n            } else {\n                message.channel.send('User or role not found');\n            }\n        })\n        .catch(error => message.channel.send(`Error fetching user: ${error}`));\n}\n```\n\nThis solution addresses multiple issues:\n1. It fetches the member data to ensure it's available.\n2. It improves the user ID extraction to work with different mention formats.\n3. It adds error handling for both user fetching and role adding.\n4.

The substitution y = \u221a(x+1) is indeed the right first step, transforming the limit as x \u2192 0 to y \u2192 1.\n\n2. After substitution, the numerator becomes sin(2\u03c0\u00b7y) and the denominator becomes y\u00b2-1, similar to the documentation example.\n\n3. The key insight is to rewrite the sine argument as 2\u03c0\u00b7y = 2\u03c0(y-1) + 2\u03c0. This step is crucial because it allows us to use the limit property of sine when its argument approaches zero.\n\n4. The final steps involve recognizing the limit of (sin u)/u as u approaches 0, which equals 1, and simplifying the remaining terms.\n\n5. Unlike the original problem, this limit will not result in -\u03c0/2, but rather 2\u03c0 due to the factor of 2 in the sine argument.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to adapt the given method to a slightly different problem, recognizing the importance of manipulating the trigonometric argument and understanding the fundamental limits of trigonometric functions.

The correct answer, A, addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It eliminates the need for manual memory management (delete in the destructor), which aligns with the recommendation to avoid raw pointers when better alternatives exist.\n\n2. Using std::unique_ptr maintains the ability to have a nullable socket (initially nullptr) and check for its existence before use, preserving the original logic.\n\n3. std::make_unique in initializeConnection allows for exception safety during object creation, addressing the concern about handling exceptions at the point of connection rather than at program start.\n\n4.

This scenario precisely matches the situation described in the documentation where emails have a valid DKIM signature but fail SPF checks.\n\nThe best solution is to implement DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) with a relaxed alignment policy. DMARC allows domain owners to specify how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks. By implementing DMARC with a relaxed policy, the company can:\n\n1.

This option ensures that the simulator displays the exact pixel dimensions of the device being simulated, without any scaling artifacts.\n\nOption A (using Terminal to set scale) and Option B (manually resizing) may introduce inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the display. Option D refers to an outdated version of Xcode and doesn't provide pixel-accurate representation.\n\nThe \"Pixel Accurate\" setting (Command + 2 in Xcode 9.1) addresses the core issue of screenshot fidelity by ensuring that each pixel in the simulator corresponds exactly to a pixel on the simulated device.

How does it affect the Gamma function's applicability in other areas of mathematics?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, let me mention that log convexity of a function is implied by an analytic property, which appears to be more natural than log convexity itself. Namely, if $\\\\mu$ is a Borel measure on $\\[0,\\\\infty)$ such that the $r$th moment \n$$f(r)\\=\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}z^r d\\\\mu(z)$$\nis finite for all $r$ in the interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$, then $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$.\n\nLog convexity can be effectively used in derivation of various inequalities involving the gamma function (particularly, two\\-sided estimates of products of gamma functions). It is linked with the notion of [Schur convexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorization) which is itself used in many applications.\n\n**An appetizer.** Let $m\\=\\\\max x\\_i$, $s\\=\\\\sum x\\_i$, $x\\_i \\> 0$, $i \\= 1,\\\\dots,n$, then\n$$\\[\\\\Gamma(s/n)]^n\\\\leq\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{1}^{n}\\\\Gamma (x\\_i)\\\\leq \\\\left\\[\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{s\\-m}{n\\-1}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{n\\-1}\\\\Gamma(m).\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1\\)$$\n\n(1\\) is trivial, of course, when all $x\\_i$ and $s/n$ are integers, but in general the bounds do not hold without assuming log convexity.\n\n**Edit added: a sketch of the proof**. Let $f$ be a continuous positive function defined on an interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$. One may show that the function $\\\\phi(x)\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^{n}f(x\\_i)$, $x\\\\in I^n$ is Schur\\-convex on $I^n$ if and only if $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$.

The correct answer is B because the documentation specifically mentions that the \"offending file\" causing the unexpected behavior was ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.lst.

Option C is an extreme measure that likely wouldn't solve the issue, as the problem lies in configuration files, not the applications themselves. Option D is a plausible distractor, as it involves creating application shortcuts, but it doesn't directly address the file association problem.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a problem, identify relevant information from documentation, and apply that knowledge to a specific system configuration issue.

While the inspector didn't find anything broken, he said it was nearing its end of days, and that it was only a matter of time until something broke. As per his recommendation, my apartment complex replaced the unit.**\n\nI live in an apartment unit that's 34 years old, and I'm a little concerned about the state of my furnace and AC unit. I don't know exactly when it unit was installed, but it seems to be showing its age. I noticed an excessive amount of rust flakes and, now that the gas heater is flexing its muscles for the cold this season, some ash. I honestly don't know much about HVAC systems in general, so I took some pictures. Is the condition of my system any cause for concern?\n\n[![Rusty ledge](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)\n\nThis is where most of the rust would pile up. I have cleaned most of it off. Before I did, it would simply drop to the ledge and floor below.\n\n[![Gas burners](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxgHR.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxgHR.jpg)\n\nThis is underneath the rusty ledge, looking at the burners.

The ash was not present before this season when the heat kicked in.\n\n[![Left hole](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTcgu.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTcgu.jpg)\n\nUnderneath the rusty \"hood\" in the first image, there are two holes where it seemed most of the rust would fall from. It was a little difficult to get a good picture of these holes, so please excuse the poor camera work on my part. This is the left one. I'm not sure what the larger bits once were, but they don't look or feel like metal or rust. My guess is that at some point this hole was partially covered by some material that fell apart through the years.\n\n[![Right hole](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HznPk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HznPk.jpg)\n\nThe right hole didn't have the same non\\-metallic flaky bits, but did show a good amount of rust flakes sitting inside. I'm not entirely sure what these holes are for, but again, I'm not very familiar with these systems. It seems like a majority of the rust comes from these holes and drops onto the rusty \"hood\" (first picture). I lightly brushed my finger along the outer rim of the hole and rust eagerly fell out.\n\n[![Floor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZHwy.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZHwy.jpg)\n\nThis last picture is of the floor below the unit. You can see a small section where I dragged my finger through the rust that had piled up. I doubt this picture is very relevant, but I included it to give a scope of how messy this system is.\n\nI know this is a long post, so thank you for reading it through. My question is, should I be concerned about the excessive amount of rust accumulating through this system? As far as I'm aware, the furnace and AC work alright apart from being noisy and inefficient. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would talk to your landlord to ask them to inspect your furnace/AC for the year and let them make the determination.\n\nWhen I do something like this with my landlord, I remind them that making sure things are right will save them from a catastrophe, possibly in the near future. And yes, I do say it something similar to that. I hold back only enough to let them feel as if the decision is theirs. I also make valid statements about things should work, vs how it currently is working, even if I have to research that info first (like you are doing).\n\nIf your landlord is honest, and not a slumlord, you have a good chance to get at least some work done to it, if not replaced. Most furnaces are designed to last around 20 years, so it's a good chance it's been replaced sometime in those 34 years since the building was built. It may simply need a good cleaning and some basic maintenance.\n\nFurnaces usually smell of burnt rust and dust when they first come on for the season. If that odor continues past the first week of steady use, then it's not normal, in my experience.\n\nAgain, letting your landlord make the decision will make you sound like less of a jerk tenant (or worse) and more of a concerned person who knows what you/they're talking about. Just because you got your information of the Interwebs doesn't have to mean anything to them. ;\\-)\n\nSimply making them away of a situation before it becomes a problem will, eventually and hopefully, will get you on their good side.

If 10k\\+ userA can flag 100 comments in a day, then allow 10k\\+ reviewerB to have up to 100 concurring flags to support what userA flagged.\n* I don't know if a \"disagree\" response is really required at this point for comment flagging. It seems like extra, unnecessary overhead when the point is to help clear out the ephemeral aspects of the sites. Just let the reviewer skip that particular comment and move on to the next in the queue.\n* Likewise, I don't think we need the gamification aspects like we have with the main review queues. We don't need badges (*gasp!*); we don't need public rankings; we don't need public history of comment flag reviews.

This is known as an [irrational rotation of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_rotation), and for our choice of $\\\\theta$ ($\\\\theta$ and $2\\\\pi$ are rationally inconsummerate, i.e. $\\\\theta / \\\\pi \\\\not \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$) it has no periodic or fixed points."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying a discrete dynamical system described by the equations:\n\nr\u0304 = 1 + \u03b1(r - 1)\n\u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6 + \u03b8 \u00b7 (1+r\u00b2)/2 mod 2\u03c0\n\nWhere 0 < \u03b1 < 1, r \u2208 \u211d, \u03c6 \u2208 S\u00b9, and \u03b8/\u03c0 \u2209 \u211a.

Here's why:\n\n1. The r-dynamics are independent of \u03c6 and converge to r = 1 for any initial condition (0 < \u03b1 < 1 ensures this).\n\n2. When r = 1, the \u03c6-dynamics become \u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6 + \u03b8 mod 2\u03c0, which is an irrational rotation of the circle (because \u03b8/\u03c0 \u2209 \u211a).\n\n3. This attractor is neither a fixed point nor a periodic orbit. It's attracting because nearby points converge to r = 1, but on the attractor itself, the motion is quasi-periodic due to the irrational rotation.\n\n4. This example demonstrates a non-trivial attractor that doesn't fit the usual categories of fixed points or periodic orbits.\n\n5. It's stable and attracting in the r-direction but neither stable nor unstable in the \u03c6-direction (due to the irrational rotation preserving distances on the circle).\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (attractors, stability, quasi-periodicity), applies them to a real dynamical system, and tests critical thinking about the nature of attractors beyond the typical fixed points and periodic orbits."}, "60": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/06/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/231711", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/33000/"], "docs_id": 231711, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Magento has released **Magento\\-2\\.2\\.5** version on **June 27, 2018**\n\nThis release includes :\n\n**1**.

The input is read, parsed, and the contents are stored on a structure for later use.\n\nNow, in general you want to keep into account transformation of the data from the input, such as adding default values when not specified, or adding full path information to relative path specified in the input. There are two different strategies to achieve this.\n\nThe first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time. In practice, you put all the intelligence into the input parser, and your application has no logic to deal with unexpected circumstances, such as an unspecified value. You lose the information of what was specified and what wasn't, but you gain in black\\-boxing the details. Your \"running code\" needs that information in any case and in a proper form, and is not concerned if it's the default or a user\\-specified information.\n\nThe second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior. unspecified values are not filled (which may however be a problem in languages not supporting None) and data is stored verbatim from the file. The intelligence for recovery must now go into the \"running code\", which must check what was specified in the file, eventually fall back to a default, or modify the input properly before using it. \n\nI would like to know your opinion on these two approaches, and in particular which one you found the most frequently implemented. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is, of course, a false dichotomy. The real answer is not this simple.\n\nAlso the presence or absence of `None` or `Null` isn't interesting (or even relevant).\n\n> The first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time.\n\nIn the long run, this becomes a maintenance nightmare. \"black\\-boxing the details\" is a bad policy.\n\n> The second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior.\n\nThat's a very weird way to put it, but that's one small part of a good architecture.\n\n**None**. `None` or `Null` is what you can call a *domain independent null* \\-\\- a universal nothing value. Some languages (like C) lack a domain independent null. That doesn't mean anything, because you have at least two ways forward.\n\n1. Domain\\-specific null. Input values like zero\\-length fields, or `999-99-9999` for a Social Security Number and stuff like that are domain\\-specific null values. You may have this kind of thing.\n2. Flags. The embedded SQL folks decided that the best way to handle SQL NULL in languages which don't have a domain\\-independent NULL is to provide an array of flags as null indicators. Applications in C (or COBOL or even FORTRAN) would have to check the null indicator for the presence of a SQL NULL. The actual field could have any random junk in it if the indicator said it was really a NULL.\n\n**Transformation**. For information on this, read up on ETL (Extract Transform Load) processing.\n\nApplications that process files naturally form a pipeline.\n\n1. Input reading. This byte\\-to\\-character processing. The least you can do to read. If you have Unicode decoders, they go here. Nothing more.\n2. Some kind of lexical scanning \\-\\- the basis for syntax recognition. If it's a CSV file, this is the comma or tab recognition.\n3. Some kind of file object parsing. This creates Domain Objects based on the file representation. For CSV or tab\\-delimited files, it creates a list of row values. \n\nFor XML files, 1, 2 and 3 are combined into an XML parser.\n4. Some kind of application object parsing. For CSV files, this is where you'd transform a sequence of objects into something more usable by your application. \n\nFor JSON, YAML or files, this creates the objects. Often, 2, 3 and 4 are all done by the load operation.\n\nAt this point you have an object in your application domain. Processing from this point forward is independent of the initial input format. In the applications I support, all of the previous processing is a separate library that handles XLS, XLSX, CSV and a few other formats for the inputs.\n\nOnce you have a application domain object, you then have to apply your application's rules. This varies a lot, of course. But here's the strategy.\n\n1. Write down the \"outer\" processing loop. `for object in source(): process( object )`. Maybe it involves decision making. `for object in source(): if valid( object): process( object )`. Whatever the high\\-level, end\\-user, easy\\-to\\-understand summary is.\n2. Odds are good that none of the input objects are actually suitable for this kind of processing. You have things like cleansing, filtering, validation, derived data calculation, foreign\\-key reference lookups and the final stage of persistence (update/insert/delete) processing. This forms a natural pipeline. \n\nDefine this pipeline from \"back to the front\". \n\nWhat must be true of the objects so they can fit with your ideal outer loop? \n\nWrite down all the conditions that must be true. (cleaned this way and that way, filtered for this that and the other, calculations done for this and that, etc., etc.)\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for the persistence step?\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for that?\n\netc. \n\nUntil you've run out of \"last thing to be done to prepare\" and you're looking at the input objects and a pipeline of steps to prepare them for their final persistence.\n3. For each stage in the pipeline, design the simplest transformation function you can get away with to do just that operation on each input object, cleaning, filtering, validating, deriving data, doing lookups and finally doing whatever persistence thing must be done.\n\nEach of these stages will have to make use of the null indicators, BTW. \n\nSome of these will be generic and reusable. Some won't be. Don't think about reuse. Discover reuse after you've written the same code 3 or more times.\n\n**Object Updates**. There are at least two ways to handle the transformations.\n\n1. Update the objects as you go. This is classic \"OO\" design. Stateful objects.\n2. Create new objects from old objects. This is more of the functional programming design. Immutable objects. In some languages, this requires more memory management. On the other hand, if each object is immutable, the pipeline becomes simpler because each stage expects a specific data type and creates an object of a different specific data type."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software team is developing a new application that processes complex configuration files.

The developer should split the content into multiple, shorter answers across different questions.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The scenario describes a situation where the developer's post was flagged as looking like a promotional piece (spam). The top answer indicates that when four out of five of the developer's answers mentioned a specific product, and two were exact duplicates linking to another answer, it appeared suspicious. This aligns with option A, which correctly identifies the spam flag as the reason for deletion.\n\nThe best course of action is not to abandon Stack Overflow (as suggested in B), which would be an overreaction. There's no indication of copyright issues (C) or the answer being too detailed (D). Instead, the developer should revise their approach to focus more on general comparisons and less on specific product promotion, as advised in the guidelines mentioned by Robert Harvey.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given scenario, application of Stack Overflow's community guidelines, and critical thinking about appropriate online behavior in technical communities.

I think it's been solved now, all thanks to hours of googling, testing and stubbornness.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, I've fixed the read only filesystem problem by upgrading my Kernel to 3\\.8\\.2 but then it caused problems with my wifi drivers (Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802\\.11b/g LP\\-PHY \\[14e4:4315] (rev 01\\)). I could not get the wifi working as it seemed to be the problem with the wl module.\n\nNevertheless, I've found this article ([http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless\\-bcm4312\\-with\\-the\\-3\\-4\\-and\\-3\\-5\\-kernel/](http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless-bcm4312-with-the-3-4-and-3-5-kernel/)), which helped me fix the wifi problem. So I've decided to give kernel 3\\.8\\.2 one more try with the wifi fix and it worked.\n\nTo summarise:\nIf you have read only filesystem issues and nothing is working, check what version of kernel you are running `uname -a`. If its below 3\\.8\\.2 then upgrade to it by following these steps:\n\nThe simplest set of instructions I always used for kernel upgrade / downgrade are by ubuntuforums.org user by the name of lykwydchykyn (url modified by me for this post):\n\n> ```\n> Go here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n> \n> Download 3 (maybe 4) debs to a folder somewhere:\n> \n> linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_all.deb\n> linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n> linux-image-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n> linux-image-extra-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb   # if available\n> \n> Install the debs with whatever package manager front-end you use (is gdebi still around?), or use these commands:\n> \n> cd /path/to/folder/where/you/put/the/debs\n> sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n> \n> ```\n> \n> Source: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p\\=11391743\\#post11391743](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11391743#post11391743)\n\nIf you have wifi problems after upgrading the kernel. Then try these steps:\n\n> ```\n> Download the 32 or 64-bit version:\n> http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php\n> Download my patches: bc_wl_abiupdate.patch and switch_to.patch\n> Extract the sources:\n> cd ~/Downloads; mkdir -p wl; cd wl; tar xf ../hybrid-portsrc*.tar.gz\n> Patch and compile the sources:\n> patch -p0 src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c < ~/Downloads/switch_to.patch; patch -p0 src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c < ~/Downloads/bc_wl_abiupdate.patch;\n> make; sudo make install; sudo depmod; sudo modprobe wl \n> \n> ```\n> \n> Give Ubuntu a few seconds after loading the \u201cwl\u201d kernel module, then\n>  eventually the Network Manager will start looking for wireless\n>  networks.\n\nThat's it, should work.\n\nGood luck to all of you."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting recurring filesystem errors on a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop with an SSD. Given the following information from the user's report, what is the most likely root cause of the persistent filesystem issues?\n\nA) Kernel incompatibility with the ext4 filesystem\nB) Incorrect mount options in the fstab file\nC) Failing SSD hardware\nD) Improper shutdown procedures\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario presents multiple indicators pointing towards failing SSD hardware:\n\n1. Random system problems forcing restarts, despite clean S.M.A.R.T. reports and reinstallation of the OS, suggest an underlying hardware issue.\n\n2. The dmesg log contains critical error messages indicative of storage device failures:\n   - \"EXT4-fs warning: Filesystem error recorded from previous mount: IO failure\"\n   - \"ata1.00 error: { UNC }\"\n   - \"Sense Key : Medium Error [current] [descriptor]\"\n   - \"Add. Sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed\"\n\n3. The error \"end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 123562216\" specifically points to a disk sector that couldn't be read, which is a common sign of SSD failure.\n\n4. The issues persist across OS reinstallations and filesystem checks, ruling out software-related causes.\n\nWhile option A (kernel incompatibility) might seem plausible due to the mention of ext4 issues in the user's research, the persistent nature of the problem across reinstallations makes this less likely. Option B (incorrect mount options) is unlikely to cause such severe and random issues. Option D (improper shutdown) wouldn't typically result in the specific hardware errors observed in the dmesg log.\n\nThis question requires the test-taker to analyze multiple pieces of information, apply troubleshooting knowledge, and critically evaluate the most probable cause among plausible options, aligning with the L3+ cognitive level requirement."}, "66": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/10", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/49789", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/7596/"], "docs_id": 49789, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to consider a couple of examples of systems which have energies that are intensive variables \\- not extensive. I'be been thinking about this and I am not coming up with anything. My understanding is that extensive variables (at least wrt usual energies) scales with mass or length (system size). It also seems that some 'energies' depend upon the model used, such as how strong the interactions are in neighbors of atoms or dipoles, etc., or whether one is considering chemical potential or not, etc.\n\nAny good suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, that is entirely true. All this \"junk\" is usually separated in two categories: *space debris* (man\\-made), and *micro\\-meteoroids* (natural origins). \n\nMicro\\-meteoroids\n-----------------\n\nMicro\\-meteoroids are not as common as you might think. Even when you fly straight through the asteroid belt, micrometeorite impacts will be extremely unlikely. This is because small objects (dust, comet debris,\u00a0...) get pushed out of the Solar system by solar radiation pressure, are very likely to fall on a nearby asteroid, be caught in some planet's gravity field (Jupiter, mostly), etc. In short, small celestial bodies (in the order of cm or less) generally have a very short life span on astronomical time scales. \n\nThey *can* however be a problem near Jupiter for instance, which, because of its large mass, is a gravitational sink for these small objects. Even though they won't live there for very long, there are just so many of them flowing into Jupiter's gravity well all the time that they might just pose a problem. They haven't caused any major problems in exploration missions yet, but nevertheless, the [Galileo spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_%28spacecraft%29) and most others flying to or past Jupiter were equipped with micro\\-meteoroid impact protection systems around the most critical components. \n\nSpace debris\n------------\n\nSpace debris is a very active field of study. As it is man\\-made, it is only a problem of any size for spacecraft *near the Earth*. The importance of most near\\-Earth satellites and the threat space debris poses to them is why [NORAD keeps track of most space debris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#NORAD.2C_Gabbard_and_Kessler) in the vicinity of Earth. Information gathered by NORAD is used by space mission designers, so that they can design a spacecraft's trajectory such that it avoids collisions with larger (\\>\\~10cm) chunks of space debris. \n\nAlthough this prevents most catastrophic collisions, it is very difficult if not impossible to track all the smaller objects (\\<\\~10cm). There are unfortunately many millions of such things close to the Eartch, which sometimes indeed leads to impact. Solar panels from the ISS returned to Earth are riddled with holes, dents, scratches, etc., all resulting from impacts with space debris. The ISS has a lot of shields all over able to withstand impact with objects smaller than a few mm. For instance, the windows of the ISS are not simply a few layers of glass; there's pressure panes, primary shield, secondary shield, scratch panes, etc. Teh overall thickness of a window can exceed 40cm. The shield in front of a window is designed to be strong enough to break any impacting particle up into lower\\-mass dust, which then sprays out over the deliberate spacing between the primary shield and auxiliary pressure pane, the latter of which is then able to withstand the lower energy impact of the dust. It's kind of like bullet\\-proof glass, but then for bullets travelling several km/s :) \n\nSpace debris is not *really* a problem yet, because even though there is a large number of objects orbiting the Earth, the volume they fly through is so vast that the average density is still very low. But, when things like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#China) happen, there is a *major* impact on many space missions, existing and future ones. When not taken seriously between now and \\~15 years, space debris might indeed become a real threat, possibly even leading to the [Kessler syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about space debris and micro-meteoroids, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A space agency is planning a long-term mission to Jupiter's orbit.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The mission is to Jupiter's orbit, not near-Earth orbit. This eliminates options A and C, which are more relevant to Earth-orbiting missions.\n\n2.

It's kind of easy to miss, so I've at times set it off when I was trying to activate it. If you're playing on single player, you might be able to go by the powers that are active on the power wheel.

The simpler ones have a fully diff output, i.e. the output is not referenced to ground but is the difference between two terminals. You build the usual non inverting amp with the inputs and the positive output, and feed \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V to the negative output. This *might* work but not all op amps like an output to be set to a specific voltage.\n\nIf you can use an instrumentation amplifier that would be much better. It is not an opamp but it is a single component. INAMPS need no external feedback, that's built in, and they usually have some very precise preset gain, or you can set it eithger with a control voltage or digitally. The output usually have a reference terminal: that is where you want to hook your \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V, and that terminal is though exactly for this purpose.\n\nTo vary the offset you can set the ref voltage with a potentiometer, maybe add some safety resistors in order to not let the ref terminal swing the full \\\\$\\\\pm 15\\\\$V: the inamp might not like it as well as your subsequent circuit.\n\nAs hinted in the comments, if your supplies are not well regulated using a mere divider to get the \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V won't work: you will need a linear regulator and a divider after that.\n\nIf you absolutely need to do that with a single ended, single op amp there is a circuit:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4Icl.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fU4Icl.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nSome analysis leads to:\n$$\nV\\_{out} \\= \\\\left(1\\+\\\\frac{R\\_2}{R\\_1}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{R\\_3\\+R\\_4}\\\\left(V\\_sR\\_4\\+ER\\_3\\\\right) \n$$\nthat is in the form \\\\$V\\_{out}\\=\\\\alpha V\\_s \\+ \\\\beta E\\\\$ with \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\beta\\\\$ positive. \n\nJust work out some values for the resistors if you want to build this last circuit, but the INAMP solution is the best you can get.\n\n**pros and cons** of each solution:\n\n**INAMP** pros: it's designed to do what you want, your only concern is the offset voltage but that is a concern for every solution. cons: costs and power consumption.\n\n**FULLY DIFF AMP** pros: it's easy and cheap to set up, costs and power are just like a single ended opamp. cons: it probably won't work since you try to set one of the output rails to a fixed voltage\n\n**SINGLE OPAMP** pros: dirty cheap and easy, fits the spec. cons: do you see that ton of resistors? they are bad. they are not precise, they need space, they are bad creatures.

The Poisson distribution, used for modeling count data, is inappropriate since the variance is much larger than the mean.

Thus my question is: what is known about special holonomy manifolds for metrics of general signature? (I am most interested in the (1,n) case!) In particular I would like to know if there is a classification of allowed holonomy groups and further if there are interesting examples that I should be aware of.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it would be more accurate to say that the real reason why\nCalabi\\-Yau, hyperk\u00e4hler, $G\\_2$ and $\\\\mathrm{Spin}(7\\)$ manifolds are of\ninterest in string theory is not their Ricci\\-flatness, but the fact\nthat they admit parallel spinor fields. Of course, in\npositive\\-definite signature, existence of parallel spinor fields\nimplies Ricci\\-flatness, but the converse is still open for compact\nriemannian manifolds, as discussed in [this\nquestion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16818/are-there-ricci-flat-riemannian-manifolds-with-generic-holonomy), and known to fail for noncompact manifolds as pointed\nout in an answer to that question.\n\nThe similar question for lorentzian manifolds has a bit of history.\nFirst of all, the holonomy principle states that a spin manifold\nadmits parallel spinor fields if and only if (the spin lift of) its\nholonomy group is contained in the stabilizer subgroup of a nonzero\nspinor. Some low\\-dimensional (i.e., $\\\\leq 11$, the cases relevant to\nstring and M\\-theories) investigations (by [Robert Bryant](http://arXiv.org/abs/math.DG/0004073) and [myself](http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/9904124),\nindependently) suggested that these subgroups are either of two types:\nsubgroups $G \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n) \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(1,n)$, whence $G$ is\nthe ones corresponding to the cases 5\\-8 in the question, or else $G \\=\nH \\\\ltimes \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\-1}$, where $H \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n\\-1\\)$ is one of\nthe groups in cases 5\\-8 in the question. Thomas Leistner showed that\nthis persisted in the general case and, as Igor pointed out in his\nanswer, arrived at a classification of possible lorentzian holonomy\ngroups. Anton Galaev then constructed metrics with all the possible\nholonomy groups, showing that they all arise. Their work is reviewed\nin [their\npaper](http://dx.doi.org/10.4171/051-1/2) ([MR2436228](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2436228)).\n\nThe basic difficulty in the indefinite\\-signature case is that the de\nRham decomposition theorem is modified. Recall that the de Rham\ndecomposition theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a complete, connected\nand simply connected positive\\-definite riemannian manifold and if the\nholonomy group acts reducibly, then the manifold is a riemannian\nproduct, whence it is enough to restrict to irreducible holonomy\nrepresentations. This is by no means a trivial problem, but is\ntractable.\n\nIn contrast, in the indefinite signature situation, there is a\nmodification of this theorem due to Wu, which says that it is not\nenough for the holonomy representation to be reducible, it has to be\n*nondegenerately* reducible. This means that it is fully reducible\nand the direct sums in the decomposition are orthogonal with respect\nto the metric. This means that it is therefore not enough to restrict\noneself to irreducible holonomy representations.

It is now not enough to\nreduce the holonomy to the isotropy of a spinor, but the\nRicci\\-flatness equation must be imposed additionally."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A theoretical physicist is developing a model for a higher-dimensional supersymmetric theory. They are considering a 10-dimensional spacetime with a 4-dimensional Lorentzian component and a 6-dimensional compact component. Which of the following statements about the holonomy of this space is most accurate and relevant for string theory applications?\n\nA) The compact component must have SU(3) holonomy to preserve supersymmetry, while the Lorentzian component will always have SO(1,3) holonomy.\n\nB) The holonomy group of the full 10-dimensional spacetime must be a subgroup of Spin(1,9) that leaves a spinor invariant.\n\nC) The compact component should have G2 holonomy to ensure Ricci-flatness, which is necessary for all string theory models.\n\nD) The Lorentzian component must have a holonomy group of the form H \u22c9 R^3, where H is a subgroup of SU(2), to admit parallel spinor fields.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts and application to a real-world scenario in theoretical physics. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. In string theory, preserving supersymmetry is crucial, which requires the existence of parallel spinor fields on the entire 10-dimensional spacetime.\n\n2. The holonomy principle states that a spin manifold admits parallel spinor fields if and only if the spin lift of its holonomy group is contained in the stabilizer subgroup of a nonzero spinor.\n\n3. For a 10-dimensional spacetime with Lorentzian signature, the full holonomy group must be a subgroup of Spin(1,9), which is the double cover of SO(1,9).\n\n4. The requirement for the holonomy group to leave a spinor invariant ensures the existence of parallel spinors, which is necessary for supersymmetry.\n\nOption A is partially correct but oversimplified. While SU(3) holonomy for the compact component (corresponding to a Calabi-Yau manifold) is common in string theory, it's not the only possibility. Moreover, the Lorentzian component's holonomy can be more complex than just SO(1,3).\n\nOption C is incorrect because G2 holonomy applies to 7-dimensional manifolds, not 6-dimensional ones. Additionally, while Ricci-flatness is important, it's not sufficient to ensure the existence of parallel spinors in Lorentzian signature.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it inappropriately applies the structure H \u22c9 R^(n-1) (which is relevant for Lorentzian manifolds admitting parallel spinors) to the 4-dimensional Lorentzian component only, rather than considering the full 10-dimensional spacetime.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of holonomy groups in both Riemannian and Lorentzian settings, their relevance to parallel spinors and supersymmetry, and the application of these concepts to string theory scenarios."}, "76": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/263054", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/23935/"], "docs_id": 263054, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a general (integral) solution to $du(t)\\= \\-a(t)u(t)\\\\,dt \\+\\\\sigma(t)\\\\,dz$?

This term allows for non-linear, unpredictable fluctuations in the asset's value.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the -a(t)u(t)dt term suggests a decreasing trend, the stochastic term can counteract this, potentially leading to increases.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the volatility \u03c3(t) directly affects the magnitude of the stochastic integral, significantly impacting the asset's behavior.\n\nOption C is partially correct but oversimplifies the model. The path is not purely deterministic with superimposed fluctuations; instead, the stochastic integral is an integral part of the solution, allowing for more complex behavior than simple fluctuations around a deterministic trend.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (stochastic calculus, financial modeling, and differential equations), applies them to a real-world scenario (asset pricing), and tests critical thinking about the implications of mathematical models in finance."}, "77": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/10/16", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/227820", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/2726/"], "docs_id": 227820, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to ask for a direct or indirect definition that would define the person who is actively working in a company.\n\nFor example in Linkedin I've seen the definition as `present` yet it does not fit my intend because I will define a database system with captions which will be shown directly as they are written in database captions.\n\nI would like to come up with a word like this:\n\n```\n- Name: Berker Yuceer\n- Age: 31\n- \"Actively Working\": True\n- Gender: M\n- Active: True // CV is Active\n\n```\n\nSo `present` not gonna be a good choise and it may lead the meaning `present in life`.\n\nActive also is not a good choise because I am using it to define if that CV is active or not.\n\nDepending on these matter I thought on simply writing `working` but it can be generalized to working on anything. \n\n**Example:** Working on a project.\n\nSo I am out of juice to solve this and looking for different ideas...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Employed](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/employed) can mean \"to provide with a job that pays wages or a salary\".

Such reference points **may** mark a division between two items, but they don't always do; that is not a part of the meaning of *landmark*.

Consequently, if one uses *landmark* metaphorically for an event in somebody's life, it only means that the event is noteworthy, memorable, suitable to use as a reference point.

Option B is incorrect as it promotes the use of global variables, which is generally discouraged.\n\nThe correct answer, C, not only solves the \"Undefined variable\" error but also addresses a critical security concern. By using filter_input() with FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, the developer can retrieve the URL parameter safely, preventing potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This approach combines solving the immediate problem with implementing a security best practice.\n\nFurthermore, this solution requires the developer to think critically about potential vulnerabilities in their code, going beyond just making it work. It encourages considering the broader implications of passing data through URLs and the importance of input validation in web applications.

The correct answer is C because inspecting and addressing potential moisture or structural issues is the most critical step before covering the wall.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by asking the homeowner to prioritize actions in a real-world scenario. Here's why C is correct and why the other options are less appropriate:\n\n1. Inspecting for moisture and structural issues is crucial because:\n   - The wall's exterior is inaccessible, making future repairs difficult.\n   - The partially missing paper backing could indicate existing problems.\n   - The age of the home (built in 1955) increases the likelihood of hidden issues.\n\n2. Option A (installing a vapor barrier) might be beneficial but is not the most critical step, especially since the garage is not planned to be insulated.\n\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Twin primes, except for (3, 5), can be represented as (6t-1, 6t+1) where t is a positive integer. This is a fundamental property of twin primes.\n\n2. The product of these twin primes is (6t-1)(6t+1) = 36t\u00b2 - 1.\n\n3. This product is always congruent to -1 modulo 9.

This approach aligns with Magento's architecture and best practices for several reasons:\n\n1. The initial attribute creation code includes 'customer_account_edit' and 'customer_account_create' in the 'forms' array, but this alone may not be sufficient for frontend display.\n\n2.

(though I have also empirically tested it with a [computer program](https://pastebin.com/raw/wFGJ54WZ)) I apologize if this question is too basic for mathoverflow; I am only doing pure mathematics for fun. I initially asked elsewhere but was advised to ask here. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not a reference, but a short proof.\n\nWe use the following (probably known, but see later) lemma on representing a symmetric tensor as a linear combination of rank\\-1 symmetric tensors.\n\n**Lemma.** Let $A$ be a finite set, $K$ an infinite field. Denote by $\\\\mathcal S$ the set of symmetric functions $p:A^n\\\\to K$. Then $\\\\mathcal S$ is the $K$\\-span of rank\\-one functions, that is, the functions of the type $h(x\\_1\\)h(x\\_2\\)\\\\ldots h(x\\_n)$, where $h:A\\\\to K$.\n\n**Proof.** Note that the product of two rank\\-one functions is a rank\\-one function. Thus the linear space $\\\\mathcal T$, generated by rank\\-one functions, coincides with the $K$\\-algebra generated by them.\n\nWe may suppose that $A\\\\subset K$. For $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$ denote $e\\_k(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n)$ the elementary symmetric polynomial, that is, $\\\\varphi\\_t(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n):\\=\\\\prod(1\\+tx\\_i)\\=\\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^n t^ke\\_k$. We identify $e\\_k$ and the corresponding element of $\\\\mathcal S$. Choosing $n\\+1$ distinct values $t\\_1,\\\\ldots,t\\_{n\\+1}\\\\in K$ and solving the corresponding (Vandermonde's) linear system of equations we represent each $e\\_k$ as a linear combinations of $\\\\varphi\\_{t\\_i}\\\\in \\\\mathcal T$. Thus $e\\_k\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ for all $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$. It is well known that $e\\_k$'s generate the algebra of symmetric polynomials (over any field). Thus any symmetric polynomial function belongs to $\\\\mathcal T$. It remains to note that any symmetric function $f\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ may be represented by a symmetric polynomial. Indeed, a symmetric function $f$ may be represented as $F(e\\_1,e\\_2,\\\\ldots,e\\_n)$ for certain function function $F$ defined on the corresponding finite set (because the values of $e\\_1,\\\\ldots,e\\_n$ determine the values of $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n$ up to permutation). $F$ in turn coincides with a polynomial function on this finite set. $\\\\square$\n\nNow we may prove your theorem for finitely supported function $i\\\\mapsto p\\_i$. Due to Lemma it may be supposed to have the form $p\\_i\\=\\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^n H(i\\_k)$ for a certain finitely supported function $H$ on $\\\\mathbb{N}$ (as OP, I denote here $\\\\mathbb{N}\\=\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots\\\\}$). In this case both parts of your identity are equal to $\\\\det (\\\\sum\\_m H(m)A^m)$.\n\n**Comment.** Lemma does not hold for finite fields. For example, if $A\\=K\\=\\\\{0,1\\\\}$. Then the function $x\\+y\\+z$ is not a linear combination of rank\\-one functions 1, $xyz$, $(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$: if $x\\+y\\+z\\=a\\+bxyz\\+c(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$, then for $y\\=0,z\\=1,x\\=a$ we get $0\\=1$.

A shell account that exists to run nothing and only establish the VPN connection.\n2. A main account that will run the programs you wish to ensure only get access to the network once it has been properly secured with a VPN.\n\nSo, with fast user switching enabled, you can log out of the main account. This ensures that no programs or processes from that user will continue running in the background. Most OS X apps are well behaved, and suspend network access when they don't have an active window on\\-screen, but you'd have to monitor and test this forever to be sure nothing is happening \\- logging out is simpler to maintain.\n\nNow, you could also replace \"account\" above with OS and run a virtualization system like Fusion (or Parallels or any other) and only start the guest OS once the host OS has secured everything on a VPN. Depending on the VM software you choose, you also may have control over the network and can turn on and off access even when the guest OS (or OSes) are running.
