There are two options:\n\n* Install a fully functional local TeX system. For that the obvious candidates would be MiKTeX, MacTeX, or TeXlive, and in terms of ease of installation for most students either MiKTeX (Windows) or MacTeX (OSX). (Linux users would probably want TeXlive, and may need to be warned about the tendency for distribution packages to be considerably out of date.)\n* Use a cloud\\-based system, of which the most commonly used is now [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)\n\nAlthough there are pros and cons to all these choices, there is a lot to be said for beginners in using a cloud\\-based approach in terms of your criteria. It offers a straightforward LaTeX compiler and editor, with nothing to install, and it works pretty intuitively. It's free for personal use. It's \"real LaTeX\" and mostly any document that compiles there will compile on other systems in the same way. There are good reasons for experienced users to prefer to maintain a local system and their are occasional disadvantages to being in the cloud: but as a way to get going quickly without installing anything, it may have much to say for it.\n\nTo my mind the main **practical** downsides are (1\\) occasionally the cloud\\-based systems lag behind bleeding edge TeX development (but that is unlikely to be a problem for most users) and (2\\) Overleaf seems to encourage the use of non\\-standard \"templates\", some of which are of dubious quality or utility, and which may not be portable.

Using the first 6 principal components strikes a balance between dimensionality reduction and maintaining a high level of accuracy in distance calculations. These 6 PCs explain approximately 90% of the variance (90.071% cumulative proportion), which is a common threshold used in PCA for retaining information while reducing dimensions.

Specifically, according to Wikipedia \"To each point on a Riemannian manifold, it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point.\". Now, I am confused. What does $R$ being determined means in the case. Does it mean I can use the metric, or some other quantity, to solve for the scalar curvature? If this is the case, why is the Hilbert\\-Einstein action contain both $R$ and $g$ if $R$ is solved from $g$? If this is not the case, then the Wikipedia explanation would be inside\\-out; would it rather be the scalar curvature that defines the intrinsic geometric of the manifold near that point?\n\nFor a given $g$, can $R$ be any choice of arbitrary, possibly smooth, function \\- each choice of $R$ defining a different manifold?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Riemannian geometry, there are in principle two fundamental quantities: the metric $g$ and the connection $\\\\nabla$. Each one may be chosen independently of the other, or even be left undefined (that is, you can have only the metric, or only the connection).\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R^a{}\\_{bcd}$ depends only on the connection, as can be seen from its expression in a coordinate chart:\n\n$$R^a{}\\_{bcd} \\= \\\\partial\\_c \\\\Gamma^a{}\\_{db} \\+ \\\\Gamma^a{}\\_{ce} \\\\Gamma^e{}\\_{db} \\- (c \\\\leftrightarrow d).$$\n\nThe Ricci tensor can be defined directly from this as $R\\_{bd} \\= R^a{}\\_{bad}$. If you also have a metric, you can define the curvature scalar as $R \\= g^{bd} R\\_{bd}$.\n\nYou can see that in general, the curvature scalar depends on both the metric and the connection. If you have one of them (say, the metric) and you want to choose $R$ as an independent quantity, you'll have to set up equations and see if you can choose the other one (the connection if you fixed the metric) so that $R$ equals your desired function; this may or may not be possible in general, I don't know.\n\nThis is the general situation, but in general relativity the connection is not independent; we use the Levi\\-Civita connection, which depends only on the metric, so that all the other quantities also depend only on the metric. And the same logic applies: if you want $R$ to be some specific function, you might be able to choose a metric that gives you your desired $R$, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAnd to answer your last paragraph: the EH action (or the field equations) contain $R$, but it is understood that it is really a function of the metric, which we don't write out explicitly because, well, it's just $R$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of general relativity and differential geometry, which of the following statements about the scalar curvature R is most accurate?\n\nA) The scalar curvature R is completely independent of the metric g and can be chosen arbitrarily for any given manifold.\n\nB) The scalar curvature R is solely determined by the connection \u2207, regardless of the metric g.\n\nC) In general relativity, the scalar curvature R is a function of the metric g through the Levi-Civita connection, but choosing a specific R doesn't guarantee a unique corresponding metric.\n\nD) The scalar curvature R directly defines the intrinsic geometry of a manifold, and the metric g is derived from R.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because in general relativity, we use the Levi-Civita connection, which is determined by the metric g. This means the scalar curvature R is indeed a function of the metric, but it's not a simple or direct relationship. Choosing a specific R doesn't guarantee a unique corresponding metric, as the relationship is complex and involves solving differential equations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because R is not independent of the metric in general relativity.\n\nOption B is partially true in a more general context of Riemannian geometry, but not in the specific framework of general relativity where the connection is not independent of the metric.\n\nOption D reverses the relationship between R and the geometry.

Changing the port forward to route to the laptop's port 80 (which has Apache running), instead of 22 yields no difference in the result.\n\nI can confirm that inside my LAN I can SSH into this laptop with no issues. That assures me that the laptop's ssh daemon is running. I have no trouble ssh out from this machine.\n\nI can confirm the router is not doing the blocking because I can run tcpdump on the router looking for this port and it receives it and passes it on. \n\nI've run `tcpdump` on this laptop and examining the PCAP in Wireshark I can see the packet coming in on port 22 and subsequent attempts by the remote operator retrying the connection, but I just haven't found the right tutorial on analyzing a packet for this issue to help me see what might be the cause.\n\n> 41 3\\.349934 remoteIP 192\\.168\\.1\\.105 TCP 74 45166 \u2192 22 \\[SYN] Seq\\=0 Win\\=14600 Len\\=0 MSS\\=1460 SACK\\_PERM\\=1 TSval\\=1415111467 TSecr\\=0 WS\\=512\n\nPerhaps someone can shed light on what this means?\n\nI attempted to install Mojave on another machine to see if it is a Mojave issue but every other machine is too old to run it so I'm unable to isolate that it's the hardware or software on this machine. Speaking of which, this behavior occurs when I'm routing to the laptop through the wireless and Ethernet/Thunderbolt of the laptop which would suggest that if it's hardware, it's not the networking ports causing the issue.\n\nSince the port forwarding rules are the same except for the source and destination ports, I'm leaning on thinking something changed in Mojave as that's the only change I've recall that I made to the laptop when this capability broke.\n\nLooking online, I found the closest which suggests that Apple has closed off certain folders to remote users.

That seems to eliminate that it's my firewall on the router that is blocking any of these odd ports to this laptop. Which points more likely that Mojave is blocking port 22 from outside its subnet.\n\nI can show screen cap that shows this Mojave firewall is turned off if important.\n\nThat's why I ask here, instead of another networking forum as it seems to be only the Mojave OSX machine that is rejecting port 22\\.

You can consults the `man ssh_config` for more details, here's the excerpt for that option:\n\n> ```\n>  IPQoS   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for connections.

If two\n>          values are specified, the first is automatically selected for interactive sessions and the\n>          second for non-interactive sessions.  The default is af21 (Low-Latency Data) for interactive\n>          sessions and cs1 (Lower Effort) for non-interactive sessions.\n> \n> ```\n\nYou can of course pass it via CLI like so as well:\n\n```\n$ ssh -o IPQoS=throughput joeuser@192.168.1.1\n\n```\n\nIf find you're not having any luck with the above you may want to try this form instead:\n\n```\nHost *\n     IPQoS lowdelay throughput\n\n```\n\nSeveral [threads mention this form](https://superuser.com/questions/1373697/ssh-fails-on-macos-mojave-10-14-1/1373701#1373701) working as well.\n\n### References\n\n* [ssh man page](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is experiencing SSH connection issues after upgrading their MacBook to macOS Mojave.

I got a 0\\.75\" drill bit from Home Depot (DEWALT 3/4 in. Black Oxide Reduced Shank Drill Bit) that I was told is appropriate for metal. I used a punch to create a pilot dent. I then tried to use the 0\\.75\" bit but it kept on slipping. I did some research and it said that you could drill a pilot hole but that it shouldn't be more than 25% of the target size.

The type of vibration and unevenness of the hole from that type of bit is not uncommon in my experience, and may not really matter in the end if the exact hole size does not need to be very precise.\n\nWhile the bit might be dull, more likely it is harder to cut as you go deeper because initially more and more material has to be removed on each revolution, and also friction of the bit against the hole increases.\n\nTips:\n\n* Some lubrication (cutting oil \\- but in a pinch any oil may help) may stress the tools less\n* You can push hard but if you seem to stress the motor of your drill (you'll hear this) back off somewhat. Also pay attention to how hot the motor / casing is getting. Warm is OK but very hot or a burning smell is obviously going too far.\n* Be cautious as the bit starts to pass through the far side. Unique to drilling metal (as opposed to wood) *the flutes of the bit may tend to \"bite in\"* and you could get a sudden and significant wrenching action on your arm, hand, thumb, etc. Hold the drill very securely, use an extension handle if you have it, and maybe brace it with your body. For the last bit of depth I would push more lightly but spin the bit quite fast.\n* The hole may turn out to be a little smaller than 3/4\" (or whatever exact size the bit really is, such as 47/64ths). That may seem impossible but if you think about what the cross\\-sectional shape of a slice of the bit looks like it may make more sense (its not a circle).\n* If the hole is rough you may need to file it down by hand before using it.

I chose \"noon\" for simplicity.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would still consider *noon* a noun (one that can by itself constitute an entire noun phrase/NP, so in this regard behaving more like a pronoun than like a regular noun such as *day*) in that context.\n\nRelated Linguistics SE post: [Adverbs as NP pre\\-modifiers](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/19628/adverbs-as-np-pre-modifiers)\n\nIn general, I believe many modern linguists consider it false to say that no adverb can modify a noun or noun phrase. (BillJ has left comments indicating that what's going on here is an adverb modifying a noun phrase.)\n\nI found what looks like a relevant chapter \"[Adverbs, Noun Phrases, and Determiners](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Extag/tech-report/node167.html)\" in the report *A Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar for English* (The XTAG Research Group, Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, University of Pennsylvania, [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/\\~xtag](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Extag)).\n\nThe authors state\n\n> Many adverbs interact with the noun phrase and determiner system in English. \\[...] Although there is some debate in the literature as to whether these should be classified as determiners or adverbs, we believe that these items that interact with the NP and determiner system are in fact adverbs.\n\nThey in fact list *exactly,* but describe it in a way that doesn't seem to account for the usage with *noon* that you asked about:\n\n> the class of adverbs that modify cardinal determiners. This class includes, among others, the adverbs about, at most, exactly, nearly, and only. These adverbs have the single restriction that they must adjoin to determiners that are **card\\+**.\n\nBased on the description of determiner [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinctive_feature#Other_uses) in the chapter \"[Determiners and Noun Phrases](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Extag/tech-report/node162.html)\", the class of \"determiners that are **card\\+**\" (or positive for the feature \"cardinal\") seems to consist only of cardinal numbers such as *one, two, three...*. All other determiners, such as *all, both, this, the, a/an* are shown as \"**card\\-**\" in the table on that page. This analysis does work for examples like \"exactly three o'clock\" and \"exactly three twenty\\-five\".\n\nI think other examples to consider are \"I ran exactly a mile\", \"At almost exactly the moment when...\", \"at exactly that second\", \"at exactly the moment\", \"at exactly this time\". Most examples I can think of do use a determiner of some kind (although contrary to the chapter, they are not exclusively cardinal numbers) and you I guess could consider the adverb to be modifying the determiner rather than the noun phrase (although that feels a bit iffy to me with \"exactly the\")."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the phrase \"exactly noon\", which of the following best describes the grammatical function of \"exactly\"?\n\nA) It's an adverb modifying the verb (which is implied but not stated)\nB) It's an adverb modifying the noun \"noon\"\nC) It's an adjective modifying \"noon\"\nD) It's a determiner specifying the precise time\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While traditionally adverbs were not thought to modify nouns, modern linguistic analysis recognizes that some adverbs can indeed modify noun phrases. In \"exactly noon\", \"exactly\" is functioning as an adverb that modifies the noun \"noon\". This usage is similar to phrases like \"exactly three o'clock\" or \"nearly midnight\", where the adverb provides precision to the time expression.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no implied verb in this phrase. Option C is wrong because \"exactly\" is an adverb, not an adjective. Option D is incorrect because while \"exactly\" does specify the precise time, it's doing so as an adverb, not a determiner.\n\nThis question tests understanding of non-traditional adverb usage and challenges the common misconception that adverbs can only modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/16", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/170809", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/52466/"], "docs_id": 170809, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Im trying to make a low power application feeding it from a 9vAC, source, i have been reading that i can use a half wave instead of a full wave rectifier, i already did the circuit and been doing tests \n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/n72eM.jpg)\n\nUsing the osciloscope you can see the wave forms from the Vin, the output of the diode, and finally the output odf the diode using a Avg sampling, im not sure if this waveform is enough to power a microcontroler using 3\\.3v im thinking about increasing the Cap value, and see how it modifies the rize, however, my main concern here is, how can i justify to do this instead of a full wave rectifier?, and also how can i make sure i will get the steady, 3\\.3v with as little noise as possible? \n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XJb7.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not sure what the third screen represents.

The rise is from the fast charging of the capacitor, and the fall is caused by the drain current from resistor R. I suspect that the small rapid fall in the capacitor voltage is caused by non\\-ideal behaviour of the capacitor (perhaps it is an electrolytic capacity with significant internal serial inductance).\n\nTo power the microprocessor, you need to install a regulator between the filter capacitor and the microcprocessor circuit. Options include linear regulators or switch\\-mode regulators. The former are easier. Through\\-hole options include LP2950\\-33LPRE3 or LM3940IT\\-3\\.3\\. In either case, you will need a second capacitor to filter the 3\\.3V output.

The files are stored in a web repository, and the tool takes care of downloading and caching automagically when it encounters the dependency. It also eliminates extra setup (NAS configuration) for people who want to run the test.

And if you decide something doesn't belong in a RCS, what are your alternatives? It's an easier decision if you limit your choices between the RCS and a binary repo (maven style).\n\nIdeally, you'd only want in the RCS stuff that is humanely editable, diffable, or where you'd want to track the history.

I tried this with the Audio MIDI app (creating 1 aggregate device with the two inputs) of macOS and judging from the input level in system preferences it seems to work. Now I wanted to use this as the audio input in Zoom, however this did not work. It seems that Zoom somehow only took some of those channels effectively discarding one of the two microphones. Hence my question: is there some way to combine two inputs (ideally adjust their levels) and feed that to zoom?\n\nI have read a couple of similar questions (just without zoom reference) such as [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274090/mono-output-from-an-external-dac/274103#274103), but they mostly to point to Audio Hijack which looks great, but I find it ridiculously expensive for such a little task.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem with [aggregate devices in macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000) is, I think, that the different input microphones will be assigned to different channels. Zoom might pick up only the first channel of the aggregate device rather than mixing all the channels together.\n\nUsing a virtual audio device and a mixer software, one could mix the different microphones together into one channel of the virtual device and then select the virtual device as microphone in Zoom. Originally, I was thinking of [soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) (`brew install soundflower`) or [vb\\-cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (`brew install vb-cable`), maybe in addition to [obs](http://obsproject.com) (`brew install obs`) for mixing. But as [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) has been mentioned in the comments, let's try this one:\n\n> BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.\n\n1. Install the [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh)\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n```\n2. Install the [BlackHole virtual audio device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)\n\n```\nbrew install blackhole-2ch\n\n```\n3. Install a mixer software that will be used to combine the microphone sources. You can use [Apple Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) if you have it, or you can use [obs](http://obsproject.com) (free). Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get it working with [Apple GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/garageband/id682658836?l=en&mt=12), because this couldn't handle both microphones simultaneously. Here, I'm using obs.\n\n```\nbrew install obs\n\n```\n4. In obs, in the \"sources\" section, add the first microphone as \"Audio Input Capture\".\n\n[![add Audio Input Capture source](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsDzf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsDzf.png)\n\n[![select your microphone](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZjDs.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZjDs.png)\n5.

When a service is masked, it not only prevents the service from starting automatically (which is what disabling does), but it also prevents the service from being started manually. This is achieved by creating a symlink from the service file to /dev/null. Disabling a service, on the other hand, only prevents it from starting automatically but still allows manual starts. Both masking and disabling are considered permanent changes until explicitly reversed. Option B is incorrect because masking doesn't delete the file.

If they do not match, they are not allowed into the game.\n\nThis effectively means that if someone wants to join the server as you, they'll also need access to your Microsoft/Mojang account. You should be more worried if you are hacked on an online server than an offline one.\n\nIf you do not have an internet connection, no players will be able to join in online mode.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason to disable it, don't, as it also enables the usage of player skins, and since you are running an SMP, you cannot change your mind easily \\- all inventories and other player data will be lost.\n\nIf you are running a public server, definitely don't.\n\nOffline Mode\n------------\n\nOffline mode does not make a difference in terms of performance, and definitely not a negative one. It actually shaves a few seconds off the login time, but still doesn't effect the overall performance, as this is handled separately.\n\nOffline mode simply disables authentication, meaning that the server does not know if I player is who they say they are.\n\nIn offline mode, any player joining the game is allowed in with whatever name they please. If there is a whitelist, it will still work, but a player can bypass it by changing their name.\n\nHowever, offline mode does have its advantages. If you do not have access to the internet, you can still continue to play on your locally hosted server. If you are messing around with Bukkit plugins while in a car ([but not if you're driving it](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Splash)), or in space (as you often do) this may be useful. Of course, you can use a Wi\\-Fi Hotspot on your phone (unless in space), or just use a single\\-player world.\n\nOffline mode is also useful if you want to be able to use any username. For example, if you are working on a multiplayer Minecraft minigame, it can be useful to test it with multiple players, without buying another account. It can also be used if your friend does not own a Minecraft account, and they want to try the game before buying it. \\*\n\n\\* I'm not encouraging piracy.

I'm familiar with the concept of multiplexing, but I don't really understand how the MCU handles it with pins :\n\nWill it switch very fast at something like twice the peripherals's speed to swap the pin function everytime and let each peripheral do its stuff ? Does that mean I'll have to take additional safety measures when designing my PCB since both my SD card connector's data pin 0 and my DAC's I2S data pin will share the same MCU pin and therefore have linked traces ? Does pin multiplexing somehow decrease efficiency of both multiplexed peripherals on the pin ?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You did not get the concept of multiplexing quit right. Think of it as 'custom' routing within the IC itself. You can decide what function to use on which pins during runtime. Sure, you can switch very fast too \\- but where is the point of having an ADC and an SD card on the same lanes? I guess your data flow looks like: ADC \\-\\> Logic in Controller \\-\\> SD card.\nSo you effectively cut your bandwidth in half here by using the same pins. But not only that. You go from dead simple to pain in the ass really fast.\n\nMultiplexing is designed to ease up the PCB routing and allow for special needs. But your intention will afaik not work as desired. A classic use case would be: Oh, I need two I2C busses in the somewhat same region of the board. Sets switch pins in a way, that I can route them in parallel and not mess up my whole PCB layout. Or another: You have an extension bus where you can either use I2C or SPI for some sort of management. The slave card signals what type of interface to use \\- thereby you choose pins which can be I2C or SPI. Or you have only two I2C 'peripherals in your controller, but want to use four different devices on individual busses. You hook up the devices on separate lanes and switch the internal workings as needed \\- where is the point of the 'bus' at all in this case i hear you ask? Well, you could reduce track length, ease up rounting and other stuff this way.\n\nYou can for sure make your usecase work with some carefull consideration on some logic gaes and stuff. But it will not work out of the box.\n\nBut my advice: Use two different peripherials for this job."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a board using an ATSAMS70 microcontroller and discovers that the I2S data out pin is multiplexed with the SD card interface data 0 pin.

The correct approach is to select which function (I2S or SD card) to use on the shared pin during runtime, based on the current needs of the application.

In this way each node could handle several thousand API calls per second, without pushing the complication and expense of a high volume of traffic deeper into the infrastructure.\n\nThis yielded a reasonably accurate and low latency running total for each account.

Depending on your data, this could lead to several clusters: high buildings, low buildings, surrounding landscape. There are some issues, for example, a high tree might be just as high as a low building. \n\nAlternatively, you could perform some kind of (un)supervised classification in which you could use the height information and possibly other source of information such as not only the height information at the current location, but also the surrounding height.\n\nOnce you've determined which area of the map could be classified as city, or urban area, you could provide statistics such as mean and variance to describe the height and variations in the height.\n\nWhich analysis works well also depends on which data you are going to use. Very high resolution LIDAR data supports other analysis than very coarse SRTM images. Also take care that some height products have compensated for buildings as they where not interested in them.\n\nThen there is the question of how to do this kind of analysis. I use R and other high level programming languages to do this. These tools have a steep learning curve, but provide ultimate flexibility.

What's wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This message usually appears when a system uses a certified bus\\-powered USB hub (hub power and power for all it's ports are coming from a single upstream cable from host). In this case the system knows (via hub descriptors) that this is bus\\-powered hub, and therefore it must have the natural limits of how much power can be theoretically taken from upstream, and delivered to downstream ports.\n\nTherefore the bus\\-powered hubs are allowed to allocate only a fraction of power that is normally available from normal ports (500 or 900 mA) and from self\\-powered hubs (powered from external AC\\-DC adapters). To prevent the hub upstream port (host downstream) from overloading, USB has a two\\-step mechanism.\n\nFirst step is an informative. USB devices must take only 100/150 mA from VBUS to respond with device descriptors. The device descriptor(s) have an information on how much current it is expecting to use under full\\-functional mode, its maximum. The system reads this information, and, knowing whether the hub can or can't (theoretically) supply this power, it may or may not proceed with final step of device configuration, SET\\_CONFIG(). If the system determines that the port does have enough power, it finishes the enumeration. If this is a bus\\-powered hub (100 mA per port), and device declares the use of 500 mA, the system won't proceed with configuration and will display the warning message. Thus the device will be rejected. Whether the device really consumes that current remains however unknown.\n\nIn fact, in USB 2\\.0 power management schema of things, the \"high\\-power\" device will not be admitted even if other ports don't have anything plugged in, and theoretically the hub might have enough resource to power it up. This is a major inconvenience from user standpoint. To avoid this inconvenience, USB industry has invented illegal \"semi\\-self\\-powered\" hubs, tyhe hubs who can be bus\\-powered, but don't report this in their descriptors, fooling the host system into thinking that this is a normal self\\-powered hub, so no restrictions will be imposed. The rest is up to user's lack or luck thereof.\n\nSo, it looks like you have a misfortune (or fortune) to have a certified USB hub that plays nicely, in accord with USB specifications. To avoid this messages either use a self\\-powered hub, or use the bootleg hubs that don't report their bus\\-powered status, and pray that the host port has enough power to drive whatever devices you are plugging into the hub without losing much of VBUS voltage level."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for the \"Unknown USB device needs more power than the Port can Supply\" message, and what is the recommended solution?\n\nA) The USB device is malfunctioning and drawing too much power. Replace the device.\nB) The USB port on the computer is faulty. Use a different port or repair the computer.\nC) The device is connected to a certified bus-powered USB hub with limited power allocation. Use a self-powered hub instead.\nD) The operating system has a bug in its USB power management. Update the system drivers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The message typically appears when a device is connected to a certified bus-powered USB hub. These hubs have limited power allocation per port (usually 100 mA) due to drawing power from the host computer. If a device requires more power than the hub can provide, the system won't configure it and displays this warning. \n\nThe recommended solution is to use a self-powered hub, which has its own power supply and can provide more current to connected devices. Alternatively, one could use a \"semi-self-powered\" hub that doesn't report its bus-powered status, though this is not an official solution and may carry risks.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as the issue is not with the device or computer port, but with the hub's power limitations. Option D is also incorrect as this is not a bug, but a designed feature of USB power management to prevent overloading."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/10", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/508964", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/98075/"], "docs_id": 508964, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Following up on my [previous](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/508620/baffled-by-cosine-similarity-these-results-seem-counterintuitive) [questions](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/508784/how-can-you-rank-items-by-the-magnitude-of-their-effect-on-cosine-similarity) I'll start with the basics and hopefully the community could help me find a solution!\n\nI have distinct groups of users, let's say they are grouped by geographic region (N. America, Europe, APAC, etc.). I also have various metrics about how they interact with my service.\n\nFor example, if I'm YouTube, this could be consumption (measured by consumption time or number of different videos) of videos by their category (let's say there are a 1000 distinct categories). I also have some other data, like the device they use, timestamp for every video they watched, etc.\n\nWhat I want to do is compare the different geographies to users in North America. For each I want a quantifiable measure how their consumption is different than the consumption of North America users, and I'd like a way to flag (or stack rank) the dimensions they're different in, e.g. people in Europe watch a proportionally large volume of pub quiz related videos.\n\nI was thinking to go about it with cosine similarity, which would allow me to put different geographies on a 0 to 1 scale, but completely open to your suggestions!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Just some thoughts on grouping by geographic region.\n\nIt occurred to me, that I may have more in common (albeit a language different), as a US consumer, with a German consumer. Why? Because both of us are products of progressive affluence democratic western societies with a common world view.\n\nIn essence, views and tastes are societally related and not fundamentally geographically dictated/generated.\n\nAs an example, Germany and Turkey (or Iran) may not too far from each other geographically, but are definitively distinct from a societally perspective.\n\nOne way to group these countries, is perhaps, similarities in music taste (as in the sales of the same record) or common history or forms of government,...\n\nSo, I am suggesting perhaps a different construct than geographic location may produce more meaningful results.\n\n\\[EDIT] On associated methodology, see, for example, Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Mar., 1982\\), pp. 453\\-455 (3 pages), an interesting article \"Life Styles and Consumption Patterns\" by Stephen C.

Instead, it proposes that societal and lifestyle factors may be more influential in determining consumption patterns. The answer gives examples such as similarities in music taste, common history, or forms of government as potentially more meaningful grouping criteria. \n\nOption B aligns most closely with this advice, proposing to cluster users based on lifestyle factors rather than strict geographic boundaries. This approach is likely to yield more insightful results about user behavior, as it takes into account cultural and societal similarities that may transcend geographic proximity.\n\nOption A, while being the original approach considered by the questioner, is less ideal according to the given advice.

Does it make sense to spend time and resources on researching and building laser weapons in the mid\\-game, when you are going to replace them with plasma weapons in the late\\-game anyway? Especially considering that you can get plasma weapons for free by stunning aliens.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I just played a play\\-through where I completely ignored the laser tech tree. This is what I found out:\n\n* The early game gets more challenging. You will still have the starting weapons when you are facing floater and when you have bad luck and play on a high difficulty even when you encounter the first mutons and cyberdisks. You also need to focus a lot more on capturing, which is an additional risk factor.\n* The mid\\-game gets considerably easier because you have earlier access to plasma weapons. That means you will be stronger and you save resources for more important things like base building and interception upgrades.\n\nThe plasma pistol is not really a priority. It is just a tiny bit worse than the assault rifle (same damage, but it lacks the 10% crit bonus). Its only advantage is that it has infinite ammo. But that alone doesn't make it a serious upgrade. So until you capture your first light plasma rifle, you should rather focus on getting other key techs like better armors, the satellite nexus and the firestorm. \n\nAs soon as you encounter the first aliens with light plasma rifles, you should focusing on obtaining as many as possible. Your goal is to obtain 7 units \\- one for research and 6 for your soldiers. This will be the most challenging phase of the game, because you will be outgunned and because you have to take additional risks to capture aliens alive. But as soon as your research is finished and you can hand your first light plasma rifles to your assault and support soldiers, you will have the playing field leveled.\n\nFrom now on you can research the rest of the plasma tree without obtaining the alien weapons. When you are lucky, you will be able to finish researching the normal plasma rifle before even finding the first one. But be patient \\- they are much too expensive to produce yourself. Wait for the aliens to deliver them to you. \n\nNow it's time to farm normal plasma rifles and gradually replace the light ones. You will notice that your heavies and snipers are very underpowered in this phase of the game, because they are still using terrestrial guns, while your support and assault soldiers have already reached the endgame. I would still take at least one squadsight sniper on missions during this phase of the game, but heavies aren't useful right now, so they can stay in the base. Fortunately, you can easily train new rookies in this phase of the game, because thanks to the plasma rifles they will be quite powerful. \n\nThe lack of power of your snipers and heavies will change when you researched the plasma sniper and the heavy plasma gun. The plasma sniper must be built, but thanks to not buying any weapons until now, you should have saved up enough resources for that by now. Heavy plasmas can be farmed, but they don't show up before you encounter muton elites. So when you can afford it, you should build one or two.\n\nI don't find the alloy shotgun very useful. Sure, it does more damage, but I still prefer the plasma rifle for my assault troopers, because the better range makes them much more versatile."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the strategy described, which of the following sequences best represents the progression of weapon upgrades for assault and support soldiers when skipping the laser weapons research?\n\nA) Conventional weapons \u2192 Light plasma rifles \u2192 Plasma rifles \u2192 Alloy cannon\nB) Conventional weapons \u2192 Laser rifles \u2192 Light plasma rifles \u2192 Plasma rifles\nC) Conventional weapons \u2192 Light plasma rifles \u2192 Plasma rifles\nD) Conventional weapons \u2192 Laser rifles \u2192 Plasma rifles\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The strategy outlined in the documentation suggests skipping the laser weapons tech tree entirely. For assault and support soldiers, the progression is:\n\n1. Start with conventional weapons\n2. Focus on capturing light plasma rifles from aliens\n3. Equip soldiers with light plasma rifles once research is complete\n4. Gradually replace light plasma rifles with normal plasma rifles as they become available\n\nThe strategy specifically mentions that the alloy shotgun (alloy cannon) is not considered very useful compared to the plasma rifle for assault troopers. It also emphasizes skipping laser weapons, making options B and D incorrect. Option A is incorrect because it includes the alloy cannon, which is not recommended in this strategy. Therefore, option C best represents the weapon progression for assault and support soldiers in this approach."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/06", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/36996", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/833/"], "docs_id": 36996, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a real\\-time program **goes off the deep end**, the system can become unresponsive.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is one of several idioms related to the dangers of deep water.
