The first command uses pdfjam to create a new PDF (other-a4.pdf) by shifting the content of the original half-page PDF (half-a4.pdf) down by 148.5mm, which is half the height of an A4 page. The second command uses pdftk to overlay the original PDF on top of the shifted PDF, resulting in a full A4 page with the content duplicated.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it shifts the content up instead of down and reverses the order of the pdftk command.\nOption C is incorrect because it uses the wrong offset for horizontal shifting, which is not needed in this case.\nOption D is incorrect because it attempts to stamp the PDF onto itself before shifting, which would not produce the desired result."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/30", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/78934", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/10260/"], "docs_id": 78934, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I was levelling my demon hunter I was able to use vault to quickly get away from an area where damage was happening or smoke screen to break freezes and jailer cages.\n\nI've had some difficulty with arcane, jailer, frozen as they can really stack up quickly.\n\nI do use ignore pain to great effect, but that doesn't help against everything.\n\nWhat can I do on a barbarian to counter the various elite affixes?

If we say that the second order coframe bundle is defined to be the set of all choices of a point of the coframe bundle and a torsion\\-free pseudoconnection 1\\-form at that point, then the structure group of the second order coframe bundle as a bundle over the first order coframe bundle is exactly your $S^2 \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\*} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{R}^n$: any two such pseudoconnections differ by an element of the first prolongation of the general linear group. If instead we define the second order coframe bundle to be the set of all 2\\-jets of local coordinates, then those with a given 1\\-jet (i.e. over the same point of the coframe bundle) agree up to arbitrary quadratic terms, i.e. structure group $S^2 \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\*} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{R}^n$. The terminology in formal differential geometry (or whatever this sort of thing is called) is not standardized much.\n\nA torsion\\-free connection is a section of $FM^1 \\\\to FM$, equivariant for the general linear group. So I don't think you really don't get an action of the structure group of $FM^1 \\\\to M$ on $S^2 \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\*} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{R}^n$ arising in this way: you are not making a difference between connections when you act by the structure group; you are making a pseudoconnection form move to a different point of the coframe bundle.

In the course of correcting his mistakes...\n\nWell it is true we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for electricians these days. However, honestly, this sounds like something else entirely: it sounds like a person who *knows a little bit* about electricity and has... well, we used to call it \"sophomoric\", but a pair of scientists named Dunning and Kruger made a more in\\-depth study.\n\nI'm afraid I'm not referring to the electrician :)\n\nIt is readily apparent that a) you're seeing a lot of stuff that is \"New to You\"... and b) you're doing a lot of random stuff that seems right, but you don't actually know. At least, you are asking...\n\nReceptacles must match the breaker.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis is NEC 210\\.21\\.\n\n15A receptacles belong on 15A circuits.  \n\n20A receptacles belong on 20A circuits.  \n\nThere is an exception allowing 15A receptacles on 20A circuits *if there are 2 or more sockets* because 15A devices are internally rated for 20A pass\\-through. *Not 30A*.  \n\n30A receptacles belong on 30A circuits. That is it, no crossovers, no exceptions.\n\nThat receptacle you're familiar with that you've seen everywhere, has *2* sockets for purpose of the above.\n\nYou will need to change each receptacle and spur on that circuit to a 30A receptacle. You may use a NEMA TT30, NEMA 6\\-30 or NEMA 14\\-30\\.\n\n\"I don't want to do that, though!\"\n\nWire is always allowed to be larger\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnytime Code requires wire be a particular size, you are always allowed to use a larger size. There is no penalty for this, except the practical difficulty of fitting the larger wire to terminals.\n\nThe exception is that if conductors are enlarged, grounds must be enlarged in proportion, but that works fine with \\#10\\.\n\nWhat this means is you're in perfectly good standing to have \\#10 wire in a 20A or 15A circuit.\n\nEnlarging wires is often done to compensate for *voltage drop* on a long cable run, or because old wiring (e.g. from a decommissioned electric dryer or range) is being re\\-purposed for new circuits.\n\nThe circuit size is the smallest wire size in it.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn residential, where the Tap Rules are generally unavailable, the circuit size is defined by the smallest (in\\-wall) wires in it. If a circuit has a mix of \\#10, \\#12 and \\#14 wire, it must be a 15A circuit.\n\nIf a circuit has a mix of \\#12 and \\#10 wire, it must be a 20A circuit (15A is acceptable).\n\nIt can only be a 30A circuit if every single wire in the walls is 30A (\\#10 copper).\n\nGenerally anything with \\#10, \\#14 and \\#12 is defined by NEC 240\\.4\\. It cuts out some *really weird* exceptions for certain motor and welder loads, but this is generally not something you'll encounter on receptacle and light wiring.\n\n*Multi\\-Wire Branch Circuits* are a thing\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAKA shared\\-neutral or \"Edison\" circuits (for whom we have to 'thank'). These are \\+110V and \\-110V (at least in Edison's day) with neutral in the middle. Only 3 wires are needed \\+ ground, but it has the performance of 2 circuits. The neutral handles only differential current.\n\nThese must be phased correctly to avoid overloading neutral \\- the 2 phases must be 240V apart, not 0V apart. They cannot land on a tandem. To protect maintainers, they must have \"handle ties\" or be a 2\\-pole breaker.\n\nThe difference is that handle\\-ties do not provide *common trip* and most 2\\-pole breakers do. However **MWBCs do not require common trip** if they serve only 120V loads. (yeah, they can serve 240V loads *also*, and then, they need common trip).\n\nMWBCs also require that neutral be *pigtailed* and do not use the device itself for splicing neutral. Neutral must remain continuous even if the device is removed.\n\nCleaning it up\n--------------\n\nThe only mistake you have described is lack of handle ties on a MWBC. That's a common error, I'm not going to judge the electrician incompetent over that. Hopefully they are on opposite poles (240V between them).\n\n> Everything I've read tells me that, as far as the math goes, that's okay because the neutral is still only handling 30 amps, which 10 AWG can handle.\n\nYou didn't read that in NEC/CEC. You might get away with it on the \\#10, but what about the \\#12 or \\#14 beyond the \\#10? You haven't fully mapped the circuit and don't know what all the wire sizes are.\n\nIf you have mapped the whole circuit and found nothing smaller than \\#12, then you can use 20A as long as there are 2 sockets on each leg (or the 1 socket is 20A). If you have 15A on *one* leg but the other is all 20A wire, then you can use a 15A and 20A breaker with a handle tie.

There is a shortest distance between these points along the great circle connecting $A$ and $B$, and this great circle is a geodesic.

This question tests understanding of Fermat's principle, geodesics on a sphere, and the concept of local maxima in optical paths. \n\nThe great circle connecting two points on a sphere represents the geodesic, or the path of least distance on the surface. In this case, the great circle path would initially move away from point B (appearing to take a \"longer\" route) before curving towards it. This counterintuitive path actually represents the shortest distance on the sphere's surface and aligns with Fermat's principle of least time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because light cannot travel through the planet's interior.

This method aligns with the ACL's purpose of preventing external system idioms and behaviors from leaking into the bounded context. By wrapping external exceptions into context-specific ones, it maintains the integrity of the bounded context's domain language while still preserving the original error information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it allows external system concepts to leak into the bounded context, which goes against the purpose of an ACL.\n\nOption B is problematic because suppressing exceptions can hide important error information and make debugging more difficult.\n\nOption D oversimplifies error handling and loses valuable context-specific information, making it harder to diagnose and respond to different types of errors appropriately.\n\nThe correct approach (C) not only handles exceptions but also encourages developers to consider various error scenarios, including those not directly related to client exceptions, such as incoherent results or unexpected HTTP statuses.

What can we generally say if the sum of squares for a factor is many times larger than another factor? I am having difficulty interpreting this as it involves interactions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The random variable $Y$ describes a relationship between events and the corresponding probabilities of those events. In more practical terms, a random variable describes a *data\\-generating process*. When you generate a random data point that is described by the random variable $Y$, the probability distribution of $Y$ describes the probability distribution of values that can result.\n\nYou can think of a \"population\" as an infinite reservoir of values drawn from $Y$. Sampling from a population is analogous to repeatedly drawing new values from $Y$. A sample of size $N$ is a size\\-$N$ collection of individual draws from $Y$.\n\nThe sample is clearly not the same thing as the random variable itself, so we need a different notation for it. Let's call it $s \\= \\\\{y\\_1, y\\_2, \\\\dots, y\\_N \\\\}$. Each $y\\_n$ is a single draw from $Y$. The sample mean is a single number. Let's call it $\\\\bar s$. It is the mean of the sequence $s$, i.e. $\\\\bar s \\= \\\\frac{y\\_1 \\+ y\\_2 \\+ \\\\dots \\+ y\\_N}{N}$.\n\nWe can make an interesting observation here! $N$ independent, identical draws from a random variable $Y$ is the same thing as one draw from each of $N$ independent, identical random variables $Y\\_n$. Now, we can talk about the sample itself as a random variable $S \\= \\\\{ Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N \\\\}$.\n\nNote the difference between\n\n$$\ns \\= \\\\{ y\\_1, \\\\dots, y\\_N \\\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nS \\= \\\\{ Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N \\\\}\n$$\n\n$S$ is random: it is a sequence of random variables. $s$ is not random. It is the realized value of a draw from $S$, i.e. a sequence of realized values of draws from $Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N$.\n\nTherefore **the sample mean itself can be restated as a random variable $\\\\bar S$**.\n\nCompare\n\n$$\n\\\\bar s \\= \\\\frac{ y\\_1 \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ y\\_N}{N}\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\\\bar S \\= \\\\frac{ Y\\_1 \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ Y\\_N}{N}\n$$\n\n$\\\\bar s$ is just a number: it is the mean of a sequence of numbers $y\\_1, \\\\cdots, y\\_N$. But $\\\\bar S$ is a random variable! Specifically, it is a *statistic*, a single quantity that is calculated from a sample. The value of a statistic for a specific sample is a realization of the distribution for that statistic.\n\nBeing a random variable, draws from $\\\\bar S$ are described by a probability distribution. The distribution of sample means, across all possible samples, is described by the distribution of $\\\\bar S$. This distribution is the *sampling distribution of the mean*.\n\nWith regard to your first question, you are probably confused between the *random variable $Y$* and the *matrix $Y$*. It is an unfortunate clash in notation that random variables and matrices are both conventionally written with capital letters. It is often mathematically convenient to express samples as matrices, so that you can do linear algebra operations on observed data (to generate estimates from that data, e.g. with ordinary least squares). The matrix $Y$ would be a matrix of observed values. Take care to observe the context, to avoid this confusion.\n\nTo address your 2nd question, there are many ways to derive or describe a sampling distribution. One possible technique is called *resampling*: repeatedly draw samples from a population that is distributed according to $Y$, and measure the sample mean in each of those samples. The distribution of those sample means should follow the sampling distribution of the mean."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An experiment is conducted to study the effects of four factors (X, Y, Z, W) on a response variable. The researchers perform an ANOVA and obtain the sum of squares (SS) values for main effects and interactions. Which of the following statements is most accurate based on the given information?\n\nA) The factor W has the strongest effect on the response variable because it has the smallest sum of squares value.\n\nB) The three-way interaction X:Y:Z is more important than the two-way interaction X:Y because it has more degrees of freedom.\n\nC) Factors X and Y likely have the strongest main effects on the response variable, as they have the largest sum of squares values among the main effects.\n\nD) The four-way interaction X:Y:Z:W is the most significant term in the model because it accounts for all possible interactions between the factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The sum of squares (SS) column in an ANOVA table indicates the amount of variation explained by each factor or interaction. Larger SS values suggest stronger effects on the response variable. In this case, factors X and Y have the largest SS values among the main effects (2.66 and 2.45 respectively), indicating they likely have the strongest influence on the response variable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a smaller SS value actually indicates a weaker effect, not a stronger one. Option B is wrong because the number of degrees of freedom doesn't determine the importance of an effect; the SS value is more relevant. Option D is incorrect because the four-way interaction has an SS value of 0.00, suggesting it's not significant in this model."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/11/15", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/665269", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/278470/"], "docs_id": 665269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a circle inside an ellipse and am wanting to shade inside the circle (which could be done by drawing a filled circle) and outside the ellipse.\n\nI am using tikz axis package to draw the shapes and was trying to use the shade between package to do the shading.

In order to add a column to the grid you would need to add a field to this table and update the information in that field when an order is created/updated. Below the steps needed to add this to the grid:\n\nI called the extension Example\\_SalesGrid, but you can change it to your own needs.\n\nLet's start by creating the module init xml in **/app/etc/modules/Example\\_SalesGrid.xml**:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n Module bootstrap file\n-->\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <Example_SalesGrid>\n

</modules>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nNext we create our module config xml in **/app/code/community/Example/SalesGrid/etc/config.xml**:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <Example_SalesGrid>\n            <version>0.1.0</version> <!-- define version for sql upgrade -->\n        </Example_SalesGrid>\n    </modules>\n    <global>\n        <models>\n

**/app/code/community/Example/SalesGrid/sql/example\\_salesgrid\\_setup/install\\-0\\.1\\.0\\.php**:\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Setup scripts, add new column and fulfills\n * its values to existing rows\n *\n */\n$this->startSetup();\n// Add column to grid table\n\n$this->getConnection()->addColumn(\n    $this->getTable('sales/order_grid'),\n    'customer_city',\n    'varchar(255) DEFAULT

'customer_city',\n    'customer_city'\n);\n\n// Now you need to fullfill existing rows with data from address table\n\n$select = $this->getConnection()->select();\n$select->join(\n    array('address'=>$this->getTable('sales/order_address')),\n    $this->getConnection()->quoteInto(\n        'address.parent_id = order_grid.entity_id AND address.address_type = ?',\n        Mage_Sales_Model_Quote_Address::TYPE_BILLING\n    ),\n    array('customer_city' => 'city')\n);\n$this->getConnection()->query(\n    $select->crossUpdateFromSelect(\n        array('order_grid' => $this->getTable('sales/order_grid'))\n    )\n);\n\n$this->endSetup();\n\n```\n\nNext we create the layout update file in **/app/design/adminhtml/default/default/layout/example/salesgrid.xml:**\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<layout>\n    <!-- main layout definition that adds the column -->\n

(sales\\_flat\\_order). All fields in sales/order\\_grid matching the column name from sales/order is automatically updated in the sales/order\\_grid table. \n\n**/app/code/community/Example/SalesGrid/Model/Observer.php**:\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Event observer model\n *\n *\n */\nclass Example_SalesGrid_Model_Observer {\n\n    public function addColumnToResource(Varien_Event_Observer $observer) {\n        // Only needed if you use a table other than sales/order (sales_flat_order)\n\n        $resource = $observer->getEvent()->getResource();\n        $resource->addVirtualGridColumn(\n            'customer_city',\n            'sales/order_address',\n            array('billing_address_id' => 'entity_id'),\n            'city'\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code is based on the example from [http://www.ecomdev.org/2010/07/27/adding\\-order\\-attribute\\-to\\-orders\\-grid\\-in\\-magento\\-1\\-4\\-1\\.html](http://www.ecomdev.org/2010/07/27/adding-order-attribute-to-orders-grid-in-magento-1-4-1.html)\n\nHope the example above solves your problem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When adding a new column to the Magento sales/order grid in the backend, which of the following steps is NOT necessary?\n\nA) Creating a module configuration XML file in app/etc/modules/\nB) Adding a new column to the sales_flat_order_grid table via a SQL upgrade script\nC) Modifying the _prepareCollection() method in the grid block class\nD) Creating a layout update XML file to add the column to the grid\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is necessary.

They harm user experience by hiding important navigation elements and SSL indicators, potentially making users suspicious of the site's legitimacy.\n\n3.

pointers?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Large nuclei are unstable for a number of reasons one being that the long range coulomb repulsion force between protons is becoming more \"dominant\", as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, compared with the attractive short range nuclear force between all the nucleons.  \n\nSo large nuclei try and dilute the effect of the coulomb repulsion by adding more neutral neutrons which feel the attractive strong nuclear force but not the coulomb force.  \n\nBut it is a delicate balance and large nuclei want to become more stable by turning into nuclei with smaller numbers of protons within them.  \n\nThe parameter which is useful when comparing the stability of nuclei is the binding energy per nucleon and the largest values of this parameter centre around the nucleus of iron. \n\nSo nuclei much larger than iron are trying to break up into smaller nuclei which are closer in composition to iron nuclei and thus become more stable. \n\nIn the fission process a large unstable nucleus splits up into two more stable nuclei and some neutrons and in the process energy is released and manifests itself as kinetic energy of the fission products \n\nThe masses of the nucleus undergoing fusion is greater than the mass of the fission products and that mass difference is called the mass defect $\\\\Delta m$ and the energy released in the fission process is given by $\\\\Delta m \\\\, c^2$.\n\nSo your statement\n\n> If the mass defect turned into binding energy\n\nis not correct and the energy equivalent of the mass defect is released in the fission process but indeed the resulting nuclei are more stable (have a higher binding energy per nucleon) than the nucleus undergoing fission. \n\n**Update** as a result of a question frpm @B\u00f8bbyLeung \n\n> If the mass defect does not become binding energy, then where would the increase in binding energy of the product nuclei come from (based on the conservation of energy)?\n\nThe binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to break up a nucleus into its constituent parts (individual nucleons). \n\nIn general a smaller nucleus has a smaller binding energy than a larger nucleus because there are more interactions (\"bonds\") between the nucleons but the \"bonds\" between the nucleons in the nuclei around iron are stronger \\- it requires more energy to remove a nucleon from a small nucleus than a large nucleus. \n\nIn terms of numbers let us suppose that you had a nucleus with $120$ nucleons and the binding energy per nucleon was $6$ arbitrary energy units .  \n\nIf this nucleus was assembled from individual nucleons $120 \\\\times 6 \\= 720$ units of energy would have been released.  \n\nSuppose further that for a nucleus with $240$ nucleons the binding energy was $5$ energy units.  \n\nTo assemble such a nucleus from individual nucleons would have released $240 \\\\times 5 \\= 1200$ units of energy. \n\nNow what happens when the nucleus with $240$ nucleons splits into (undergoes fission) two nuclei each with $120$ nucleons. \n\nThe binding energy started at $1200$ and ends up as $2 \\\\times 720 \\= 1440$.  \n\nThis is an **increase** in the binding energy ie it takes more energy to break up two $120$ nucleon nuclei than one $240$ nucleon nucleus. \n\nConservation of energy requires that the fission of a $240$ nucleon nucleus into two $120$ nucleon nuclei must result in the release of $1440 \\- 1200 \\= 240$ units of energy.\n\n> but may I ask if the mass defect isnt transformed into binding energy, then why does the binding energy of the fission product increase (are we getting free binding energy for nothing)? And why can we calculate the energy released in a nuclear reaction by minusing the binding energies of the products by the binding energies of the reactant?\n\nPerhaps your questions are answered in terms of an energy level diagram? \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/alVHj.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/alVHj.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large unstable nucleus undergoes nuclear fission, splitting into two smaller nuclei.

Instead, it is released as energy during the fission process.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the binding energy per nucleon of the product nuclei is actually higher than that of the original nucleus, which is why they are more stable.\n\nOption C is partially correct but incomplete.

Since the dependent voltage source has a voltage given by \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$, we know that the resistance through the dependent voltage source is \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$.

We can then multiply by \\\\$R\\_{TH}\\\\$ to find the Thevenin voltage \\\\$V\\_{TH}\\\\$.\n\nTo do this, I treat the negative port as ground and apply KCL to the current flowing into the \"ground node\".\n\nI need to determine the branch current through \\\\$R\\_2\\\\$ first.

Barring that, the FET as proposed is theoretically workable but raises some concerns (some here, some in comments)\n\nSwitching the FET in and out seems plausible, as long as your control signal can reach to at least the negative rail and past the positive rail. As long as the gate voltage is well above the highest voltage expected on the op amp output, you have a nice comfortable triode operation where the FET is shorted.\n\nHowever, if your output voltage reaches high enough to turn the FET off when it's meant to be on, your gain goes up as the FET resistance increases, so the gain increases and you lose control of your circuit. Even if it doesn't turn completely off, you've added a new behavior into the feedback loop which might lead to instability or poor performance, so it's best to keep the MOSFET firmly in triode with the gate well above the highest voltage you could see.\n\nYou'll also need to keep the body diode of the FET in mind, since you have a discrete FET with source and body bonded together. Because your output stays \\>\\= 0 V, this shouldn't be a major issue, but if you start working with signals that go negative you'll need to revise the design.\n\nI'd budget at least one Vgson drop above the positive rail, which you could probably do with a 5 V square wave and a charge pump circuit consisting of a few diodes and ceramic capacitors. A second FET would then either pull the gate of M1 down or not, while a pullup resistor connects it to the charge pump.\n\nAn alternative approach would be a [transmission gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_gate), if you're able to create two complementary control signals that swing all the way to the positive and negative rails. An integrated transmission gate IC will also avoid the diode issue outlined above.\n\nAs for the PWM idea, I am skeptical of its accuracy but can't conclude that it's a poor idea for certain. Op amps have a limited and not\\-always\\-symmetric slew rate, which could compromise the accuracy of your result, especially as your PWM gets faster. If you do want to explore this further in simulation (rather than experimenting with a prototype) make sure your op amp model adequately models slew rate and other large\\-signal behaviors.\n\nFinally, if a commercial off\\-the\\-shelf variable gain amplifier (either cascaded with your op amp, or replacing it altogether) can meet your specs, that's probably going to be a simpler idea to implement and qualify."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In designing a variable gain amplifier using a MOSFET as a voltage-controlled resistor in the feedback loop of an op-amp, what is the primary concern when setting the gate voltage of the MOSFET?\n\nA) Ensuring the gate voltage is below the negative rail\nB) Keeping the gate voltage equal to the source voltage\nC) Maintaining the gate voltage well above the highest expected output voltage\nD) Setting the gate voltage to exactly match the positive rail voltage\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key concern is maintaining the MOSFET in its triode region for consistent operation. The answer states: \"As long as the gate voltage is well above the highest voltage expected on the op amp output, you have a nice comfortable triode operation where the FET is shorted.\" If the gate voltage is not sufficiently high, the MOSFET could enter saturation or cut-off regions as the output voltage varies, leading to nonlinear behavior and potential instability in the amplifier circuit.

If I'm right, this smearing is necessary to determine the position of a particle in QFT. Why is that necessary? And please, spare my poor soul from a lot a math ;\\-)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fundamental particles in QFT are mathematical points with no size. This leads to so\\-called \"ultraviolet\" (or short\\-distance) divergences (infinities) as the distance between two particles becomes arbitrarily small. The \"smoothing\" procedure is one way to \"regulate\" (or make finite) the divergences by averaging the position of the particle over some small but finite volume. This effectively treats the particle as if it had some size, which mathematically tames the divergences. Of course we are ultimately interested in taking the limit where the size of the particle goes to zero, so smoothing is usually just the first step in a process to understand how to take this limit consistently.\n\nYou may be familiar with the potential of a point charge in electromagnetism\n\\\\begin{equation}\nV(r) \\= k \\\\frac{q}{r}\n\\\\end{equation}\nwhere $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge of the particle, and $r$ is the distance from the particle. As $r\\\\rightarrow 0$, $V\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$. This is an example of an ultraviolet divergence as you get arbitrarily close to a point particle. One manifestation of this divergence is that the *self\\-energy* of the point charge $U \\= \\\\frac{1}{8\\\\pi k}\\\\int d^3 x E^2$ (where $E$ is the electric field) is infinite.\n\nAn example of a \"smoothing\" procedure would be to replace the charged particle with a ball of radius $a$ with the same charge. Then the maximum value of the potential is $V(a) \\= k q / a$; inside the ball, the potential drops smoothly to zero, rather than racing off to infinity. The self energy is finite."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), why is the process of \"smoothing\" or \"smearing\" necessary when dealing with fundamental particles?\n\nA) To increase the mass of particles and make them easier to detect\nB) To eliminate the need for mathematical calculations in QFT\nC) To resolve ultraviolet divergences that occur due to point-like nature of particles\nD) To slow down particles and make their behavior more predictable\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In QFT, fundamental particles are treated as mathematical points with no size. This leads to ultraviolet (short-distance) divergences or infinities as the distance between particles approaches zero. The process of \"smoothing\" or \"smearing\" is used to regulate these divergences by averaging the particle's position over a small but finite volume. This effectively gives the particle a size, which helps to mathematically manage the divergences.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because smoothing doesn't affect the mass of particles. \nAnswer B is wrong as mathematical calculations remain essential in QFT.\nAnswer D is incorrect because smoothing doesn't affect particle velocity or predictability.\n\nThe analogy with electromagnetism helps illustrate this concept. Just as the potential of a point charge goes to infinity as you approach it (r\u21920), similar divergences occur in QFT. Smoothing is like replacing a point charge with a small charged sphere, which keeps the potential finite even at very close distances."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/11", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/299817", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/144668/"], "docs_id": 299817, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been watching some videos on YouTube in order to improve my listening skills.

I saw AC voltage frequency around 0 \u2013 15 Hz (it's way too slow and unhearable). Is that the frequency of the audio signal? Why is it so slow? I thought that audio signals like MP3 music playing comprises of sums of sines and cosines blended perfectly that look like below\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdL4t.jpg)\n\nAlso, why is it that the audio signal doesn't reach 20 Hz \u2013 20kHz which is what I expect to see in the voltmeter. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are feeding hundreds or thousands of different frequencies into a device that is designed to display a single frequency. What do you expect to happen? At best the device will display just one of the many frequencies that are present in the music (and that number will be meaningless in the larger context). At worse, you will confuse the thing and it will give you a completely bogus number.\n\nIf you used an o\\-scope and used the auto\\-measure feature to tell you what the frequency is then you would likely get an equally bogus measurement. The only difference is that with an o\\-scope you could actually see that the number was bogus.\n\nHow do you know that the music does not contain frequencies in the 0\\-15 Hz range? It is entirely possible! Drums will often have some low\\-level noise in that range that is often not audible but is also not often filtered out of the final recording. (Note for the pedantic: frequencies under 10 Hz are often filtered out, but there could easily be stuff in the 10\\-15 Hz range). I also recently worked with a recording studio that had equipment putting noise in the 0\\-5 Hz range into their recordings. \n\nGet an MP3 of a sine wave and redo your measurements using that, not music.

The multimeter is not designed to accurately measure complex audio signals with multiple frequencies. As explained in the documentation, an MP3 music file contains hundreds or thousands of different frequencies blended together. The multimeter, which is designed to display a single frequency, cannot accurately represent this complex signal. It may display just one of the many frequencies present or provide a completely inaccurate reading.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no evidence that the multimeter is faulty. Option B is unlikely, as most music contains a wide range of frequencies. Option D is also incorrect, as the audio jack itself doesn't limit the frequency range of the audio signal.\n\nThe documentation suggests that to properly test the multimeter's frequency measurement capabilities, one should use a simple sine wave of a known frequency rather than complex music.

The 'highly available' part isn't that hard, but the 'with encryption\\-at\\-rest' is proving to be a challenge when used in combination with HA.\n\nThe key problem comes with mounting the encrypted storage. On all of our other encrypted\\-at\\-rest systems there is a command that needs to be run by a human, who is then prompted for the encryption key. This model has a fairly obvious flaw when it comes to a cluster arrangement where services will have to start *automatically*.\n\nI am currently at a loss over how to provide encryption\\-at\\-rest in an HA environment and not also store key passphrases on the same system. \n\nI can see two possible scenarios, either of which will work with my environment but I'm not sure of the details to make them work. Or even if it is possible.\n\nScenario 1: CLVM \\& Cluster\n---------------------------\n\n* A volume is shared between my cluster members.\n* This volume is set up roughly:\n\t+ cryptsetup stuff on the physical device\n\t+ LVM stuff on the new crypt\\-device\n* Cluster Services are set to **not** join the cluster automatically, relying on a manual intervention.\n* Cluster Services are started via command run by a human, which supplies the decryption key, which in turn activates the CLVM stuff.\n\nThis way running nodes have access to the CLVM volume so they can start services when told to by the cluster manager. Reboots of nodes will still require a human, and the crypt passphrase is never kept on disk anywhere.\n\nScenario 2: DRBD \\& Cluster\n---------------------------\n\n* A volume is created on each cluster member\n* cryptsetup stuff is run on the physical device\n* drbd is configured on top of the crypted device, to replicate it between each node\n* LVM or a filesystem is placed on top of the drbd volume\n* Cluster Services are set to **not** join the cluster automatically, relying on a manual intervention.\n* Cluster services are started by a human who provides the decryption key, which in turn makes the LVM (or filesystem) visible\\-but\\-not\\-mounted.\n\nAs with the CLVM setup, nodes don't join the cluster until they have visibility into the presumably\\-shared storage.\n\n---\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure if either of the above work that way. Both assume it's possible to layer an LVM PV on top of an encrypted volume (e.g. `pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptmysql`). This may not be possible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main challenge seems to be the human intervention for key entry. There is some help to that: dm\\-crypt has support for the TPM which might be available with your platform. See [this IBM blueprint](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/lnxinfo/v3r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/liaai/tpm/liaaitpmstart.htm) for configuration details. Also [LUKS/cryptsetup](http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#7._Interoperability_with_other_Disk_Encryption_Tools) supports reading a slot key from file / from stdin. If you can store your key safely somewhere ([like on a smartcard](http://blog.fraggod.net/2010/4/LUKS-dm-crypt-rootfs-without-password-via-smartcard)), this might be a viable option.\n\nAs for your question whether you can have an LVM PV on a dm\\-crypt volume: you can, you just would need a run of `pvscan` / `vgchange -a -y` after slot unlocking. We've run this kind of setup with much older Kernels a couple of years ago. In the end, we've abandoned it in favor of the use of SEDs for applications with data\\-at\\-rest encryption requirements due to performance reasons (dm\\-crypt used to employ a single thread per encrypted device at that time, which led to a CPU bottleneck in our setup)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a highly available MySQL database setup with encryption-at-rest on a Linux kernel, which of the following approaches would best address the challenge of automatic service startup without compromising security by storing encryption keys on the system?\n\nA) Use CLVM with a shared volume, requiring manual intervention and key input for cluster startup\nB) Implement DRBD with encrypted volumes on each cluster node, needing human input for decryption before joining the cluster\nC) Utilize dm-crypt with TPM support to automatically unlock encrypted volumes without human intervention\nD) Store encryption keys in plain text on each cluster node for automatic mounting of encrypted volumes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best approach as it leverages dm-crypt with TPM (Trusted Platform Module) support. This method allows for automatic unlocking of encrypted volumes without requiring human intervention or storing keys insecurely on the system. TPM provides a hardware-based solution for securely storing and using cryptographic keys, addressing the requirement for both high availability and encryption-at-rest without compromising security.\n\nOption A and B, while potentially workable, still require manual intervention for key input, which doesn't fully solve the automatic startup requirement for high availability.\n\nOption D is incorrect and unsafe, as storing encryption keys in plain text on the system would defeat the purpose of encryption-at-rest and pose a significant security risk.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the documentation's mention of TPM support in dm-crypt as a potential solution to the automation challenge, referencing the IBM blueprint for configuration details."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/07/27", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3771333", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/799836/"], "docs_id": 3771333, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Calculate $\\\\displaystyle \\\\int ^{\\\\infty}\\_{0}\\\\frac{x^a}{(x\\+b)^2}\\\\mathrm{d}x$ where $\\|a\\|\\<1$ and $b\\>0$.\n\nWhat I thought is taking almost a sphere without a slice on positive real axis.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $x^a$ has a branch line from $0$ to $\\\\infty$.

Please help me on this. I'm newbie to magento.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is built in to most themes and all of the base themes. So I'm guessing what you want is to **relocate** the related products to another area.\n\nThis is possible in a few different ways:\n\n**Via layouts**\n\nUsing layout XML you can provide the following block declaration to any `<reference>` \\-\n\n```\n<block type=\"catalog/product_list_related\" name=\"catalog.product.related\" before=\"-\" template=\"catalog/product/list/related.phtml\"/>\n\n```\n\nThis should call and render the block and associated template file.\n\n**Roll your own**\n\nWhy not? You're a capable developer! In this case, you can do something very similar to what you posted in the links above. This particular example is fairly trivial but shows you what may be possible:\n\nEdit\n----\n\nMy what a difference a year makes. Don't load models in loops. **Bad Phillip, BAD**.\n\n```\n$related_prods = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')\n                    ->getCollection()\n                    ->addAttributeToSelect('name')\n                    ->addAttributeToSelect('sku')\n                    ->addAttributeToFilter('entity_id',array('in'=>$_product->getRelatedProductIds()));\nforeach($related_prods as $related){\n    echo $related->getName() . \" \" . $related->getSku(); \n}\n\n```\n\nThis can be placed anywhere on the product page or `view.phtml` but **best practice** dictates that you should place this in a Block method and reference that inside the template.

It uses Magento's built-in block type for related products, which is optimized for performance and follows Magento's best practices. This method leverages Magento's layout system, making it easier to maintain and less prone to errors.\n\nOption A is inefficient as it loads each related product individually inside a loop, which can lead to performance issues.\n\nOption C, while better than A, still puts logic in the template file, which goes against Magento's MVC architecture best practices.\n\nOption D, like A, loads products individually in a loop and uses a more complex method to fetch related products, which is unnecessary given Magento's built-in functionality."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/288071", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/185126/"], "docs_id": 288071, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a way to use a loop to create more nested loops?

Recursion is an ideal approach for solving problems with variable nesting levels.

Initially, when the switch is closed and the capacitor is uncharged, it acts as a short circuit. Therefore, the initial current will flow through R1 and the capacitor, bypassing R2.\n\nTo find this current:\n1. Total resistance = R1 = 1k\u03a9\n2. Initial voltage across capacitor = 0V\n3.

Blackadar, [Shape theory for C\\* \\-algebras](http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/math/article/download/12100/10116), Math. Scand. 56 (1985\\), 249\\-275\\.\n\nwhere slightly more general conditions, which can be *imposed* in a natural manner on the generating relations, are considered.

I am quite sure that this is not what you are looking for, though.\n\nWhen the functions allowed in the generating relations are no longer polynomials but arbitrary Borel functions, it is difficult to talk about any kind of universality of such creatures. Indeed, in this case $h(f(a))$ need not be the same as $f(h(a))$ where $h$ is some \\*\\-homomorphism (these are not even well\\-defined *a priori*).\n\nIt is also possible to talk about C\\*\\-algebras generated by order\\-zero c.p.c maps from matrix algebras $M\\_n$ etc (this is perhaps the order ingredient you have in mind).

You can also avoid the creation of your 250mb buffer, by using `uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest` and then create an `NSInputStream` subclass that just keeps providing more data until you tell it to stop. You can implement `URLSession:task:didSendBodyData:totalBytesSent:totalBytesExpectedToSend:` to monitor the progress of your upload (so you can presumably monitor the speed with which data is being sent).\n\nAnyway, to create the upload request:\n\n```\n@interface ViewController () <NSURLSessionDelegate, NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) CustomStream *inputStream;\n\n@end\n\n@implementation ViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    self.inputStream = [[CustomStream alloc] init];\n\n    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:kURLString];\n    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];\n    [request setHTTPMethod:@\"POST\"];\n\n    NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];\n    NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:configuration delegate:self delegateQueue:nil];\n\n    NSURLSessionUploadTask *task = [session uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest:request];\n\n    [task resume];\n\n    // I don't know how you want to finish the upload, but I'm just going \n    // to stop it after 10 seconds\n\n    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(10.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        self.inputStream.finished = YES;\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\nYou obviously have to implement the appropriate delegate methods:\n\n```\n#pragma mark - NSURLSessionTaskDelegate\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task didSendBodyData:(int64_t)bytesSent totalBytesSent:(int64_t)totalBytesSent totalBytesExpectedToSend:(int64_t)totalBytesExpectedToSend\n{\n    NSLog(@\"%lld %lld %lld\", bytesSent, totalBytesSent, totalBytesExpectedToSend);\n}\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task needNewBodyStream:(void (^)(NSInputStream *bodyStream))completionHandler\n{\n    completionHandler(self.inputStream);\n}\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task didCompleteWithError:(NSError *)error\n{\n    NSLog(@\"%s: error = %@;

Any clues and facts are welcomed, best regards !\n\n---\n\nUpdated question: necessary and sufficient conditions for a holomorphic function defined in the unit disk to be univalent (as far as I known, several conditions have be proposed, but all of them seem to be not practical), simple forms and only depend on function g(z) or its derivatives, integrals, their combinations, and so on. For example something like [Milin's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Branges%27s_theorem). Unfortunately, I've tried several variants of this inequality (together with some additional conditons), but fails.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You did not specify in what terms do you need a necessary and sufficient condition.\nPresumably in terms of the coefficients. One such condition can be obtained as follows: $f(z)$ is univalent if and only if\n$$F(z,w)\\=\\\\frac{f(z)\\-f(w)}{z\\-w}$$\nhas no zeros in the unit polydisk, which is equivalent to\n$$\\\\log F(z,w)$$\nto be convergent in the unit polydisk. And for this, there is a formula generalizing the Cauchy Hadamard's formula for the radius of convergence. So this property is (in principle)\nexpressed in terms of the coefficients. Further conditions of this sort can be found in the book of Goluzin, Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable.\n\nAnother criterion of univalence is Milin's criterion, see, for example\n[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10\\.1070/SM1967v003n01ABEH002364](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/SM1967v003n01ABEH002364),\nTheorem 1\\.

Option B is false because while Milin's criterion exists, it is not described as easily applicable in practice for all cases. Option C is incorrect because |b_n| \u2264 n is neither necessary nor sufficient for univalence.
