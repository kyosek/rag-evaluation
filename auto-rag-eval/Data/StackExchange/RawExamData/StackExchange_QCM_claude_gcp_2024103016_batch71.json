If they do not match, they are not allowed into the game.\n\nThis effectively means that if someone wants to join the server as you, they'll also need access to your Microsoft/Mojang account. You should be more worried if you are hacked on an online server than an offline one.\n\nIf you do not have an internet connection, no players will be able to join in online mode.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason to disable it, don't, as it also enables the usage of player skins, and since you are running an SMP, you cannot change your mind easily \\- all inventories and other player data will be lost.\n\nIf you are running a public server, definitely don't.\n\nOffline Mode\n------------\n\nOffline mode does not make a difference in terms of performance, and definitely not a negative one. It actually shaves a few seconds off the login time, but still doesn't effect the overall performance, as this is handled separately.\n\nOffline mode simply disables authentication, meaning that the server does not know if I player is who they say they are.\n\nIn offline mode, any player joining the game is allowed in with whatever name they please. If there is a whitelist, it will still work, but a player can bypass it by changing their name.\n\nHowever, offline mode does have its advantages. If you do not have access to the internet, you can still continue to play on your locally hosted server. If you are messing around with Bukkit plugins while in a car ([but not if you're driving it](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Splash)), or in space (as you often do) this may be useful. Of course, you can use a Wi\\-Fi Hotspot on your phone (unless in space), or just use a single\\-player world.\n\nOffline mode is also useful if you want to be able to use any username. For example, if you are working on a multiplayer Minecraft minigame, it can be useful to test it with multiple players, without buying another account. It can also be used if your friend does not own a Minecraft account, and they want to try the game before buying it. \\*\n\n\\* I'm not encouraging piracy.

The lightgbm documentation explains that the strategy followed is 'Leaf\\-wise (Best\\-first) Tree Growth' as against 'Level wise Tree Growth'. I am unable to understand the difference. In so far as I understand, in a decision tree, at every node, before splitting, information gain that would result from each candidate feature is calculated and that feature is selected for the split at that node which will provide maximum information gain at that node. In this [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lightgbm.pdf) on lightgbm, (Guolin Ke \\& others) mention about Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS). Unfortunately I am unable to understand this also.\nI am familiar with the concept of information gain in measuring impurity but unable to understand what role gradient plays in it and also what is meant by gradient of a data\\-point. Is it possible to help in layman's language.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since a more detailed explanation was asked: \nThere are three reasons why LightGBM is fast:\n\n* Histogram based splitting\n* Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS)\n* Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)\n\n**Histogram based splitting** is in the literature since the late 1990's, but it became popular with Xgboost, that was the first publicly available package to implement it. Since finding the exact optimal split is very costly when there's a lot of data (since it involves testing every possible split point), using a quantile (or histogram) based approximate solution can make the splitting procedure much faster, without losing too much accuracy. This involves computing some optimal weighted quantiles of your feature (i.e. group data into bins), and chose the split points between these quantiles. The algorithm for this procedure can be found in [Xgboost's paper.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf) Xgboost proposed local and global histograms, meaning that they would be computed for every feature either at the beginning of the algorithm (global) or at every new split (local). LightGBM briefly says that it bases its work on histogram based splitting (there are many papers on this), but it does not clarify the way the histogram are computed nor how this is implemented together with GOSS. \n**Gradient\\-based One\\-Side Sampling (GOSS)** is an exclusive feature of LightGBM, and it's some sort of advanced subsampling of the data. Since the computational time for split finding is proportional to the number of features and instances, subsampling the instances makes this problem faster, and this is also the idea behind [Stochastic Gradient Boosting](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf) by Friedman. However, SGB samples the data randomly, often causing a decrease in accuracy of the model. What GOSS does instead is something similar to Adaboost \\- records are weighted by their pseudo\\-residuals \\- since instances with low residuals have little impact on the training as they are already well\\-trained. Therefore, high\\-residuals records are kept while low\\-residuals ones are heavily subsampled, and their weights are recalibrated in order to avoid inserting a bias in the distribution of the residuals. This greatly reduces the number of instances, while maintaining an extremely good performance, and it is one of the reasons why the algorithm is performing better than other histogram based packages such as H2O or XGboost. \n**Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)** is used to deal with sparse features. I will not get into the details at all, mostly because I am not particularly familiar with them; however, suffice to say that EFB is used to bundle sparse features together (features that are never non\\-zero together), in a way that greatly reduces computational effort on big sparse datasets (as mentioned, finding splits is also proportional to the total number of features). The optimal bundling of the sparse features is usually an NP\\-hard problem, but it is solved with good approximation through a greedy algorithm.\n\nIn their documentation they also mention the leaf\\-growth first of the trees. This is not mentioned, as far as I know, in the paper, but it's supposed to be used to increase accuracy and not speed.\n\nSource: [LightGBM paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf) :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about LightGBM is NOT correct?\n\nA) LightGBM uses Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) to subsample instances with high residuals, while heavily subsampling instances with low residuals.\n\nB) Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) in LightGBM is used to bundle dense features together, reducing computational effort on big sparse datasets.\n\nC) Histogram-based splitting in LightGBM involves computing optimal weighted quantiles of features and choosing split points between these quantiles.\n\nD) LightGBM's leaf-wise tree growth strategy is mentioned in the documentation as a method to increase accuracy rather than speed.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: GOSS in LightGBM does indeed subsample instances with high residuals while heavily subsampling those with low residuals.\n\nB is incorrect: EFB is used to bundle sparse features together, not dense features.

If you want longer edges you have to add intermediate points that fall in the places you'd expect.\n\nBut remember, you aren't going to get \"straight lines\" out of this, you're going to get great circles.\n\nIf you want a straight line solution, work in geometry, and recognize that you're going to have to put in your own logic to handle dateline splitting.\n\n(Dateline splitting is not hard to do, *if* your input box is not defined as \"two points\" but rather as a \"lower left point\" and \"upper right point\". Then you can easily test for cases in which the \"lower left\" point appears to be to the right of the \"upper right point\" and say \"aha! this is actually a dateline crossing case!\" and construct two query polygons with the dateline as the bounding edge.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A geographic information systems (GIS) developer is working on a global navigation application.

Great circle routes represent the shortest path between two points on a spherical surface like the Earth. These routes follow the curvature of the Earth and may appear as curved lines on most map projections, including Mercator. \n\nOption A is incorrect because straight lines on a Mercator projection do not represent the shortest path on a spherical surface. \n\nOption B is wrong because the spherical law of cosines actually takes into account Earth's curvature, not ignoring it. \n\nOption D is incorrect because geographic coordinate calculations typically limit edges to 180 degrees or less, choosing the shortest arc of the great circle.

I am wondering if conservation of energy holds beyond that special case; it seems that it should. After all, if a property holds only under special cases then the property is not a law.\n\nReading Feynman's lecture 14 volume I, I understand that if only conservative forces act on an object its total energy remains unchanged. For example, a falling object subject only to gravity has a constant sum of kinetic and potential energies. However, the system consisting of just this object is *not* an isolated system because it is subject to the external force of gravity. It seems this is an instance of conservation of energy holding outside the special case of an isolated system.\n\nFeynman argues that at the fundamental level all forces are in fact conservative. This implies that at the fundamental level conservation of energy applies to all systems. Is this true? If so, why is conservation of energy continually stated under the special case of an isolated system?\n\n(this site's \"energy\\-conservation\" tag says \"the amount of energy in a system is constant\" implying the system need not be isolated, further confusing me)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are different ways of stating conservation of energy and accounting for energy, which can make the issue confusing. One such statement is \"the total energy of an isolated system is constant\". This is true, and is the simplest way to state conservation of energy. This form of conservation of energy is the earliest taught.\n\nThere's another way of stating conservation of energy, \"the energy in a region changes by the amount of energy flowing into or out of a region, and energy in adjacent regions changes by the same amount\". You could call this local conservation of energy, and is a much stronger statement. It not only tells us that energy is conserved, but it also tells us that energy can't disappear from a region and reappear far away.

I want to create a many\\-to\\-many mapping between the fields of schema A and schema B, where schema B uses a subset of the fields from schema A. The ETL is complex and has lots of transformations where information is stored in variables and then transformed in various ways before being output to schema B. Things I have attempted so far:\n\n* Take a piece of data that consists of entirely populated set of schema A with values as \"flags\", run it through the ETL, and analyze the output of schema B for those flags to match. This doesn't take into account transformations of the values, fails on some input constraints and you cannot attach such \"flags\" to the values of boolean or enum fields.\n* Build a Scala compiler plugin that analyzes the AST for usage of types in Schema A and where they go to be inserted into Schema B. This gets me most of the way there, but the approach ends up introducing ambiguities and complexity such as where variables are stored in common functions and re\\-used in different locations and scope in the ETL code.\n* Doing something similar as previous, but in runtime with AspectJ.

Like attaching some sort of flag to the data that will follow it during its transform and output?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I may be coming at this in a manner that is difficult for your situation.\n\nBut I believe you should look at this more as a people and domain understanding problem, and less a technical problem. It sounds like you've been stuck with an ETL project that was written by one, or very few, people who are hard to get access to, and it's now your job to sort it out and take it over.\n\nThe 100% best thing you can do is get access to as many people as you can who had something to do with this project, and fit as much of their time into your discovery period as possible. If you can speak to one of the developers that is the best\\-case scenario.\n\nI can't see why you would expect much success with tinkering with the inputs and running the ETL process like a \"black box.\" Just a few fundamental differences between the two schemas would cause lots of little quirks that would be very difficult to sort out. For the long run you would have much better insight into the execution by studying the structure of the project, its comments, object naming, etc. \n\nSurely you need to study the domain in question first on either the source or destination system, regardless of their schemas. Ask questions to stakeholders that use the systems on either end to get an idea what the source and destination schemas are trying to model. Then compare the table names and try to sort out differences in the models assumptions, using the ETL project along the way to enrich your reasoning.\n\nIn summary, you do not want to come at this as a reverse\\-engineering problem with tracing tools and watching the results of inputs and outputs. You want to come at it as a business problem and involve the stakeholders, to get a good idea of the big picture."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are tasked with understanding and maintaining a complex ETL pipeline in Scala that transforms data from protobuf schema A to protobuf schema B.

This method helps in understanding the underlying logic, assumptions, and transformations in the ETL process, which is essential for accurate mapping and long-term maintenance. Technical approaches like compiler plugins or runtime tracing can introduce ambiguities and may not capture the full complexity of the transformations, especially when dealing with intermediate variables and complex logic.

Look at the package entity framework extended <https://github.com/loresoft/EntityFramework.Extended>. It is as simple as adding method .FromCache () to the query you use to retrieve and filter the data and it will cache the query result. Make sure you load all the data required using includes etc.\n\nYou wouldn't have to worry about same search in model as the caching provider would look at filter settings and determine that it was different. Alternatively cache the data before filtering and then filter the cached results. This is more appropriate if you have lots of filter parameters with significant variance as you will only have to cache 1 large result rather than thousands of smaller results. \n\nYou can get more advanced and specify cache period e.g. Cache for 10 minutes"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on optimizing a search feature in an ASP.NET MVC application that uses Entity Framework for data access.

I am not a physicist.\n\nLet's imagine formation of a black hole from a homogeneous collapsing star. At certain moment when enough of matter is inside of a small enough spherical area the event horizon starts to exist. When does the singularity start to exist and why?\n\nThe matter below the event horizon still continues to collapse towards the centre (e.g. in the reference frame of the falling matter). What are the necessary conditions for the singularity to appear?\n\nI have found two similar questions but the answers did not really explain this problem to me:\n\n* [Do all black holes have a singularity?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/24934/26445)\n* [Event horizons without singularities](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/28834/26445)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you're not up to speed with general relativity this is going to be hard to explain, but I'll give it a go. The more determined reader may want to look at [this PDF (just under 1MB in size)](http://www.aei.mpg.de/~rezzolla/lnotes/mondragone/collapse.pdf) that describes the collapse in a rigorous way.\n\nA couple of points to make before we start: you're being vague about the distinction between the [singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity) and the [event horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon). The singularity is the point at the centre of the black hole where the curvature becomes infinite. The event horizon is the spherical surface that marks the radial distance below which light cannot escape. As you'll see, these form at different times.\n\nThe other point is that to make the calculation possible at all we have to use a simplified model. Specifically we assume the collapsing body is homogeneous (actually I see you anticipated that in your answer) and is made up of *dust*. In general relativity the term *[dust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_solution)* has a specific meaning \\- it means matter that is non\\-interacting (apart from gravity) and has zero pressure. This is obviously very different from the plasma found in real stars.\n\nWith the above simplifications the collapse is described by the [Oppenheimer\\-Snyder model](http://grwiki.physics.ncsu.edu/wiki/Oppenheimer-Snyder_Collapse), and it turns out that the size of the collapsing object is described by the same equation that describes the collapse of a closed universe. This equation is called the [FLRW metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric), and it gives a function called the [scale factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor_(cosmology)), $a(t)$, that describes the size of the ball of dust. For a closed universe the scale factor looks something like:\n\n![Scale factor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QreUD.gif)\n\n(image from [this PDF](http://nicadd.niu.edu/~bterzic/PHYS652/PHYS652_notes.pdf))\n\nA closed universe starts with a Big Bang, expands to a maximum size then recollapses in a [Big Crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch). It's the recollapse, i.e. the right hand side of the graph above, that describes the collapse of the ball of dust.\n\nThe radius of the ball is proportional to $a(t)$, so the radius falls in the same way as $a(t)$ does, and the singularity forms when $a(t) \\= 0$ i.e. when all the matter in the ball has collapsed to zero size.\n\nAs always in GR, we need to be very careful to define what we mean by time. In the graph above the time plotted on the horizontal axis is comoving or proper time. This is the time measured by an observer inside the ball and stationary with respect to the grains of dust around them. It is not the same as the time measured by an observer outside the ball, as we'll see in a bit.\n\nFinally, we should note that the singularity forms at the same time for every comoving observer inside the ball of dust. This is because the ball shrinks in a homogeneous way so the density is the same everywhere inside the ball. The singularity forms when the density rises to infinity (i.e. the ball radius goes to zero), and this happens everywhere inside the ball at the same time.\n\nOK, that describes the formation of the singularity, but what about the event horizon. To find the event horizon we look at the behaviour of outgoing light rays as a function of distance from the centre of the ball. The details are somewhat technical, but when we find a radius inside which the light can't escape that's the position of the event horizon. The details are described in the paper by [Luciano Rezzolla that I linked above](http://www.aei.mpg.de/~rezzolla/lnotes/mondragone/collapse.pdf), and glossing over the gory details the result is:\n\n![Horizon formation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OpOR.gif)\n\nThis shows time on the vertical axis (Once again this is comoving/proper time as discussed above) and the radius of the ball of dust on the horizontal axis. So as time passes we move upwards on the graph and the radius decreases.\n\nIt's obviously harder for light to escape from the centre of the ball than from the surface, so the event horizon forms initially at the centre of the ball then it expands outwards and reaches the surface when the radius of the ball has decreased to:\n\n$$ r \\= \\\\frac{2GM}{c^2} $$\n\nThis distance is called the [Schwarzschild radius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) and it's the event horizon radius for a stationary black hole of mass $M$. So at this moment the ball of dust now looks like a black hole and we can no longer see what's inside it.\n\nHowever note that when the event horizon reaches the Schwarzschild radius the collapse hasn't finished and the singularity hasn't formed. It takes a bit longer for the ball to finish contracting and the singularity to form. The singularity only forms when the red line meets the vertical axis.\n\nFinally, one last note on time.\n\nThroughtout all the above the time I've used is proper time, $\\\\tau$, but you and I watching the collapse from outside measure Schwarzschild coordinate time, $t$, and the two are not the same. In particular our time $t$ goes to infinity as the ball radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius $r \\= 2GM/c^2$. For us the part of the diagram above this point simply doesn't exist because it lies at times greater than infinity. So we never actually see the event horizon form.

However, they are both useful.\n\nIf the base is being substantially current fed, so from a high impedance, then the \u03b2 model is most useful. If we are substantially controlling the base voltage, so driving it with a low impedance, then the diode equation can be easier to use.\n\nWhen we design transistor amplifiers, we need to be able to tolerate the large changes in temperature and \u03b2 that would otherwise upset the bias conditions, so these approximations are quite good enough to tell us whether we have a workable design. Any precision work needs feedback, and that's a different set of equations.\n\nWhen I design a transistor amplifier, I tend to choose the working collector current of each stage, then work backwards with the \u03b2 formula to what base current (to what **range** of base currents) that would require, and then see how much voltage drop is caused in my proposed biassing network or feedback divider by that current. If it's too high, or too variable, then I can reduce the bias impedances, or choose a higher \u03b2 transistor configuration, or otherwise iterate the design to tolerate the range.\n\nI don't find a need to use the base voltage formula. It's not predictive enough to use for setting up bias conditions. When I need to know the response of a transistor to base voltage variations, I use a gm model (basically the differential of that), or better still, S\\-parameters."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student is designing a transistor amplifier and needs to determine the collector current. Which of the following statements best describes the appropriate approach for this situation?\n\nA) Always use the equation Ic = Is * e^(Vbe/Vt) for accurate results in all scenarios.\n\nB) The \u03b2 model (Ic = \u03b2 * Ib) is most useful when the base is being current fed from a high impedance source, while the diode equation is easier to use when controlling the base voltage with a low impedance.\n\nC) For precision work, relying solely on either the \u03b2 model or the diode equation without considering feedback is sufficient.\n\nD) The base voltage formula is highly predictive and should be the primary tool for setting up bias conditions in transistor amplifiers.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. The answer acknowledges that different models are useful in different scenarios, specifically stating that the \u03b2 model is most useful for current-fed bases from high impedance sources, while the diode equation is more suitable when controlling base voltage with low impedance. This aligns with the expert's explanation about choosing models based on the specific circuit configuration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests always using one equation, which contradicts the nuanced approach described in the documentation. Option C is wrong because the documentation explicitly states that precision work needs feedback and different equations. Option D is incorrect because the expert mentions not finding the base voltage formula predictive enough for setting up bias conditions."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/08", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/279151", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/91086/"], "docs_id": 279151, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use a 30W RGB LED that is in common\\-anode configuration.

This allows for proper voltage regulation and current control through high-frequency PWM, protecting the red LED while enabling simultaneous operation and brightness control for all three colors.\n\nThe switching circuit for each LED includes an inductor, diode, and switch (likely a MOSFET), which creates a small buck converter.

Of course, not supported and you should have a backup, so simulate it first with small files on your old pool to see if everything works as expected.\n\n---\n\nFor details see [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993.html) and [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023.html) for details. You can also search online for \"create raidz2 degraded\" if you have other systems like FreeNAS etc.\n\nThe important steps (taken from the mailing list archive thread by Tomas \u00d6gren and Daniel Rock) are:\n\n1. Create sparse file with the size of the real disk (let's assume it is 1000 GB in this example):\n\n```\nmkfile -n 1000g /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n2. Create a zpool with the real disks and the sparse file:\n\n```\nzpool create -f newpool raidz2 disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4 disk5 /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n3. Immediately put the sparse files offline so that nobody tries to write on it:\n\n```\nzpool offline newpool /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n4. Your pool will now be degraded, but functioning. Copy your files to the new pool (use `ssh` or `netcat` between `send` and `recv` if using network instead of directly attached pools):\n\n```\nzfs snapshot -r oldpool@now\nzfs send -R oldpool@now | zfs recv -Fdu newpool\n\n```\n5. Destroy the old one and replace the sparse files with the now freed up disks:\n\n```\nzpool replace newpool /tmp/fakedisk1 disk6\n\n```\n\n---\n\nAgain, a word of caution depending on your redundancy level (if you use two fake disks on a Z2 or three fake disks on a Z3\\):\n\n> Remember: during data migration your are running without safety belts. \n>  If a disk fails during migration you will lose data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are migrating data from an old ZFS pool to a new one with more disks, but you don't have all the physical disks available yet.

This directly increases the maximum PermGen space available to Eclipse, addressing the OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space errors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the -launcher.XXMaxPermSize argument doesn't work for Helios and JDK 1.6.0_21 due to a known bug.\n\nOption C is unnecessary and may introduce compatibility issues with existing projects.\n\nOption D increases the maximum heap size but does not specifically address the PermGen space issue.\n\nThe correct approach is supported by Eclipse documentation and resolves the specific error mentioned in the problem description."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/30", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27420", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/6300/"], "docs_id": 27420, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a simple question about the GARCH model.\n\nWe know that the $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ parameters of the models are fitted for the local volatility of each time $t$ as follows:\n\n$$\\\\sigma\\_t^2\\= \\\\alpha\\_0 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^q \\\\alpha\\_i \\\\varepsilon\\_{t\\-i} \\+ \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^p \\\\beta\\_i \\\\sigma\\_{t\\-i}^2$$\n\nwith $\\\\varepsilon\\_t\\=\\\\sigma\\_t z\\_t$ and $z\\_t \\\\sim N(0,1\\)$\n\nHowever, the wikipedia article says that the process $y$ is behaving as follows:\n\n$$y\\_t\\=a\\_0 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^q a\\_i y\\_{t\\-i} \\+ \\\\varepsilon\\_t$$\n\nI just wanted to make sure that here we assume that $y\\_t$ is the \"original\" time series values, and hence that $\\\\varepsilon\\_t$ was the \"return\" of the time series at time $t$.

To do so, add the following at the very top of your nginx.conf:\n\n```\nload_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\n\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```\nnginx -t\n\n```\n\nIf all is well:\n\n```\nnginx -s reload\nservice nginx restart\n\n```\n\nEdit:\n\n```\n-s signal' Send signal to the master process.

After adding the stream directive to your nginx.conf file, you encounter an \"unknown directive 'stream'\" error. What is the most likely cause and solution for this issue?\n\nA) The stream module is not included in Nginx 1.12.0 and needs to be compiled from source.\n\nB) The stream module is installed but not loaded. Add the line \"load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\" at the top of nginx.conf.\n\nC) The stream module is incompatible with your version of Nginx. Upgrade to a newer version.\n\nD) The stream directive is placed in the wrong location in nginx.conf. Move it inside the http block.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The error message suggests that Nginx doesn't recognize the stream directive, even though Nginx 1.12.0 includes the stream module. The configuration output shows that the stream module was compiled as a dynamic module (--with-stream=dynamic). To use a dynamic module, it must be explicitly loaded in the configuration file. Adding the line \"load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\" at the top of nginx.conf will load the stream module, allowing you to use the stream directive for UDP load balancing. After making this change, you should test the configuration with \"nginx -t\" and then reload Nginx with \"nginx -s reload\" or restart the service."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/02", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/243062", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/113334/"], "docs_id": 243062, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Please consider the situation:\n\nA bread piece has some tiny particles which we see keep on removing off bread, or lying loosely on a surface after we remove it from that surface (These tiny particles are called 'bread crumbs').\n\nSuppose I have to say a sentence for a biscuit piece/bread piece, such as:\n\n\"Don't put these biscuits/cookies/bread pieces directly on bed sheet as it will/it is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.

According to some champion select websites, I am being \"hard countered\", meaning I will have a very hard time in lane.\n\nThe thing is, I don't have any problems whatsoever playing against Teemo (in fact, I do a tiny cheer of joy knowing I can smash that little devil into oblivion). Some might say that a main Teemo player (Satan?) might have an easy time against a Darius since he can outpoke Darius. \n\nNow this would be an endless debate of summoners and skills. I'll keep my question as broad as possible:\n\n**On what basis do these websites state that champion A counters champion B?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **On what facts does countering a champion work?** It seems like this is your question which doesn't make complete sense to me but I'll have a go anyways. One thing you need to keep in mind is that those websites are crowd sourced and so are unreliable. Also, keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other. In low ELO a teemo will likely just try to auto Darius repeatedly taking minion aggro, losing farm, and not try to kite away from his grab. In high ELO Teemo will use bushes to avoid taking aggro and do a lot of hit/run feints so that he doesn't get grabbed easily while poking Darius down and denying him farm.\n\n**keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other.** This statement I made in the last paragraph is the most important. As a Poppy player I'll use her for example. One of my biggest counters is Darius. Why does he counter me? Well Poppy has a passive that reduces burst damage. Darius can bleed Poppy which does low damage and doesn't get reduced by her passive. Darius's ult also ignores Poppy's passive since it does true damage. This means that any trades they make Darius will win out because Poppy's greatest tool for reducing damage is negated. After the trades Poppy can't easily walk away because Darius can grab her and prolong the trade even more. This makes it EXTREMELY dangerous for Poppy to try to farm minion waves at all levels. Another example, Poppy vs Irelia. Irelia counters Poppy because she is more of an AA champion who does true damage and can slow/stun. If Poppy is winning in a trade, Irelia gets a free stun to prolong free damage and has an ability that does true damage. Rumble counters Poppy because she can safely burn Poppy with the low amounts of fire damage which don't get reduced by her passive.\n\nI'll look at another specific counter. Everyone knows that Trundle is a counter to Renekton but if you try to fight Renekton as Trundle early you will lose. Early game is simply about focusing on farming/sustaining as Trundle in this matchup. The reason Trundle counters Renekton is that Trundles ult essentially gets stronger from Renekton's ult. Renekton gets bonus health and Trundle simply steals that bonus health along with armor/MR on top of that. If you are the Renekton player going into this matchup and understand the counter you will realize that the first item you want to rush is a damage item. That's because if you get tanky first you are simply spending gold on stats for trundle to steal.\n\nEssentially, in order to counter Poppy you use a champion who doesn't get reduced damage vs her passive. You can apply this to other champions. If they have a strength that is negated or a weakness they can exploit by picking a champion, it's generally considered a counter in a broad sense. Keep in mind that all counters aren't equal though. You might pick a Riven to counter a Gnar.... but a good Gnar player will understand what makes Riven beat a Gnar in lane and focus on negating that advantage to make the lane more even.\n\nMany people will pick a champion against another simply because they want to **counter** them. The problem with this is that they won't understand what it is about the champion that counters the other champion and the way they play them won't actually be a counter because they don't understand reasoning for the counter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes why champion counters in League of Legends are not always as straightforward as they seem, especially across different skill levels?\n\nA) Counter picks are entirely based on crowd-sourced information and have no factual basis.\n\nB) Lower-skilled players often fail to execute the specific mechanics that make a champion a counter, while higher-skilled players can utilize these mechanics effectively.\n\nC) Counter picks are solely determined by a champion's ultimate ability and how it interacts with the opponent's passive.\n\nD) The effectiveness of a counter pick is primarily dependent on the player's familiarity with their chosen champion, regardless of the matchup.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation emphasizes that counter picks are based on specific mechanics or interactions between champions, which may not be utilized effectively at lower skill levels. For example, it mentions how a low ELO Teemo might not properly kite Darius, while a high ELO Teemo would use bushes and hit-and-run tactics to effectively counter him.

In git you usually never rewrite anything once it is in master: master is the **past** part of the history.

Black holes do not reflect or emit electromagnetic waves (except Hawking radiation which may be too small amount for seeing purpose). The reason for not reflecting and not emitting is that the enormous gravity of the black hole does not let anything including light, escape from it.\n\nHowever if scientists succeed in detecting the gravitational waves, then it will be possible to see some black holes in form of gravitational waves.

Black holes cannot be directly observed using conventional electromagnetic imaging techniques because their immense gravitational pull prevents any electromagnetic waves, including light, from escaping. This means that black holes neither emit nor reflect electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by our current observational methods.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while distance can be a factor in observing celestial objects, it's not the primary reason we can't directly see black holes.\n\nAnswer B is partially true but incomplete. While black holes are effectively invisible, it's not due to their density and size alone, but primarily because of their gravity's effect on electromagnetic waves.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, although black holes do theoretically emit Hawking radiation, this emission is typically too faint to be detected with current technology and is not the main reason for our inability to directly observe black holes.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the fundamental properties of black holes and the limitations of electromagnetic-based observational techniques in astrophysics."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/06/03", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/148256", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/37874/"], "docs_id": 148256, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Yesterday, I began encrypting a 500GB harddisk.

Enabling jumbo frames on the switch and setting a high MTU (around 9000) on both the initiator and target can significantly improve performance. Moving iSCSI traffic to a separate VLAN helps isolate and prioritize this traffic.

So there are $14$ numbers in this set. Divide each one by $13$, and then the remainder modulo $13$ for each number is from $0$ to $12$. Since there are $14$ remainders (from the set S) and only $13$ possible outcomes, therefore there are $2$ numbers for which, the remainder is the same. Then the difference of these two numbers is now divisible by $13$. This difference is of the form $11111\\\\ldots00000$ ($a$ $1\u2019s$ and $b$ $0\u2019s$). That means the number $1111\\\\ldots111$ (with $a$ $1\u2019s$) from this set is divisible by $13$. \n\nThis means there are infinitely many numbers of this form divisible by $13$.

As the final circuit should be as small as possible, my component choices are very limited. \n\nFurthermore, the flyback switch should be driven by a max. voltage of 2V DC. My current problem is now, that there are currently no MOSFET devices available with a Vdss high enough.\n\nMy question now: Are BJTs feasible as a switch (higher breakdown voltage) and if so do they consume any power when turned off? (I am guessing not). Is it possible to drive them from only 2V?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have recently finished a similar design. We are now at the pre\\-production phase, having already validated the first prototypes, which operate perfectly under similar constraints as the ones you describe in your question. Because of IPR limitations, I can only give you some general guidelines.\n\nBased on the following assumptions:\n\n* You are trying to avoid the use of a transformer by all means (which may not be the case),\n* The power requirements of the load is in the miliwatt range,\n* You don't want to step\\-up the voltage supply first, but will use the 2VDC directly for powering your flyback design block.\n* You need to keep the cost and PCB space to the absolute minimum.\n\nI suggest the following approach:\n\n1. Rule out the MOSFET and use a fast switching high voltage BJT (rated at least to 200V, better yet to 300V).\n2. Select the most appropriate inductor for your constraints and depending on your requirements for maximum power delivered to the load.\n3. Calculate the maximum flyback voltage, and make sure you can get at more than 200V voltage flyback \"peaks\". The involved parameters here are: ILpk (inductor peak current), Cts (total sum of parasitic capacitances at the flyback node) and SWITCHING SPEED of the BJT.\n4. The last one is hugely important, and rarely mentioned in the technical literature. You may have a big ILpk and very little Cts, but if your switching (off) speed is not fast enough, the flyback voltage will suffer. Reminder: Vflyback \\= \\-L \\* dI/dt.\n\nThe above can be implemented with:\n\n1. A simple (single) inductor or\n2. A 1:1 coupled inductor.\n\nApparently, from the design equations point of view, there seems to be no need for the 1:1 coupled inductor, as the single inductor will work exactly as well, most probably with less resonance apparatus. However, using a 1:1 coupled inductor will help avoiding EMI generation. I suggest the use the 1:1 coupled inductor in case you have to EMI certify your final product.\n\n\\*\\* However the previous assumptions, should you want to explore the flyback transformer approach, there now exist very nice miniature (micro\\-power) SMD flyback transformers. \\*\\*\n\nFor instance, this Coilcraft model allows up to 1:100 turns ratio with 300Vrms isolation among primary and secondary coils:\n\n[http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235\\.cfm](http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235.cfm)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In designing a flyback circuit to charge a capacitor to 200V from a 1.5V input with size constraints, which combination of components and design considerations would be most appropriate?\n\nA) Use a MOSFET switch, single inductor, and focus mainly on maximizing ILpk (inductor peak current)\n\nB) Use a BJT switch, 1:1 coupled inductor, and prioritize fast switching speed and EMI reduction\n\nC) Use a MOSFET switch, 1:100 turns ratio transformer, and focus on minimizing Cts (total parasitic capacitance)\n\nD) Use a BJT switch, single inductor, and concentrate on maximizing the turns ratio\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The documentation suggests using a BJT instead of a MOSFET due to the high voltage requirement (200V) and the limited 2V drive voltage.\n\n2. A 1:1 coupled inductor is recommended over a single inductor to help avoid EMI generation, which is important if the final product needs EMI certification.\n\n3. The answer emphasizes fast switching speed, which is described as \"hugely important\" in the documentation for achieving the required flyback voltage.\n\n4. While option C mentions a 1:100 turns ratio transformer, which is available, the documentation suggests this only as an alternative to explore, not as the primary recommendation.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because it suggests using a MOSFET, which the documentation explicitly rules out due to voltage limitations.\n\n6.

I am trying to come up with a model to predict power consumption of a machine, using some hardware counters and performance attributes.
