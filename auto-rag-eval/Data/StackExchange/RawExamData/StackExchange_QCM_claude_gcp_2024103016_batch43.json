If I have a logistic regression model that gives the probability a sandwich is more than 12 inches how do I use that probability to estimate how long the sandwich actually is? If the model says the sandwich has a 65\\.5% chance of being more than 12 inches long does that imply a length the sandwich actually is? Perhaps I use the mean and standard deviation of known sandwiches to somehow relate the 65\\.5% probability to actual sandwich length?\n\nPlease help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short answer: you can't.\n\nThe minimum sandwich length is 7\\.86 inches: if your sandwich probability mass is such that the sandwich is of zero length with probability 34\\.5% and length 12 inches with probability 65\\.5%. And note that this already presupposes that there are no sandwiches of negative length, which sounds reasonable for sandwiches, but may not hold in non\\-sandwich applications.\n\nOn the other hand, your sandwich can be of any expected length larger than that, simply by shifting the probability mass of this simple example to the right of 12 inches. Or by assuming pretty much any other distribution.\n\nYou can't even simply assume a normal distribution, because many distributions with different means and standard deviations are consistent with having a 0\\.345 quantile at 12 inches, e.g., a sandwich with mean length 12\\.4 and standard deviation 1, or one with mean 16 and standard deviation 10\\.\n\nSo you will need to add some more knowledge of your problem before you can say anything."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A logistic regression model predicts that a sandwich has a 65.5% probability of being more than 12 inches long. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the estimation of the sandwich's actual length?\n\nA) The sandwich's length can be precisely calculated using only this probability.\nB) The sandwich's length can be estimated accurately by assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 12 inches.\nC) The sandwich's length cannot be determined without additional information about the distribution of sandwich lengths.\nD) The sandwich's length must be exactly 12.4 inches based on the given probability.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the logistic regression model only provides information about the probability of the sandwich being longer than 12 inches, not its actual length. Without additional information about the distribution of sandwich lengths, it's impossible to determine the exact length or even provide a reliable estimate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a single probability value is insufficient to calculate a precise length.\n\nOption B is flawed because assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 12 inches is arbitrary and may not reflect the true distribution of sandwich lengths.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no basis for concluding that the sandwich must be exactly 12.4 inches long. Multiple distributions with different means and standard deviations could result in the same 65.5% probability of being longer than 12 inches.\n\nThe question highlights the limitations of using logistic regression probabilities to estimate continuous values without additional contextual information or assumptions about the underlying distribution."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/31", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/80271", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/29101/"], "docs_id": 80271, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> He told me that he once met an alien from space.

The fact that you get the 554 after the end of DATA suggests that there is something in the content of the message that they don't like, although the server *could* have already decided that it's going to reject your message much earlier than that and has been configured to wait until the end for various reasons (1\\. waste your time/bandwidth/resources, and 2\\. gather as much information about your message as possible).\n\nThe hardest part of these situations is that you're failing policies that are developed and enforced by the receiving end; they might be rejecting your message because the body has the word \"apple\" in it and the last octet of your IP address is a multiple of 3 for all we know.

Sometimes.\n\nHowever, one contributing reason for this particular feature is probably the fact that both *I* and *O* are usually stressed (as one can tell from the fact that they contain diphthongs, which require stress to avoid reduction), while *a* is never stressed and therefore always reduced to /\u0259/."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the capitalization rules for the single-letter words 'I', 'O', and 'a' in English?\n\nA) 'I' and 'O' are capitalized due to their historical origins in the 13th century, while 'a' follows normal capitalization rules because it was introduced later.\n\nB) 'I' and 'O' are always capitalized because they are pronouns, while 'a' is not capitalized because it is an article.\n\nC) 'I' and 'O' are capitalized because they are typically stressed and contain diphthongs, while 'a' is not capitalized because it is unstressed and reduced to /\u0259/.\n\nD) 'I' is capitalized to avoid confusion with the lowercase 'i', 'O' is capitalized for consistency with 'I', and 'a' is not capitalized because it's visually distinct enough.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, a contributing reason for the capitalization of 'I' and 'O' is that they are usually stressed and contain diphthongs, which require stress to avoid reduction. In contrast, 'a' is never stressed and is always reduced to /\u0259/. This phonetic distinction likely influenced the capitalization rules for these single-letter words. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while it mentions a historical aspect for 'I', it doesn't explain 'O' and incorrectly assumes 'a' was introduced later. \n\nOption B is incorrect because 'O' is not a pronoun but an interjection, and the part of speech doesn't fully explain the capitalization rules. \n\nOption D contains a partial truth about 'I' but doesn't accurately explain the capitalization of 'O' and 'a'."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/23", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/176989", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/7575/"], "docs_id": 176989, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wrote a function and I'd like to find out if it is an implementation of some functional programming pattern or construct.

Plausibly other languages to I'm unfamiliar with.\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying>\n\n> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of\n>  transforming a function that takes n multiple arguments (or an n\\-tuple\n>  of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of\n>  functions, each with a single argument (partial application). It was\n>  originated by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel\\[1] and later re\\-discovered by Haskell\n>  Curry.\\[2]\\[3] Because of this, some say it would be more correct to\n>  name it sch\u00f6nfinkeling.\\[4]\\[5]\n\n---\n\nUnnecessary details on currying:\n--------------------------------\n\nAny language with higher order functions can have this behaviour mimicked, generics greatly help it be not clumsy, but the least clumsy languages for this are functional ones with facilities specifically to do it.\n\nThat said here are some articles about doing it in various languages to illustrate as you said it is a pattern:\n\n[http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon\\_skeet/archive/2012/01/30/currying\\-vs\\-partial\\-function\\-application.aspx](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2012/01/30/currying-vs-partial-function-application.aspx)\n\n[http://mtomassoli.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/currying\\-in\\-python/](http://mtomassoli.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/currying-in-python/)\n\n<https://wiki.php.net/rfc/currying>\n\nBy default in haskell, every function takes no more than one value and returns one value, until eventually it takes no values and returns a value.\n\nThis is written as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: inputVal -> (returnVal)\n\n```\n\nThis becomes currying as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: inputVal1 -> (inputVal2 -> (inputVal3 -> (returnVal))))\n\n```\n\nIn this example, someFunc takes a value, and returns (a function which takes a value and returns (a function which takes a value and returns (a value)))).\n\nEach of the functions in that chain take one value, the last return is not a function as it does not take anything but rather holds a computation (perhaps 1\\+2, something that doesn't take parameters).\n\nI say this is default behaviour in Haskell because in Haskell, passing 2 values to someFunc will hand it one value, and hand the next value to the returned function, returning the 3rd function in the chain.\n\ni.e. using the signature above, if I defined someFunc as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc x y z = x + y + z\n\n```\n\nthen I call it as:\n\n```\nplusTwo :: inputVal3 -> (returnVal)\nplusTwo = someFunc 1 1\n\n```\n\nNow I have captured the 2nd returned function in the chain by giving it one parameter which causes it to return the first function, and the second parameter I gave it is curried into that first returned function causing it to be called and return the 3rd function, which I use as the value for `plusTwo`\n\nSo in closing, currying works about like so:\n\ngiven:\n\n```\nsomeFunc a b c d = a + b + c + d\nplusOne   = someFunc 1\nplusTwo   = someFunc 1 1\nplusThree = someFunc 1 1 1\n    four  = someFunc 1 1 1 1\n\n```\n\nThe signatures would be:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: a -> (b -> (c -> (d -> (e))))\n       plusOne :: b -> (c -> (d -> (e)))\n             plusTwo :: c -> (d -> (e))\n                 plusThree :: d -> (e)\n                            four :: e\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the functional programming concept implemented in the given code snippet?\n\nwrap(fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4)\n# returns\npartial(fn4, partial(fn3, partial(fn2, fn1)))\n\nA) Function composition\nB) Currying\nC) Monads\nD) Lazy evaluation\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Function composition is close, but it typically combines functions without partial application.\nB) Currying is the correct answer. The code demonstrates the transformation of a function with multiple arguments into a chain of functions, each taking a single argument.

Does it always mean \"show courage\" or it depends on the region?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the book *[Anesthesia in Cosmetic Surgery](http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511547218&cid=CBO9780511547218A019)*, edited by Barry Friedberg (Publisher: Cambridge University Press):\n\n> Prior to the late 1800s, one could get drunk or literally bite the bullet, neither of which had any effect on pain. An interesting article appeared about a .50 caliber bullet found at the site of the Battle of Ox Hill. The 21st Massachusetts Regiment had fought at a local cornfield with extreme and horrifying injuries. Yet, they had no medical care. The bullet has molar tooth cusp imprints, reportedly from a patient biting during surgery without anesthesia.\n\nAn evidence possibly showing the origin of the phrase is the tooth marks found on a 200\\-year\\-old musket ball on display at *The Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry*:\n\n> ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcuwR.jpg)\n> \n> \n> The bullet on display at the museum was excavated from what is now the Northport section of Baltimore but is believed to have been a field hospital during the War of 1812\\. University of Maryland Dental School pathologist and forensic odontologist Dr. Bernard Levy analyzed the musket ball and verified the impressions are from a human\u2019s dentition.\n> \n> \n> This makes the musket ball a rare find because while many lead musket balls from the Civil War and prior conflicts have been found with teeth marks on them, Dr. Swank said the vast majority have been chewed on by feral hogs who rooted them from the ground. Spotting the difference between a bullet chewed by a hog and one a human chomped on to withstand a painful medical procedure takes some skill, but dental professionals are best equipped to notice.\n> \n> \n> *[http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting\\-bullet](http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting-bullet)*\n\nHere is another evidence, chewed bullets from [the Battle of Antietam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam). These bullets, which Civil War soldiers bit during surgery conducted without anesthesia, are known as *pain bullets* also:\n\n> ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pB2bg.jpg)\n> \n> \n> Archaeologists have determined that these human\\-chewed bullets are most likely from men who perhaps believed it would ease their pain to \"bite the bullet.\"\n> \n> \n> *[http://civilwarstory.nstemp.com/civil\\-war\\-archaeology.html](http://civilwarstory.nstemp.com/civil-war-archaeology.html)*\n\n---\n\nOn the other hand, I found some sources that are against the idea of *pain bullets*. They think that people wouldn't put easily swallowed bullets in their mouth during surgeries and bite marks on the bullets are mostly from animals and especially from hogs.\n\nHere is a plausible explanation from an antique medical, surgical \\& dental artifacts resource site:\n\n> So\\-called medical chewed or pain bullets are mis\\-identified. An easily swallowed bullet is the last thing that one would want to put in the mouth of any anxious patient. To bite the bullet is not a medical phrase, rather it is an old military term referring to loading a muzzleloader. The tip of a preloaded ball and powder paper cartridge was opened with the soldier's teeth, the powder and ball were then poured into the muzzle, the paper cartridge, itself, came next as packing, lastly, all was tamped down with a ram rod. In the heat of battle, it is possible that soldiers may have bitten the paper cartridge at the wrong end (bullet end) and this may have caused some of the marks.\n> \n> \n> *<http://www.antiquescientifica.com/alerts.htm>*\n\n*[Ciwilwarscholars.com](http://civilwarscholars.com/2011/10/myth-no-2-biting-on-the-bullet-for-pain-george-wunderlich/)* and *[civilwarvirtualmuseum.org](http://www.civilwarvirtualmuseum.org/medicine/field-medicine/bitten-bullets.php)* are among the sources that are against the *pain bullet* idea. For example, in one of the sources, it is mentioned that both chloroform and ether were available for administration before surgery. The first method of anesthesia, nitrite oxide, was introduced in 1844; ether as an anesthetic was first used by Horace Wells (an American dentist) in 1846; and the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson first used the anesthetic qualities of chloroform in 1847\\. But there is an evidence that there are chewed bullets with human bite marks that are older than the discovery of anesthesia.\n\nAlthough there are some plausible explanations against the theory, most authoritative sources favor it. So we can conclude that there is strong evidence from authoritative sources that pain bullets were used during surgeries; and it is the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet\".\n\n---\n\nBonus readings:\n\n* *<http://www.pochefamily.org/books/MeltedLead.html>*\n* *<http://www.mytreasurespot.com/main/read.php?5,92836,93227>*\n* *[http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain\\-bullet.25666/](http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain-bullet.25666/)*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the origin and usage of the phrase \"bite the bullet\" is most accurate based on the provided evidence?\n\nA) The phrase originated exclusively from Civil War surgeries and always refers to showing courage in the face of physical pain.\n\nB) The phrase has no connection to actual bullet-biting and instead comes from the process of loading muzzle-loading firearms.\n\nC) The phrase likely originated from medical practices predating anesthesia, but its usage and origin are still debated by historians.\n\nD) The phrase originated from soldiers accidentally biting bullets while preparing cartridges and has no connection to medical practices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The evidence presented shows that there are compelling arguments for the medical origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet,\" including archaeological findings of bullets with human tooth marks from battlefields and field hospitals.

You may well find that some terms can be optimised because they are shared between segments: for example, I've shared `/A`, `/B` etc, but you can find shared terms after the AND gates. (NB: following is for common cathode seven\\-segment display, common anode would be similar but with some logic reversal, as you generate `/outa` etc, not `outa`.) I don't know what gates you consider acceptable, I'm using maximum of 3\\-input ANDs and ORs just because the schematic capture of stackexchange has those.

Because of this, you cannot compute expectation values directly in the limit $\\\\beta\\\\rightarrow 0$. You first need to compute things to lowest order in $\\\\beta$ and then take the limit.

Each $h\\_{iy}$ depends on the height in the first year (which depends on the person $i$) and increases with the years (the rate of increase can also depend on the person $i$), so you have something like $h\\_{iy} \\= \\\\beta\\_{1i} \\+ \\\\beta\\_{2i} y \\+ \\\\epsilon$, where the coefficients $\\\\beta\\_{1i}, \\\\beta\\_{2i}$ depend on the person (hence the subscipt $i$), but **if you can estimate such an equation, then you have one regression line for each person and you can look, for that single person, which points are 'far away' from that individual person's own regression line.** \n\nA reference book is Fitzmaurice, Laird, Ware, \"Applied longitudinal analysis\" where you can find all the details, so I will just explain the main lines of the reasoning:\n\nIt is assumed that the $\\\\beta\\_{1i}$ and $\\\\beta\\_{2i}$ are normally distributed with a mean $\\\\beta\\_1$ (resp. $\\\\beta\\_2$) and a standard deviation $\\\\sigma\\_1$ (resp. $\\\\sigma\\_2$) (so the assumption is that the heights in the first year are normally distributed, just as the growth rates). So we can re\\-write $\\\\beta\\_{ki}$ as $\\\\beta\\_{ki}\\=\\\\beta\\_k \\+ b\\_{kj}$ where $\\\\beta\\_k$ is the mean of all $\\\\beta\\_{ki}$ and $b\\_{ki} \\\\sim N(0;\\\\sigma\\_i), k\\=1,2$. \n\nSo your regression becomes $h\\_{iy}\\=\\\\beta\\_1\\+b\\_{1i} \\+ (\\\\beta\\_2\\+b\\_{2i})y\\+\\\\epsilon$, this is the form that you find in the reference Fitzmaurice et al. \n\nthe $b\\_{ki}$ are called the **random effects**. The $\\\\beta\\_{k}$ are the **fixed effects**. \n\nTo illustrate this let me use some simulated data:\n\n```\n# this is just for simuating data, you have the data, the simulation generates heights\n# for N=500 people for 10 years. \n\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n# simulation for 500 persons\nN<-500\n\n#simulate the heights in the first year, mean 1.7, sd 0.2, \n# generate a random number of each of the N persons\nh0<-rnorm(n=N, mean=1.7, sd=0.2)\n\n#generate a random growth rate for each of the N persons\nch1<-rnorm(n=N, mean=0.01, sd=0.01)\n\n# simulate h_iy:  the height in the first year + (annual growth x year) + error term\nh<-h0 + ch1 %*% t(1:10) + rnorm(n=N, mean=0, sd=0.02)\n\n# reformat it a bit so that it is useable later on\ncolnames(h)<-1:10\ndf<-cbind( data.frame(subject=1:nrow(h)), \n           as.data.frame(h) )\n\ndf.molten<-melt(data=df, id.vars=\"subject\", value.name=\"height\", variable.name=\"year\")\ndf.molten$year<-as.numeric(df.molten$year)\n\n```\n\nAfter simulating the data, we will now estimate the above mentioned equation as a linear mixed effects model (with the nlme package in R):\n\n```\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nlme.h<-lme(height  ~ year + 1,       # we estimate height as function of year\n           data=df.molten,           # on the simulated data\n           random= ~ 1 + year | subject,  # we use a random effect on the intercept and on the coeffcient of year\n           control=lmeControl(opt=\"optim\"),\n           method=\"REML\")\n\n```\n\nThe values that are estimated for your data can be found with the following calls: \n\n```\nlme.fix<-fixed.effects(lme.h)\nlme.blup<-random.effects(lme.h)\n\n```\n\nThe first one gives you the fixed effects $\\\\beta\\_k$ (compare them to the values used in the simulation), the second one gives you the best linear unbiased prediction (blup) of the random effect **for each person of your dataset**. \n\nCompare now the 'estimated fixed effects \\+ the blup predictors of the random effects' for each person to your input (in this case simulated) data, first for the intercept:\n\n```\ndf.plot<-data.frame(sim=h0, estim=lme.blup[[1]]+lme.fix[1])\n\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x=sim,y=estim))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nI can not upload plots from here but if you execute the code then you get a graph with on the horizontal axis the simulated initial (i.e. in the first year) heights and on the vertical axis the estimated/predicted values for each person in the first year, the red line is the bisector. \n\nSimilar, but for the coefficient of the year: \n\n```\ndf.plot<-data.frame(sim=ch1, estim=lme.blup[[2]]+lme.fix[2])\n\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x=sim,y=estim))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nWith these results you have a regression line for each inidivual person, you can also estimate the variance around the line and then find ''outliers'' for each person's line. For details I refer to Fitzmaurice et al. \n\nso for person $i$ you will find the regression line $h\\_{iy}\\=\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_1\\+\\\\hat{b}\\_{1i} \\+ (\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_2\\+\\\\hat{b}\\_{2i})y$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_1$ is in `lme.fix[1]`, $\\\\hat{b}\\_{1i}$ in `lme.blup[[1]][i]` and $\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\_2$ is in `lme.fix[2]`, $\\\\hat{b}\\_{2i}$ in `lme.blup[[2]][i]`\n\nFor the details on the nlme package you can use [this pdf](http://verde.esalq.usp.br/~jorge/cursos/modelos_longitudinais/Mixed%20Effects%20Models%20in%20S%20and%20S-Plus.pdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a longitudinal study of people's heights measured annually for 10 years, you want to identify unusual values within each patient's measurements.

Here's why:\n\n1. It accounts for the longitudinal nature of the data, recognizing that measurements are repeated for each patient over time.\n\n2. Random intercepts allow for different baseline heights for each patient, while random slopes account for individual growth rates.\n\n3. This method creates a personalized regression line for each patient, considering both population-level trends (fixed effects) and individual variations (random effects).\n\n4. Outliers can be identified as measurements that deviate significantly from an individual's expected trajectory, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n5. It's more robust than simple thresholds (A) or z-scores (D), which don't account for expected growth over time.\n\n6.

What's wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This message usually appears when a system uses a certified bus\\-powered USB hub (hub power and power for all it's ports are coming from a single upstream cable from host). In this case the system knows (via hub descriptors) that this is bus\\-powered hub, and therefore it must have the natural limits of how much power can be theoretically taken from upstream, and delivered to downstream ports.\n\nTherefore the bus\\-powered hubs are allowed to allocate only a fraction of power that is normally available from normal ports (500 or 900 mA) and from self\\-powered hubs (powered from external AC\\-DC adapters). To prevent the hub upstream port (host downstream) from overloading, USB has a two\\-step mechanism.\n\nFirst step is an informative. USB devices must take only 100/150 mA from VBUS to respond with device descriptors. The device descriptor(s) have an information on how much current it is expecting to use under full\\-functional mode, its maximum. The system reads this information, and, knowing whether the hub can or can't (theoretically) supply this power, it may or may not proceed with final step of device configuration, SET\\_CONFIG(). If the system determines that the port does have enough power, it finishes the enumeration. If this is a bus\\-powered hub (100 mA per port), and device declares the use of 500 mA, the system won't proceed with configuration and will display the warning message. Thus the device will be rejected. Whether the device really consumes that current remains however unknown.\n\nIn fact, in USB 2\\.0 power management schema of things, the \"high\\-power\" device will not be admitted even if other ports don't have anything plugged in, and theoretically the hub might have enough resource to power it up. This is a major inconvenience from user standpoint. To avoid this inconvenience, USB industry has invented illegal \"semi\\-self\\-powered\" hubs, tyhe hubs who can be bus\\-powered, but don't report this in their descriptors, fooling the host system into thinking that this is a normal self\\-powered hub, so no restrictions will be imposed. The rest is up to user's lack or luck thereof.\n\nSo, it looks like you have a misfortune (or fortune) to have a certified USB hub that plays nicely, in accord with USB specifications. To avoid this messages either use a self\\-powered hub, or use the bootleg hubs that don't report their bus\\-powered status, and pray that the host port has enough power to drive whatever devices you are plugging into the hub without losing much of VBUS voltage level."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for the \"Unknown USB device needs more power than the Port can Supply\" message, and what is a potential solution?\n\nA) The USB device is malfunctioning and drawing too much power.

Replace the USB cable.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The message typically appears when using a certified bus-powered USB hub. These hubs have limited power allocation due to drawing power from a single upstream cable. The system recognizes this limitation and restricts power allocation to downstream ports.

Area 51 additionally displays the number of avid users defined by meeting a certain threshold of reputation on the site. There is also a graph of new users in the moderator tools.\n\nI consider the total number of users, as it is displayed currently, a completely useless statistic. I have no way to determine how many of those users are actually active on the site, I can only see how many people have registered. Many of those might never have come back to the site. The number of new users in the moderator tools is also not very useful, as I have no idea if those new users actually come back to the site and contribute to it.\n\nThe number of avid users on Area 51 is also not a sufficient statistic, as it doesn't tell us if those high reputation users are still contributing to the site. Most users don't rage\\-quit and have their account deleted, they just fade away silently. Most sites likely have some users with a lot of reputation that are not contributing anymore.\n\n**The most important thing I want to see from the user statistics is whether the site is gaining or losing active users.** A site that is steadily gaining users that actively participate in the site, either by contributing posts or maybe just by reading and voting on the content, is a site I would consider healthy (barring any other severe problems). If a site that is hemorrhaging users, if the number of active users is shrinking over time that would be a very clear warning sign that there are severe problems with the site.\n\nIf the user base of a site is shrinking, it would be useful to see this problem as soon as possible to be able to take countermeasures. This is where a better statistic for the number of active users would be very handy. This would be especially important on beta sites, to better gauge the health of the site.\n\nFor this statistic we need to define what constitutes an \"active user\", some ideas would be\n\n* Has visited the site in the last 30 days\n* Has performed at least *x* actions in the last 30 days (actions would be new posts or edits, maybe also voting and commenting)\n* Was active at least once before (to filter out new users, this statistic should show the people who stick around)\n\nI've create [a very basic SEDE query that shows the number of active users (posted at least once in the last 30 days)](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/1779/number-of-active-users-with-1-post-in-last-30-days) and [here is another query from Sklivvz](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/112331/number-of-active-users-with-1-post-in-last-30-days).

Since the \"avid user\" stats on Area51 only look at rep threshold and you get 100/200 points for free for associating an account, sites usually end up with several users with 200\\+ rep (which you can easily get from two questions/answers in a private beta), who have all but stopped participating on the site.\n\nI noticed this trend on [gardening.SE](https://gardening.stackexchange.com/ \"Desperate times call for desperate ways to increase visits\"), where Area51 lists 89 users as \"avid\", but only a handful actively contributed to the site. So I dug up some info using the API (that's the only way to access info for beta sites) and [compiled some stats](https://gardening.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231/folks-we-need-to-grow-got-fertilizers). Only about 2\\.4% (13 users) of the user base (533 users) accounted for more than 1/2, 2/3 and 1/4 of upvotes, answers and questions respectively. Looking at the \"last login\" date on the \"avid users\", I could see that a good number of them hadn't logged in for a while (this info wasn't shared in the meta post).\n\nWhile I was not completely shocked by the results, it certainly was very illuminating and definitely something that would be nice to have in the mod analytics page.

The function maps from the real numbers (\u211d), representing continuous time, to the integers (\u2124), representing discrete events.

I mean, is there a way to add it, that it would look like `20.02.2013`, not smth like `Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2010`. I could make it a simple string, but I need to have the ability to compare dates later (user inserts date, but program shows all rows after it). Right now I have made date like an ordinary double type number and have comparing code like:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(\"Insert date\");\n    double date1 = scan.nextDouble();\n     for (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){\n         if (arr[i][4]!=null) {\n         if((double)arr[i][4]>date1)\n             System.out.println(arr[i][0]);\n     }\n}\n\n```\n\nWorks fine, but would smth like that work for actual dates?  \n\nThanks in advance, I will appreciate any help in solving any of those problems.

Any stream of particles, if not specially prepared, will measure \\+h/2 or \\-h/2 at detector A; they will do with respect to the x axis, or the y axis, or any axis. Exactly the same is true at detector B. How can this very ordinary circumstance illustrate the mystery of entanglement? But that seems to be what David has said: that if you prepare the particles in the entangled state, you get this \"strange result\". I see nothing strange about it since it seems to be exactly the same result if you set up two detectors far apart and measured streams of particles that were totally random.\n\nI am going to suggest that the mystery of entanglement lies in the perfect correlation (or anti\\-correlation) that you get when you set up both detectors along the x axis. Some people think there is nothing mysterious about this because it is exactly what you would expect if the two particles were created with equal and opposite spins. These people are very wrong. The reason they are wrong is that the experiment works the same no matter how you align the detectors with respect to the source of the particles. We can imagine an experiment where particles are created with opposite spins, but assuming the spin axis is random at the moment of creation, there is no way a pair of detectors should show 100% correlation no matter what angle you set it to. In fact, in the case of entanglement, there is 100% correlation regardless of the orientation. That is a real problem and it is really the only problem.\n\nEDIT: I explain this issue in more detail in my blog article, [\"Entanglement and the Crossed Polarizers\"](http://marty-green.blogspot.com/2011/12/entanglement-and-crossed-polarizers.html \"Entanglement and the Crossed Polarizers\")."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the true mystery of quantum entanglement?\n\nA) Entangled particles always measure +h/2 or -h/2 at both detectors, regardless of the axis of measurement.\n\nB) The perfect correlation between entangled particles occurs only when detectors are aligned along the x-axis.\n\nC) Entangled particles exhibit 100% correlation regardless of detector orientation, which cannot be explained by classical models of particles with predetermined opposite spins.\n\nD) The strange result of entanglement is that particles measured at detector A will always have opposite spin to those measured at detector B.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because this behavior is not unique to entangled particles and occurs with any stream of particles.\nB is incorrect because the perfect correlation in entanglement occurs for any alignment of the detectors, not just the x-axis.\nC is correct as it captures the key mystery of entanglement - the perfect correlation regardless of detector orientation, which defies classical explanations.\nD is incorrect as it describes a property of classically correlated particles, not the unique aspect of quantum entanglement."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/26", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6580", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1643/"], "docs_id": 6580, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Question**  \n\nIs there such concept in econometrics/statistics as a derivative of parameter $\\\\hat{b\\_{p}}$ in a linear model with respect to some observation $X\\_{ij}$?  \n\nBy derivative I mean $\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{b\\_{p}}}{\\\\partial X\\_{ij}}$ \\- how would change parameter $\\\\hat{b\\_{p}}$ if we changed $X\\_{ij}$? \n\n**Motivation**  \n\nI was thinking about a situation when we have some uncertainty in data (e.g. results from a survey) and we have enough money to obtain precise results only in a single observation, which observation should we choose?  \n\nMy intuition is saying that we should choose the observation that might change parameters the most, which is equivalent to the highest value of the derivative.

Option D, uniform convergence, is too strong and not typically used in this context for infinite-dimensional spaces.\n\nThe approach of using orthogonal projections (option B) provides a natural way to embed the subspaces into a topological space of operators, allowing for a rigorous analysis of how the subspaces approximate the whole space."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/17", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11520802", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1511579/"], "docs_id": 11520802, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is part of my jquery function that validades a form i have on my website:\n\n```\n        /*\n    validates errors on all the fieldsets\n    records if the Form has errors in $('#formElem').data()\n    */\n    function validateSteps(){\n        var FormErrors = false;\n        for(var i = 1; i < fieldsetCount; ++i){\n            var error = validateStep(i);\n            if(error == -1)\n                FormErrors = true;\n        }\n        $('#formElem').data('errors',FormErrors);   \n    }\n\n    /*\n    validates one fieldset\n    and returns -1 if errors found, or 1 if not\n    */\n    function validateStep(step){\n        if(step == fieldsetCount) return;\n\n        var error = 1;\n        var hasError = false;\n        $('#formElem').children(':nth-child('+ parseInt(step) +')').find(':input:not(button)').each(function(){\n            var $this       = $(this);\n            var valueLength = jQuery.trim($this.val()).length;\n\n            if(valueLength == ''){\n                hasError = true;\n                $this.css('background-color','#FFEDEF');\n            }\n            else\n                $this.css('background-color','#A8FC9C');    /* Campo preenchido */\n        });\n        var $link = $('#navigation_form li:nth-child(' + parseInt(step) + ') a');\n        $link.parent().find('.error,.checked').remove();\n\n        var valclass = 'checked';\n        if(hasError){\n            error = -1;\n            valclass = 'error';\n        }\n        $('<span class=\"'+valclass+'\"></span>').insertAfter($link);\n\n        return error;\n    }\n\n    /*\n    if there are errors don't allow the user to submit\n    */\n\n    $('#enviar_candidatura').bind('click',function(){\n        var preenchimentoForm=true;\n        if($('#formElem').data('errors')){\n            preenchimentoForm=false;\n\n            dadosFormularios(preenchimentoForm);\n            //return false;\n        }\n        else{\n            dadosFormularios(preenchimentoForm);\n        }\n    });\n});\n\n```\n\nHowever, i'm using too LiveValidation (http://livevalidation.com/) to validade fields client\\-side.

It integrates the LiveValidation check at the point of form submission, which is the ideal place to perform this final validation.\n2. It uses the existing 'preenchimentoForm' variable, which is already being used to determine if the form should be submitted.\n3. It checks for the presence of 'LV_invalid_field' class, which is typically added by LiveValidation to fields that fail validation.\n4. This approach doesn't interfere with the existing jQuery validation logic but adds an additional layer of validation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding this check to validateStep() would mix LiveValidation with the existing step-by-step validation, potentially causing confusion.\n\nOption C is a valid approach but less direct than B, as it would require additional modifications to the existing code to be effective.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it would completely replace the existing validation logic, which may be necessary for the multi-step form functionality."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16720538", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1065358/"], "docs_id": 16720538, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a `DateTime` object with value as `2011-08-11T01:03:29+00:00` which is returned from a database.\n\nHow can I convert this to `mm/dd/yyyy` format where as the end result type should be `DateTime` object only, not string?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A `DateTime` object is only the numerical representation of the date as 'ticks' from a constant start time (for example, January 1, 0000\\).

DateTime objects cannot be directly formatted without using ToString() or similar methods.\nB) Incorrect. The internal representation of a DateTime object (as ticks) does not change when formatted differently.\nC) Incorrect. While ToString() is used for formatting, the DateTime object itself remains a DateTime, not a string.\nD) Correct. DateTime objects internally represent time as ticks since a fixed point. The ToString() method is used to format the display of the DateTime, but this doesn't change its internal representation. The format \"MM/dd/yyyy\" can be applied using myDateTime.ToString(\"MM/dd/yyyy\"), but the DateTime object itself remains unchanged."}}
