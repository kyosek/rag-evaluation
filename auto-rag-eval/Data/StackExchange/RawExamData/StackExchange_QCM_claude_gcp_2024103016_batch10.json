When increasing the voltage from 3.3V to 5V, the current through the LED in the photocoupler would increase if the resistor value remained the same. To maintain a similar current (around 8mA) and thus similar performance and longevity of the LED, the resistor should be increased. \n\nThe calculation provided in the documentation shows that for a 5V source, considering the 1.2V drop across the LED, a 470\u03a9 resistor would result in approximately the same current as the original 3.3V circuit with a 255\u03a9 resistor. This modification ensures proper operation at the new voltage while preserving the LED's lifespan.\n\nOption A would result in too much current through the LED.

This sentence isn't grammatically correct, but it might be fine in some styles of colloquial English so I'd parse it to mean, \"I put the socks (that someone wore) out on the table,\" and not, \"I put the worn\\-out socks on the table.\"\n\nThe overarching rule is that an *adjective* (or adjective structure) modifies a noun. So, in your first sentences, since you intend \"worn\\-out\" to modify \"socks\", all the examples are adjectives of one sort or another. In the second example, \"at\\-risk\" modifies \"population\", \"children\", etc. so it's also an adjective.\n\nOf course you can have longer examples of compound adjectives. In the \"Harry Potter\" books and movies various characters famously call Voldemort \"He\\-who\\-must\\-not\\-be\\-named\".

Compound adjectives typically precede the noun they modify, and using hyphens can help clarify the meaning and prevent confusion. This is illustrated in the example of \"worn-out socks,\" where the hyphen helps indicate that \"worn-out\" is modifying \"socks\" as a single descriptive unit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all compound adjectives require hyphens, especially when they follow the noun they modify.\n\nOption B is incorrect because \"He-who-must-not-be-named\" is actually functioning as an adjective clause modifying \"He,\" not as a compound noun.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in the given sentence, \"worn out\" is not correctly positioned as a compound adjective.

In tandem to this, each layer defines a part of the company hierarchy.\n\nE.g. A company decides on three layers. Layer one lists all tasks for a branch in the company, layer two defines the departments and layer 3 closes it off with tasks for employees. Additionally for each branch or department a user needs to be the designated manager, as to allow task creation in the first place.\n\nSo far our software had rudimentary access control in form of a simple flag based check whether the user can read, write, delete or manage Information for the entire account (where users of one company are seated). This is about to change as we now want users to be able to freely delete and write tasks that are assigned to them and to any department/branch/etc they are assigned to.\n\nNow that I am designing the corresponding system I asked myself whether a role based system (rigid Admin/Management/User) would be enough in the long term, as the actual control hinges on where the user is assigned to, not what actions he is allowed to take. Reading is always allowed (except for account data, this is reserved for admins), and a user designated as department\\-manager, will always have full control over its tasks.\n\nMy worry here is, if we decide to expand the program with another module (like project management or inventory forecasting) and then suddenly need finetuning, however my take would be to completely separate access control for these modules and decide what the best approach would be for either of those.\n\nI hope this was clear enough, and would humbly request tips, opinions or approaches.

This model aligns well with the hierarchical nature of the task management system and the need for flexible delegation of authority within the organizational structure. It allows for more granular control based on a user's position and assignments within the company, rather than relying on rigid predefined roles.\n\nOption A (rigid role-based system) is too inflexible for the described needs, as access control depends more on where users are assigned rather than predefined roles.\n\nOption C (simple flag-based system) is the current approach mentioned in the documentation, which is being phased out due to its limitations in handling the complex hierarchical structure and task assignments.\n\nOption D (separate systems for each module) is not ideal as it may lead to inconsistencies and increased complexity in managing access control across different parts of the platform.\n\nThe capability-based model allows for the required flexibility in assigning and managing permissions based on organizational structure and user assignments, making it the best fit for the described system."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/03/06", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/585583", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/448257/"], "docs_id": 585583, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an argument with a couple of friends about the following situation:\n\nI want to meet someone on Monday, in the future, but I can't because I will be out of the country.

By the dominated convergence theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral, resulting in lim_{n\u2192\u221e} \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03c6(y)\u03c8(y/n)dy = \u03c8(0) \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03c6(y)dy = \u03c8(0), since \u222b_{-\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03c6(y)dy = 1.\n\nA is incorrect because delta sequences converge to the Dirac delta distribution in the weak sense, not uniformly.\nC is incorrect because symmetry of \u03c6(x) is not a necessary condition for {\u03c6_n(x)}_{n\u2208\u2115} to be a delta sequence.\nD is incorrect because we can evaluate the limit using the dominated convergence theorem without knowing the specific form of \u03c6(x)."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/04", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/475280", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/125356/"], "docs_id": 475280, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Below I sun \"su\" command on FreeBSD:\n\n```\nFreeBSD rand.vstyle.local 9.0-RELEASE FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE #0 amd64\n\nThis is server RAND :)\n\n[svn@rand ~]$ su logostudiotest1 /bin/ls\nPassword:\n/bin/ls: /bin/ls: cannot execute binary file\n```\n\nWhy \"su\" does not work?!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to the [su manpage](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=su&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+2.2.8-RELEASE&format=html) if you want to run a command as another user using `su`, you should use the `-c` switch. \n\nFor example: `su logostudiotest1 -c /bin/ls`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: On a FreeBSD system, a user attempts to execute the following command:\n\nsu logostudiotest1 /bin/ls\n\nThe command fails with the error message \"/bin/ls: cannot execute binary file\".

Double\\-quoting your strings (including strings with variables) will cause them to be treated as a single token. Otherwise they will be treated as white\\-space delimited lists of tokens. This applies even if the white\\-space occurs after [parameter\\-expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) \\- as is happening in your situation.\n\nFor further discussion on why this is important see the following post:\n\n* [Why does my shell script choke on whitespace or other special characters?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/131766/why-does-my-shell-script-choke-on-whitespace-or-other-special-characters)\n\nHere is what your script should probably look like:\n\n```bsh\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Checking File Copy\"\n\nSRC_DIR=\"/home/user/src\"\n\necho \"Source Directory: ${SRC_DIR}\"\n\nTGT_DIR=\"/media/user/tgt\"\n\necho \"Target Directory: ${TGT_DIR}\"\n\ncd \"${SRC_DIR}\"\n\nfor file_name in *.txt\ndo\n echo \"${file_name}\"\n sum \"${TGT_DIR}/${file_name}\"\n sum \"${file_name}\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nYou'll notice that I've quoted the strings as well as the variables. Strictly speaking this isn't really necessary here, but it's probably good to get in the habit of quoting everything that you want to consider as a single token.\n\nI also used the curly\\-brace syntax for your variables. Again, this probably isn't necessary in this exact situation, but I would consider it a best\\-practice in general. For further discussion regarding the brace syntax see the following post:\n\n* [When do we need curly braces around shell variables?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8748831/when-do-we-need-curly-braces-around-shell-variables)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following modifications to the script would most effectively solve the issue of handling filenames with spaces while also adhering to shell scripting best practices?\n\nA) Replace all instances of $variable with \"${variable}\"\n\nB) Use the escape sequence: tgt_file=${file_name// /\\\\ }\n\nC) Enclose all variable references in single quotes: '$variable'\n\nD) Remove all spaces from filenames before processing: file_name=${file_name// /_}\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is the correct and most comprehensive solution.

First compute the generating function $G(\\\\lambda)\\=\\\\mathbb{E}(e^{i\\\\lambda^TX})$, then set $\\\\lambda\\=au\\+bv$. The result is that we can express the quantities above as derivatives of the generating function:\n\n$$c\\_{p,q}(u,v)\\=(\\-i)^{p\\+q}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p\\+q}}{\\\\partial a^p \\\\partial b^q}G(au\\+bv)\\\\Bigg\\|\\_{a\\=b\\=0}$$\n\nCalculating the generating function is fairly simple for $X$ uniformly distributed on the sphere by performing a rotation so that the vector $\\\\lambda$ is in the $x\\_1$ direction:\n\n$$G(\\\\lambda)\\=\\\\int e^{i\\\\lambda\\\\cdot x}\\\\frac{d\\\\Omega\\_{d\\-1}}{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-1})}\\=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-1})}\\\\int\\_{R^{d}}d^dx \\\\delta(\\|x\\|\\-1\\)e^{i\\\\lambda\\\\cdot x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-1})}\\\\int\\_{R^{d}}d^dx \\\\delta(\\|x\\|\\-1\\)e^{i\\|\\\\lambda\\| x\\_1}$$\n\nReverting back to spherical coordinates\n$$G(\\\\lambda)\\=\\\\int e^{i\\|\\\\lambda\\|\\\\cos\\\\theta}\\\\frac{d\\\\Omega\\_{d\\-1}}{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-1})}\\=\\\\frac{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-2})}{\\\\mu(S\\_{d\\-1})}\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\pi}\\\\sin^{d\\-2}\\\\theta\\~ e^{i\\|\\\\lambda\\|\\\\cos\\\\theta}d\\\\theta$$\nWe recognize the last integral as the Poisson integral for Bessel functions, and hence $G(\\\\lambda)$ can be succinctly written in closed form\n\n$$G(\\\\lambda)\\=2^{d\\-2/2}\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{J\\_{\\\\frac{d\\-2}{2}}(\\|\\\\lambda\\|)}{\\|\\\\lambda\\|^{\\\\frac{d\\-2}{2}}}$$\n\nUsing the series representation of the Bessel function one can show that\n\n$$G(au\\+bv)\\=\\\\sum\\_{n\\=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(\\-1\\)^n \\\\Gamma(d/2\\)}{n!\\\\Gamma(n\\+d/2\\)2^{2n}}(a^2\\|u\\|^2\\+b^2\\|v\\|^2\\+2ab (u\\\\cdot v))^n$$\nWe see immediately that the result is non\\-zero only when $p\\+q$ is even. It is also obvious that the conjecture cannot hold since\n\n$$c\\_{2,2}(u,v)\\\\propto 4(u\\\\cdot v)^2\\+2 \\|u\\|^2 \\|v\\|^2$$\n\nI have not found a satisfactory algebraic formula for arbitrary $p,q$, to be continued!\n\n**EDIT:** I came up with a good way to expand this sum.\n\nObviously when one choose particular values $p\\+q\\=2m$, only the term with $n\\=m$ in the sum will contribute. All we need to do is expand the multivariable polynomial in parentheses above for any value of $n$. The trinomial theorem is not very illuminating so we pick a different route. First rewrite with $z\\=b/a$\n\n$$(a^2u^2\\+b^2v^2\\+2ab(u\\\\cdot v))^m\\=a^{2m}\\|v\\|^{2m}(z\\+\\\\lambda e^{i\\\\theta})^m(z\\+\\\\lambda e^{\\-i\\\\theta})^m$$\n\nwhere $\\\\lambda\\=\\|u\\|/\\|v\\|$, and, $\\|u\\|\\|v\\|\\\\cos\\\\theta\\=u\\\\cdot v$, $\\|u\\|\\|v\\|\\\\sin\\\\theta\\=\\\\sqrt{u^2 v^2\\-(u\\\\cdot v)^2}$\n\nNow we can use the binomial expansion on each of the individual terms\n\n$$(a^2u^2\\+b^2v^2\\+2ab(u\\\\cdot v))^m\\=a^{2m}\\|u\\|^{2m}\\\\sum\\_{kl}{m\\\\choose k}{m\\\\choose l}\\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{k\\+l}(e^{i\\\\theta})^{l\\-k}$$\n\nAll we need to do now is reindex the sum so that everything is written as a coefficient of $z^s$:\n\n$$(a^2u^2\\+b^2v^2\\+2ab(u\\\\cdot v))^m\\=a^{2m}\\|u\\|^{2m}\\\\sum\\_{s\\=0}^{2m}z^s(\\\\lambda e^{i\\\\theta})^{\\-s}\\\\sum\\_{l\\=\\\\max(s\\-m,0\\)}^{\\\\min(s,m)}{m\\\\choose s\\-l}{m\\\\choose l}e^{i2l\\\\theta}$$\n\nOne can explicitly show that this expression is real. We take the real part of the right hand side and since $\\\\cos(n\\\\theta)\\=T\\_n(\\\\cos\\\\theta)$ are the Chebyshev polynomials\n\n$$(a^2u^2\\+b^2v^2\\+2ab(u\\\\cdot v))^m\\=a^{2m}\\|u\\|^{2m}\\\\sum\\_{s\\=0}^{2m}z^s\\\\lambda^{\\-s}\\\\sum\\_{l\\=\\\\max(s\\-m,0\\)}^{\\\\min(s,m)}{m\\\\choose s\\-l}{m\\\\choose l}T\\_{2l\\-s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u\\\\cdot v }{\\|u\\|\\|v\\|}\\\\right)$$\n\nwith the understanding that $T\\_{\\-n}(x)\\=T\\_n(x), n\\>0$. Finally, we conclude that\n\n$$c\\_{2m\\-p,p}(u,v)\\=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(d/2\\)\\\\Gamma(p\\+1\\)\\\\Gamma(2m\\-p\\+1\\)}{2^{2m}\\\\Gamma(m\\+d/2\\)\\\\Gamma(m\\+1\\)}\\|u\\|^{2m\\-p}\\|v\\|^p\\\\sum\\_{l\\=\\\\max(p\\-m,0\\)}^{\\\\min(p,m)}{m\\\\choose p\\-l}{m\\\\choose l}T\\_{2l\\-p}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u\\\\cdot v }{\\|u\\|\\|v\\|}\\\\right)$$\n\nI haven't attempted to try and simplify the Chebyshev polynomials much further. Further simplification occurs when $m\\=p$ but not to the point of a compact expression better than\n\n$$c\\_{p,p}\\=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(d/2\\)\\\\Gamma(p\\+1\\)}{2^{2p}\\\\Gamma(p\\+d/2\\)}\\|u\\|^p \\|v\\|^p\\\\sum\\_{l\\=0}^{p}{p \\\\choose l}^2T\\_{2l\\-p}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u\\\\cdot v }{\\|u\\|\\|v\\|}\\\\right)$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a random vector X uniformly distributed on the unit sphere in R^d, and two fixed vectors u and v in R^d.

The 4\\-divergence\n$$s\\~:\\=\\~d\\_{\\\\mu}J^{\\\\mu}\\\\tag{1}$$\nis then a Lorentz scalar.\n4.

Consider a system with a globally conserved charge Q(t) defined as:\n\nQ(t) = \u222b \u03c1(r,t) d\u00b3r\n\nWhere \u03c1(r,t) is the charge density. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between this global conservation law and the corresponding local conservation law?\n\nA) The global conservation law directly implies the local conservation law without any additional assumptions.\n\nB) The local conservation law \u2202\u03bcJ^\u03bc = 0 can be derived from the global law using only the assumption of Galilean invariance.\n\nC) The local conservation law can be derived from the global law using Lorentz invariance and the assumption of a 4-vector current density J^\u03bc.\n\nD) The global and local conservation laws are independent and cannot be derived from each other under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The derivation of the local conservation law from the global one requires several steps and assumptions:\n\n1. We assume the existence of a 4-vector current density J^\u03bc, with J^0 = \u03c1 being the charge density. This assumption is based on Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2. We define the 4-divergence s = \u2202\u03bcJ^\u03bc, which is a Lorentz scalar.\n\n3. The global conservation law states that dQ/dt = 0.\n\n4. Using Lorentz symmetry, we can show that the Radon transform of s vanishes for any space-like hyperplane.\n\n5. Through the projection-slice theorem and assuming causality for J^\u03bc, we can conclude that s = 0 everywhere, which is the local conservation law.\n\nThis derivation crucially depends on Lorentz invariance and cannot be achieved with Galilean invariance alone (ruling out B). It's not a direct implication without additional assumptions (ruling out A), and the laws are not independent (ruling out D)."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/30", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/221484", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/92353/"], "docs_id": 221484, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When preparing a report for a complex statistical analysis using R markdown, is it okay to encapsulate minor functionality so major functionality stands out more?\n\nCould hiding trivial details cause major interpretation or usage issues?

Or did the pronunciation change over time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can see why you think that it might not be grammatically correct. How can you have an even in the past with a verb (*can*) apparently in the present. Well, you can. The sentence **is** grammatically correct.\n\nThe word *Can* is listed in the *Oxford English Grammar \\[OEG]* as one of many **auxiliaries** (words that help the meaning of some other verb. Some such words can function as verbs in their own right. \n\nFor example, *have* can function as a verb in its own right, as in \"I **have** a book\" (present tense) or \"I **had** a book\" (past tense); or it can function as an auxiliary, as in \"They **have** never seen the Great Wall of China\".\n\nThe word *can* (apart from the misleadingly identically spelled container) only exists as an auxiliary, followed by some verb, and meaning *be able to*. Sidney Greenbaum of OEG lists *can* among a long list of such auxiliaries, such a *ought, may, will, etc..*. In the section on **verb phrases**, he subdivides the *modal auxiliaries* and includes *can* as follows.\n\n> A. **Can/could**\n> \n> \n> **1\\.** **Ability**\n> \n> \n> \\[2] I *can* just about carry it\n> \n> \n> \\[3] I mean obviously I *can* write academic articles\n>  \\[4] *Could* you be a bit more specific about that?\n> \n> \n> **2\\.** **Permission**\n> \n> \n> \\[5] *Can* I borrow yours?  \n> \n>  \\[6] You *can* take these \\- etc\n> \n> \n> **Possibility**\n> \n> \n> \\[8] *Can* this be sent? etc...\n\nLater he continues to another category **(OEG 4\\.24 F: Must, cannot, can't, have to, have got to, need.** This refers to things, for example that **must/have to/have got to** be the case, or which *cannot* be the case, as in your quotation. He gives an example very like yours:\n\n> **1\\. Certainty**\n> \n> \n> \\*\\*\\[53]\\*\\*For a start the patients *cannot* have been brain dead \\<,\\> otherwise they *couldn't* have adapted so well when awakened.\n\nIn other words, \n\n> For a start it is impossible for the patients to have been brain dead, because they adapted too well when awakened **for that to be (medically) possible**.\n\nSo a reason is given for the assertion that the circumstance (that a patient was 'brain dead' but then recovered **cannot have been** the case. \n\nIn your quotation, the journalist does not give give any reason **why** it cannot have been the case. But in the article you link to, it is clear that the situation involved the reason for the referee sending Dembelele of the field with a red card is supposed to be the use of defiant or abusive language. It is also clear that the team manager thought that whatever it was that Dembelele said was very short. One spectator comments that she thought Dembelele said \"muy malo\" (\"very bad\"). If she is right, then the manager was right: Dembelele **didn't** say much, either in length or offensiveness. If not there are plenty of worse things Dembelele could have said in French or, for that matter, Spanish that would have been very offensive indeed. \n\nIn the context of what the commentator wrote, a correct, only slightly different alternative would have been:\\- \n\n> Dembelele *couldn't* have said much to the referee.\n\nYour alternative (\"Dembelele couldn't say much to the referee.\") is correct English, but means something slightly different. That would mean that the player would have been unable to say much the referee, because (for example) his team captain got between them and pushed him back, shouting at him to shut up.\n\n*Cannot* is present, and refers to the (present) **fact that** it cannot (**now**) be the case that Dembelele (**then**) said much.

This aligns with regulations that aim to abolish roaming fees within the EU. The feature gives users more control over their data usage when traveling within the European Union, separate from the general data roaming settings.

Running apt-get update will fix the problem and allow package installation.\n\nC) The VM's network configuration is incorrect, specifically the bridge settings.

The error messages indicate that the VM is trying to connect to 192.168.0.0, which is not a valid IP address for package repositories. The ifconfig output shows that the VM has a 10.0.2.15 IP address, suggesting NAT networking.\n\nThe best solution is to modify the Vagrantfile to properly bridge the network interface. This allows the VM to obtain an IP address on the host's network and have direct access to the internet.

Some ways of teaching least\\-squares regression (e.g, starting from correlations of normally distributed variables) might seem to begin with such an assumption, but there is absolutely no normality assumption about either the predictors or the outcome variables themselves in regression.\n\nYour data are [left censored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)) at an MRD of $10^{\\-5}$. That means the actual MRD is somewhere between 0 and $10^{\\-5}$, but you don't know exactly where. [This answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1795/28500) suggests a simple way to start. Add a separate binary predictor variable indicating whether the MRD value was observed or was set to 0 due to left censoring. For data points set to 0 due to left censoring, re\\-set their MRD values to the lower detection limit of $10^{\\-5}$. You might then transform all the MRD values to $\\\\log\\_{10}(\\\\text{MRD}) \\+5$ so that the left\\-censoring value is transformed to 0 and you get log\\-transformed values above that.\n\nThe regression coefficient for the binary predictor variable gives an overall estimate of the association of \"0 MRD\" in the original scale with outcome. The coefficient(s) for the log\\-transformed data (after resetting the 0 values to $10^{\\-5}$) provide the *extra* association with outcome as MRD values increase above the detection limit.\n\nIt's unlikely that there will be an exactly linear association between the log\\-transformed MRD and outcome. Modeling with a flexible regression spline will let the data tell you the nature of the actual association. With what seem to be many MRD values at or near the left\\-censoring limit, you might want to specify the knots of those regression splines yourself instead of relying on defaults that simply use quantiles of values.\n\nAlso, recognize that the MRD values themselves are subject to substantial measurement error particularly near the left\\-censoring limit. The MRD values in myeloma are typically determined by flow cytometry, with [markers to distinguish normal from abnormal cells](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-021-00328-2). The MRD is the fraction of total cells that are deemed abnormal. If $10^5$ cells are analyzed and none are deemed abnormal, there is still a 5% chance that the actual MRD value [is $3/10^5$ or higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(statistics)). A more sophisticated analysis might incorporate that type of uncertainty into a Bayesian model evaluating survival as a function of measured MRD. That's outside my expertise, but [this page](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/482079/28500) points the way to that type of analysis with left\\-censored predictor values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A hematologist is analyzing MRD (Minimal Residual Disease) data from 360 myeloma patients.

It acknowledges the left-censoring issue at the detection limit of 10^-5.\n2. Creating a binary predictor for censoring allows for estimating the overall effect of having \"0 MRD\" in the original scale.\n3. Setting 0 values to 10^-5 and then applying the log10(MRD)+5 transformation handles the issue of zeros while maintaining the relative scale of the data.\n4. Using regression splines allows for flexible modeling of the potentially non-linear relationship between log-transformed MRD and outcomes.\n5. This approach doesn't force normality on the predictor, which is not a requirement for regression models.\n\nOption A is incorrect because forcing normality on predictors is unnecessary and may distort the data.

Let's take it on the example of **User** object.\n\nOften I see you have `UserEntity` used on the repository level to map to DB entity (sometimes autogenerated by your ORM), that maps to service level `UserDTO`, which then maps to `User` object to be returned by the API or View layer. This also gets more complicated if you plug in different APIs where some people opt\\-in to convert to per API object so `CRMUser`, `ShopUser` and so on.\n\nAll of those have the same (or similar) fields and no functionality.

Why?!??\". Trying to follow the flow of overly abstracted code is really hard.\n\nSo you want *baby bear's* bowl of abstractions: not too few and not too many; just right.\n\nBut what is that \"just right\" level of abstraction? It's basically as few levels of abstraction as possible, without creating either undesirable coupling, or leaky abstractions in the process. There's no fixed number for this as it will vary from app to app. Instead, every time you feel the need to add a new level of abstraction, ask yourself if it's worth it. Will the benefits of decoupling outweigh the disadvantages of complexity? If you feel the answer is \"yes\", then add another level of abstraction and stop doing so the moment the answer is \"no\" and possibly even when it's \"maybe\".

The code provided by me also is not really high\\-performing, because iterating over many tokens of the argument takes place.*\n\nAbout TeX\\-jargon:\n\n* TeX's eyes translate characters to TeX's internal character\\-representation\\-scheme (which with traditional TeX is ASCII (8bit) and with XeTeX/LuaTeX is unicode) and pass them to TeX's mouth where tokenization takes place. The internal character\\-representation\\-scheme can be seen as a function where the characters are the domain and the code\\-point\\-numbers are the range/codomain.  \n\nCategory codes refer to characters before tokenization, not to character\\-tokens. The category\\-code\\-r\u00e9gime can be seen as a function where the characters (determined by their code\\-point\\-number in the TeX\\-engine's internal character\\-representation\\-scheme) are the domain and the category codes are the codomain. Category codes in turn determine the action that shall be triggered when, in the stage of tokenization, a character of the respective category code is encountered.\n* Thus, strictly spoken, character tokens don't have category codes. They have categories. And character codes. \"Category\" and \"character code\" are properties of a specific character token that got inserted into the token\\-stream. The values of these properties are determined in the course of tokenizing in TeX's mouth. During tokenization the category is determined by applying the catcode\\-r\u00e9gime\\-function to the character and \"seeing\" what action the character shall trigger. In many cases the action to be triggered is creating and appending to the token\\-stream a character\\-token of the respective category and with a character\\-code which is determined by applying the internal character\\-representation\\-scheme\\-function to the character. The token\\-stream in turn goes down TeX's gullet where in a process of regurgitation expansion of expandable tokens takes place. After that unexpandable tokens (and expandable tokens whose expansion was suppressed) reach the stomach for further processing, e.g., performing assignments, creating boxes, ... The category of a character token determines the treatment of that character token and the actions it triggers in the stage of expansion and in later stages.\n* There is this \"expansion\\-thingie\" in TeX: Expanding a macro\\-token \"returns\" the macro\\-token's toplevel\\-expansion, not the final result of the expansion\\-cascade.  \n\nThus when describing desired output, please be specific about what you mean by \"return\", i.e., tell\n\t+ whether the result to be \"returned\" is to be a sequence of tokens or to be a page of a .dvi/.pdf\\-output\\-file or to be a message on the terminal or ...\n\t+ in case of wishing to obtain a sequence of tokens: whether expandability is required (and if so: about the amount of expansion\\-steps to be triggered for obtaining the tokens that form the result\u2014with complex macro\\-mechanisms based on `\\romannumeral`\\-expansion you need to trigger at least two expansion\\-steps for obtaining the result) or \"side\\-effects\" like defining temporary macros/scratch\\-macros are allowed.\n\n---\n\nMacro arguments hold explicit character tokens of category 1(begin group) in the same amount as explicit character tokens of category 2(end group).\n\n---\n\n\"Off\\-the\\-cuff\"\\-outline:\n\nBoth the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token and the routine for finding/stringifying the matching explicit category\\-2\\-character\\-token iterate and remove the first component from the argument (which either is an explicit space\\-token of category 10 and character code 32 or is an undelimited argument itself) until either the argument is empty or the argument has a leading explicit character token of category 1\\.\n\nIn case of emptiness the routines are done without returning any tokens as there are no explicit category 1/2 tokens in the argument.\n\nIn case of having reduced the argument to something that has a leading explicit character token of category 1,\n\n* the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token hits that token with `\\string`, then prepends another opening\\-brace and then extracts the first component of the first component of the argument, using an extraction\\-routine which takes explicit space tokens into account.\n* the routine for finding/stringifying the matching explicit category\\-2\\-character\\-token does a loop where both the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token\nand the routine for extracting the first component of the argument, which takes explicit space tokens into account, are used:\n\n\"Lay hands\" on the first component of the argument (which is known not to be a space, but something nested inside a brace\\-group) for checking if that first component is empty.\n\nIf the first component of the argument is empty, there is something like `{}etc etc`. In this case stringify the opening brace, remove it (taking into account that stringification might have yielded a space\\-token), hit the closing brace with `\\string` and extract the first component from the result, using the extraction\\-routine which takes explicit space tokens into account. Terminate, returnig the result of the extraction.\n\nIf the first component of the argument is not empty, there is something like `{<stuff>}etc etc`. In this situation you get four cases by two checks:  \n\nCheck 1: Use the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token for checking if stringification of the argument's first token yields an explicit space\\-token.  \n\nCheck 2: Check if the first component of the argument, which is the content of the brace\\-group `{<stuff>}`, has a leading space.  \n\nDepending on the result of these checks: Stringify the opening brace and remove it either as a space\\-token or as an undelimited argument, then remove the following component either as space\\-token or as undelimited argument and then prepend an opening\\-brace. With the result do the loop again.\n\nHere comes the code. It's a nice `\\expandafter`\\-orgy. I did this off the cuff, fiddling something together quickly. The code can surely be shortened.\n\nThe names of the macros `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified` and `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBracesMatchingClosingBraceStringified` are self\\-explanatory.  \n\nDue to `\\romannumeral`\\-expansion the result is deliverded by triggering two expansion\\-steps on `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified`/`\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBracesMatchingClosingBraceStringified`.  \n\nRunning the code does not require \u03b5\\-TeX\\-extensions or Lua\\-extensions or the like.  \n\nThe implementation does without any `\\if..\\else..\\fi`\\-thingies (except for the \"already\\-defined\"\\-checks before defining macros).  \n\nThere are no \"sentinel\\-tokens\" or the like whose usage in the argument would be forbidden.\n\n```latex\n\\makeatletter\n\\errorcontextlines=10000\n%%=============================================================================\n%% PARAPHERNALIA:\n%% \\UD@firstoftwo, \\UD@secondoftwo, \\UD@PassFirstToSecond, \\UD@Exchange,\n%% \\UD@removespace, \\UD@stopromannumeral, \\UD@CheckWhetherNull,\n%% \\UD@CheckWhetherLeadingExplicitSpace, \\UD@CheckWhetherSpace\n%%=============================================================================\n\\newcommand\\UD@firstoftwo[2]{#1}%\n\\newcommand\\UD@secondoftwo[2]{#2}%\n\\newcommand\\UD@PassFirstToSecond[2]{#2{#1}}%\n\\newcommand\\UD@Exchange[2]{#2#1}%\n\\@ifdefinable\\UD@removespace{\\UD@Exchange{ }{\\def\\UD@removespace}{}}%\n\\@ifdefinable\\UD@stopromannumeral{\\chardef\\UD@stopromannumeral=`\\^^00}%\n%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n%% Check whether argument is empty:\n%%.............................................................................\n%% \\UD@CheckWhetherNull{<Argument which is to be checked>}%\n%%                     {<Tokens to be delivered in case that argument\n%%                       which is to be checked is empty>}%\n%%                     {<Tokens to be delivered in case that argument\n%%                       which is to be checked is not empty>}%\n%%\n%% The gist of this macro comes from Robert R.

`\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified` macro?\n\nA) It returns the first opening brace character in the input, regardless of its category code.\n\nB) It returns the `\\string` representation of the first explicit category-1 character token in the input that is not a control sequence or active character.\n\nC) It always returns an empty result if there are no opening braces in the input.\n\nD) It can only process inputs where all opening braces have category code 1.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption A is incorrect because the macro specifically looks for category-1 tokens, not just any opening brace character.\n\nOption B is correct. The macro searches for the first explicit category-1 character token (opening brace) that is not a control sequence or active character, and returns its `\\string` representation.\n\nOption C is partly true but not entirely correct. While the macro does return an empty result if there are no category-1 tokens, it's not specifically about \"opening braces\" but about category-1 tokens.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The macro can process inputs where opening braces have different category codes. It specifically searches for category-1 tokens, regardless of the visual character used.\n\nThe correct behavior is demonstrated in the example outputs, where the macro correctly identifies and returns the `\\string` representation of the first category-1 token, even when it's not a traditional opening brace character (like in the case where a space is given category code 1)."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/824488", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/119616/"], "docs_id": 824488, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have what I believe is a common Nagios setup: when a host or service has a problem, it sends an email to the on\\-call person and then continues sending emails every hour until the problem is acknowledged or goes away on its own.\n\nI would now like to feed problems (and resolutions, etc.) into a logging system and I don't want to see the hourly \"service is still broken\" messages. I just want to see the initial, \"Service is broken,\" followed (maybe) by, \"Problem is acknowledged\", followed eventually by, \"Service is OK.\" (Specifically, I'm logging to a Slack channel, but I don't think that detail will make a difference to the solution.)\n\nIs there an easy way to set up a \"log\" contact that will get a notification for the first service or host failure, but not the repeating ones?\n\nOne theoretically\\-possible way to do this is through escalations. Here's an example for service notifications:\n\n```\ndefine serviceescalation {\n    host_name            *\n    service_description  *\n\n    contacts  slack\n\n    first_notification  1\n    last_notification   1\n    escalation_options  w,c,u\n}\ndefine serviceescalation {\n    host_name            *\n    service_description  *\n\n    contacts  slack\n\n    first_notification  1\n    last_notification   0\n    escalation_options  r\n}\n\n```\n\nUnfortunately, that only gets warning, critical, unknown, and recovery notifications. I would also like to log flapping and downtime notifications, which don't appear to be passed through the escalation system at all.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You could enable syslog logging in the main config file, and then use a tool like [syslack](https://github.com/lavab/syslack), [log\\-to\\-slack](https://github.com/kokarn/log-to-slack), or similar to send to Slack.\n\nAlso, as you suspected/hinted\\-at, you can do this via host/service escalations applied to hostgroups, servicegroups, and/or using wildcards.\n\nThe [Time\\-Saving Tricks docs page](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/objecttricks.html) shows some ways escalations can be applied broadly.\n\nYou could also write a custom notification script (often the solution for complex notification requirements), or use an [event handler](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/eventhandlers.html) (if you need even more flexibility)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator wants to set up Nagios to send notifications to a Slack channel for service issues, but only wants to receive the initial alert, acknowledgment, and resolution messages without hourly reminders.

As mentioned in the documentation, this method doesn't cover all types of notifications (e.g., flapping and downtime) and may not provide the full flexibility needed.\n\nB) Enabling syslog logging and using a tool like syslack could work, but it might require additional filtering to achieve the specific notification behavior desired. It may not easily distinguish between initial alerts and repeated notifications.\n\nC) This is the most comprehensive solution. A custom notification script can be tailored to handle all types of notifications (including flapping and downtime) and can be programmed to send only the desired messages to Slack, filtering out hourly reminders.\n\nD) While event handlers offer great flexibility, they are typically used for automated actions in response to state changes, not for managing notifications. This approach would be more complex than necessary for the given requirement.\n\nThe custom notification script (option C) provides the most direct and flexible way to achieve the desired notification behavior, covering all types of alerts and allowing precise control over what is sent to Slack."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/07/11", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/370909", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/3993662/"], "docs_id": 370909, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So something seems to be wrong with this one \\- I posted this question: [Strange votes on my account](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/370785/strange-votes-on-my-account) yesterday. As a comment to the answer, one of the moderators recommended to flag the new votes too, which I did accordingly. \n\nAll the flags on serial downvoting got declined, the moderator handling the flags gave following reason:\n\n> declined \\- you only need one flag to explain the downvoting, not one\n>  for every post\n\nFair enough, I've learned to only flag one post the next time \\- it wasn't a problem before, but things may change within 24 hours...\n\nWhat I don't understand is, \n\n1. Why aren't serial downvotes reversed only because I flagged all posts instead of only one? Is this moderator behavior expected on SO?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I declined your flags. I handled all the flags as one flag, as they were all, essentially addressing the same issue, that of serial downvoting.\n\nFirstly, you flagged every post that had been downvoted. It's only necessary to flag one post when you have an account issue. I counted and handled one for the serial downvoting, then counted the other as duplicate flags of the first one. This was made clear in the decline message.\n\n> declined \\- you only need one flag to explain the downvoting, not one for every post\n\nSecondly, no person banned you from flagging, it was an automatic system ban, from having declined flags. and will lift in 6 days from now.\n\nFinally, upon review of the serial downvoting, there was nothing out of order on your account, so the flag was declined. \n\n> declined \\- a moderator reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it\n\nWe cannot stop people from choosing to downvote content, that's how the site works. If there was malicious downvoting, we would have it reversed.

What is the correct approach for flagging suspected serial downvoting, and what outcome can the user expect?\n\nA) Flag every downvoted post individually to ensure all instances are recorded, and expect immediate reversal of downvotes.\n\nB) Flag only one post explaining the serial downvoting issue, and understand that moderators will investigate but may not always find evidence to support the claim.\n\nC) Do not flag at all, as the system will automatically detect and reverse serial downvoting within 24 hours.\n\nD) Flag every downvoted post and repeatedly contact moderators until the votes are reversed, as persistence is key to resolving the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to flag only one post when suspecting serial downvoting, as indicated by the moderator's response: \"you only need one flag to explain the downvoting, not one for every post.\" Flagging multiple posts can lead to declined flags and potential flag bans. Additionally, users should understand that moderators will investigate the claim, but may not always find evidence to support it or reverse votes. The system allows legitimate downvoting, and moderators can only intervene if there's clear evidence of malicious behavior. Users should not expect immediate or guaranteed reversal of downvotes, as the review process is thorough and based on evidence."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/09/13", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24864", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/10954/"], "docs_id": 24864, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Subject sums it up.

Here's why:\n\n1. The first command, `cd ~/Library/Safari/`, changes the directory to where Safari stores its bookmarks.\n2.

The third command, `plutil -convert xml1 Bookmarks.plist.xml`, converts the copied file to XML format.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't preserve the .plist extension in the copied file name, which could lead to issues.\nOption C is incorrect because it looks for the Bookmarks.plist file in the wrong directory (~/Documents/ instead of ~/Library/Safari/).\nOption D is incorrect because it changes to the wrong directory (~/Library/ instead of ~/Library/Safari/) and attempts to convert the original file instead of a copy."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/14", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/119417", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/40167/"], "docs_id": 119417, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is a two part question.\n\nFirstly, I would like to ask which of the following two sentences is the correct construction.\n\n> 1.

The choice between them often depends on the context, formality, and personal preference. The documentation states that there are frequently several grammatical ways to say the same thing in English. It also mentions that \"will\" constructions are more common in serious writing compared to \"be going to\" constructions, but it doesn't specify a preference between \"am\" and \"will be\" in this particular case.

As mentioned in the documentation, going to \"Catalog -> Manage Categories\" in the admin panel and setting \"Include in Navigation Menu = No\" for the subcategories you don't want to display is the appropriate method.

Looking at my rules, I see that when I'm using a \"From\" targeted rule I always use the actual email address, or partial email address, like \"@importantdomain.com.\"\n\nMy suggestion would be to change your last line to a subject rule, so \"Subject does not contain TradingView.\" If that makes the rule work, then there definitely is a problem with the email address in your contact you created for this sender.\n\nAnd not strictly speaking an answer, but I would leave the spam rule for strictly finding spam and then have a separate, higher rule that would look for the \"TradingView\" emails, sort or flag them, then under \"Perform the following actions:\" choose \"Stop evaluating rules.\" That should find the TradingView emails, do what you want with them, then perform no more rule actions on them. A little bit of a different philosophy, but it has worked for me."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A user is having trouble with Apple Mail consistently marking legitimate emails from TradingView as spam, despite taking several steps to prevent this.

Now let's say I want to upgrade to `A-1.0.1.deb`. \n\nAccording to [this document](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html), `dpkg` goes through a pretty involved algorithm to figure which package maintainer scripts are called for each package as part of the upgrade process. If some of these steps fail, then `A` can be left in some sort of limbo state (for example, \"Half\\-installed\"). \n\nHowever, when you break `A`, then `B` is broken too since it depends on `A`. So my question is does `dpkg` have any built\\-in way to deal with this situation? Does `B`'s install status change depending on `A`'s status? Ideally `dpkg` would have some built\\-in functionality to move `B` from the installed state to another state (so that the `B` service can be stopped \\& restarted when `A` is healthy), but I can't find anything in the `dpkg` documentation that suggests this is done.\n\nIf `dpkg` doesn't handle this situation intelligently, does `apt`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From what I have experienced not what i have read.\n\n* > However, when you break A, then B is broken too since A depends on it.

If it was just interrupted, it will fix that and continue working as normal.\n\t2. But it's a problem with control scripts, it will fail again and again and it stay in this loop. Then it's a bug and report would be filled against that package and a manual fix is required.\n* > Does B's install status change depending on A's status?\n\nNo, the status stay as Installed no change, but it does keep track of broken dependency too, at least not in the same file `/var/lib/dpkg/status`.\n* > If dpkg doesn't handle this situation intelligently, does apt?\n\nNo, APT does not interfere in this case. `apt` uses `dpkg`, dpkg is the lower level tool and it is the only tool that actually install, build, remove Debian packages.\n\n---\n\nLet's try it, better it is done in a virtualbox.\n\n1.

It won't complete the upgrade to 1.0.1, nor will it revert cleanly to 1.0.0. Package B's status typically remains unchanged, as dpkg doesn't automatically modify dependent packages' statuses.

E.g. you might estimate the effect of color on sales or something similar.\n\nBut what if some predictors only make sense for some of the product types? Like a \"leg length\" feature might make sense for shorts if people have preference for how far above or below the knee they like their shorts, but not for pants which are always full length. And it may make yet less sense for shirts, since the do not at all have a leg length.\n\nIn that case, is there a way to handle that or is it best to have different models per group? For the features that are shared and are expected to be drawn from the same distribution, I guess we lose some benefit there, so that's why I'm wondering if the models can be done as a single model.\n\nI've thought about a number of things (e.g. for products that don't have the feature, setting it to a constant value, or to a random value drawn from a distribution of feature values from products where the feature does make sense, etc) but all seem to have very obvious problems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's a pretty sensible way of doing this if you centre all your predictors by subtracting the mean value.\n\nUsing your example, say you have athletic shorts, shorts, and jeans, and your numeric predictors are a) brightness (defined for all categories), and b) short length (defined for shorts only, `NA` for trousers). Now, if you centre your both your numeric predictors, you get measures of a) whether the items are darker or lighter than average, and b) whether the shorts are shorter or longer than average. You can safely say that the trousers are $\\\\pm0$ cm shorter or longer than average, and so impute a value of 0 for this predictor for all items that aren't shorts (they're neither shorter nor longer than average). You can then fit a multilevel as you normally would, allowing all predictors to vary across categories:\n\n```\nlmer(sales ~ 1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length + \n             (1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length | category),\n     data=sales_data)\n\n```\n\nSince this predictor only varies for the different kinds of shorts, only sales of those items will have an effect on this parameter. Since it's set to 0 for all other products, this predictor won't affect inferences or predictions about them.\n\nIf it happens that you end up with only one category of shorts in your data,\nif won't be possible to include it as a random effect, and you'll have to change your model accordingly:\n\n```\nlmer(sales ~ 1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length + \n             (1 + centred_colour | category),\n     data=sales_data)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multilevel model for product sales, you want to include a predictor 'leg length' that only applies to shorts, but not to pants or shirts. Which approach is most appropriate for handling this situation while still maintaining a single model for all product types?\n\nA) Set 'leg length' to 0 for all products that aren't shorts, without any centering of the variable.\nB) Randomly assign 'leg length' values drawn from the distribution of shorts' leg lengths to pants and shirts.\nC) Create separate models for each product type to avoid the issue entirely.\nD) Center the 'leg length' predictor by subtracting the mean, then set it to 0 for products that aren't shorts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate approach based on the information provided. By centering the 'leg length' predictor (subtracting the mean), we create a measure of whether shorts are shorter or longer than average. Setting this centered value to 0 for products that aren't shorts effectively means they are neither shorter nor longer than average, which is a logical way to include them in the model without affecting inferences about non-short products.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using raw, uncentered values could skew the model. Option B introduces unnecessary randomness and potential bias. Option C loses the benefits of having a single, unified model for all product types. Option D allows for a single model that can handle predictors specific to certain product types without compromising the analysis of shared predictors across all types."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/25", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/452346", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/87744/"], "docs_id": 452346, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: $3^x \\+ 3^{x\\+2} \\= 5^{2x\\-1}$\n\nPretty lost on this one.

All of them are also DNS servers configured with contoso.com and inside.contoso.com as separate AD integrated zones. Three of the DCs are running Server 2008R2, the other two, Server 2012\\.\n\nNow irritatingly, a folder named \"inside\" keeps appearing in zone contoso.com which contains A records for some or all of the DCs. If I delete all of these records the folder disappears, only to reappear a few minutes later with a single DC's A record, and A records for the other DCs added gradually. It looks as if, when the DCs register themselves in DNS, the entries get added to zone contoso.com instead of inside.contoso.com where they belong.\n\nSimple question: why?\n\nNote 1: All the DCs are also correctly listed as A records in zone intern.contoso.com.

Without this delegation, when a DC tries to register its DNS record ending with .inside.contoso.com, the DNS server doesn't know that inside.contoso.com is a subdomain of contoso.com. As a result, it registers the record in both zones.\n\nCreating a delegation in the contoso.com zone and listing all DCs as delegates will inform the DNS server that inside.contoso.com is indeed a subdomain.

L. Austen in his [How to do Things with Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Austin). To be polite, instead of baldly giving an order, making a request, or asking a question, you mention a normal precondition for performing such a speech act. In your example, there's an added twist that you're depending on a convention of reciprocity in polite conversations that if you make an offer to someone, that person may be obligated to subsequently make a corresponding offer to you, as payback."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which linguistic theory best explains the use of indirect speech acts in polite conversation, as exemplified by the statement \"I was wondering if you could pass the salt\"?\n\nA) Chomsky's Universal Grammar\nB) Saussure's Structuralism\nC) Austin's Speech Act Theory\nD) Grice's Cooperative Principle\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nAustin's Speech Act Theory, as outlined in his work \"How to Do Things with Words,\" best explains the use of indirect speech acts in polite conversation. This theory suggests that instead of making direct requests or giving orders, speakers often mention preconditions for performing such speech acts to maintain politeness. In the example \"I was wondering if you could pass the salt,\" the speaker is indirectly requesting the salt by mentioning their wondering, which is a precondition for making the request.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Chomsky's Universal Grammar focuses on innate linguistic structures rather than pragmatic use of language.\n\nOption B is incorrect as Saussure's Structuralism is primarily concerned with the structure of language systems, not pragmatic usage.\n\nOption D, while related to pragmatics, is not the best fit.

It won't work because those two modules are recursively dependent on each other so I won't be able to instantiate either of them.\n\nI think it is debatable if a `FileSystem` module really needs logging at its core, or if this concern should be solved on a different level, like suggested by Ben Cotrell, but anyway, let us assume your requirement is justified for some reason.\n\nLogs of `FileSystem` calls should be written to a **different file** than the log file used by, for example, an application which instantiates a file logger for a different purpose. So there should be two `FileLogger` objects in this scenario, each one associated with a different *file*. And since each of your `FileSystem` objects holds a reference to a specific file logger, this leads to the need of having **two different file system objects as well**, where the first one is initialized with a null logger and the second one with the logger for file system calls. In pseudo code:\n\n```\n FileSystem nonLoggingFileSystem = new FileSystem(new NullLogger());\n\n FileLogger fileSysCallsLogger(\"file_system_calls.log\", nonLoggingFileSystem);\n\n FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem(fileSysCallsLogger);\n\n FileLogger applicationCallsLogger(`application_calls.log`, fileSystem);\n\n```\n\nNow there is no cyclic dependency between the involved objects, and `fileSystem` as well as `applicationCallsLogger` can be used safely inside the application, without any recursion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a system with a FileSystem module that requires logging and a FileLogger that writes to the file system, how can you resolve the cyclic dependency while maintaining logging functionality for both components?\n\nA) Create a single FileLogger instance that logs both FileSystem and application calls to the same file.\n\nB) Use a ConsoleLogger for the FileSystem module to avoid the cyclic dependency entirely.\n\nC) Initialize two separate FileSystem and FileLogger instances, with the first FileSystem using a NullLogger and the second FileSystem using the FileLogger initialized with the first FileSystem.\n\nD) Eliminate logging from the FileSystem module and only log at the application level.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct solution because it resolves the cyclic dependency while maintaining logging functionality for both the FileSystem and the application. By creating two separate instances of FileSystem and FileLogger, with the first FileSystem using a NullLogger, we break the dependency cycle. This allows the second FileSystem to use a fully functional FileLogger that can log file system calls without causing recursion. This approach ensures that both file system operations and application-level actions can be logged separately and effectively.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a single FileLogger for both purposes would not resolve the cyclic dependency.\nOption B, while avoiding the cyclic dependency, doesn't fulfill the requirement of logging file system operations to a file.\nOption D is not correct as it goes against the stated requirement of logging FileSystem actions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/24", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/285762", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/36656/"], "docs_id": 285762, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently working with matrices.

The nullity of A is 4, not 2. Using the rank-nullity theorem, for a 5x7 matrix, rank(A) + nullity(A) = 7 (number of columns). So, nullity(A) = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\nB) Correct. The rank of a matrix is equal to the dimension of its column space. Since the rank is 3, the column space of A is a 3-dimensional subspace of R^5 (because A has 5 rows, so its columns are in R^5).\n\nC) Incorrect. While there are at least 3 linearly independent rows in A, there could be more. The rank tells us about the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns, not the exact number of non-zero rows.\n\nD) Incorrect. When reduced to row echelon form, A will have exactly 3 non-zero rows, not \"at least\" 3. The number of non-zero rows in the row echelon form is always equal to the rank of the matrix."}}
