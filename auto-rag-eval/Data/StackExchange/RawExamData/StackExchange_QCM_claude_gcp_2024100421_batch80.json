This addresses the root cause of the bottleneck by ensuring that all servers in the infrastructure have consistent and sufficient bandwidth. As suggested in the top answer, putting all servers on the same non-blocking switch with equal bandwidth capabilities would solve the replication problem and eliminate the need for complex, automated replication systems.

Could you give me an example when the expectation exists but is infinite?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [expectation of a random variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#General_definition) $X: \\\\{\\\\Omega, \\\\frak{S}, \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the Lebesgue integral\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}\\[X] \\= \\\\int\\_\\\\Omega X(\\\\omega)d\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\omega).$$\n\nThe Lebesgue integral is [constructed in a sequence of steps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration#Integration) whereby its domain of application is broadened to encompass an ever wider variety of random variables. The first steps ultimately define the integral for variables with non\\-negative values: the complications of integrating functions which might oscillate arbitrarily between negative and positive values are thereby avoided. To extend the integral to variables with negative values, decompose them into their positive and negative parts:\n\n$$X(\\\\omega) \\= X^{\\+}(\\\\omega) \\- X^{\\-}(\\\\omega)$$\n\nwhere $X^{\\+}(\\\\omega) \\= X(\\\\omega)$ when $X(\\\\omega)\\\\ge 0$ and $X^{\\+}(\\\\omega) \\= 0$ otherwise; similarly, $X^{\\-} \\= (\\-X)^{\\+}$. These are readily seen to be random variables, too (that is, they will be measurable). The integral is defined to be the difference\n\n$$\\\\int\\_\\\\Omega X(\\\\omega)d\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\omega) \\= \\\\int\\_\\\\Omega X^{\\+}(\\\\omega)d\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\omega) \\- \\\\int\\_\\\\Omega X^{\\-}(\\\\omega)d\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\omega),$$\n\neach of which involves a non\\-negative random variable and therefore the meaning of its integral has already been defined.\n\n**At this point conventions may vary.** The Wikipedia articles I have linked to declare that the integral is defined only when *both* the positive and negative integrals are finite. One could, however, allow that the integral is also defined when *at most one* of the integrals is finite. We could say that it equals \"$\\+\\\\infty$\" when the integral of the positive part diverges and equals \"$\\-\\\\infty$\" when the integral of the negative part diverges.\n\nIn this extended sense of being defined, consider a random variable $X$ with a **half\\-Cauchy distribution**. Its probability density function (PDF) $f$ is defined and equal to $0$ when $X\\\\lt 0$ and otherwise equal to $(2/\\\\pi)/(1\\+x^2\\)$.

Since an expression like \"$\\\\infty \\- \\\\infty$\" is nonsensical, we have no choice but to declare this expectation *undefined.* One way to convince yourself of this is to consider the various ways in which the integral might be calculated: they concern how the limits of $\\\\pm \\\\infty$ are approached.

The parts between $\\-n$ and $n$ balance, contributing $0$ to the expectation. The value of $f$ is chosen so that the contribution from the excess\\-\\-shown in red\\-\\-is always equal to $\\\\alpha$, no matter what $n$ may be.*\n\nBut a straightforward calculation gives\n\n$$\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int\\_{\\-n}^{f(n)} \\\\frac{x dx}{1\\+x^2} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\log(1\\+x^2\\)\\|\\_{\\-n}^{f(n)} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\log(1\\+f(n)^2\\) \\- \\\\log(1\\+n^2\\)\\\\right)\\=\\\\alpha.$$\n\n(Using the integration endpoints $\\-f(n)$ and $n$ shows that $\\-\\\\alpha$ is a possible value of this limit, too.)

It can be useful to memorize it:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qtS7l.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qtS7l.png)\n\n$$R\\_a\\=\\\\frac{R\\_1R\\_2\\+R\\_2R\\_3\\+R\\_3R\\_1}{R\\_1}$$\n\nEssentially, \\\\$R\\_a\\\\$ is the inverse of the \\\\$R\\_1\\\\$, by a number which depends on the whole setup.\n\nThrough this, and replacing every value with \\\\$r\\\\$, the resistance on the delta branch after the transformation is:\n\n$$ r\\_{aux}\\=\\\\frac{3r^2}{r}\\=3r$$\n\nHence the resistance of every delta branch are the original \\\\$r\\\\$ plus the \\\\$3r\\\\$ in parallel:\n\n$$ r\\_{branch}\\=3r\\|\\|r\\=\\\\frac{3r^2}{3r\\+r}\\=\\\\frac{3}{4}r$$\n\nwhere the operator \\\\$\\|\\|\\\\$ stands for the calculation of the parallel resistance from \\\\$r\\_1\\\\$ and \\\\$r\\_2\\\\$:\n\n$$r\\_1\\|\\|r\\_2\\=\\\\frac{r\\_1r\\_2}{r\\_1\\+r\\_2}$$\n\nSo, the final result is suming two branches in series, plus one branch in parallel:\n\n$$R\\_{AB}\\= (\\\\frac{3}{4}r\\+\\\\frac{3}{4}r)\\|\\|\\\\frac{3}{4}r\\=\\\\frac{3}{2}r\\|\\|\\\\frac{3}{4}r\\=\\\\frac{3}{2}r (1\\|\\|1/2\\)\\=\\\\frac{3}{2}r \\\\frac{1/2}{3/2}$$\n\nFinally:\n$$R\\_{AB}\\= \\\\frac{1}{2}r$$\n\nNote that this requires to leave the C point open\\-circuited. \n\nThis calculation can be also done by converting everything to a delta, which will give a resistance of \\\\$r\\_{aux}\\=\\\\frac{1}{3}r\\\\$ on the converted delta, a sum of \\\\$r\\_{branch}\\=r\\|\\|\\\\frac{1}{3}r\\=\\\\frac{1}{4}r\\\\$ in the new complete branch, and then a final series of only two branches: \\\\$\\\\frac{1}{4}r\\+\\\\frac{1}{4}r\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}r\\\\$, recovering the same result.\n\nEDIT: \nThe suggested method can be applied by supposing a 10A current flowing from A to B \\| or alternatively, by applying a 10V voltage over A and B. [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rYWg.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rYWg.png)\n\nThe variables are \\\\$i\\_1\\\\$,\\\\$i\\_2\\\\$ and\\\\$i\\_3\\\\$. Hence, the four loops voltage equations are:\n$$\nr(i\\_0\\-i\\_1\\)\\=10\\\\\\\\\nr(i\\_1\\-i\\_0\\)\\+r(i\\_1\\-i\\_3\\)\\+r(i\\_1\\-i\\_2\\)\\=0\\\\\\\\\nr(i\\_2\\-i\\_1\\)\\+r(i\\_2\\-i\\_3\\)\\+ri\\_2\\=0\\\\\\\\\nr(i\\_3\\-i\\_1\\)\\+r(i\\_3\\)\\+r(i\\_3\\-i\\_2\\)\\=0\n$$\nwith the matrix form:\n$$\nr\\[1 \\-1 0 0;\\-1 3 \\-1 \\-1; 0 \\-1 3 \\-1; 0 \\-1 \\-1 3]\\[i\\_0;i\\_1;i\\_2;i\\_3]\\=\\[10;0;0;0]\n$$\nWhich leads to the solution:\n$$\ni\\_0\\=\\\\frac{1}{r}20, \ni\\_1\\=\\\\frac{1}{r}10, \ni\\_2\\=\\\\frac{1}{r}5, \ni\\_3\\=\\\\frac{1}{r}5\n$$\nHence we recover our previous results.\n$$R\\_{AB}\\=v\\_0/i\\_0\\=\\\\frac{10}{\\\\frac{20}{r}}\\=\\\\frac{r}{2}$$\n\nFinally, this result is trivial. Once you realize that \\\\$i\\_2\\=i\\_3\\\\$ by symmetry, the node D is equipotential with C, the resistance through the ACB branch is the same than the ADB branch, and twice of the AB branch, and the total resistance is:\n$$r(2\\|\\|2\\|\\|1\\)\\=r(\\\\frac{4}{4}\\|\\|1\\)\\=r(1\\|\\|1\\)\\=\\\\frac{r}{2}$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit consists of six identical resistors of value r arranged in a hexagon shape, with points A and B connected across opposite vertices.

They only need the (log density function of the) prior distribution and the (log\\-)likelihood. The product of these two (or the sum, when working on the log\\-scale) is only proportional to the posterior (we lack a normalizing constant). Being able to work with that may not sound like a huge bit of progress, but actually helps a lot, because we can usually not find the necessary normalizing constant analytically. In contrast, it is often pretty easy to write down the log\\-likelihood and the log density of the prior distribution. That (either conditional on some parameters for Gibbs sampling, or unconditionally for e.g. Metropolis\\-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) is enough to put MCMC samplers to work."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers like JAGS, WinBUGS, Stan, or pymc3, what is the key advantage that allows these tools to generate samples from the posterior distribution without explicitly calculating it?\n\nA) They use a special algorithm to directly compute the normalizing constant of the posterior.\nB) They only require the log-likelihood and log prior density, which are proportional to the posterior.\nC) They approximate the posterior using a series of simplified parametric distributions.\nD) They rely on pre-computed lookup tables of common posterior distributions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. MCMC samplers like JAGS, WinBUGS, Stan, and pymc3 do not need to calculate the full posterior distribution explicitly. Instead, they work with the product (or sum, in log-scale) of the log-likelihood and log prior density, which is proportional to the posterior. This approach sidesteps the need to compute the often intractable normalizing constant of the posterior distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because these methods do not directly compute the normalizing constant, which is usually difficult or impossible to calculate analytically.\n\nOption C is incorrect as MCMC methods do not rely on approximating the posterior with simplified distributions but rather sample from the true posterior (up to a proportionality constant).\n\nOption D is incorrect because MCMC samplers do not use pre-computed lookup tables.

In set theory, a function is often formally defined as a triple (X, Y, F), where X is the domain, Y is the codomain, and F is the set of ordered pairs defining the function. However, when the domain X is a proper class, this triple cannot be formally defined as a set, because proper classes cannot be elements of sets. As triples are typically defined as sets, the standard definition of a function breaks down in this case. This is why functions with proper class domains are often considered to not have a formal codomain in the traditional sense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the size of the domain doesn't necessarily prevent mapping to a codomain.

Also, can you give me a table of the possible processes (ie. adiabatic expansion) and their effect on U and PV? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a system of many particles, we essentially observe the most probable configuration, and relative fluctuations around it are negligible. Here I will prove that the most probable state of a 2\\-particle system is this with equal energies.\n\nThe probability of a state is proportional to the volume of the corresponding part of phase space. If a particle has kinetic energy between $E$ and $E\\+\\\\mathrm dE$, its velocity is between $v$ and $v\\+\\\\mathrm dv$, with $E\\=\\\\frac 12mv^2$ and $\\\\mathrm dE\\=mv\\\\mathrm dv$, that is $\\\\mathrm dv\\=\\\\mathrm dE/\\\\sqrt{2mE}$. The corresponding volume in phase space is $4\u03c0v^2\\\\mathrm dv\u221d\\\\sqrt E\\\\mathrm dE$.\n\nNow for two particles of masses $m$ and $m'$, and of kinetic energies $E$ and $E'$. At ordinary temperatures, collisions are elastic, thus total kinetic energy is conserved: $E\\+E'\\=\\\\text{const.}\\=K$. If the first particle has kinetic energy between $E$ and $E\\+\\\\mathrm dE$, the second one is between $K\\-E$ and $K\\-E\\-\\\\mathrm dE$. The corresponding volume in phase space is thus $\u221d\\\\sqrt E\\\\sqrt{K\\-E}\\\\,(\\\\mathrm dE)^2$. The function $\\\\sqrt{E(K\\-E)}$ is maximum at $E\\=K/2$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a steady flow open system with two particles of equal mass m, the total kinetic energy K is constant. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the most probable state of the system, and why?\n\nA) The particles will have unequal kinetic energies because this maximizes entropy.\n\nB) The particles will have equal kinetic energies (K/2 each) because this corresponds to the largest volume in phase space.\n\nC) The particles will have energies in a ratio of 2:1 because this minimizes total momentum.\n\nD) The distribution of energy between the particles is completely random and unpredictable.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In a system of particles, the most probable state corresponds to the configuration that occupies the largest volume in phase space. For two particles with total kinetic energy K, the phase space volume is proportional to \u221a(E(K-E)), where E is the energy of one particle. This function reaches its maximum when E = K/2, meaning both particles have equal kinetic energies of K/2. This state represents the most probable configuration of the system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because equal energies, not unequal, maximize the phase space volume. Option C has no basis in the given information and incorrectly assumes a connection to momentum. Option D contradicts the statistical mechanical principle that certain states are more probable than others based on phase space considerations."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/03", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20363907", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2640293/"], "docs_id": 20363907, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm writing a code generation tool using VBA in Excel (don't ask why\u2014long story). I need to be able to \"parse\" a flowchart.\n\nThe problem is that Excel allows shapes to contain text, with the exception of connectors: lines and arrows can't contain text. To label an arrow, you just put a text box on top of it\u2014but the box isn't \"attached\" to the arrow in a way that VBA can easily capture.\n\nFor example, a user might draw something like this:\n\n![example flowchart: three boxes, two arrows, two more boxes as arrow labels](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUnGR.gif)\n\nWithin my VBA code, I can use `ActiveSheet.Shapes` to find that the flowchart contains seven shapes: there are five boxes (the two labels are just boxes with no border) and two arrows. Then `Shape.TextFrame2` will tell me what's written inside each box, and `Shape.ConnectorFormat` will tell me which box goes at the start and end of each arrow.\n\nWhat I need is code that can deduce:\n\n* Label A belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 2\n* Label B belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 3\n\nI can think of three ways of doing this, none of them satisfactory.\n\n1. Ask the user to group each label with its corresponding arrow.\n2. Find out the coordinates of the endpoints of each arrow, then\ncalculate which arrows pass through which labels.\n3. Find out the coordinates of the corners of each box, then calculate\nwhich labels lie between which pairs of boxes.\n\nMethod 1 makes things easier for the programmer but harder for the user. It opens up a lot of potential for user error. I don't see this as an acceptable solution.\n\nMethod 2 would be reasonably easy to implement, except that I don't know how to find out the coordinates!\n\nMethod 3 is doable (`Shape.Left` etc will give the coordinates) but computationally quite messy. It also has potential for ambiguity (depending on placement, the same label may be associated with more than one arrow).\n\nNote that methods 2 and 3 both involve trying to match every label with every arrow: the complexity is quadratic. Typical applications will have 10\u201350 arrows, so this approach is feasible, if somewhat inelegant.\n\nDoes anyone have a better idea? Ideally it would be something that doesn't involve coordinate geometry and complicated logic, and doesn't involve asking users to change the way they draw flowcharts.\n\n---\n\nEdited to add: example 2 in response to Tim Williams\n\n![flowchart with one box, two arrows, and a label whose bounding box intersects the bounding boxes of both arrows](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2N5ec.gif)\n\nHere's a label whose bounding box intersects the bounding box of both arrows, and whose midpoint isn't inside the bounding box of either arrow. Visually it's easy for a human to see that it belongs with the left arrow, but programmatically it's hard to deal with. If I can find out the coordinates of the arrows' endpoints, then I can calculate that one arrow passes through the label's box but the other doesn't. But if all I have is the bounding rectangles of the arrows, then it doesn't work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a parameter; although `T` is the most commonly used name, other names would be possible. If one considers a method definition:\n\n```\nSub Foo(Bar As Integer)\n\n```\n\nthe `T` in a type definition plays much the same role as the `Bar` in a method definition. The most notable thing about generic type parameters is unlike parameter definitions which in the sane (`Option Strict Off`) dialect of VB must always specify a type \\[the `As Integer`], generic type parameters can specify a constraint type `Class Foo(Of T As Control)` but are not required to do so.

Which of the following approaches is the most correct and complete way to accomplish this?\n\nA) Add a new column definition in the _prepareColumns() method of the grid block class, using 'index' => 'category_ids'.\n\nB) Create a custom renderer class that extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid_Column_Renderer_Abstract and implement the render() method to fetch and display category names.\n\nC) Modify the _prepareCollection() method of the grid block to join the category table and add category names to the collection.\n\nD) Create a full module with an observer, custom renderer, system config source, and XML configurations to properly integrate the new column into the existing admin product grid.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nWhile options A, B, and C each address part of the solution, they are incomplete or may not integrate well with Magento's architecture.\n\nOption A is a simple approach but doesn't handle the complexity of multiple categories per product or provide filtering capabilities.\n\nOption B creates a renderer, which is part of the solution, but doesn't address how to add the column to the grid or handle filtering.\n\nOption C modifies the collection, which could work for simple cases but may not be efficient for products with multiple categories and doesn't provide a clean way to filter or sort.\n\nOption D is the most complete and Magento-friendly approach. It creates a full module that:\n1. Uses an observer to add the column to the existing product grid without modifying core files.\n2. Implements a custom renderer to properly display multiple categories.\n3. Provides a system config source for category options in filtering.\n4. Uses proper XML configurations to integrate with Magento's module system.\n5. Allows for easy maintenance and upgrades.\n\nThis approach follows Magento best practices and provides a robust, scalable solution for adding the category column to the admin product grid."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/20", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/534982", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/286144/"], "docs_id": 534982, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *The laws in our country that restrict our **freedoms** are not legislated by evil politicians.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Plural *freedoms* is fine. \n\nCompare this usage:\n\n> *The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition*.\n> \n> \n> Source: [Legal Information\n>  Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"freedoms\" in English is most accurate?\n\nA) The word \"freedoms\" is always grammatically incorrect and should be replaced with \"freedom\" in all contexts.\n\nB) \"Freedoms\" is only acceptable when referring to specific legal rights, such as those outlined in the First Amendment.\n\nC) The plural form \"freedoms\" can be used to emphasize multiple distinct types or aspects of liberty, both in legal and general contexts.\n\nD) \"Freedoms\" is a colloquial usage that should be avoided in formal writing or legal documents.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The plural form \"freedoms\" is grammatically correct and can be used in various contexts, not just legal ones. It's often employed to emphasize multiple distinct types or aspects of liberty. The example from the Legal Information Institute demonstrates its use in a formal, legal context: \"The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition.\" This shows that \"freedoms\" is acceptable in formal writing and legal documents. The initial statement about laws restricting \"freedoms\" also illustrates its use in a more general context.

In its most fundamental form, temperature $T$ is the relationship between lack of information (entropy $S$) and total energy $U$:\n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\frac{1}{T}\\=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial U}.\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nIt is a statistical parameter that measures the spread of your energy over the degrees of freedom of the system. Loosely speaking, that equation means that the higher the temperature, the less *new* degrees of freedom have to be excited for me to increase the system's energy in a thermodynamically consistent way (with lower energy states being occupied first, in a proportion known as the Boltzmann distribution).\n\nNow, consider the electromagnetic field as our system. It can have excitations, and therefore, have energy. We can define a temperature for anything with energy. The degrees of freedom of the EM field are precisely its modes of vibration. As such, the temperature is related to how many of these modes are occupied. Since lower energy modes need to be more excited at lower temperatures, and experiment tells us that lower frequencies dominate at low temperatures, we can postulate a direct relationship between energy resolution (energy of a single excitation) $E$ and mode frequency $\\\\nu$ as\n\n$$E\\=h\\\\nu,$$\n\nwhich is quite ad\\-hoc but can be made quite rigorous with in depth thermodynamic arguments. For the electromagnetic field to have temperature, it needs blackbody radiation. \n\nBut maybe you were interested in where this radiation comes from. Well, roughly speaking, electrons in materials also have statistical thermal distributions, and to maintain thermal equilibrium they are constantly being excited and dropping energy levels. This energy shifting is done through EM radiation (seeing electrons are charged particles) and has the blackbody spectrum."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An advanced physics student is studying the relationship between electromagnetic radiation and temperature. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Temperature directly changes the electromagnetic field by altering its fundamental properties.\n\nB) The temperature of an electromagnetic field is primarily determined by the number of excited vibrational modes, with lower frequency modes being more populated at lower temperatures.\n\nC) The equation E = h\u03bd describes how temperature affects the energy of electromagnetic waves, with h representing heat capacity.\n\nD) Blackbody radiation is a consequence of electrons in materials maintaining a constant energy state to achieve thermal equilibrium.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation explains that temperature in an electromagnetic field is related to how many of its vibrational modes are occupied, with lower energy (and thus lower frequency) modes being more excited at lower temperatures. This aligns with the Boltzmann distribution mentioned in the text.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because temperature doesn't directly change the electromagnetic field's fundamental properties. Rather, it's a statistical parameter measuring energy distribution across degrees of freedom.\n\nAnswer C is partially correct in mentioning the equation E = h\u03bd, but it misinterprets h as heat capacity when it's actually Planck's constant. Additionally, this equation relates energy to frequency, not directly to temperature.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it states that electrons maintain a constant energy state, which contradicts the explanation that electrons are constantly being excited and dropping energy levels to maintain thermal equilibrium, resulting in blackbody radiation."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/04", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/355096", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/204062/"], "docs_id": 355096, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Describing the situation\n------------------------\n\nI'm working on an application (based on the Spring Framework) using a search index (lucene if that matters) to make content of that application searchable. Documents are added/updated in that index whenever the content of the application is being changed and deleted whenever the corresponding content is deleted.\n\nWe had a bug where the trigger to update a document on content changes did not work in some cases. Therefore some of the documents contain invalid (out\\-dated) values. This problem has been resolved, so future changes will be correctly written to the index.\n\nHowever I want to fix the invalid documents in the index and would like to know what the best strategy would be to do so. Important conditions are:\n\n* Recalculating the complete index requires multiple hours and the application is redeployed regularly as part of continuous deployment. Therefore it must be expected that the application is shut down in between the updating process.\n* Most of the documents are not invalid.\n* I'm not able to recognize invalid documents based on the index alone. This would require lots of information from a database.\n* The invalid values of the documents are not particularly important. The most relevant field (the name) was not affected by the bug. Therefore even documents with invalid values work correctly in most of the use cases.\n* I would like a solution that will work for future issues too.\n\nI think a similar case occurs if we extend the index in future versions, e.g. add a field. This would require us to update all documents to add the field, while the main use case of the index will work without that field too.\n\nPossible solution\n-----------------\n\nMy idea is to add a version field to the documents. I would then add a job that runs all few minutes, fetches a batch of documents with an old version (or without any version for the initial run), recalculate the required fields, set the version field to the current version and update the document in the index.\n\nPros of this solution:\n\n* If the update is interrupted, the application recognizes which documents are already fixed and which aren't.\n* This information is stored within the index, so where it belongs (I had some ideas before where I would store the information in the database).\n\nCon of this solution:\n\n* Will need to update every document, even if it has no invalid values.\n\nMy question\n-----------\n\nIs this a reasonable solution for the problem? Are there any better approaches to do this? I couldn't find find anything how to solve this nor any information that it is a good idea to add a version to your documents.\n\nMaybe I'm also overthinking the situation and a much simpler solution is possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR: **You can do things faster.**\n\nI used to have a similar problem. Turns out, with Lucene, rebuilding the entire index using code optimized for it, starting from the scratch, using a `SELECT field1, field2 FROM table` query with no where clause, was quite fast. The reason for the quick execution time probably was that the Lucene\\-interfacing code didn't need to worry about parallel Lucene queries, and the SQL statement could use a sequential scan.\n\nFor this reason, we had `indexOne` and `indexAll` methods, separately written.\n\nI'm not sure if it's fast enough for your case, but you should take a hard look at the Lucene API, see what kind of performance\\-improving characteristics it has: don't synchronize for every single item? Don't care about parallel queries? Rebuild the index from the scratch? I don't remember what features of the Lucene API we used to obtain the great performance because it was 8 years ago, but I do recall the performance of `indexAll` was much better than `indexOne`.\n\nOf course, this kind of approach requires some downtime. But with good enough optimization, perhaps you can push the downtime to an acceptable level, from hours to merely minutes.\n\nIf you are unable to push the downtime to an acceptable level, your only solution is a background indexer. We had a table named `indexqueue` in the database, and it contained object identifiers. The background indexer regularly fetched rows from this table and reindexed only those rows fetched. Then you just insert every object identifier to the `indexqueue` table and wait for all to be reindexed.\n\nAs for the record count, we had millions of records. Your hundreds of thousands of records problem, with the slight progress in computer performance over 8 years and the great progress in computer memory amount, is minuscule in comparison to the millions of records of problem we had. We used spinning hard disks back then, and today's servers use SSDs!\n\nI'm pretty sure you can reindex thousands of rows per second, if doing things optimally, unless of course each row has some kind of 1000 page book text body. This makes it hundreds of thousands of rows per minute."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is facing issues with an outdated search index in a Spring Framework application.

Here's why:\n\n1. It allows for continuous operation without significant downtime, addressing the concern of regular redeployments.\n2. It's selective in updating only the necessary documents, avoiding unnecessary processing of valid entries.\n3. The 'indexqueue' approach is flexible and can handle future indexing needs or issues beyond the current problem.\n4.

I would like to switch this current off quickly, and I plan on using an IGBT to do so. Assuming that the time constant of the load \\\\$ \\\\tau \\= L/R \\\\$ is much longer than the switch off time of the IGBT, we can assume that upon switching off the IGBT, the stored inductive energy \\\\$ E \\= \\\\frac{1}{2}LI^2 \\= 22\\.5J\\\\$ will be almost entirely dissipated into the IGBT. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1\\) Is my logic above correct, i.e. in assuming that in this case there will be \\\\$E \\= 22\\.5J\\\\$ dissipated into the IGBT. \n\n2\\) What spec in a specsheet determines what the maximum value of \\\\$E\\\\$ is before damaging the transistor? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A general bit of advice for reading data sheets. If you're looking for (let's say) the power consumption, which will be in amps, or the gain bandwidth product, which will be in Hz, it's far easier to run your eye quickly down the righthand 'units' column, looking for the relevant unit, than reading down the left hand measurement description column.\n\nThis energy dissipation will be measured in Joules, and it's about the only specification in those units. It's called either the 'Unclamped Inductive Switching Energy' (UIS) or the Collector\\-Emitter Avalanche Energy.\n\nAs the inductor current is interrupted, the voltage will rise. The IGBT structure is fairly robust, and avalanches stably at the breakdown voltage, as long as the energy dumped (assumed adiabatically (that is instantaneously, without any heat loss to the surroundings)) into the junction is limited to limit the temperature rise.\n\n[This example IGBT](http://m.littelfuse.com/~/media/electronics/datasheets/power_semiconductors/littelfuse_power_semiconductor_ignition_igbt_devices_ngd8201b_datasheet.pdf.pdf) is a fairly small one, 20A 400V, designed for car ignition. It has a single pulse CE avalanche energy of around 400mJ. You might expect the spec to more or less scale with IGBT current, so it looks like you're looking for a \\>\\>1000A part before you start seeing 10s of Joules specified. This might be reasonable if you have a 300A load.\n\nIf you want to switch the current off quickly, then you need to allow the voltage to rise, and the higher the better. There are alternatives to dumping the energy in the IGBT junction. \n\nThe simplest is to put a resistor plus diode in parallel with the inductor. Arrange the resistor value R2 to develop a bit less than the IGBT's breakdown voltage at the inductor current, so that it limits the voltage across the IGBT. The current will not stop as quickly as for using a constant voltage breakdown mechanism, but heat in a big resistor is a lot easier to handle than heat in a small semiconductor junction.\n\nA faster way (more time\\-averaged voltage provided) is to charge a capacitor C3\\. If it's big enough, the voltage will be fairly constant during the pulse, and it can be steadily discharged by a low power route, R3\\.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Kxrf.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f6Kxrf.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit to switch off a 300A inductive load with an inductance of 500\u03bcH.

This method allows for precise selection of events within a specific date range without altering the original calendar or requiring manual editing of .ics files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it involves copying all events and then deleting unwanted ones, which is more time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nOption B is not recommended as it requires manual editing of the .ics file, which can be complex and may lead to formatting errors.\n\nOption D suggests using third-party software, which may not be available or reliable, and goes against the provided solution using the native calendar application."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/02", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1680346", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 1680346, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Let $f$ be a non constant entire function satisfying the following conditions :\n> \n> \n> 1. $f(0\\)\\=0$\n> 2. for every positive real $M$, the set $\\\\{z: \\\\left\\|f(z)\\\\right\\|\\<M\\\\}$ is connected.\n> \n> \n> Prove that $f(x)\\=cz^n$ for some constant $c$ and positive integer $n$.\n\nLet $f(z)\\=a\\_nz^n\\+\\\\cdots\\+a\\_1z\\+a\\_0$ be function that satisfies the given conditions.
