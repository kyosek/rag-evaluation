Very simple question: why is it called a law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> **Why do they call the power law distribution a 'law'**\n\nIn the specific case of \"power law\" the term \"power law\" is a term in science. It refers to a connection between two phenomena that have a relationship that goes as a power, $y \\\\propto x^\\\\alpha$.\n\ne.g. see this page (from Harvey Mudd College's physics dept) on [Power Law](http://www.physics.hmc.edu/analysis/power.php):\n\n> When one quantity (say y) depends on another (say x) raised to some power, we say that y is described by a power law.\n\nAlso see the Wikipedia article on [Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)\n\nThat sense of *law* similar to the use of the word for many other physical laws.\n\nThis descriptor (\"power law\") is often applied when it's the probability density of some quantity (or in discrete cases, the pmf) that has that property, $f(x) \\\\propto x^\\\\alpha$; whence \"power law distribution\".\n\nThese \"power law\" phenomena crop up a lot ... though perhaps not nearly as often as they're claimed. See A. Clauset, C.R. Shalizi, and M.E.J. Newman (2009\\), \"*Power\\-law distributions in empirical data*\" SIAM Review 51(4\\), 661\\-703\n(arxiv [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062)) and Shalizi's *So You Think You Have a Power Law \u2014 Well Isn't That Special?* (see [here](http://bactra.org/weblog/491.html)).\n\n> **Power law distribution is a distribution not a law.**\n\nHere the term \"law\" goes with \"power\" (the distribution whose density follows a \"power\\-law\") rather than distribution, but actually, in statistics, the term \"law\" was frequently used (and to a lesser extent, still is) simply as a term for *distribution*.\n\nThis is closely related to the meaning of the term \"law\" in science (the effect that some particular phenomenon always occurs if specific conditions hold). \\[There's also likely some connection to the use of the word law in mathematics, as a kind of mathematical rule.]\n\nSo for example, under certain conditions, you'd expect quantities to have something like a normal distribution (measured quantities with lots of small errors adding together, the conditions for the \"normal law\"), and under other conditions you'd expect quantities to have something like a Poisson distribution (counting rare events happening at constant rate, independently, the conditions for the \"Poisson law\")\n\nSo you can readily find references to \"normal law\", \"Poisson law\" (sometimes \"the law of small numbers\" or \"the law of rare events\") and so on.\n\ne.g.\n\n1. see the end of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Extensions) of the Wikipedia article on the normal distribution:\n\n> * Pearson distribution\u2014 a four\\-parametric family of probability distributions that extend **the normal law** to include different skewness and kurtosis values.\n2. In the [Notes section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Notes) of the Wikipedia article on the Poisson distribution:\n\n> 17. Raikov, D. (1937\\). On the decomposition of **Poisson laws**. Comptes Rendus (Doklady) de l' Academie des Sciences de l'URSS, 14, 9\u201311\\. (The proof is also given in von Mises, Richard (1964\\). Mathematical Theory of Probability and Statistics. New York: Academic Press.)\n3. Same article, see the end of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Law_of_rare_events):\n\n> The word law is sometimes used as a synonym of probability distribution, and convergence in law means convergence in distribution. Accordingly, the Poisson distribution is sometimes called the law of small numbers because it is the probability distribution of the number of occurrences of an event that happens rarely but has very many opportunities to happen.\n\n(emphases mine)\n\nSo \"law\" can mean \"distribution\", but in the phrase \"power law distribution\" it doesn't, since \"distribution\" already takes that role (as mentioned earlier, it's the distribution that has a \"power\\-law\" in the scientific sense). However, when the phrase \"power law\" without the word \"distribution\" is nevertheless referring to a distribution, it *can* be taken to carry that meaning, as for example, in the title of Shalizi's blog item above \"So You Think You Have a Power Law\" (clearly one wouldn't say \"Power\\-law Law\" in that case, since the first \"law\" can convey the entire sense on its own)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the term \"power law\" in the context of statistics and its relationship to distributions?\n\nA) The term \"power law\" exclusively refers to a type of distribution and has no other scientific meaning.\n\nB) \"Power law\" is a scientific term describing a relationship where one quantity depends on another raised to some power, and this concept is applied to certain probability distributions.\n\nC) In statistics, \"law\" always means the same thing as \"distribution,\" so \"power law distribution\" is a redundant term.\n\nD) The \"law\" in \"power law distribution\" refers to a strict mathematical rule that all such distributions must follow without exception.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it accurately captures the dual nature of the term \"power law.\" In science, a power law refers to a relationship where one quantity is proportional to another raised to some power (y \u221d x^\u03b1). This concept is then applied to certain probability distributions where the probability density function follows this power law relationship.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"power law\" has a broader scientific meaning beyond just describing a distribution.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while \"law\" can sometimes be used synonymously with \"distribution\" in statistics, it's not always the case. In \"power law distribution,\" the \"law\" part refers to the power relationship, not the distribution itself.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while power law distributions follow a specific pattern, it's not a strict rule without exceptions, and the term \"law\" in this context doesn't imply absolute adherence in all cases."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/19", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/758402", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/183659/"], "docs_id": 758402, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My problem is that there is a legacy system for building automation (ventilation, temperature, lighting etc) without the possibility for upgrades, that needs to send text messages through a connected GSM modem.

If you lift your pen and let go, it falls. It also falls when you do it again. And again. And 1000 times. And also when 1000 people do it 1000 times. In the end you start trusting this as something that will always happen \\- you can't prove it, but you still trust it to happen again next time you try.\n\nNewton saw in this way that this just happens to be how the world works. It isn't an explanation, just an observation of the nature of the world.\n\nWe call it **a law of nature**; it can't be proven, but we trust it to work because it has done so many times before.

There are two patches of ground near you, one containing a single frog, the other containing two frogs. Your survival depends on you finding a female frog in one of these two patches, but you only get to make one attempt. You cannot tell which frogs are which in advance, except that you know that one of the frogs in the patch with two frogs in is male.\n\nThe answer given to the riddle is that the odds of the single frog being female is 50%, but the odds of one of the two frogs being female is 2/3 (67%). The explanation being that there are four possible combinations of male female pairs, one is excluded because we know one frog is male, hence 2/3 combinations where we find a female frog in the pair and 1/3 where we don't.\n\nThe probabilities just seem wrong to me; can anyone clarify the reason why this is the case?\n\nI suspect that there is a subtly in the framing of the question that I'm missing.\n\nAs i read the problem, we have a choice of two options, both of which are simply a 50:50 chance of whether a single frog is male or female. Not knowing which frog in the pair is definitely male should have no effect on the probability of the other. \n\nIf I am wrong I really want to understand why!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's look at the pair of frogs. Male frogs are identified by croaking in the video. \n\nAs explained in the video, before we hear any croaking, there are 4 equally likely outcomes given 2 frogs:\n\n* Frog 1 is Male, Frog 2 is Male\n* Frog 1 is Female, Frog 2 is Male\n* Frog 1 is Male, Frog 2 is Female\n* Frog 1 is Female, Frog 2 is Female\n\nMaking the assumptions about males and females occurring equally and independently, our sample space is $\\\\{(M,M),(F,M),(M,F),(F,F)\\\\}$, and we have probability $1/4$ for each element.\n\nNow, once we hear the croak coming from this pair, we know that at least one frog is male. Thus the event $(F,F)$ is impossible. We then have a *new, reduced sample space* induced by this condition: $\\\\{(M,M),(F,M),(M,F)\\\\}$. Each remaining possibility is still equally likely, and the probability of all the events added together must be $1$. So the probability of each of these three events in the new sample space must be $1/3$.\n\nThe only event that ends badly for us is $(M,M)$, so there is a $2/3$ chance of survival.\n\n---\n\nMore formally, the definition of conditional probability says:\n\n$$P(A\\|B) \\= \\\\frac{P(A \\\\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nSo if $A$ is the event that at least one female is present and $B$ is the event that at least one male is present, we have:\n\\\\begin{align}P(\\\\text{F given at least 1 M}) \\&\\= \\\\frac{P(\\\\text{F and at least 1 male})}{P(\\\\text{at least 1 M})}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{P(\\\\text{1 M and 1 F})}{P(\\\\text{1 M or 2 M})} \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{P\\[(M,F),(F,M)]}{P\\[(M,M),(F,M),(M,F)]} \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\frac{1/2}{3/4} \\= 2/3 \\\\end{align}\n\nThis is really the same procedure we reasoned through as above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the frog riddle:\n\nQuestion: In a variation of the frog riddle, there are now three patches of ground: Patch A with one frog, Patch B with two frogs, and Patch C with three frogs.

What is the probability of finding a female frog if you choose Patch C?\n\nA) 1/3\nB) 1/2\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/4\n\nCorrect Answer: A) 1/3\n\nExplanation: \nFor Patch C with three frogs, given that at least two are male, we have these possible combinations:\n(M,M,M), (M,M,F)\n\nThe sample space is reduced to these two equally likely outcomes. Only one of these outcomes (M,M,F) contains a female frog. Therefore, the probability of finding a female frog in Patch C is 1/3.\n\nOption B (1/2) would be the probability for Patch A, where there's a single frog with no additional information.\n\nOption C (2/3) would be the probability for Patch B, as explained in the original riddle.\n\nOption D (1/4) is not correct for any of the patches in this scenario."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/17", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/414948", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/373158/"], "docs_id": 414948, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems like the URLs are always Base encoded yielding a short string instead.

When `anacron` is invoked (which can happen at boot time, and also during predefined hours of the day), it will read a list of jobs from the `/etc/anacrontab` configuration file. For each job, `anacron` checks if the job has been executed in last n days. For a daily job, this will be the last 1 day, i.e. today. If the job has not been run in this period, anacron executes the job.\n\nOnce the job runs to completion, `anacron` records the date of execution in a file, under `/var/spool/anacron`. This file is used to check the job's status when anacron is invoked the next day.\n\nSince `anacron` only looks at the days elapsed since last execution and the configured frequency of execution, there is no problem of a job being executed multiple times.\n\nA daily anacron job can be set up in the `/etc/anacrontab` configuration file using the following syntax:\n\n```\n1 15 backup-job /path/to/backup/script.sh\n\n```\n\n1 is the frequency of executing the command specified in days, 15 is a delay in minutes added to the execution of the job, 'backup\\-job' is an identifier, and '/path/to/backup/script.sh' is the command to be executed. You can take a look at [`man 8 anacron`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/anacron) and [`man 5 anacrontab`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/anacrontab) for more details."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has set up a daily backup job using anacron with the following entry in /etc/anacrontab:\n\n1 15 daily-backup /usr/local/bin/backup.sh\n\nThe system experiences an unexpected 3-day outage.

The idea was to charge a capacitor separately and then connect it to the coil to have a strong and brief magnetic field, but they don't discharge properly.\n\nI've tried to charge them using batteries (9V), phone chargers (5V, 2A) and also a car charger (12V, 5A) and despite the capacitor's voltage being the same as the source's, it doesn't give any measurable power output, and even though there's no particular power output, the capacitor's voltage after the process is always 0\\.\n\nI tried with a 16V, 47\u03bcF capacitor and it went as I described, after the fifth time it worked, but only once, and all the other tries were pretty useless. I also tried to change capacitors (I tried with a 16V, 220 \u03bcF, a 16V, 470\u03bcF and a 16V, 1000uF capacitor) and nothing changed.\nI was expecting a surge in the current and therefore in the magnetic field, but it doesn't happen.\n\nI didn't use any particular circuit to charge the capacitor; I've simply connected it to the power source (battery or charger) using wires, without any switch. Sometimes I included the amperometer to see when the current stopped flowing. The same goes for the discharge, I've simply connected the capacitor and the coil using wires.\n\nTo know when the capacitor is charged I put an amperometer in series, when the current reaches zero I disconnect the capacitor from the charger and then I measure the voltage and verify that is roughly the same as the source's voltage. After the \"discharge\" I measure the voltage of the capacitor again and verify that is zero.\n\nTo minimize the resistance of the circuit and also to know if there is a current flowing in it, I avoid using the multimeter and instead measure the magnetic field generated by the coil (but it remains practically zero, so I assume that there's something wrong). To measure the currents and the voltages I use a multimeter (which has a resolution of 10mV and an accuracy of \\+/\\-0\\.8% for the voltage and a resolution of 10mA and an accuracy of \\+/\\-2\\.0% for the currents.\n\nI charged the capacitors connecting the negative wire of the source to the negative pole of the capacitor and the positive wire of the source to the positive pole of the capacitor.\n\n[![Here is my setup](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6UHFn.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6UHFn.jpg)\n\nMy wires are taken from a scientific toy kit.

I suspect if you used a more sensitive instrument on your coil you would see the effect. Try a compass and you will likely see the needle \"wiggle\".\n\nThe problem here is that you're failing to take into account how much energy must be dumped into this coil that you have built in order to get a large magnetic transient generated. Large magnetic transient requires a large electric current which means you have to have a large capacitor. None of the capacitors you mentioned qualify as \"large\".\n\nI'm going to guess based on what I see in your photo that a capacitance of several thousand microFarads or more will be needed. You might look into one of those large capacitors that are used in automotive sound system installations. It's not uncommon to find those in values of 0\\.5 to 1\\.0 Farads or even more."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electronics student is attempting to generate a strong, brief magnetic field pulse using a capacitor and coil setup.

The capacitance values used (47\u03bcF to 1000\u03bcF) are too small to generate a strong, observable magnetic field pulse in the coil. As explained in the top answer, a large magnetic transient requires a large electric current, which in turn requires a large capacitor. The answer suggests that capacitors in the range of several thousand microfarads or even 0.5 to 1.0 Farads (as used in automotive sound systems) would be more appropriate for this application.

In this case, the need to split messages due to an API limitation is clearly a technical constraint rather than a business-driven rule. If notifications were sent via paper forms, for example, this limitation wouldn't exist.

UI module has a feature to share the database, in which a copy of the database can be sent to another person. Now to attach my database for share feature UI module requires my database path. So, UI team requested to expose a public API to get the database path.\n\nI am concern about security perspective of exposing database path as a public API. What are the general guideline to share the database for other modules? Should I expose my database path via public API? If so, is there any implication on further security vulnerability and does it violate the abstraction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a security perspective, the risks involved with exposing a database path/connection string to other modules in the same application, where those modules are developed by the same organisation, are low. It would take at least a bug in another component to expose the database path outside the application, but all those components can be vetted for improper use of this API.  \n\nAdditionally, given the feature that asks for it, the database contents are probably not all that sensitive anyway.\n\nFrom a design perspective, there are only a few reasons to expose the database path outside the component that deals with the database:\n\n* configuration: It might be that the database path is read from a configuration file which is handled by a configuration module\n* To show/edit by the user: There might be a feature whereby the user can see and/or change the database path. This could be coupled with the configuration mentioned before.\n\nThis database sharing feature appears to fit none of those reasons, so there should not be a reason to expose the database path for it. But, the iOS API use to do the actual sharing may need to receive the name of a file that gets shared. In that case, there are only two ways to implement the feature: you either pass that API the path to your actual database file, or the application copies the database contents into a new file.\n\nTo keep the separation of responsibilities between the components clear, I would go for a design like this:\n\n* the database module offers an API to get the name of a file with the database contents in a format suitable for sharing\n* the UI module can use that API to implement their part of the sharing feature\n* the database module implements the API by either providing the actual database path, or by copying the database content to a file.

It maintains the separation of concerns between modules.\n2. It doesn't expose the actual database path, reducing potential security risks.\n3. It provides the necessary functionality for the sharing feature without compromising the database module's encapsulation.\n4. It allows the database module to control how the data is prepared for sharing, which could include creating a copy or using the actual file, without the UI module needing to know the implementation details.\n5. It's flexible and can be revised by the database team without affecting the UI module's implementation.\n\nOption A, while not highly risky, unnecessarily exposes internal details.

The first packet the client transmits is a PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation (PADI) which is sent to the Ethernet broadcast address (all ones in binary, all f's in hex: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). And PPPoE ACs on the network respond with PADO's (Offers). The client notes the source MAC address of the PPPoE AC that sent the PADO the client is interested in, and replies to that MAC address with a PADR (Request). If the AC accepts the request, it responds with a PADS (Session\\-confirmation).\n\nPPPoE Active Discovery uses EtherType 0x8863\\.\n\nAfter Active Discovery completes, the PPPoE client and AC start sending frames using the PPPoE Session EtherType 0x8864\\.

The PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation (PADI) packet is indeed broadcast by the client to discover PPPoE Access Concentrators on the network. It uses the EtherType 0x8863, which is specific to PPPoE Active Discovery.\n\nOption A is incorrect because PADI is sent by the client, not the Access Concentrator, and it uses EtherType 0x8863, not 0x8864.\n\nOption C is incorrect because PADI is a broadcast packet, not a unicast packet. The unicast communication to a specific AC happens later in the process with the PADR (Request) packet.\n\nOption D is incorrect because PADI is the initial packet in the discovery process, not the final one.

Clocks are fundamental to synchronous sequential logic, which is the dominant paradigm in modern computer design. As explained in the documentation, synchronous logic simplifies circuit design and ensures reliability by providing a consistent timing mechanism.

For a holomorphic vector bundle E of rank r > 1 with a singular hermitian metric h that is negatively curved in the sense of Griffiths, we can still relate the first Chern class c\u2081(E) to the metric h under certain conditions. \n\nSpecifically, if det h \u2260 0 and log det h \u2208 L\u00b9\u2097\u2092\ud835\udcb8(X) (i.e., log det h is locally integrable), then c\u2081(E) can be represented by (i/2\u03c0)\u2202\u2202\u0304log det h.

Nearly every pair of outlets has one of the outlets connected to a light switch. Sometimes that switch is quite far from the outlet even when there are other closer switches that seem to control nothing at all. Sometimes that switch also controls overhead lighting, which makes no sense to me from a design standpoint. Sometimes that switch is a dimmer switch, which is a really horrible idea as if you plug anything other than a light bulb into it, like some electronics, the dimmer switch could do them a lot of damage. One such dimmer switch is also connected to a ceiling fan, and setting the switch to anything less than full does not change the speed of the fan, it just makes it a lot noisier (AC induction motor, obviously).\n\nThere are light fixtures that don't seem to have any power to them and aren't controlled by any switch, though I could believe the switch might just be hiding somewhere. There are also switches that seem to control absolutely nothing, though I could believe I just haven't found what they're connected to.\n\nThe oddest thing I have found though has to do with the circuit breakers around overhead lighting. I have a chandelier in my dining room that is connected to a dimmer switch. When I moved in, all of the bulbs were incandescents, and I wanted to be more energy efficient, so I replaced them all with dimmable LED bulbs. Now however, I could not turn the chandelier fully off, with the dimmer switch all the way down, the lights still dimly shone. This had never been an issue before, but I thought it probably meant the dimmer switch was faulty, and it was just the different voltage response curves of the incandescents versus the LEDs that meant it had never been noticed before, so I set out to replace the switch.\n\nNow there are two circuit breakers that are relevant to this chandelier. One is labeled \"dining room,\" the other is labeled \"lights.\" As far as I can tell, the dining room breaker controls all of the outlets in the dining room area, while the lights breaker controls all of the overhead lighting in the house.\n\nHere's where the odd part comes in. If I turn off the dining room breaker, the lights stay lit. I have turn off the lights breaker to switch off the lights. However, if I only turn off the lights breaker, and go into the switch panel with my voltmeter, I am still detecting 100V AC across the switch (with it off), even though the lights stay off when I turn the switch on. In order to remove the power I was detecting, I have to also turn off the dining room breaker, even though the lights were staying on when I switched that off.\n\nThis conforms to no type of electrical theory with which I am familiar, though there might be some peculiarity of household wiring I don't know about that explains this. Can anyone tell me what might be going on?\n\n**Update 3/24/19:** After replacing the dining room dimmer switch with one specifically designed for LEDs, those lights are now working quite well. Based on several people's advice in this question, I have now set out to replace the bedroom dimmer switches that are connected to outlets with toggle switches.

It might even go away if you were to attach an analog voltmeter (which is more of a load because current from the line to move the needle) instead of a digital one (which typically has a 1 M\u03a9 input impedance that presents almost no load)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a home wiring issue where 100V AC is detected across a light switch even when the main \"lights\" circuit breaker is off.

The phenomenon described is likely due to inductive and capacitive coupling between parallel wire runs in the house. This can occur in homes with unusual wiring configurations, especially where there are long runs between outlets and switches. When wires run parallel to each other for significant distances, electromagnetic coupling can induce a voltage in a disconnected wire from a nearby powered wire. This induced voltage typically has no significant current capacity and would disappear if a load were applied. The question mentions that 100V AC is detected with a voltmeter when the circuit breaker is off, which is consistent with this explanation.

To me the main feature of the notion \u2018habit\u2019 is an *inclination* to do something in a particular manner. For example, I could say \u2018I have a habit to eat eggs for breakfast\u2019. Habit in this context doesn\u2019t require any skill, while shooting a basketball does. Moreover, I could lose a skill (or even ability) to do something, but a habit could remain, I just won\u2019t be able to satisfy my habit (or it would be more difficult if I lose a skill in the sense of 'navyk').\n\n**Update**.\n\nThe word \"skill\" could be applied not only to physical activities, such as shooting a basketball, but also to mental activities. For example, we can say \u201ccommunication skills\u201d or \u201cmathematical skills\u201d etc. And the distinction between the two types of skills I mentioned in the original question is applicable for mental activities as well.\n\nLet me give an example of what I believe is called a spelling skill. For most of the words we use we don\u2019t have to think about how to spell them, because we read or wrote them too often. But in some cases we have to think about the correct spelling by remembering some rules or etymology of a particular word. Here, again, we can distinguish two kinds of skills: first is the one I called \u201cnavyk\u201d, and the second one is \u201cumeniye\u201d.\n\nThis example illustrates that the notion of muscle memory, which has been offered, doesn\u2019t really fit the concept I\u2019m trying to find a word for.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Muscle memory**\n\nFrom [Oxford living dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/muscle_memory):\n\n> The ability to reproduce a particular movement without conscious thought, acquired as a result of frequent repetition of that movement.\n\nI think it fits your example quite well: the kid has a **muscle memory** of how to shoot the basketball.

Should I keep all the categories? Is this a real finding or a fluke? I know dichotomising is generally not a good idea but I thought it's warranted with such a variables where Yes and No are so clearcut.\n\nFor context, this is not my main research question, I'm looking at many potential risk factors and it's just one of them so I don't necessarily need to analyse it too deeply.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you test every number of children separately, you're running seven tests. According to Bonferroni, for making sure that you have a probability of smaller than 5% to find a significant result if in fact nothing is going on, you've got to run every single test at level 0\\.05/7\\. This is smaller than the p\\-value for 3 children. From this point of view nothing significant is going on in either situation. You may well keep all categories, but this doesn't give you a meaningful significance. (Obviously you could find that p\\-value suspicious and collect much more data to see whether it becomes even more significant, but it may not be worth the hassle.)\n\nAdded later: There was some discussion about whether it is wrong to treat the number of children as categorical, actually being a number, and what to do instead.\n\nGenerally I agree with the view that it makes sense to use the numerical meaning of the data. However this will usually involve assumptions about the functional form of the relationship. An important principle is that all available subject\\-matter knowledge should be used *before* actually analysing the data, as making modelling decisions based on the data will often produce selection bias effects and runs counter to theory behind some standard methods such as the significance tests for the coefficients.\n\nSo that first step *before seeing the data* should be to ask what kind of functional relationship could make sense here. The easiest assumed relationship would be linearity, but linearity may not be realistic, particularly because there may be a much bigger difference between 0 and any number of children than between two nonzero numbers of children (of course I can't tell without knowing the exact background). Also the relationship may be non\\-monotonic.\n\nAn additional problem is the question what can be identified from the data at what precision. Standard errors for 5, 6, 7 (maybe even 4\\) children suggest that there is not much data for these and whatever can be said will be very imprecise. In fact one could know this already from the plain numbers of observations falling into these categories (taking those into account will hardly bias later analyses as they don't imply information about the regression relationship).\n\nThis means that there may not be enough information to nail down confidently any relationship more complex (i.e., requiring more parameters) than a linear one, and making assumptions that require only a low number of parameters to be estimated is certainly desirable. This also means that treating the larger numbers of children as autonomous categories doesn't give useful information either. The standard errors of about 19 suggest that there is hardly any power to detect anything; for sure shown results cannot even exclude the possibility that there is a monotonic or even linear relationship (or none at all), even though the latter may not be realistic.\n\nIf relationships don't follow simple functional forms, in fact aggregation of categories can be a sensible choice; depending on the background comparing zero with existing children may be justifiable, and in general even something like \"zero\", \"one or two\", \"more than two\" can work better than either using all numbers as separate categories (particularly with very thin numbers on some categories) or assuming linearity or a more complex functional form. As said before, optimally such decisions should be made before seeing the data (or at least the regression relationship); however looking at the data may reveal a *striking* specific deviation from an initial assumption/decision, in which case model selection bias is probably less bad than sticking to an inappropriate initial decision at any cost.\n\nFrom the numbers I currently see, I suspect however that clear evidence for any influence of this variable whatsoever cannot be found in the given data, and I'd be very skeptical if any of the ideas above applied at this time point would lead to a just about significant p\\-value, which in that case may well be explained by model selection bias.\n\nNote also, as discussed elsewhere, that looking at p\\-values often isn't a very good way of doing variable selection."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An analyst is investigating the relationship between number of children and treatment outcome. They run two analyses: one with a dichotomized variable (children vs. no children) and another keeping all categories (0-7 children). The analysis with all categories shows a significant association for having 3 children (p = 0.0427). Given this information and the context provided, what is the most appropriate interpretation and next step?\n\nA) The finding for 3 children is likely valid and should be reported as is, since keeping all categories is generally better than dichotomizing.\n\nB) The result should be considered non-significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and no association should be reported.\n\nC) The analysis should be redone using the number of children as a continuous variable to test for a linear relationship with the outcome.\n\nD) The categories should be aggregated into meaningful groups (e.g., 0, 1-2, 3+) based on subject-matter knowledge, and the analysis should be repeated.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The analysis with all categories effectively runs 7 separate tests, one for each number of children from 0 to 7. To maintain an overall significance level of 0.05, a Bonferroni correction should be applied, dividing 0.05 by 7. This results in a corrected significance threshold of approximately 0.007, which the p-value for 3 children (0.0427) does not meet. Therefore, after correction, the result should be considered non-significant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the multiple comparison problem. Option C, while potentially valid in some contexts, assumes a linear relationship which may not be appropriate, and doesn't address the immediate issue of multiple comparisons. Option D presents a reasonable approach for future analyses, but it doesn't directly address the interpretation of the current results and could introduce bias if done post-hoc based on the observed data."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/09", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/106183", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/64398/"], "docs_id": 106183, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The [optimum zone](http://www.cleanaire.co.nz/IAQ++Health/Humidity.html) of the relative humidity of one's home at any given time is between 40% and 60%.

This is the lowest figure that the hygrometer is capable of outputting, so the actual RH could be even lower than that. (I have not found an inexpensive hygrometer that is capable of displaying RH levels below 20%.) Naturally, this reading spurred me to turn on the humidifier.\n\nI have an Aprilaire central humidifier next to my furnace. It is an old unit (around 25 years old), but it still functions.

The condensation is on the inside of the windows, not between the panes. Some windows are practically coated edge\\-to\\-edge in water droplets, requiring several paper towels to absorb it all. I wipe it off, and the condensation fully returns within an hour or two.\n\nGravity makes the condensation drip down the length of the window, which gets absorbed by the surrounding wooden window trim. This has resulted in trim that is pitch black in some areas, an indicator of dry rot, I assume. I touch the wood and I can feel that it is very wet.\n\nWanting to prevent dry rot from occurring and further destroying my trim, I tried to find a fix online. I found this [article](http://www.startribune.com/fixit-what-is-the-ideal-winter-indoor-humidity-level/11468916/) from *Star Tribune*, the largest newspaper in Minnesota. Excerpt:\n\n> The following list, supplied by the Minnesota Department of Public\n>  Service, is based on a double\\-glazed window and an indoor temperature\n>  of 70 degrees.

I thought that an RH below 40% was too dry for one's body. But, according to the above prescription, based on the outdoor weather conditions, my current indoor RH should not exceed 30%. In some extreme cases, it should be as low as 15%.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Why does condensation form on the inside of my windows in the winter?\n2. Why does the amount of condensation seem to significantly increase at night? My thermostat and humidifier settings are constant.\n3. The recommended RH range for one's health or one's furnishings contradicts the recommended RH range to prevent condensation on windows. How do you choose which guideline to abide by? In an indoor environment with an RH of 30%, I would be breathing in dry air and drying out wood furnishings. Shouldn't one's health take precedence over the development of window condensation?\n4. Is there anything I can do to stop the formation of condensation on windows, besides decreasing the indoor RH level? (I suppose that I could periodically walk from window to window, wiping off the condensation with a towel, but I'd have to do this so regularly that it would nearly be a part\\-time job.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (1\\) Condensation forms on the inside of the cold windows in the winter because warm air in the house can hold more water vapor than cool air. Once warm air in contact with the cool window is cooled below the dew point, water falls out of the air and onto the surface of the glass. An ice cold drink left out on the counter sweats for exactly the same reason.\n\n(2\\) All else being equal, condensation forms on the inside of the windows more rapidly at night because the temperature of the indoor window surface is colder at night. The colder the windows are, the more water will fall out of the air onto the surface of the glass. If you want to know the exact temperature that condensation will start to form, it can be looked up on a psychrometric chart like this one:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WNP8.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WNP8.gif)\n\nFind the intersection of dry bulb temperature and relative humidity, then follow the dashed diagonal enthalpy line intersecting that point left and up to the edge of the curved area on the chart (the line marked \u201csaturation temp\u201d). That is the temperature at which your air will start to deposit condensate on surfaces. As you can see on the chart, cold air with a high RH carries less water in it than warm air with a moderate RH and cold air requires even colder surfaces before the remaining water vapor will condense.\n\n(3\\) Set the humidity in the house low enough that there is little condensation on the windows. Very low humidity (\\< 20% RH) can be hard on one\u2019s skin and one\u2019s wood furniture, but 30% RH is not that bad. When you witness large amounts of condensation on the windows there may also be condensation in cold locations concealed within the walls and roof, and that moisture can lead to water damage or mold growth. Water damage and mold growth are harder on one\u2019s health and pocket book than dry air.\n\n(4\\) (a) Check that the supply registers are not aimed directly at the windows. With a central humidifier running, the air from the registers can be much more humid than the room average. There will be less condensation on the windows if the registers are aimed to mix with room air before coming in direct contact with the glass. If the registers cannot be adjusted to mix supply air into the room without directly hitting the glass, then consider adding directional covers to the registers or replacing the registers. (b) Decrease the room temperature. At any given relative humidity, cool air carries less water than warm air, leading to less condensation on the glass."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is experiencing condensation on their windows during winter.
