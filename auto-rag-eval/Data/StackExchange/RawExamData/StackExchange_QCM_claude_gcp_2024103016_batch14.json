We have a domain office.ourfirm.com which we would like to be able to reach our network server on. One of ADSL connections is already a DNS entry for office.ourfirm.com.\n\nWe would like to use the other connection as a backup. I know there is \"round robin\" DNS but that isn't a redundancy system is it? How would you suggest we get this other ADSL connection added to the DNS so one ADSL will act as a failover for the other?\n\nExample:\nIf one of the ADSL lines goes down, the other is used seamlessly.\n\nCheers\nChris\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've done this multiple times before. The way I do it is with a dynamic DNS provider like dyndns.org. \n\n1. Set up your router to prefer traffic out one connection. At the least, do this for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (there are benefits to this \\-\\- some web apps will not like it if you use the same session but bounce between different IPs, and will log you out). This means no HTTP(S) traffic goes out over your secondary connection unless the primary is down.\n2. Create a dynamic DNS account and record for office.ourfirm.com\n3. Install the dynamic DNS client on an internal server.\n\nWhen the dyn DNS client updates your record, it will usually come from your primary connection, and so everything will come to that IP. If the connection goes down, it will start coming from your secondary connection, and thus you get your failover. If you lose a connection, it will take up to as long as your dyn DNS client updates before coming back up (5 minutes maybe? less with \"pro\" accounts).\n\n---\n\nThere's two ways to do the dyn DNS account:\n\n1. Get a premium account where it can host DNS for you (you can host ourfirm.com, or just delegate office.ourfirm.com to the service).\n2. Create a domain using their hosting services, like ourfirm.dyndns.org (which will be an A record hosted by dyndns). Set up office.ourfirm.com to be a CNAME to ourfirm.dyndns.org. Often this method will be free.\n\n---\n\nOn a side note regarding fail\\-over, you mention two ADSL connections. That's great and all, but there are several considerations here:\n\n* If they're both accounts from the same provider, all you're really getting is redundancy from your DSL modem in your office. If the phone lines, your provider, or their upstream provider go down, you're still offline regardless of having a failover.\n* Do the lines come in on the same sets of phone lines? Most datacenters put in lots of effort to ensure their upstream connections come physically from different directions and come into the building in separate places. This ensures that eg, a construction crew can't take out a line and kill all your connections in one swoop.\n* If they're different providers, are they still on the same upstream connections? Figure out what your ISP's providers are (hopefully they have more than one). If you have two different ISPs but they both share the same upstream provider, you still aren't totally protected.\n* With DSL, often it's the phone company that provides the DSL and resells bandwidth and access to ISPs (eg, Bell Nexxia). In this case, you're still dependent on one company (your local phone company) to have their DSL network up, even if the actual internet bandwidth comes from different places.\n\n---\n\nAt my current office we have failover exactly as described, and our primary connection is cable, and our secondary is DSL. Nothing is shared between the two, and both are major ISPs with multiple upstream connections to the internet backbone. I'm sure somewhere it's vulnerable to a backhoe operator, but at least they're completely physically different cables maintained by different companies, so there's very little chance of something that will kill both.\n\nI'd highly recommend using two different technologies for the best redundancy. There are many possible ways to connect now, so it's not overly difficult or expensive in most places: cable, DSL, fibre, satellite, wireless, GSM/cellular."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to implement failover between two ADSL connections for their office.ourfirm.com domain.

Still, I can't find a tutorial how this fits together.\n\nFirst, to make automatic core updates with FS\\_method \"direct\" work, mostly all of WordPress has to be owned by www\\-data, i.e.:\n\n```\nchown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/wordpress\n\n```\n\nFurthermore, I have a local account \"sftp\\-wordpress\" which I put into the group \"www\\-data\".\n\nI made wp\\-content and everything inside group\\-writable (group is www\\-data, see above), so sftp\\-wordpress is able to write, and \\- to be on the safe side\\- I made \"wp\\-content\" and its subdirectories setgid:\n\n```\nchmod -R g+w /var/www/wordpress/wp-content\nfind /var/www/wordpress/wp-content -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \\;\n\n```\n\n**First problem:** To setup the chroot, I put the following in /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config:\n\n```\nMatch User sftp_wordpress\n    ChrootDirectory /var/www/wordpress/wp-content\n    ForceCommand internal-sftp -u 0002\n    AllowTcpForwarding no\n\n```\n\nThis won't work, since OpenSSH doesn't like the permissions and the owner of the ChrootDirectory:\n\n```\nfatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory \"/var/www/wordpress/wp-content\"\n\n```\n\nSo I took out the chroot requirement for now, by disabling the ChrootDirectory directive.\n\nAt this point, I'm able to upload files into wp\\-content. The files will show up with owner \"sftp\\-wordpress\" (that might be a **problem** for the WordPress update?) and group \"www\\-data\".\n\n**What is definitely another problem** is that uploaded files and directories are not group\\-writable, so that the Apache process won't be able to modify them. And this is a problem if WordPress wants to modify them.\n\nThe \"umask 0002\" won't help, since (unlike other questions here say) it won't *enforce* group\\-write permission.\n\nIn fact uploaded files will be group\\-writable on the server, **if** they were group\\-writable on the client \\- that's far from a solution, since you can't expect that SFTP will fix this on their side.\n\n**I'd like to hear if there is a consistent solution for this setup of WordPress.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The chroot directory needs to be owned by root in order for openssh to accept it, it's for security purposes.\n\nFor further explanation see: [bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component](https://serverfault.com/questions/584986/bad-ownership-or-modes-for-chroot-directory-component)\n\n> **ChrootDirectory**  \n> \n>  Specifies the pathname of a directory to chroot(2\\) to after\n>  authentication. ***All components of the pathname must be root\\-owned \n>  directories that are not writable by any other user or\n>  group***. After the chroot, sshd(8\\) changes the working directory\n>  to the user's home directory.\n\nI think a solution could be to separate the upload location from where it will be viewable by wordpress.\n\nYou could create kind of a staging area where the user can upload files through the openssh sftp server in a chrooted location. Then your system has a cronjob which runs a script at regular intervals which will check the upload location and does whatever is appropriate with the uploaded files.\n\nIt could just send an email asking for human intervention, or it does some automated file checking, virus scans, whatever you think may be worthwhile. Then copy or move the file to the location where wordpress can handle it.\n\nI think there is not really a consistent solution as many situations are quite unique.

In a nutshell, the main difference between them is that hosted apps are the ones that you are thinking of (ones that display a hosted website), and packaged apps are apps that are more self\\-contained (and include most if not all of their HTML and CSS files, or resources).\n\nOn the WrongPlanet forums, there was an interesting page that describes [some of the reasons that a developer might make a hosted app](http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt178657.html). One reason that [Apple in my Eye](http://www.wrongplanet.net/forums-profile-viewprofile-u-19157.html) pointed out was:\n\n> It may technically be a website, but it functions indistinguishably from a normal non\\-web\\-browser app. Also, turning it into a shortcut strips away all the irrelevant browsers controls so that it looks like a normal app window.\n\n[NeantHumain](http://www.wrongplanet.net/forums-profile-viewprofile-u-42.html) continued on the discussion by saying:\n\n> Google Chrome apps are just web apps written in HTML5 that take advantage of new features like canvas, video, SVG, WebGL, and a bunch of new APIs that can be accessed through JavaScript for everything from geolocation to offline storage to web workers for a sort of multithreading.\n\nSo, in other words, it seems that more goes on in the background of a hosted app than just displaying a webpage. **It allows the developer to extend the functionality of the website, and bypass some of the restrictions that a normal website may encounter.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key difference between hosted apps and packaged apps in the context of Google Chrome, and what is a primary advantage of creating a hosted app?\n\nA) Hosted apps are self-contained with all resources included, while packaged apps display hosted websites.

If you want the commands to execute *only* when logging in via `ssh`, place commands into `/etc/ssh/sshrc`. (If you don't mind users overriding the commands with their own `~/.ssh/rc` file.)\n\nIf you want to *force* a user to execute one program, *and only one program*, then the `ForceCommand` option as described by DigitalRoss is a good approach. (I personally would further confine the user with a [mandatory access control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) system such as [AppArmor](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor/), [SELinux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), [TOMOYO](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en), or [SMACK](http://schaufler-ca.com/), to ensure the program can not allow a user to escape. I've worked on AppArmor for ten years, so that's the tool I'd pick first, but the others are fine tools written by excellent programmers.)\n\nIf you just want one program to execute *and not bother the user in any way*, then the best approach is to use the `pam_exec(8)` module, which cannot be bypassed, works regardless of shell, and provides easy ability to run as the user or as the user account of the program performing the authorization. The manpage gives the following example:\n\n```\n   Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to rebuild the\n   NIS database after each local password change:\n\n               passwd optional pam_exec.so seteuid make -C /var/yp\n\n   This will execute the command\n\n       make -C /var/yp\n\n   with effective user ID.\n\n```\n\nThis could be extended to run on `auth`, `account`, `password`, and `session` actions; probably `session` would be best for executing upon log in. Just add a line like:\n\n```\nsession optional pam_exec.so log=/var/log/ssh_login_cmd /usr/local/bin/ssh_cmd\n\n```\n\nto your `/etc/pam.d/sshd` control file."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator wants to execute a script every time a user logs in via SSH, with access to the username and IP address of the person logging in.

For a null vector $X$ we now find: $$\ng(X,X) \\= 0 \\\\iff (X^0\\)^2 \\= (X^1\\)^2 \\+(X^2\\)^2 \\+(X^3\\)^2, $$\nthus the set of all null vectors at point $p$\n$$ \\\\mathcal{N}\\_p \\= \\\\{X \\\\in T\\_p M : g(X,X) \\=0 \\\\} $$\n\ngeometrically corresponds to a double cone.

We can thus conclude that $\\\\mathcal{I}\\_p$ is an open disconnected set with two components, which we denote by $\\\\mathcal{I}\\_p^\\+$ (future directed timelike vectors) and $\\\\mathcal{I}\\_p^\\-$ (past directed timelike vectors). These two open sets correspond to the two equivalence classes.\n\nThe time orientation of $M$ can now be defined as a continuous assignment of $\\\\mathcal{I}\\_p^\\+$ for all points $p$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a Lorentzian manifold (M,g) with metric signature (+,-,-,-), which of the following statements is true regarding the classification of tangent vectors and time orientation?\n\nA) There are three distinct equivalence classes for timelike vectors at each point: past-directed, future-directed, and null-directed.\n\nB) The set of all null vectors at a point forms a single cone in the tangent space.\n\nC) The interior of the solid double cone enclosed by the null vectors contains only spacelike vectors.\n\nD) A time orientation can be defined as a continuous assignment of future-directed timelike vectors for all points in the manifold.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there are only two equivalence classes for timelike vectors: past-directed and future-directed. Null vectors form their own category and are not part of these equivalence classes.\n\nB is incorrect because the set of null vectors forms a double cone, not a single cone, in the tangent space at each point.\n\nC is incorrect because the interior of the solid double cone enclosed by null vectors contains timelike vectors, not spacelike vectors. Spacelike vectors are outside this cone.\n\nD is correct. As stated in the explanation, a time orientation of M can be defined as a continuous assignment of future-directed timelike vectors (denoted as I_p^+) for all points p in the manifold.

The **`nm`** utility is used to find symbols in an object file or executable. On most systems, **`ldd`** (`otool` on macOS) shows the shared libraries used by an executable. For the former, for example, I have a script ([*`listused.sh`*](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/listused.sh)) in ncurses which lists all of the symbols in its libraries and whether those are testable by a program using the libraries (see [report](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/ab10836a5884f5ca9a8c09110ce7486a9cbad9ec/test/README#L74) in [**`test/README`**](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/README)).\n\nThe `-C` option is useful (if you're interested in C\\+\\+ libraries), but the libraries may be *stripped* (lacking debugging information). However, the **`-D`** option (available on \"recent\" systems, e.g., almost anything updated in the past 10\\-15 years) provides symbols for *dynamic* libraries:\n\n* [GNU binutils](https://github.com/gittup/binutils/blob/252b5132c753830d5fd56823373aed85f2a0db63/binutils/nm.1), since 1999\n\n> Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.

Using Dynamic Shared Objects](http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/%7Etorgerse/Kokua/More_SGI/007-2360-010/sgi_html/ch03.html) from an old SGI manual mentions that `elfdump` has a relevant option:\n\n> If you use the \\-quickstart\\_info option, ld tells you if conflicts arise.

We probably get \u201cwhinny,\u201d or horse talk, from the same root.\n> * Both words are very old; \u201cwhine\u201d dates from 1275 and \u201cwhinge\u201d from 1150\\. Originally, \u201cwhine\u201d referred merely to the sound. But \u201cwhinge\u201d implied a wailing or crying: the sound was one of distress. Eventually, to \u201cwhine\u201d also came to mean complain or express discontent.\n> * ***Though Americans use only one word, \u201cwhine,\u201d the British use both:*** \u201cwhining\u201d covers a variety of meanings, including sounds made by people, animals, or inanimate objects, and \u201cwhingeing\u201d (also spelled \u201cwhinging\u201d) is more specifically for peevish or fretful complaining.

While we find hundreds of instances of *whinge* used in U.K., Irish, and Australian news publications over the last few months, North American publications contain only a few scattered examples. Meanwhile, our American spell check catches *whinge*, our American dictionaries list it as British, and an unscientific poll we conducted suggests that some Americans have no knowledge of the word.\n> * *Whinge* is old. The OED lists examples from as far back as 1150\\. *Whing* was the preferred spelling from around the 17th century until only recently, and *whinge* now prevails by a large margin. According to an Ngram graphing the use of both spellings, this started around 1980\\.\n> * ***In either form, the word was rare until the last few decades. It has grown more common since the 1980s and in this century is almost faddish.*** As Americans, we can\u2019t explain the word\u2019s sudden popularity, so we welcome any comments from readers outside North America.\n> * to form present participles from verbs ending in \u2013ge, we usually drop the e and add \u2013ing. Whingeing is one of the few exceptions, though it\u2019s not always spelled this way; in news publications that publish online, whinging appears about a third as often as whingeing.\n\nUsage examples: \n\n> * *Croxteth Labour councillor Peter Mitchell says that, rather than whinge about cuts, the community, with the council, is simply making them work. \\[Independent]*\n> * *Needless to say the battle between these two foes plays out against the backdrop of a seething, whinging populace. \\[Sydney Morning Herald]*\n> * *\\[A]n injustice was done but no amount of crying or whingeing or appeals will change the outcome. \\[Irish Times]*\n> * *A young thief who whinged that he could not go to prison because he is a \u2018fussy eater\u2019 today had his sentence slashed by appeal judges. \\[Daily Mail]*\n> * *Attempting (unsuccessfully, for the British hate a whinger, and a Royal whinger even more) to garner sympathy, the Prince portrayed his father as a bully. \\[Daily Beast]*\n\nThe etymology of both term comes from the Old English ***hwinsian***, to whine (of dogs). \n\n***Whine*** etymology:\n\n> * Old English hwinan \"to whiz or whistle through the air\" (only of arrows), also hwinsian \"to whine\" (of dogs), ultimately of imitative origin (cf.

Listing the server publicly would almost certainly change that, but brings the risk of griefing.\n\nSo my question is: if I simply set the spawn point far enough away from where we have so far built everything (say 5,000,000 blocks away), it would take very long to reach 0,0 even by horse in the nether. I'm thinking that would be sufficient protection for our existing village, if I'm not overlooking anything. **Is there a way to bypass or overcome this distance that I am not aware of?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While it may or may not be feasible for a player to make the lengthy trek to your area, the simple fact of the matter is, **they don't have to, to grief you**. Destroying your stuff isn't the only way to grief your server\n\nAs has already been mentioned in the comments, there are things they could do to slow the whole server down; massive animal farms are an easy way, as would be a large redstone contraption that mostly just triggers a vast amount of block updates every tick. And the worst part is, if someone does try to make something like this, you'll have to actually remove it somehow; just banning the player responsible will leave the source of the lag lying around, with its chunks unloaded, and once another new player shows up and loads those chunks, the griefing will be happening all over again.\n\nAdmittedly, griefers who will do things like this are rarer than people who will just wander over to your place and trash it. And there are ways to prevent it, and/or deal with it after the fact. \n\n* You can use something like [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net/) to directly clean up the situation, even if the server is utterly crippled.\n* You can increase the spawn\\-protection value in your [server.properties](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties) file. Crank it up enough, and all new players will have to wander far enough away before they can do anything that a brand new player won't be loading potentially\\-compromised chunks.\n* You could also turn this around; leave the default spawn at (0,0\\), crank up the spawn protection enough to cover your place and a large surrounding area, and non\\-op players won't be able to damage things inside that radius.\n* You could even go more draconian, and create a wall around the default spawn, inside the spawn protection radius, so new players can't get out of it, then require an op to teleport all new players out after having a brief chat. Most griefers will give up quickly when they can't do anything, but you'll probably also lose a lot of good players if there isn't an op on pretty constantly to greet new people.\n\nUltimately, while isolating yourself from new players might be useful in preventing griefing, it's not a solution on its own. At the very least, you'd be leaving new players at the mercy of the same griefers you're trying to keep out, which could very well end up discouraging the exact sort of players you're hoping to keep around."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Minecraft server administrator wants to protect their existing village from potential griefers while still allowing new players to join.

It also isolates new players, potentially discouraging them from staying on the server.\n\nB) This is the most effective and balanced approach.

According to the research by Albert Ascherl and Robert Lang, there are \u03c3-algebras that cannot be generated by any topology. Lang's example uses the space \u03a9 = 2^R (all indicator functions on R) with a \u03c3-algebra A that has cardinality c (continuum), while any topology T that could potentially generate A would need to have cardinality at least 2^c. This mismatch in cardinalities proves that some \u03c3-algebras cannot be generated by a topology.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the existence of counterexamples disproves this general statement.

Note that in both cases the devices have a moderately small number of functional blocks (3 to 24 or so in the case of the PSoC) with somewhat limited routing options, rather than providing hundreds or thousands of blocks with enough interconnects to allow essentially arbitrary routing.\n\nOne reason that analog FPGA's don't offer anywhere near the design flexibility of digital devices is that even if one passes a digital signal through dozens or hundreds of levels of routing and logic circuitry, each of which has a 10dB signal\\-to\\-noise ratio (SNR), meaning there's 1/3 as much noise as signal, the resulting signal can be clean. By contrast, getting a clean signal from an analog device requires that every stage the signal goes through must be clean. The more complex the routing, the more difficult it is to avoid picking up stray signals.\n\nIn applications that aren't too demanding, having a small amount of analog circuitry combined into a chip can be useful. For example, I've designed a music box which uses a PSoC to drive a piezo speaker directly; the PSoC includes a DAC, a fourth\\-order low\\-pass filter, and output amplifier. It wouldn't have been hard to use a separate chip to do the filtering and amplification, but using the PSoC avoided the need for an extra chip."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the challenges and limitations of analog FPGAs compared to digital FPGAs?\n\nA) Analog FPGAs have the same design flexibility as digital FPGAs, but are more expensive to manufacture.\n\nB) Analog FPGAs have fewer functional blocks than digital FPGAs, but can handle higher frequencies.\n\nC) Analog FPGAs are limited by signal degradation through multiple stages, making complex routing difficult.\n\nD) Analog FPGAs require more power consumption than digital FPGAs, limiting their use in portable devices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

An API is a interface for defining the interactions between multiple components, modules, systems, etc. The way you expose this API is separate from how it is implemented. Having a monolith doesn't mean you expose just one API, it means that everything is built as a single, all in one solution. So one of the problem is this: if you expose two APIs from your monolith, and you make changes to one of them, when you deploy, you have to deploy the other one also because you have everything inside the same application. In a microservice architecture, you will have the APIs separated because that's the point, and you can deploy them separately.\n\n> is running multiple processes/services still considered monolithic as long as the codebase is the same and is shipped as \"one unit\"?\n\nYes. If everything is built on the same code base, using the same platform, framework, etc, and deployed as one unit, it is still a monolith. Even if you have things defined in processes or services, if you make a change to one of them, you have to deploy everything. So basically, everything is impacted by your change in just one part of the monolith.\n\nJust as an aside, even though you can build your monolith with multiple processes and services and keep the decoupled and without shared responsibilities, that's not what usually happens. Because you have everything in one place, things tend to leak from one process/service to the other and you can easily end up with one tightly coupled mess of a code base.\n\n> Does using a monolithic architecture for your web application expose its backend services? Or is it possible for a monolith to provide the web app and another API as a gateway to the internal services?\n\nHow you expose your backend services or provide APIs is your choice.

If so, the difference may be due to space used for [\"local snapshots\"](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878) (essentially, backups to the local disk when your real backup disk is not available). Local snapshots are automatically deleted when the space is needed for something else (actually, it starts purging them when the volume reaches 80% full), so the Finder treats them as free space. `du`, on the other hand, sees them as used space (as do Disk Utility and System Information).\n\nTo find out if this is what's going on, take a look in System Information: From the Apple Menu, choose \"About This Mac\", then click \"More Info\", then select the Storage tab, and look for a light purple (\"Backups\") band on the usage chart. If it's around 47GB, this is the source of the difference.\n\nIf you want to disable this feature, you can use the Terminal command `sudo tmutil disablelocal` \\-\\- but I recommend leaving it enabled, as it does provide some useful protection against accidental deletion/file damage/etc when your real backup is not available.\n\nEDIT: As @chillin pointed out, there's an additional source of confusion: `df` and the Finder are using different units to report the sizes. `df` is using Gibibytes (\\=1,073,741,824 bytes), while the Finder is using Gigabytes (\\=1,000,000,000 bytes).

An unrolled RNN tends to be a very deep network.\n2. In an unrolled RNN the gradient in an early layer is a product that (also) contains many instances of the same term.\n\nLong Version\n============\n\nTo train an RNN, people [usually use backpropagation through time (BPTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Gradient_descent), which means that you choose a number of time steps $N$, and unroll your network so that it becomes a feedforward network made of $N$ duplicates of the original network, while each of them represents the original network in another time step.\n\n[![unrolling an RNN](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlGez.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlGez.png)  \n\n(image source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time))\n\nSo BPTT is just unrolling your RNN, and then using backpropagation to calculate the gradient (as one would do to train a normal feedforward network).\n\n### Cause 1: The unrolled network is usually very deep\n\nBecause our feedforward network was created by unrolling, it is $N$ times as deep as the original RNN. Thus the unrolled network is often very deep.\n\nIn deep feedforward neural networks, backpropagation has \"the unstable gradient problem\", as Michael Nielsen explains in the chapter [Why are deep neural networks hard to train?](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap5.html#what%27s_causing_the_vanishing_gradient_problem_unstable_gradients_in_deep_neural_nets) (in his book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)):\n\n> \\[...] the gradient in early layers is the product of terms from all the later layers. When there are many layers, that's an intrinsically unstable situation. The only way all layers can learn at close to the same speed is if all those products of terms come close to balancing out.\n\nI.e. the earlier the layer, the longer the product becomes, and the more unstable the gradient becomes. (For a more rigorous explanation, see [this answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/369353/215801).)  \n\n### Cause 2: The product that gives the gradient contains many instances of the same term\n\nThe product that gives the gradient includes the weights of every later layer.  \n\nSo in a normal feedforward neural network, this product for the $d^{\\\\text{th}}$\\-to\\-last layer might look like: $$w\\_1\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{1}\\\\cdot w\\_2\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{2}\\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ \\\\cdot w\\_d\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{d}$$\nNielsen explains that (with regard to absolute value) this product tends to be either very big or very small (for a large $d$).\n\nBut in an unrolled RNN, this product would look like: $$w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{1}\\\\cdot w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{2}\\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ \\\\cdot w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{d}$$\nas the unrolled network is composed of duplicates of the same network.\n\nWhether we are dealing with numbers or matrices, the appearance of the same term $d$ times means that the product is much more unstable (as the chances are much smaller that \"all those products of terms come close to balancing out\").\n\nAnd so the product (with regard to absolute value) tends to be either exponentially small or exponentially big (for a large $d$).\n\nIn other words, the fact that the unrolled RNN is composed of duplicates of the same network makes the unrolled network's \"unstable gradient problem\" more severe than in a normal deep feedforward network."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are particularly susceptible to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem?\n\nA) RNNs have fewer parameters than feedforward neural networks, making them unstable during training.\n\nB) The unrolled structure of an RNN for backpropagation through time (BPTT) creates a very deep network with repeated weight matrices, leading to exponential products in gradient calculations.\n\nC) RNNs process sequential data, which inherently causes gradients to vanish or explode regardless of network architecture.\n\nD) The activation functions used in RNNs are fundamentally different from those in feedforward networks, causing gradient instability.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it captures two key reasons why RNNs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients:\n\n1. When unrolled for BPTT, an RNN becomes a very deep network, often much deeper than typical feedforward networks. This depth alone can cause gradient instability.\n\n2. The unrolled RNN contains many copies of the same weight matrix, unlike a standard feedforward network where each layer has different weights. This means that during backpropagation, the gradient calculation involves multiplying the same terms many times, which can lead to exponential growth or decay of the gradient.\n\nOption A is incorrect because RNNs don't necessarily have fewer parameters than feedforward networks, and having fewer parameters doesn't inherently cause gradient problems.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while RNNs do process sequential data, the vanishing/exploding gradient problem is more related to the network's architecture and training process than the sequential nature of the data itself.\n\nOption D is incorrect because RNNs typically use similar activation functions to feedforward networks. The gradient problems are not primarily caused by the choice of activation functions."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/27", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/596624", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 596624, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Question:\n\n> In this exercise one needs to determine the generalised coordinates.

Essentially you then create an electron beam. This is the basic principle of a [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube), [a cathode ray tube (tv tube)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) and an [electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope).\n\nIt is even possible to create an arc in \"vacuum\". This happens when the cathode or anode material evaporates (every material, including metals, has a non\\-zero vapor pressure) and the gas (evaporated metal) then becomes ionized and becomes conductibe. Then of course we do not have a true vacuum anymore. The message is that as long as we have electrodes in a fixed compartment we cannot have ideal vaccuum. This in turn then can even lead to arcing. This for instance happens in [vaccuum power switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_interrupter)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An experimental setup involves a vacuum chamber with two electrodes. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, electrons are observed to flow. Which of the following best explains this phenomenon and its applications?\n\nA) The electrons are spontaneously generated in the vacuum due to the high electric field, demonstrating quantum tunneling effects.\n\nB) The high voltage causes the electrodes to become superconducting, allowing for electron flow without resistance.\n\nC) Electrons are emitted from the cathode due to the applied voltage overcoming the cathode's work function, forming an electron beam. This principle is used in devices like cathode ray tubes and electron microscopes.\n\nD) The vacuum becomes ionized, creating a plasma that conducts electricity. This effect is only observed at extremely high voltages and has no practical applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied, electrons can overcome the work function of the cathode material and be emitted into the vacuum, forming an electron beam. This principle is the foundation for various technologies, including vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes (used in old TV sets), and electron microscopes. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because electrons are not spontaneously generated in a vacuum. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because superconductivity is not related to this phenomenon and doesn't occur due to high voltage application. \n\nAnswer D is partially correct in mentioning ionization, but this would occur only if there's residual gas or vaporized electrode material in the chamber.

The `\\documentclass` command specifically looks like this:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[preview, convert={density=300}]{standalone}\n\n```\n\nIf the source file is named `main.tex`, compiling it will result in producing the `main.pdf` and `main.png` files.\n\n`latexmk` runs only once the first time `main.png` is created. However, it goes into an endless loop once I begin updating the source file (and hence the `main.pdf` and `main.png`)\n\nI think this is because `latexmk` mistakes the `main.png` file as part of the source for building the final `main.pdf`.\n\nIs there a way to exclude certain files from being monitored by `latexmk`? I searched inside `man latexmk` but there are no occurrences of \"exclude\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can reproduce this with `latexmk 4.35`. The issue is that the created `png` file contains date\\+time created meta\\-information which changes on every run, and `latexmk` thinks the `png` file is part of the input, not output. I cannot think of an appropriate regular expression for `$hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'png'}` to really solve this at the right level since `png`s are binary files.\n\nHowever, I can help you to get `latexmk` to ignore the generated `png` file. The reason why `latexmk` thinks the `png` file is an input to your document is that in `standalone.cls`, there are commands like `\\IfFileExists{\\outfile` with various forms of file extensions to detect if conversion succeeded. Therefore, as far as `pdflatex` knows, you are reading that file during the run, but it knows nothing about you writing the file as it is done externally to the TeX engine. This information that `pdflatex` has is picked up by `latexmk` through the `recorder` feature. Disabling the `recorder` feature (by adding `-recorder-` to the `latexmk` options) means `latexmk` becomes ignorant of the `png` file and cannot therefore rerun when it changes. I am not aware of any feature in `latexmk` that allows you to specify an 'ignore dependants' list within which you could specifically name the output `png` file.\n\nAlso, from the `standalone` manual:\n\n> `standalone` executes the same LaTeX compiler (e.g. `pdflatex`) again as a sub\\-process which compiles the current document fully. This is done when the standalone class is loaded, so that the main compiler instance is still at `\\documentclass` and has not yet itself opened the output file for writing. After the document got compiled using the sub\\-process the external conversion tool will be executed. If required intermediate conversions like `dvips` are also executed beforehand. Finally the main compiler run is terminated without producing any output, keeping the output file generated by the sub\\-process intact. A drawback of this implementation is that the `log` file created by the sub\\-process is overwritten by the main process and does not hold meaningful information. This can be compensated by setting a different `jobname` for the sub\\-process using the `subjobname` conversion setting.\n\nNote this refers to running `pdflatex` on the subjob, not `latexmk`! As `latexmk` is reliant on the information in the `log` file, we should follow the suggestion of using a different jobname for the sub\\-process.\n\nThere are therefore two steps which together seem to workaround the problem at this stage:\n\n* Use the `subname` option to the `convert` settings in `standalone`.\n* Pass the `-recorder-` option to `latexmk` to disable the `recorder` feature of `pdflatex` (so the generated `png` file is not identified as a dependant).\n\nMWE (called `converttest.tex` for the command line given below):\n\n```\n\\documentclass[preview, convert={density=300,subjobname=\\jobname-converted}]{standalone}\n\\begin{document}\n    Hello.\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n`latexmk` command line: `latexmk -pdf -shell-escape -recorder- \"converttest\"`\n\nThen, change the TeX file, perhaps changing `Hello` to `Hello world` and re\\-run the same `latexmk` command\\-line. Things work if `-recorder-` is used but not otherwise. But now remember that the output image has a different filename (`-converted` is appended)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the standalone package with conversion to PNG and latexmk for compilation, which combination of the following actions would most likely resolve the issue of latexmk entering an endless loop upon updating the source file?\n\nA) Add the -recorder option to latexmk and use the subname option in the standalone class\nB) Remove the density option from the standalone class and use a different jobname for the main file\nC) Add the -recorder- option to latexmk and use the subjobname option in the convert settings of the standalone class\nD) Increase the density in the convert settings and use the --shell-escape option with latexmk\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it addresses two key issues mentioned in the documentation:\n\n1.

Since the cosine has a unique fixed point $x\\_0$ (such that $\\\\cos x\\_0\\=x\\_0$), it should be a fixed point of $f$. And f should be injective and hence monotone (increasing or decreasing) in a neighborhood of $x\\_0$.

You can describe them in terms of orbits of iterations of $\\\\cos x$, but I doubt this would count as a solution of the equation.\n\nUPDATE: Here is how to construct a solution (this is technical and I might overlook something).\n\nLet X be an infinite set and $g:X\\\\to X$ is a map, I am looking for a sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution of $f\\\\circ f\\=g$. Define the following equivalence relation on $X$: $x$ and $y$ are equivalent iff $g^n(x)\\=g^m(y)$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$. Equivalence classes will be referred to as orbits (the term is wrong but I don't know what is a correct one). Two orbits are said to be similar is there is a bijection between them commuting with $g$. If $Y$ and $Z$ are two similar orbits, one can define $f$ on $Y\\\\cup Z$ as follows: on $Y$, $f$ is that bijection to $Z$, and on $Z$, $f$ is the inverse bijection composed with $g$.\n\nSo if the orbits can be split into pairs of similar ones, we have a desired $f$. Now remove from the real line the fixed point of cos and all its roots ($\\\\pi/2$ and the like). Then, if I am not missing something, in the remaining set $X$ all orbits of $\\\\cos$ are similar, so we can define $f$ as above. Define $f$ so that $0$ has a nonempty pre\\-image (that is, the orbit containing $0$ should be used as $Z$ and not as $Y$). Finally, map the fixed point of $\\\\cos$ to itself, and the roots of $\\\\cos$ to some pre\\-image of $0$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the functional equation f(f(x)) = cos(x).

This is because:\n1. The cosine function has a unique fixed point x_0 where cos(x_0) = x_0.\n2. This x_0 would need to be a fixed point of f as well.\n3. f would need to be injective and thus monotone (increasing or decreasing) near x_0.\n4. This would make f(f(x)) increasing near x_0, while cos(x) is not.\n\nHowever, the equation does have discontinuous solutions. These solutions are numerous (2^R, where R is the set of real numbers) and can be constructed using the following method:\n1. Remove the fixed point of cos and all its roots from the real line.\n2. In the remaining set, all orbits of cos are similar.\n3. Define f by pairing similar orbits and creating bijections between them.\n4. Ensure that 0 has a non-empty pre-image.\n5.

The Peltier I am using is the TES1\\-12706 or TEC1\\-12706 (12v 60Watt)\n\nThank you so much, I mainly want to see if you guys think this would work, or I need to get a lower powered Peltier to be on the safe side, also I want you guys to tell me if that Ohm's Law conversion is correct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a much more [readable datasheet](http://www.thermonamic.com/TEC1-12706-English.pdf) for the TEC1\\-12706\n\nWhat can be easily said is that you **are unlikely to be able to** run both the Peltier and a fan on a power supply that can only deliver 2\\.4 A. This will depend on how accurately the battery pack shuts off on overcurrent of course, but assuming it's accurately measuring the current it won't work. \nYou need a power supply that will deliver at least 3 A if you don't want to regulate the voltage going to the Peltier. \n\nThe effective resistance of the Peltier module depends on temperature (both absolute and differential). The Peltier effective resistance for this module has a positive temperature coefficient, as the absolute temperature goes up, so does the effective resistance. The datasheet shows performance data using a constant current with variable voltage with the Hot side at a specified temperature.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkoL4.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkoL4.png)\n\nYou are wanting to feed the module with a constant 5 V ...so I marked it on the performance curve.\n\nThis graph shows T(hot) as 27 degC and we can consider this to be ambient temperature for this exercise. \n\nNow consider the points I marked:\n\n1. When you first turn the unit on there is no temperature difference between the hot side and the cold side, both are at 27 DegC (a balmy 80 Deg F). From the graph we can derive that you may draw about 2\\.5 Amps (halfway between the green and purple line). The effective resistance is about 2 Ohms.\n2. At point 2, as the temperature on the cold side is reduced by 20 degC (and assuming our fan on the hot side keeps it at ambient, 27 DegC), the cold side temperature is about 7 DegC ...this is 20 DegC less than the hot side. The current at this point is about 2 Amps. The effective resistance about 2\\.5 Ohms.\n3. At point 3, the cold side is at about \\-3 DegC (30 DegC less than the hot side). The current is about 1\\.8 Amps. The effective resistance about 2\\.8 Ohms.\n\nFrom the above you can see that the effective resistance varies with temperature, and how great a differential temperature can be maintained depends on the thermal losses in your mechanical design.\n\nIt's unlikely that you will be able to maintain the hot side at 27 DegC. If the ambient temperature varies and the hot side temperature varies then you have to work out what the effective resistance might be from the curves given.\n\nNotice in the datasheet that it shows a separate performance curve where the hot side is at 50 DegC (about as hot as the hand can tolerate). Notice also that the current flows have gone down (with a constant 5 V input) compared to those at 27 DegC. \n\nThe bad news is that as the ambient temperature drops to say 15\\.5 DegC (60 F) you can expect the current when you first turn the unit on (hot \\= cold side temp) to be MORE than at 27 DegC. Projecting the data given, I'd expect the turn on current to be very close to 3 A @ 15\\.5 DegC (60 DegF) ambient.\n\nThe only really viable solution is to measure the current and adjust the voltage to hold the current maxima at your desired level. \n\nDatasheets for modules\n\nThermonamic have a full set of [datasheets](http://www.thermonamic.com/pro_view.asp?id=806) and the TEC1\\-12704 does seem closer to a reasonable choice for you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a portable cooling system using a Peltier element (TEC1-12706) and a small fan, powered by a 5V, 2.4A max output battery pack.

The documentation indicates that the Peltier element's current draw varies significantly with temperature conditions. At lower ambient temperatures (around 15.5\u00b0C or 60\u00b0F), the initial current draw could approach 3A, which exceeds the battery pack's 2.4A max output. Additionally, the fan requires some current (around 0.4A), further exceeding the power supply's capacity. The system is unlikely to work reliably with the given power supply, especially considering temperature variations. Answer A is incorrect because it underestimates the potential current draw. C is unrealistic as ambient temperatures vary, and D is false because the Peltier's performance changes with temperature differentials."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/11", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/159373", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/19049/"], "docs_id": 159373, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any application that give me the temperature of each switches on my network?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some high end switches include temperature sensors.

I have studied a bit of [Norton's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton%27s_theorem) to get my equivalent current source and I have tested it with the INIC, but the results were just equivalent to having my coil short circuited, which means the equivalent resistance was the internal resistance (Rs) of my coil (or near it). \n\nSo is it even possible to reduce my coil's internal resistance without changing it, just using electronics? I have seen there are another options like [gyrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrator), but I would not like to lose more time to just discover it won't work. \n\nHopefully you will be able to help me and if you think I should improve my question just ask for more details.\n\nThanks! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: I think you would be best off using a different design of coil, but if you want a direct answer to the question you asked:\n\n**Immerse the coil in liquid nitrogen.**\n\nThis will reduce its resistance by a factor of 70 or so. The coil will also stay cold and low resistance for a few minutes after draining away the nitrogen, if the presence of the liquid would interfere with your experiment.\n\nThis is very much a one\\-off solution, you wouldn't want to build a product with it, but it sounds like this is a one off experiment, so it might work for you. \n\nNote that liquid nitrogen is a somewhat dangerous substance. It can cause severe burns, it can cause remarkably large explosions if stored in sealed vessels, and if you use/spill a lot at once you can drown in the resulting nitrogen gas.

This method can reduce the coil's resistance by a factor of about 70, which is a significant improvement. Although it requires careful handling due to the dangers of liquid nitrogen, it's a viable solution for a one-off experiment.\n\nD) While gyrators can be used to modify circuit characteristics, they are not specifically mentioned as a solution for reducing coil resistance in the given context.

For efficiency you'll want to gather multiple events for a single update, and you may need to reduce the events in some way (for example, you may have multiple events for a product but only care about the latest).\n\nIn this case separate streams make more sense. You *could* write your consumers to simply discard events that they don't care about. However, you have a fixed bandwidth per reads: 5 transactions or 2MB per second per shard. It's really easy to use up this bandwidth just with consumers that care about all of the records; discarding records could make your system unacceptably laggy (or could push you toward fan\\-out implementations, which you'd find even more complex to manage).\n\n**A consumer consumes multiple event types, in batches**\n\nThis case is similar to the previous, but assumes some sort of inter\\-relatedness between the event types. For example, you want to combine different types of events in a single transaction.\n\nIn this case it might make sense to combine the streams, and rely on related data being written together. In practice, it's way too easy for the shards to get out of sync, meaning that you're buffering data and you have long waits to save offsets.

We get an infinite series consisting of ever growing number of $\\\\Sigma$ and $g^0$ in the integral. This equation basically tells us: a particle enters the system, it can propagate freely and thus scatter back into itself (by way of $g^0$) or it can interact via $V$ once at time $t\\_1$, and then again propagate freely, or multiple times at times $t\\_1, t\\_2$ and so forth.

It is important because knowing it allows us to have the fully dressed single particle Green function, and usually transport involves terms related to this Green function (as physically in transport we scatter particles from one end and see how they come out at the other end of the sample).\n\nIt turns out that this is not enough, however, for some transport problems, as the interaction term itself has corrections. These are the vertex corrections mentioned. In diagrams, a vertex is an interaction term, so not a single\\-particle Green function, but a term that connects Green functions. It too is being affected by interactions and goes renormalization. In transport we (sometimes) need also the vertex corrections as well since they directly go into the expression for the transport.\n\nBoth the self\\-energy and the vertex corrections are results of interactions in the theory, and usually we calculate them numerically or perturbatively.\n\n$^\\*$ I am making here some simplifying assumption for the sake of clarity, like that the interactions are only localized in time, or that the relevant fully dressed GF is the one particle one etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In quantum field theory, what is the significance of the self-energy of a particle in relation to transport phenomena?\n\nA) It represents all possible ways a particle can interact with itself, but has no direct impact on transport calculations.\n\nB) It is used to calculate the bare (free-theory) single particle Green function.\n\nC) It allows the calculation of the fully dressed single particle Green function, which is often involved in transport-related terms.\n\nD) It only matters for quantum mechanics and has no relevance in real-world applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The self-energy of a particle in quantum field theory represents all the connected irreducible diagrams that start and end with that particle, essentially summing up all the ways a particle can scatter back into itself in the system.
