However after going through some of the basic ideas, I encountered a problem.  \n\nIf I did my homework well, there is a statement, \"**mass tells the space\\-time how to curve and curvatures in the space\\-time tell mass how to move**\".  \n\nAlso, in every video they represent the 4\\-D space\\-time as a 2\\-D flat surface. They put mass over there and the flat surface bends.  \n\nBut, it's the gravity that bends that 2\\-D flat surface when mass is placed over there (*analogous to mass in 4\\-D space\\-time*). This creates confusion as gravity is needed prior to the placement of mass in the space\\-time in\\-order to bend it. But, they say gravity doesn't exist without mass.   \n\nTo make the problem more clear let's place \"the 2\\-D flat representation of space\\-time\" in outer space (*where gravity is absent, ISS will work*). Then, keep a massive object (*say an iron ball*) over the flat surface. Here, the flat surface does not produce any curvatures (*in absence of gravity*).  \n\n**Is this approach of visualizing space\\-time \"wrong\"?

Choose such a map by picking each of the digits of each integer uniformly at random from $\\\\{ 0, 1, ..., p\\-1 \\\\}$; this is the same as using the additive Haar measure on $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N, (\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N)$. With probability $1$, this map does not have determinant $0$, so its cokernel is a finite abelian $p$\\-group. Let $\\\\mu\\_N$ be the probability measure on isomorphism classes of abelian $p$\\-groups which assigns each $p$\\-group the probability that it arises as this cokernel.\n\nThe Cohen\\-Lenstra distribution is the limit as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ of $\\\\mu\\_N$. As shown in several of the references you link to, it is given by the formula\n$$\\\\lim\\_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mu\\_N(G) \\= \\\\frac{1}{ \\|\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\|} \\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\infty} (1\\-1/p^i) .$$\n\nFor notational convenience, it will help to distinguish between the domain and range of a map in $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N, (\\\\mathbb{Z}\\_p)^N)$. I will call the former $U^N$ and the latter $V^N$.\n\n---\n\nNow, to answer your question. Let $A$ be a fixed finite abelian $p$\\-group. Let $e\\_N(A)$ be the expected number of surjections from an abelian $p$\\-group $G$, picked according to measure $\\\\mu\\_N$, to $A$. Ignoring issues about interchanging limits, we want to show that $\\\\lim\\_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} e\\_N(A)\\=1$.\n\nLets start by considering $H\\_N(A) :\\= \\\\mathrm{Hom}(V^N, A)$. The set $H\\_N(A)$ has cardinality $\\|A\\|^N$, as any map is specified by giving the image of a basis for $V^N$. Inside this set, let $S\\_N(A)$ be the surjective maps and $C\\_N(A)$ the nonsurjective maps.\n\nFor any map $f \\\\in S\\_N(A)$, let's consider the possibility that it extends to the cokernel of a random map $U^N \\\\to V^N$. This will occur if and only if the $N$ generators of $U^N$ land in the kernel of $f$. Since $f$ is in $S\\_N(A)$, its kernel has index $\\|A\\|$. So the probability that $U^N$ is mapped into the kernel of $f$ is $1/\\|A\\|^N$. \n\nWe want to compute\n$$e\\_N(A) \\= \\|S\\_N(A)\\| \\\\cdot (1/\\|A\\|^N) \\= 1 \\- \\|C\\_N(A)\\|/A^N.$$\n\nIf $A$ can be generated by $r$ elements, then $\\|C\\_N(A)\\|/A^N \\\\leq (1\\-1/\\|A\\|^r)^{\\\\lfloor N/r \\\\rfloor}$, so the second term drops out as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$. (To see this bound, group the basis elements of $V^N$ into $N/r$ groups of size $r$; the probability that these $r$ basis elements are not sent to the $r$ generators of $A$ is $(1\\-1/\\|A\\|^r)$. This bound is probably much weaker than the true rate of convergence.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided content:\n\nQuestion: According to the Cohen-Lenstra measure on abelian p-groups, what is the limit of the expected number of surjections from a randomly chosen abelian p-group G to a fixed finite abelian p-group A as N approaches infinity?\n\nA) The limit approaches 0\nB) The limit approaches 1\nC) The limit approaches infinity\nD) The limit depends on the size of A\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question is based on the key result discussed in the provided text.

Sam Jones in the early 1890s, would clear up any mystery about the underlying metaphor:\n\n> Sam Jones says, throw a stone into a crowd of dogs, and the hit dog will holler.\n> \n> \n> Quoted from [an article in *The Ozark Banner\\-Advertiser* (Ozark, Alabama)\n> 31 Aug 1893](https://www.newspapers.com/image/262408653/?terms=%22hit%2Bdog%2Bwill%2Bholler%22) (paywalled).\n\nThe \"authorized\" version of the [1885](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015063595501&view=1up&seq=290&q1=%22dog%22) *Sermons and Sayings* reproduces Jones's original more faithfully than the 1893 popular press paraphrase:\n\n> If I throw a stone into a crowd of dogs, and one\n> runs yelping, you know that is the one that is hit.\n> When you hear one of these fellows on the street\n> yelping at me, you may know he is the dog that is hit.\n\nThe underlying metaphor is that *an accusation or unflattering description* (the 'stone') made about the individuals in *a group of less\\-than entirely respectable people* (the 'crowd of dogs') will get *a response* (the 'holler') from whichever of those people are so accurately described or accused (the 'hit dog').\n\nWhile the dog may holler, the Rev. Jones did not hesitate to advocate against the throwing of the stone in the first place, with this bit of advice quoted in\nthe [*El Paso Times* (Texas; paywalled), 01 Jan 1893](https://www.newspapers.com/image/429218843/?terms=%22sam%2Bjones%22):\n\n> \"Quit your meanness,\" is one of Sam Jones' sensible bits of advice to men."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the original context and meaning of the phrase \"A hit dog will holler\" according to the explanation given?\n\nA) It refers to a literal situation where throwing stones at dogs causes them to yelp in pain.\n\nB) It's a metaphor for how guilty people react defensively when accused of wrongdoing in a group setting.\n\nC) It's an idiom used to describe how Southern hunting dogs bark when they successfully catch their prey.\n\nD) It's a saying that means accusations always hurt innocent people the most.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"A hit dog will holler\" originates from a metaphor used by evangelical revivalist Rev. Sam Jones in the 1890s. He described throwing a stone into a crowd of dogs, where the dog that yelps is the one that was hit. This metaphor represents how, when an accusation or unflattering description (the 'stone') is made about individuals in a group of less-than-entirely respectable people (the 'crowd of dogs'), the person who responds defensively (the 'holler') is likely the one to whom the accusation accurately applies (the 'hit dog'). Thus, the phrase is used to suggest that a defensive reaction to an accusation often indicates guilt or that the accusation has some truth to it."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/06", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/404324", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/21068/"], "docs_id": 404324, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was going through this [lecture note](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~ldeldebb/docs/QM/lect12.pdf) in 1D harmonic oscillator.

It seems to be a general view that resistance has to be constant for Ohm's Law to be obeyed, but I don't understand why this is and how this is implied from the equation. Why can't the equation just be said to link three *variables*?\n\nHere are my thoughts: this equation is, in some ways, analogous to $s\\=vt$ (where $s$ is distance, $v$ is velocity and $t$ is time). We may need to use calculus to find $v$ if it is not constant, just as we may need to use calculus to find $R$ if it is not constant. (I understand that $\\\\frac {dV}{dI}$ is known as dynamic resistance, but do not understand why we can't just call it resistance). The difference I see with $s\\=vt$ is that distance cannot be seen as an instantaneous property, so we cannot say that $s\\=vt$ always applies. However, it seems to me that voltage and current are instantaneous properties, so at any instant in time why can we not say that $V\\=IR$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The equation:\n$$\\\\frac{dV}{dI} \\= R$$\nis a definition of $R$. Ohm's law is the statement that $R$ is constant over all voltages and currents (with $I \\= 0$ when $V \\= 0$), thereby giving:\n$$V \\= IR$$\n\nWith this definition, it is all but impossible to say $V \\= IR$ for any electrical component other than Ohmic resistors. Consider the Shockley equation: $$I \\= I\\_0(e^{aV}\\-1\\)$$ which describes an ideal diode. We have $$R \\= \\\\frac{dV}{dI} \\= \\\\frac{1}{aI} \\\\ne \\\\frac{V}{I}$$\n\nYou can, of course, go ahead and define $R' \\= \\\\frac{V}{I}$ as your resistance. However, the major advantage of the original definition, small\\-signal analysis (i.e. that small changes in voltages or currents may be treated as if a circuit is linear and approximately obeys Ohm's law for these changes) is lost when using $R'$.\n\nFor example, going back to the diode, if we know that $I(V\\_1\\) \\= I\\_1$, and we want the change in current $\\\\Delta I\\_1$ for a small change in the applied voltage: $V\\_1 \\\\rightarrow V\\_1 \\+ \\\\Delta V\\_1$, we can approximately write:\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V\\_1}{\\\\Delta I\\_1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{dV}{dI}(V\\_1\\)$$\nor $$\\\\Delta I\\_1 \\\\approx aI\\_1\\\\Delta V\\_1 \\= R \\\\Delta V\\_1$$\n\nThis means that you can effectively treat the diode as a resistor of resistance $R \\= aI\\_1$ for all 'small signals' added to the circuit over a given 'operating point'. This greatly simplifies the analysis of complex networks with diodes. The quantity $R'$ is of little use in such cases."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student is analyzing the behavior of a diode using the Shockley equation: I = I\u2080(e^(aV) - 1).

Which of the following statements is correct regarding this analysis?\n\nA) The small-signal resistance should be calculated using R' = V/I at the operating point.\nB) The small-signal resistance is constant for all voltages and currents across the diode.\nC) The small-signal resistance is given by R = dV/dI = 1/(aI) at the operating point.\nD) Ohm's law (V = IR) can be directly applied to find the resistance at any point.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach for small-signal analysis of a diode is to use the dynamic resistance formula R = dV/dI. For the Shockley equation, this yields R = 1/(aI) at a given operating point. This allows for linearization around the operating point, enabling simplified analysis for small changes in voltage or current. Options A and D are incorrect because they don't accurately represent the diode's behavior for small signals. Option B is false because the resistance of a diode varies with the operating point, unlike an ohmic resistor."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/06", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/75765", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/44328/"], "docs_id": 75765, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a device (a popcorn popper) that has an L14\\-20P plug.   \n\nI would like to use it with my stove's 14\\-50R receptacle.   \n\nSince the device is rated for 20 Amp, and the receptacle for 50, this should be ok, or am I overlooking something?\nAnd if it *is* ok, would the following be the correct wiring:\n\n![image](https://imgur.com/0ytfdgl.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your wiring does match up the ground, neutral, and phases, so it would supply power, and since it is a 50 amp circuit it has more than enough juice for a 20 amp appliance, but it isn't really safe.

How it works is that there's a permanent magnet on the flywheel which excites a stator coil, which is followed by a bridge rectifier. Unlike an alternator, regulation is done by measuring the output voltage and then shorting the stator coil to ground with SCRs. \n\nHow does the system convert rectified AC pulses to DC? It treats the battery as a capacitor.

Replacing the battery should be the first step.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The failing battery is the most likely root cause of both issues. In ATVs, the battery acts as a capacitor to smooth out the voltage from the simple stator generator system. When the battery fails, it can't properly filter out voltage pulses and noise, leading to poor regulation and potential overvoltages. This can damage sensitive electronics like LED lights. Additionally, the symptoms described (dimming lights, difficulty starting) are classic signs of a failing battery. Replacing the battery first is the most logical step to address both the LED failures and the starting issues before considering other potential problems or modifications."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/12", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/218582", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/55930/"], "docs_id": 218582, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My house was built in 1975 and I pretty obviously have a \"Rule of 6\" GE main panel (the meter is above this)\n\n[![Main Panel](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GR2H.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GR2H.jpg)\n\nMy father\\-in\\-law (who has taught me a great many DIY things) swears that the neutral bus here is done wrong.

In your case, this is done through the mounting of the left\\-hand bar; if you look closely at it, you'll notice that there is no insulator between it and the case, unlike the neutral bars on a typical loadcenter, which are mounted on insulators (whether they be part of the backpan the busbars are attached to, or separate standoffs)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a meter-main electrical panel from 1975, what is the correct method for bonding the neutral bar to the panel case?\n\nA) The neutral bar must always be connected to the case using a separate binding screw\nB) The neutral bar should be mounted on insulators to isolate it from the case\nC) The neutral bar can be permanently bonded to the case through its mounting, without insulators\nD) The neutral bar should only be bonded to a separate ground rod, not the panel case\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

Based on the information provided, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) Software conflict with Adobe Illustrator\nB) Outdated graphics drivers\nC) Hardware problem with the display or GPU\nD) Malware infection causing screen artifacts\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The persistent visual glitches described by the user, which occur even when specific applications like Adobe Illustrator are not running, strongly suggest a hardware issue. The fact that the glitches disappear when taking screenshots further supports this, as hardware display problems often don't appear in screenshots. The persistence of the issue and its occurrence across different scenarios point to a problem with the display hardware or the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) rather than a software conflict, driver issue, or malware infection. The age of the MacBook (2012 model) also increases the likelihood of hardware deterioration.

I expect that most of the time we'll get TikZ...but that's fine. We should perhaps have some rules regarding size or aspect ratio that should be upheld. Every week, the winning entry from the previous week takes the stage with a brief explanation, a longer one could also be accessed (along with the source code ofcourse!)\n\nThe point is that most of the entries we have, have to do with stuff that doesn't work, and we hardly get to see stuff when it works and is nicely polished. It would be really nice (I think) to have a post saying something like \"I needed this, but didn't know how to do FOO so I posted THIS question got a reply by BAZ and here's the result!\" (of course, images do not have to be the result of a posting here....)\n\nThat would only be the explanation of the typeset image, but the image itself would/could/might appear alongside the top of the page, or something like that.\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\nTo start with, and see if we even have sufficient entries for such an ongoing competition, we could leave the design alone and simple have a page dedicated for such distractions....\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That's interesting.

Of course suggestions may be repeated, especially if they just did not make it in a previous month.\n\nTeX.SE is still a Q\\&A site.

It's like the person who suggested the edit and the others who approved don't get any reputation points. We don't give reputation points to the gold badge owner or to users that can cast a close vote.

The base station could have more transmission and receiving power than the client, which should be portable (ideally, it should be light and battery powered). The data rate is very low with a 30 character string being transmitted every 10 minutes.\n\nI saw that XBee\\-PRO\u00ae 868 modules claim a range of 80\u00a0km in LOS, but in a severe environment like a wild mountain place, how well would it perform? What are the alternatives?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with any radio system the bottom line is what can be achieved without the hindrance of obstacles. In free\\-space the baseline is dependent on what frequency you transmit at and how sensitive your receiver can be. The power path loss equation is this:\n\nLoss (dB) \\= 32\\.45 \\+ 20\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(f) \\+ 20\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(d)\n\nWhere f is in MHz and d is in kilometres. This equation tells you how many dB of power loss you can expect at a given distance with a given carrier frequency.\n\nIt's formulated from work by [Harald T. Friis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_T._Friis) and a decent reference is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss). It doesn't assume any gain in the antennas, so it is a real baseline. Antenna gain brings lower path loss but greater directionality, and for a dipole the gain is about 1\\.76\u00a0dB.\n\nIf you are transmitting 10\u00a0dBm (10\u00a0mW) at 100\u00a0MHz over a distance of 10\u00a0km, you can expect to receive a power of:\n\n10\u00a0dBm \\- (32\\.45 \\+ 40 \\+ 20\\)\u00a0dBm \\= \\-82\\.45\u00a0dBm (5\\.7\u00a0nW)\n\nHow much power does your receiver need? A useful equation is this:\n\nPower (dBm) needed by a receiver is \\-154\u00a0dBm \\+ 10\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(data rate) and as you have a data rate that is quite low you can expect better performance than [Wi\\-Fi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)!\n\nThe question states 30 characters every ten minutes. I'm going to assume that this is transmitted as a burst of 30 x 10\u00a0bits in 10 seconds plus a preamble of 100 bits to get the receiver locked in \\- that's 400\u00a0bits in 10 seconds or 40\u00a0bits per second.\n\nThe receiver power required is therefore \\-154\u00a0dBm \\+ 10\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(40\\) dBm \\= \\-138\u00a0dBm\n\nThis assumes that the transmitter and receiver are bespoke items designed to run with this low data rate. It's not easy to get a receiver sensitivity below \\-120\u00a0dBm, so whatever radio system you use read the small print and investigate. Off\\-the\\-shelf items are probably incable of transmitting at very low data rates, so they should be avoided.\n\nAnyway, you need to receive \\-138\u00a0dBm and, over 10\u00a0km with a 100\u00a0MHz carrier, you can expect to receive \\-82\\.45\u00a0dBm. This sounds good enough considering that you may get a few more dBs from antenna gain. \n\nBut on earth, no matter what the terrain appears to be, there will be added attenuations that are really difficult to account for and describe here. There's a thing called fade margin and this, as a rule of thumb basically says \\- try to ensure your received power is at least 20\u00a0dB greater than its baseline sensitivity \\- this means that if you designed a receiver requiring \\-120\u00a0dBm you should expect to receive \\-100\u00a0dBm on a good day.\n\nGiven the terrain I'd hazard a wild guess that you need to have 20\u00a0dB more up your sleeve and this just about brings you to being able to get 10\u00a0km from a 10\u00a0mW transmission.\n\nHopefully you now have the formulae to work out what power you need to get 15\u00a0km. Another helpful fact is that the target may not be moving very fast and can be tracked from one end using a high gain antenna such as a [Yagi\\-Uda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna) antenna. You might have seen wild\\-life films where a bear or a puma has a radio transmitter attached to them and some guy in a field is pointing the Yagi\\-Uda antenna this way and that in order to locate the direction the animal is in. This might work to improve things."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A point-to-point communication system is being designed for a mountainous environment with a 15 km distance between the base station and client. The system uses a 100 MHz carrier frequency and transmits 30 characters every 10 minutes. The transmitter power is 10 dBm (10 mW). Given the free-space path loss equation and the required receiver sensitivity formula, what is the approximate minimum receiver sensitivity needed for this system to work reliably in this challenging environment?\n\nA) -120 dBm\nB) -100 dBm\nC) -80 dBm\nD) -60 dBm\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nTo solve this, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. Calculate the free-space path loss:\n   Loss (dB) = 32.45 + 20log\u2081\u2080(f) + 20log\u2081\u2080(d)\n   = 32.45 + 20log\u2081\u2080(100) + 20log\u2081\u2080(15)\n   \u2248 103.97 dB\n\n2. Calculate the received power without considering environmental factors:\n   Received Power = 10 dBm - 103.97 dB = -93.97 dBm\n\n3. Calculate the theoretical minimum receiver sensitivity:\n   Data rate \u2248 40 bits per second (400 bits / 10 seconds)\n   Minimum sensitivity = -154 dBm + 10log\u2081\u2080(40) \u2248 -138 dBm\n\n4. Add a fade margin of 20 dB for challenging environments:\n   -138 dBm + 20 dB = -118 dBm\n\n5. Consider the rule of thumb mentioned: try to ensure the received power is at least 20 dB greater than the baseline sensitivity.\n\nGiven the calculated received power of -93.97 dBm and the need for an additional 20 dB margin in challenging environments, the system should aim for a receiver sensitivity of around -100 dBm to work reliably. This accounts for both the fade margin and the rule of thumb for reliable communication in difficult terrain."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/18", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/190177", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 190177, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some stellar formation theories suggest that stars are formed by shock waves from trigger events such as supernovae. \n\nThis excerpt from \n[Star Formation](http://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/AT319/HTML/AT31905.HTM) basically gives the background to my question:\n\n> Many astronomers regard the passage of a shock wave through\n>  interstellar matter as the triggering mechanism needed to initiate\n>  star formation in a galaxy. Calculations show that when a shock wave\n>  encounters an interstellar cloud, it races around the thinner exterior\n>  of the cloud more rapidly than it can penetrate its thicker interior.\n>  Thus, shock waves do not blast a cloud from only one direction. They\n>  effectively squeeze it from many directions.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. If the Sun (and Solar System) was formed in this way, rather than a collapse of a cloud of dust and gas, (by itself, through gravity alone), do we have any idea of what event caused it, for example, do we know where a possible ex\\-supernovae is located, or has it long since vanished by now?\n2. Stars are often formed in groups. I wonder do we have an age for the nearest stars (using the [H\\-R diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram)) or any evidence that they may have been part of the same gas and dust cloud that formed our Sun?\n\nI do appreciate that:\n\n1. Astronomical observations are difficult in many circumstances, e.g. obscuration by dust or gas often prevents an accurate picture of objects located many light years from Earth.\n2. The Sun was formed 4,500 million years ago, this fact may make finding evidence of a possible trigger event extremely difficult to discover.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're right that the Sun being 4\\.5 billion years old makes observations difficult. The Sun goes around the Galaxy about once every 225 million years, so since the Sun formed it has gone around the Galaxy perhaps 20 times. The trouble is that the Galaxy is not like the Solar System: stars don't go around on nice nearly circular orbits, everything is a bit jumbled. To give you an idea, here's an estimate of where the stars that are currently in the Solar neighbourhood have been during the [last orbit of the Sun around the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year):\n\n![animation of some MW stellar orbits for stars now near the Sun](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8jrc.gif)\n\nAs you can see, they span over 80,000 light years (that's basically the full width of the Milky Way) just 1 orbit ago, so a supernova remnant that was near the Sun 20 orbits ago could be virtually anywhere. We can't measure the age of the Sun or supernova remnants accurately enough to help either (as in being able to say \"aha! a remnant with exactly the age of the Sun!\").\n\nIt's similarly difficult to find stars that may have formed near the Sun. About the best we can do is to look for stars with similar age and chemical composition to the Sun, but at 4\\.5 billion years old, the accuracy of stellar ages isn't terribly good. Asking more broadly what star formation conditions were like in the Milky Way when the Sun formed is also a difficult question and a topic of current research, see for instance [this reasonably current review](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:0907.0415).\n\nA potentially more fruitful approach is to look for Sun\\-like stars that are forming now and see what conditions look like for their formation \\- potential triggering mechanisms, how many stars formed in a group, etc. But this only helps inform what the formation of the Sun would have looked like \\- it's likely the Milky Way was a significantly different beast 4\\.5 billion years ago in terms of gas supply, morphology, [ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Interstellar_medium) conditions, etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information about stellar formation and the Sun's origin, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) We can precisely locate the supernova that triggered the Sun's formation by tracing its orbit backwards through the Milky Way.\n\nB) Stars currently near the Sun were likely formed from the same gas cloud, as evidenced by their similar orbits around the galactic center.\n\nC) The difficulty in determining the Sun's origin is primarily due to the lack of advanced observational technology.\n\nD) The Sun's age and the complex orbital dynamics of stars in the galaxy make it extremely challenging to identify its specific formation trigger or original stellar neighbors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The passage emphasizes that the Sun's age (4.5 billion years) and the complex orbital motions of stars in the Milky Way make it very difficult to trace back the Sun's origin or identify stars that formed with it. The Sun has orbited the galaxy about 20 times since its formation, and stars that were once near each other can end up spread across vast distances. The passage also mentions that age measurements for stars this old are not precise enough to definitively link them.

You'd still need latches or multiple ports.\n\nULN2803 can notionally sink 500 mA / line but total pkg dissipation reduces that. \n\n---\n\nThe MM5450 [datasheet here](http://www.micrel.com/_PDF/mm5450.pdf) can drive 34 LEDs. There are DIP and LCC versions. About $3\\.80 each from Digikey in quantity needed. \n\nAt max clock of 500 kHz you can update it at about 10,000 times per second. It's just on/off per LED but by running at say 100 brightness levels with N cycles on and 100\\-N off you get 1000 frames per second.\n\nFor 8x8x8 \\= 512 LEDs you'd need 512 / 34 \\= 16 ICs. These can be daisy chained. Not the ideal solution BUT it would work. May or may not have enough segment drive current for you.

Digikey sells a number of their ICs but do not list this one as yet.\n\nThey say: \n\n* The AS1130 is a compact LED driver for 132 single LEDs. The devices can be programmed via an I\u00b2C compatible interface.\n\nThe AS1130 offers a 12x11 LED\\-Matrix with 1/11 cycle rate. The required lines to drive all 132 LEDs are reduced to 12 by using the cross\\-plexing feature optimizing space on the PCB. \n\nThe whole LEDMatrix driving 132 LEDs can be analog dimmed from 1 to 30mA in 256 steps (8 bit). Additionally each of the 132 LEDs can be dimmed individually with 8\\-bit allowing 256 steps of linear dimming. \n\nTo reduce CPU usage up to 36 frames can be stored with individual time delays between frames to play small animations automatically.\n\nThe AS1130 operates from 2\\.7V to 5\\.5V and features a very low shutdown and operational current. The device offers a programmable IRQ pin. Via a register it can be set on what event (CP request, Interface timeout, Error\\-detection, POR, End of Frame or End of Movie) the IRO is triggered. Also hardware scroll Function is implemented in the AS1130\\.\n\nThe device is available in a ultrasmall 20\\-pin WL\\-CSP and an easy to solder 28\\-pin SSOP package.\n\n[Product page / General details here](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led-driver/AS1130)\n\n[Data sheet here](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/Products/Lighting-Management/LED-Driver-ICs/AS1130)\n\n[http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led\\-driver/AS1130](http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/eng/led-driver/AS1130)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A designer wants to create an 8x8x8 RGB LED cube (512 total LEDs) and is considering various driver options.

The attached photo shows the \"drop\" for one of the in\\-floor units.\n\nIs this a typical practice when a zone has multiple drops?  \n\nI can see the benefit of this, in that each successive device doesn't lower the overall temperature as much as if they were \"one out, two in\" plumbed, and this also allows for more overall flow through the system rather than being restricted by the smaller devices, but it leaves me wondering how enough water goes through the individual devices, since it seems that it would be easier to keep flowing through the larger\\-diameter main loop than taking the 1/2\" route through the baseboard or whatever.\nThe loop pipe seems to be 1\", and the drops are 1/2\" copper.

The main pipes are called the \"primary loop\" and each set of smaller piping to the radiators is called a \"secondary loop\". (The technique has been around since at least the 1950's, but it used to be limited mostly to commercial buildings. Its use in residential systems has become a lot more common in the last 20 years.)\n\nBoiler manufacturers want it done this way because the boiler is not designed to get back return water at too low a temperature. Yes, it sounds counterintuitive, I hear you thinking \\- isn't the whole point of the boiler to heat water? The problem is that if the temperature difference between the inside of the boiler and the returning water is too great, it will cause condensation inside the boiler which will ruin it.\n\nInstallers like to do it this way because it means you don't need to install lots of extra piping that would be required for a traditional \"header\\-type\" system with separate supply and return pipes.\n\nIt also means that you can turn on/off individual zones without affecting the overall system pressure too much.\n\nIf you want to know everything there is to know about Hydronic heating loops, Dan Holohan's website [HeatingHelp.com](https://heatinghelp.com) is a great place to start. Here is their article on [primary\\-secondary pumping](https://heatinghelp.com/systems-help-center/understanding-primary-secondary-pumping/).

It prevents condensation in the boiler by ensuring that the return water temperature isn't too low. This is crucial for maintaining the boiler's longevity and efficiency.\n\n2. It allows for better zone control. Individual zones can be turned on or off without significantly affecting the overall system pressure.\n\n3. It simplifies installation by reducing the amount of piping required compared to traditional header-type systems.\n\n4. It provides more consistent heating throughout the system, as each radiator or heating element receives water directly from the primary loop rather than progressively cooled water in a daisy-chain setup.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this configuration actually reduces the need for extra piping.

Two signal receivers are placed on its edge at coordinates (3, -5.2) and (-5.8, 1.4) relative to the dish's center at (0, 0). What is the angular separation between these receivers, measured in degrees?\n\nA) 78.69\u00b0\nB) 101.31\u00b0\nC) 157.38\u00b0\nD) 202.62\u00b0\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this, we need to:\n1. Calculate the angles of each point relative to the center using atan2(y, x)\n2. Subtract these angles to get the angular separation\n3. Convert radians to degrees\n\nFor point 1 (3, -5.2):\n\u03b81 = atan2(-5.2, 3) = -1.0471 radians\n\nFor point 2 (-5.8, 1.4):\n\u03b82 = atan2(1.4, -5.8) = 2.9061 radians\n\nAngular separation = \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 2.9061 - (-1.0471) = 3.9532 radians\n\nConverting to degrees: 3.9532 * (180/\u03c0) = 226.31\u00b0\n\nHowever, this is the larger angle. We want the smaller angle, which is:\n360\u00b0 - 226.31\u00b0 = 133.69\u00b0\n\nThe closest option is 101.31\u00b0, which is answer B.\n\nNote: The exact answer isn't provided, but B is the closest and most reasonable given the setup of the problem."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/21", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/107178", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/37444/"], "docs_id": 107178, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to fix my header for my magento site.

Which combination of steps would correctly implement this functionality?\n\nA) Add a <script> tag in header.phtml, use vanilla JavaScript to detect scroll position, and apply a 'fixed-menu' class using getElementById()\n\nB) Add a <script> tag in footer.phtml, use jQuery to detect scroll position, apply a 'fixed-menu' class to '#header', and include corresponding CSS for the 'fixed-menu' class\n\nC) Add a <style> tag in header.phtml with position: sticky for the header, and use jQuery to toggle a class based on scroll position\n\nD) Use Magento's built-in XML layout updates to add a fixed header, without needing any JavaScript or additional CSS\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is B, which aligns with the provided documentation. This solution uses jQuery (with noConflict to avoid conflicts) to detect the scroll position. When the scroll height exceeds 150px, it adds a 'fixed-menu' class to the '#header' element. The CSS for 'fixed-menu' is also included, setting the header to a fixed position with a high z-index to ensure it stays on top. This method is added to either header.phtml or footer.phtml, making B the most accurate and complete solution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery and doesn't include the necessary CSS.\nOption C is partially correct but misses key elements and incorrectly suggests using position: sticky.\nOption D is incorrect as Magento doesn't have a built-in feature for this specific functionality without custom JavaScript and CSS."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/27", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/240859", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/36633/"], "docs_id": 240859, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I Tex this equation?\n\n![figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t9CGf.png)\n\nI try to have exactly the same result but for the moment I only succeeded in having intersecting lines...
