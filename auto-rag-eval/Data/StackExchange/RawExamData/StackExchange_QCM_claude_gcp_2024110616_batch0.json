However, I don't get immediate feedback. Instead, I connect to wi\\-fi. However, wi\\-fi is both slower and less reliable than ethernet. Thus, I'd like to know whether I am connected to ethernet or not. Of course I can go into preferences and network settings to see whether I'm connected to ethernet, but it would be better if there was some form of indicator in the status bar, just as there is for wi\\-fi.\nThus, my question:\n\n**Is there a way of getting an indicator of ethernet connectivity in the OSX menu\\-bar?**\n\nPerhaps there is a free application that can do this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is Menumeters:\n\n* [menumeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) for OSX 10\\.10 and earlier\n* The port of [menumeters for OSX 10\\.11 onwards](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/).\n\nIf you go into the preferences for MenuMeters it is possible to add a network icon to the OSX menu bar.\nClicking on the icon, indicates the current network (i.e., wifi or Ethernet).\n\nThis is a reasonable solution, but it still requires you to click on the icon to see whether ethernet is connected."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is working on optimizing network connectivity for a Mac application used in various professional environments.

This method allowed for quick georeferencing using only the four corner points of the map, resulting in an error below 10 meters.

But the net allocates over 1GB of RAM when I train it. What is all that memory needed for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I found out some of the factors that may contribute to the effect.\n\n1\\) At least in tiny\\-cnn, some of the buffers are allocated not once but once per **worker thread**. On a machine with **8** CPU threads, this can increase the memory usage a lot.\nIn debug mode using MS VC\\+\\+ 2015 the following two lines in the code base allocate a big chunk, both related to worker threads: [`ith_in_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L481) and [`ith_out_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L485).\n\n2\\) Additionally to the values for the neurons and weights listed in my question, also gradients and some other stuff for the backward passes and the optimization have to be stored.\n\n3\\) Not sure if this is relevant fot tiny\\-cnn, but many frameworks seem to use an operation called **im2col**. This makes the convolution much faster, by expressing it as a matrix multiplication. But in case of filters with 3\\*3 in height and width, this scales the number of values from the input to a convolution up by a factor of **9**.\nJustin Johnson explains it in the lecture [\"S231n Winter 2016 Lecture 11 ConvNets in practice\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue4RJdI8yRA) starting at 36:22\\.\n\n4\\) There was an **error in my initial calculation**. When a volume of 512\\*512\\*3 is convolved with 6 3\\*3 filters and then send into an average pooling layer, the result volume is 256\\*256\\*6, but in between it is 512\\*512\\*6, also contributing with a factor of **2**.\n\n5\\) There was **another error in my initial calculation**. I demonstrate it on the last conv layer (7\\). It takes a volume of 16\\*16\\*96 to a volume of 8\\*8\\*192 with filters of size 3\\*3\\. This means every filter has 3\\*3\\*96 weights, and there are 192 of them, resulting in 165888 (3\\*3\\*96\\*192\\) weights overall for this layer, not 6912\\.\n\nSo numerologically multiplying only the first three factors (8, 9 and 2\\) we end up with a factor of 144, which seems enough to explain the high memory consumption."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A machine learning engineer is optimizing a convolutional neural network for image processing on a resource-constrained edge device.

The documentation highlights several factors contributing to high memory usage, including worker thread allocations, gradients storage, im2col operations, and intermediate feature map sizes.\n\n2. Option A addresses worker thread allocations, which is a valid concern, but reducing threads could significantly impact performance and may not be the most effective solution.\n\n3. Option B attempts to eliminate im2col operations, but this would fundamentally change the network architecture and likely reduce its effectiveness.\n\n4. Option C targets the issue of intermediate feature map sizes. By increasing the stride in early layers, we reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps throughout the network. This addresses both the direct memory usage of storing these maps and the cascading effect on subsequent layers, including the impact on im2col operations. It's the most effective option for reducing memory while potentially maintaining most of the network's computational efficiency.\n\n5. Option D proposes using half-precision floats, which would reduce memory usage but doesn't address the architectural inefficiencies and may introduce precision issues.\n\nThe correct answer, C, requires understanding the network architecture, the concept of feature map sizes, and how they propagate through the network. It also requires critical thinking about the trade-offs between memory usage and computational efficiency.

The point cloud I'm testing against is very big (\\~800\\.000\\). However, this doesn't really explain why my implementation is so slow. This is my approach:\n\nFirst, I created a spatial index for the point shape \n\n`pntshp.ExecuteSQL('CREATE SPATIAL INDEX ON %s' % table_name)`\n\nI defined an array of buffer distances to narrow down the search radius. Which of course also means that I have to create a buffer for each point (which might be expensive). \n\n`BUFFER_DISTANCES = ( 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 ) # 100m, 500m, 1km, 2km, 5km` \n\nThen, the buffer is used as a spatial filter \n\n`node_lyr.SetSpatialFilter(buff)`\n\nIf the filter returns `None` the buffer distance will be increased. \n\n```\nfor buffer_d in BUFFER_DISTANCES:\n    buffr = get_buffer(xy_street,buffer_d)\n    ...\n\n```\n\nThen I am calculating the distance to the points returned by the spatial filter\n\n```\np=ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)\np.AddPoint(xy[0],xy[1])\n\nfor feat in node_lyr:\n    geom = feat.GetGeometryRef()\n    d = p.Distance(geom)\n    dist.append(d)       \n\n```\n\nTo get the closest point:\n\n```\ndef get_closest_pnt(dist, node, how_close):\n    mrg = zip(dist,node)\n    mrg.sort(key=lambda t: t[0])\n    try:\n        return mrg[how_close]\n    except IndexError, ierr:\n        print '%s \\ndist/node tuple contain %s' % (ierr,mrg)\n\n```\n\nIt all works fine but is really slow. Creating a spatial index didn't show any effect, really. To calculate 100 points this implementations takes \\~6,7 seconds. The program needs to be able to calculate the closest location for more than 2000 points as fast as possible. Any ideas on how to improve my approach? \n\n**EDIT**\n\nI tried different approaches to see where it gets me. I came across something very astonishing I want to share here. \n\nI implemented a simple lookup algorithm as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19154296/python-how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-a-set-the-fast-way), and one of the solutions that where suggested (the sorted set approach). \n\nThe surprising fact is that performance is not only dependent on the implementation but even more so of the OSX. My original ogr/buffer algorithm turns out to be blazing fast on my OSX whereas it is painstaking slow on Linux (hence the question here). \n\nHere are my results (100 runs). \n\n```\nMethod       |     OSX        |  Linux Ubuntu\nogr buffer   | 0:00:01.434389 | 0:01:08.384309\n\nsub string   | 0:00:19.714432 | 0:00:10.048649\n\nsorted set   | 0:00:01.239999 | 0:00:00.600773\n\nSpecs Mac OSX\nProcessor 4x2.5 GHz  \nMemory 8 GB 1600 MHz\n\nSpecs Dell Linux Ubuntu\nProcessor 8x3.4GHz\nMemory 7.8 GB\n\n```\n\nIf someone can explain why these differences occur, please don't hesitate. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Avoiding the spatial query**\n------------------------------\n\nSince you noted buffering is computationally expensive and may be holding you back, consider this approach: Start looping through each point and round off your lat long point to a decimal place within your buffer (i.e. if your lat/long is 12\\.3456789/12\\.3456789 then get all points that begin with a lat/long of 12\\.34567/12\\.34567 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34567/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34567\\). Use a [hash table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to do this. Take this subset of points, get all distances to your input point, and the point with minimum distance is the one you want. Creating a lookup methodology will make this very efficient.\n\nThis avoids having to do expensive spatial queries and query filter setup 800,000 times. You would only be doing string/double comparisons and distance calculations in this method. The only downside that I could see to this method is that each decimal roundoff is an order of magnitude above the last, so if your spatial query didn't return any points, rounding down again may return many more points than you need, which would slow you down a bit. However, you have at least two orders of magnitude in your orignal BUFFER\\_DISTANCES, so I think this method may suffice for your purposes and would certainly be faster than the method you have going right now.\n\n**The hash table:**\n-------------------\n\n[Here's](http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/algorithms/hash/article.php/c5131/Introduction-to-Hash-Tables.htm) a more concise and better introductory explanation to hash tables. \n\nThe concept is like so: You want to look up the definition for the word \"Yes\" in the dictionary. You don't look through every word in a dictionary starting from A to find the words that start with Ye, correct? You jump straight to the Y section first, then you look for the page that says Ye\\-Yo and then you scan all the words on that page to get the definition for Yes.\n\nThe lookup methodology to loop through all the lat/long points would be implemented in this same fashion.

The correct answer, B, is based on the top answer's suggestion of using a hash table-based lookup method. This approach addresses several key issues:\n\n1. It avoids expensive spatial queries and buffer creation, which were identified as potential bottlenecks in the original implementation.\n2. It uses efficient data structures (hash tables) for quick lookups, which is likely to perform well across different operating systems.\n3.

The proposed theorem is actually a valid extension of Rolle's Theorem, but determining the specific value of m is not possible with the given information.\n\nTo see why the theorem is valid, consider the function g(x) = f(x) - kx/(b-a). This function satisfies g(a) = f(a) and g(b) = f(b) + k - k = f(b). Therefore, g(a) = g(b), and g(x) satisfies all conditions of the original Rolle's Theorem.

The current implementation, while functional for small-scale use, has several limitations that become problematic as the application grows:\n\n1. Concurrency: The file-based system doesn't handle simultaneous read/write operations well. As the developer mentioned, they \"never encountered issues with a file being edited at the same time,\" but this is likely due to low concurrent usage. As the application scales, race conditions and data corruption become real risks.\n\n2. Atomic operations: The current system reads the entire file, modifies it in memory, and then writes it back. This process is not atomic and could lead to data loss if interrupted.\n\n3. Scalability: As data grows, reading and writing entire files for each operation becomes inefficient.\n\n4. Data integrity: MySQL provides features like transactions, constraints, and referential integrity that are difficult to implement in a file-based system.\n\nWhile options A and B address aspects of the current system, they are not the primary reasons to migrate to a database. Option D is incorrect because MySQL might actually use more disk space due to indexing and other features, but the trade-off in performance and functionality is worth it.\n\nThe transition to MySQL would provide a more robust, scalable, and concurrent-safe data storage solution, which is crucial for a \"medium sized application\" that is \"growing.\" This makes option C the most compelling reason for the transition."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/06", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/484825", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/133430/"], "docs_id": 484825, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The datasheet for the LMH6702 recommends using 6\\.8uF bypass capacitors on both power supply pins.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The LMH6702 datasheet recommends 6.8\u00b5F bypass capacitors for bulk bypassing, which is crucial for its ability to handle low impedance loads and fast slew rates.\n2. However, high-frequency decoupling is also necessary, typically achieved with smaller capacitors like 0.1\u00b5F.\n3.

I want to show `cowsay` when I start terminal.\n\nBut this works:\n\n```\nhash@ssl50:~$ cowsay -f tux \"Carry on\"\n\n< carry on >\n----------\n   \\\n    \\\n        .--.\n       |o_o |\n       |:_/ |\n      //   \\ \\\n     (|     | )\n    /'\\_   _/`\\\n    \\___)=(___/\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, in Linux Mint there is a fun thing you could do: write a script to select a cow and display a message from *fortune*. I'll get to it later. Once you have the script, all you have to do is to execute it. As suggested before, edit your \\~/.bashrc file and add at the end a line containing the path to your script. For example, if you have the script in your home folder and the script's filename is \"cowscript\", then you could add the following line at the end of your \\~/.bashrc file:\n\n```\n$HOME/cowscript\n\n```\n\nNow, the script used in Linux Mint 9 is the following:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nRANGE=4\n\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        cow=\"small\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        cow=\"tux\"\n        ;;\n    2)\n        cow=\"koala\"\n        ;;\n    3)\n        cow=\"moose\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nRANGE=2\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowsay\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowthink\"\n        ;;\nesac\n/usr/games/fortune | $command -f $cow\n\n```\n\nBasically, it will display a random cow (either *small*, *tux*, *koala*, or *moose*) and the message will be taken from fortune. Also, this script will execute wither *cowsay* or *cowthink*, the only difference being that *cowthink* will display a thinking cow instead of a talking cow.\n\nNow, the fun thing is that you can modify the script to show more cows or to show different cows. To do that, you first need to know what cows you have installed. In a terminal, run:\n\n```\ncowsay -l\n\n```\n\nYou can use any of those cows. All you have to do is to edit the script: if you want to add a new cow, just copy the lines containing \"cow\" (plus the number and semi\\-colons) and paste them before the line that says \"esac\". Then, change the number and name of the cow, so for instance, if you want to add a cow called \"udder\", all you have to do is to add these lines before the first \"esac\":\n\n```\n4)\n    cow=\"udder\"\n    ;;\n\n```\n\n**Important**: the second line of the file, \"RANGE\\=4\", must be changed also. If you add one cow, then instead of 4 use 5, also if you delete one cow, then you must use 3, and so on. Also note that the numbers that you see must be in the range from 0 to *RANGE \\- 1*. That's why RANGE is 4 and the numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3\\.\n\nYou could also create your own cows, although that might take a bit more of work. All you have to do is to get any ASCII art you like and edit it, but it is a bit tricky. You can see how it's done here: [http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow\\-to\\-make\\-a\\-cow\\-talk\\-on\\-terminal\\-startup/](http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow-to-make-a-cow-talk-on-terminal-startup/) However, consider that any **@** and **\\\\** symbols need to be backslashed, that is, you must put before that symbol this other symbol: **\\\\**. This might be the case for **\\#**, too (but not always). If your ASCII Art contains **\\#**, you could backslash it too, but sometimes it would be enough with just one of them... I'm not sure how to explain it, sorry. I guess you will have to try to see if it works. Also, make sure that the file you edit has the extension \".cow\"\n\nFinally, once you have your own cows, you can either add them to the default location (you probably will need to be superuser for that) at /usr/share/cowsay/cows, or you could add to your \\~/.bashrc file this lines:\n\n```\nexport COWPATH=\"/usr/share/cowsay/cows\"\n# set COWPATH so it includes user's cows\nif [ -d \"$HOME/cowfiles\" ] ; then\n    COWPATH=\"$COWPATH:$HOME/cowfiles\"\nfi\n\n```\n\nBe sure to add those lines before you call your \"cowscript\". This also assumes that you have a folder called \"cowfiles\" on your home folder. Change the path if you want so it points to the folder where you have your cowfiles."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Linux system administrator wants to create a customized, randomized cowsay greeting for their team's terminals.

This approach aligns best with the information provided in the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. Customization: A bash script allows for easy customization of cow types, messages, and even the inclusion of both cowsay and cowthink commands.\n\n2. Randomization: The script can use the $RANDOM variable to select different cows and messages each time the terminal is opened, providing variety.\n\n3. Extensibility: The script can be easily modified to add new cows or change the message source (e.g., using 'fortune' for random messages).\n\n4. User-specific implementation: By adding the script execution to individual ~/.bashrc files, each user can have their own customized experience or opt-out if desired.\n\n5. Easy maintenance: Centralized script management allows for quick updates and modifications without affecting system-wide configurations.\n\nOption A is less flexible as it doesn't allow for randomization or easy customization.

How do I interpret it? I assume that if lower bound of interval is higher than 0\\.5 then I can conclude that my model is better than random one. What confuses me is that $AUC$ is in the middle of interval so it will always be inside CI. I think that maybe if my model was applied to some different observation, I would be 95% sure that its $AUC$ fit into CI. Am I right?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confidence interval is an interval\\-estimate for some true value of a parameter. Let us (as an example) start with e.g. a confidence interval for the mean of a normal distribution and then move on to ROC and AUC so that one sees the analogy. \n\nAssume that you have a random normal variable $X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu;\\\\sigma)$. Where $\\\\mu$ is the **unknown** population mean and, to keep it simple, let us assume that $\\\\sigma$ is known. \n\nWe now draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of X, i.e. we get a sample $x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\dots x\\_n$. The goal is to have an idea about the unknown $\\\\mu$ using the sample drawn. It is well known that the arithemetic average $\\\\bar{x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_i x\\_i$ is an unbiased (point) estimator for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$ and that $\\[\\\\bar{x}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{x}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$ is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$. \n\nIf we draw another sample $y\\_1, \\\\dots , y\\_n$ from the distribtion of $X$ then, in the same way we will find **another** confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ as $\\[\\\\bar{y}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{y}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$. \n\nSo each time we draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, we find a confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ and all these intervals will be different. **The fact that it is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval means that, if we draw an 'infinite' number of samples of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, and for each of these samples we compute the $95\\\\%$ confidence interval, then $95\\\\%$ of all these intervals (one interval for each sample) will contain the unknown $\\\\mu$.** (so sometimes , namely $5\\\\%$ of the intervals, such an interval will not contain the unknown $\\\\mu$, so sometimes you have bad luck.)\n\nThe same holds for the AUC, when you compute the AUC, you compute it from a sample, in other words what you compute is an estimate for the **true *unknown* AUC**. Similarly you can, for the sample that you have, compute a confidence interval for the true but unknown AUC. If you were able to draw an infinite number of samples, and for each sample obtained compute the confidence interval for the true AUC, then $95\\\\%$ of these computed intervals would contain the true but unknown AUC. \n\n**Note that the interval is random, because it is computed from a random sample. The true AUC is not random, it is some unknown property of your population.**\n\nUnfortunately you can not draw an infinite number of samples, most of the time you have only one sample, so you will have to do it with one interval, **but you are rather confident** ($95\\\\%$ of the so computed intervals will contain the true unknown AUC) that this interval will contain the true AUC. And yes, if the lower border of the interval is higer than 0\\.5 then **you can be rather confident that** your model is not the random model, but, as above, you may also have had bad luck with the sample."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about confidence intervals for AUC in ROC analysis, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist has developed a machine learning model for predicting customer churn.

Which of the following statements most accurately interprets these results?\n\nA) The model is guaranteed to be better than random guessing because the entire confidence interval is above 0.5.\nB) The model's performance is inconclusive because the true AUC could potentially be 0.5, which is within the confidence interval.\nC) If the experiment were repeated many times, about 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true, unknown population AUC.\nD) The confidence interval indicates that the model's AUC will always fall between 0.72 and 0.84 when applied to new data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of confidence intervals in the context of AUC interpretation, requiring integration of statistical concepts and real-world application. The correct answer, C, accurately describes the meaning of a 95% confidence interval for AUC. It emphasizes that the interval is a statistical construct based on repeated sampling, not a definitive range for future performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the interval suggests the model is likely better than random guessing, it doesn't guarantee this with absolute certainty. There's still a small chance (typically 5% for a 95% CI) that the true AUC could be outside this interval.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of the confidence interval. While it's theoretically possible for the true AUC to be 0.5, this is extremely unlikely given the interval, and the statement overemphasizes this remote possibility.\n\nOption D is a common misconception about confidence intervals. It incorrectly suggests that the interval predicts future performance, rather than estimating the unknown true population parameter.\n\nThe correct interpretation (C) emphasizes the frequentist nature of confidence intervals, highlighting that they are properties of the estimation procedure, not of any single interval.

When used with strings, the % operator is for string formatting, not mathematical operations.\n\nThis mirrors the error in the original question, where i%2!=0 was attempted on string inputs.\n\nThe code would work if the conversion to int was done earlier:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [int(raw_input(\"Enter a number: \")) for _ in range(4)]\n```\n\nOption A is incorrect because the code won't run successfully due to the TypeError.\n\nOption C is a distractor that might appeal to those familiar with Python 3, where input() replaced raw_input(), but it's not the primary issue here.\n\nOption D is plausible but incorrect in this context. While a ValueError could occur if non-numeric input was given, the code would fail before reaching that point due to the TypeError with string modulo operations.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (input handling, type conversion, list comprehensions, and operator behavior with different types) and tests critical thinking about code behavior rather than simple memorization."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/10", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/145155", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/13973/"], "docs_id": 145155, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to add a custom attribute to the admin customer grid.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Age of the system: At 13 years old, the furnace is nearing the end of its typical lifespan, making gradual component wear more likely.\n\n2. Intermittent nature: The problem occurs roughly once a week, suggesting a gradual degradation rather than a complete failure.\n\n3. No error codes: This indicates that the system is not detecting a specific fault, which is consistent with a marginal ignition system that occasionally fails to light the burners.\n\n4.

The script needs to find directories containing a file named \"password.old\", but exclude those that also contain a file named \"webvirtual\". Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient and portable solution for this task?\n\nA) Use nested loops to iterate through directories, checking for the presence of both files and applying the exclusion logic\nB) Utilize the 'find' command with '-execdir' to check for 'webvirtual' in directories containing 'password.old'\nC) Implement two separate 'find' commands and use 'grep' to filter the results based on the presence of 'webvirtual'\nD) Create a Python script that walks the directory tree and applies the filtering logic using os.path functions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and portable solution for this task is to use the 'find' command with the '-execdir' option. This approach, as shown in the top answer, combines the search for 'password.old' files with an immediate check for the presence of 'webvirtual' in the same directory, all in a single command:\n\n```\nfind . -path ./OLD -prune -o -name password.old \\\n  ! -execdir [ -e webvirtual ] \\; -printf '%h\\n'\n```\n\nThis solution is superior for several reasons:\n1. It performs the search and filtering in a single pass, making it more efficient than approaches that require multiple commands or passes through the file system.\n2. It uses the '-execdir' option, which is widely supported (GNU find, sfind, and most BSDs), making it more portable than solutions relying on specific shell features or external scripts.\n3. It correctly handles the exclusion logic by checking for 'webvirtual' in the same directory as 'password.old', without needing to process or filter the results afterwards.\n4. The use of '-printf' (or '-execdir pwd \\;' for non-GNU systems) directly outputs the desired directory paths, eliminating the need for additional processing.\n\nOption A (nested loops) would be less efficient and more complex to implement correctly.

Option B is the correct answer because it directly addresses the dash replacement behavior, which is controlled by the 'dashcheck' bibmacro in biblatex-sbl.

Given that the probability of a customer not responding to campaign A but responding to campaign B is 0.3, and the probability of a customer responding to campaign A but not to campaign B is 0.2, what is the probability that a customer responds to at least one of the campaigns?\n\nA) 0.5 + P(A \u2229 B)\nB) 0.7 - P(A \u2229 B)\nC) 0.5 or 0.7, depending on the value of P(A \u2229 B)\nD) 1 - (0.3 + 0.2)\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires the application of probability concepts to a real-world marketing scenario, integrating multiple concepts from the given documentation.\n\n1. We recognize that campaigns A and B are independent events, mirroring the independence of A and B in the original problem.\n\n2. We can map the given probabilities:\n   P(A \u2229 B') = 0.2 (responding to A but not B)\n   P(A' \u2229 B) = 0.3 (responding to B but not A)\n\n3. We're asked to find P(A \u222a B), which represents the probability of responding to at least one campaign.\n\n4. Using the addition rule of probability: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\n5. We can rearrange this as: P(A \u222a B) = [P(A \u2229 B') + P(A \u2229 B)] + [P(A' \u2229 B) + P(A \u2229 B)] - P(A \u2229 B)\n                            = P(A \u2229 B') + P(A' \u2229 B) + P(A \u2229 B)\n                            = 0.2 + 0.3 + P(A \u2229 B)\n                            = 0.5 + P(A \u2229 B)\n\n6. However, we don't know P(A \u2229 B). We know that for independent events, P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B), but we don't know P(A) or P(B) individually.\n\n7. The hint that there are two correct answers suggests that there are two possible values for P(A \u2229 B) that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n8. One possibility is P(A \u2229 B) = 0, which would give P(A \u222a B) = 0.5\n   The other is P(A \u2229 B) = 0.2, which would give P(A \u222a B) = 0.7\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The probability could be either 0.5 or 0.7, depending on the value of P(A \u2229 B).\n\nThis question tests critical thinking and application of probability concepts rather than mere memorization, requires integration of multiple concepts, and includes a real-world scenario, meeting the specified criteria for a high-quality exam question."}, "66": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/22", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/356077", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/264141/"], "docs_id": 356077, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When testing, sometimes a helper method can be useful for repeated task e.g. in test setup. \n\n*Concrete example*:\nWe have certain tests against our rest interface using Spring's `RestTemplate`.

In reality virtually no data is ever a perfect normal distribution, although we can discuss \u201capproximately normal distributions\u201d such as height, weight, temperature, or length of adult ring finger in large population groups.\n\n**Professor's answer:**\n\n> You are correct that there is no perfectly normal distribution. But, we are not looking for perfection. We need to look at data in addition to the histogram and the measures of central tendency. What do the skewness and kurtosis statistics tell you about the distribution? Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A problem with your discussion with the professor is one of terminology, there's a misunderstanding that is getting in the way of conveying a potentially useful idea. In different places, you both make errors.\n\nSo the first thing to address: it's important to be pretty clear about what a [*distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is.\n\nA normal *distribution* is a specific mathematical object, which you could consider as a model for a process (which you might consider an uncountably infinite population of values; no finite population can actually have a continuous distribution).\n\nLoosely, what this distribution does (once you specify the parameters) is define (via an algebraic expression) the proportion of the population values that lies within any given interval on the real line. Slightly less loosely, it defines the probability that a single value from that population will lie in any given interval.\n\nAn observed sample doesn't really have a normal distribution; a sample might (potentially) be drawn from a normal distribution, if one were to exist. If you look at the empirical cdf of the sample, it's discrete. If you bin it (as in a histogram) the sample has a \"frequency distribution\", but those aren't normal distributions. The distribution can tell us some things (in a probabilistic sense) about a random sample from the population, and a sample may also tell us some things about the population.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of a phrase like \"normally distributed sample\"\\* is \"a random sample from a normally distributed population\".\n\n\\*(I generally try to avoid saying it myself, for reasons that are hopefully made clear enough here; usually I manage to confine myself to the second kind of expression.)\n\nHaving defined terms (if still a little loosely), let us now look at the question in detail. I'll be addressing specific pieces of the question.\n\n> normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode\n\nThis is certainly a condition on the normal probability distribution, though not a requirement on a sample drawn from a normal distribution; samples may be asymmetric, may have mean differ from median and so on. \\[We can, however, get an idea how far apart we might reasonably expect them to be if the sample really came from a normal population.]\n\n> all the data must be contained under the bell curve\n\nI am not sure what \"contained under\" means in this sense.\n\n> and perfectly symmetrical around the mean.\n\nNo; you're talking about the *data* here, and a sample from a (definitely symmetrical) normal population would not itself be perfectly symmetric.\n\nHere's some simulated samples from normal distributions:\n\n[![Histograms of 9 samples of size 60 from a normal distribution with population mean 50 and population  standard deviation 5](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)\n\nIf you generate a number of samples of about that sample size (60\\) and plot histograms with about 10 bins, you may see similar variation in general shape.\n\nAs you can see from the histograms, these are not actually symmetric. Some, like 2, 4 and 7, are quite distinctly *asymmetrical*. Some have quite short tails, like 5 and 8, some have noticeably longer tails, at least on one side. Some suggest multiple modes. None actually look all that close to what an actual normal density looks like $\\-$ that is, even random samples don't necessarily look all that much like their populations, at least not until the sample sizes are fairly large $\\-$ considerably larger than the n\\=60 I used here.\n\n> Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies,\n\nI [agree with your conclusion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204471/is-there-an-explanation-for-why-there-are-so-many-natural-phenomena-that-follow/204479#204479) but the reasoning is not correct; it's not a consequence of the fact that *data* are not perfectly symmetric (etc); it's the fact that *populations* are themselves not [perfectly normal](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57407/what-is-the-meaning-of-all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful).\n\n> if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution\n\nIf she said this in just that way, she's definitely wrong.\n\nA sample skewness may be much closer to 0 than that (taking \"less than\" to mean in absolute magnitude not actual value), and the sample excess kurtosis may also be much closer to 0 than that (they might even, whether by chance or construction, potentially be almost exactly zero), and yet the distribution from which the sample was drawn might be distinctly non\\-normal (e.g. bimodal, or clearly asymmetric, or perhaps with somewhat heavier tails than the normal $\\-$ it's not *just* the tail that determines kurtosis)\n\nWe can go further \\-\\- even if we were to magically know the *population* skewness and kurtosis were exactly that of a normal, it still wouldn't of itself tell us the population was normal, nor even something close to normal.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[![double gamma, shape parameter 2.302776](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)\n\nThis particular example is strongly bimodal, heavier tailed than the normal, but symmetric. It has the same skewness and kurtosis as the normal.\n\nFurther examples can be found in [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/154965/805) answer.\n\nNot all are symmetric, and some are discrete.\n\n> The dataset is total number of falls/year in a random sampling of 52 nursing homes which is a random sample of a larger population.\n\nThe population distribution of counts are *never* normal. Counts are discrete and non\\-negative, normal distributions are continuous and over the entire real line.\n\nBut we're really focused on the wrong issue here. Probability models are just that, *models*. Let us not [confuse our models with the real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology)).\n\nThe issue isn't \"are the *data themselves* normal?\" (they can't be), nor even \"is the population from which the data were drawn normal?\" (this is almost never going to be the case).\n\nA more useful question to discuss is \"how badly would my inference be impacted if I treated the population as normally distributed?\"\n\nThat is we should not be overly focused on whether the assumption is *true* (we shouldn't expect that), but whether it's useful, or perhaps what and how severe might the consequences be if we were to use such a model.\n\nIt's also a much harder question to answer well, and may require considerably more work than glancing at a few simple diagnostics.\n\nThe sample statistics you showed are not particularly inconsistent with normality (you could see statistics like that or \"worse\" not terribly rarely if you had random samples of that size from normal populations), but that doesn't of itself mean that the actual population from which the sample was drawn is automatically \"close enough\" to normal for some particular purpose. It would be important to consider the purpose (what questions you're answering), and the robustness of the methods employed for it, and even then we may still not be sure that it's \"good enough\"; sometimes it may be better to simply not assume what we don't have good reason to assume *a priori* (e.g. on the basis of experience with similar data sets).\n\n> it is NOT a normal distribution\n\nData \\- even data drawn from a normal population \\- never have exactly the properties of the population; from those numbers alone you don't have a good basis to conclude that the population is not normal here.\n\nOn the other hand neither do we have any reasonably solid basis to say that it's \"sufficiently close\" to normal \\- we haven't even considered the purpose of assuming normality, so we don't know what distributional features it might be sensitive to.\n\nFor example, if I had two samples for a measurement that was bounded, that I knew would not be heavily discrete (not mostly only taking a few distinct values) and reasonably near to symmetric, I might be relatively happy to use a two\\-sample t\\-test at some not\\-so\\-small sample size; it's moderately robust to mild deviations from the assumptions (somewhat level\\-robust, somewhat less power\\-robust). But I would be considerably more cautious about as causally assuming normality when testing equality of spread, for example, because the best test under that assumption is quite sensitive to the assumption.\n\n> Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\"\n\nIf that's really the criterion by which one decides to use a normal distributional model, then it will sometimes lead you into quite poor analyses.\n\nThe values of those statistics do give us some clues about the population from which the sample was drawn, but that's not at all the same thing as suggesting that their values are in any way a 'safe guide' to choosing an analysis.\n\nCast your mind back to the fact that there's distributional examples where the population has very different shape from the normal, but with the same *population* skewness and kurtosis. Add to that the inherent noise in their sample equivalents (and not least of all, the considerable downbias typical of sample kurtosis), and you may well be concluding rather too much on very limited and possibly misleading evidence.\n\n---\n\nNow to address the underlying issue with even a better phrased version of such a question as the one you had:\n\nThe whole process of looking at a sample to choose a model is fraught with problems \\-\\- doing so alters the properties of any subsequent choices of analysis based on what you saw! e.g for a hypothesis test, your significance levels, p\\-values and power are all *not what you would choose/calculate them to be*, because those calculations are predicated on the analysis not being based on the data.\n\nSee, for example Gelman and Loken (2014\\), \"[The Statistical Crisis in Science](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science),\" *American Scientist*, Volume 102, Number 6, p 460\n(DOI: 10\\.1511/2014\\.111\\.460\\) which discusses issues with such data\\-dependent analysis."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing the distribution of falls in nursing homes and wants to determine if the data can be considered normally distributed for further statistical analysis.

Overriding price-box.js in the theme (app/design/frontend/Your/theme/web/js/price-box.js) allows for adding the label near the original price without modifying core files.

Unfortunately, different authors define uniform integrability differently, which causes quite a lot of confusion, as evident in the number of questions about uniform integrability and Vitali convergence theorem in [MSE](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?q=uniform+integrability+vitali+convergence+theorem). However, after reading many of those questions and the answers, I feel that many students are still confused. In this post, I want to clear all the confusion once and for all.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nThroughout this post, I would use the following definitions.\n\nLet $(X, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\\\Phi$ a collection of measurable functions on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$, taking values in the extended real line.\n\n1. We say $\\\\Phi$ is **uniformly bounded in $L^1$** if\n$$ \\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_X \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\infty $$\n2. We say $\\\\Phi$ **does not escape to vertical infinity** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $M \\> 0$ such that\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{\\|f\\| \\\\geq M} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n3. We say $\\\\Phi$ **does not escape to width infinity** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $m \\> 0$ such that\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{\\|f\\| \\\\leq m} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n4. We call $\\\\Phi$ **equi\\-integrable** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $\\\\delta \\> 0$ such that whenever $A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}$ is a measurable set with $\\\\mu(A) \\< \\\\delta$, we have\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_A \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n5. We call $\\\\Phi$ **tight** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists a measurable set $X\\_0 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}$ such that $\\\\mu(X\\_0\\) \\< \\\\infty$ and\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{X \\\\setminus X\\_0} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n\n**Confusion**\n\nHere comes the confusion about the definitions of uniform integrability:\n\n1. Measure theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as being equi\\-integrable.\n2. Probability theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as not escaping to vertical infinity.\n3. In [Tao's blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/245a-notes-4-modes-of-convergence/), uniform integrability was defined as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$, not escaping to vertical infinity and not escaping to width infinity.\n4. Yet some other authors define uniform integrability as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$ and equi\\-integrable.\n\nWhat adds to more confusion is, the different definitions of uniform integrability are only equivalent under certain assumptions, while in general they are not equivalent. Moreover, different authors formulate the Vitali convergence theorem under different definitions of uniform integrability.\n\n**Claim**\n\nIt is well\\-known that if $\\\\mu$ is a finite measure, then $\\\\Phi$ does not escape to vertical infinity if and only if it is uniformly bounded in $L^1$ and equi\\-integrable. For the general case, I would like to propose the following claim. To avoid confusion, I would avoid the term \"uniformly integrable\" altogether.\n\n> Let $(X, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\\\Phi$ a collection\n> of measurable functions on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$, taking values in the\n> extended real line. We do not make any other assumption on $\\\\mu$ or $\\\\Phi$.\n> Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n> \n> \n> 1. $\\\\Phi$ is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, does not escape to vertical infinity and does not escape to width infinity\n> 2. $\\\\Phi$ does not escape to vertical infinity and is tight\n> 3. $\\\\Phi$ is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, equi\\-integrable and tight\n> \n> \n> Now, let $(f\\_n)$ be a sequence of measurable functions and $f$ another\n> measurable function on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$. Suppose that:\n> \n> \n> 1. the collection $\\\\Phi \\= \\\\{f\\_n : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$ satisfies any one of the equivalent conditions above,\n> 2. the sequence $(f\\_n)$ converges to $f$ either almost everywhere or in measure,\n> \n> \n> then we have $f \\\\in L^1(\\\\mu)$, and $(f\\_n)$ converges to $f$ in\n> $L^1(\\\\mu)$.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Is my claim correct?\n2. Is there any book or paper that makes a concerted effort to clear the confusion around uniform integrability and Vitali convergence theorem?\n\n*Edit:*\n3\\. [Iosif Pinelis' answer](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/405294/confusion-around-uniform-integrability-and-vitali-convergence-theorem/405336#405336) gives an counter\\-example in which a sequence of functions is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, does not escape to vertical infinity, and does not escape to width infinity. However, the sequence is neither equi\\-integrable nor tight. So how to connect [Tao's definition of uniform integrability](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4042711/different-definition-of-uniform-integrability) with equi\\-integrability and tightness?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Edge matching problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-matching_puzzle), such as the [Eternity II puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_II_puzzle) are NP\\-complete.

The researcher wants to apply the Vitali convergence theorem but is unsure about the conditions for uniform integrability. Which of the following sets of conditions is both necessary and sufficient for the collection \u03a6 = {fn : n \u2208 \u2115} to satisfy the requirements of uniform integrability in the most general case?\n\nA) \u03a6 is uniformly bounded in L1 and equi-integrable\nB) \u03a6 does not escape to vertical infinity and is tight\nC) \u03a6 is uniformly bounded in L1 and does not escape to vertical infinity\nD) \u03a6 is equi-integrable and does not escape to width infinity\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires a deep understanding of the various definitions of uniform integrability and their relationships. The correct answer is B because, according to the claim in the documentation, the condition \"\u03a6 does not escape to vertical infinity and is tight\" is equivalent to the most general definition of uniform integrability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the tightness condition, which is necessary when \u03bc is not a finite measure. This definition is often used in probability theory textbooks but is not sufficient in the general case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it lacks both the tightness condition and the \"not escaping to width infinity\" condition. This definition, while used by some authors, is not sufficient to guarantee the equivalence with other definitions in the general case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it omits the crucial condition of being uniformly bounded in L1 and the tightness condition. Equi-integrability alone is not sufficient, and \"not escaping to width infinity\" is part of a different equivalent formulation.\n\nThe key insight here is that in the most general case, with no assumptions on \u03bc or \u03a6, we need both the \"not escaping to vertical infinity\" condition (which implies uniform boundedness in L1) and the tightness condition. This combination ensures that the collection of functions behaves well both for large values and on sets of large measure, which is crucial for the Vitali convergence theorem to hold in its most general form."}, "78": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/05/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/499538", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/336856/"], "docs_id": 499538, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does \"for\" or \"since\" work in place of \"when\" in this sentence?\n\nWhy do you keep buying plants when you just end up killing them?\n\nIf not, why?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Those alternatives do not work very well in that sentence.\n\n\"Since\" and \"for\" are used in the same way as \"because\"; that is, the complement should describe a causal relationship and they should be used in a declarative statement.\n\nYou could say, for example, **\"I wonder why you keep buying plants, since you just end up killing them.\"** In this case, I am making a declaration (\"I wonder why\") and the *reason* for the thing I'm declaring is the fact that you end up killing the plants.\n\nIn the statement you have, \"when\" is a subordinating conjunction which heads an adverbial clause that modifies \"buying.\" You could use \"if\" in a similar role: **\"Why do you keep buying plants if you just end up killing them?\"**\n\nIn informal conversation, I would not be surprised to hear someone swap in one of the words as you have suggested, although the grammar does not hold up to scrutiny when written down.

Ann Corio claims that the term was originated by early striptease artist Carrie Finnell. Presumably, when she tossed the apparatus on her dressing table one night it fell in the shape of a \"G.\" *see* CHICAGO G\\-STRING \\[the entry for which reads \"An especially revealing type of G\\-string used by strippers which is sewn to an elastic band in a manner that allows \"the bauble to fly\" and reveal pudendum underneath.\"]\n\nFrom Robert Chapman, *New Dictionary of American Slang* (1986\\):\n\n> **gee string** or **G\\-string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** *fr middle 1800s* A breech\\-cloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn especially by striptease dancers: *Thus the* G\\-string *became an integral part of a stripper's apparatus* \u2014Toronto Life {origin unknown}\n\nFrom Barbara Kipfer \\& Robert Chapman, *Dictionary of American Slang*, fourth edition (2005\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** or **gee string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** A breechcloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn esp by striptease dancers \\[citation omitted] {1878\\+; origin unknown; the dated use refers to Plains Indian use of a loincloth; the stripper sense is found in the 1930s}\n\nFrom Robert Hendrickson, *The QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins*, fourth edition (2008\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** Stripteasers, who sometimes call this a \"gadget,\" aren't responsible for the word. *G\\-string* is an Americanism first used to describe an Indian's loin cloth or breechclout in the 19th century. It could be that some fiddler in the West compared the heaviest of violin strings, the G string, to the length of sinew or gut the Indians tied around their waists to hold up their breechclouts. But even the heavies of violin strings wouldn't really do the job. Perhaps the g i is just a euphemistic shortening of \"groin,\" an indecent word at the time. The burlesque G\\-string is of course far smaller than the Indian variety and must have seemed even skimpier a century ago, considering the Brunhildean builds of yesterday's ecdysiasts. One burlesque company of the day proudly advertised \"two tons of women\" and had only 20 strippers.\n\nSo your question about the origin of *G\\-string* might actually be separated into three distinct questions: (1\\) why did U.S. settlers on the Great Plains in the 1870s call the rawhide band used to hold a Native American's loincloth in place a \"geestring\"? (2\\) why did U.S. dance\\-art enthusiasts call the genital covering used by striptease artists a *G\\-string*? (3\\) what connection is there between the nineteenth\\-century \"gee string\" and the 1930s\u2013present \"G\\-string\"?\n\nI will run some database searches into those questions and add to this answer if I find anything interesting.\n\n---\n\n***On the transition from 'geestring' to G\\-string'***\n\nWith regard to the question of the connection between *geestring* and *G\\-string*, it is noteworthy that *G string* appears as early as 1881 as spelling variant for *geestring*.

Consequently there was a grand display of legs and arms and spinal columns and shoulders and patella and torsos, to say the least.\n> \n> \n> The police censors, mean and women, who patrol the beach have solved the problem in a delicate way. The women police go armed with a needle and thread and when a girl is discovered tastily clad in a **gee string** and a light sprinkling of tan, the coppess takes her to one side and sews on fringe.\n\nAn Elephind search also yields three matches for the odd expression \"bust a G string\"(one each from Australia, California, and Virginia) and two for \"broke a G string\" (from Colorado and Illinois)\u2014all between 1907 and 1937\\.

The correct answer, C, best represents the evolution of \"G-string\" as described in the documentation. \n\nThe term originated as \"geestring\" in the 1870s, referring to Native American loincloths. This usage is evidenced by the 1878 citation from Beadle's \"Western Wilds.\" The spelling variant \"G string\" appeared as early as 1881 in a similar context.\n\nAn intermediate, more general usage is suggested by the 1921 newspaper article about bathing suits, where \"gee string\" is used to describe minimal clothing in a non-Native American context.\n\nFinally, by the 1930s, \"G-string\" was being used in the context of burlesque and striptease performances, as indicated by the 1935 newspaper article about Parisian music halls.\n\nThis progression demonstrates a clear evolution of the term from its original Native American context to its more widely known usage in entertainment, with evidence of intermediate, generalized use. Options A, B, and D do not accurately reflect this documented progression and the connections between the different uses of the term over time."}, "80": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/11", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/200350", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/30449/"], "docs_id": 200350, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it safe to use thin sections of copper traces as one\\-shot fuses when cost is important, but when it is also vital to protect the rest of the circuitry?

Admittedly a minor concern, but I don't see any pros for exposing the trace.\n\nThe above board was designed with pads to replace the fuse, it's from a car stereo system so they're likely expecting shorts downstream rather than surges from upstream. Having exposed pads for the latter case would be less desirable as a surge might burn the fuse and leave a conductive creepage path between the pads.\n\n[This paper](http://www.ultracad.com/articles/fusingr.pdf) explores and provides calculations for determining trace size for a printed fuse with a variety of copper weights.\n\nA salient point from the paper, in case it isn't always available is the approximation for the time in seconds (\\\\$ t \\\\$) before a trace reaches melting temperature given current passing through it (\\\\$I\\\\$) and its cross sectional area in mils squared (\\\\$A\\\\$):\n\n$$t \\= 0\\.0346 \\\\times {{A}\\\\over{I}}^2$$\n\nNote that this is the approximate time to *melt* the copper given a 20\u00b0C ambient temperature.

The correct approach involves:\n\n1. Keeping the solder mask intact: The documentation states, \"The trace should not be exposed. An exposed trace will be subject to contamination, possibly conductive contamination, which changes the amount of conductor you designed for a certain current.\"\n\n2.

You could have 10 variables that each individually account for 90% of the variance, but if that is the same 90% of the variance then that may not be interesting to you. Performing regression with L1 and/or L2 norms can help you to identify variables or groups of variables that correlate well with your data.

Which of the following approaches would be most effective in identifying the 10 questions that best capture the overall wealth variation?\n\nA) Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on all 32 variables and select the 10 with the highest loadings on the first component\nB) Use stepwise regression with the full PCA-derived wealth index as the dependent variable and the 32 asset questions as predictors\nC) Apply Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) feature selection to identify the most informative and non-redundant set of 10 questions\nD) Calculate Spearman's rank correlation between each asset question and the full PCA-derived wealth index, selecting the top 10\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation and real-world survey design. While option A (using PCA loadings) might seem intuitive, it doesn't account for potential redundancy among high-loading variables. Option B (stepwise regression) could work but may not be optimal for capturing overall variation. Option D (Spearman's correlation) doesn't account for interactions between variables.\n\nThe correct answer, C (MRMR feature selection), addresses the key challenges in this scenario:\n\n1. It aims to maximize the relevance of selected features (questions) to the target variable (overall wealth).\n2. It minimizes redundancy among selected features, ensuring a diverse set of questions that capture different aspects of wealth.\n3. It can handle non-linear relationships between assets and wealth, which may not be captured by simple correlations or PCA loadings.\n4. It provides a principled approach to feature selection that balances predictive power with questionnaire brevity.\n\nThis approach aligns with the researcher's goal of choosing a subset of questions that jointly explain the largest possible proportion of wealth variation while avoiding redundancy.

This will call the product view configurable template into your list.\n\n```xml\n  <referenceBlock name=\"category.products.list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n</referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nYou will need to do the same for catalogsearch\\_result\\_index.xml as the xml is different for search results though uses the same catalog list template\n\n```xml\n <referenceBlock name=\"search_result_list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n </referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nNow we have this you need to overide the Magento\\_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml template again in the theme or module, you then need to make it look like the below.\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

Creating a custom module with a plugin for Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Model\\Product\\Type\\Configurable is necessary to ensure proper handling of configurable products in the list view.\n\n2. Overriding list.phtml and modifying the form element are essential to include the necessary hidden input fields and ensure the form structure is correct for each product.\n\n3. Adding a new block in catalog_category_view.xml (and catalogsearch_result_index.xml for search results) is crucial to include the configurable options template in the category listing.\n\n4. Overriding configurable.phtml and including product-specific selectors in the JavaScript initialization is necessary to ensure that price updates and option selections work correctly for each individual product in the grid.\n\n5. Modifying the form action to include product-specific IDs ensures that the correct product is added to the cart when the form is submitted.\n\n6.

Which approach would best suit their needs, and why?\n\nA) Develop a standalone application using vanilla Minecraft's codebase\nB) Create a custom mod pack using the FTB launcher\nC) Build their platform on top of vanilla Minecraft and distribute it as a separate game\nD) Develop a new game engine from scratch inspired by Minecraft's mechanics\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing the given information and applying it to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. FTB (Feed The Beast) provides a launcher that automatically adds mods to Minecraft, which aligns with the studio's need for advanced features and customizations.\n\n2. Using the FTB launcher addresses the ease of distribution requirement, as it's designed to simplify the process of adding and managing mods.\n\n3. Creating a custom mod pack allows the studio to tailor the experience specifically for educational purposes while leveraging the existing Minecraft ecosystem.\n\n4. This approach balances the need for customization with development efficiency, as it doesn't require building an entire game from scratch.\n\nOption A is incorrect because vanilla Minecraft lacks the advanced features needed for the educational platform. Option C, while possible, would be more complex and legally challenging than using the existing modding ecosystem. Option D would be extremely time-consuming and unnecessary given the availability of Minecraft's modding capabilities.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate knowledge about vanilla Minecraft and FTB, apply it to a practical scenario, and evaluate the best solution based on given requirements \u2013 all of which require critical thinking beyond simple recall."}, "87": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/15", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/309651", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/133975/"], "docs_id": 309651, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not sure about the grammar rules of formulating questions.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the timing and dependencies of system services during boot.\n\nThe error message suggests that dnsmasq can't find the interface, but multiple system tools (ifconfig, ip addr, and /sys/class/net) show the interface as up and running. This apparent contradiction hints at a race condition during system startup.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the interface appears correctly configured according to the system tools.\n\nOption C is unlikely because all tools consistently show the interface name as enp2s0.\n\nOption D is also incorrect, as the configuration file correctly specifies the interface name.\n\nOption B is the most likely explanation. The dnsmasq service might be starting too early in the boot process, before the network interface is fully initialized and ready. This explains why manually starting the service later also fails - the service might be caching the interface status from its initial failed start.\n\nThis scenario tests the candidate's ability to analyze complex system interactions, understand service dependencies, and troubleshoot timing-related issues in system initialization.

This results in a single file (GeoTIFF) that contains both the image data and its geographic referencing information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 'gdal_merge' is typically used to combine multiple georeferenced images into a single larger image, not to convert file formats.\n\nOption B, while theoretically possible, would require unnecessary custom coding when GDAL already provides a built-in solution.\n\nOption D is impractical and error-prone, as manually editing binary files is complex and risky.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a real-world GIS data management scenario, apply knowledge of geospatial file formats and GDAL utilities, and choose the most efficient solution using command-line tools in a Linux environment."}, "91": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/11", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/94555", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 94555, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is very odd, i have one default microphone and i have another second microphone.

I can figure out the centre of Normal Reaction but not how it's distributed over the surface.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to consider the elastic properties of the contact to determine the distribution of forces. Actually, it is the distribution of pressure you are interested, since you sum up the pressures to get force, and sum of the moment of pressure to get torque. Imagine a contact area with the center is on the contact point, the *z*\\-axis normal to the contact, and the *xy* plane along the contact.\n\n$$ \\\\begin{aligned}\n F\\_z \\& \\= \\\\int P(x,y) \\\\, {\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_x \\& \\= \\\\int (\\-y) P(x,y) \\\\,{\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_y \\& \\= \\\\int (\\+x) P(x,y)\\\\, {\\\\rm d} A\n\\\\end{aligned} $$\n\nSo given a pressure distribution $P(x,y)$ you can find the forces, but how to get the pressure distribution? \n\nThe most basic example is an object pushing on a flat plane. Consider the case where there is a known overlap amount $a(x,y)$ as a function of location on the contact\n\n![overlap](https://i.imgur.com/FDcm2Lc.png)\n\nAs a result, the surface of the object (red curve) must deform by $\\\\delta(x,y)$ in order to conform to the overlap. Surface pressure (yellow curve) must be applied to the object to do this\n\n![pressure](https://i.imgur.com/BQHR15q.png)\n\nThe pressure deflection relationship was developed by [Boussinesq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Point_contact_on_a_(3D)_half-space) and it looks like this\n\n$$ \\\\delta(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{1\\-\\\\nu^2}{\\\\pi E} \\\\iint \\\\frac{P(u,v)}{r} {\\\\rm d} A $$ \n\nwhere $r\\=\\\\sqrt{(x\\-u)^2\\+(y\\-v)^2}$ and $\\\\nu$ is the [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio) of the material and $E$ is the [Elastic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus).\n\nA special case for the above is the [Hertzian contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Classical_solutions_for_non-adhesive_elastic_contact) which deals with a sphere on a plane, sphere on a sphere, cylinder on a cylinder (2D contact) and general football shape (two radii) contact.\n\nThe general case can only be treated numerically with the contact are divided into a grid and a giant system of equations is developed of the form $\\\\delta\\_i \\= C\\_{i j} P\\_j$ (Hartnett solution).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Assume a certain amount of overlap $a(x,y)$ derived from the maximum penetration amount.\n2. Set the deflections equal to the overlap, and solve for the pressures $P(x,y)$.\n3. Calculate the total load and moments, and adjust the overlap accordingly. If the total load is less than the applied load then increase the overlap, and if the total moment is less than the applied torque then tilt the object\n4. If the forces and moments are still imbalanced, then go to step 2 and repeat until convergence has been achieved.\n\n---\n\nSee [this detailed paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768309003047) for one example on numerical contact analysis.

The correct answer, C, is the most comprehensive and adaptable approach:\n\n1. Using a single point of contact (A) is overly simplistic and doesn't account for the pressure distribution across the surface, which is crucial for handling delicate objects.\n\n2. Applying uniform pressure (B) doesn't consider the object's shape or material properties, which could lead to damage or insufficient grip on some parts of the object.\n\n3.

It allows for:\n   - Calculation of pressure distribution P(x,y) across the contact surface\n   - Consideration of the object's shape through the overlap function a(x,y)\n   - Adaptation to different material properties (through Poisson's ratio and Elastic modulus)\n   - Iterative adjustment of the applied force and moments to achieve the optimal grip\n\n4.

I include closely related Proposition 1, which was my original goal.\n\n**Proposition 1**\n*Let $G$ be a compact group (not necessarily Lie). Consider the action by $G$ by conjugation on $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ (the space of subgroups of $G$, endowed with the Chabauty topology). Then the orbits of $G\\_0$ (connected component of 1\\) coincide with the connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$.*\n\nAs a corollary, for $G$ a compact group, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if $G\\_0$ is central in $G$ (equivalently, $G/Z(G)$ is totally disconnected), a result obtained in \\[FG]. More generally, it can be checked that for an arbitrary locally compact group $G$, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if either totally disconnected, or $G$ is pointwise elliptic with $G\\_0$ central. ($G$ pointwise elliptic means that every single element generates a cyclic subgroup with compact closure.)\n\n**Lemma 2**\n*Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $F$ be a finite group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $F\\\\to G$.*\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)$ can be described as a real algebraic variety, so has finitely many components. By \\[LW], all homomorphisms in a given component are conjugate under $G\\_0$.\n\\\\end{proof}\n\n**Lemma 3**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $S$ be a connected compact semisimple Lie group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $S\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(S,G)$ is canonically identified with the space of Lie algebra homomorphisms $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}$, which is an algebraic variety as well, so has finitely many connected components. So we can again use \\[LW].\n\n**Lemma 4**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $D$ be a connected compact abelian Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $D\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nAny such homomorphism maps into a maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate \\[Bourbaki, Groupes et Alg\u00e8bres de Lie, Chap 9, \u00a72\\.2]. This reduces to the case when $G$ is a torus, but then the result just follows from the fact that $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^a,(\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^b)\\\\simeq\\\\mathbf{Z}^{ab}$, which is countable.\n\n**Lemma 5**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed connected subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nSince there are finitely many isomorphism types of compact semisimple groups in a given dimension, we can fix this type, so by Lemma 3, it is enough to consider the set of closed connected subgroups whose semisimple part is a given subgroup $S$. Therefore, it is enough to count conjugacy classes of closed abelian connected subgroups in $N(S)/S$, where $N(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the normalizer, and Lemma 4 applies. \n\n**Proposition 6**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nBy Lemma 5, we can consider those subgroups for which $H\\_0\\=L$ is given. So it is enough to count conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $N(L)/L$, there are countably many because of Lemma 2\\.\n\n*Proof of Proposition 1*\nWe begin with the case when $G$ is a Lie group. Since $G\\_0$ has finite index in $G$, Proposition 6 implies that there are countably many $G\\_0$\\-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Clearly, it is invariant under conjugation by $G\\_0$. We just obtained that the quotient of $C$ by the action of $G\\_0$ is countable. It is also a compact connected Hausdorff space, so is reduced to a point (it is Hausdorff because the acting group is compact, see \\[Bourbaki, Topologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, III, \u00a74\\.1]. This means that $G\\_0$ acts transitively on each connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$, and we are done.\n\nNow let us deal with a general compact group $G$. (It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is countable). We write $G$ as a projective limit of compact Lie groups $G/K\\_i$. Clearly, if two elements $H,H'$ of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ are conjugate under $G\\_0$, then they lie in the same component. Conversely, suppose they belong to the same connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Then since $K\\_i$ is compact, the projection map $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{S}(G/K\\_i)$ is continuous. Because of the case of Lie groups, there exists $g\\_i\\\\in G\\_0$ such that $(g\\_iHg\\_i^{\\-1}K\\_i\\=H'K\\_i)$ (we use the fact that the inverse image of the unit component of $G/K\\_i$ is the unit component of $G$). Let $g$ be a limit point of $(g\\_i)$. If $h\\\\in H$, then $g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}$ can be written as $h'\\_ik\\_i$ with $h'\\_i\\\\in H'$ and $k\\_i\\\\in K\\_i$. Necessarily $k\\_i\\\\to 1$, so $h'\\_i\\=g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}k\\_i^{\\-1}$ also converges, necessarily to an element $h'$ of $H'$. We have $ghg^{\\-1}\\=h'$. This proves that $gHg^{\\-1}\\\\subset H'$, and the converse inclusion $g^{\\-1}H'g\\\\subset H'$ is strictly similar.\n\n\\[FG] S. Fisher, P. Gartside.

They encounter a surprising result about the number of conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in a compact Lie group. Which of the following statements best explains the reason behind this result and its implications?\n\nA) The result is due to the fact that compact Lie groups have finitely many connected components, which limits the possible subgroup structures.\n\nB) The countability of conjugacy classes is a direct consequence of the real algebraic nature of inclusions between closed subgroups, without requiring advanced topological arguments.\n\nC) The result follows from the interplay between the Chabauty topology on the space of subgroups and the action of the connected component of the identity on this space.\n\nD) The countability is primarily due to the finite-dimensional nature of Lie algebras associated with compact Lie groups, which constrains the possible subgroup structures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it captures the essence of the proof provided in the documentation. The key to understanding the countability of conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in a compact Lie group lies in the interaction between topology and group actions.\n\nThe proof begins with Proposition 1, which establishes that for a compact group G, the orbits of G\u2080 (the connected component of the identity) acting by conjugation on the space of subgroups S(G) coincide with the connected components of S(G). This is crucial because it links the algebraic structure (conjugacy classes) with the topological structure (connected components).\n\nThe proof then proceeds through several lemmas, building up to Proposition 6, which states that there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in a compact Lie group. This is achieved by breaking down the problem into cases involving finite groups, connected compact semisimple Lie groups, and connected compact abelian Lie groups.\n\nThe Chabauty topology on S(G) plays a vital role, as it allows us to consider the space of subgroups as a topological space. The action of G\u2080 on this space is then shown to have countable quotient, which, combined with the compactness and connectedness of the components, leads to the conclusion that G\u2080 acts transitively on each connected component.\n\nWhile option B mentions the real algebraic nature of inclusions, which is indeed relevant (as mentioned in Lemma 2), it oversimplifies the proof and doesn't capture the full complexity of the argument involving topology and group actions.\n\nOptions A and D, while touching on relevant aspects of Lie group theory, do not accurately represent the core reasoning behind the countability result as presented in the documentation.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from Lie group theory, topology, and group actions, testing the ability to analyze and apply these concepts to understand a deep result about the structure of compact Lie groups."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/386978", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/328314/"], "docs_id": 386978, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am making a program that tracks whether an employee has checked in on a software app that day. The employee can check in at any time, so long as they check in before their shift ends. If they don't check in, then a notification gets sent to their supervisor (where they might get in some trouble :) ). My question is how to best implement this considering that user shifts may change and some days they may be absent, so notifications shouldn't be sent.\n\nRight now I'm thinking about making a Shift table and assigning each user their own shift. In other words, each user has one shift, and each shift has one user. I could include it in the user table, but it's getting way too crowded. That way it can be edited easily. Maybe a second table where supervisors can save and load presets. But in this case, what type of data structure can I use to store excused absences and how can I store the days they work (Mon, Tues, Wed...)? Does their need to be another table just for approved absences? Can I just store the days in an array. I'm using postgresql, so this is possible.\n\nAnyway, those are my ideas.

This solution addresses the complex requirements while offering several advantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: It allows for easy management of varying shift patterns, including regular shifts, exceptions, and absences.\n2. Data efficiency: By using shift recipes (e.g., \"mon-fri from jan 2 alternately 06:00 - 15:00 or 14:00 - 23:00\") instead of storing individual day patterns, it reduces data redundancy.\n3. Scalability: The hierarchical structure (employee groups, departments) makes it easier to manage large numbers of employees and complex organizational structures.\n4. Easy maintenance: Shift times, holidays, and crew groups can be managed using schemes, making updates more efficient.\n5. Future-proofing: This approach allows for precalculated data to be added later if needed, without requiring a complete restructure.\n\nOption A is less flexible and doesn't account for shift patterns or easy management of group schedules. Option B, storing day-by-day patterns as arrays, would be less efficient and harder to maintain for complex schedules. Option D would lead to a very wide, sparse table that would be difficult to query and maintain efficiently.\n\nThe chosen approach (C) aligns with the top answer's recommendation to create a more detailed concept in advance, which will lead to easier data maintenance and more efficient operations in the long run, despite requiring more initial setup work."}}
