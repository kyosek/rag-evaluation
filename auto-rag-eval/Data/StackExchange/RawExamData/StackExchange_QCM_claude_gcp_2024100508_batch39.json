I would be particularly interested in answers using the RSK\\-correspondence or subspaces of $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_q^n$.\n\n1. Given a permutation $\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n$, let $\\\\mathrm{inv}(\\\\sigma)$ denote the number of *inversions* of $\\\\sigma$; that is, pairs $(x,y)$ with $x \\< y$ and $\\\\sigma(x) \\> \\\\sigma(y)$. Then $\\[n]!\\_q \\= \\\\sum\\_{\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n} q^{\\\\mathrm{inv}(\\\\sigma)}$.\n2. An element $x \\\\in \\\\{1,\\\\ldots, n\\-1\\\\}$ is a *descent* of $\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n$ if $\\\\sigma(x) \\> \\\\sigma(x\\+1\\)$. The *major index* $\\\\mathrm{maj}(\\\\sigma)$ is the sum of the descents of $\\\\sigma$. Then $\\[n]!\\_q \\= \\\\sum\\_{\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n} q^{\\\\mathrm{maj}(\\\\sigma)}$. I think this is due to MacMahon.\n3. In the ['inside\\-out' version of the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) on an $n$\\-card deck, at step $j\\-1$, card $j\\-1$ from the top is swapped with one of cards in positions $0, 1, \\\\ldots, j\\-1$ from the top, chosen uniformly at random. These choices are enumerated by $1 \\+ q \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ q^{j\\-1}$. After $n$ steps (starting with $j\\=1$), each permutation has equal probability. (This is essentially coset enumeration in the symmetric group by the chain $\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_1 \\\\le \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_2 \\\\le \\\\ldots \\\\le \\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n$.) Hence $\\[n]!\\_q$ enumerates permutations according to the sum of the positions chosen at each stage.\n\n> Does the [normal Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) have a similar combinatorial interpretation? Is there a more natural interpretation of the $q$\\-power, still using the inside\\-out Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle?\n\nFinally, (1\\) makes it easy to see that $\\[n]!\\_q$ is symmetric, i.e. the coefficients of $q^m$ and $q^{\\\\binom{n}{2}\\-m}$ are the same: use the Coxeter involution, thinking of $\\[n]\\_q!$ as the Poincar\u00e9 series of the Coxeter group $\\\\mathrm{Sym}\\_n$. This can also be seen in a similar way from (2\\). But it does not seem to be obvious from (3\\).\n\n> Which interpretation is the best way to show that the coefficients in $\\[n]!\\_q$ are unimodal, i.e. first increasing then decreasing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This answer concerns a geometric/Lie\\-theoretic interpretation of $\\[n]!\\_q$.\n\n$\\[n]!\\_q$ gives the number of points in the full flag variety of full flags of subspaces in an $n$\\-dimensional vector space $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_q^n$ over the finite field $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_q$.\n\nRecall that the full flag variety (over any field) has a natural stratification, the *Bruhat stratification*. Due to the above point\\-counting remark, it follows that the coefficient of $q^i$ in $\\[n]!\\_q$ is the number of $i$\\-dimensional cells in the Bruhat stratification.\n\nThere is also a way to deduce the unimodality of the coefficients from this geometric perspective. Namely, the partial order on the Bruhat cells whereby $C \\\\leq C'$ if $C$ is contained in the closure of $C'$ is called the *Bruhat order* or *strong order*. The strong order can be viewed as an order on the symmetric group because the Bruhat cells are naturally labeled by permutations. Strong order is graded, and the rank sizes are precisely the coefficients of $\\[n]!\\_q$ (i.e., the number of permutations with given inversion number). Richard Stanley showed in the \"Weyl groups...\" paper cited below that in this situation (when you have a complex projective variety with a cellular decomposition satisfying certain conditions), the poset in question is necessarily graded, rank\\-symmetric, rank\\-unimodal, and strongly Sperner, which in particular implies the unimodality of the coefficients of $\\[n]!\\_q$. His proof employed the hard Lefschetz theorem and so can hardly be called elementary, but it is conceptual.\n\n*Stanley, Richard P.*, [**Weyl groups, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Sperner property**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/0601021), SIAM J.

However, option A is incorrect. While it's true that [n]!_q is related to inversions in permutations, the correct statement would be that [n]!_q is the generating function for inversions, i.e., [n]!_q = \u2211_{\u03c3 \u2208 Sym_n} q^(inv(\u03c3)), where inv(\u03c3) is the number of inversions in \u03c3.

The biggest factor now is that cordless drills have fallen so far in price that the market for corded is comprised entirely of people who have opted out of cordless. The superior holding power of keyed chucks, depth stops, secondary handles to counter torque, along with the more powerful tool make the corded drill excel at drilling multiple or difficult holes. \n\nOther features which have remained on the corded drill are because of its superiority in continuous usage. The trigger lock can be handy if you're using the drill as a grinder, buffer, whatever. If you need to use the drill inverted for whatever reason it's easier than holding the trigger with a pinky. Setting the speed via a dial rather than trigger pressure is also preferable there, because you can lock in the slower speed. \n\nThe keyless chuck and clutch common on cordless drills are more user friendly when it comes to rapid bit changes and driving fasteners. The addition of the clutch necessitates reverse, because \"only drives screws\" is an awful selling point.

Because I, the package author, did not have any sensible use case in mind, when writing the macro handling.\n\n**Explanation**: Because the mhchem syntax is so different from normal LaTeX, I have to parse it *before* any inner expansion. So I have to take care of macros early on and decide how to handle them. I had some 'academic' use cases in mind that insert some special symbols. However, it never occurred to me that one would like to insert text with macros. Therefore, the macro expansion somehow ended up in math mode.\n\n**Recent Changes:** During transition to version 4, I realized this inconsistency (\\= your bug report) and put all macros into the correct mode before expansion, i.e. text mode for `\\ce{...}` and math mode for `$\\ce{...}$`. So it is more consistent now.

According to the package author's explanation, when writing the macro handling for mhchem, they did not anticipate users wanting to insert text using macros. As a result, the parsing of macros was implemented early in the process, before expansion, and somehow ended up being processed in math mode.

Let $f:\\\\mathbb R\\\\to\\\\mathbb R\\_\\+$ be a function such that $\\\\{x:f(x)\\=0\\\\}\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ and $f$ is continuous at zero. Let $\\\\phi:\\\\mathbb R\\\\to\\\\mathbb R$ be locally Lipschitz continuous, so that the differential equation $x'\\=\\\\phi(x)$ admits a unique local solution for any given initial condition $x\\_0$. We denote the solution by $X:(t,x\\_0\\)\\\\mapsto X\\_t(x\\_0\\)$. Suppose also that $0$ is stable for this equation, in the sense that there exists a neighbourhood of zero from which all solutions are defined for all times, and $\\\\lim\\_{r\\\\to0}\\\\sup\\_{\\|x\\_0\\|\\\\leq r}\\\\sup\\_{t\\\\geq0}\\|X\\_t(x\\_0\\)\\|\\=0$.

Take any such $f$ that goes to zero at infinity (say $f:x\\\\mapsto x^2/(1\\+x^4\\)$) and any such $\\\\phi$ that admits solutions going to infinity (say $\\\\phi:x\\\\mapsto (x^3\\-x)/(1\\+x^4\\)$). Then any solution going to infinity satisfies the first but not the second condition (with the given $f$ and $\\\\phi$, the set of $x\\_0$ satisfying the first condition is $\\\\mathbb R\\\\setminus\\\\{\\-1,1\\\\}$, while for the the second it is $(\\-1,1\\)$).\n\n> **Question 2\\.**\n> Does $(P)$ hold if we suppose that $f$ is [radially unbounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radially_unbounded_function)?\n\nNo. It would be obvious that it fails if $f$ were allowed to have another point $x$ such that $f(x)\\=0$. But it also works with something like\n$$f:x\\\\mapsto \\\\begin{cases}x^2(x\\-2\\)^2 \\& \\\\text{for }x\\\\neq1,\\\\\\\\1\\&\\\\text{for }x\\=1\\.\\\\end{cases}$$\nThen just take $\\\\phi:x\\\\mapsto\\-x(x\\-1\\)(x\\-2\\)/(1\\+x^4\\)$.\n\n> **Question 3\\.**\n> Does $(P)$ hold for $f$ lower semicontinuous and eventually bounded below\\*?\n\n\\* Say that we mean $\\\\lim\\_{R\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\inf\\_{\\|x\\|\\\\geq R}f(x)\\>0$, whereas radially bounded meant that this limit was $\\\\infty$.\n\nYes. If the limit inferior of $t\\\\mapsto f(X\\_t(x\\_0\\))$ is zero, then by definition there exists a sequence of times $t\\_n\\\\to\\\\infty$ such that $f(X\\_{t\\_n}(x\\_0\\))$ converges to zero.

By compactness, we can extract a subsequence $n\\\\mapsto\\\\sigma(n)$ for which $X\\_{t\\_{\\\\sigma(n)}}(x\\_0\\)$ converges, say to some limit $x\\_\\\\infty\\\\in\\[\\-R,R]$. Using the lower semicontinuity, we know that $\\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}f(X\\_{t\\_{\\\\sigma(n)}}(x\\_0\\))\\\\geq f(x\\_\\\\infty)$, so $f(x\\_\\\\infty)\\=0$ and $x\\_\\\\infty\\=0$.

Technically this might count as a violation of POSIX, but `/proc` is a special filesystem after all.\n\n`/proc/<pid>/exe` appears to be a symlink when you `stat` it. This is a convenient way for the kernel to export the pathname it knows for the process' executable.

The /proc/<pid>/exe pseudo-file behaves differently from regular symbolic links.

Most databases have utilities to do bulk insert operations, some even expose those libraries to code as well if using command line utilities and batch files seem old fashioned.\n\nIf it's an insert/update/delete type of scenario, bulk insert into a staging table and then use RDMS specific technology to update the target table. \n\nFor example, SQL Server provides a nice [MERGE](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522522(v=sql.105).aspx) command to merge data to a target.\n\nBulk inserting 100,000 records will only take a second or so.

My aim is to perform a meta analysis on the prevalence data.\n\nI have transformed the proportions, and found confidence intervals using the transformed data.\n\nI have a forest plot with CIs calculated exactly, and another with CIs calculated after a backtransformation. The largest difference between the two sets is 0\\.07, so they are very similar. \n\nMy issue is deciding whether I should be reporting the exact confidence intervals, or those that have been back transformed. There are ten studies in my data, so an approximation is not appropriate.\n\n**Question:** In order to gain the correct confidence intervals, do I have to perform a back transformation? \n\nI currently have two sets of answers and I'm not sure of the correct method. \n\n**Example:** Let's say I have a proportion: `123/9876`.\n\n(1\\) In calculating the exact CIs without transformation, I get:\n\n```\np=0.01245443; LB=0.01036126; UB=0.01484199\n\n```\n\n(2\\) After transforming the original data, and using `(p-z*SE(p), p+z*SE(p))`, where `SE(p)=sqrt(1/(n+0.5))`, I get:\n\n```\np=0.224109; LB=0.2043868; UB=0.2438312\n\n```\n\n(3\\) Back transforming gives:\n\n```\np=0.01245443; LB=0.01035768; UB=0.01474083\n\n```\n\nBut which of these three results is correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Wilson score interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval) is a simple and accurate confidence interval for the binomial proportion parameter, that automatically adjusts near the boundaries of the range. The coverage properties of various intervals have been examined in [Brown, Cai and DasGupta (2001\\)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-2/Interval-Estimation-for-a-Binomial-Proportion/10.1214/ss/1009213286.full) and this is one of the intervals they recommend as having good coverage properties.\n\nThe interval is constructed as follows. Suppose you observe $N\\_1$ \"successes\" and $N\\_0$ \"failures\" giving a total of $n\\=N\\_0\\+N\\_1$ data points. The Wilson score interval uses the normal approximation to give the following pivotal quantity:\n\n$$\\\\frac{(N\\_1 \\- n \\\\theta)^2}{n\\\\theta (1\\-\\\\theta)} \\\\overset{\\\\text{Approx}}{\\\\sim} \\\\text{ChiSq}(1\\),$$\n\nLetting $\\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2$ denote the critical point (upper tail area of $\\\\alpha$) of the chi\\-squared distribution with one degree\\-of\\-freedom, and solving the resulting quadratic inequality for $\\\\theta$, then gives the probability interval:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\n1\\-\\\\alpha \n\\&\\\\approx \\\\mathbb{P} \\\\Bigg( (N\\_1 \\- n \\\\theta)^2 \\\\leqslant n \\\\theta (1\\-\\\\theta) \\\\cdot \\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2 \\\\Bigg) \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\= \\\\mathbb{P} \\\\Bigg( \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Bigg\\[ \\\\frac{2N\\_1 \\+ \\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2}{2n \\+ \\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2} \\\\pm \\\\frac{n \\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}}{n \\+ \\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N\\_0 N\\_1}{n} \\+ \\\\frac{\\\\chi\\_{\\\\alpha}^2}{4}} \\\\Bigg] \\\\Bigg). \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\\\end{align}$$\n\nSubstitution of the observed values of $n\\_0$ and $n\\_1$ then gives the resulting confidence interval. This confidence interval is implemented in various functions. You can implement this interval in `R` using the `CONF.prop` function from the [`stat.extend` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stat.extend). Here is the interval you get with your data:\n\n```\n#Compute confidence interval using Wilson-score method\nlibrary(stat.extend)\nCONF.prop(alpha = 0.05, sample.prop = 123/9876, n = 9876)\n\nConfidence Interval (CI) \n\n95.00% CI for proportion parameter for infinite population \nInterval uses 9876 binary data points with sample proportion = 0.0125 \n\n[0.0104489771546811, 0.0148390256803883]\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a meta-analysis on prevalence data and has a sample of 123 positive cases out of 9876 total observations.

It is specifically designed for binomial proportions and performs well even with low prevalence rates.\n2. It automatically adjusts near the boundaries of the range (0 and 1), which is important for low proportions.\n3. It has been shown to have good coverage properties in studies comparing different interval estimation methods for binomial proportions.\n4. It doesn't require transformations or back-transformations, which can introduce complications or approximations.\n5. It's more accurate than the normal approximation method, especially for small samples or extreme proportions.\n\nOption A (exact binomial) can be computationally intensive and may be overly conservative. \nOption B (Freeman-Tukey transformation) introduces additional steps and potential for error in back-transformation. \nOption D (simple normal approximation) can perform poorly for extreme proportions like in this case.\n\nThe Wilson score interval provides a good balance of simplicity, accuracy, and appropriateness for this type of data."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/04/09", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/739549", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/314206/"], "docs_id": 739549, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I once had a fresh installation of Win7 on an SSD drive.

This method allows for precise control over which polygons are merged, as opposed to using automatic processes that might not accurately capture the desired groupings. The documentation explicitly mentions this tool and provides step-by-step instructions for its use in both QGIS and ArcGIS.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the standard \"Dissolve\" tool typically combines all polygons with the same attribute value, which may not achieve the desired result of merging only specific neighboring polygons.\n\nOption C is not ideal because SQL queries are typically used for selecting data rather than editing geometry, and may not provide the necessary control for this specific merging task.\n\nOption D would be an unnecessary step, as creating a new field and using the Field Calculator doesn't directly solve the problem of merging specific polygons.\n\nThe \"Merge selected features\" tool allows for manual selection and merging of exactly the polygons needed, making it the most suitable option for the given scenario."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/24", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/49295", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4918/"], "docs_id": 49295, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read about precompiling the preamble in <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/15606/4918> and it worked fine with `pdflatex` but how can I do this for `xelatex`?\n\nI tried\n\n```\nxelatex -ini -shell-escape -job-name=\"header\" \"&xelatex header.tex\\dump\"\n\n```\n\nbut it ends with an error:\n\n```\n!

The MultiViews option, which is enabled by default on OS X, can interfere with URL rewriting rules. This option causes Apache to search for files that match the requested URL, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.\n\nIn this case, when accessing '/category/2/', Apache finds 'category.php' and redirects everything after the slash to that file, preventing the RewriteRule from working as intended.

This design consumes 269k logic blocks, exceeding the FPGA's capacity.

We probably get \u201cwhinny,\u201d or horse talk, from the same root.\n> * Both words are very old; \u201cwhine\u201d dates from 1275 and \u201cwhinge\u201d from 1150\\. Originally, \u201cwhine\u201d referred merely to the sound. But \u201cwhinge\u201d implied a wailing or crying: the sound was one of distress. Eventually, to \u201cwhine\u201d also came to mean complain or express discontent.\n> * ***Though Americans use only one word, \u201cwhine,\u201d the British use both:*** \u201cwhining\u201d covers a variety of meanings, including sounds made by people, animals, or inanimate objects, and \u201cwhingeing\u201d (also spelled \u201cwhinging\u201d) is more specifically for peevish or fretful complaining.

While we find hundreds of instances of *whinge* used in U.K., Irish, and Australian news publications over the last few months, North American publications contain only a few scattered examples. Meanwhile, our American spell check catches *whinge*, our American dictionaries list it as British, and an unscientific poll we conducted suggests that some Americans have no knowledge of the word.\n> * *Whinge* is old. The OED lists examples from as far back as 1150\\. *Whing* was the preferred spelling from around the 17th century until only recently, and *whinge* now prevails by a large margin. According to an Ngram graphing the use of both spellings, this started around 1980\\.\n> * ***In either form, the word was rare until the last few decades.

I'm interested in useful algorithms and efficient data structures, and speed is more important than memory consumption as long as the latter is kept to a reasonable level.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **SQL solution**\n\nYou could load all the demographic data into an SQL database: \n\n```\nCREATE TABLE PERSON(Id integer PRIMARY KEY, zip text, birth date, gender char /*... */);\n...\n\n```\n\nUnfortunately the file importing statement is not SQL standard (e.g. [`BULK INSERT`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx) for SQLServer, [`LOAD DATA INFILE`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14330314/3723423) for mysql, or use [SQL\\*Loader](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B25329_01/doc/admin.102/b25107/impexp.htm#BCEEBGAJ) for Oracle). \n\nThe easiest and most efficient way would then be to use aggregate functions with a [`GROUP BY`](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) clause to count number of persons sharing the same values for the grouping columns, and keeping only those with duplicates, using a [`HAVING`](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp) clause: \n\n```\nSELECT zip, birth, gender, count(*) FROM PERSON \n   GROUP BY zip, birth, gender\n   HAVING count(*)>1;\n\n```\n\n[Online demo](https://goo.gl/ZLQGqA)\n\n**Sorted file solution**\n\nYou could als get your census file sorted by zip, birth and gender. Then you could read the data, compare each record read to the previous one, and if the same, and count until these value change for a record. \n\nPseudocode:\n\n```\nlastrecord = {  };\ncounter = 1; \nwhile there's a record to read {\n    read record \n    if (record.zip == lastrecord.zip \n          and record.birth==lastreacord.birth \n          and record.gender == lastrecord.gender) {\n       counter = counter +1; \n    } \n    else {\n         if (counter>1)  {    // output the count of duplicates\n               write lastrecord.zip, lastrecord.birth, lastrecord.gender, counter\n         }  \n         counter =1; \n    }      \n    lastrecord = record; \n}\nif (counter>1)  {    // output the count of duplicates\n     write lastrecord.zip, lastrecord.birth, lastrecord.gender, \n}\n\n```\n\n**Associative map**\n\nA last way, here would be to read each record as it comes, and store the 3 tuple values in a map: \n\n* store 1 if the tuple was not yet loaded\n* increment existing tuple value if it already exists\n\nIn the end, iterate trough the map and process the elements having a count greater than 1\\.

When \u03c9D < \u03c90, the denominator in the tan(\u03c6) equation is positive, making \u03c6 positive, which means the oscillator's response lags behind the driving force.\n\nD) Incorrect. At \u03c9D = \u03c90, the phase difference actually undergoes a rapid change from leading to lagging, not reaching a maximum.\n\nThe correct answer is based on the behavior of the phase difference equation and the graph provided in the documentation, which shows the transition from leading to lagging phase at \u03c9D = \u03c90."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/15", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/321762", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/51457/"], "docs_id": 321762, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The size column tells me the capacity of the drive but not the amount of disk used.\n\nHow do I determine how much data is on a mount point in 2008 R2?

What does 'You are the man!' truly mean?**\n\nWhen `You the man!` or `you da man` is used as an idiom what the Cambridge dictionary says is correct. If you are intending on using the idiom, leave out the `are`.\n\nThe Cambridge Dictionary puts it well, but is perhaps a bit too general:\n\n> used to praise a person who has done something well\n\nThe word praise is too general in my opinion. This idiom is used often to congratulate or thank someone someone for being skilled or doing something well immediately after they have done it.\n\nWhat does it truly mean? It's all down to context and how it's used. In some cases it might be used to congratulate or thank someone for their excellence, or to express more general praise. I think the most important part of the phrase is the definite article 'the'. It is saying that:\n\n> You THE man\n\nAs distinct from all the other men. Some might say that it is similar or the same as saying:\n\n> You are the first or best of all men.\n\n**2/3\\. Can it be used for a woman, can we say 'she is the man'?**\n\nIn my opinion, no, because it is a gender specific idiom. Using it in reference to a woman may suggest that a woman can only be the best if she is a man. Women may find that offensive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the idiomatic expression \"You the man!\" in American English?\n\nA) It's a formal way to address a male superior in a professional setting.\nB) It's a gender-neutral phrase used to praise anyone for a job well done.\nC) It's an informal expression used specifically to congratulate or thank a man for demonstrating skill or excellence, typically immediately after an action.\nD) It's a phrase that can be equally applied to men and women to indicate their superiority in a given field.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The idiom \"You the man!\" is an informal expression used specifically to congratulate or thank a man for demonstrating skill or excellence, typically immediately after an action. It's more specific than general praise and is gender-specific.\n\nA is incorrect because this phrase is informal, not formal, and isn't used to address superiors in professional settings.\n\nB is incorrect because the phrase is not gender-neutral.
