I would also like to increase the indent of footnotes in minipages only. This is handy after tables, for instance.\n\nIdeally, I would use the `footmisc` package with the `norule` option, but this affects the entire document, and not only the minipage environments. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assume that columns B, C, and D are of the `p` type with *usable* widths given by the length parameters `\\colB`, `\\colC`, and `\\colD`. In your example code, these lengths are equal to `2cm` each. The *total* widths of columns B, C, and D are, however, *not* equal to `2cm`. Instead, each column's total width equals `2cm+2\\tabcolsep`, where `\\tabcolsep` is the parameter that governs the amount of whitespace inserted to the left and right of a column. (In the standard LaTeX document classes, the default value of this parameter is `6pt`.)\n\nThe *combined* width of columns B, C, and D \\-\\- not counting the widths of the vertical bars to the left of B and to the right of D \\-\\- is \n\n```\n\\colB + \\colC + \\colD + 6\\tabcolsep + 2\\arrayrulewidth \n\n```\n\n(I'm assuming, implicitly, that the `array` package is being loaded. If that's not the case, then one should omit the `2\\arrayrulewidth` term.) You can probably guess that `2\\arrayrulewidth` represents the combined widths of the two interior vertical bars \\-\\- those separating B from C and C from D. The default value of this parameter is `0.4pt` in the standard document classes.\n\nThe *usable* width of the three columns is a bit smaller, since we mustn't impose on `\\tabcolsep` at the left\\-hand edge of B and at the right\\-hand edge of D. It is thus given by \n\n```\n\\colB + \\colC + \\colD + 4\\tabcolsep + 2\\arrayrulewidth\n\n```\n\nOne can create a length variable called, say, `\\combinedlength` and set its value to the expression above.

But you have tripped yourself up by not following your sign convention rigorously. Remember that since the $y$ axis is positive in the upwards direction then when you add the mass to the spring the displacement is a negative number, because it is a displacement in the downwards direction. So if we call the displacement $d$ then $d \\\\lt 0$.\n\nOnce you remember this you'll find your original equation:\n\n$$ F\\_y\\=\\-kd\\-mg\\=0 $$\n\nworks correctly. In the first term the displacement $d$ is a negative number so since $k$ is positive we find $\\-kd$ is a positive number i.e. it is an upwards force exactly as it should be.\n\nWhat I suspect you have done is to take the displacement as $\\-d$, so the displacement is overall negative but the number $d$ is positive.

Thus, there can be in the extension no *fresh* subsets of a larger regular cardinal $\\\\alpha$, where $A\\\\subset\\\\alpha$ is *fresh* over $V$ if $A\\\\notin V$ but all initial segments of $A$ below $\\\\alpha$ are in $V$. \n\nYour iteration admits a closure point at the least inaccessible, and so it can add no fresh subsets above the least inaccessible. In particular, it adds no $V$\\-generic Cohen sets using $\\\\text{Add}(\\\\alpha,1\\)^V$, since this forcing would add a fresh subset of $\\\\alpha$.\n\nYou can find details in my paper *Joel David Hamkins*, [**Extensions with the approximation and cover properties have no new large cardinals**](http://dx.doi.org/10.4064/fm180-3-4), *Fund.

The scripts have been working well, but are now failing on a Jenkins build server with the error \"unshare: cannot change root filesystem propagation: Invalid argument\". What is the most likely cause of this issue and how can it potentially be resolved?\n\nA) The Jenkins server lacks the necessary permissions to use mount namespaces. The solution is to grant root access to the Jenkins user.\n\nB) The build script is being executed inside a Jenkins chroot environment, which is restricting the use of mount namespaces. The developer needs to modify the Jenkins configuration to disable the chroot plugin.\n\nC) The unshare command is not installed on the Jenkins server. The solution is to install the util-linux package that provides the unshare command.\n\nD) The build script is not properly detecting the current namespace. The developer should modify the script to use a different method for checking the mount namespace.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question describes a scenario where build scripts that use mount namespaces are failing specifically on a Jenkins build server. The error message \"cannot change root filesystem propagation\" is a strong indicator that the script is running in a restricted environment. \n\nThe documentation mentions that the build script is likely being executed inside a Jenkins chroot environment, which explains why the unshare command is failing. Chroot environments often have limitations on certain system operations for security reasons.\n\nOption B correctly identifies this as the probable cause and suggests a potential solution by modifying the Jenkins configuration to disable the chroot plugin. This would allow the script to run in a less restricted environment where it can use mount namespaces as intended.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\nA) While permissions can be an issue, the specific error doesn't indicate a permissions problem.\nC) The error message shows that unshare is present but failing, not missing.\nD) The namespace detection part of the script isn't causing the error; it's the actual unshare command that's failing."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/04/24", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/236839", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/86700/"], "docs_id": 236839, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in a meeting with a client later on, regarding an ASP.NET web app we are creating for him.

Also, large number of pins will mean that even when the solder melts you have to pull the (now very hot) part off the board, which is not easy.\n\nOne solution is to use a coping saw or similar to slice up the jack, and pliers to crush and break the plastic parts. If you can reduce it to individual pins soldered into holes you should be able to remove them one by one.\n\nThe high power hot air guns you get for stripping paint would also get everything hot enough, but might overheat or blow away nearby components if they are not protected somehow.\n\nI also think it should be possible to use hot air and soldering iron to do this, but it would be tricky. You need a large tip to get the heat flowing, and adding more solder can also help transfer heat. Use the hot air to preheat the jack, and surrounding area of the board \\- ideally from both sides.

If $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha) \\\\subseteq \\\\phi(\\\\beta)$, it thus follows that $C\\_{\\\\alpha} \\\\subseteq C\\_{\\\\beta}$, and that they have the same order\\-type (which is a regular ordinal), which implies they have the same limit, so $\\\\alpha \\= \\\\beta$.\n\n---\n\nThis works when there are no inaccessible cardinals, and one can introduce further rules to provide a construction which works under the weaker hypothesis that there are no hyper\\-inaccessible cardinals.

Let me prove this conclusion under\na weaker hypothesis, a large cardinal assumption weaker than VP.\nSpecifically, I claim that if there is a stationary proper class\nof Woodin cardinals, then there is no such $\\\\phi$ as in the\nquestion.\n\nThe assumption that there is a stationary proper class of Woodin\ncardinals is strictly weaker in consistency strength than a supercompact cardinal, which\nis strictly less than an extendible cardinal, which is strictly\nless than Vop\u011bnka's principle (assuming consistency).\n\nLet's begin. Suppose that the Woodin cardinals form a stationary\nproper class, and suppose that $\\\\phi:\\\\text{Ord}\\\\to V$ is a\nfunction with the stated properties. Since there is a closed\nunbounded set of $\\\\delta$ with $\\\\phi''\\\\delta\\\\subset V\\_\\\\delta$,\nthere must be such a $\\\\delta$ that is a Woodin cardinal. Consider\n$\\\\phi\\\\upharpoonright\\\\delta:\\\\delta\\\\to V\\_\\\\delta$. Since $\\\\delta$ is\nWoodin, there is $\\\\kappa\\<\\\\delta$ such that there is an elementary\nembedding $j:V\\\\to M$ with critical point $\\\\kappa$ and for which\n$j(\\\\phi)$ and $\\\\phi$ agree up to and including $\\\\kappa$. In\nparticular, $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)$.\n\nConsider now the elements of $\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$. If we have a natural\nnumber $n\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, then by elementarity, we have\n$n\\=j(n)\\\\in j(\\\\phi(\\\\kappa))\\=j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. And if there is\n$x\\\\in \\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$ that is not a natural number, then\n$x\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)$ for some $\\\\beta\\<\\\\kappa$. By our assumption on $j$,\nwe know $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\=x$. Since\n$\\\\phi(\\\\beta)\\\\in\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, it follows by elementarity that\n$j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\beta))\\=j(\\\\phi)(\\\\beta)\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$, which\nmeans $x\\\\in j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. Thus, we've shown\n$\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset j(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. But since\n$j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\=\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$, this means $j(\\\\phi)(\\\\kappa)\\\\subset\nj(\\\\phi)(j(\\\\kappa))$. So $j(\\\\phi)$ sometimes has inclusion\ncomparable elements, and by elementarity there must be\n$\\\\alpha\\<\\\\kappa$ with $\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)\\\\subset\\\\phi(\\\\kappa)$,\ncontradicting one of the properties of $\\\\phi$. **QED**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Suppose there exists a function-class \u03c6 whose domain is the class of ordinals, satisfying the following properties:\n1) If x \u2208 \u03c6(\u03b1), then either x \u2208 \u2115 or there exists some ordinal \u03b2 < \u03b1 with \u03c6(\u03b2) = x\n2) If \u03c6(\u03b1) \u2286 \u03c6(\u03b2), then \u03b1 = \u03b2\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nA) The existence of such a function-class \u03c6 is provable in ZFC without additional axioms\nB) The existence of such a function-class \u03c6 contradicts the existence of inaccessible cardinals\nC) The existence of such a function-class \u03c6 contradicts Vop\u011bnka's principle\nD) The existence of such a function-class \u03c6 is consistent with ZFC and the existence of inaccessible cardinals\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The existence of such a function-class \u03c6 contradicts Vop\u011bnka's principle, and in fact, contradicts even weaker large cardinal assumptions.

Through algebraic manipulation, we can show that this is equivalent to e^x = 1/(1-e^c) - 1. \n\nSince c < 0, we know that 0 < e^c < 1, which implies 0 < 1-e^c < 1.

The command `mp4tags -i \"movie\" <filename>` sets the \"media kind\" tag to \"movie\", which will cause iTunes to place it in the \"Movies\" section.

In Swift iOS programming I could create a pList (flat\\-file) or store settings in the NSUserDefaults. I'm just wondering what my options are in ASP.NET MVC. \n\nI originally wanted to ask \"What's the best way to implement admin/owner settings?\" but I didn't want my question closed as being subjective. I am, however, hoping to deduce what the preferred method is ultimately to adhere to best practices.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My experience is that the \"settings\" supported by C\\# out of the box are not very useful.\n\nStoring the settings in the database is a much better idea for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It will be possible to take a complete backup of the blog by backing up the database without having to remember what other files you need.\n2. If you one day decide to take this system of yours, which currently implements a single blog for a single user, and turn it into a blogging platform supporting many blogs operated by multiple users, you will just create multiple settings records, one for each user, and at least that part will be taken care of. With a settings file, such a thing would be impossible, you would certainly have to rewrite your settings mechanism to make use of the database at that point.\n3. Your settings may need to refer to rows in the database, in which case it only makes sense to also store the settings in the database in order to enjoy the benefits of referential integrity checking. For example, you may wish to add a setting for a \"sticky post\" which is to always be displayed first, regardless of how old it is. If you go with a settings file, then the \"sticky post id\" setting will be just a meaningless number, interpreted by your code to (hopefully) correspond to a blog post. If you store your settings in the database, then the RDBMS will ensure that this number will in fact be the actual id of an existing row in the blog posts table. (Or NULL, if you don't want a sticky post.)\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nThe way this is usually accomplished is by having a settings table with a single row in it. This is not just a wild idea that you had, it is a legitimate technique which has actual application in the real world.\n\nThere is no way to guarantee that additional rows will never be accidentally added to the settings table, but at least you can count the rows during startup and display an error message if more than one row is found.\n\nYou can easily guarantee that there will always be only one instance of the settings object by adding a `private static bool` member to it, and `Assert`ing from the constructor of the object that this `bool` is `false`, then setting it to `true`. This means that the constructor may only be invoked once."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating a blog system and wants to implement customizable settings for the admin.

The documentation recommends using a database table with a single row to store all settings. This approach offers benefits such as easier backups, potential for future scalability, and the ability to reference other database entities.

I was disillusioned and reluctant to look for more fish in the sea\\- my work ethic dropped to zero.\n\n**I fell in love again:** but too late\\- algebraic topology/ differential geometry hit me in my fourth year like a simplicial arrow from cupid's own bow but by this time, my grades blew and all the people I knew in the department were DS theorists. I got a 2:1 (for all you non\\-UK MOers\\- it's a degree class that's basically a rubber stamp with the word 'mediocre' on it).\n\n**I tried teaching school kids:** not enough cohomology.\n\n**I've got myself a year, a jolly good library and a lot of determination:** My aim being to produce something so intriguing/charming/advanced that someone will give me funding to do pure maths.\n\n### Question\n\n> So what, if anything, should I try to produce?\n\n**Specifically:** Would I have to solve some grand unsolved problem? Would I get by with just a small one? If so, where would I find it? Perhaps even a complete set of excercises from an advanced book?

A 2\\.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption.\n\nTaking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of \"intriguing/charming/advanced\" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by [Terry Tao.](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)\n\nThere is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community.\n\nThere are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues.

You can try [liquid hammer](http://www.sbsconcreteproducts.com/liquid-hammer.html). My guys use this to clean their wheel barrows and tools from concrete and it really works. However I am not sure it is suitable for pipes. But really what do you have to lose? I would contact the manufacturer of liquid hammer and ask them if you can pour it down a drain legally and what effect it will have on those pipes (my guess is your pipes will last). Then pour if it is legal and see if first if your main clog is gone and then later if there are no issues with your main line.

The documentation clearly states that DPS is not affected by game difficulty. Instead, it's calculated using the formula: DPS = Base Damage * Damage Modifier(s). The base damage comes from the weapon, while modifiers come from skills and stats (like the primary stat giving a 1% damage increase per point). The huge difference in DPS is likely due to higher-level players having weapons with much higher base damage and more points in their primary stat, resulting in significantly higher damage modifiers.

As usual we can turn $V\\\\otimes V$ or $V\\\\otimes V\\\\otimes V$ into Hilbert spaces by intorducing the natural inner product and by performing completion.\n\nQuestion 1\\. We have a sequence of simple tensors $f\\_{i}\\\\otimes g\\_{i}$ that converges in the Hilbert space $V\\\\otimes V$ to some tensor. Is it true that the limit is a simple tensor, that is can be represented by $f\\\\otimes g$? The matter is that $f\\_{i}$ and $g\\_{i}$ need not have limits, as the simple example $i f\\\\otimes\\\\frac{1}{i} g$, for some fixed $f,g\\\\in V$ shows.\n\nQuestion 2\\. If a sequence of simple tensors of the form $f\\_{i}\\\\otimes f\\_{i}\\\\otimes g\\_{i}$ has a limit which is a simple tensor, can it be represented by $f\\\\otimes f\\\\otimes g$, for some $f,g\\\\in V$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under the natural identification of the completion of $V\\\\otimes W$ with Hilbert\\-Schmidt operators $V\\\\rightarrow W^\\*$, monomial tensors give rank\\-one operators.

In this case, we're dealing with V\u2297V\u2297V, which can be viewed as V\u2297(V\u2297V). Under this identification, simple tensors correspond to rank-one operators.\n\nA limit in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of rank-one operators will be a finite-rank operator, but not necessarily rank-one. This means the limit tensor isn't always simple (ruling out A and B), but it will always correspond to a finite-rank operator (hence D is correct).\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the limit does correspond to a finite-rank operator, it may not be expressible as a finite sum of simple tensors in V\u2297V\u2297V.\n\nThis question tests understanding of tensor products in Hilbert spaces, their completion, and the connection to Hilbert-Schmidt operators, making it a challenging problem suitable for an advanced exam."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/14", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/155483", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/84109/"], "docs_id": 155483, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question is about anything really.

While data transferred between servers is protected by multiple checksums, there is still a very small possibility that multi-bit errors could pass through the ethernet, IP, and TCP checksums. This means that over a large number of transfers, there's a minute chance that a PNG file could experience data corruption.

Even the, EM energies are the kinetic energy of quantum particles such as photons.\n\nThis is simply incorrect, and starting with this incorrect premise may be the reason for your confusion.\n\nGravitational potential energy and electrostatic potential energy are both examples of non\\-kinetic energy that is eligible to do work. In a purely electrostatic field (as opposed to a dynamic electromagnetic field) there are no real photons with the usual KE and momentum relationship typical of photons (i.e. on shell).\n\n> The velocity of an particle can be defined as the change of its space as the time changes or change in its spacetime respect to an observer.\n\nI have never seen any example where any professional physicist refers to the velocity of a particle as the \"change in its spacetime\". I would not recommend using this terminology as it is almost guaranteed to cause confusion.\n\n> So my question is, Is energy only the change in spacetime of an object with respect to an observer?\n\nReplacing the strange terminology \"change in spacetime\" with the standard terminology \"velocity\" this question becomes:\n\n\"Is energy only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer?\"\n\nThe answer is an emphatic \"No\"! Energy is not only the velocity of an object with respect to an observer. Even kinetic energy is $\\\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ which includes mass as well as velocity. So this idea does not work even strictly for kinetic energy. However, as mentioned above, energy is more than just kinetic energy.\n\nThe usual way to define energy is through [Noether's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem). This is probably the single most important theoretical result in all of physics. Noether's theorem shows that continuous symmetries of the action result in a conserved quantity. In the case of energy, [energy is the conserved quantity due to the time\\-translation symmetry of the action](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/%7Ekleinert/b6/psfiles/Chapter-7-conslaw.pdf).\n\nA typical Lagrangian of a point particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V$ would be $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\- V(x)$$ this Lagrangian is time invariant, so applying Noether's theorem gives the conserved energy $$H\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot x^2 \\+ V(x)$$ which is not just the velocity $\\\\dot x$, it also includes the mass $m$ and the potential energy $V$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about energy in physics is most accurate?\n\nA) Energy is solely determined by the velocity of an object relative to an observer.\n\nB) Only kinetic energy is capable of performing work in physical systems.\n\nC) Energy is the conserved quantity resulting from the time-translation symmetry of the action, as described by Noether's Theorem.\n\nD) Electromagnetic energies are exclusively the kinetic energy of photons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because energy is not solely determined by velocity. Even kinetic energy involves mass (1/2mv^2).\n\nOption B is false as potential energies (e.g., gravitational, electrostatic) can also perform work.\n\nOption C is correct.

Then it search for `'0'` and replaces it with the string `'-1 -1 -1 -1'`. \n\nWith integers, not characters:\n\n```\nencodedData = [1 0 1 1];\nreshape(bsxfun(@minus, 2*encodedData, ones(4,1)), 1, [])\nans =    \n   1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1\n\n```\n\nAnd, if you have MATLAB R2015a or later then there's [`repelem`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/repelem.html) as Luis mentioned in a comment:\n\n```\nrepelem(2*encodedData-1, 4)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the following MATLAB code snippet:\n\n```matlab\nencodedData = [1 0 1 1];\nresult = reshape(bsxfun(@minus, 2*encodedData, ones(4,1)), 1, []);\n```\n\nWhat will be the value of the 'result' variable?\n\nA) [1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\nB) [2 2 2 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]\nC) [1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1]\nD) [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This code performs the following operations:\n1.
