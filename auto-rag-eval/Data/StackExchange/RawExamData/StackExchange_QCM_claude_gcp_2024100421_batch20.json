I plan to use `rsync` to copy them to the EHD, but I wonder if it's necessary to transfer them in the so called \"archive mode\" (using the `-a` flag), since, as I understand, the main purpose of this mode is to preserve permissions, ownerships, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's the right way to use `-a` .

While the tar files themselves may have permissions preserved, using the -a flag with rsync ensures that these permissions are maintained during the transfer. Additionally, the archive mode includes other useful features like recursion (-r), preserving symlinks (-l), modification times (-t), and group information (-g). \n\nMost importantly, using the -a flag sets up rsync to efficiently handle future synchronizations. If you need to update the files on the external hard drive later, rsync will only transfer the changes, saving time and bandwidth. This makes option C the most accurate and comprehensive answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the tar files have permissions preserved, using -a provides additional benefits. Option B is wrong as there are clear advantages to using -a. Option D is misleading because the benefits of -a apply regardless of whether you plan to modify the files."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/25", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/264016", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/91142/"], "docs_id": 264016, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a set of 150 features, and many of them are highly correlated with each other. My goal is to predict the value of a discrete variable, whose range is **1\\-8**. My sample size is **550**, and I am using **10\\-fold** cross\\-validation. \n\nAFAIK, among the regularization methods (Lasso, ElasticNet, and Ridge), Ridge is more rigorous to correlation among the features. That is why I expected that with Ridge, I should obtain a more accurate prediction. However, my results show that the mean absolute error of Lasso or Elastic is around **0\\.61** whereas this score is **0\\.97** for the ridge regression. I wonder what would be an explanation for this. Is this because I have many features, and Lasso performs better because it makes a sort of feature selection, getting rid of the redundant features?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose you have two highly correlated predictor variables $x,z$, and suppose both are centered and scaled (to mean zero, variance one). Then the ridge penalty on the parameter vector is $\\\\beta\\_1^2 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2^2$ while the lasso penalty term is $ \\\\mid \\\\beta\\_1 \\\\mid \\+ \\\\mid \\\\beta\\_2 \\\\mid$. Now, since the model is supposed highly colinear, so that $x$ and $z$ more or less can substitute each other in predicting $Y$, so many linear combination of $x, z$ where we simply substitute in part $x$ for $z$, will work very similarly as predictors, for example $0\\.2 x \\+ 0\\.8 z, 0\\.3 x \\+ 0\\.7 z$ or $0\\.5 x \\+ 0\\.5 z$ will be about equally good as predictors. Now look at these three examples, the lasso penalty in all three cases are equal, it is 1, while the ridge penalty differ, it is respectively 0\\.68, 0\\.58, 0\\.5, so the ridge penalty will prefer equal weighting of colinear variables while lasso penalty will not be able to choose. This is one reason ridge (or more generally, elastic net, which is a linear combination of lasso and ridge penalties) will work better with colinear predictors: When the data give little reason to choose between different linear combinations of colinear predictors, lasso will just \"wander\" while ridge tends to choose equal weighting. That last might be a better guess for use with future data! And, if that is so with present data, could show up in cross validation as better results with ridge.\n\nWe can view this in a Bayesian way: Ridge and lasso implies different prior information, and the prior information implied by ridge tend to be more reasonable in such situations. (This explanation here I learned , more or less, from the book: \"Statistical Learning with Sparsity The Lasso and Generalizations\" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Martin Wainwright, but at this moment I was not able to find a direct quote).\n\n---\n\nBut the OP seems to have a different problem: \n\n> However, my results show that the mean absolute error of Lasso or\n>  Elastic is around **0\\.61** whereas this score is **0\\.97** for the\n>  ridge regression\n\nNow, lasso is also effectively doing variable selection, it can set some coefficients exactly to zero. Ridge cannot do that (except with probability zero.) So it might be that with the OP data, among the colinear variables, some are effective and others don't act at all (and the degree of colinearity sufficiently low that this can be detected.)

The target variable is discrete with a range of 1-8, and the sample size is 550. After applying different regularization methods with 10-fold cross-validation, the data scientist observes that Lasso and ElasticNet achieve a mean absolute error of about 0.61, while Ridge regression results in a mean absolute error of 0.97. Which of the following statements best explains this unexpected outcome?\n\nA) Ridge regression is always superior to Lasso for handling correlated features, so the results must be erroneous.\n\nB) The large number of features relative to the sample size is causing Ridge regression to overfit, while Lasso's feature selection capability is beneficial in this scenario.\n\nC) The discrete nature of the target variable inherently favors Lasso over Ridge regression.\n\nD) Ridge regression performs poorly when the number of features exceeds the number of samples, regardless of feature correlation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While Ridge regression is generally considered more robust when dealing with correlated features, the scenario described presents a case where Lasso's feature selection capability provides an advantage. With 150 features and only 550 samples, there's a high feature-to-sample ratio. Lasso can effectively perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, which can be beneficial when there are many features relative to the sample size. This helps in reducing model complexity and potentially improving generalization. \n\nRidge regression, on the other hand, doesn't set coefficients to exactly zero, which means it keeps all features in the model. In a scenario with many features and potential redundancy, this could lead to overfitting or reduced performance compared to Lasso.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Ridge is often good for correlated features, it's not always superior, especially in high-dimensional settings with potential irrelevant features.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the discrete nature of the target variable doesn't inherently favor Lasso over Ridge.\n\nOption D is too absolute and incorrect.

Every processing step independent from the other ones and consoists of a small amount of code, 5\\-15 lines in general. These are mostly wrappers to JAI, AWT and so on.\n\nMy current design is an abstract class:\n\n```\npublic abstract class AbstractPreProcessingStep {\n    protected Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName());\n\n    protected AbstractPreProcessingStep() {\n    };\n\n    public abstract BufferedImage startProcessing(BufferedImage input);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nEvery processing step implements this class and can be called uniform. (like the Strategy\\-Pattern).\n\nSince every processing step may have a different set of parameters, I created a factory class, like this:\n\n```\npublic class PreProcessingFactory {\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createColorInverter() {\n        return new ColorInverter();\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createRescaler(float rescaleFactor) {\n        return new Rescaler(rescaleFactor);\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createEdgeDetector() {\n        return new EdgeDetector();\n    }\n\n    public static AbstractPreProcessingStep createBlackAndWhite() {\n        return new BlackAndWhite();\n    }\n...\n\n```\n\nSo, if you want to create a black and white image with inverted colors, you need to do this (pseude code)\n\n```\nbw = PreProcessingFactory.createBlackAndWhite();\ninv = PreProcessingFactory.createInverter();\nresult = bw.startProcessing(result);\nresult = inv.startProcessing(result);\n\n```\n\nIn my mind, this is a good design since the implementation details are hidden and new processing steps can easily be add by adding a new class.\n\nThe other approach which was in my mind was to create a single class with every step as a static method \\- however, I've got dislike of 'static'\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll make the following assumptions about your process:\n\n1. One step does not need to know about the inner workings of another step.\n2. Order of these steps is significant (you don't obtain the same results performing these operations in the opposite order).\n\nIn this situation, I can only really tell you what I would do. I would avoid Factory pattern, simply because it implies you must have a factory method for every type of phase, and if you wanted to invent new stages, you'd also have to modify the factory as well. Plus while it may be manageable in bite\\-sized pieces, if you had to deal with 50 phases, even if it didn't change often, it would still be very messy. Not to mention that factory would seem to imply that order is irrelevant. It makes you think that you can make any number of `AbstractPreProcessingStep`s and apply them in however order you wish. Even if that is not the case, I think it is generally better to present an interface which does not mislead a programmer.\n\nConsider the following alternative pattern: [Chain of responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern)\n\nSuppose you had class AbstractProcessor as such:\n\n```\npublic abstract class AbstractProcessor {\n    protected AbstractProcessor step;\n\n    public void setNextStep(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        this.step = step;\n    }\n\n    public abstract BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input);\n}\n\n```\n\nThen you could have your steps as such:\n\n```\npublic class ColorInverter extends AbstractProcessor {\n    public ColorInverter(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        setNextStep(step);\n    }\n\n    public BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input) {\n        // Perform color inverter process here\n        return step != null ? step.process(output) : output;\n    }\n}\npublic class Rescaler extends AbstractProcessor {\n    public Rescaler(AbstractProcessor step) {\n        setNextStep(step);\n    }\n\n    public BufferedImage process(BufferedImage input) {\n        // Perform rescalar process here\n        return step != null ? step.process(output) : output;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nJust like this, it is beautiful in its simplicity, however, you could override ordering for steps which must be performed at the end simply by calling \"`step.process(input)`\" and performing some operation on the returned result. \n\nAlso, if there were specific phases, you could override `AbstractProcessor`'s `setNextStep` to require a certain type of `AbstractProcessor` to guarantee that certain phases are achieved. Take for example the following:\n\n```\npublic abstract class RasteringProcessingStep extends AbstractProcessor { \n    public void setNextStep(RasteringProcessingStep step) {\n        super.setNextStep(step);\n    }\n    public void setNextStep(PostProcessingStep step) {\n        super.setNextStep(step);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this way, you ensure that any step implementing `RasteringProcessingStep` must either be followed by another `RasteringProcessingStep` or it must be followed by a `PostProcessingStep` which also derives from `AbstractPreProcessingStep`.\n\nTo use it, you would see something like:\n\n```\nAbstractProcessor processor = new ColorInverter(new Rescaler(null));\nFile image = new File(\"strawberry.jpg\");\nBufferedImage output = processor.process(ImageIO.read(image));\n\n```\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this approach."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of image processing operations, which design pattern is most appropriate for implementing a series of independent processing steps that need to be applied in a specific order, while allowing for easy addition of new steps and maintaining flexibility in step composition?\n\nA) Factory Pattern\nB) Strategy Pattern\nC) Chain of Responsibility Pattern\nD) Singleton Pattern\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) Factory Pattern: While this pattern can create different processing steps, it doesn't inherently manage the order of operations or allow for easy composition of steps.

Clear the var/generation directory and flush the cache.\nD) The constructor parameters are in the wrong order.

This can happen when changes are made to a class constructor but the generated files are not updated.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to clear the var/generation directory, which will force Magento to regenerate these files with the updated constructor information. You can do this by running the command:\n\nrm -rf var/generation/*\n\nor, more specifically for your module:\n\nrm -rf var/generation/vendor/yourmodule*\n\nAfter clearing the generated files, you should also flush the Magento cache:\n\nphp bin/magento cache:flush\n\nThis process will ensure that Magento regenerates the necessary files with the correct constructor information, resolving the dependency injection issue."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/207743", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1177/"], "docs_id": 207743, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using Gnome 3\\.6 and I am quite annoyed by the login screen when my computer wakes up.

Please redirect me if appropriate.\n\nMy question is very simple, and perhaps partly related to the observations made by several users in [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/482789/computing-statistical-significance-from-experimental-data/482958#482958).\n\nLet me explain the origin of my doubt, in two points.\n\n1. I am assuming that the most important population parameter for public health measures related Covid is the prevalence, i.e. the *percentage* of infected people in a given place.  \n\nThe higher the number of infected people you are likely find in a group of $N$ interacting people, the higher the risk that the infection is transmitted.  \n\nThis would explain why people who are *known* to be infected are subjected to quarantine in many countries, and why meetings in large groups are discouraged or even forbidden.\n2. as far as I can tell \\- and it seems confirmed by the post I linked above \\- you cannot estimate with any accuracy the prevalence of infections in a population if you take a *biased* sample.\n\n**So here is why I find media reports so far very puzzling: they *always* talk about absolute numbers of confirmed cases of infection, rather than prevalence, and *always* without any attempt to correct for bias, although the average number of tests per day has increased enormously since March, and the groups of people being tested are carefully selected by the authorities, thus highly biased.**\n\nA friend of mine, who knows a doctor working in a Covid ward, told me that he had exactly the same reaction to these data continuously being propagated by the media.  \n\nHow can you possibly consider a sentence like 'an extra 100 cases of infection were recorded in the last 24 hours' to mean the same thing, regardless of whether it is based on 10000 tests run on a fairly random population, or instead on 100000 tests run on people coming back from high risk countries?\n\nTo be even more explicit and concrete, if I wanted to know how 'risky' it is to be in an enclosed situation with 100 people (picked randomly) from the population of a city or town, I would have to estimate how many of these 100 people are likely to be infected \\- and for this I need the prevalence.\n\nHow are the figures given by the media of any relevance to this, considering that they are based on absolute numbers obtained from a biased population?  \n\nThere are some websites (sometimes even official government ones) where the number of infections, e.g. per 100000 people, is reported, often subdivided by geographical or administrative criteria. Do you think this is the 'real' prevalence, or is it still based on the biased evidence we seem to have? Do you know of any source of more reliable figures that could be consulted?\n\nI can only hope that the public health protection measures being enforced by various governments are based on real science and on correct data analysis, because frankly the impression one gets from the media is one of confusion, misrepresentation of reality, miscommunication, quite suspiciously as if the actual goal was to create fear, panic and uncertainty and leave people bamboozled into submission to anything that the governments will decide next, regardless of the facts.\n\nI am following the news from a few different European countries, and I can tell you, one day infections were 'up', the next 'down', then 'up' again, for weeks and weeks... Of course! Oscillations are expected, given the way they do tests. Don't you think that continuously switching between 'good' and 'bad' news is like providing no information at all, but just stupid chaos, in the eyes of the non\\-expert?\n\nAnd in practice, given that the authorities test 'high risk' people and quarantine them if they are found to be positive, even if one had the 'real' prevalence, the number of infected people one is likely to meet in a given group is probably lower than the one that could be estimated from it.  \n\nSo I am even less confident that any of what we are being fed by the media has any link to what is really relevant for the control of this infection.\n\nSorry, maybe I am not making sense, and in that case I would be glad if someone set the record straight and corrected me.  \n\nOtherwise, it would be interesting to know where we are going with all this, and why science isn't more prominently contributing at least to the correct representation of the facts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These two methods don't transform the data into normal distribution.

It's just a linear transform, and it doesn't decrease the skew (i.e. skewness, which is already the third standardized moment).\n* Log\\-transform decreases skew in some distributions, especially with large outliers. But, it may not be useful as well if the original distributed is not skewed.

Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Readers: please be patient, eventually the question and answer will hopefully be reduced to some concise content.\n\nOf all the information provided, this is the most relevant:\n\n```\ncpu0: MSR_RAPL_POWER_UNIT: 0x000a0e03 (0.125000 Watts, 0.000061 Joules, 0.000977 sec.)\ncpu0: MSR_PKG_POWER_INFO: 0x00000078 (15 W TDP, RAPL 0 - 0 W, 0.000000 sec.)\ncpu0: MSR_PKG_POWER_LIMIT: 0x42016000dc8090 (UNlocked)\ncpu0: PKG Limit #1: ENabled (18.000000 Watts, 28.000000 sec, clamp DISabled)\ncpu0: PKG Limit #2: DISabled (44.000000 Watts, 0.002441* sec, clamp DISabled)\n...\nBusy%  Bzy_MHz   IRQ  PkgTmp  PkgWatt  GFXWatt   RAMWatt\n99.77   1700     17    55      7.24     0.00      0.00\n\nrdmsr 0x64f\n3d030400\n\n```\n\nIndicating that the processor is currently throttling due to Processor package power limit \\#1, while at the same time the processor is nowhere near package power limit \\#1, at least if we believe what turbostat is telling us.\n\nManually decoding MSR 0x64F gives, among others, bit 10 is set. From the 64\\-ia\\-32\\-architectures\\-software\\-developer\\-manual\\-325462:\n\n> Package/Platform\\-Level Power Limiting PL1 Status (R0\\) When set,\n> frequency is reduced below the operating system request due to\n> package/platform\\-level power limiting PL1\\.\n\nThe other bits are all latched log bits and not relevant just now.\n\nThe RAPL\\_POWER\\_UNIT MSR (0x606\\) gave 0x000a0e03, which does decode correctly to 0\\.125 watts per bit.\n\nThe PKG\\_POWER\\_LIMIT MSR (0x610\\) gave 0x42016000dc8090\\. Let's decode the power limit 1 part manually. Bits 14:0 define the limit, or 90h or 144 decimal. Times .125 \\= 18 watts, as expected. Bit 15 is 1, so it is enabled.\n\nSo, something appears to be wrong and the processor appears to be not behaving the way it should.\n\nCould it be somehow related to the unusually high processor package limit \\#2? Normally it would be set to about 1\\.25 times power limit \\#1\\. such a high value will likely give issues.\n\nEDIT 1: returning to MSR 0x64F, the other latched bits indicate the temperature, PROCHOT (always bad), and \"OTHER\" conditions had previously occurred. Myself, I would turn down power limit 2 from 44 watts to about 22 or 23 watts. Also suggest taking a long slow look at this, coming from the low side of CPU frequency. For example, set a very low CPU maximum frequency:\n\n```\necho 10 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n\n```\n\nand then apply the heavy load, all the while watching with turbostat and watching MSR 0x64f, simultaneously in two terminal windows. Gradually increase the CPU frequency:\n\n```\necho 15 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho 20 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho 25 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n...\n\n```\n\nuntil it throttles.\n\nEDIT 2: Clock Modulation is probably involved, if so likely from the BIOS and likely due to the extraordinarily high setting for power limit \\#2\\. The way to know is to read MSR 0x19A during the odd throttling event. Do `sudo rdmsr -a 0x19a`.

You can always remove that part, in order to remove them manually after verifying your compressed files.\n\nIt is important that you're in relative folder to your `dir1/`, so all paths returned by `find` are relative to the current folder, so you don't have to [convert absolute paths into relative](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2564634/55075) (this still can be done by `realpath`, e.g. `realpath --relative-to=$absolute $current`, but it will just overcomplicate the above command).\n\nOn macOS, to use `-r` argument for `xargs`, you need to install GNU `xargs` (`brew install xargs`) and use `gxargs` command instead.

The question is whether every $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra arises in\nthis way.\n\n**Question.** Is every $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra the Borel algebra of a\ntopology?\n\nIn other words, does every $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\Sigma$ on a set $X$\ncontain a topology $\\\\tau$ on $X$ such that $\\\\Sigma$ is the $\\\\sigma$\nalgebra generated by the sets in $\\\\tau$?\n\nSome candidate counterexamples were proposed on the math.SE\nquestion, but ultimately shown not to be counterexamples. For\nexample, [my\nanswer there](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/89344/413) shows that the collection of Lebesgue\nmeasurable sets, which seemed at first as though it might be a\ncounterexample, is nevertheless the Borel algebra of the topology\nconsisting of sets of the form $O\\-N$, where $O$ is open in the\nusual topology and $N$ is measure zero. A proposed counterexample\nof Gerald Edgar's there, however, remains unresolved. And I'm not clear on the status of a related proposed counterexample of George Lowther's. \n\nMeanwhile, allow me to propose here a few additional candidate\ncounterexamples:\n\n* Consider the collection $\\\\Sigma\\_0$ of eventually periodic subsets of\n$\\\\omega\\_1$. A set $S\\\\subset\\\\omega\\_1$ is *eventually periodic* if\nabove some countable ordinal $\\\\gamma$, there is a countable length pattern which is simply repeated up to\n$\\\\omega\\_1$ to form $S$. This is a $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra, since it is closed under\ncomplements and countable intersections (one may find a common\nperiod among countably many eventually periodic sets by intersecting the club sets consisting of starting points of the\nrepeated pattern).\n* Consider the collection $\\\\Sigma\\_1$ of eventually\\-agreeing\nsubsets of the disjoint union $\\\\omega\\_1\\\\sqcup\\\\omega\\_1$ of two copies of $\\\\omega\\_1$. That is,\nsets $S\\\\subset \\\\omega\\_1\\\\sqcup\\\\omega\\_1$, such that except for\ncountably many exceptions, $S$ looks the same on the first copy as it does on the\nsecond. Another way to say it is that the symmetric difference of\n$S$ on the first copy with $S$ on the second copy is bounded. This is a $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra, since it is closed under complement and also under countable intersection, as the countably many exceptional sets will union up to a countable set.\n\nPlease enlighten me by showing either that these are not actually\ncounterexamples or that they are, or by giving another\ncounterexample or a proof that there is no counterexample.\n\nIf the answer to the question should prove to be affirmative, but only via strange or unattractive topologies, then consider it to go without saying that we also want to know how good a topology can be found (Hausdorff, compact and so on) to generate the given $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unfortunately, I can only provide a reference but no ideas since I don't have the paper.\nIn \"On the problem of generating sigma\\-algebras by topologies\", Statist. Decisions 2 (1984\\), 377\\-388, Albert Ascherl shows (at least according to the summary to be found on MathSciNet)\nthat there are $\\\\sigma$\\-algebras which can't be generated by a topology.\n\nRobert Lang (same journal 4 (1986\\), 97\\-98\\) claims to give a shorter proof.\n\nAs suggested by Joel, I add the ideas of Lang's example. The underlying space is\n$\\\\Omega\\= 2^{\\\\mathbb R}$, that is the space of all indicator functions, and the $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra is $\\\\mathcal A \\= \\\\bigotimes\\_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\mathcal P$ where $\\\\mathcal P$\nis the power set of the two element set. It is generated by the system $\\\\mathcal E$ of the \"basic open sets\" of the product topology (prescribed values in a finite number of points).\nThis generator has the cardinality $c$ of the continuum and since the generated $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra can be obtained in $\\\\omega\\_1$ (transfinite) induction steps the cardinality\nof $\\\\mathcal A$ is also $c$. On the other hand, if $\\\\mathcal T$ is a topology with $\\\\mathcal A\\=\\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal T)$ then $\\\\mathcal T$ separates points (this should follow from the \"good sets principle\"), in particular, for two distinct points of $\\\\Omega$ the closures of the\ncorresponding singletons are distinct.

Note that in both cases the devices have a moderately small number of functional blocks (3 to 24 or so in the case of the PSoC) with somewhat limited routing options, rather than providing hundreds or thousands of blocks with enough interconnects to allow essentially arbitrary routing.\n\nOne reason that analog FPGA's don't offer anywhere near the design flexibility of digital devices is that even if one passes a digital signal through dozens or hundreds of levels of routing and logic circuitry, each of which has a 10dB signal\\-to\\-noise ratio (SNR), meaning there's 1/3 as much noise as signal, the resulting signal can be clean. By contrast, getting a clean signal from an analog device requires that every stage the signal goes through must be clean. The more complex the routing, the more difficult it is to avoid picking up stray signals.\n\nIn applications that aren't too demanding, having a small amount of analog circuitry combined into a chip can be useful. For example, I've designed a music box which uses a PSoC to drive a piezo speaker directly; the PSoC includes a DAC, a fourth\\-order low\\-pass filter, and output amplifier. It wouldn't have been hard to use a separate chip to do the filtering and amplification, but using the PSoC avoided the need for an extra chip."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the challenges and limitations of analog FPGAs compared to their digital counterparts?\n\nA) Analog FPGAs typically have thousands of functional blocks with arbitrary routing options, similar to digital FPGAs.\n\nB) The signal-to-noise ratio in analog FPGAs improves as the signal passes through more routing and logic circuitry.\n\nC) Analog FPGAs are limited by the need for clean signals at every stage, making complex routing more challenging.\n\nD) Analog FPGAs offer the same level of design flexibility as digital FPGAs, but are less commonly used in industry.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation highlights that analog FPGAs face significant challenges compared to digital FPGAs, primarily due to signal quality concerns. In analog circuits, each stage must maintain a clean signal, which becomes increasingly difficult with complex routing. This is in contrast to digital circuits, where even multiple stages with relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios can still result in a clean output.\n\nOption A is incorrect because analog FPGAs typically have a much smaller number of functional blocks (3 to 24 in the case of PSoC) compared to digital FPGAs, which can have hundreds or thousands.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the signal-to-noise ratio in analog circuits does not improve with more stages; in fact, it typically degrades.\n\nOption D is incorrect because analog FPGAs do not offer the same level of design flexibility as digital FPGAs, due to the limitations in routing and signal quality maintenance."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/11", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/284760", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/164807/"], "docs_id": 284760, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Given a frequency table A of outcomes for a population and a frequence table B of a small sample, could one determine if The sample B could have been randomly drawn from population A?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not easily.

This is so you have a catalog that yum knows about via your .repo file. Your first proposed method would allow you this.\n\nUsing your second method you'd end up having to create repository data for each package you were maintaining, which seems like a nightmare as far as you would have to have repository data for each package.\n\nAdditionally, I wouldn't be building inside of your repository (which is the only reason I can think of for separating it out by software). Set up your build environment with `rpmdev-setuptree`(available in the `rpmdevtools`package), build the rpms and copy/move them from the build structure to your repository structure (`/<root_repo>/<release>/<arch>/<RPMS/SRPMS>`), then generate your repository data via `createrepo` (or `createrepo --update .` ) in the release ( 5\\.4 / 4\\.6 ) directory."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are setting up a local yum repository for custom software packages across multiple server versions.

However, I did not find a satisfactory answer anywhere else (and do not yet have the \"reputation\" to comment or upvote), so I thought it would be best to ask a new question myself.\n\nMy question is this. For each of 12 human subjects, I have computed a correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho) between 6 levels of an independent variable X, and corresponding observations of a dependent variable Y. (Note: the levels of X are not equal across subjects.) My null hypothesis is that in the general population, this correlation is equal to zero. I have tested this hypothesis in two ways:\n\n1. Using a one\\-sample t\\-test on the correlation coefficients obtained from my 12 subjects.\n2. By centering my levels of X and observations of Y such that for each participant, mean(X) \\= 0 and mean(Y) \\= 0, and then computing a correlation over the aggregate data (72 levels of X and 72 observations of Y).\n\nNow, from reading about working with correlation coefficients (here and elsewhere) I have started to doubt whether the first approach is valid. Particularly, I have seen the following equation pop up in several places, presented (apparently) as a t\\-test for average corelation coefficients:\n\n$$t \\= \\\\frac{r}{SE\\_{r}} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n\\-2}}{\\\\sqrt{1\\-r^{2}}}$$\n\nwhere $r$ would be the average correlation coefficient (and let's assume we've obtained this using Fisher's transformation on the per\\-subject coefficients first) and $n$ the number of observations. Intuitively, this seems wrong to me as it does not include any measure of the between\\-subject variability. In other words, if I had 3 correlation coefficients, I would get the same t\\-statistic whether they were \\[0\\.1, 0\\.5, 0\\.9] or \\[0\\.45 0\\.5 0\\.55] or any range of values with the same mean (and $n\\=3$)\n\nI suspect, therefore, that the above equation does not in fact apply when testing the significance of an average of correlation coefficients, but when testing the significance of a single correlation coefficient based on $n$ observations of 2 variables. \n\nCould anyone here please confirm this intuition or explain why it is wrong? Also, if this formula doesn't apply to my case, does anyone know a/the correct approach? Or perhaps my own test number 2 is already valid? Any help is greatly appreciated (including pointers to previous answers that I may have missed or misinterpreted).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A better approach to analysing this data is to use a [mixed\\-model](/questions/tagged/mixed-model \"show questions tagged 'mixed-model'\") (a.k.a. mixed effects model, hierarchical model) with `subject` as a random effect (random intercept or random intercept \\+ slope).

The answers seem targetted to those already familiar with functional programming.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr** summary: they are more powerful, more expressive, and most importantly, they *don't lie*.\n\n\\[Aside: I would like to point out that there is a double false dichotomy in the OP's question.\n\n1. FP and OO are orthogonal, not alternatives. FP is about not having side\\-effects, OO is about behavioral abstraction. You can have behavioral abstraction without side\\-effects, which gives you OO and FP\u00a0\u2013 indeed, William Cook has (only half) jokingly argued that since the only abstraction mechanism in \u03bb\\-calculus is the function, *all* abstraction in \u03bb\\-calculus is automatically behavioral and thus \u03bb\\-calculus is the first and purest OO language. (And indeed, if you see how e.g. booleans are implemented in Smalltalk, the implementation is basically identical to the Church Encoding of booleans in \u03bb\\-calculus, or viewed from the other side, in the Church Encoding of booleans in \u03bb\\-calculus, the values `true` and `false` act at the same time as conditionals \u2026 something that is at the same time a value and behavior smells very much like an object!)\n2. There is nothing that stops a non\\-functional (IOW imperative) language from having a powerful, expressive, strong, strict, static type system. It's just much harder to design one. Type system designers are just as lazy as every other programmer, so FP languages tend to have the better type systems because it is easier to design a better type system for them.\n]\n\nThere is an interesting correspondence between computer programs and logic systems. This was first noticed independently by Curry and Howard, and is now known as the Curry\\-Howard Isomorphism. In a certain mathematical sense, a program written in some programming language is isomorphic to a proof in some formal logic; a type in some programming language is isomorphic to a proposition in some formal logic: *a proof is a program, and the formula it proves is the type for the program*. The return type of a function corresponds to a theorem, the parameter types correspond to the hypotheses, and the function code corresponds to a proof that given the hypotheses, the theorem holds.\n\nSince every type system gives rise to a system of logic (and every system of logic gives rise to a type system), we can look at different type systems by looking at the systems of logic they induce.\n\nBut I won't go deep into mathematical logic and type theory here, not the least because I am neither a logician nor a type theorist. I'll try to stay on the practical side.\n\nIntuitively speaking, you want your type system to induce a system of logic that is *consistent*, i.e. that doesn't allow false theorems to be proven. The more inconsistent the system of logic induced by the type system is, the less useful the type system is as a proof of correctness of the code.\n\nNow, let's look at a couple of (simplified) languages. Let's start with a language like [Idris](http://Idris-Lang.Org/), for example. In Idris, when a function has a return type of `String`, it always returns a `String`. Now, you might say that's obvious, *of course* a function that is typed as `String` returns a `String` \u2026 but does it, really? Is it really that obvious?\n\nLet's look at Java! Here's what a method typed as `String` can return in Java:\n\n* a `String`\n* `null`\n* an exception\n* and it can even not return at all (e.g. run into an infinite loop)\n* in addition to that, it can also return a \"modified state of the world\" (e.g. it can print a line of text to the console)\n\nSo, there are several ways for a method in Java to *not* return a `String` (either not return at all, return nothing, return something else, return something in addition, or several combinations of the above) even when its type says so.\n\nI said above that there is a correspondence between programs and logic, and without going into the mathematical details of what all of this means, you can certainly imagine what happens when you try to prove something using a system of logic that allows you to \"lie\" like that!\n\nA similar thing applies to the parameter types: a method that has a parameter of type `String` can also take `null` as an argument, and in addition to that, it can open a database connection, open a file, open a network connection, read from the console, use a random number generator, use reflection, all to get *additional* inputs, which do not show up in the parameter list.\n\nThis gets even more obvious when we throw *Parametric Polymorphism* (called *Generics* in Java) into the mix. Parametric Polymorphism means that functions know less about their types than when the types are concrete; ironically, this allows us, as the programmer, to know more about what the function does from just the types. A typical example that is often given to demonstrate the power of parametricity, is this mystery function:\n\n```\nmysteryFunc :: (a, b) \u2192 a\n\n```\n\nor in Java syntax:\n\n```\n<A, B> A mysteryFunc(Pair[A, B] p)\n\n```\n\nWhat does this do? What is the name of this function? Now, you might say, how can you know that from just the types, without any documentation, without the name, without the code, but the thing is: you *can*, thanks to parametricity. The function gets passed a pair of values, one of type `a` and one of type `b`. What can the function do? It can't return the second value, it is of the wrong type. It can't get a value of type `a` from somewhere else, because there is no \"somewhere else\"\u00a0\u2013 if it wanted to get an `a` from a database, for example, it would have needed to take a DB handle as an argument. It cannot construct an `a`, because `a` is a type variable: the function doesn't know anything about `a`, and how is it going to construct something it doesn't know what it is?\n\nSo, the only possible thing it *can* do, is return the `a` it was passed\u00a0\u2013 in other words, this is the `fst` function, which returns the first element of the pair it was passed.\n\nThere are other examples, e.g. `a \u2192 a` can *only* be the identity function, there is *no* other function that has this type.\n\nNow, none of this is true in Java. The Java method can go and retrieve an `A` from a database, it can use reflection, it can do lots of other things.\n\nIf we assume not only such a \"logical\" type system, but also a \"logical\" programmer, it gets even more interesting. Let's take the following function type:\n\n```\nBool \u2192 Bool\n\n```\n\nThere are several things this function could do:\n\n1. return the boolean that was passed in\n2. ignore the boolean that was passed in and return a constant\n3. return the result performing some operation on the boolean that was passed in\n\nNow, as you noticed, without parametricity, there is a lot less we can say about the function. However, there are a couple of things we can assume:\n\n1. This is just the identity function for booleans. It doesn't make sense that a programmer would write it that way. Either there is an already existing identity function in the standard library, then she would use that; or there isn't, and she really needs to write it herself, but since the function doesn't actually look at the value at all it doesn't care what type the value has, and it would have the more generic type `a \u2192 a`.\n2. Similar to above: if the function ignored its argument, there wouldn't be a need for the argument to be a boolean, and the type would be `a \u2192 Bool`.\n3. So, this leaves us with option \\#3: the function returns the result of some operation on the value; the only unary operation on booleans is negation, so this is the `not` function.\n\nThis is much less strong than our result for the `fst` function above, since it does not rely solely on the logic of the type system, but also on the \"well\\-behavedness\" of the programmer.\n\nThere are some important things that make all of this work:\n\n* Parametricity\n* Referential Transparency / Purity\n* Totality\n\nJava doesn't have full Parametricity, there are things you can do with values *even if you don't know their types*, for example you can test for reference equality (`==`), you can convert it to a string, you can compute its hash code, you can cast it. Worst: you can get its class, then get that class's constructor, and construct a new one.\n\nJava also doesn't have Referential Transparency / Purity (which essentially means that the value of an expression or the return value of a function depends *only* on its constituent sub\\-expressions or the input arguments to the function; it also means that any function call and any expression can be replaced with its value everywhere in the program (and vice versa) without changing the meaning of the program; intuitively, it means that functions and expressions cannot have side\\-effects). So, not only can Java construct a new `a` using reflection, for example, but it can also print to the console, mutate global state and do pretty much everything it pleases.\n\nThat's why when presented with a signature such as `a \u2192 a`, all we can say is \"this could do literally *anything*, including launching the proverbial nuclear missiles\".\n\nNow, Haskell *does* have Parametricity and Referential Transparency, so in Haskell, we can say a *lot* more, specifically, we can say that *if* this function returns, *then* it is the identity function. IOW, it can either return its argument, or it cannot return at all (e.g. infinitely recurse). There is no other option. These are the only things it can do.\n\nIdris, additionally, is Total, which simply means that functions are defined over all their argument values, i.e. they always return a value. This removes the last alternative, and means that `a \u2192 a` can only be the identity function. (Incidentally, this also means that Idris is not Turing\\-complete, but that is actually not a big deal: Idris *is* \"Tetris\\-complete\", meaning it can do I/O, it can do Foreign Function Calls, it can do interactivity.)\n\n\\[Note: technically speaking, Idris is not Total. You can write non\\-terminating programs in Idris, however, Idris will tell you if it cannot prove that your program will terminate, and then it will no longer guarantee that any other proof it makes is correct.]\n\nSo, this is one piece of the puzzle: the fact that a program type checks tells you a whole lot more about the program than it does in e.g. Java. A function that has type `String` and type checks really *does* return a `String` and doesn't do anything else. This means that you can have a lot more trust in the types, and the types can tell you a whole lot more about the program.\n\nWe can say that, since types are theorems and programs are proof, we can have more confidence that the proof is correct.\n\nThe other piece of the puzzle is that type systems such as Haskell's or Idris's are much more expressive. So, not only can you have more trust in the proofs and the theorems, but the theorems you can write are also more \"interesting\"! I mean the fact that a function that claims to return a `String` *really* does return a `String` is a nice property to have in and of itself, but the *statement* \"Hey, I return a string\" is something you can also write in Java. (You just can't guarantee it's true.)\n\n\\[Note that these are two orthogonal aspects: what I talked about above could be called the \"strength\" or \"strictness\" or \"trustworthiness\" or \"power\" of the type system. It refers to *how strong* the \"claims\" are that I can make about the program, how much I can trust these claims. Whereas the next aspect refers to how \"sophisticated\" the claims can be. We might call this the \"expressiveness\" of the type system.]\n\nHowever, the type systems we are talking about here, can express much more interesting properties. At the extreme end of the scale are *dependently\\-typed languages* which can express *any* property that you can express using formal logic as a type, and then consequently type\\-check it. For example, in a dependently\\-typed language you can express the fact that a function that zips two lists preserves the lengths of the list, you can express the fact that a function that concatenates two lists returns a list whose length is the sum of the lengths of the input lists, you can express the fact that a function that sorts a list returns a list that is, in fact, sorted, has the same length, and the same elements as the input list.\n\nFor example, the Idris standard library has a `Vect` type that is a list that also carries its length **in the type**. Here's the type of the append function:\n\n```\napp : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n + m) a\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, the collection is not only parameterized over its element type (like e.g. a `Vect<A>` in Java), but also over its size, which is a **runtime value**! Imagine a `Vect<A, n>` in Java that is instantiated like `new Vect<String, 3>` \u2026 pretty crazy, huh? Dependently\\-typed languages are called \"dependently\\-typed\" because static types can depend on runtime values\u00a0\u2013 this is the ultimate in expressive power, and essentially blurs (or rather obliterates) the distinction between Automated Theorem Proving and programming: a type can express anything that logic can express, which means everything you would normally write in a formal specification document, you can instead write as a type. And *if* the program compiles, then it is at the same time also a correctness\\-proof of its implementation wrt. the specification.\n\nHowever, not all languages are dependently\\-typed. Most other type systems, such as Haskell's or ML's lie somewhere in between. But still, there are some interesting things that can be done with types. For example, there is a company called Galois in the US that does interesting things with Haskell; among other things they have a document management and document sharing platform for government organizations where they have encoded the rules for distributing classified documents into the Haskell type system. You *literally* cannot write code that accidentally (or even purposefully) leaks classified documents or distributes them to the wrong people: it simply wouldn't compile, it would be a type error.\n\nSo, there you have it:\n\n1. the types are more reliable in that they actually ensure that what they claim is true\n2. the types are more expressive in that you can claim more interesting properties"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of type systems in functional programming languages like Haskell or Idris compared to those in languages like Java?\n\nA) They allow for more efficient compilation and faster runtime performance.\nB) They provide better support for object-oriented programming paradigms.\nC) They offer stronger guarantees about program behavior and allow for more expressive type definitions.\nD) They simplify the syntax of the language, making it easier for beginners to learn.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The type systems in functional programming languages like Haskell or Idris offer two main advantages over those in languages like Java:\n\n1. Stronger guarantees: These type systems are more reliable in ensuring that what they claim is true. For example, a function that claims to return a String will always return a String, without the possibility of returning null, throwing an exception, or having side effects. This is due to properties like referential transparency and totality.\n\n2. More expressive: These type systems allow developers to express more complex properties in the types themselves.

In terms of particle interaction, is there a substantial 'size' difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The temptation is to think of a particle as a little ball whizzing around space, and it therefore makes sense to ask about the size and density of the ball. The trouble is that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a particle is.\n\nOur current best description of particles is using quantum field theory. This describes particles as excitations in quantum fields that pervade all of spacetime. You create a particle by adding energy to the quantum field, and a particle is destroyed by removing energy from the quantum field. Incidentally, this is how particles like the Higgs boson can be created in colliders \\- the energy of motion of the colliding particles is transferred into excitations of quantum fields where it appears as new particles.\n\nAnyhow, these excitations are delocalised and don't have a well defined position and size, so you can't ask *what is a neutrino's size* because the answer is that it doesn't have a size in the usual sense. You can try and confine a particle by interacting with it, and this gives you answers like *there is a 99% probability that the particle is within this cubic femtometre*. But this obviously isn't a *size* as we usually mean the word. A *size* would mean a minimum distance below which we can't confine the particle any further.\n\nTo confine the particle to smaller and smaller distances needs large and large energies. At the biggest energies we can create (in the LHC) fundamental particles like electrons still have no detectable size. Indeed in quantum field theory there is no minimum size \\- by making the energy arbitrarily high we can confine particles to arbitrarily small regions of space. String theory may change this if it turns out to be a useful description, but at present no\\-one knows for for sure if it is.\n\nSo the answer to your question is that it has no answer because particles don't have a size, and therefore don't have a density.

Quantum field theory describes particles as excitations in quantum fields that pervade all of spacetime, rather than as tiny balls with definite sizes and densities. These excitations are delocalized and don't have well-defined positions or sizes in the conventional sense.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because particles in quantum field theory do not have definite sizes or densities that can be measured precisely, even with high-energy colliders.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that neutrinos and photons have conventional sizes and densities, and that these properties are related to their mass. In quantum field theory, neither neutrinos nor photons have well-defined sizes or densities.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because quantum field theory does not define a minimum confinement distance for particles.

It doesn't write your data every time at the same location in the EEPROM, but uses some algorithm to use different locations. I've read about complex wear leveling algorithms, but I wouldn't know why the following simple method wouldn't work. \n\nAdd to your data a 24\\-bit counter, so that your data block is for instance 8 bytes long. Pages on a [24AA64](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21189S.pdf) are 32 bytes long, so a 64kb EEPROM holds 256 pages. From the datasheet: \n\n> \"When doing a write of less than 32 bytes\n>  the data in the rest of the page is refreshed\n>  along with the data bytes being written.\n>  This will force the entire page to endure a\n>  write cycle, for this reason endurance is\n>  specified per page.\"\n\nso it doesn't make sense to use data blocks smaller than a 32 bytes page.\n\nLook at the counter of the first page. If it's zero you used the maximum number of write cycles for that page, so you move on to the next page and check that counter. Repeat until you find a counter \\> zero. That's the page you're currently using. Microchip's EEPROMs have a 1 million cycles endurance, which you can increase to 256 million with the given example of maximum 32 bytes per block in a 64kb EEPROM. That should be enough to outlast your product: 40 years if you write once every 5 seconds(!). \n\nYou'll want to initialize your EEPROM on first use. How do you know when that is. Use the last page to write a unique signature upon initialization. Check at each power\\-up if the signature is there. If it isn't the device has to be initialized. You can preset the counter in each page with 0xF4240 (for 1 million) or clear everything to 0xFF and write the 0xF4240 when you first use the page.  \n\nInitializing an EEPROM is needed because sometimes a certain pattern is written to it in the production/test process. \n\n**edit**  \n\nThe wear leveling should solve your problems, but I still want to comment on the capacitor solution. You say the board is rather power\\-hungry, but maybe you can isolate the microcontroller/EEPROM's power from the rest of the board with a diode. So you'll probably need only a few mA when main power is gone. The 24AA64 writes a page in less than 5ms, then at 10mA and an allowable voltage drop of 100mV you'll need \n\n> \\\\$ C \\= \\\\dfrac{I \\\\cdot t}{\\\\Delta V} \\= \\\\dfrac{10mA \\\\cdot 5ms}{100mV} \\= 500\\\\mu F \\\\$\n\nEasy with a small supercap. \n\n**further reading**  \n\n[datasheet 24AA64](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21189S.pdf)  \n\n[EEPROM Endurance Tutorial](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/01019A.pdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a device that needs to frequently update and store position and temperature data, even after power loss. Which approach would best balance data integrity, component lifespan, and cost-effectiveness?\n\nA) Write data to EEPROM every time it changes, accepting the reduced lifespan of the memory.\n\nB) Use a large capacitor or battery to power the device briefly after main power loss, allowing for a final EEPROM write.\n\nC) Implement a wear leveling technique with a 24-bit counter, distributing writes across different EEPROM pages.\n\nD) Switch to F-RAM memory instead of EEPROM to allow for more frequent writes without wear concerns.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the best solution as it addresses multiple concerns:\n\n1. Data Integrity: By using wear leveling, recent data is always stored, ensuring the device remembers its last state.\n2. Component Lifespan: Distributing writes across different pages significantly extends the EEPROM's lifespan, potentially to 256 million cycles or 40 years with writes every 5 seconds.\n3. Cost-Effectiveness: This solution uses standard EEPROM, which is less expensive than F-RAM (option D).\n4. Practicality: It doesn't require additional components like large capacitors or batteries (option B), saving space and cost.\n5.

If the half\\-life of a nucleus as observed in its rest frame is $\\\\tau(0\\)$, then in some other frame in which it moves at a speed of $v$, it will be:\n\n$$\\\\tau(v) \\=\\\\frac{\\\\tau(0\\)}{\\\\sqrt{1\\-\\\\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$\n\nBecause the typical thermal speeds of atoms at room temperature are much smaller than the speed of light, we may expand the above expression to leading order.

It increases the slope by change the lambda \\< 0, I know we don't do that in shrinkage so my question is can it be beneficial for lambda \\< 0 in some expansion instead of shrinkage?. Are there any case it can be applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To consider this, let's look at what the Lasso estimates of the coefficients is trying to minimize. Suppose $y\\_i$ is the outcome for observation $i\\=1,\\\\ldots,n$ and that $x\\_{ki}$ is the value of covariate $k\\=1,\\\\ldots,p$ for individual $i$. We are interested in estimating the vector of $p$ coefficients, $\\\\beta\\=\\\\beta\\_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\beta\\_p$ is a vector of $p$ coefficients, corresponding to the $p$ covariates they are coefficients for, as well as the intercept $\\\\beta\\_0$. Then the lasso estimate of $\\\\beta$ is \n\n$\\\\hat{\\\\beta}^{lasso} \\= \\\\underset{\\\\beta}{\\\\arg\\\\min}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\underset{i\\=1}{\\\\overset{n}{\\\\sum}}\\\\left( y\\_i \\- \\\\beta\\_0 \\- \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}}\\\\beta\\_k x\\_{ki}\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\lambda \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}} \\\\vert\\\\beta\\_k\\\\vert \\\\right\\\\}$, for some $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0\\.$.\n\nOne reason the lasso is used is due to the fact that highly correlated covariates lead to unstable estimates of their corresponding $\\\\beta$\\-coefficients, when estimated through ordinary least squares (OLS). For instance, if $X\\_1$ and $X\\_2$ are highly correlated, then the OLS estimates of $\\\\beta\\_1$ and $\\\\beta\\_2$ will vary a lot between samples. This leads to an inflated mean squared error in the estimates. Now, in lasso regression, since $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0$, we see that the coefficients are shrunk towards 0 since the penalty term \"punishes\" estimates that are very large. This is, in essence, why lasso can combat some of the problems of multicolinearity.\n\nBut what lappens if we force $\\\\lambda \\< 0$? Well, this is equivalent to continuing to let $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0$ and then minimize:\n\n$\\\\hat{\\\\beta}^{lasso} \\= \\\\underset{\\\\beta}{\\\\arg\\\\min}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\underset{i\\=1}{\\\\overset{n}{\\\\sum}}\\\\left( y\\_i \\- \\\\beta\\_0 \\- \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}}\\\\beta\\_k x\\_{ki}\\\\right)^2 \\- \\\\lambda \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}} \\\\vert\\\\beta\\_k\\\\vert \\\\right\\\\}$, for some $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0\\.$.\n\n(Note the minus before the penalty term, where previously there was a plus.) Now we are instead encouraging the estimated coefficients to be as large as possible. My intuition is that this would be especially true for covariates that are independent of $y\\_i$. So by forcing $\\\\lambda \\< 0$, you would get the estimates of coefficients that are too far away from 0\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Lasso regression, what would be the primary effect of setting \u03bb < 0 (lambda less than zero) in the penalty term?\n\nA) It would shrink all coefficients towards zero, improving model stability.\nB) It would encourage the estimated coefficients to be as large as possible, potentially inflating the impact of irrelevant variables.\nC) It would have no effect on the coefficient estimates compared to ordinary least squares regression.\nD) It would selectively shrink only the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nSetting \u03bb < 0 in Lasso regression would fundamentally change its behavior. Instead of shrinking coefficients towards zero (which is the purpose of the standard Lasso with \u03bb > 0), a negative \u03bb would encourage coefficients to become as large as possible. This is because the penalty term would be subtracted from the objective function rather than added to it.\n\nThe effect would be particularly pronounced for variables that have little or no true relationship with the dependent variable. Their coefficients could be artificially inflated, as making them larger would reduce the overall value of the objective function being minimized.\n\nThis approach would likely lead to severe overfitting and unstable estimates, contradicting the original purpose of Lasso regression, which is to improve model stability and interpretability through coefficient shrinkage.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because:\nA) describes the effect of a positive \u03bb, not a negative one.\nC) is false because negative \u03bb would significantly alter the estimates compared to OLS.\nD) misrepresents the effect, as negative \u03bb would not selectively shrink any coefficients."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/07/20", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/202872", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/78262/"], "docs_id": 202872, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am having an issue with this and think there is a simple solution. \n\nI have a large table, upwards of 500,000 records and need to add new records to it daily.

Mild soapy water will be just fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has recently installed porcelain floor tiles using a single component grout. What is the recommended approach for maintaining the grout and ensuring its longevity?\n\nA) Wait 24 hours after installation, then clean with a strong bleach solution weekly to prevent staining.\n\nB) Apply a good quality sealer immediately after installation, then clean with harsh chemicals to keep the grout looking new.\n\nC) Wait one week after installation, apply a sealer, wait the specified time, clean with a mild detergent like TSP and an abrasive pad, rinse with clean warm water, and reseal after another week.\n\nD) No special care is needed as the single component grout is already stain-resistant and does not require sealing or special cleaning products.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to wait one week after installation, then apply a good quality sealer. After allowing the sealer to set for the time specified in its instructions, clean the floor using a mild detergent like TSP (trisodium phosphate) and an abrasive pad. Rinse with clean warm water and a sponge. Wait another week and apply a second coat of sealer. This method balances protection of the grout with proper cleaning techniques. It avoids harsh chemicals that could damage the grout while still providing thorough cleaning and stain resistance. The other options either risk damaging the grout with harsh chemicals, fail to provide adequate protection, or incorrectly assume no special care is needed."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/03/16", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/246183", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/149652/"], "docs_id": 246183, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My initial thoughts were orange peel, but I'm not entirely sure as it appears different?

It also correctly identifies the colloquial terms used in the UK (anaglypta) and the US (ingrain). Answer A is incorrect as it misidentifies the texture as orange peel.

It keeps the 'copy' tag, which is necessary for some questions (like command line copy issues), but introduces more specific tags to differentiate between different types of copying. This approach helps solve the problem of misuse in Excel-related questions and the ambiguity with the Copy cloud storage software. It also allows for better categorization without completely removing a tag that might be useful in some contexts. Options A and C are too extreme and don't account for all use cases, while option D doesn't solve the underlying issues of ambiguity and misuse."}}
