The documentation states that batteries are consumable with a finite lifetime, and their capacity decreases over time, especially with heavy use. Using high-performance settings that engage the powerful GPU will lead to faster battery consumption, accelerating the rate at which the battery reaches its maximum cycle count (around 1000 full discharge and charge cycles). This behavior is likely to cause the battery's capacity to decrease more rapidly, potentially necessitating a replacement within 3-4 years of heavy use.

It helps to encourage reviewers to \"spend\" their downvotes wisely.\n\nIf that bothers you, you can avoid downvoting \u2014 you can still leave comments explaining what is wrong, etc.\n\nNote also that if the answer is ultimately deleted, you get the rep points back anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the StackExchange documentation, what are the consequences and considerations for downvoting an answer in a review queue?\n\nA) Downvoting in a review queue doesn't affect reputation, but downvoting outside the queue costs -1 reputation.\nB) Downvoting always costs -1 reputation, but the reviewer gains +1 reputation for participating in the review process.\nC) Downvoting costs -1 reputation regardless of how the answer was encountered, and this reputation is only returned if the answer is ultimately deleted.\nD) Reviewers are not allowed to downvote in review queues to maintain objectivity, they can only leave comments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation clearly states that downvoting an answer costs -1 reputation, regardless of whether it was encountered in a review queue or by any other means. This policy is in place to encourage reviewers to use their downvotes judiciously. The documentation also mentions that if the downvoted answer is eventually deleted, the reviewer gets their reputation point back. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the reputation cost applies both in and out of the review queue. Option B is wrong as there's no mention of gaining reputation for participating in reviews. Option D is false because reviewers are allowed to downvote in queues, though they have the alternative of leaving comments without downvoting if they prefer."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/07", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/254579", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/138409/"], "docs_id": 254579, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The max that I was able to get the stats at is 65\\+.

You need to get the great staff and train them and level them up. You can hire 3 special characters as the game progresses and you win game of the year awards and sell millions of copies.

The documentation emphasizes the importance of building and nurturing a great development team over time. It mentions that getting \"great staff and train them and level them up\" is key to achieving high stats. Additionally, the ability to \"hire 3 special characters as the game progresses\" contributes to reaching extremely high stats. The answer also aligns with the advice to be patient, indicating that this is a long-term strategy rather than a quick fix.\n\nOption A is incorrect because restarting the game is not mentioned as a strategy and wouldn't address the core mechanics of staff development.\n\nOption B is partially correct in mentioning Game of the Year awards, but it's overly specific and doesn't account for the broader strategy of team development.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation doesn't mention using in-game currency for immediate stat boosts. The focus is on gradual improvement through team development."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/06", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/412960", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/150109/"], "docs_id": 412960, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I show battery percentage on my Mac's log\\-in screen?\n\nMy menu bar normally shows batter percentage, I have the option enabled in System Preferences, but when I close my laptop lid and reopen it or lock my screen and have to log in again, I can't see the battery's percentage, just the icon.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the release of Big Sur, there appears to be no option to show battery percentage on the login screen.

Boom ! Black screen, fans and keyboards back lights increase activity for a few seconds and then the computer just turns off completely\n\n### Noticeable informations :\n\n* bluetooth can be on or off, it doesn't matter or affect the crash\nbehavior even if sometimes when I turn on the computer after a crash\nbluetooth can be activated or deactivated when it was in the opposite\nstate before the crash,\n* no crashes occur when connected to internet with both wifi and ethernet or just through the ethernet port only. The problem is only when the wifi is on.\n* no crashes when in the mac is started in safe mode and with only wifi on\n* the issue started after updating to sierra os x and prior that date I had very few crashes in years (almost none). Unfortunately my time machine copies before migrating to sierra have been overwritten with post sierra's copies\n\n### I have tried several solutions but the problem remains. Here is a list of the op\u00e9rations I went through so far with absolutely zero success :\n\n* Changing Mac OS X Wireless Card Country Code as explained [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9768/change-mac-os-x-wireless-card-country-code)\n* removing all wifi preferences and all extensions, LaunchAgents, LaunchDeamons, Internet pluggins, etc. (both in /Libbrary/, \\~/Library/, /System/Library, etc.)\n* removing all my applications that could mess up with the system (brew, ports, cleaner, magicPrefs, Citrix, antivirus, etc.) and cleaned all their remaining files (such as .plist files, etc.)\n* updating to os x sierra with the utilities of the recovery mode\n* bootable usb key, hard drive format, os x sierra clean installation and personal data recovery with time machine\n* and of course I have tried contacting the apple support (feedback/bug report messages, phone calls and several visits to the so called genius bar where all hardware tests showed nothing wrong (their conclusion : as it works fine in safe mode, it might be a software issue but they don't know where and why turning wifi on is triggering the crashes). My conviction : it is a faulty sierra wifi card driver responsible of the crashes as I always get com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360\\.0 crash logs after each single unwanted shutdown and few times accompanied with a com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family crash log (CCIOReporter log file).\n\nI think all is said about my issue. And I will also provide a crash report (pretty messy) or an etreCheck reports (clearer) but both didn't give usable information. I hope my approach can help some of you solving similar issues and also that some can help me find a solution.\n\n---\n\n*EtrePort report extract :*\n\n```\n\nLes informations mat\u00e9rielles : \u24d8  \n\n    MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 pouces, fin 2013)   \n\n    [Les caract\u00e9ristiques techniques] - [Le guide de l\u2019utilisateur] - [Garantie & service]  \n\n    MacBook Pro - mod\u00e8le : MacBookPro11,2  \n\n    1 2 GHz Intel Core i7 (i7-4750HQ) CPU: 4-core  \n\n    8 GB RAM Pas extensible  \n\n        BANK 0/DIMM0  \n\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok  \n\n        BANK 1/DIMM0  \n\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok  \n\n    Bluetooth: Bon - Handoff/Airdrop2 disponible  \n\n    Wireless:  en0: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac  \n\n    La batterie : Sant\u00e9 = Satisfaisant - Comptage de cycles = 426  \n\nLes informations vid\u00e9o : \u24d8  \n\n    Intel Iris Pro  \n\n        Color LCD 2880 x 1800  \n\nLes logiciel du syst\u00e8me : \u24d8  \n\n    macOS Sierra  10.12.3 (16D32) - Temps depuis le d\u00e9marrage : environ 2 heures  \n\nLes informations des disques : \u24d8  \n\n    APPLE SSD SM0256F disk0 : (251 GB) (Solid State - TRIM: Yes)  \n\n    [Afficher le rapport SMART]  \n\n        EFI (disk0s1)   : 210 Mo   \n\n        Recovery HD (disk0s3)   [Restauration] : 650 Mo   \n\n        Macintosh HD (disk1) /  [Startup] : 249.78 Go (50.76 Go libre)  \n\n            Crypt\u00e9 AES-XTS Ouvert  \n\n            Core Storage: disk0s2 250.14 Go Online  \n\nLes informations USB : \u24d8  \n\n    Apple Inc.

This suggests that the issue may be related to power management or battery status affecting the WiFi hardware.

Let me illustrate what I mean with a graphical example:\n\nInput\n-----\n\nSuppose I have the following MultiLineString: `MULTILINESTRING ((120 105, 140 98),(160 103, 140 98),(100 100, 120 105))`\n[![Input MultiLineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)\n\nNote how, to our human eyes, it seems out of order: the first (orange) segment is in the middle, the second (green) segment is coded backwards in relation to the other segments (i.e., pointing to the left instead of to the right).\n\nDesired Output\n--------------\n\nThe desired output would be the following LineString: `LINESTRING (100 100, 120 105, 140 98 160 103)`\n\n[![Output LineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)\n\nNote how the output is now looks much more sensible. It's one continuous `LineString`, the segments are all nicely ordered from left to right and the green segment itself is now oriented from left to right.\n\nIs there a simple way to perform this kind of \"reordering\" inside `MultiLineString`s?\n\nWhat I've done so far\n---------------------\n\nI'm trying to develop a solution using Python's `Shapely` library. My approach has two different steps:\n\n* Extract unique coordinates\n* Sort unique coordinates\n\nI've been able to do the first part quite easily, but it's not clear to me how to reorder the points.\n\nI thought about a heuristic that would find the point that is cumulatively furthest to all other points, label that as the starting point, add all other points to a pool of unsorted points and then sequentially find the next closest point until I run out of unsorted points.\n\nHowever, this sorting heuristic would fail in A BUNCH of cases: consider a geometry that describes a spiral.

If you have 4G total RAM, you can create a slightly smaller swap partition than the 8G partition that you have before. Make it 4G.\n3. select the newly created swap partition and right\\-click on it and select the swapon command. This will temporarily enable swap.\n4. in terminal, type `sudo blkid` and note the UUID for the newly created swap partition (it may, or may not, be sda9\\).\n5. in terminal, `sudo gedit -H /etc/fstab` and find the commented out line \n\n```\n#UUID=2238a8ba-5029-47d6-8276-472f1bea530e none swap sw 0 0\n\n```\n\nremove the \\#, and change the UUIID to the one that you got from the `blkid` command.

What happens to those questions that were on SO if the PM site dies?\n* The migrated questions may affect the organic growth and direction of the new site. Early questions on a beta determine the site's topic and direction for a long time.\n* Questions may not be tagged correctly, as ChrisF pointed out. Each question must be weighted individually.\n\nAdditionally, there is not enough traffic on the PMSE site because it's still new. However, the growth is looking good. The number of referring sites is increasing, which means that the site will eventually be easier to find in search engines. \n\nIt takes time to build a good site, so the best approach is to let the site grow on it's own, and once it's purpose is more established by the community, then we can decide if we really want to migrate any questions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason given for not migrating questions from established Stack Exchange sites to beta sites?\n\nA) Beta sites have too few followers to handle migrated questions\nB) Migrated questions may affect the organic growth and direction of the new site\nC) Beta sites lack experienced moderators to manage migrated content\nD) Migrating questions reduces traffic on the original site\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that \"The migrated questions may affect the organic growth and direction of the new site.

Is it a universal system, or does every language have their own \"version\" of it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a universal (more or less) system for recording human speech sounds.  \n\nIt's called the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/), or IPA. \u00a0 (Note: That's *Phonetic*, **not** *Phonemic*.)  \n\nThis contains all the sounds that occur in any human language.  \n\nNaturally, no human language has all of them.  \n\nNo human language even has most of them.\n\nIndividual languages use only some of those sounds, and representations of words in individual languages use a special selection of these symbols \\-\\- different for every language \\-\\- called \"phonemes\". Usually the symbols used are taken from the IPA, but they represent only the sounds and their distribution and pronunciation **in that language**.\n\nFor instance, [this is the American English phonemic system](http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/modestproposal.pdf), from [Kenyon and Knott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_and_Knott).\n\nEnglish dictionaries published in the United States normally don't use phonemic pronunciation, preferring the system invented by Noah Webster, based on spelling instead of phonetics. Webster was a spelling reformer, and believed that the traditional English spelling could be used to indicate phonetics. He was wrong, but that hasn't influenced American dictionaries.\n\nEnglish dictionaries published elsewhere, or bilingual dictionaries, or dictionaries intended for language learners, normally do use standard phonemic transcription. If you have a bilingual dictionary, look at the pronunciations in the English part; they will normally use either the system of Kenyon and Knott (American) or a system of [RP (UK)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_pronunciation), which has some differences from American. This is because English speakers normally pay no attention to the pronunciations in the English part, but English learners do, and they need accuracy.\n\nThe example cited\n\n> `\\p\u022frt-\u02c8man-(\u02cc)t\u014d\\`\n\nis the style used by Merriam\\-Webster, based on the original nonphonemic transcription.  \n\nIn Kenyon and Knott's system, it would be\n\n> `/portm\u00e6nto/`\n\nand in RP it would be\n\n> `/po\u0259tm\u00e6nt\u0259\u028a/`\n\nRegardless of what the Wikipedia entry above says, the M\\-W system is **not** phonemic."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about phonetic representation systems is most accurate?\n\nA) The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a language-specific system used only for English pronunciation.\n\nB) Merriam-Webster dictionaries use a phonemic transcription system based on the IPA.\n\nC) The pronunciation guide used in American dictionaries is typically based on Noah Webster's spelling-based system rather than phonetic accuracy.\n\nD) All English dictionaries worldwide use the same standardized phonetic representation system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the IPA is a universal system for recording human speech sounds across all languages, not just English.\n\nB is incorrect because Merriam-Webster dictionaries use a non-phonemic transcription style based on Noah Webster's system, not the IPA or a strictly phonemic system.\n\nC is correct. The passage states that \"English dictionaries published in the United States normally don't use phonemic pronunciation, preferring the system invented by Noah Webster, based on spelling instead of phonetics.\"\n\nD is incorrect because the passage indicates that different English dictionaries use different systems.

In order to add a column to the grid you would need to add a field to this table and update the information in that field when an order is created/updated.

Both give an external definition of the situation $A\\\\subset\\_{subring}B$. All depends on the context. \n\nA) The first one (the most spread and your case) is that $B$ is a $A$\\-module with commutation of the multiplications i.e. for all $a\\\\in A$ and $b\\_i\\\\in B$, one has the identities (associativity w.r.t. to scaling) \n$$\na(b\\_1b\\_2\\))\\=(ab\\_1\\)b\\_2\\=b\\_1(ab\\_2\\)\n$$\n\nHere, \"finitely generated as a $A$ algebra\" means that there exists a finite set $F\\\\subset B$ such that the smallest $B\\_1$ for which  \n\n$$\nA\\\\cup F\\\\subset\\_{subring}B\\_1\\\\subset\\_{subring}B\n$$\nis precisely $B$. \n\nFrom this, you see that **$B$ is finitely generated as a $A$\\-module (FGM)** means that it exists $F\\=\\\\{f\\_1,f\\_2,\\\\cdots f\\_n\\\\}\\\\subset B$, such that for all $b\\\\in B$ we have a decomposition \n$$\nb\\=\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n a\\_if\\_i\n$$\nwith $a\\_i\\\\in A$.\n\nAnd **$B$ is finitely generated as a $A$\\-algebra (FGA)** means that it exists \n$F\\=\\\\{f\\_1,f\\_2,\\\\cdots f\\_n\\\\}\\\\subset B$, such that for all $b\\\\in B$ we have a decomposition \n$$\nb\\=\\\\sum\\_{\\\\alpha\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^F} a\\_\\\\alpha F^\\\\alpha\n$$\nwhere $\\\\alpha$ is a (weight) mapping $F\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$ i.e. \n$\\\\alpha(f\\_i)\\=\\\\alpha\\_i$ and $F^\\\\alpha\\=f\\_1^{\\\\alpha\\_1}\\\\cdots f\\_n^{\\\\alpha\\_n}$ (multiindex notation) and $a\\_\\\\alpha\\\\in A$. \n\nSo (FGM) implies (FGA). \n\nFor the converse, you need to extend $F$ with the products of powers of the $f\\_i$, but remaining finite. There the condition that $B$ is integral has to be used. In view of \\[1], for all $i\\\\in I$, one can write \n$$\nf\\_i^{d\\_i}\\=\\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^{d\\_i\\-1}a\\_k\\\\,f\\_i^k\n$$\nthis proves that every $F^\\\\alpha$ can be written as a $A$\\-linear combination of the $F^\\\\beta$ with $\\\\beta\\_i\\< d\\_i$ for all $i$. But those $F^\\\\beta$ are in finite number. So $B$ is (FGM). \n\nB) In the second one, we have $B$ is a $A$\\-bimodule and one has, still for all $a\\\\in A$ and for all $b\\_i\\\\in B$ (associativity w.r.t. scalings) \n$$\na(b\\_1b\\_2\\)\\=(ab\\_1\\)b\\_2\\\\ ;\\\\ b\\_1(ab\\_2\\)\\=(b\\_1a)b\\_2\\\\ ;\\\\ (b\\_1b\\_2\\)a\\=b\\_1(b\\_2a)\n$$\n\\[1] wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_element>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a ring A and its extension B, where B is integral over A.

This allows us to express any power of f\u1d62 as an A-linear combination of lower powers, bounded by the degree of its minimal polynomial. Consequently, any element of B can be expressed as an A-linear combination of products of the generators with bounded exponents, which forms a finite set. Thus, B is also FGM.\n\nThis equivalence holds specifically when B is integral over A, which is a crucial condition for the implication from FGA to FGM."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/246336", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/98745/"], "docs_id": 246336, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to create a template using the \"Print Composer\" from my layers loaded in QGIS 2\\.18\\.7 (Las Palmas).

In otherwords, whenever you pan or zoom in/out of the canvas, the composer map will also update. You can type the following code into the **Python Console**:\n\n```\ndef update_composer():\n    active_Composer = iface.activeComposers()\n    canvas = iface.mapCanvas()\n    composer = active_Composer[0]\n    composition = composer.composition()\n    maps = [item for item in composition.items() if item.type() == QgsComposerItem.ComposerMap and item.scene()]\n    composer_map = maps[0]\n    moveX = composer_map.extent().center().x()-canvas.extent().center().x()\n    moveY = composer_map.extent().center().y()-canvas.extent().center().y()\n    unitCon = composer_map.mapUnitsToMM()\n    composer_map.moveContent(-moveX * unitCon, moveY * unitCon)\n    composer_map.setNewScale(canvas.scale())\n\niface.mapCanvas().extentsChanged.connect(update_composer)\n\n```\n\n---\n\n*Credit to the author Ed B for his plugin: [Sync Composer With Map](https://github.com/boesiii/synccomposerwithmap) of which this code was based upon (you can download/install this plugin from the menubar:* `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...`)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In QGIS 2.18.7, a user wants to automatically update the map template in Print Composer when changes are made to the main map canvas.

The key to understanding this is the filtration of H*(\u2102P^n) by the subspaces F_p = span{y^m | \u03b1(m) \u2264 p}, where \u03b1(m) is the sum of digits in the binary expansion of m. These subspaces are preserved by all Steenrod operations.\n\nFor any k, y^(2^(j-1)-k) \u2208 H^(2^j-2k)(\u2102P^n) is in F_p where p = \u03b1(2^(j-1)-k). However, y^(2^(r-1)-k) \u2208 H^(2^r-2k)(\u2102P^n) is not in F_p because \u03b1(2^(r-1)-k) > \u03b1(2^(j-1)-k) = p. \n\nSince Sq^I preserves F_p, Sq^I(y^(2^(j-1)-k)) must be in F_p, which means it cannot equal y^(2^(r-1)-k). Therefore, Sq^I(y^(2^(j-1)-k)) must be zero.\n\nThis argument holds for all k, so Sq^I : H^(2^j-2k)(\u2102P^n) \u2192 H^(2^r-2k)(\u2102P^n) is always the zero map, regardless of the specific form of the Steenrod operation Sq^I."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/17", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/80806", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/21722/"], "docs_id": 80806, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking to host an autocomplete service.

It creates a mutual exchange of gratitude where the customer acknowledges the employee's service, mirroring the employee's thanks for the customer's business. This response shows an understanding of the reciprocal nature of the transaction and is commonly used in fast-food settings.\n\nOption A (\"You're welcome\") and B (\"Don't mention it\"), though not incorrect, may feel slightly out of place in this quick transactional scenario. They imply that the customer has done a favor for the employee, which isn't quite accurate in this context.\n\nOption D is incorrect because some form of response is generally expected and appreciated in social interactions, especially in service settings.\n\nThe correct response (\"Thank you\") maintains a professional yet friendly tone, acknowledges the service provided, and keeps the interaction brief and appropriate for a fast-food environment."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/11", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/320634", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/28104/"], "docs_id": 320634, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Question:** Where can one find information on which areas of mathematics\nare represented at which of the [more than 20 universities](https://www.4icu.org/kp/) in the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and on which mathematicians\nare working there?\n\nThe DPRK is a country with a population of about 25 million people,\nand it is industrialised to a degree which has permitted it to successfully\nconstruct nuclear weapons and ICBM's.

This is because circularly polarized light has equal intensity in all planes of polarization. When passed through a polarizing beam splitter, it will produce two beams of equal and constant intensity, regardless of the orientation of the splitter.

How can we find out the path followed by the system using the least\\-action principle (Hamilton's Principle)? As it seems to me that it can only be used when both end points are known.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a subtle point. In principle, $q(t\\_2\\)$ (as well as $q(t\\_1\\)$) is indeed held fixed at its unknown final value. However, in practice, to a apply Hamilton's principle you don't actually directly fix those path endpoints and calculate any actions, as you might expect you would.\n\nIn practice (for classical systems \\- things are different in quantum mechanics), you always solve the general problem first, by ignoring your initial condition and requiring that the action be stationary for *arbitrary* fixed initial and final positions. (By \"arbitrary fixed\", which may sound contradictory, I mean that you are requiring the action to be stationary over the space of trajectories with fixed endpoints, but you're separately solving the problem for all possible choices of fixed endpoints, rather than just solving it for a single specific choice of endpoints.)\n\nThis gives you the Euler\\-Lagrange equation, when turns out to be *independent* of those endpoints. Then you forget about the action entirely and just work directly with the Euler\\-Lagrange equation, which is a differential equation that can be tackled as an initial\\-value problem. In practice, this second step ends up being completely independent from the initial step of varying the action \\- the action formalism gets you the E\\-L equation, but then you can forget about it and jump directly to the E\\-L equation.\n\nSo it's this weird conceptual two\\-step, where you hold the trajectory endpoint fixed to an *unknown* variable (literally just the dummy variable \"$q(t\\_2\\)$\", with no fixed value assigned). Since the value of $q(t\\_2\\)$ ends up not entering into the differential equation that pops out, you don't actually need to know it ahead of time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In applying Hamilton's principle of least action to determine the path of a system when only the initial coordinates are known, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) We must know both the initial and final coordinates to apply Hamilton's principle effectively.\n\nB) We solve for the general case first, deriving the Euler-Lagrange equation without specifying endpoints, then use it as an initial-value problem.\n\nC) We directly calculate the action for various possible paths and choose the one with the least action.\n\nD) We must use a different principle entirely, as Hamilton's principle is not applicable when the final coordinates are unknown.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach, as described in the documentation, is to solve the general problem first by requiring the action to be stationary for arbitrary fixed initial and final positions. This leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is independent of the specific endpoints. Once we have this equation, we can treat it as an initial-value problem, using only the known initial coordinates to solve for the system's path. This two-step process allows us to apply Hamilton's principle even when we don't know the final coordinates in advance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because we don't actually need to know both endpoints to apply the principle.

As I understand it, you have a capacitor, resistor, and LED all in series, and you want to know how things decay if the capacitor starts out initially charged up.\n\nAt first apporoximation, you can consider the LED a voltage source. That means the current will decay just as if the LED wasn't there and the cap was charged up to the LED voltage less than what it really was. This is now a simple R\\-C systems which follows a basic exponential decay with a time constant of RC, which it seems you already understand. The question of when the LED goes \"off\" then comes down to at what current you consider the brightness to be low enough to be off. This can vary a lot by the efficiency of the LED, ambient light level, and how obvious \"on\" is supposed to be. For example, if the cap is initially charged so that the initial current is 20 mA (a common maximum for LEDs) and you consider 1 mA the \"off\" level, then the on time will be the 95% decay time, which is 3\\.0 time constants.\n\nAs I said, this was the basic first approximation where the LED has a fixed voltage accross it. That will be largely true, but of course its voltage will drop with current somewhat. For practicle purposes, this is a small effect compared to the slop of deciding what current level \"off\" really is, unless that current is small, like less than a mA."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A circuit consists of a capacitor (C = 100 \u03bcF), resistor (R = 1 k\u03a9), and LED (threshold voltage Us = 2V) connected in series.

For example, if A = {x \u2208 \u211a : x > 0}, then B is empty.\n\nStatement IV is true: As shown in the counterexample for Statement II, A = \u211a - \u2124 is bounded below by 0 but unbounded above, and B is empty.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and IV are correct, making C the correct answer."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/09/05", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/585519", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/207355/"], "docs_id": 585519, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently reading the textbook *Fundamentals of Power Electronics*, third edition, by Robert W. Maksimovic and Dragan Erickson. In the introduction, the authors say the following:\n\n> High efficiency is essential in any power processing application. The primary reason for this is usually not the desire to save money on one\u2019s electric bills, nor to conserve energy, in spite of the nobility of such pursuits. Rather, high efficiency converters are necessary because construction of low\\-efficiency converters, producing substantial output power, is impractical. The efficiency of a converter having output power \\\\$P\\_{out}\\\\$ and input power \\\\$P\\_{in}\\\\$ is\n> $$\\\\eta \\= \\\\dfrac{P\\_{out}}{P\\_{in}} \\\\tag{1\\.1}$$\n> The power lost in the converter \\\\$P\\_{loss} \\= P\\_{in} \\- P\\_{out}\\\\$ can be related to the output power as\n> $$Q \\= \\\\dfrac{P\\_{out}}{P\\_{loss}} \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\eta}{1 \\- \\\\eta} \\\\tag{1\\.2}$$\n> Equation (1\\.2\\) is plotted in Fig. 1\\.3\\. The quantity \\\\$Q \\= P\\_{out}/P\\_{loss}\\\\$ is a fundamental measure of the quality of the power converter. The loss \\\\$P\\_{loss}\\\\$ is converted into heat by the converter circuit elements and must be removed by a cooling system.\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pntzw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pntzw.png)\n\nThere are a couple of things here that confuse me. First of all, the authors say that equation (1\\.2\\) is plotted in Fig. 1\\.3, but Fig. 1\\.3 shows \\\\$\\\\eta\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\dfrac{P\\_{loss}}{P\\_{out}}\\\\$, rather than \\\\$\\\\dfrac{\\\\eta}{1 \\- \\\\eta}\\\\$ and \\\\$P\\_{out}/P\\_{loss}\\\\$. Furthermore, it isn't clear to me how one gets \\\\$Q \\= \\\\dfrac{P\\_{out}}{P\\_{loss}} \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\eta}{1 \\- \\\\eta}\\\\$ from \\\\$\\\\eta \\= \\\\dfrac{P\\_{out}}{P\\_{in}}\\\\$ and \\\\$P\\_{loss} \\= P\\_{in} \\- P\\_{out}\\\\$. Is there an error here, or am I just misunderstanding these two facts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relationships shown by the authors can be found by simple manipulations as illustrated below:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ikVJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ikVJ.png)\n\nAs you rightfully pointed out, you need to plot 1/Q to obtain the curve they display and I agree that it can be misleading at first sight but all is correct. The important point here is that efficient converters require less heatsinking and means to evacuate the power lost in heat leading towards compact and light power supplies in the end."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A power converter has an input power of 1000 W and an output power of 950 W.
