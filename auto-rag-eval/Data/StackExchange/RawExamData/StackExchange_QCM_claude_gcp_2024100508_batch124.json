I know that I will want to replace it once a year (I am weird like that), so I thought I'd get a few of these:\n\n[Corduct 15 ft Cord Protector](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100164060/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053)\n\nThe idea is that I could keep the wire as short as possible. It should be easy to replace the wire, too. My idea is to take some very long string, tie something metalic to it that will fit through the channel in the cord protector, then take a magnet to the metal object and drag the string through to the other side. I would then tie my speaker wire to the end of the string and pull it through.\n\nDoes this sound like a workable approach? The above\\-linked cord protector looks reasonably thin, so I don't think it'd be too noticeable if stepped on through the new thick padding and thick carpet I will soon be getting.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You'll end up with two lumps in the carpet that can't be easily removed. You'll also have holes in your carpet at each side for the wire. So unless you're going for the college dorm look, I'd recommend against this. If you do it anyway, the only way to get the wire through this is to attach it to the existing wire and use that to pull it through. I doubt the magnet idea would ever work, and trying to push the wire through would just fold on itself since it's not rigid enough.\n\nAs for the way I would do it, the easy way is to pick up a box of [nail clips](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202698897/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) and tack the wire down around the baseboard. With these, you can pull the nail slightly and spin the clip 180 degrees to easily add or remove a wire behind it. After enough time and especially enough furniture, you tend to forget they are even there. You can also have a nicer look with some [wall mounted conduit](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202562905/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053).\n\nThe excessive option is to open up the floor or below ceiling and run [flexible conduit](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202316470/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053&superSkuId=202891061) through the floor, preferably with the ends in the wall behind [a modular plate](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100356860/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) with the appropriate [connectors](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100356844/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) installed.

The proof for the general case (f(a) = f(b) = k, where k is any real number) can be derived from the special case (f(a) = f(b) = 0) by applying a vertical shift to the function.

The ratio of baryonic to dark matter is not solely determined by galactic dynamics, but also by Big Bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements. The element abundance from Big Bang nucleosynthesis is considered a more important indicator of the baryonic to dark matter fraction. Large-scale measurements of cluster dynamics are used to determine the total matter fraction relative to dark energy, so this discovery would likely have minimal impact on that ratio.

If you do this I would always add a very large fudge factor. Unless the job is simple and you have done something almost exactly like it before you should estimate at least 3x what you think it should take, at first, if the deadline *must* be met. Maybe more. As you gain experience you might find that you can drop that a bit but the fudge factor should always be there. If you do this you will have to be quite rigid about not accepting changes without extending the deadline.\n\nAnother option is to be very honest with your client. The truth is that software estimates are very difficult to make accurately. So you can simply say \"I believe it will be X days before this is done. But I could be wrong. It might take significantly longer than that. And if you want changes as the work goes on it will make the whole thing take longer.\" Then you can work with them in terms of schedule. Even then you should apply a fudge factor but it can be smaller, since you have not absolutely promised to finish by a certain date.\n\nI'd also say that having your internet down/computer problems/etc. is not a very good excuse in most cases. You are a professional, so you are responsible for making sure you have internet access, and making sure you have a backup plan (I've done client work on a laptop at an internet cafe before, and I remember once seeing a developer pay someone $200\\.00 USD to use their internet connection overnight in order to respond to a client emergency when they were too far from home to get back in a timely enough manner.)\n\nI've done some very rush jobs, with hard deadlines in the past. I always charged a lot for it because it often meant days with little to no sleep. That can be lucrative, but it's not something I want to do very much, so when I freelance I tend to be generous with my time estimates, and leave myself some leeway. If I lose a job I lose a job\\- that is better than failing to keep an impossible promise."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a freelance programmer working from home, which of the following approaches is most likely to lead to successful project completion and maintain good client relationships?\n\nA) Always accept hard deadlines without any buffer, and explain any delays as they occur due to unforeseen circumstances like internet outages or research time.\n\nB) Provide extremely optimistic time estimates to win more contracts, then negotiate for extensions as needed during the project.\n\nC) Give time estimates with a large buffer (e.g., 3x the expected time), accept hard deadlines, and rigidly refuse any changes without deadline extensions.\n\nD) Provide honest estimates with a reasonable buffer, clearly communicate the potential for delays or changes affecting the timeline, and have backup plans for technical issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most professional and effective approach. It combines honesty with clients, realistic planning, and preparedness. This method:\n1. Sets reasonable expectations with clients from the start.\n2. Allows for some flexibility in the timeline without overpromising.\n3. Demonstrates professionalism by having contingency plans for technical issues.\n4. Keeps communication open, which is crucial for maintaining good client relationships.\n\nOption A is problematic because it doesn't account for potential issues and can lead to consistently missed deadlines. Option B is unethical and likely to damage client trust. Option C, while better than A or B, is too rigid and doesn't allow for the natural evolution of projects or client needs.

This follows from proofs in \\[Milnor, John, Two complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct.\nAnn. of Math. (2\\) 74 1961 575\\-\\-590].\n2. Tangent bundle to any exotic $n$\\-sphere is diffeomorphic to $TS^n$ as proved in \\[De Sapio, Rodolfo, Disc and sphere bundles over homotopy spheres, Math. Z. 107 1968 232\\-\\-236].\n3. In dimensions $n\\\\ge 5$ one can attack this question via surgery theory. For example, let $f:N\\\\to M$ be a homotopy equivalence of closed $n$\\-manifolds that has trivial normal invariant (which is a bit more than requiring that $f$ preserves stable tangent bundle). Multiply $f$ by the identity map of $(D^n, S^{n\\-1})$, where $D^n$ is the closed $n$\\-disk. Then Wall's $\\\\pi\\-\\\\pi$ theorem implies that $M\\\\times D^n$ and $N\\\\times D^n$ are diffeomorphic, so if tangent bundles of $M, N$ are trivial, this gives manifolds with diffeomorphic tangent bundles.\n4. To illustrate the method in 3, here is a particular example of **infinitely many** non\\-homeomorphic closed manifolds with diffeomorphic tangent bundles. Fix any closed $(4r\\-1\\)$\\-manifold $M$ where $r\\\\ge 2$ such that $TM$ is stably trivial and $\\\\pi\\_1(M)$ has (nontrivial) elements of finite order. Then results of Chang\\-Weinberger imply that there are infinitely many closed $n$\\-manifolds $M\\_i$ that are simply\\-homotopy equivalent to $M$ and such that the tangent bundles $TM\\_i$ are all diffeomorphic (I am not quite sure how to get them be diffeomorphic to $M\\\\times\\\\mathbb R^n$ even though this should be possible).

I usually use the coin or the shield, because i feel like it's the most secure gold income. However one day I played lulu support with the spellthiefs edge and by playing really aggressive I procced the passive quite often. I think I got more gold on this Item than on any other game where I lasthitted with the shield or stood near a minion when it died. I personally feel like on average i'm getting the most gold with the shield, but mathematically i'm not sure about that.\n\nLet's say there are 6 bot lanes in 3 different games with 3 different Items.

I'm not taking in account any gold increases from masteries.\n2. I'm taking the first ten minutes of the game as 'laning phase', The\nvalues may change if the laning phase is longer, but you really\ncan't know that up front so early decision making should not change.\n3. I'm not taking into account any jungle farming\n4. I'm assuming the 'level 1' version of the items, buying the upgrade\nat some point will ofcourse change the data\n\nRelic shield:\n-------------\n\nMinions start spawning from 1:30\\. So at ten minutes the 18th wave will spawn. This means that for the first ten minutes you have 17 waves to farm (the 18th will be underway at ten minutes). A cannon minion spawns in the wave every 3 waves and the Relic shield has a 60 second internal cooldown. So you can last hit the following:  \n\nwave 1 (melee minion) \\+23 \\+5  \n\nwave 3 (cannon minion) \\+40 \\+5  \n\nwave 5 (melee minion) \\+23 \\+5  \n\nwave 7 (cannon minion) \\+40 \\+5  \n\nwave 9 (melee minion) \\+23 \\+5  \n\nwave 11 (cannon minion) \\+40 \\+5  \n\nwave 13 (melee minion) \\+23 \\+5  \n\nwave 15 (cannon minion) \\+40 \\+5  \n\nwave 17 (melee minion) \\+23 \\+5 \n\n**total 320 gold**\n\nSpellthief's edge:\n------------------\n\nThe internal cooldown is 10 seconds **per enemy**. In a standard game you will be able to start hitting your opponents from about 2:00 when both teams go to their lane after helping their jungler. That means you can hit your opponents 48 times (both of them, as the cooldown is not shared between enemies hit) so 96 procs on the item. It gives you 4 gold per proc. Spellthief's edge also gives a passive 2 gold per 10 seconds. This is 120 gold for ten minutes.\n\n**total 504 gold**\n\nAncient coin:\n-------------\n\nThis one is easy, there are 17 waves (as said in the Relic shield part) to be farmed. Four of them have an extra minion. totaling 106 minions. The coin gives 2 gold. It also has the 2 gold per 10 seconds passive.\n\n**total 332 gold**\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\n\nSpellthief's edge is the best item for pure gold gain, but it only grants gold to you. The Relic shield also gives gold to your adc (85\\). Ancient coin seems like the worst choice gold wise, but it's a lot more passive (and easy, 'safe pick' etc). Depending on when you buy the upgrades this coud change a lot. I think it's too complex to go into that in an answer here, if you really want to know about the upgrades as well, I suggest looking up a support guide that covers these items. \n\nsources:  \n\n[Relic shield wiki entry](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Relic_Shield)  \n\n[Spellthief's edge wiki entry](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Spellthief's_Edge)  \n\n[Ancient coin wiki entry](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Nomad%27s_Medallion)  \n\n[Minions wiki entry](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=654411)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A support player wants to maximize their gold income during the first 10 minutes of laning phase using one of the three support items.

Still, I can't find a tutorial how this fits together.\n\nFirst, to make automatic core updates with FS\\_method \"direct\" work, mostly all of WordPress has to be owned by www\\-data, i.e.:\n\n```\nchown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/wordpress\n\n```\n\nFurthermore, I have a local account \"sftp\\-wordpress\" which I put into the group \"www\\-data\".\n\nI made wp\\-content and everything inside group\\-writable (group is www\\-data, see above), so sftp\\-wordpress is able to write, and \\- to be on the safe side\\- I made \"wp\\-content\" and its subdirectories setgid:\n\n```\nchmod -R g+w /var/www/wordpress/wp-content\nfind /var/www/wordpress/wp-content -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \\;\n\n```\n\n**First problem:** To setup the chroot, I put the following in /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config:\n\n```\nMatch User sftp_wordpress\n    ChrootDirectory /var/www/wordpress/wp-content\n    ForceCommand internal-sftp -u 0002\n    AllowTcpForwarding no\n\n```\n\nThis won't work, since OpenSSH doesn't like the permissions and the owner of the ChrootDirectory:\n\n```\nfatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory \"/var/www/wordpress/wp-content\"\n\n```\n\nSo I took out the chroot requirement for now, by disabling the ChrootDirectory directive.\n\nAt this point, I'm able to upload files into wp\\-content. The files will show up with owner \"sftp\\-wordpress\" (that might be a **problem** for the WordPress update?) and group \"www\\-data\".\n\n**What is definitely another problem** is that uploaded files and directories are not group\\-writable, so that the Apache process won't be able to modify them. And this is a problem if WordPress wants to modify them.\n\nThe \"umask 0002\" won't help, since (unlike other questions here say) it won't *enforce* group\\-write permission.\n\nIn fact uploaded files will be group\\-writable on the server, **if** they were group\\-writable on the client \\- that's far from a solution, since you can't expect that SFTP will fix this on their side.\n\n**I'd like to hear if there is a consistent solution for this setup of WordPress.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The chroot directory needs to be owned by root in order for openssh to accept it, it's for security purposes.\n\nFor further explanation see: [bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component](https://serverfault.com/questions/584986/bad-ownership-or-modes-for-chroot-directory-component)\n\n> **ChrootDirectory**  \n> \n>  Specifies the pathname of a directory to chroot(2\\) to after\n>  authentication. ***All components of the pathname must be root\\-owned \n>  directories that are not writable by any other user or\n>  group***. After the chroot, sshd(8\\) changes the working directory\n>  to the user's home directory.\n\nI think a solution could be to separate the upload location from where it will be viewable by wordpress.\n\nYou could create kind of a staging area where the user can upload files through the openssh sftp server in a chrooted location. Then your system has a cronjob which runs a script at regular intervals which will check the upload location and does whatever is appropriate with the uploaded files.\n\nIt could just send an email asking for human intervention, or it does some automated file checking, virus scans, whatever you think may be worthwhile. Then copy or move the file to the location where wordpress can handle it.\n\nI think there is not really a consistent solution as many situations are quite unique. But using a staging area for uploaded files is not uncommon for many purposes.

According to the OpenSSH documentation, the ChrootDirectory and all components of its pathname must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group.

The total load of the three 18W bulbs is only 54W, so a 75W transformer provides adequate power with some headroom for voltage drop. Using a significantly oversized transformer like 120W is unnecessary and can lead to increased energy consumption.\n\n12 gauge wire is appropriate for this application due to the distance involved (up to 40 feet total) and the current draw. It provides less voltage drop than 14 gauge wire, ensuring the lights receive sufficient power.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 14 gauge wire may result in too much voltage drop over the distances involved.\nOption B uses an unnecessarily large transformer.\nOption D combines an oversized transformer with undersized wire.\n\nTherefore, the best combination is a 75W transformer with 12 gauge wire (option C), which provides sufficient power and appropriate wire thickness for the given setup."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/27", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2492638", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/487589/"], "docs_id": 2492638, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently learning measure theory and part of an exercise I am doing requires me to show the set $\\\\{(0,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\mid \\-1 \\\\leq y \\\\leq 1\\\\}$ is measurable. \n\nHere are the definitions I know\n\n> By the **outer measure** of a set $A \\\\subset E$, $E$ the closed unit\n>  square, is meant the number $$ \\\\mu^{\\*}(A) \\= \\\\inf\\_{A \\\\subset\n>  \\\\bigcup\\_{k} P\\_k}\\\\sum\\_{k} m(P\\_{k}), $$ where the greatest lower bound\n>  is taken over all coverings of $A$ by a finite or countable system of\n>  rectangles $P\\_{k}$.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> By the **inner measure** of a set $A \\\\subset E$ is meant the number\n>  $$\\\\mu\\_{\\*}(A) \\= 1 \\- \\\\mu^{\\*}(E \\\\setminus A)$$\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> A set $A$ is said to be **(Lebesgue) measurable** if $$\\\\mu\\_{\\*}(A) \\=\n>  \\\\mu^{\\*}(A),$$i.e., if its inner and outer measures coincide.\n\nI also showed in a previous exercise that the outer measure may be defined in terms of open sets $$\\\\mu^{\\*}(A) \\= \\\\inf\\\\{\\\\mu(G) \\\\mid A \\\\subseteq G \\\\text{ and } G \\\\text{ is open in }E\\\\}$$\n\nNow, let $A \\= \\\\{(0,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\mid \\-1 \\\\leq y \\\\leq 1\\\\}$.

This can be shown using a similar approach to the one used for the line segment in the original question:\n\n1. We can cover A with a countable collection of rectangles with arbitrarily small total area. For example, for any \u03b5 > 0, we can cover the circle with 4/\u03b5 squares of side length \u03b5, centered at points on the circle.\n\n2. The outer measure of A is therefore zero: \u03bc*(A) = 0, as we can make the total area of the covering rectangles arbitrarily small.\n\n3. Since the outer measure is zero, and we know that for any set X, 0 \u2264 \u03bc\u208b(X) \u2264 \u03bc*(X), we can conclude that the inner measure is also zero: \u03bc\u208b(A) = 0.\n\n4. As the inner and outer measures are equal (both zero), A is measurable by definition.\n\n5. The measure of A is this common value: zero.\n\nOption A is incorrect because measurability is not determined by the presence of interior points. Option B is incorrect because while \u03c0 is the circumference of the unit circle, it's not its measure as a subset of \u211d\u00b2.

That seems adequately answered by the simple observation that, like 'doctored' human beings, 'doctored' food or drink at least for a time *appeared* to be better or stronger."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the development of the negative connotation of the verb \"to doctor\" in English?\n\nA) It originated from the practice of medical doctors falsifying patient records.\nB) It evolved from the use of \"doctor\" as slang for adulterating food or drink to improve its appearance or taste.\nC) It came from the academic practice of altering research results to obtain degrees.\nD) It developed from the church fathers' habit of modifying religious texts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The negative connotation of \"to doctor\" meaning to alter, falsify, or tamper with something dishonestly, appears to have developed from earlier slang or colloquial use of the noun \"doctor\" to refer to substances used to adulterate food or drink. This usage is attested from 1770, referring to additives that made beverages appear better or stronger than they actually were. The verb form in this negative sense is recorded from 1774, suggesting a progression from the noun usage to the verb with its implications of deception or falsification.

Look at the package entity framework extended <https://github.com/loresoft/EntityFramework.Extended>. It is as simple as adding method .FromCache () to the query you use to retrieve and filter the data and it will cache the query result. Make sure you load all the data required using includes etc.\n\nYou wouldn't have to worry about same search in model as the caching provider would look at filter settings and determine that it was different. Alternatively cache the data before filtering and then filter the cached results. This is more appropriate if you have lots of filter parameters with significant variance as you will only have to cache 1 large result rather than thousands of smaller results. \n\nYou can get more advanced and specify cache period e.g. Cache for 10 minutes"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on optimizing a search feature in their application that uses Entity Framework for data access.

Having a solution that checks for each shell type is fine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to make a first\\-stage stab at this. Someone else will hopefully improve. \n\nBefore executing your script, the shell will open a file\\-descriptor to the file. Usually this is assigned at fd 255\\. At any rate, if there's an open `fd`, then `lsof` can find it. So we use `lsof -p $$` and get the highest\\-file\\-descriptor's filename. `lsof` won't work with every flavor of unix. The wiki for BSD says the equivalent there is `fstat`. It seems to be on Darwin (Mac OS). With \\`\\-F\n\nA sample script:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nthis_script_path=`lsof -p $$  | awk '/\\/'${0##*/}'$/' | cut -c 55-`\n\n```\n\nObviously, the cutting is very dependent on specific formatting of lsof. We can alleviate this in version 2\\. BTW: My version of `lsof` translates unprintable characters so that even tabs in path names get converted to `\\t`. \n\n**Version 2**. Apologies in advanced for the ugly perl code. This time we're going to use the `-F` option to control the output. With `-F fn` we will get output like this:\n\n```\np3834\nfcwd\nn/home/joe/test\nfrtd\nn/\nftxt\nn/bin/bash\nfmem\nn/lib64/ld-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libdl-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libc-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libtinfo.so.5.7\nfmem\nn/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive\nfmem\nn/usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.cache\nf0\nn/dev/pts/1\nf1\nn/dev/pts/1\nf2\nn/dev/pts/1\nf255\nn/home/joe/test/t.sh\n\n```\n\nWe've got to convert that mess so that the highest file\\-descriptor (I'm assuming you can't rely on it being 255\\) is the script\\-name. (This seems to work in `dash` as well.)\n\n```\nthis_script_path=`lsof -p $$ -F fn | \n  perl -lane '\n        $fd=$1,next if /^f(\\d+)/; \n        $p{$fd}=$1 if $fd and /^n(.*)/;\n        $fd=\"\";\n  }END { \n        @x=sort {$a<=>$b} keys %p;\n        print $p{$x[-1]}; \n  }{'`\n\n```\n\nThe perl script is ugly, I agree. It was a one\\-liner that I broke up for clarity. We capture the number of the file\\-descriptor if the line begins with `f`, and we capture the filename into a hash if we have a valid file\\-descriptor and valid filename. Just in case, if none of those conditions were met, we clear `$fd`. After all lines are processed, we numerically sort the keys (our file\\-descriptors) of our hash, store the results into array `x` and outputs the contents of the hash `p` of filenames, indexed by the last element (the greatest value) in array `x`.\n\nThe only question is: will lsof be installed on all the systems and how stable is this output format."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following methods is described as a reliable way to get the path of the directory containing the running script across multiple shell environments?\n\nA) Using $BASH_SOURCE variable\nB) Using pwd command\nC) Using lsof command with perl processing\nD) Using readlink command\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation describes a method using the lsof command combined with perl processing as a potential reliable solution across different shells.

I am wondering if conservation of energy holds beyond that special case; it seems that it should. After all, if a property holds only under special cases then the property is not a law.\n\nReading Feynman's lecture 14 volume I, I understand that if only conservative forces act on an object its total energy remains unchanged. For example, a falling object subject only to gravity has a constant sum of kinetic and potential energies. However, the system consisting of just this object is *not* an isolated system because it is subject to the external force of gravity. It seems this is an instance of conservation of energy holding outside the special case of an isolated system.\n\nFeynman argues that at the fundamental level all forces are in fact conservative. This implies that at the fundamental level conservation of energy applies to all systems. Is this true? If so, why is conservation of energy continually stated under the special case of an isolated system?\n\n(this site's \"energy\\-conservation\" tag says \"the amount of energy in a system is constant\" implying the system need not be isolated, further confusing me)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are different ways of stating conservation of energy and accounting for energy, which can make the issue confusing. One such statement is \"the total energy of an isolated system is constant\". This is true, and is the simplest way to state conservation of energy. This form of conservation of energy is the earliest taught.\n\nThere's another way of stating conservation of energy, \"the energy in a region changes by the amount of energy flowing into or out of a region, and energy in adjacent regions changes by the same amount\". You could call this local conservation of energy, and is a much stronger statement. It not only tells us that energy is conserved, but it also tells us that energy can't disappear from a region and reappear far away. This is the kind of conservation of energy that Feynman is considering, so he can apply it to systems that aren't isolated."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is studying a non-isolated system where an object falls under the influence of gravity.

Since $G$ and $\\\\Omega BG$ have the homotopy types of CW complexes, the map $i$ is in fact a homotopy equivalence. \n\nI am interested in whether an explicit homotopy inverse $h: \\\\Omega BG \\\\to G$ to $i$ can be given by taking [holonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy#Holonomy_of_a_connection_in_a_principal_bundle) of loops with respect to some suitably chosen connection on the universal bundle. Naturally the \"manifold\" $BG$ is infinite\\-dimensional, but I'm thinking it would suffice to work with the finite\\-dimensional $G$\\-bundles $V\\_m \\\\to G\\_m$ (Stiefel to Grassmann) which approximate to the direct limits above, provided that the connections on each of the approximating bundles are compatible with respect to inclusion into the next, \"compatible\" here having an obvious sense in terms of $G$\\-valued holonomy. \n\nHas anyone seen this idea worked out? Naturally I'm curious also about whether a similar idea works out for a general compact Lie group $G$. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, certainly. The model for BG as you described it has a canonical, universal connection\nfor its $SO(n)$ bundle: just the induced Riemannian connection from Euclidean space.\n\nAs you\nmove an $n$\\-dimensional plane in $\\\\mathbb E^{n\\+m}$, the induced connection\nis the limit of compositions\n of orthogonal projections between nearby planes. In the limit, these become isometries.\nIt doesn't matter what is the dimension of the ambient space, as long as the projection is\ndefined. So, a loop in the Grassmanian gives an element of $G$. One example: if you\nhold a bicycle wheel by its axle, and move it around in a loop, when it comes back, it has\nrotated by some angle. That's the map.\n\nIt's a homotopy inverse of the map going the other way, namely, the classifying map for\nthe bundle obtained by the suspension of an element of $G$. The suspension of a homomorphism\nhas a canonical connection; its holonomy is $G$, so one composition of these two maps\nequals the identity. The other composition is homotopic to the identity, basically\nbecause the space of connections is contractible, and the bundle $EG$ over this model\nof $BG$ has a universal connection: Every connection on every $SO(n)$ bundle over \na $CW$ complex $X$ is induced from a map $X \\\\rightarrow BG$ (and this is also true\nin a relative form). This is a standard fact;\n I don't have a handy reference, but the proof is \"soft\". \n\nHowever, to get a more immediate classifying space for connections that works\nfor all Lie groups, just make\na simplicial complex whose simplices are connections for a $G\\-bundles$ over the simplex.\nThe $G$\\-bundle is specified by in terms of a trivialization associated with each vertex;\nthe data needed is the chart\\-transition cocyle. In addition, give a connection;\nthis amounts to specifying a connection form. Glue these simplices with $G$\\-bundles\nand connections together, to make a model for $BG$. Since the space of connections\nis contractible, this has the same homotopy type as the more usual model for $BG$ where just\nthe cocycle is specified.\n\nThe same construction works to give an explicit homotopy inverse\nin a much more general context, e.g. the group of diffeomorphisms for a manifold."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the classifying bundle of the compact Lie group SO(n).

According to the documentation, if you reload the world without the map in your hands, it will not show your position or update as you move around. To ensure the map updates properly and displays your position, you need to reload the world with the map equipped in your hands.\n\nOption A is incorrect because having the map in your inventory is not sufficient; it needs to be in your hands.\nOption B is incorrect because quitting to the title screen will reload the map, but it doesn't specifically address the issue of updating your position.\nOption D is incorrect because simply opening the map after reloading isn't mentioned as a solution; the key is having the map in your hands during the reload process.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of the specific game mechanic related to map updating in The Witcher 2, as described in the documentation."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/310982", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/136392/"], "docs_id": 310982, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to convert the outputs of a model into a raster based on both a temperature raster and a seasonality raster.
