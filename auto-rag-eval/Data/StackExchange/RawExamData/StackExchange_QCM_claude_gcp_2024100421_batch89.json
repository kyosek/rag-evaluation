However, this solution may not be feasible if the space between the existing studs is not at least 3 inches wider than the required rough opening for the pet door. This is because adding a jack stud narrows the opening by 1.5 inches on each side (total of 3 inches).

Does there exist a measurable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ all of whose projections are non\\-measurable? As with many such questions, there is an easy solution based on the general principle that measure\\-zero sets in the plane can be very nasty: you can just take your favourite non\\-measurable set in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and think of it as a subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\.$ \n\nJust for fun, here is a meta\\-question: is there a way of somehow ruling out any use of this principle and thereby obtaining a more challenging question? One idea that fails miserably is to insist that the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ has positive measure. That fails because all you have to do is take the union of a nasty measure\\-zero set with a token nice set of positive measure that doesn't cause any of the projections to become measurable.

HTML and web\\-pages were still germinal. Google wouldn't have had anything to search, had it existed. Nowadays Google is an incredibly convenient way of finding almost anything \\-\\- not just solutions to mathematics problems, but even friends you lost track of 20\\+ years ago. \n\nMy question concerns how Google (and to a lesser extent other technological advances) has changed the landscape for you. Specifically, when you're teaching proofs. More details on what I'm getting at:\n\nA \"rite of passage\" homework problem in the 2nd year multi\\-variable calc/analysis course at the University Alberta was the Cantor\\-Schroeder\\-Bernstein theorem. In the 3rd year there was the Kuratowski closure/14\\-set theorem. It's not very useful to ask students to prove such theorems on homework assignments nowadays, since the \"pull\" of Google is too strong. They easily find proofs of these theorems *even if they're not deliberately searching for them*. The reason I value these \"named\" traditional problems is primarily that they are fairly significant problems where a student, after they've completed the problem, can look back and know they've proven (on their own) some kind structural theorem \\- they know they're not just proving meaningless little lemmas, as the theorems have historical significance. As these kinds of accomplishments accumulate, students observe they've learned to some extent how an area develops and what it takes in terms of contributions of new ideas, dogged deduction, and so on. \n\nI'm curious to what extent you've adapted to this new dynamic. I have certainly noticed students being able to look\\-up not just named theorems but also relatively simple, arbitrary problems. After all, even if you create a problem that you think is novel, it's rather unlikely that this is the case \\- sometimes students find your problem on a 3\\-year\\-old homework assignment on a course webpage half\\-way around the planet, even if it's new to you. \n\nAs Jim Conant mentioned in the comments, this is a relatively new thing. When I was an undergraduate, going to the library meant a 30\\-minute walk each way, then the decision process of trying to figure out what textbook to look in, frequently a long search that led me to learning something interesting that I hadn't planned on, and frequently not finding what I set out to find. But type in part of your problem into Google and it brings you to the exact line of all the textbooks in which it appears. It brings up all the home\\-pages where the problem appears and frequently solutions keys, if not Wikipedia pages on the problem \\-\\- I've deleted more than one Wikipedia page devoted to solutions to particular homework problems.\n\nOf course there are direct ways to adapt: asking relatively obscure questions. And there's \"denying the problem\" \\- the idea that good students won't (deliberately or accidentally) look up solutions. IMO this underestimates how easy it is to find solutions nowadays. And it underestimates how diligent students have to be in order to succeed in mathematics. \n\nAny insights welcome. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How would you teach anything in an age when the \"arcana\" or guild secrets had been made public?

Somebody may be able to catch something in the workflow that would solve your problem before it becomes an issue. If this question is related to code in [Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable) : unable to find an inherited method for function \u2018shapefile\u2019 for signature \u2018\"NULL\"\u2019](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/243313), it is very relevant that you provide some background in your workflow. \n\nThere is really no need to convert your shapefile(s) into a flat file csv format to remove zero values in a column. You can read them using readOGR and then delete zero column values. If done correctly, the entire spatial object will be subset. \n\nThis does however, raise a question; why do you have zero values in a coordinates column? If they were originally shapefiles, the coordinates are inherent in the data and could be compared to what is in the data.frame column to see if, indeed, they are missing or zero values. If they are not missing then you could populate the columns using the sp:coordinates function. Please keep in mind that you do not need coordinates in the attribute table of shapefiles or spatial class objects in R and you can have a valid feature with invalid values in an attribute column. \n\nTo directly address your question, you seem like a bit of a novice R user so, a `for` loop would be most appropriate solution here. The use of `which` returns a position index of the query but, in this case there is no need to use it. A simple index query will delete/retain rows in your data.frame in a single step. \n\nIn this example, I am coercing the data into an sp spatial class object and then writing a shapefile, with the same name as the csv file.

This is evidenced by the user's statement that changes only appear when editing the file in the GeoNode package directory (/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/geonode/templates/index.html). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the user mentioned running the collectstatic command.\nOption B is unlikely as the user followed the documentation for file locations.\nOption C is also unlikely as the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting includes both the custom and default template directories.\n\nThe correct solution would involve ensuring that the custom template directory takes precedence over the default GeoNode templates, possibly by adjusting the order in the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting or by using a different approach to override the default templates."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/19", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/175014", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/61635/"], "docs_id": 175014, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to sort on multiple columns a file with GNU sort.\n\nThe format of the source file tmp/file.txt is :\n\n```\n03A12345679   2014-09-30-00.00.01.00\n\n```\n\n* \"03\" \\=\\> first column\n* \"A\" \\=\\> field separator\n* \"12345679 \" \\=\\> second column\n* \"2014\\-09\\-30\\-00\\.00\\.01\\.00\" \\=\\> other column (not sorted)\n\nI've tried this command :\n\n```\nsort --field-separator=\"A\" -k2,11 -k1,2 tmp/file.txt > tmp/file_out.txt\n\n```\n\nWith :\n\n* `--field-separator=\"A\"` \\=\\> field separator is \"A\"\n* `-k2,11` \\=\\> the second column is the first sort (\"12345679 \")\n* `-k1,2` \\=\\> the first column is the second sort (\"03\")\n\nBut in the result the sort is not correct (the \"03\" is before the \"01\" and \"02\" lines) :\n\n```\n03A12345679   2014-09-30-00.00.01.000000-0000\n01A12345679   12345679  132132155VDVLDLV\n02A12345679   FONDSEURO   000012664,120000000M\n02A12345679   FR09999956570000009999,999990000F\n01A12345680   472958519598601200000000047295824\n02A12345680   122121EUR     0000099999,370000000M\n\n```\n\nI want to have this result :\n\n```\n01A12345679   12345679  132132155VDVLDLV\n02A12345679   FONDSEURO   000012664,120000000M\n02A12345679   FR09999956570000009999,999990000F\n03A12345679   2014-09-30-00.00.01.000000-0000\n01A12345680   472958519598601200000000047295824\n02A12345680   122121EUR     0000099999,370000000M\n\n```\n\nHow can i do that ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You seem to be mixing up field positions and character positions.

That is, imagine we were clever enough to change the Higgs v.e.v. to any finite value we wished. What could it be useful for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The HIggs field appears with [spontaneous symmetry](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/unify.html) breaking \n\n> The photon , the particle involved in the electromagnetic interaction, along with the W and Z provide the necessary pieces to unify the weak and electromagnetic interactions. With masses around 80 and 90 Gev, respectively, the W and Z were the most massive particles seen at the time of discovery while the photon is massless. The difference in masses is attributed to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the hot universe cooled. The theory suggests that at very high temperatures where the equilibrium kT energies are in excess of 100 GeV, these particles are essentially identical and the weak and electromagnetic interactions were manifestations of a single force. The question of how the W and Z got so much mass in the spontaneous symmetry breaking is still a perplexing one. The symmetry\\-breaking mechanism is called a Higgs field, and requires a new boson, the Higgs boson to mediate it.\n\nSo the question really asks if one can control the symmetry [breaking energy](http://www.clab.edc.uoc.gr/materials/pc/proj/running_alphas.html) , when the [higgs field](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-higgs-boson.pdf) appears as the [electromagnetic and weak coupling constants](http://www.clab.edc.uoc.gr/materials/pc/proj/running_alphas.html) run into each other.\n\nIt is maybe good to think about an [analogue in classical physics, a magnet:](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/unify.html#c4/)\n\n> When the magnet is strongly magnetized in one direction, it would be hard to guess that the underlying interaction is actually symmetric under rotation. The magnetic field from the magnet is certainly very different if it is rotated 90 degrees, or 180 degrees. The underlying symmetry can only be seen if the energy of the system is raised \\- heating the magnet to its Curie temperature would remove the directional magnetic field and restore the rotational symmetry of the material.\n\nI find that the Curie temperature can be [a function of directions](http://journals.aps.org/archive/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.124.1373) :\n\n> In an anisotropic ferromagnet the Curie temperature is a function of the direction of the magnetization. The Curie temperature is high in easy directions, and can drop quite low in harder directions for an anisotropy energy comparable to the exchange energy. Magnetization curves as a function of temperature also depend upon the orientation. In sufficiently hard directions, the magnetization drops from a large value precipitously to zero at the Curie temperature.\n\nThis last allows one to imagine that the v.e.v. of 246GeV might be negotiable for some width, i.e. in some specific boundary conditions, but the balances that lead to symmetry breaking have to hold in order to observe the world we observe and have encoded into the standard model. So turning off for the whole universe will both not be possible or desirable ( well it did happen in the [Big Bang history](http://planck.caltech.edu/epo/epo-planckScience5.html) at o.1 ns) . Maybe some of these compactified dimensions from strings would give a handle to explore changes in v.e.v. s , if we ever are experimentally sure they exist ;) and can experiment with them. (i.e. allow to modify the boundary conditions that define the electroweak parameters for some specific experiment) \n\nAt the moment we have to pursue higher energy experiments with leptons in order to get a handle with enough accuracy to explore differences in coupling constants while approaching the unification energy. This last for the electroweak unification into one coupling constant is at a scale of 10^12 GeV ."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: If we could hypothetically manipulate the Higgs field's vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) in a localized region, which of the following would be the most likely outcome?\n\nA) All particles in that region would become massless, causing matter to instantly disintegrate\n\nB) The strength of the electromagnetic and weak interactions would remain unchanged in that region\n\nC) The Curie temperature of magnetic materials in that region would be altered, potentially changing their magnetic properties\n\nD) The speed of light would increase dramatically in that region, allowing for faster-than-light travel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Higgs field's v.e.v. is closely related to the symmetry breaking that gives particles their mass and distinguishes the electromagnetic from the weak interaction. While changing it dramatically could have profound effects on particle masses and fundamental forces, the analogy with magnetic materials and their Curie temperature suggests that more subtle effects might be observable with smaller changes. \n\nThe Curie temperature of a magnetic material, which determines its magnetic properties, can be direction-dependent and is related to symmetry breaking in a way analogous to the Higgs mechanism. Therefore, manipulating the Higgs field's v.e.v. in a localized region might alter the Curie temperature and magnetic properties of materials in that region, making option C the most plausible outcome among the given choices.\n\nOptions A and B are too extreme, as a small change in the Higgs v.e.v. wouldn't necessarily cause complete loss of mass or leave interactions entirely unchanged.

It's also bounded above. $sup S\\=3$ also exists in $\\\\mathbb Q$. But the set of rational numbers does not have a supremum!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My answer will have to be \"yes and no\".\n\nIn the formal sense, the answer is no. $\\\\ell^p$ consists of elements of the form $a: \\\\mathbb N \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb C$. However, such a finite sequence is something of the form $a: \\\\{1, \\\\dots, N\\\\} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb C$. This is not a function with domain $\\\\mathbb N$ so strictly speaking it is not in $\\\\ell^p$.\n\nHowever, I think this question relates to a deeper concept than mere formalism \\- it's about how math is communicated. We are not always so strict in math. Surely, speaking strictly is useful. We must be precise when doing math, as subtle errors abound, especially when one is encountering a new topic. However, we often abuse notation and speak more loosely when we are working practically, as strictness can become cumbersome. Ultimately, math is a communicative process. What you write down is meant to be understood by another person doing math. If I read \"$\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$\" it would be immediately clear to me that what you meant is the extension by $0$ you describe. This is a routine thing to do, and contextually the meaning is clear. It may even be annoying for a reader if you were to belabor this point, but this depends on your audience. As with any form of speech, the particular language mathematicians use has imprecisions that are filled in by contextual understanding. It's the duty of a good author to determine what things their audience can pick up from context and what things must be spelled out.\n\nLet me give another example. Is $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$? Well sure, we say this all the time. But often we consider $\\\\mathbb C$ to be the set $\\\\mathbb R^2$ with additional structure. Elements of $\\\\mathbb R^2$ are pairs of real numbers, and a real number is not a pair of real numbers, so if we again insist on speaking strictly, then it's not true that $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$. But this is pedantry. We do freely think about the real numbers as sitting in the complex numbers without caring that on a technical set theoretic level it may not be strictly true. On that note, objects are not always even well defined. Are complex numbers pairs of real numbers? Cosets in $\\\\mathbb R\\[x]/(x^2 \\+ 1\\)$? Are real numbers equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences? Dedekind cuts? None of these sets contain one another, but does it really matter? When I say $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$ or $\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$, I expect my audience to be able to infer the meaning of these statements without my having to spell out all the little details. Doing so would be tedious for both me as an author, and for the reader to actually read.\n\nI'll leave you with some rough guidelines, but I myself am a novice in mathematical writing. I'd encourage you to seek out experts who have written about this, such as [Terry Tao on his blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/) (EDIT: [This](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/on-compilation-errors-in-mathematical-reading-and-how-to-resolve-them/) particular post on \"compilation errors\" is especially relevant) or any personal mentors you have. Additionally, having peers and members of your intended audience comment on what you've written is deeply important.\n\nFirst and foremost, especially as a beginner, is to be correct and precise. You must be completely sure that everything you write down is correct, and that any skipped details are things you can readily fill in if asked. If you write down $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$ or $\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$, be prepared to defend it!\n\nSecondly, think about who your audience is. Are you writing homework for a class? Perhaps then the grader will want to see every detail spelled out to determine if you are indeed capable of doing so. Are you preparing lecture notes for people learning analysis for the first time? Maybe this abuse of notation would confuse them. For advanced graduate students? They're probably used to things like this. Are these notes just for you? Are they for a textbook? Each audience and medium will have different expectations and standards. You should consider what your audience is likely to know, how much time they have to sit and digest the material itself, and what constraints the medium imposes \\- like if you have only an hour for a talk."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is preparing a paper on sequence spaces for a journal.

And the derivatives appear in the form of a gradient or a divergence.\n\nWhat are the reasons benind that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I finally figured out. The statement that only electrons within a few $k\\_BT$ around $E\\_F$ contributes to a current when an electric field is applied to a metal is not universally true. This roughly holds when $k\\_BT \\>\\> e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$ where $L\\_m$ is the mean free path. For a reasonable current, the statement holds for almost all temperatures, i.e. above $1$ K.\n\nThe reason can be understood by considering 2 cases.\n\n**First case: T\\= absolute zero**. At that temperature, the Fermi surface is perfectly sharp and if the statement would be true, then only the electrons exactly at the Fermi surface would contribute to a current, but this is wrong as can be seen from the countless displaced Fermi sphere pictures found in textbooks (and showed here in the answer by Pieter). Even at $0$ K, as Datta mathematically shows, the electrons that have an energy above $E\\_F \\- e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$ all do contribute to the current. In that case the energy window around $E\\_F$ is indeed of width $2e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$. In Pieter's figure of the Fermi sphere, only the crescent between the displaced and non displaced spheres contributes to the current. The maximum energy of these electrons is proportional to the applied $\\\\vec E$ field strength ($v\\_d$ is proportional to it).\n\n**Second case: Finite temperature**. In that case before applying the electric field, the Fermi surface isn't sharp, it is blurred. This means that there unoccupied states below $E\\_F$ and occupied states above $E\\_F$, all within a few $k\\_BT$ (because of the Pauli exclusion principle, as you've already pointed out). Nevertheless, it is very important to realize that there are unoccupied states within a few $k\\_BT$ around $E\\_F$. So that when another perturbation, such as an electric field, is applied, then all these electrons around $E\\_F$ by a few $k\\_BT$ can interact with the $\\\\vec E$ field and get their energy increased (because they have unoccupied states above them). Here it is assumed that the electric field is a smaller perturbation than $k\\_BT$. For if the electric's field magnitude was gigantic, then even electrons with a much lower energy than $E\\_F\\-k\\_BT$ would be able to interact with the field and contribute to the current. You can picture this in the usual Fermi sphere figure as a huge displacement compared to the radius of the sphere, rather than a very tiny displacement (for ordinary current the real \"displacement\" is so tiny that it wouldn't be distinguishable to the naked eye on these figures)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a metal at finite temperature, when an electric field is applied, which statement most accurately describes the electrons contributing to the current?\n\nA) Only electrons exactly at the Fermi level contribute to the current.\n\nB) All electrons in the metal contribute equally to the current, regardless of their energy.\n\nC) Electrons within approximately kBT of the Fermi level contribute most significantly to the current, assuming kBT >> e|E|Lm.\n\nD) Only electrons below the Fermi level contribute to the current due to the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: At finite temperatures, the Fermi surface is blurred, with both occupied and unoccupied states within a few kBT around the Fermi level (EF). When an electric field is applied, electrons within this energy range can interact with the field and contribute to the current, as they have unoccupied states available above them. This is true when kBT >> e|E|Lm, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, e is electron charge, E is the electric field strength, and Lm is the mean free path. Option A is incorrect as it's too restrictive, even at absolute zero. Option B is incorrect as not all electrons contribute equally.

When created, topology is created as a set of tables in a new schema: node, edge\\_data, face, and relation. Then you can start to add linestrings and polygons to the topology (using, for example,`TopoGeo_AddLineString()` and `TopoGeo_AddPolygon()`). These functions do the work of creating nodes, edges and faces in the topology as feature geometries are added and the intersections are detected.\n\nPostGIS topology supports topogeometries. These are geometries composed out of topology primitives (edges, nodes, faces) or other topogeometries. You can think, in the simplest case, of a topogeometry as the list of identifiers of shareable topology elements that constitute that feature. For example, a road centerline topogeometry would be a list of edges that might also be used as parts of faces forming neighbourhoods in a different table defining area topogeometries.\n\n[*PostGIS in Action, 3rd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/postgis-in-action-third-edition), Chapter 13, by Leo S. Hsu and Regina O. Obe, provides a good introductory overview of PostGIS topology, first using a simplified topology of Colorado divided by interstate highways and then using the neighbourhoods of Victoria, B.C. to demonstrate the ideas. (I'm not affiliated with the authors or the publisher \\- I have used it in a course)\n\nQGIS provides a handy viewer for PostGIS topology in its DB Manager interface (Schema \\-\\> TopoViewer).\n\nUpdate \\- example\n=================\n\nAll of the work below was done using psql, except for the use of QGIS to create the topology image (TopoViewer).\n\nCreate a pair of overlapping geometries.\n----------------------------------------\n\n```\n-- might need to disconnect / reconnect for postgis and topology paths to be picked up properly\n-- after creating these extensions and updating the search_path\nCREATE SCHEMA postgis;\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis SCHEMA postgis;\nALTER DATABASE set search_path=contrib,public,postgis,topology;\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;\n\n-- create table to hold overlapping polygons and then insert them\nCREATE TABLE poly (\n  id serial PRIMARY KEY,\n  geom Geometry(POLYGON, 32618)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO poly (geom) VALUES\n                        (ST_Polygon('LINESTRING(75 29, 77 29, 77 31, 75 31, 75 29)'::geometry, 32618)),\n                        (ST_Polygon('LINESTRING(76 30, 78 30, 78 32, 76 32, 76 30)'::geometry, 32618));\n\n```\n\nNow create a new topology and insert the geometries.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nResults in a new schema containing the required tables edge\\_data, face, node and relation.\n\n```\n-- create a topology and push geomtries from poly into it\nSELECT CreateTopology('polytopo', 32618);\n\nSELECT \n  id, \n  TopoGeo_AddPolygon('polytopo', geom) As face_id\n  FROM (\n    SELECT id, geom \n      FROM poly\n  ) As f;\n\n```\n\nInserting these polygons into the topology will result in updates to the topology tables. Using the QGIS TopoViewer and displaying the directed edges shows the following structure. There are three marked faces (1, 2 and 3\\) although there is actually a fourth \\- the universal face (0\\) not shown. Edges 1 through 6 are labelled and the grey circles are the topology nodes.\n\n[![View of topology created by inserting polygons](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1xXjv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1xXjv.png)\n\nList edges for faces.\n---------------------\n\nPostGIS topology includes constructor functions and topology accessors. To list the edge IDs for a specific face, use [`ST_GetFaceEdges()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GetFaceEdges.html). This dumps all edges for a given face (quoting from the documentation):\n\n> Enumeration of each ring edges start from the edge with smallest\n> identifier. Order of edges follows a left\\-hand\\-rule (bound face is on\n> the left of each directed edge).\n\nThe following query lists all edges for all faces. Here each edge is its own row. I'll aggregate the edges for each list into an ordered array below.\n\n```\n-- show ordered edges for faces\nWITH faces AS (\n  SELECT face_id FROM polytopo.face\n)\nSELECT face_id,\n       (ST_GetFaceEdges('polytopo', face_id)).*\n  FROM faces\n ORDER BY face_id, sequence;\n\n```\n\nThe result of the above is shown below. Negative edge IDs indicate that the ordered traversal would go against the direction of the edge to keep the bounded area to the left of the edge. For example, the traversal of the universal face (0\\) runs against the edge direction for all arcs because the face is outside the drawn faces and therefore left of the outer arcs only when traversing them in reverse.\n\n```\n face_id | sequence | edge \n---------+----------+------\n       0 |        1 |   -1\n       0 |        2 |   -2\n       0 |        3 |   -6\n       1 |        1 |    1\n       1 |        2 |   -5\n       1 |        3 |   -3\n       1 |        4 |    2\n       2 |        1 |    3\n       2 |        2 |    5\n       2 |        3 |    4\n       3 |        1 |   -4\n       3 |        2 |    6\n(12 rows)\n\n```\n\nList edges for each face as an ordered array (single row)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am not sure if this is more useful than the query above. Depends what you are trying to do. But this is more similar to the polygon\\-arc table in the original question so I show it.\n\n```\n-- show ordered edges for faces, grouped into ordered arrays\nWITH faces AS (\n  SELECT face_id FROM polytopo.face\n), oedges AS (\n  SELECT face_id,\n         (ST_GetFaceEdges('polytopo', face_id)).*\n    FROM faces\n)\nSELECT face_id, array_agg(edge) AS edge_ids\n  FROM oedges\n GROUP BY face_id\n ORDER BY face_id;\n\n```\n\nThe result form the above query is shown below. The logic of the ordered lists is the same as for the previous query. I've removed the sequence number from the display while creating an ordered array of edge IDs.\n\n```\n face_id |  edge_ids   \n---------+-------------\n       0 | {-1,-2,-6}\n       1 | {1,-5,-3,2}\n       2 | {3,5,4}\n       3 | {-4,6}\n(4 rows)\n\n```\n\nSummary\n=======\n\nWithin the topology, only the edge\\_data table contains the boundary geometries. The face table stores only face IDs and minimum bounding boxes. Those face IDs are used in the edge table to relate each edge to the faces bounded by that edge and to store information about sequencing of edges around faces (see the table definition for details). The node table stores point geometries that are, technically, a duplication of the arc endpoint vertices but a reasonable trade\\-off for efficiency. The relation table relates topology elements, especially edges, to application feature geometries (topogeometries, mentioned earlier) that can be composed from topology elements at the lowest layer or from other topogeometries to create layered relationships within the topology (e.g., \"blocks\" could be composed from \"parcels\" that are, in turn, topology faces bounded by topology edges). In the example above, no topogeometries have been created so the relation table is still empty.\n\nAs opposed to the creation of face edge lists, shown in the examples above, face boundary geometry can be (re)created using [`ST_GetFaceGeometry()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GetFaceGeometry.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided PostGIS topology information:\n\nQuestion: In a PostGIS topology, which of the following statements is true regarding the storage and representation of polygon boundaries?\n\nA) The face table stores the complete geometry of each polygon boundary\nB) The edge_data table contains boundary geometries, while the face table stores only face IDs and bounding boxes\nC) The node table duplicates all vertex information from the edge_data table for efficiency\nD) The relation table directly stores the geometry of polygon boundaries\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the face table does not store complete polygon geometries, only face IDs and bounding boxes.\nB is correct. The edge_data table contains the actual boundary geometries, while the face table stores only face IDs and minimum bounding boxes for efficiency.\nC is partially true but overstated.

There are many ways to generalize the notion of a topology, e.g. \n\n(i) preclosure spaces (with a closure operator that is not necessarily idempotent) or equivalently\n\n(i') neighborhood system spaces (a neighborhood of a point need not contain an \"open neighborhood\" of that point) and more generally\n\n(ii) filter convergence spaces or certain net convergence spaces (e.g. Fr\u00e9chet $L$\\-spaces) satisfying some convergence axioms. \n\nThe notion of convergence spaces is strong enough to be able to speak of continuity of maps (defined by preservation of convergence). If $X$ is a convergence space then one can form the set $C(X)$ of continuous real\\-valued functions $f : X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ (where $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the convergence structure coming from its usual topology). In this way, one can at least relate such spaces to measure theory by creating the Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $Ba(X)$ on $X$ generated by $C(X)$.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Are there other known ways to connect such generalized topological structures to measure theory and probability theory on such spaces that are of interest in practice? I especially may think here of applications in functional analysis where [Beattie and Butzmann](https://books.google.de/books?id=OdwXRK-i9YgC&redir_esc=y) argue that convergence structures are more convenient than topologies (at least from a category theoretic point of view). As a standard example, the notion of almost everywhere convergence is not topological.\n2. Are there some practical applications in working with such Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebras in non\\-topological preclosure or convergence spaces? Even for topological spaces, the Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra and the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra need not coincide. (I think they do coincide if $\\\\tau$ is perfectly normal).\n3. Is the following only a trivial idea or does it lead to interesting properties: To any convergence space one can assign a topological space (the reflection of the convergence space, see [ncatlab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/convergence+space)) and thus speak of the \"associated Borel\" $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra for a convergence space.\n\nI also understand that measure theory on general topological spaces can be rather boring. Only for special topological spaces like Polish spaces or Radon spaces we may have interesting measure\\-theoretic results. So maybe there is also an interesting class of non\\-topological convergence spaces with interesting measure\\-theoretic theorems generalizing those for Radon spaces.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For question 1: There is another way to generalize the notion of a topology, different from (i), (i') and (ii): Extract an abstract notion of a compact\\-like class of sets. \n\nThe measures that are approximated from within by such compact\\-like classes have been studied, with interesting non\\-trivial results.

Saying that `this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format` is a lie.\n\nWhile the question remains a subjective one, one can draw objective conclusions by using subjective questions and answers or at least get something positive out of it. I don't think that this question is the Devil's spawn.\n\nThe answers are indeed supported by facts, references and users' own expertise and does solicit debate, polling and extended discussion. However, is that a bad thing? It you look at [In Android 6, how to deny an app permission to access the network?](https://android.stackexchange.com/q/138311/199649), you'll notice that, while there is indeed an objective answer to the question, there's also alternatives provided by the community to still answer the question in a subjective manner.\n\nBecause this website is so often a first hit on Google, I think that being open to discussion and seeking extended discussion is important.\n\nAnd, mostly, this question and its answers **are constructive**.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I may partly agree with you, in that the **not constructive** close reason was confusing and we don't use it anymore. I'm sorry it ever did exist\\-\\-or, really, mainly just that it was *called* that. It's not one of the close reasons that can be selected today. However, that question shouldn't be reopened. We would still close it if it were asked today, we would just be able to select a close reason that makes more sense. I think three of [our current close reasons](https://askubuntu.com/help/closed-questions) apply:\n\n* **Too broad.** There's really no limit to how many distinct answers could be posted. And if a single answer tried to address a large chunk of the question, it would be enormous, at least if it tried to explain its judgments. In the case of this particular sort of question, requesting a big list of answers, this overlaps with \"primarily opinion\\-based\" too (see below).\n* **Unclear.** What does \"must have\" mean? Does it mean \"greatly beneficial\"? Does it mean \"really cool and you will tell your friends\"? Does it mean \"your system isn't worth using without it\"? Does it mean \"good to know about\"? Does it mean \"more than X% of users will like it?\"\n* **Primarily opinion based.** There was hardly any standard by which to judge the appropriateness of the answers besides personal opinion. The question was not an explicit call for discussion, and to a limited extent facts and experience were *a factor* in determining what people would post and how people would vote on them. But mostly arbitrary opinions\\-\\-that is, personal preference\\-\\-was the *major factor* governing what answers would exist and how well they would be received. The top\\-voted answer recommended VLC. Why was that something people \"must have\"? Did those votes really reflect that VLC was the *most important* program to install? Did they reflect that it was important *at all*? Or did they just reflect that VLC is *generally well\\-liked*?\n\nThe question was not just subjective in the sense of not having any provably best answer, which is true of many perfectly good questions. It fell afoul of the problem that [just about every answer that might plausibly be posted was equally valid](https://askubuntu.com/help/dont-ask). This part of the existing closure explanation applied fully:\n\n> We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or expertise\n\nThe question itself contains some hints that it was never actually a good fit for our site:\n\n* If you look at what most of the text in the question is doing, it is mostly giving advice about *the special and different way one has to use the site* to answer it appropriately.\n* It emphasizes searching\\-\\-not reading, or skimming, or perusing, but *searching*\\-\\-the existing answers before posting another. That is, it was expected that most people would not actually consider what the existing answers said before writing their own. It was expected that there would be so many answers that most people who came to the question would not look at all of them.\n\nThis is to say that **the question was in effect a poll asking people what their favorite software was**, and not something that could practically answer a new Ubuntu user's question about what additional software they would be well advised to install on a fresh Ubuntu system.\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, the question was really a duplicate of [What are the most useful programs installed after setup of a vanilla Ubuntu?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1237/what-are-the-most-useful-programs-installed-after-setup-of-a-vanilla-ubuntu) which was subsequently deleted by a moderator.

They may consist of five quarks tightly bound together, but it is also possible that they are more loosely bound and consist of a three\\-quark baryon and a two\\-quark meson interacting relatively weakly with each other via pion exchange (the same force that binds atomic nuclei) in a \"meson\\-baryon molecule\n\nThe \"penta\" name is enough at the moment and this is a research question.

I've left the answers largely as they were but added to them, so at present this forms a progression of understanding; the last parts are where the best information is.\n\nShort answer: the Wikipedia page (at the time the question was posted) \\- and the OP's formula, which seems to have been the same \\- are simply wrong, for at least three different reasons. I'll leave my original discussion (which assumed that the OP and Wikipedia had it right) since that explains some issues. Better discussion follows later. The short advice: simply forget Doane. If you *must* use it, use what Wikipedia says *now*, around April 2013 (I fixed it; hopefully someone doesn't reinsert it later).\n\n---\n\nI believe that formula must refer to excess kurtosis; my reason for that is that it modifies a formula for normal data to account for non\\-normal data so you'd expect it to reproduce the unmodified one at the normal. It does that if you use excess kurtosis.\n\nThat does, however, raise the problem that the term in the log can go negative with large samples (indeed, it's possible to be be $\\\\leq 0$ at quite small $n$). I'd suggest not using it with negative excess kurtosis (I'd never use it beyond unimodality anyway; once things get multimodal you want to apply the excess kurtosis idea to *each* mode, not smooth over them!), though with mild cases (excess kurtosis just less than 0\\) and modest sample sizes it won't be a big issue.\n\nI'd also suggest that in any case it's going to give far too few bins at large sample sizes, even when it works as intended.\n\nYou may find this paper (by regular CVer [Rob Hyndman](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/159/rob-hyndman)):\n\n<http://www.robjhyndman.com/papers/sturges.pdf>\n\nof some interest. If Sturges' argument is wrong, Doane's formula has the same problem... as Rob clearly notes in the paper.\n\nIn that paper (and in this [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/862/805)) he gives a nod to the Freedman\\-Diaconis rule. In the paper he also points to the approach mentioned by Matt Wand (he refers to the working paper which doesn't seem to be online, but the subsequent paper is available if you have access):\n\n[http://www.jstor.org/discover/10\\.2307/2684697](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2684697)\n\n\\[Edit: actually a link to the working paper is on the [citeseer page](https://web.archive.org/web/20130427010303/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.9725)]\n\nThat approach involves approximately estimating particular functionals in order to get approximately optimal (in terms of mean integrated squared error, MISE) bin widths for estimating the underlying density. While these work well and give many more bins than Sturges or Doane in general, sometimes I still prefer to use more bins still, though it's usually a very good first attempt.\n\nFrankly I don't know why Wand's approach (or at the very least the Freedman\\-Diaconis rule) isn't a default pretty much everywhere.\n\nR does at least offer the Freedman\\-Diaconis calculation of the number of bins:\n\n```\n nclass.FD(rnorm(100))\n[1] 11\n nclass.FD(runif(100))\n[1] 6\n nclass.FD(rt(100,1))\n[1] 71\n\n```\n\nSee `?nclass.FD`\n\nPersonally, for me that's too few bins in the first two cases at least; I'd double both of those in spite of the fact that it might be a bit noisier than optimal. As $n$ becomes large, I think it does very well in most cases.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI decided to investigate the skewness vs kurtosis issue that @PeterFlom rightly expressed puzzlement at.\n\nI just had a look at the Doane paper wiso linked to (I'd read it before .... but that was almost 30 years ago) \\- it makes no reference to kurtosis at all, only to skewness.\n\nDoane's *actual* formula is: $K\\_e \\= \\\\log\\_2(1\\+\\\\frac{g\\_1}{\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1}})$\n\nwhere $K\\_e$ is the number of added bins, $g\\_1$ is the 3rd moment skewness. \\[Well actually, Doane, following fairly common usage of the time, uses $\\\\sqrt{b\\_1}$ for the *signed* (!) 3rd moment skewness; the origin of this particularly unedifying abuse of notation is quite old and I'm not going to pursue it, except to say that it was quite widespread and understood as including a sign, but even then it frequently led to confusion \\- indeed it looks like it fooled Doane and the referees, or an editor in the Doane paper itself \\- it's fortunately appearing much less often now.]\n\nNow at the normal, $\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1} \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6(n\\-2\\)}{(n\\+1\\)(n\\+3\\)}} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6}{n}}$  \n\n(although that approximation is pretty poor until $n$ is well past 100; Doane uses the first form).\n\nHowever, it seems that along the way someone has tried to adapt it to kurtosis (at the time I write this [Wikipedia has it in terms of kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Histogram&oldid=548769683#Number_of_bins_and_width), for example, and I don't think they made it up) \\- but there's clear reason to believe that the formula is simply wrong (note that the standard error used is that final approximation for the s.e. of the skewness I gave above). I think I've seen this use of kurtosis in several places other than Wikipedia, but besides not being in Doane's paper, it isn't present in Scott's paper, nor the Hyndman paper I point to, nor in Wand's paper. It does seem to have come from somewhere, however (i.e. I am sure it's not original to Wikipedia), because Doane doesn't have the approximation to $\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1}$. It looks like it's been played with several times before it ended up there; I'd be interested if anyone tracked it down.\n\nIt does look to me like Doane's *argument* should happily *extend* to kurtosis, but the [correct standard error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis#Sample_kurtosis) would have to be used.\n\nHowever, since Doane relies on Sturges and Sturges' argument seems to be flawed, perhaps the entire enterprise is doomed. In any case I have edited the Histogram talk page on wikipedia noting the error.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEdit 3: I have corrected the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width) (but I took the liberty of taking the absolute value of the skewness, otherwise Doane's original formula can't be used for left\\-skewed distributions as it stood \\- clearly for number of bins the sign of the skewness is immaterial). Strictly speaking I should have presented the formula in its original (wrong) form, and then explained why it doesn't make sense but I think that's problematic for several reasons \\- not least that people will be tempted to just copy the formula and ignore an explanation. I believe it actually covers Doane's original intent. In any case it's a vast improvement over the nonsense that was in the original. (Please, anyone who can access the original paper, take a look at it *and* how $\\\\sqrt{b\\_1}$ is defined and check my changes on Wikipedia to make sure it's reasonable \\- there were at least three things wrong \\- the kurtosis, the standard error, and the wrong base of logs, plus Doane's own small error.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Doane's formula for determining the number of bins in a histogram is correct?\n\nA) The original formula proposed by Doane uses kurtosis to adjust the number of bins.\n\nB) The formula 1 + log(n) + log(1 + kurtosis(data) * sqrt(n / 6.)) is the correct representation of Doane's formula.\n\nC) Doane's actual formula uses skewness, not kurtosis, to adjust the number of bins.\n\nD) The Wikipedia page's version of Doane's formula has always been accurate and consistent with the original paper.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The investigation revealed that Doane's original formula actually uses skewness, not kurtosis, to adjust the number of bins. The formula is Ke = log2(1 + g1/\u03c3g1), where Ke is the number of added bins, g1 is the 3rd moment skewness, and \u03c3g1 is the standard error of skewness. The formula involving kurtosis that was widely circulated, including on Wikipedia, was incorrect and not present in Doane's original paper. This misrepresentation likely arose from subsequent adaptations and misinterpretations of Doane's work. The Wikipedia page has since been corrected to reflect the original formula using skewness."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/18", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/170643", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/46266/"], "docs_id": 170643, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using php 7\\.0\\.17 and I was wondering if anyone would let me know what the recommended configuration for the php.ini file was.

It uses `Activator.CreateInstance(propertyInfo.PropertyType)` to create an instance of the correct type for each property, and then uses `propertyInfo.SetValue(this, instance, null)` to set the value of the property on the current object. \n\nOption A incorrectly creates a new `Object` instance for every property, which may not match the property's type. \n\nOption C incorrectly uses `typeof(propertyInfo)` instead of `propertyInfo.PropertyType`, and attempts to use indexer syntax which is not applicable for setting properties via reflection. \n\nOption D only creates new instances for properties that are currently null, and incorrectly uses `new Object()` instead of creating an instance of the correct type."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/07/08", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/533854", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/327596/"], "docs_id": 533854, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an arbitrary number of independnet bivariate normal distributions with $\\\\mu\\_i \\= \\[x\\_i,z\\_i]$ \\& $ \\\\Sigma\\_i\\=\n\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} \n\\\\sigma^2\\_{x\\_i} \\& \\\\sigma^2\\_{x\\_i,z\\_i}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n\\\\sigma^2\\_{x\\_i, z\\_i} \\& \\\\sigma^2\\_{z\\_i}\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right)\n$\n\nWhere i is arbitrarily large\n\nI want to take a linear combination of these bivariate normal distributions with weights $c \\= \\[c\\_1,...,c\\_i]$ where $\\\\sum c\\_i \\= 1$ \\& $c\\_i \\>0$\n\nObviously, the linear combination of $\\\\mu\\_{mixture} \\= \\[\\\\sum c\\_ix\\_i,\\\\sum c\\_iz\\_i]$\n\nHowever, I am not sure about the linear combination of the variance\\-covariance matrix.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can calculate this pooled \\& weighted variance\\-covariance?

In your example code, these lengths are equal to `2cm` each. The *total* widths of columns B, C, and D are, however, *not* equal to `2cm`. Instead, each column's total width equals `2cm+2\\tabcolsep`, where `\\tabcolsep` is the parameter that governs the amount of whitespace inserted to the left and right of a column. (In the standard LaTeX document classes, the default value of this parameter is `6pt`.)\n\nThe *combined* width of columns B, C, and D \\-\\- not counting the widths of the vertical bars to the left of B and to the right of D \\-\\- is \n\n```\n\\colB + \\colC + \\colD + 6\\tabcolsep + 2\\arrayrulewidth \n\n```\n\n(I'm assuming, implicitly, that the `array` package is being loaded.

It's the same kind of system you see on the input of HDMI transmitters or some LCD panels. There is usually also an I2C interface for controlling the sensor. Other sensors use the same thing but transmit via LVDS (this is very common with bare LCDs). If you want an overview of how a CMOS sensor actually works, [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor) is a good place to start.\n\nBasically you are looking at driving the sensor with a pixel clock and a few control signals to tell it when to capture and shift the pixel data out. The clock is usually on the order of at least a few dozen MHz for bare sensors (say 5MP capturing at 30 frames a second, that's 150MHz at a minimum).\n\nNewer sensors make use of the MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) standards and implement a high speed, multi\\-lane differential communications link, usually CIS\\-1 or CIS\\-2\\. Interfacing to these cameras is very difficult without specialized hardware, as it's a communications link similar to PCI Express.\n\nTo muddy the waters even more, some sensors have image processors built in to them and you talk to the image processor rather than the sensor itself. This isn't a bad thing, but it's something you need to be aware of. The image processor does all the black level adjustment, dead pixel correction, white balance, anti\\-shake, bayer compensation and other fun things that make the image sensors create such nice pictures in the first place.\n\nWithout more information from you regarding what specific module you're looking at, we can't give you a straightforward answer.\n\n**Edit 1**\n\nGiven that you want it small and simple, take a look at the [TCM8240MD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8668) as a starting point. It's $10 on Sparkfun. It's 1\\.3MP, uses an 8\\-bit parallel bus output with the standard pixel bus signals and an I2C control interface. It'll even output JPEG data for you. You can easily connect that to a CPLD/FPGA or something like a [Cypress FX2LP](http://www.cypress.com/?id=193) to give you a two\\-chip USB2 streaming camera. \n\nThat's just a starting point. As I said, different sensors have different interfaces and different requirements (this one does AWB and lots of other processing that a \"raw\\-er\" camera wouldn't do).\n\n**Edit 2**\n\nIf you don't need the digital image data, you have lots of easier options. [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11745) is essentially the guts of a regular old analogue security camera. It all depends on what you're after.\n\n**Edit 3**\n\n[This guy](http://kreature.org/ee/avr/cmos_cam/) seems to have gotten it working. The source is in the tcm820 directory.

The standard [`cksum`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/cksum.1.html) utility can be used to calculate this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator needs to implement a file integrity checking system on an OpenWrt router. They want to balance security and performance. Which of the following options best meets their requirements?\n\nA) Use sha256sum for all file integrity checks\nB) Implement MD5 for critical system files and CRC for non-critical files\nC) Use cksum for all file integrity checks\nD) Rely solely on MD5 for all file integrity checks\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) While sha256sum provides the highest security, it's the slowest option and may unnecessarily impact router performance.\n\nB) This is the best balance of security and performance. MD5 is faster than SHA256 and still secure enough for critical files, while CRC is the fastest option for non-critical files where accidental corruption is the main concern.\n\nC) While cksum (CRC) is the fastest option, it's only suitable for guarding against accidental damage, not malicious attacks. Using it for all files would leave critical system files vulnerable.\n\nD) Although MD5 is faster than SHA256, it has known weaknesses. Using it exclusively, especially for critical files, isn't the best security practice when better options are available.\n\nThe correct approach (B) leverages MD5's balance of speed and security for important files, while using the faster CRC for less critical files where accidental corruption is the primary concern."}}
