Which combination of technologies would be most appropriate to achieve this setup?\n\nA) OpenLDAP for user authentication and local storage on each computer\nB) Active Directory for user authentication and a NAS for home directory storage\nC) OpenLDAP for user authentication and a NAS for mounting /home directories\nD) Kerberos for user authentication and rsync for syncing user data between computers\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate solution for this scenario. OpenLDAP provides centralized user authentication, allowing employees to use the same login credentials across all 10 computers. Mounting the /home directories from a Network Attached Storage (NAS) ensures that each user's personal files, desktop settings, and application configurations are accessible from any computer they log into. This combination allows for a seamless experience where users can access their personalized environment regardless of which computer they use.\n\nOption A is incorrect because local storage would not allow access to personal settings across different computers. Option B uses Active Directory, which is typically associated with Windows environments and may not be the best fit for an all-Ubuntu setup. Option D with Kerberos and rsync could potentially work but would be more complex to implement and maintain compared to the NAS solution, and may not provide real-time access to user data across machines."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/05/27", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/56331252", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/9193156/"], "docs_id": 56331252, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a controller listed here which should be calling the Dapper method, however I cannot get it to execute.

Am I wasting my time trying to get a feature that doesn't work to work? If the built\\-in mail app doesn't support IMAP with X.509 client certs (ie: they only work with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync accounts), are there any 3rd party apps that do?\n\nOnly iOS 5\\.1 or newer is of interest; 5\\.1 is the version I've been testing with.\n\n---\n\nI'm the admin of a network that's required by policy to use X.509 client certificates to protect all external communication, including our IMAP mail server (Cyrus IMAPd) and SMTP server (postfix). Neither will accept a connection without the client presenting a valid X.509 client certificate. Disabling the client certificate requirement is not an option for me, and we aren't permitted to tunnel traffic in via VPN for similar reasons.\n\nWe now have iPad users who want to connect to our network, and are finding the iPad to be a bit of a problem.\n\nFor users on desktop machines we usually install Thunderbird, as it has rock solid IMAP with excellent client certificate support; it \"just works\" and is the same to support on every platform. This isn't an option for iPad.\n\nUnfortunately the iPad's built\\-in Mail app doesn't seem to cope with client certificates for IMAP. I can install our org's root cert and the user's client cert using the iPhone Configuration Utility. Both are shown as \"verified\" in Settings\\-\\>General\\-\\>Profiles. The iPad then accepts our server as trusted and omits any warnings about the server's identity not being verified.\n\nMail still fails to send a client certificate when one is demanded so the server terminates the handshake. It doesn't prompt the user to select one, nor does it automatically send the client certificate it has installed for the user that matches the CA certificate presented by the server.\n\nExamination of the traffic flow between client and server shows that the TLS negotiation fails when the iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates when client certificates are demanded by the server. See below.\n\nWhen connected to the internal network over encrypted WiFi, where no client cert is required to get mail, the device connects and downloads mail just fine. External access (public WiFi or over 3G) fails, whether I use the IMAPs port 993 with \"Use SSL\" checked or the IMAP\\+TLS port 143 with or without \"Use SSL\" checked. Other than the apparent lack of client certificate negotiation support for IMAP, it's perfect.\n\nReferences to client certificate support in [the documentation for Apple's \"Enterprise support\"](http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iPad_Business.pdf) only appear where Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync is discussed, and where Cisco VPN support is discussed.\n\nThere are a few questions on Apple's discussion forums, but no recent ones and no useful answers. I'd link to them, but Apple's forums are \"down for maintenance\" at the moment.\n\nAs a workaround I can probably set up a locked down VPN using the iPad's automatic VPN connection support to talk to a client\\-cert authed IPSec VPN that can *only* talk to the IMAP and SMTP servers on the appropriate ports plus DNS, nothing else. It'd be a pretty gruesome hack to have to perpetrate though.\n\n---\n\nBTW, the client\\<\\-\\>server conversation is:\n\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Client Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Server Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Certificate, Certificate Request, Server Hello Done\n (Sends server cert, signing root cert, \n DN of accepted client cert signer which happens to be the same as the root that signed the server cert)\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Certificate\n (empty set of certificates, zero certs included)\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Handshake failure\n\nIn other words, the server says \"this is me, I expect you to provide a certificate signed by authority to prove who you are\" and the client replies with \"Um, my papers are in this empty envelope here. Look, a cassowary!\"\n\nThe client has the root cert installed, and has a client cert installed that has the signer DN demanded by the server.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On a MacBook with no number pad, the key combination `fn``return` produces the Enter key. Individual programs can decide whether to treat the two keys as separate or the same.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The built-in Mail app on iPads fully supports IMAP with X.509 client certificates without any issues.\n\nB) The administrator should be able to easily configure the iPads to use X.509 client certificates for IMAP by installing the certificates using the iPhone Configuration Utility.\n\nC) The built-in Mail app on iPads does not appear to support X.509 client certificates for IMAP connections, and the administrator may need to explore alternative solutions.\n\nD) X.509 client certificates are only supported on iPads for Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync accounts, and cannot be used for any other email protocols.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation suggests that the built-in Mail app on iPads does not properly support X.509 client certificates for IMAP connections. The administrator installed the necessary certificates using the iPhone Configuration Utility, but the iPad still failed to send the client certificate when demanded by the server. This indicates that there are limitations in the iPad's support for this feature with IMAP.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly shows that the built-in Mail app is not working properly with X.509 client certificates for IMAP.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, although the administrator was able to install the certificates, this did not resolve the issue.\n\nOption D is too restrictive. While the documentation mentions X.509 support for Exchange ActiveSync, it doesn't definitively state that it's the only protocol supported.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges the problem and suggests that alternative solutions may be necessary, which aligns with the administrator's experience and the need to explore workarounds like VPN setup."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/15", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/256308", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/117306/"], "docs_id": 256308, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In some research paper, there are researcher used taking ANN prediction by run it multiple time and find the average result for prediction.

This method is safer than using a PEX cutter's blade, which could damage the barb and cause future leaks. It's also more practical than applying heat or using solvents, which could damage the fitting or be ineffective. The scoring and peeling method allows for clean removal without compromising the integrity of the barb for future use."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/09/04", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/47150", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/22925/"], "docs_id": 47150, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What's the command in AIX to find the first time a given hard disk was installed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have no AIX running nearby, but have you tried `lscfg -vl <devicename>` perhaps with an additional `-p` to get the platform specific informations too ?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided AIX documentation:\n\nQuestion: On an AIX system, you need to determine when a specific hard disk was first installed.

The '-v' flag provides verbose output, and '-l' allows you to specify the device name. \n\nAdding the '-p' flag, as suggested in the original answer, would provide additional platform-specific information, which could be useful for getting a more comprehensive view of the device's history and characteristics.\n\nOption A (lsdev -Cc disk) only lists devices and doesn't provide installation time information. \nOption B (iostat -d) is for monitoring I/O statistics and doesn't provide installation information. \nOption D (cfgmgr -l <devicename>) is used for configuring devices, not for retrieving their information."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/10", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/105611", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/29383/"], "docs_id": 105611, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to call a custom JS method `quickViewPopUp` like below on a `list.phtml` file in magento2\\. \n How can i do it?

Also clear your browser cache.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nI would highly recommend choosing this method over adding JS inside a template, I'm a big fan of separating the content and logic."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 2, you want to add custom JavaScript functionality to a product listing page. Which of the following approaches is the recommended way to include and initialize your custom JavaScript?\n\nA) Add an inline <script> tag at the bottom of the list.phtml template with your JavaScript code.\n\nB) Use a <script type=\"text/x-magento-init\"> tag in the template, referencing your JS file, and structure your JS file using AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition).\n\nC) Include your JavaScript file using a standard <script> tag in the <head> of the document.\n\nD) Add your JavaScript code directly to the requirejs-config.js file in your theme.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption B is the correct and recommended approach in Magento 2 for including custom JavaScript. This method uses the <script type=\"text/x-magento-init\"> tag to reference and initialize your JavaScript file. The JavaScript file itself should be structured using AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) with the define() function.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages:\n1. It allows for better separation of concerns, keeping JavaScript logic separate from HTML templates.\n2. It ensures that the JavaScript is loaded and executed at the appropriate time, after the DOM elements it depends on are available.\n3.

Should the view generally \"breakdown\" the data into a more generic type of integers and strings for the model?

If the integration test has failed recently, then there was a defect that was not caught by the unit tests.\n\nMy preference would generally be to increase the robustness of the integration tests, to the point where they can be reliably run unattended. If they take a long time to run, then run them overnight. They are still valuable even if they are only run occasionally. If these tests are too fragile or require manual intervention, then it may not be worth the time spent in keeping them running, and you may consider discarding those that succeed most often."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of software testing, what is the best approach to determine if unit tests are sufficiently robust and integration tests are still necessary?\n\nA) Run integration tests more frequently than unit tests\nB) Eliminate integration tests entirely if unit tests pass consistently\nC) Monitor the frequency of legitimate failures in integration tests\nD) Always prioritize integration tests over unit tests\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C - Monitor the frequency of legitimate failures in integration tests. This approach aligns with the guidance provided in the documentation. By tracking how often integration tests genuinely fail, especially after numerous code changes, developers can assess the effectiveness of their unit tests. If integration tests rarely fail despite significant changes, it suggests that unit tests are adequately catching issues. Conversely, recent failures in integration tests indicate gaps in unit test coverage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the frequency of running tests doesn't necessarily indicate their effectiveness or necessity.

This has around 5K lines of codes.\n\nI'm now studying the microservice architecture and see how my application would/should look like if I was using it. After reading a lot of stuff, I came to two different solutions:\n\n1. In the first one, each microservice only serve one or a very few HTTP requests. This is good because if one microsevice is down, only a small part of my previous big app is down, but the rest is still working. However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. For example, each of them has more or less the same code to generate an XML template or send request to the southbound system. I know it can be overcome by using a shared library, but then each microservice needs to use the same programming language.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)\n2. Splitting the part of my app to smaller services. Here, I avoid code duplication and each service can use a different programming language, but if a single microservice is down, everything stops working. Moreover, this looks like a monolithic architecture, because I'm just separating the layer with HTTP request instead of a class/functions interface. It seems maybe a bit easier to understand and maintain, but not really giving anything more.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)\n\nI would like to have your opinion on my personal use case as I really struggle to understand how an application in a microservice world should be designed without a concrete example.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The objective of [microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) is to provide **independently deployable, loosely coupled, lean services**. This means that you shall be able to change one of the microservices however you want, and can deploy it in production without changing the others. \n\nYour scenario 1 indeed breaks the monolith down into smaller pieces. But these are not independently deployable: \n\n> However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. (...) I know it can be overcome by using a shared library,\n\nIf you change some functionality in the shared code, you no longer are sure that it's interoperable with the other service. And if shared library is changed, you're no longer sure that the other service still compiles and could be patched for an emergency issue within minutes. \n\nYour focus seems to be reliability and continuity of the microservices that you have extracted from your legacy monolith. But the common code weakens the independent continuity of services: if you have for example a vulnerability in your shared library, both services could easily be disrupted by the same hacker. Or suffer from the same nasty UB bug. \n\nThe reliability achieved with microservice is based on true independence on the functional axis. The focus is also more on scalability (see the [scale cube](https://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html)): microservices can offer horizontal duplication (i.e. several service instances for the same API \\- if one breaks down, the clones continue to work), not to speak about partitioning. \n\nFor scenario 2, you could consider implementing fault tolerance by implementing horizontal scalability, i.e. having several instances of the same service running on different nodes. It's a tough change since the services have to find each other dynamically. But then, if one of the service instance is down in the chain, the other services upstream can find another working instance. A trick for achieveing this is to move from a [synchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/rpi.html) to [asynchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html) via event queues or a message broker. \n\nIt's difficult based on the few elements you provide to confirm if approach 2 is the best one. Perhaps another [decomposition strategy](https://chrisrichardson.net/post/refactoring/2019/10/09/refactoring-to-microservices.html) could result in even lower coupling. \n\nI could for example think of this one, which combines both of your approaches: migrating your common XML generator features into a \"Service Proxy\" (the name is arbitrary: it seemed to be a relay between your new microservices and other applications), splitting the core of the monolith into [highly cohesive but loosely coupled capabilities](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/decompose-by-business-capability.html), and hiding the details of the split to the outside world behind an [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html): \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company is refactoring their monolithic application into microservices.

It promotes loose coupling and high cohesion by separating services based on business capabilities. The API gateway provides a single entry point for external requests, simplifying the client-side code. Creating a separate service for shared functionalities (like XML generation) avoids code duplication without compromising the independence of other services.\n\nOption A introduces tight coupling through shared libraries, which goes against the principle of independence in microservices. Option B resembles a layered architecture more than true microservices and doesn't address the issue of coupling between layers.

I study languages such as C, C\\+\\+, Python and Java (mainly focusing on C\\+\\+). I'm what you'd call \"young and inexperienced\" and I admit that because I can't claim otherwise. \n\nAs a student, I have many other problems besides programming. I practice programming as often as I can, and especially because my teacher gives me a lot more exercises than the rest of the class (it's a very low level), so oftentimes I spend weeks doing something else such as school projects or sports, or traveling, anything besides programming.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I love programming. I love to build functional code, to watch as a program comes alive at the push of a button, and to learn as much as I can. The thing is, I simply don't have much time for it.\n\nStraight to the question, now: does your programming knowledge decrease as time passes and you don't practice? You may ask \"how much time do you mean?\". I don't mean a specific amount of time, but for reference you could take a month\\-two or even a year as an example. \n\nBy knowledge I mean anything from syntax to language functionality.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Obviously, programming is something you learn to do, not a set of facts or information. That said, it's more like riding a bike or speaking a language. There are theories too, but it's more about putting them to practice.\n\nEven so, like anything, if you don't use it your brain will start to drop the information. Your brain is like a muscle that way. After a period of time you'll most likely remember broad concepts but not specifics about syntax and lesser\\-used functions. For example, you may want to do a `for` loop or iterate over a list and know that it's something like `while List.hasNext()` or `for item in list` or `for index, item of list` but not writing it very confidently.\n\nThe good thing is, you'll know what you want to do. You just need to look it up. So I wouldn't be too worried about it. It'll come back to you. The important thing is to learn how to solve problems with programs. All programming languages are usually capable of doing the same things, but most of the time in different ways. You might forget that Ruby or Python have comprehensions and write too many `for` loops instead, but you'll get the job done.\n\nAs for how much you'll forget or remember, I think that kind of depends on how active your mind is and how old you are. I don't think I developed a fully functional brain until I was 19\\. At that point memorizing anything for me was a snap. Everyone is different.\n\nIn sum: details always fade, the rate they fade depends on you, all languages are trying to make it easy to solve the same problems, so maybe it's more important to learn how to solve problems. :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A novice programmer who has been studying C++, Python, and Java takes a break from coding for 6 months due to other commitments.

According to the documentation, programming knowledge is similar to riding a bike or speaking a language. While broad concepts tend to be retained, specific details like syntax and lesser-used functions may fade without regular practice. The brain may \"drop\" information that isn't frequently used, but the fundamental problem-solving skills and general programming concepts are likely to remain. When returning to coding after a break, the programmer will likely remember what they want to do but may need to look up the exact syntax or specific language features.

The main predicate is *be difficult*, a predicate adjective, which uses *be* as an auxiliary, like all predicate adjectives and nouns. The other clauses are subordinate to the main clause.\n\nIf *is difficult* is the main verb phrase, what's it's subject? Well, everything else in the sentence. \n\n> (Except *it*. The *it* is a meaningless dummy, introduced by the syntactic rule of [Extraposition](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/419328/15299).)\n\n*Knowing which one to pick* is also a clause, a gerund clause with *knowing* as the gerund main verb of the clause. But every English clause needs an English subject, so whose knowing are we talking about? It's not clear. \n\n*Anybody at all, everybody, somebody, whoever you like*. It's **indefinite** who the subject is (except it does have to be a ***Who***, not a ***What***, because that's required for the subject of *know*), and since it's not there, we just don't know. But we can tell that the subject is some indefinite human, and not somebody mentioned in the conversation, so we'll just call it `Indef`, which of course, is not pronounced. Like apostrophes.\n\nSo the subject of *is difficult* is the clause\n\n* *`Indef` knowing which one to choose*\n\nand together the sentence is pronounced \n\n* *Knowing which one to choose is difficult.*\n\nThis is the sentence that's left when you unwind Extraposition. That moves a heavy subject like a gerund clause to the end of the sentence where it's easier to process, and leaves behind a dummy *It* (normally contracted to *It's* when the predicate is an adjective, as here) behind to fool us into thinking there's a subject still there so we can get to the verb fast. There are a lot of rules in English that do this, in various ways to various kinds of construction, but always in order to put heavy stuff at the end of the sentence.\n\nBut we're not done. The gerund subordinate clause *knowing which one to choose* has a subordinate clause itself: *which one to choose* is a *Wh*\\-infinitive clause, and once again its subject is missing, and once again it's indefinite.\n\n*Somebody* (indefinite) is to choose *something* (also indefinite, so it may be *somebody* instead) from a limited set of things (or people). That's the sense of *which one* instead of *what*, which could be plural and isn't limited in scope.\n\n*Wh*\\-infinitives are very restricted and have extremely peculiar syntax. The subject of *choose* is `Indef`, but the object is *which one*, moved to the front as a relative pronoun. *One* in *which one* is the indefinite singular pronoun, standing for some noun that is understood in the discourse. We don't know what (or who) is being chosen, nor by whom, but the speaker is relying on the addressee knowing what noun *one* stands for.

The \"It\" at the beginning of the sentence is a dummy subject, placed there to maintain the standard subject-verb order in English. If we undo the extraposition, the sentence would read \"Knowing which one to choose is difficult.\" Therefore, \"knowing which one to choose\" functions as the true subject of the sentence, even though it appears at the end."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/05/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/25924", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/348/"], "docs_id": 25924, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This summer I am going to give some lectures to some REU students.

There are problems with estimating the likelihood of faster runners than Mr. Bolt from record\\-setting dash times that are both obvious and subtle. Humor me by imagining this not to be the case.\n\n---\n\nUsain Bolt is the fastest human measured for the 100m dash. However, given the small number of athletes, it seems likely that the \"true\" fastest human alive is sitting on a couch somewhere and has never attempted a competitive running career.\n\nI am trying to use the fact that the difference between samples at the tails of the normal distribution become smaller and smaller. I'm using this to compute the likelihood there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt by comparing Usain to the 2nd fastest, 3rd fastest and so on.\n\nTo do this, I'm trying to compute the largest value that exists beyond \"Usain Bolt\" by taking the derivative of the normal distribution's CDF with respect to $y$, raising that to the $n$th (where $n$ is about 7,000,000,000 or the number of samples less than the \"maximum\" \\- the logic behind this is described in the [German Tank Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem) Wikipedia page which generalizes among different distributions), e.g:\n\n$\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}y f\\_{Y\\_N} (y)dy \\= \\\\lambda n \\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty} y \\\\left \\[ \\\\tfrac12\\\\left\\[1 \\+ \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left( \\\\frac{y\\-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\right ]^{n\\-1} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}}\\\\, e^{\\-\\\\frac{(y \\- \\\\mu)^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}}dy$\n\n1.

Is there a name for this sort of question outside of \"German Tank Problem for other distributions\"\n3. Is there a good way to estimate standard deviation from the extreme samples of a distribution? Finding information about the fastest 100m dashes of all time is easy, finding averages \\& variance is hard)\n\nThank you for your patience in dealing with a programmer without a background in the topic.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contrary to other answers, I'd argue that you can say something about Bolts abilities given the available data. First of all, let's narrow your question. You are asking about fastest human, but since there is a difference in the distributions of running speeds for men and woman, where the best woman runners woman seem to be slightly slower then the best man runners, we should focus on men runners. To get some data, we can look at the [best year performances on 100 run from the last 45 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres#Men). There are several things to notice about this data:\n\n* Those are the best running times, so they do not tell us about abilities of all humans, but about the *minimal* achieved speeds.\n* We assume that this data reflects sample of the best runners in the world. While it might have happened that there were even better runners that did not participate in the championships, this assumption seems to be fairly reasonable.\n\nFirst, let's discuss how **not** to analyze this data. You could notice that if we plot the running times against time, we would observe a strong linear relationship.\n\n[![Best running times vs time](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)\n\nThis could lead you to using linear regression to forecast how much better runners we could observe in the next years. This however would be a **very bad** idea, that would inevitable lead you to conclusion that in approximately two thousand years humans would be able to run 100 meters in zero seconds, and after that they would start achieving the negative running times! This is obviously absurd, as we can imagine that there is some kind of biological and physical limit of our capacities, that is unknown to us.\n\nHow could you analyze this data? First, notice that we are dealing with data about minimal values, so we should use appropriate model for such data. This leads us to considering [extreme value theory](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/158767/why-use-extreme-value-theory) models (see e.g. *An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values* book by Stuart Coles). You can assume for this data [generalized extreme value distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution) (GEV). If $Y \\= \\\\max(X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n)$ where $X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n$ are independent and identically distributed random variables, then $Y\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution. If you are interested in modeling minimas, then if $Z\\_1,Z\\_2,\\\\dots,Z\\_k$ are samples of minimas, then $\\-Z\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution for minimas. So we can fit GEV distribution to the running speeds data, what leads to pretty nice fit (see below).\n\n[![GEV distribution for running speeds](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)\n\nIf you look at at the cumulative distribution suggested by the model, you'll notice that the best running time by Usain Bolt is in the lowest $1\\\\%$ tail of the distribution. So if we stick to this data, and this toy\\-example analysis, we would conclude that the much smaller running times are unlikely (but obviously, possible). The obvious problem with this analysis is that ignores the fact that we saw year\\-to\\-year improvements of the best running times. This gets us back to the problem described in the first part of the answer, i.e. that assuming a regression model in here is risky. Another thing that could be improved is that we could use Bayesian approach and assume informative prior that would account for some out\\-of\\-data knowledge about the physiologically possible running times, that might not yet been observed (but, as far as I know, this is unknown at present moment). Finally, similar extreme value theory was already used in sports research, e.g. by Einmahl and Magnus (2008\\) in the [Records in Athletics Through Extreme\\-Value Theory](http://cdata4.uvt.nl/websitefiles/magnus/JRM082.pdf) paper.\n\nYou could protest that you didn't ask about probability of the faster running time, but about probability of observing faster runner. Unfortunately, here we can't do much since we don't know what is the probability that a runner will become a professional athlete and the recorded running times will be available for him. This doesn't happen at random and there is lots of factors contributing to the fact that some runners become professional athletes and some don't (or even that someone likes running and runs at all). For this, we would have to have a detailed population\\-wide data on runners, moreover since you are asking about the extremes of the distribution, the data would have to be very large.

Why would i need reputation points to answer a question or to create a tag? People should have the freedom to use just about any tag they want and should be able to post any answer they want.

While it shouldn't be punitive in theory, sometimes it is \\- especially when something is clearly out of scope. On main sites, question downvotes often indicate a lack of research, information, or something that simply isn't within the scope of the site. We often edit questions for new users if the issues are minor, and comment on how to make things better. Sometimes something simply isn't in scope\n\nUsing the *appropriate* tags is important because it makes it easier to find specific sorts of questions. We clear out bad tags cause its noise. As a new user, if you really *need* a tag, and can make a case for it, it'll be added. However [reputation](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/reputation \"show questions tagged 'reputation'\") [point](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/point \"show questions tagged 'point'\") [system](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/system \"show questions tagged 'system'\") [is](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/is \"show questions tagged 'is'\") [dumb](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/dumb \"show questions tagged 'dumb'\") [stupid](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/stupid \"show questions tagged 'stupid'\") [pointless](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/pointless \"show questions tagged 'pointless'\") [ridiculous](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/ridiculous \"show questions tagged 'ridiculous'\") are textbook invalid tags \\- tags are like salt. A little goes a long way, too much causes high blood pressures. [discussion](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/discussion \"show questions tagged 'discussion'\") will do nicely. This is PRECISELY why you need reputation to post tags.\n\nThe problem with your *original* question is really that its essentially a broad purchase recommendation. While there's workarounds, there's no real way to post a proper, universal answer to handle 'why is my computer slow'. we *typically* handle this on chat, but yes, it kind of sucks that you can't do that, but once again, that low barrier of entry keeps spammers and all but the most persistent trolls out. \n\nHandling a high traffic site isn't easy. We have a fairly large team of moderators, we have community mods, and people *still* do things like use tags we've asked them not to use. \n\nGetting rep isn't hard. As I pointed out, you need ONE quality answer, or a good question. I've always pointed folk at ESR's [asking questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) or you could do what I did and look around. (I've asked bad questions. It isn't the end of the world).\n\nThe reputation system lets us do a few things. Firstly, its our first line of defence against spammers. Secondly, it ensures quality to an extent. Finally, people love imaginary internet points. \n\nI'd add, that the reputation point system is *integral* to how we do things here. Get used to it, work out how we do things, and you'll get a lot more out of the site."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the reputation point system on StackExchange sites?\n\nA) To allow users to judge other users based on their contributions\nB) To prevent spam and ease users into effective site usage and moderation tasks\nC) To restrict new users from participating fully in the community\nD) To encourage users to post as many questions and answers as possible\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The reputation point system on StackExchange sites serves multiple purposes, but its primary function is to prevent spam and ease users into learning how to use the site effectively. It also gradually introduces users to metamoderation tasks as they gain more reputation. While it does allow for some judgment of user contributions, this is not its main purpose. The system is not designed to be unnecessarily restrictive, but rather to ensure quality content and protect against spam and trolls. It also doesn't aim to encourage quantity over quality in posts.

You'll need to delete your profile and log in again in order for the new StartLayout to apply to your account.\n\nThere's a fair amount of information here: [https://www.joseespitia.com/2016/06/27/customized\\-a\\-windows\\-10\\-start\\-layout/](https://www.joseespitia.com/2016/06/27/customized-a-windows-10-start-layout/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: You are an IT administrator trying to deploy a custom Start Layout via Group Policy for Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB machines. You've created the layout, modified the GPO, and applied it to a client, but the changes are not appearing for existing user profiles. What is the most likely reason for this issue and what action should you take to resolve it?\n\nA) The StartLayout file is in the wrong format. Convert it from .bin to .xml and reapply the GPO.\n\nB) The GPO is not applying correctly. Run gpresult /r to check if the policy is being applied and troubleshoot any issues.\n\nC) The changes only apply to new user profiles. Delete the existing user profile and log in again to see the new Start Layout.\n\nD) The client machine needs to be rebooted multiple times. Perform at least three reboots to ensure the changes take effect.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The custom Start Layout deployed via Group Policy typically only applies to new user profiles. Existing profiles retain their current Start Layout. To see the changes on an existing profile, you need to delete that profile and log in again, which will create a new profile with the custom Start Layout applied. This is because the Start Layout is part of the user profile configuration, which is created when a user logs in for the first time. Simply rebooting or reapplying the GPO won't change an existing profile's Start Layout."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/25", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/154767", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/68811/"], "docs_id": 154767, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do I introduce a young children's song on stage?

Then why does'nt it bounce back when it hits a water surface? or for that matter even air? The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules. Can anyone please explain this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The third law of motion:\n\n> [When one body exerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\n\n**Edit after revisit:**\n\n> The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules.\n\nThe basic misunderstanding here is in the notion of force. Acceleration for impacts will define the force, and it is best to think of the **[dp/dt definition of force.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force)** An incoming ball does not have 10 Newton's force , it has a constant velocity, so no force . **Force is generated on impact by dp/dt.** \nImpacts with solids distribute momentum and energy on the whole solid due to the cohesiveness of the electromagnetic interactions, and the total momentum energy balance can be calculated with the impact point , and dp/dt calculated to give the force of impact.\n\nImpact on air is coming in tiny scatters and tiny dp/dt. Impact on water is similar if the ball has enough energy, molecules bounce left and right with a small dp/dt slowly dissipating the energy and dispersing the momentum.\n\n**end edit** \n\nYou ask :\n\n> Then why does'nt it bounce back when it hits a water surface ?\n\nBouncing back depends on elasticity of surfaces deformations and dissipative motions of the surfaces which absorb the energy and momentum of impact , and have to be estimated for each individual case.\n\nHave you estimated the force that the steel ball exerts on the water molecules? dp/dt will transfer momentum to all the column of water it penetrates and dissipate the energy until it hits the bottom. At the surface little except ripples because the liquid is displace\\-able with little energy/momentum needs . [Look at the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF8aQHwcKN0) for a drop falling, which has the same density as the water and small energy/momentum to transfer to see how the third law is obeyed by dissipating the impulse and still a small drop bounces back.\n\nAir is a non thinker: individual molecules have very small mass with respect to the ball and pick up the tiniest fraction from the impact diminishing the motion of the ball very slightly at best. \n\nOne has to do the calculations to see that the third law is OK ? It is called a law because innumerable people have done the calculations and found that the law is validly describing data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A steel ball is dropped from the same height onto four different surfaces: a solid iron plate, a pool of water, a cushion of air, and a trampoline. Which statement best explains the different bouncing behaviors observed, while still adhering to Newton's Third Law of Motion?\n\nA) Newton's Third Law doesn't apply to liquids and gases, only to solid surfaces.\n\nB) The ball exerts less force on water and air molecules compared to solid surfaces, resulting in less bounce.\n\nC) The ball exerts equal force on all surfaces, but the way the force is distributed and dissipated differs, affecting the bounce.\n\nD) The ball experiences more air resistance when falling onto water and air, reducing its impact force.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Newton's Third Law of Motion applies in all cases, but the key difference lies in how the force is distributed and dissipated in different materials. On a solid iron surface, the force is quickly distributed throughout the material due to strong electromagnetic interactions, resulting in an elastic collision and a visible bounce. In water, the force is dissipated by displacing many water molecules, creating ripples and absorbing energy. In air, the force is distributed among many low-mass molecules, resulting in minimal resistance. The trampoline, while solid, is designed to distribute and return the force, resulting in a high bounce. In all cases, the ball exerts a force, and an equal opposite force is exerted back, but the macroscopic effects vary due to the properties of the materials involved."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/26", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/137532", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/57135/"], "docs_id": 137532, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Arkham Origins, the Environment Analysis hasn't been doing much.

You can always remove that part, in order to remove them manually after verifying your compressed files.\n\nIt is important that you're in relative folder to your `dir1/`, so all paths returned by `find` are relative to the current folder, so you don't have to [convert absolute paths into relative](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2564634/55075) (this still can be done by `realpath`, e.g. `realpath --relative-to=$absolute $current`, but it will just overcomplicate the above command).\n\nOn macOS, to use `-r` argument for `xargs`, you need to install GNU `xargs` (`brew install xargs`) and use `gxargs` command instead.

The documentation clarifies that it's misleading to say comparative degree is only used for comparing two items. Instead, comparative degree can be used to compare two or more items, as long as the comparison involves at least two distinct entities or groups. This is supported by the example \"Jill's older than Pedro and Nora,\" which compares one person to two others using comparative degree. The key is that there are at least two distinct entities or groups being compared, not that there are exactly two items total. Option A is too restrictive, B is incorrect because it's not limited to groups, and D is false because comparative and superlative degrees have distinct uses."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/09", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503576", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/193802/"], "docs_id": 503576, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not able to reproduce the following image with tikz:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqReA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqReA.png)\n\nI am able to draw each single tree, but I have no idea how to combine them to get the image shown above. \n\nHow do you arrange them? \nHow do you add arrows and texts?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBelow you find the code that I wrote for the tree of the first two line of the image.\n\nPS: is forest the right package to do this?\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}\n\\usepackage[linguistics]{forest}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{forest}\n  [\n    4 \n    [3\n        [2]\n        [1]\n    ]\n    [5\n        [6]\n    ]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    4 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [1]\n        ]\n        [5\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    5 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [1]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    1 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    1 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [4\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\n\\begin{forest}\n    [\n    4 \n        [3\n            [2]\n            [5]\n        ]\n        [1\n            [6]\n        ]\n    ]\n\\end{forest}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using Ti*K*z `pic` definition and `matrix` library.

Scikit\\-learn has the [`TimeSeriesSplit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) functionality for this.\n\nThe `shuffle` parameter is needed to prevent non\\-random assignment to to train and test set. With `shuffle=True` you split the data randomly. For example, say that you have balanced binary classification data and it is ordered by labels. If you split it in 80:20 proportions to train and test, your test data would contain *only* the labels from one class. Random shuffling prevents this.\n\nIf random shuffling would break your data, this is a good argument for not splitting randomly to train and test. In such cases, you would use splits on time, or clustered splits (say you have data on education, so you sample whole schools to train and test, rather than individual students).\n\nWhen should you use `shuffle=False`? TL;DR never.\n\n* Your data was randomly sampled or was already shuffled. But shuffling one more time wouldn't hurt you. I remember seeing multiple datasets that were supposed to be randomly shuffled but weren't.\n* Your dataset is huge, so shuffling makes the whole pipeline a little bit slower. If that is the case, you probably don't want to use scikit\\-learn pipelines for preprocessing as well. If you use instead something else that scales better, still you need to make sure that it shuffles the data.\n* You don't want to split randomly and your data is already arranged in the way how you want to split it, for example, you have data collected during the 2010\\-2020 period and you want to split in 80:20 proportions with years 2010\\-2018 in train set and 2019\\-2020 in test set. Here it makes sense, but you would probably would like to use the `TimeSeriesSplit` functionality instead or write the code by hand to have greater control on what you are doing. For example, if you want to split by years, you probably don't want by accident few days of one year to land in other set than the rest of the year\\-\\-so you would rather do the split manually."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a time series dataset ordered by dates, which of the following approaches is most appropriate for splitting the data into training and test sets?\n\nA) Use train_test_split with shuffle=True to ensure random assignment\nB) Use train_test_split with shuffle=False to maintain the temporal order\nC) Use TimeSeriesSplit to create time-based folds for cross-validation\nD) Manually split the data by selecting specific date ranges for train and test sets\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: For time series data, it's crucial to maintain the temporal order and avoid randomly shuffling the data. Option A would break the time-dependent structure of the data. Option B, while maintaining order, doesn't account for the specific needs of time series data. Option C, using TimeSeriesSplit, is designed specifically for time series data, allowing for proper handling of temporal dependencies and creating multiple train-test splits that respect the time order. Option D is a valid approach but less flexible than TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation purposes.

The documentation describes a hybrid approach that effectively balances performance and interactivity:\n\n1. WMS layers are used for general visualization at lower zoom levels, which is faster for rendering large datasets.\n2. A zoom event listener is registered to detect when the user reaches a predefined zoom level.\n3. At higher zoom levels, the system switches to WFS layers with a BBOX (bounding box) strategy. This allows for more detailed interaction with a smaller subset of features.\n\nThis approach addresses the performance issues of loading all features via WFS at once, while still allowing for detailed interaction when needed. It's more efficient than option A (which lacks detailed feature interaction), more practical than C (which doesn't solve the initial performance problem), and more interactive than D (which would lose vector data benefits)."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/17", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/79919", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3277/"], "docs_id": 79919, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'd like to generate a multivariate continuous data which is **globular** cloud, like multivariate standard normal data is, but which is more **platykurtic** than normal data.\n\nThere are many ways to get platykurtic data (e.g. from beta distribution) but the more platykurtic they are the more they are rectangular shape in multivariate space.

Given a point in an $n$\\-dimensional cloud of iid standard normals, shrink it radially a chosen proportion of the way to the corresponding fractile of a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball.\n\nFor iid standard normals in $n$ dimensions, the distance from the origin has a $\\\\chi\\_n$ distribution. Let $F\\_n(d)$ denote its cdf. For a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball, the cdf of the distance from the origin is $d^n$, and the inverse cdf is $p^{1/n}$. So multiply each point's coordinate vector by $1 \\+ \\\\alpha(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}/d \\- 1\\)$, where $\\\\alpha$ is the chosen proportion and $d$ is the observed distance of the point from the origin.\n\nEDIT \\-\\- A minor improvement, that makes the results easier to interpret: Scale the ball so that the mean square distance of the points from the origin is the same as the normal, $n$. The corresponding multiplier on the vector of normals is $1 \\+ \\\\alpha\\\\,(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}\\\\sqrt{n\\+2}\\\\,/d \\- 1\\)$.\n\nI have no proof that the marginal distribution is unimodal, but I have looked at histograms of marginal distributions with $\\\\alpha \\= 0, .05, \\\\ldots, 1$ for $n \\= 1, \\\\ldots, 10$, and they all look as they should, varying smoothly from $\\\\mathrm{N}(0,1\\)$ to a shifted and scaled $\\\\mathrm{Beta}(\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2},\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2})$. For $n \\= 2$ I have also looked at scatter plots with the same set of $\\\\alpha$\\-values, and they too look as they should, with no \"bald spot\" in the middle.\n\nHere is Mathematica code whose results are organized to facilitate exploring the effect of $\\\\alpha$.\n\n```\n{m, n} = { sample size, # of dimensions };\nz = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {m, n}];\ny = z * With[{dd = Total[z^2, {2}]},\n    CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n], dd]^(1/n) * Sqrt[(n + 2)/dd]];\n\n```\n\nThen `x = alpha*y + (1-alpha)*z` will be a matrix that varies smoothly with `alpha` between iid normal (`alpha = 0`; pure `z`) and a uniform n\\-ball (`alpha = 1`; pure `y`). Here are scatter plots of 5000 points in 2 dimensions for `alpha = {0, .25, .50, .75, 1}`.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VSOTd.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An analyst wants to generate multivariate continuous data that is globular like standard normal data, but more platykurtic.

According to the Apple Support Document referenced in the top answer, iPhoto can sometimes detect faces where they don't exist, especially in images with certain patterns or textures.

Sometimes we also use the `--opt --skip-lock-tables` option.\n* When the db was smaller 2 years ago this wasn't a problem since it ran fast, but now that the db is large and the dump takes quite some time to finish, users experience slowness and downtime during the backup window.\n\nWhat can I do to make my database backups better, faster, less impactful on the website users while still maintaining a good, usable backup?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think this is more related to <http://dba.stackexchange.com> and has already been answered there quite often.\n\nTake a look:\n\n* [How can I optimize a mysqldump of a large database?](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/20/how-can-i-optimize-a-mysqldump-of-a-large-database)\n* [How can I backup a large SQL Server database without impacting performance?](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/30692/how-can-i-backup-a-large-sql-server-database-without-impacting-performance)\n* [Best practices for backing up a MySQL DB](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/50664/best-practices-for-backing-up-a-mysql-db/51014#51014)\n\nFor a quick and easy solution where you could stick to `mysqldump` you could also try splitting your dump down to specific tables to reduce the size. Tables that don't change much or don't contain critical data don't have to be backed up that frequently: [https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/9306/how\\-do\\-you\\-mysqldump\\-specific\\-tables](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/9306/how-do-you-mysqldump-specific-tables)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A large e-commerce site using Magento is experiencing performance issues during database backups. The current backup method uses mysqldump, but as the database has grown to 5GB, users are experiencing slowness during the backup window. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in minimizing impact on website users while maintaining a usable backup?\n\nA) Use the --opt --skip-lock-tables option with mysqldump to avoid locking tables during the backup process.\n\nB) Implement a master/slave setup for the MySQL instance and perform backups on the slave to avoid impacting the live site.\n\nC) Split the backup process by dumping specific tables at different intervals based on their update frequency and criticality.\n\nD) Increase the server resources dedicated to the MySQL instance to handle the backup process more efficiently.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most effective approach for this scenario. Splitting the backup process by dumping specific tables at different intervals allows for a more targeted and efficient backup strategy. This method addresses several key points:\n\n1. It reduces the overall size and time of each backup operation, minimizing the impact on live site performance.\n2. Critical and frequently updated tables can be backed up more often, while static or less important tables can be backed up less frequently.\n3. This approach maintains data integrity by ensuring all tables are still backed up, just on different schedules.\n4. It doesn't require significant changes to the existing infrastructure or backup method.\n\nOption A, while potentially reducing some impact, doesn't address the core issue of the large backup size and duration.\n\nOption B could be effective but requires a more complex setup and doesn't directly address the backup size issue.\n\nOption D might help but doesn't solve the fundamental problem and could be costly without guaranteeing a solution.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the suggestion in the documentation to split dumps into specific tables, which is described as a \"quick and easy solution\" that allows continued use of mysqldump while addressing the performance impact."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/18", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/2728", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/138/"], "docs_id": 2728, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In fallout 3 my first time playing it I was suppose to find information about my father at MegaTon.
