Promising approach is to build up a text published parameter and use this as a source for the `DestDataset_...` published parameter.\n\nWhere the project name is no problem to achieve, I am not able to access the actual date like described in the above way in creating published parameters.

I.e. if a principal component with high variance explanation is found, this is interpreted, that there is a common cause for all the variables that load onto this common factor. However, in a simulation, I find that other factors may be recovered, which puts some doubt on this causal interpretation. Here is the code I use for my simulation:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nN <- 10000\n\nset.seed(298471979)\n\n# Random variance not explained by any of the factors\nv.error <- 0.01\n# Remaining variance\nv.g <- (1-v.error) / 2\n\n# LATENT variables that should be recovered statistically\ng1 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\ng2 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\ng3 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\n\n# Observed data caused by latent variables\ny1 <- g1 + g2 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\ny2 <- g2 + g3 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\ny3 <- g1 + g3 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\n\nY <- cbind(y1,y2,y3)\n\npca <- prcomp(Y, scale. = T, center = T)\n\n```\n\nNow under the causal interpretation of the PCA results, I would expect my PCA to recover $g\\_1$, $g\\_2$, and $g\\_3$. However, the actual rotation matrix I get is:\n\n```\nRotation (n x k) = (3 x 3):\n         PC1          PC2        PC3\ny1 0.5785666 -0.002218839  0.8156321\ny2 0.5767353  0.708224186 -0.4071792\ny3 0.5767469 -0.705984121 -0.4110346\n\n```\n\nWhich indicates a common underlying cause for $y\\_1$, $y\\_2$, and $y\\_3$ (which is not what I actually generated). My first guess, was that the $g\\_i$ may not be perfectly uncorrelated (in fact they are not) and hence the PCA is trying to account for this slight correlation. However, a theoretical analysis showed that I would get a similar rotation matrix even for perfectly uncorrelated $g\\_i$.\n\nIn fact, if I do the same thing theoretical and define\n\n$y\\_1\\=g\\_1\\+g\\_2\\+\\\\epsilon\\_1$ with $\\\\epsilon\\_1 \\\\sim N(0,\\\\sigma^2\\)$ \n\nand similar for $y\\_2$ and $y\\_3$, I find that if I try to recover $g\\_1$ as \n\n$g'\\_1\\=(y\\_1\\-y\\_2\\+y\\_3\\)/2$ \n\nand $g\\_2$ as \n\n$g'\\_2\\=(y\\_1\\+y\\_2\\-y\\_3\\)/2$ \n\nthen I have a covariance between $g'\\_1$ and $g'\\_2$ that can be calculated to be \n\n$Cov\\[g'\\_1,g'\\_2]\\=\\\\sigma^2/4\\.$\n\nSo the recovered variables are in fact not orthogonal. However, if I manually do the eigenvalue computation, I get the eigenvector structure of\n\n$\\\\left\\\\{\\\\pmatrix{1\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\},\\\\pmatrix{0\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\-1\\\\\\\\},\\\\pmatrix{1\\\\\\\\\\-1/2\\\\\\\\\\-1/2\\\\\\\\}\\\\right\\\\}$\n\nand this closely matches the rotation matrix of the PCA.\n\nSo when does this causal interpretation of a PCA actually make sense? Or is this interpretation always incorrect, similar to mixing up correlation and causation? Also on a related note, are there exact conditions when a PCA might be able to find the original factors? \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSorry for not clearly distinguishing between \"factors\" and \"components\". Since both are often treated very similarly, I also tend to mix them up from time to time. My question, however, can partially be related to both. \n\nThe situation I am trying to describe is where there are three (unobservable) latent variable $g\\_1$, $g\\_2$, $g\\_3$. However, these are not observable independenlty, but only as their combinations $y\\_1$, $y\\_2$, and $y\\_3$. Since the $y\\_i$ result from the $g\\_i$ it should be possible to reconstruct those. \n\nI am aware, that it is possible to use a PCA to decorrelate data (by multiplying with the rotation matrix) and then reconstruct the original (observable) data back from the decorrelated variables (by multiplying with the transposed rotation matrix). But this is not what I am after, I would like to retrieve the latent unobservable variables.\n\nA true factor analysis (using `factanal`), in this case, produces very similar results:\n\n```\nLoadings:\n   Factor1\ny1 0.710  \ny2 0.703  \ny3 0.703 \n\n```\n\nwhich almost matches the first component I found using a PCA. Also `factanal` wont let me retrieve more than one factor from $Y$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the absence of any specific clarifying context, \"performance\" is just a synonym for \"quality.\"\n\nThe sentence \"I want a model that performs better\" is essentially the same as the sentence \"I want a higher\\-quality model.\" Readers understand that the speaker is not satisfied with how well the model solves some particular problem, but the reader does not know, precisely, what about the model is dissatisfactory. Does the model predict too many false positives? Or false negatives? Does it predict incorrect classes for images that have a tilted horizon, or are taken on cloudy days? Understanding what about the model needs improvement would require further, specific elaboration.\n\nLikewise, if someone says that Adam has better performance than another optimizer, they're making a claim that Adam does better at some task, which they would have to specify for it to be possible to assess the truthfulness of the claim. One way to assesses performance of an optimizer is how many iterations it takes to reach some neighborhood around a minimum; another, which is particular to machine learning classifiers, is how well the solutions obtained by an optimizer generalize to out\\-of\\-sample data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of machine learning and optimization, what does \"better performance\" most likely refer to?\n\nA) The model's ability to run faster on a given hardware setup\nB) The optimizer's efficiency in reaching a solution within a certain number of iterations\nC) The aesthetic quality of the model's code implementation\nD) The model's capacity to handle larger datasets\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The text emphasizes that \"performance\" is generally synonymous with \"quality\" in the absence of specific context. In machine learning and optimization, one way to assess an optimizer's performance is \"how many iterations it takes to reach some neighborhood around a minimum.\" This directly corresponds to option B, which refers to the optimizer's efficiency in reaching a solution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while computational speed can be a factor, it's not typically the primary meaning of \"performance\" in this context. Option C is irrelevant to the model's actual functioning or results. Option D, while potentially related to performance in some contexts, is not specifically mentioned in the given text and is less directly tied to the concept of optimization performance discussed."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/23", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/607275", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/227525/"], "docs_id": 607275, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My server is using Centos 6\\.5\nI updated from Plesk 11\\.5 to 12 last week and postfix to 2\\.8\\.17\\.\nSince then, all mails sent using the sendmail binary (notifications, mail forwards...) are being rejected with a wrong HELO hostname: localhost.\nIt seems that sendmail is using locahost as a HELO tag which is not accepted.\n\nThank you in advance for your help\n\nHere is the following error:\n\n```\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 plesk sendmail[29817]: handlers_stderr: SKIP\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 plesk sendmail[29817]: SKIP during call 'check-quota' handler\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 postfix/pickup[29480]: B94BC6AA20A6: uid=0 from=<root@curuba.fr>\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 postfix/cleanup[29507]: B94BC6AA20A6: message-id=<20140623122320.B94BC6AA20A6@ns395167.ip-176-31-117.eu>\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 greylisting filter[29824]: Starting greylisting filter...\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 greylisting filter[29824]: Wrong HELO hostname: localhost\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 /usr/lib64/plesk-9.0/psa-pc-remote[29457]: handlers_stderr: REJECT\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 /usr/lib64/plesk-9.0/psa-pc-remote[29457]: REJECT during call 'grey' handler\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 /usr/lib64/plesk-9.0/psa-pc-remote[29457]: Message aborted.\nJun 23 14:23:20 ns395167 postfix/cleanup[29507]: B94BC6AA20A6: milter-reject: DATA from localhost[127.0.0.1]: 5.7.1 Command rejected;

Here the snippet from [this page](http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html#non-smtp-milters) from official documentation.\n\n> There's one small complication when using Milter applications for non\\-SMTP mail: there is no SMTP session. To keep Milter applications happy, **the Postfix cleanup(8\\) server actually has to simulate the SMTP client** CONNECT and DISCONNECT events, and the SMTP client EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and DATA commands.\n> \n> \n> When new mail arrives via the sendmail(1\\) command line, the Postfix cleanup(8\\) server pretends that **the mail arrives with ESMTP from \"localhost\" with IP address \"127\\.0\\.0\\.1\"**. The result is very similar to what happens with command line submissions in Sendmail version 8\\.12 and later, although Sendmail uses a different mechanism to achieve this result.\n\nLooking in the logs and output of `postconf -n`, its clear that the process who reject it was milter application running via inet:127\\.0\\.0\\.1:12768\\. It's `psa-pc-remote` milter provided by Plesk.\n\nWhile I don't have any experience with Plesk, some workaround is turn off that milter for **non\\_smtpd** only. Well, I don't know this is bad or good advice because I don't know what `psa-pc-remote` do to your email. Another way, you can look some setting in Plesk to turn off this kind of rejection."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting an issue where emails sent using the sendmail binary are being rejected with a wrong HELO hostname of \"localhost\" after upgrading Plesk and postfix.

This behavior is actually expected for postfix when processing non-SMTP mail (such as those sent via the sendmail binary). According to the postfix documentation, for non-SMTP mail, the postfix cleanup server simulates SMTP events and pretends that the mail arrives with ESMTP from \"localhost\" with IP address \"127.0.0.1\". This is done to keep Milter applications happy, as they expect SMTP session data.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the logs show the system hostname is correctly set to ns395167.ip-176-31-117.eu.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the postconf output shows myhostname is correctly set to ns395167.ip-176-31-117.eu.\n\nAnswer D is partially true in that the greylisting filter is rejecting the hostname, but this is not due to misconfiguration. It's rejecting \"localhost\" because that's what postfix is simulating for non-SMTP mail.\n\nThe real issue here is likely related to the Plesk-provided milter (psa-pc-remote) rejecting this simulated localhost connection, which is actually normal postfix behavior for non-SMTP mail."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/23", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/314678", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/193552/"], "docs_id": 314678, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've lately become hooked into building computers in Minecraft and today I decided to build a giant hard drive.

'*Reversing the effect ... by turning around*' simply means that a left\\-eyed fish lying on its right side should see exactly the same thing as a right\\-eyed fish lying on its left side.\n\n![Sketch of flatfish](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lzS8f.png)\n\nOn the left is a flatfish with eyes on the left side, lying on its right side on the seabed.

It does not define business process; only visualize business data. The data is represented as components (entities) that are linked with each other by relationships that express the dependencies and requirements between them, such as: one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building. Entities may have various properties (attributes) that characterize them. Diagrams created to represent these entities, attributes, and relationships graphically are called entity\u2013relationship diagrams.\n> \n> \n> An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In the case of a relational database, which stores data in tables, every row of each table represents one instance of an entity. Some data fields in these tables point to indexes in other tables; such pointers are the physical implementation of the relationships.\n\nAnd more specifically\n\n> Crow's foot notation is used in Barker's Notation, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) and information engineering. Crow's foot diagrams represent entities as boxes, and relationships as lines between the boxes. Different shapes at the ends of these lines represent the cardinality of the relationship.\n\nObject diagrams are a slightly different from ER diagrams.\n\n> In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object diagram focuses on some particular set of objects and attributes, and the links between these instances. A correlated set of object diagrams provides insight into how an arbitrary view of a system is expected to evolve over time. In early UML specifications the object diagram is described as:\n> \n> \n> \n> > \"An object diagram is a graph of instances, including objects and data values. A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time. The use of object diagrams is fairly limited, namely to show examples of data structure.\"\n> >  The latest UML 2\\.5 specification does not explicitly define object diagrams, but provides a notation for instances of classifiers.\n> \n> \n> Object diagrams and class diagrams are closely related and use almost identical notation. Both diagrams are meant to visualize static structure of a system. While class diagrams show classes, object diagrams display instances of classes (objects). Object diagrams are more concrete than class diagrams. They are often used to provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams. Only aspects of current interest in a model are typically shown on an object diagram.\n> \n> \n> ### Usage\n> \n> \n> If you are using a UML modeling tool, you will typically draw object diagrams using some other diagram type, such as on a class diagram. An object instance may be called an instance specification or just an instance. A link between instances is generally referred to as a link.

Worker takes a job from Queue and runs calculations\n 3. After a successful calculations the worker saves results in the shared DB \n- \n 1. External service B requests every N seconds service A to take the data calculated in the W by job id\n 2. Service A observes shared DB and returns the data once the worker is finished (status=Done for a particular job)\n\n```\n\n[![old way architecture](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vz4QW.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vz4QW.png)\n\n**We have decided to rewrite the Python service A into Node.JS (NestJS) and improve the current implementation in any way.** As you may have noticed, there's line `External service B requests every N seconds`. We want to get rid of this pattern as well and use something more efficient and performant for this case.\n\n### 1\\. Concept using Kafka\n\nThe first idea is to use some message queue service like Kafka:\n\n[![concept-using-kafka](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ADwp.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ADwp.png)\n\nI like this approach since we have a separated worker which only executes some calculations (jobs) and Kafka which plays the role of distributing messages between services. This approach could also get rid of interval/polling requests for taking an actual data.\n\nAt the same time it has several possible drawbacks:\n\n* Imagine the Worker runs only on single thread and, accordingly, can perform one job at a time. How to handle multiple messages at the same time from Kafka in the worker if there is already running job? Do we need to create a RAM Queue or Kafka can handle these cases?\n* What if Kafka or service that consumes messages would suddenly shutdown, will the transmitted data be lost?\n* Maybe use another appropriate MQ such as RabbitMQ instead of Kafka?\n\n### 2\\. Concept using PG Queue ... with Kafka\n\nSince we are rewriting the service from scratch using a new technology, we can improve the original approach by replacing the interval requests for getting the data with Kafka. So, the interaction scheme will look like this:\n\n```\n 1. External service B consumes all messages from a particular topic\n 2. Service A observes DB and sends data to the topic once the worker is finished (status=Done on the job)\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThe approach using a shared database and a Postgres queue seems to me more safe and controllable, but at the same time the approach using Kafka as a common message broker seems more modern and sustainable.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Maybe there's better approach to this problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your organization has an expectation that you participate in non\\-project work, then you need to account for this time during your Sprint Planning.

And once in a while, OOM\\-killer kills some process:\n\n```\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: active_anon:79945387 inactive_anon:3660742 isolated_anon:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: active_file:252 inactive_file:0 isolated_file:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: unevictable:0 dirty:2 writeback:0 unstable:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: free:12513746 slab_reclaimable:5001 slab_unreclaimable:1759785\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: mapped:213 shmem:41 pagetables:188243 bounce:0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA free:15728kB min:0kB low:0kB high:0kB active_anon:0kB inactive_anon:0kB active_file:0kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:15332kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:0kB shmem:0kB slab_reclaimable:0kB slab_unreclaimable:0kB kernel_stack:0kB pagetables:0kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? yes\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 2965 193855 193855\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA32 free:431968kB min:688kB low:860kB high:1032kB active_anon:0kB inactive_anon:0kB active_file:0kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:3037072kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:0kB shmem:0kB slab_reclaimable:0kB slab_unreclaimable:0kB kernel_stack:0kB pagetables:0kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? yes\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 190890 190890\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 Normal free:6593828kB min:44356kB low:55444kB high:66532kB active_anon:178841380kB inactive_anon:7783292kB active_file:540kB inactive_file:0kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:195471360kB mlocked:0kB dirty:8kB writeback:0kB mapped:312kB shmem:48kB slab_reclaimable:11136kB slab_unreclaimable:1959664kB kernel_stack:5104kB pagetables:397332kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0 0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 1 Normal free:43013460kB min:45060kB low:56324kB high:67588kB active_anon:140940168kB inactive_anon:6859676kB active_file:468kB inactive_file:56kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB present:198574076kB mlocked:0kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB mapped:540kB shmem:116kB slab_reclaimable:8868kB slab_unreclaimable:5079476kB kernel_stack:2856kB pagetables:355640kB unstable:0kB bounce:0kB writeback_tmp:0kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0 0\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA: 2*4kB 1*8kB 2*16kB 2*32kB 2*64kB 1*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 1*1024kB 1*2048kB 3*4096kB = 15728kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 DMA32: 10*4kB 11*8kB 12*16kB 13*32kB 12*64kB 5*128kB 7*256kB 10*512kB 9*1024kB 6*2048kB 98*4096kB = 431968kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 0 Normal: 1648026*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 6592104kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Node 1 Normal: 8390977*4kB 1181188*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 43013412kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: 49429 total pagecache pages\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: 48929 pages in swap cache\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Swap cache stats: add 2688331, delete 2639402, find 16219898/16530111\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Free swap  = 3264kB\nNov 20 12:42:42 wv2-f302 kernel: Total swap = 512248kB\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 100663294 pages RAM\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 1446311 pages reserved\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 10374115 pages shared\nNov 20 12:42:44 wv2-f302 kernel: 84534113 pages non-shared\n\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ pid ]   uid  tgid total_vm      rss cpu oom_adj oom_score_adj name\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 3878]     0  3878 32042399 31569413  10       0             0 qemu_wl52\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 4321]     0  4321 32092081 31599762  20       0             0 qemu_wl51\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: [ 4394]     0  4394 32106979 31575717  15       0             0 qemu_wl50\n...\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: Out of memory: Kill process 3878 (qemu_wl52) score 318 or sacrifice child\nOct 27 14:24:43 wv2-f302 kernel: Killed process 3878, UID 0, (qemu_wl52) total-vm:128169596kB, anon-rss:126277476kB, file-rss:176kB\n\n```\n\nComplete dump: <http://evilcigi.eu/msg/msg.txt>\n\nThen i start the killed guest and from that moment, everything is OK, for a few days..

Or is there something I'm missing?\n\nOne thing comes to my mind, that host puts all free memory in buffers and cache and then suffers from memory shortage (invokes OOM\\-killer)? But that, i think, shouldnt happen, right? Also, that doesnt explain the behavior before the killing.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n---\n\nso today the problem occurs again, here is the content of /proc/meminfo: \n\n```\nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:         9720268 kB\nBuffers:        53354000 kB\nCached:            22196 kB\nSwapCached:       343964 kB\nActive:         331872796 kB\nInactive:       41283992 kB\nActive(anon):   305458432 kB\nInactive(anon): 14322324 kB\nActive(file):   26414364 kB\nInactive(file): 26961668 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:              0 kB\nDirty:                48 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      319438656 kB\nMapped:             8536 kB\nShmem:               164 kB\nSlab:            9052784 kB\nSReclaimable:    2014752 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7038032 kB\nKernelStack:        8064 kB\nPageTables:       650892 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   383832752 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31502336 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nIt seems that all the \"free\" memory is spent in buffers.\n\n---\n\nAfter hints from @Matthew Ife about memory fragmentation, I have compacted the memory and also dropped the caches (to free up 60 GBs in buffers) on Host, with those commands:\n\n```\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\necho 1 >/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory\n\n```\n\nHere is what memory fragmentation looks like now:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 2398537 469407 144288  97224  58276  24155   8153   3141   1299    451     75 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 9182926 2727543 648104  81843   7915   1267    244     67      3      1      0\n\n```\n\n---\n\nupdate 2014/11/25 \\- server is overloaded again:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 4374385  85408      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 1830850 261703    460     14      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \n\n# cat /proc/meminfo \nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:        28038892 kB\nBuffers:        49126656 kB\nCached:            19088 kB\nSwapCached:       303624 kB\nActive:         305426204 kB\nInactive:       49729776 kB\nActive(anon):   292040988 kB\nInactive(anon): 13969376 kB\nActive(file):   13385216 kB\nInactive(file): 35760400 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:             20 kB\nDirty:                28 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      305706632 kB\nMapped:             9324 kB\nShmem:               124 kB\nSlab:            8616228 kB\nSReclaimable:    1580736 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7035492 kB\nKernelStack:        8200 kB\nPageTables:       702268 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   384014048 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31670272 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nand in syslog are some page allocation failures:\n\n```\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: qemu_wl50: page allocation failure. order:4, mode:0x20\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Pid: 4444, comm: qemu_wl50 Not tainted 2.6.32-431.17.1.el6.x86_64 #1\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Call Trace:\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: <IRQ>  [<ffffffff8112f64a>] ?

Put in a dual pole dual throw relay and have it emulate a 4 way switch. Also add a [current sensor](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008ASXVL4) so I can tell if the light is on or off (secondary goal). All the lighting circuit wiring is in the attic (1 story house) so I'll splice the box in above. Due to the nature of the way a [4 way switch works](http://users.wfu.edu/matthews/misc/switches/4WayAnimation.html) this should be passive and allow for simple switches to be used unlike what I saw here [Any obvious problems with this DIY home automation?](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/28906/any-obvious-problems-with-this-diy-home-automation). Also means that if the automation logic is removed the switches will work as normal. I can put these in now and worry about hardware/software later; having all control and sensor wires run back to a central location.\n\nQuestion is what relay do I need to get, and how would I wire it up in order to accomplish this task? I was thinking of using 24vac coils because they are very common (in homes) but that makes it harder to hook up to a logic board as I'll need another relay to convert DC to AC for the coil on the 120v (USA) relay.\n\nPretty sure I would need a DTDP (or 2x STDP) latching relay but I'm not sure which one to get and how to wire it up so that the circuits cross like X or goes parallel like \\= when given a switch signal. \n\nMaking all switches be 3 way wouldn't be that hard to do in this house; so I could do this for every light switch without too much hassle.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can purchase and utilize a common DPDT type relay (Double Pole / Double Throw) to create a cross over switch. It is pretty easy to understand from the following relay diagram:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kpcp7.png)\n\nYou connect one circuit to the two NC (normally closed) terminals of the relay. The other circuit connects to the two COM (common) terminals. Then you add two additional wires which cross connect the two NC terminals to the opposite NO (normally open) terminals. \n\nThe coil of course is driven with the control voltage that you have selected. The simplest control voltage to use would be \\+12V DC. There are plenty of relays available that have 12V DC coils and your remote automation control can use simple transistors to drive the relay coils. \n\nIf you go ahead and use 24V AC for the relay coils then you would have to use an additional relay for each switch control to translate the switching from the AC realm to the low voltage DC realm. (There are circuit components available that can switch the 24VAC but it gets more complex than necessary for an application where \\+12V DC can be easily used instead. And then you can derive the needed \\+12V DC from a re\\-purposed computer power supply. \n\nA major concern when building any type of system such as this, where you bring remote control wiring into the mains wiring boxes of your house, is safety and isolation. Only relays rated properly should be used and you would bear the safety liability associated with stringing the control wires around your house."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a home automation system using relays to control lights on a 3-way switch circuit.

Here's why:\n\n1. The DPDT configuration allows for the creation of a crossover switch, which is necessary to emulate a 4-way switch in the 3-way switch circuit.\n\n2. Using a 12VDC coil simplifies the control circuitry. It can be easily driven by transistors from a low-voltage DC control system, eliminating the need for additional AC-to-DC conversion relays.\n\n3. 12VDC is safer and easier to work with than 24VAC or 120VAC for control circuits in a residential setting.\n\n4. A single DPDT relay is more compact and efficient than using two separate SPDT relays.\n\n5. 12VDC can be easily sourced from a repurposed computer power supply, making it a cost-effective solution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an SPST relay cannot create the necessary crossover switching.

Enabling jumbo frames and setting the MTU to 9000 on both the initiator and target can significantly improve throughput for large data transfers. Moving iSCSI traffic to a separate VLAN isolates it from other network traffic, reducing congestion and potential interference. These actions directly address network optimization, which is often the primary limiting factor in iSCSI performance.\n\nOption B focuses on hardware upgrades that may not necessarily address the core issue if the network is not properly configured.\n\nOption C introduces QoS, which can help but is not as directly impactful as the measures in option A, and upgrading the CPU is unlikely to be the limiting factor in storage performance.\n\nOption D suggests switching to Fibre Channel, which, while potentially faster, is a more drastic change and may not be necessary if iSCSI is properly optimized.

How is this structure extracted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"circular\" I understand that the distribution is concentrated on a circular region, as in this contour plot of a pdf.\n\n![Contour plot of a circular distribution](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qGDE6.png)\n\nIf such a structure exists, even partially, a natural way to identify and measure it is to **average the distribution circularly around its center**. (Intuitively, this means that for each possible radius $r$ we should spread the probability of being at distance $r$ from the center equally around in all directions.) Denoting the variables as $(X,Y)$, the center must be located at the point of first moments $(\\\\mu\\_X, \\\\mu\\_Y)$. To do the averaging it is convenient to define the radial distribution function\n\n$$F(\\\\rho) \\= \\\\Pr\\[(X\\-\\\\mu\\_X)^2 \\+ (Y\\-\\\\mu\\_Y)^2 \\\\le \\\\rho^2], \\\\rho \\\\ge 0;$$\n$$F(\\\\rho) \\= 0, \\\\rho \\\\lt 0\\.$$\n\nThis captures the total probability of lying between distance $0$ and $\\\\rho$ of the center. To spread it out in all directions, let $R$ be a random variable with cdf $F$ and $\\\\Theta$ be a uniform random variable on $\\[0, 2\\\\pi]$ independent of $R$. The bivariate random variable $(\\\\Xi, H) \\= (R\\\\cos(\\\\Theta) \\+ \\\\mu\\_X, R\\\\sin(\\\\Theta)\\+\\\\mu\\_Y)$ is the *circular average* of $(X,Y)$. (This does the job our intuition demands of a \"circular average\" because (a) it has the correct radial distribution, namely $F$, by construction, and (b) all directions from the center ($\\\\Theta$) are equally probable.)\n\nAt this point you have many choices: all that remains is to compare the distribution of $(X,Y)$ to that of $(\\\\Xi, H)$. Possibilities include an [$L^p$ distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables) and the [Kullback\\-Leibler divergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) (along with myriad related distance measures: symmetrized divergence, Hellinger distance, mutual information, *etc.*). The comparison suggests $(X,Y)$ may have a circular structure when it is \"close\" to $(\\\\Xi, H)$. In this case the structure can be \"extracted\" from properties of $F$. For instance, a measure of central location of $F$, such as its mean or median, identifies the \"radius\" of the distribution of $(X,Y)$, and the standard deviation (or other measure of scale) of $F$ expresses how \"spread out\" $(X,Y)$ are in the radial directions about their central location $(\\\\mu\\_X, \\\\mu\\_Y)$.\n\nWhen **sampling** from a distribution, with data $(x\\_i,y\\_i), 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$, a reasonable test of circularity is to estimate the central location as usual (with means or medians) and thence convert each value $(x\\_i,y\\_i)$ into polar coordinates $(r\\_i, \\\\theta\\_i)$ relative to that estimated center. Compare the standard deviation (or IQR) of the radii to their mean (or median). For non\\-circular distributions the ratio will be large; for circular distributions it should be relatively small. (If you have a specific model in mind for the underlying distribution, you can work out the sampling distribution of the radial statistic and construct a significance test with it.) Separately, test the angular coordinate for uniformity in the interval $\\[0, 2\\\\pi)$. It will be approximately uniform for circular distributions (and for some other distributions, too); non\\-uniformity indicates a departure from circularity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A bivariate distribution is suspected to have a circular structure. To investigate this, a researcher performs the following steps:\n\n1. Estimates the central location (\u03bcX, \u03bcY) using sample means\n2.

A relatively small spread of the radii around their central value, which would result in a low ratio of the standard deviation of radii to their mean.\n2. A uniform distribution of the angular coordinates, as all directions from the center should be equally probable in a circular distribution.\n\nOption C correctly combines these two characteristics. A low ratio in step 3 indicates that the radii are clustered around their mean, suggesting a ring-like structure. The uniform distribution in step 4 suggests that this ring-like structure is evenly distributed in all directions, which is consistent with a circular pattern.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because a high ratio in step 3 would indicate a large spread in the radii, which is inconsistent with a circular structure.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it has a low ratio in step 3, the non-uniform distribution in step 4 suggests an uneven distribution around the circle, which is not characteristic of a purely circular structure."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/19", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/455807", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/60120/"], "docs_id": 455807, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to draw a shape that I want to reuse.

This way, instead of calculating the lightning equation/dot product for each pixel on display, I would just need to calculate it for each normal stored on the image index, and replace the image index by the equivalent light intensity obtained for each normal when displaying the image. It has obvious shortcomings, such as the need for an infinitely distant (or parallel) light source (instead of point light sources), but for my purposes it works just fine.\n\nSo, in a new attempt to reduce even further the computing power required for the operation, and compress the map even further, I imagined what would be needed to generate an ideal index, given an space constraint (amount of stored normals). Turns out it's the very key idea about my question that will solve this as well.\n\nThe main problem\n================\n\nThe above problem can be solved for N indexes *if* there's a way to partition a spherical shell of unitary radius into N equal\\-area shell segments/cuts, much like an optimised Voronoi Diagram, albeit in spherical space. A turtle shell is probably the best real\\-world analog to this idea:\n\n![Voronoi Tortoise](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBVqm.jpg)\n\nMy question basically boils down to, *\"Is there a way to partition a spherical shell into N polygonal segments, akin to a Voronoi Diagram (where the edges of the polygons themselves are straight arcs on the shell surface and the regions themselves are as \"uniform\" and sparse as possible on the shell surface), where each of those segments occupy exactly the same shell area?\"*\n\nConsiderations\n--------------\n\n* I assume a solution to this problem would be dependent on some sort of constraint, like a set of initial vectors or orientations.

Division into 3 is easy, so you can get partionings that consist of 20, 60, 180, 540 pieces, and so on.\n\nYou could do the same sort of thing starting with a tetrahedron, actually.

This gives exactly 60 equal-area segments (20 * 3 = 60). This approach is exact and repeatable, unlike randomized methods. It also precisely matches the number of segments requested (60), which the cube-based and dodecahedron-based methods do not. The icosahedron method is specifically mentioned in the documentation as a valid approach for creating equal-area partitions of a sphere."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/05", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/10698", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/885/"], "docs_id": 10698, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a **shell script** that's **reading from standard input**. In rare circumstances, there will be no one ready to provide input, and the script must **time out**. In case of timeout, the script must execute some cleanup code. What's the best way to do that?\n\nThis script must be **very portable**, including to 20th century unix systems without a C compiler and to embedded devices running busybox, so Perl, bash, any compiled language, and even the full POSIX.2 can't be relied on. In particular, `$PPID`, `read -t` and perfectly POSIX\\-compliant traps are not available. Writing to a temporary file is also excluded; the script might run even if all filesystems are mounted read\\-only.\n\nJust to make things more difficult, I also want the script to be reasonably **fast** when it doesn't time out. In particular, I also use the script in Windows (mainly in Cygwin), where fork and exec are particularly low, so I want to keep their use to a minimum.\n\nIn a nutshell, I have\n\n```\ntrap cleanup 1 2 3 15\nfoo=`cat`\n\n```\n\nand I want to add a timeout. I can't replace `cat` with the `read` built\\-in. In case of timeout, I want to execute the `cleanup` function.\n\n---\n\nBackground: this script is guessing the encoding of the terminal by printing some 8\\-bit characters and comparing the cursor position before and after. The beginning of the script tests that stdout is connected to a supported terminal, but sometimes the environment is lying (e.g. [`plink` sets `TERM=xterm` even if it's called with `TERM=dumb`](http://osdir.com/ml/emacs.tramp/2003-09/msg00011.html)). The relevant part of the script looks like this:\n\n```\ntext='\u00c9\u00e9'  # UTF-8; shows up as \u00c3\u00c3\u00a9 on a latin1 terminal\ncsi='\u241b['; dsr_cpr=\"${csi}6n\"; dsr_ok=\"${csi}5n\"  # \u241b is an escape character\nstty_save=`stty -g`\ncleanup () { stty \"$stty_save\"; }\ntrap 'cleanup; exit 120' 0 1 2 3 15     # cleanup code\nstty eol 0 eof n -echo                # Input will end with `0n`\n# echo-n is a function that outputs its argument without a newline\necho-n \"$dsr_cpr$dsr_ok\"              # Ask the terminal to report the cursor position\ninitial_report=`tr -dc \\;0123456789`  # Expect \u241b[42;10R\u241b[0n for y=42,x=10\necho-n \"$text$dsr_cpr$dsr_ok\"\nfinal_report=`tr -dc \\;0123456789`\ncleanup\n# Compute and return initial_x - final_x\n\n```\n\nHow can I modify the script so that if `tr` hasn't read any input after 2 seconds, it is killed and the script executes the `cleanup` function?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What about this:\n\n```\nfoo=`{ { cat 1>&3; kill 0; } | { sleep 2; kill 0; } } 3>&1`\n\n```\n\nThat is: run the output\\-producing command and `sleep` in the same process group, a process group just for them. Whichever command returns first kills the whole process group.\n\nWould anyone wonder: Yes, the pipe is not used; it's bypassed using the redirections. The sole purpose of it is to have the shell run the two process in the same process group.\n\n---\n\nAs Gilles pointed out in his comment, this won't work in a shell script because the script process would be killed along with the two subprocesses.\n\nOne way\u00b9 to force a command to run in a separate process group is to start a new interactive shell:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfoo=`sh -ic '{ cat 1>&3; kill 0; } | { sleep 2; kill 0; }' 3>&1 2>/dev/null`\n[ -n \"$foo\" ] && echo got: \"$foo\" || echo timeouted\n\n```\n\nBut there might be caveats with this (e.g. when stdin is not a tty?). The stderr redirection is there to get rid of the \"Terminated\" message when the interactive shell is killed.\n\nTested with `zsh`,`bash` and `dash`. But what about oldies?\n\n[B98](https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/148008/b98) suggests the following change, working on Mac OS X, with GNU bash 3\\.2\\.57, or Linux with dash:\n\n```\nfoo=`sh -ic 'exec 3>&1 2>/dev/null; { cat 1>&3; kill 0; } | { sleep 2; kill 0; }'`\n\n```\n\n\u2013  \n\n1\\. other than `setsid` which appears to be non\\-standard."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working on a shell script that needs to read from standard input with a timeout feature.

It's portable across different Unix-like systems, doesn't rely on non-standard features, and allows for cleanup code to be executed after a timeout. The use of `sh -ic` creates a new process group, preventing the main script from being killed, and the redirection handles both input and potential error messages."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/30", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/309225", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/86901/"], "docs_id": 309225, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How to override (`vendor/magento/module-gift-card/Model`) `Magento\\GiftCard\\Model\\AccountGenerator generate()` function Magento 2\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Please add the following code in your block file Eg:CustomBlock.php\n\n```\n<?php\nnamespace [vendor_name]\\[module_name]\\Block;\nclass CustomBlock extends \\Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Template\n{\n    protected $_customerSession;\n\n    public function __construct(\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Template\\Context $context,\n        \\Magento\\Customer\\Model\\SessionFactory $customerSession,\n        array $data = []\n    ) {\n        $this->customerSession = $customerSession;\n        parent::__construct($context, $data);\n    }\n  public function isCustomerLoggedIn()\n  {\n    $customer = $this->customerSession->create();\n        if(!($customer->isLoggedIn()))\n             return true;\n        return false;\n  }    \n}\n\n```\n\n?\\>\n\nand kindly add the following code in your template file\n\n```\n<?php\n$checkCustomer = $block->isCustomerLoggedIn();\nif($checkCustomer):\n   echo \"<b>Please Login!! </b>\";\nendif;\n?>\n\n```\n\nHope this helps you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento 2 custom module, you want to create a block that checks if a customer is logged in and displays a message accordingly.

An example of this is when the client expects that a JSON field or subobject will always be present, but a change on the server side causes the JSON to deviate from what is expected possibly returning a null value when null should never be a possible response.\n\nIt seem like the server side could always have unit tests that ensure that the JSON response fulfills the contract, but that's susceptible to human error if a developer decides to rewrite a test or simply makes a mistake in testing or misunderstands a requirement. The client side can check that the JSON response is valid, but this would need to occur at runtime and if the server is writing proper tests, the double\\-checking of the server response by the client would be unnecessary.\n\nIs there a recommended process to ensure that the contract (JSON response format) between the client and server doesn't get broken? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you should validate what you get, but you also need to be a Tolerant Reader:\n\n<http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html>\n\nMartin Fowler states that:\n\n> My recommendation is to be as tolerant as possible when reading data from a service. If you're consuming an XML file, then only take the elements you need, ignore anything you don't. Furthermore make the minimum assumptions about the structure of the XML you're consuming.\n\nWhich, to my experience is a good way to be resilient (tolerant) to changes.

How should the router know whether the packet destined to `192.168.2.100` is for interface A, B, or C, if they're all the same?

Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> But if there is two 'first photon' which is not coherence each other, then after some actions(induced emissions) there will be two family of photons inside of laser.\n\nThis is entirely normal. The \"first photons\" that start the laser action are generated by spontaneous emission. They are not coherent with each other, and there are normally more than one present in the cavity at a time.\n\n> how can we make two incoherent families of photons coherent and make real laser?\n\nWhat happens is, each time a photon from group \"1\" stimulates a new emission, that puts the excited atom involved back to the ground state. This reduces the number of excited atoms available to provide gain for group \"2\". \n\nThis produces a kind of positive feedback mechanism so that if group \"1\" has slightly more photons than group \"2\", then group \"1\" will quickly starve group \"2\" of gain, and group \"1\" will come to dominate. \n\nThis is related to the *gain pinning* effect. If you increase the pump power of a laser above the threshold level, typically this doesn't increase the population inversion, because stimulated emission increases and the excited population is locked at the threshold level (while output power increases). This means the gain spectrum is also \"pinned\" at the threshold level, so if the group \"1\" photons have a frequency at the peak of the gain spectrum, but group \"2\" are slightly off the peak, then group \"2\" will not have sufficient gain to overcome the cavity loss and will quickly die away.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that group \"1\" and \"2\" are not interacting with exactly the same set of atoms in the gain medium. For example, if group \"1\" are in a different spatial mode than group \"2\" so that they overlap a different part of the gain material. In this case both groups can lase simultaneously, and you have a *multi\\-mode* laser."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a laser cavity, two groups of photons (Group 1 and Group 2) are initially present, originating from spontaneous emission and not coherent with each other.

Option C is correct because it accurately describes the process of gain competition in lasers. One photon group is likely to dominate due to positive feedback and gain pinning, starving the other group of excited atoms. However, if the groups occupy different spatial modes in the gain medium, they may coexist, resulting in a multi-mode laser. Options A and B are incorrect as they don't account for gain dynamics.

Size of `long int` is at least 32 bits and not smaller than int.\n\n`sizeof(char) == 1; sizeof(long int) >= sizeof(int) >= sizeof(short int) >= sizeof(bool) >= sizeof(char).`\n\nThe actual memory model of C\\+\\+ is very compact **and predictable** though. For example there is no metadata in objects, arrays or pointers.

If the answer is no, what is an example?\n\n**Motivation, thoughts, and the soft question:** I am asking because on the one hand, it seems to me on general grounds that the fact that $f$ is defined uniquely in terms of the $T$\\-invariant measures $\\\\nu$ and $\\\\mu$ ought to force it to be $T$\\-invariant. (Where could the ability to change with $T$ come from, if not from $\\\\mu$ or $\\\\nu$?)

Maybe I'm just not being clever enough, but every time I've played with it so far, this is how it comes out. Thus if $T$ is invertible, I have the desired equality, but if not, then I am not sure.\n\nMeanwhile, if we make the additional assumption that $\\\\mu,\\\\nu$ are probability measures and that $\\\\mu$ is ergodic, then using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem I can prove that $\\\\nu \\= \\\\mu$, which of course implies that $f\\=1$. After some more work this implies that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular.\n\n**My soft question**, which is really what the title is about, is, does this result in some essential way \"come from\" the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem? If the answer above to (1\\) is yes, and it is possible to prove it without the BET, then this could in turn be used to prove that if $\\\\mu,\\\\nu$ are probability measures with $\\\\mu$ ergodic, then $\\\\nu\\=\\\\mu$, and then this would imply that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular without needing the BET. But my experience playing around so far makes it seem as though somehow without the BET, the definitions themselves are \"not enough power.\" Is there anything to this? If so, what do I really mean? What aspect of the situation that the BET illuminates is needed for this result?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A Blumenthal has already given a neat answer, but there is a more elementary argument for the invariance of $f$ that requires neither the ergodic theorem nor the backward martingale convergence theorem. This is shown in Peter Walters book (Theorem 6\\.10\\).\n\nFirst, note that for every measurable $E$,\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n \\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E\\\\setminus E) \\&\\= \\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E)\\-\\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E\\\\cap E) \\\\\\\\\n \\&\\= \\\\mu(E) \\- \\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E\\\\cap E) \\\\\\\\\n \\&\\= \\\\mu(E\\\\setminus T^{\\-1}E) \\\\;.\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nThis is true for every invariant measure, in particular,\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n \\\\nu(T^{\\-1}E\\\\setminus E) \\&\\= \\\\nu(E\\\\setminus T^{\\-1}E) \\\\;.\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nfor every measurable $E$.\n\nNow, for $r\\>0$, let $E\\_r:\\=\\\\{x: f(x)\\<r\\\\}$. Then,\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n \\\\int\\_{T^{\\-1}E\\_r\\\\setminus E\\_r}f\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu \\&\\=\n \\\\int\\_{E\\_r\\\\setminus T^{\\-1}E\\_r}f\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu \\\\;.\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nObserve that $f\\\\geq r$ on $T^{\\-1}E\\_r\\\\setminus E\\_r$ and $f\\<r$ on $E\\_r\\\\setminus T^{\\-1}E\\_r$. Therefore, $\\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E\\_r\\\\setminus E\\_r)\\=\\\\mu(E\\_r\\\\setminus T^{\\-1}E\\_r)\\=0$.\n\nIn words, this says that for every $r\\>0$, the set of points $x$ such that either $f(Tx)\\<r\\\\leq f(x)$ or $f(x)\\<r\\\\leq f(Tx)$ has $\\\\mu$\\-measure $0$, and this means $f(x)$ and $f(Tx)$ must agree almost everywhere.\n\n(More precisely,\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n \\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\{x: f(Tx)\\<f(x)\\\\}\\\\right) \\&\\\\leq\n \\\\sum\\_{r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Q}^\\+} \\\\mu(T^{\\-1}E\\_r\\\\setminus E\\_r) \\= 0\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nand similarly, $\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\{x: f(x)\\<f(Tx)\\\\}\\\\right)\\=0$.\nHence, $f\\\\circ T\\=f$ $\\\\mu$\\-almost everywhere.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a measurable space (X,\u212c) with a measurable self-map T:X\u21bb. Let \u03bc and \u03bd be T-invariant finite measures such that \u03bd \u226a \u03bc, and f \u2208 L\u00b9(X,\u03bc) be the Radon-Nikodym derivative d\u03bd/d\u03bc. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the T-invariance of f?\n\nA) f is always T-invariant for all measurable sets E \u2208 \u212c without any additional assumptions.\n\nB) f is T-invariant only if T is an invertible map.\n\nC) f is T-invariant, and this can be proved using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem.\n\nD) f is T-invariant, and this can be proved without using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem or equivalent advanced theorems.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation provides a proof of the T-invariance of f without using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem or other advanced theorems like the backward martingale convergence theorem. The proof uses elementary measure theory concepts and clever manipulation of sets to show that f(x) and f(Tx) must agree almost everywhere with respect to \u03bc. This demonstrates that f is indeed T-invariant, and this fact can be established without resorting to more advanced ergodic theory results.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while f is T-invariant, it's not trivially true for all cases without proof.\nOption B is incorrect because the invariance of f does not depend on T being invertible.\nOption C is incorrect because, while the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem could be used in some approaches, the given proof shows it's not necessary."}}
