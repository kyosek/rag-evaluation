Thank You \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If $B$ is a Boolean algebra with $\\\\bot$ as its bottom element (your $F$), an element $a\\\\in B$ is an *atom* of $B$ if $a\\\\ne\\\\bot$ and $\\\\{b\\\\in B:\\\\bot\\<b\\<a\\\\}\\=\\\\varnothing$. In other words the atoms of $B$ are the minimal non\\-$\\\\bot$ elements.\n\nYou can\u2019t show that $D\\_{30}$ by itself is a Boolean algebra, but you can show that it becomes one when you give it the right operations and order. The join of two elements of $D\\_{30}$ is their least common multiple, and the meet is their greatest common divisor: $m\\\\land n\\=\\\\gcd\\\\{m,n\\\\}$ and $m\\\\lor n\\=\\\\operatorname{lcm}\\\\{m,n\\\\}$. This means that the lattice order on $D\\_{30}$ is the divisibility relation: if $\\\\preceq$ denotes the lattice order ($m\\\\preceq n$ iff $m\\\\land n\\=m$), then $m\\\\preceq n$ iff $m\\\\mid n$. It\u2019s not hard to see that this means that $\\\\bot\\=1$ and $\\\\top\\=30$. The minimal elements of $D\\_{30}\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\}$ are then $2,3$, and $5$: every other member of $D\\_{30}\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\}$ has a non\\-trivial divisor and therefore fails to be minimal.\n\nTo show that $D\\_{30}$ with these operations really is a Boolean algebra, you simply have to verify that the operations have the required properties: each distributes over the other, and the lattice is complemented. The only part of this that perhaps isn\u2019t completely routine is figuring out what the complement of $n\\\\in D\\_{30}$ is. You need an element $m$ such that $n\\\\land m\\=\\\\bot$ and $n\\\\lor m\\=\\\\top$, i.e., such that $\\\\gcd\\\\{n,m\\\\}\\=1$ and $\\\\operatorname{lcm}\\\\{n,m\\\\}\\=30$; what\u2019s a simple description of that $m$ in terms of $n$?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Boolean algebra D\u2083\u2080 = {1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30} with operations defined as m\u2227n = gcd{m,n} and m\u2228n = lcm{m,n}, what is the complement of 6?\n\nA) 5\nB) 10\nC) 15\nD) 30\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: In a Boolean algebra, the complement of an element n is an element m such that n\u2227m = \u22a5 (bottom element) and n\u2228m = \u22a4 (top element).

In our daily live, when we consider thermodynamical systems the bound is never achieve; only thermodynamical systems at the scale of astronomical objects seem to satisfy it.\n\nWhy is the equality only achieved at certain scales? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Bekenstein bound tells the maximum entropy that can be contained within a given volume. It does not tell the maximum entropy of a closed system with a fixed energy density. The distinction is very important here. For a system with a relatively low energy density, the maximum entropy state is not a black hole. It is, instead, diffuse radiation. This is why Hawking Radiation exists. When a black hole radiates into empty space, total entropy is increased [(1\\)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.1683).\n\nSo, that's part of the answer to your question\\- low energy thermodynamic systems don't settle into black holes because that's not their highest entropy state in the first place. Your followup question might be: okay, so why is the limit for entropy *density* only satisfied on astronomical scales?\n\nI think the best answer I can give you is this: gravity is unique among the forces in that it is always attractive, and as a result it has much more capability to put matter, and thus entropy, in a compact area. But gravity is also, famously, much much weaker than any of the other forces, so it is only relevant on large scales where all the other forces are cancelled out due to screening effects. There is almost certainly a good reason that gravity has these two distinctive properties, but as far as I know we will need an understanding of quantum gravity to really address those questions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is studying the entropy of various systems in the universe.

The Bekenstein bound represents the maximum possible entropy for a given volume, not the maximum entropy for a system with fixed energy density. For most everyday systems with relatively low energy density, the maximum entropy state is not a black hole, but rather diffuse radiation. Gravity plays a crucial role in achieving the Bekenstein bound because it is always attractive and can compress matter and entropy into a compact area. However, gravity is much weaker than other forces and only becomes dominant at large scales where other forces are effectively cancelled out due to screening effects. This is why the Bekenstein bound is typically only approached or achieved for large astronomical objects like black holes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the bound is not equally applicable to all systems. Option B is wrong because smaller systems actually have lower entropy than the bound. Option D is incorrect because while thermodynamic equilibrium is related to maximum entropy, the Bekenstein bound itself is not limited to perfect equilibrium states."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/25", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/188384", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/44025/"], "docs_id": 188384, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I came across below style of writing if statements in C\\#, on msdn code examples.

To see this I will use the fact that an action $G \\\\curvearrowright (X, \\\\mu)$ is amenable if and only if there is a $G$\\-equivariant mean from $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. (A mean in this setting is a positivity preserving map which restricts to the identity on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$.) This is Theorem A (iv) in \"Amenable Actions of Groups\" by Adams, Elliott, Giordano (1994\\) ([http://www.ams.org/mathscinet\\-getitem?mr\\=1250814](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1250814)), which generalizes the case for countable groups established by Proposition 4\\.1 in \"Hyperfinite Factors and Amenable Ergodic Actions\" by Zimmer (1977\\) ([http://www.ams.org/mathscinet\\-getitem?mr\\=470692](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=470692)).\n\n**Theorem**: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable group. Then there exists a $G$\\-equivariant mean from $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$ if and only if for every continuous action of $G$ on a compact metric space $Y$, there exists a $G$\\-equivariant map from $X$ to $M(Y)$.\n\n**Proof**: For the proof I will find it easier to work with function spaces, and so first note that for a compact Hausdorff space $K$, there is a one\\-to\\-one correspondence between (equivalence classes of) Borel maps $\\\\pi: X \\\\to M(K)$ and means $\\\\Phi: L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes C(K) \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. (Here, $\\\\otimes$ is the $C^\\*$\\-tensor product.) This is essentially just the Riesz representation theorem applied to each fiber $K$.\n\nWe now show the \"only if\" direction. If $G \\\\curvearrowright K$ is a continuous action on a compact metric space, by restricting to a closed $G$\\-invariant subset we may assume that $G \\\\curvearrowright K$ has a dense orbit $K \\= \\\\overline{G k}$. We then obtain a $G$\\-equivariant embedding $\\\\rho: C(K) \\\\to C\\_b(G) \\\\subset L^\\\\infty(G)$ by $\\\\rho(f)(g) \\= f(gk)$. Restricting our invariant mean to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes \\\\rho(C(K))$ then gives the result.\n\nThe converse is a bit more involved, but this is well known for the case of amenable groups. The first step is to show that we have an equivariant mean on the space $UC\\_b(G)$ of bounded left uniformly continuous functions. In the case when $G$ is countable we are then done. For the general case we then use an approximate identity for convolution to produce an equivariant mean for $L^\\\\infty(G)$.\n\nTo produce a mean on the space $UC\\_b(G)$ note that for any second countable $G$\\-invariant $C^\\*$\\-subalgebra $A \\\\subset UC\\_b(G)$ we have that the Gelfand spectrum is metrizable, and $G$ acts continuously. Therefore by hypothesis there exists a $G$\\-equivariant mean $\\\\Phi\\_A: L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes A \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. Since $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$ is injective we may then extend $\\\\Phi\\_A$ to a (perhaps no longer $G$\\-equivariant) positivity preserving map $\\\\widetilde{\\\\Phi\\_A} : L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes UC\\_b(G) \\\\to L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu)$. If we consider the net $\\\\{ \\\\widetilde{\\\\Phi\\_A} \\\\}$ indexed by the set of all second countable $G$\\-invariant $C^\\*$\\-subalgebras $A$, and ordered by inclusion, then we may take an accumulation point $\\\\Phi$ in the topology of point\\-wise weak convergence. Since $\\\\Phi$ is $G$\\-equivariant when restricted to $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes A$ for any second countable $C^\\*$\\-subalgebra $A$, it follows that $\\\\Phi$ is $G$\\-equivariant on the whole space.\n\nTo produce a mean on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$ we start by taking an approximate identity $\\\\{ \\\\psi\\_n \\\\} \\\\subset C\\_c(G)$. Specifically, we want that each $\\\\psi\\_n \\\\in C\\_c(G)$ is a non\\-negative function, $\\\\\\| \\\\psi\\_n \\\\\\|\\_1 \\= 1$, ${\\\\rm supp}(\\\\psi\\_n) \\\\to \\\\{ e \\\\}$, and $\\\\\\| \\\\psi\\_n \\* \\\\delta\\_g \\- \\\\delta\\_g \\* \\\\psi\\_n \\\\\\|\\_1 \\\\to 0$ for each $g \\\\in G$. If $f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$, then we have $\\\\psi\\_n \\* f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\otimes UC\\_b(G)$ for each $n$ (I'm taking convolution pointwise in $X$), and $\\\\\\| \\\\sigma\\_g(\\\\psi\\_n \\* f) \\- \\\\psi\\_n \\* (\\\\sigma\\_g(f)) \\\\\\|\\_\\\\infty \\\\to 0$ for each $g \\\\in G$, and $f \\\\in L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$. (We denote by $\\\\sigma\\_g$ the action of $G$ on $L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\overline \\\\otimes L^\\\\infty(G)$.)

But if electrons are identical particles, how does it make sense to talk about them flowing?\n\nTo expand on that: imagine the simplest wire, just a 1\\-D chain of copper atoms, each with one conduction electron. If we apply a potetntial across the wire, what happens? Of course, we say there is a current, and the electrons \"flow\". But what does that really mean?\n\nSuppose when the electrons \"flow\", each copper atom gives its electron to the next atom in the line. From a QM perspective, nothing has changed! The 'before' wave function is identical to the 'after' wave function, because all that we have done is exchange particles, and the wavefunction has to be symmetric upon particle exchange.

In quantum mechanics, the flow of electrons in a conductor is not simply a matter of discrete particles moving from one atom to another. Instead, the wavefunction of electrons in a current-carrying wire includes a velocity-associated component. This component is present even in \"snapshots\" of the system and represents the continuous nature of electron flow.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the overall distribution of electrons might appear similar before and after current flow, the wavefunction is not identical due to the presence of the velocity component.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as quantum mechanics can and does explain current flow in conductors, albeit in a more complex way than classical physics.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the wavefunction does not change through sudden jumps; the velocity component represents a continuous flow rather than discrete movements.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how quantum mechanics describes current flow, challenging the common misconception that electron flow in conductors is simply a matter of particles moving from one fixed position to another."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/30", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/10822450", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1373525/"], "docs_id": 10822450, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a multipage in a userform.

You either burn the CUE/FLAC combination in a burner that can decode the FLAC data or you play it in something that understands what CUEs are (lots of players AFAIK).\n\nA CUE/FLAC is very much *like* an audio CD. An audio CD is just linear PCM data with a CDA\\-formatted header that states where all the track boundaries are. In your case the audio data has been losslessly compressed into the FLAC and the CUE is the track information.\n\nConverting to WAV only serves to undo the compression. You might need to do this to burn it to disk.\n\n---\n\nSplitting into separate tracks\n==============================\n\nIf you want to split the main FLAC into separate tracks, you can use the tools from the `shntool` [package](http://etree.org/shnutils/shntool/) as suggested in [this blog](http://onubuntu.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/splitting-cueflac-files.html):\n\n```\ncuebreakpoints filename.cue | shntool split -o flac filename.flac\n\n```\n\nYou can also specify another output format instead of FLAC (option `-o flac` in the example).\n\n(You'll need to install the commands first: `sudo apt-get install cuetools shntool`)\n\nTagging FLAC CD images for use with players like foobar\n=======================================================\n\nFLAC also allows for embedding cuesheets via `metaflac` and compatible taggers. Players like [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) and it's Linux equivalents ([DeaDBeeF](http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/) and [Guayadeque](http://guayadeque.org/)) can parse and play files with such metadata. Importing a properly tagged cuesheet (along with other metadata like pictures), will also import tags like individual tracknames, tracknumbers, artist and album tags.\n\nExcerpt from [metaflac manpage](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/metaflac.1.html):\n\n```\n--import-cuesheet-from=file\n    Import  a cuesheet from a file.  Use '-' for stdin.  Only one\n    FLAC file may be specified.  A seekpoint will  be  added  for\n    each  index  point  in  the  cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless\n    --no-cued-seekpoints is specified.\n\n```\n\nBut this kind of file format is rather unknown and unsupported outside the \"distributed CD backup community\".

Folder\\-by\\-feature is superior in the majority of cases.\n===============================================================================================================\n\nFolder\\-by\\-type is ok when you only have a small number of files (under 10 per type, let's say). As soon as you get multiple components in your project, all with multiple files of the same type, it gets very hard to find the actual file you are looking for.\n\nTherefore, folder\\-by\\-feature is better due to its scalability. However, if you use folder\\-by\\-feature, you end up losing information about the type of component a file represents (because it's no longer in a `controller` folder, let's say), so this too becomes confusing. There are 2 simple solutions for this.\n\nFirst, you can abide by common naming conventions that imply its type in the file name. For example, John Papa's popular [AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y120) has the following:\n\n> Naming Guidelines\n> -----------------\n> \n> \n> * Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. My recommended pattern is `feature.type.js`. There are 2 names for most assets:\n> \n> \n> \t+ the file name (`avengers.controller.js`)\n> \t+ the registered component name with Angular (`AvengersController`)\n\nSecond, you can combine folder\\-by\\-type and folder\\-by\\-feature styles into folder\\-by\\-feature\\-by\\-type:\n\n```\ncom.example\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pet\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers\n\u2502   |   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PetController1.java\n|   |   \u2514\u2500\u2500 PetController2.java\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Services\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 PetService1.java\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 PetService2.java\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 user\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers\n\u2502   |   \u251c\u2500\u2500 UserController1.java\n\u2502   |   \u2514\u2500\u2500 UserController2.java\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Services\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 UserService1.java\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 UserService2.java\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is debating the best approach for structuring their Java project.

Every textbook I've seen that discusses the SIS gives its potential as:\n\n$$\\\\Phi(r) \\= 4\\\\pi G\\\\rho\\_0r\\_0^2\\\\ln(r) \\+ {\\\\rm constant}$$\n\nAt first glance this seems nice: simple $\\\\ln(r)$ dependence, freedom to pick a constant.

Over $\\\\mathbb{C}$, the curve is isomorphic to $\\\\mathbb{C}/(\\\\mathbb{Z}\\+2i\\\\mathbb{Z})$. Indeed, the $j$\\-invariant of $E$ is $66^3\\=j(2i)$, and the conductor is $32$.

However, it is not generally true.**\n\nThe most basic properties of matrix multiplication show that the linear transformation represented by the matrix $\\\\mathbb{H}\\=X(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}X^\\\\prime$ satisfies\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{H}^2 \\= \\\\left(X(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}X^\\\\prime\\\\right)^2\\=X(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}(X^\\\\prime X)(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}X^\\\\prime\\=\\\\mathbb{H},$$\n\nexhibiting it as a [projection operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_%28linear_algebra%29). Therefore its complement\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{Q} \\= 1 \\- \\\\mathbb{H}$$\n\n(as given in the question) also is a projection operator. The trace of $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is its rank $h$ (see below), whence the trace of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ equals $n\\-h$.\n\nFrom its very formula it is apparent that $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is the matrix associated with the composition of two linear transformations $$\\\\mathbb{J}\\=(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}X^\\\\prime$$ and $X$ itself. The first ($\\\\mathbb{J}$) transforms the $n$\\-vector $y$ into the $p$\\-vector $\\\\hat\\\\beta$. The second ($X$) is a transformation from $\\\\mathbb{R}^p$ to $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ given by $\\\\hat y \\= X\\\\hat \\\\beta$. Its rank cannot exceed the smaller of those two dimensions, which in a least squares setting is always $p$ (but could be less than $p$, whenever $\\\\mathbb{J}$ is not of full rank). Consequently the rank of the composition $\\\\mathbb{H}\\=X\\\\mathbb{J}$ cannot exceed the rank of $X$. **The correct conclusion**, then, is\n\n> $\\\\text{tr} (\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\= n\\-p$ if and only if $\\\\mathbb{J}$ is of full rank; and in general $n \\\\ge \\\\text{tr} (\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\ge n\\-p$. In the former case the model is said to be \"identifiable\" (for the coefficients of $\\\\beta$).\n\n$\\\\mathbb{J}$ will be of full rank if and only if $X^\\\\prime X$ is invertible.\n\n---\n\n### Geometric interpretation\n\n$\\\\mathbb{H}$ represents the orthogonal projection from $n$\\-vectors $y$ (representing the \"response\" or \"dependent variable\") onto the space spanned by the columns of $X$ (representing the \"independent variables\" or \"covariates\"). The difference $\\\\mathbb{Q}\\=1\\-\\\\mathbb{H}$ shows how to decompose any $n$\\-vector $y$ into a sum of vectors $$y \\= \\\\mathbb{H}(y) \\+ \\\\mathbb{Q}(y),$$ where the first can be \"predicted\" from $X$ and the second is perpendicular to it. When the $p$ columns of $X$ generate a $p$\\-dimensional space (that is, are not collinear), the rank of $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is $p$ and the rank of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n\\-p$, reflecting the $n\\-p$ additional dimensions of variation in the response that are not represented within the independent variables. The trace gives an algebraic formula for these dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### Linear Algebra Background\n\nA projection operator on a vector space $V$ (such as $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$) is a linear transformation $\\\\mathbb{P}:V\\\\to V$ (that is, an *endomorphism* of $V$) such that $\\\\mathbb{P}^2\\=\\\\mathbb{P}$. This makes its complement $\\\\mathbb{Q}\\=1\\-\\\\mathbb{P}$ a projection operator, too, because\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{Q}^2 \\= \\\\left(1 \\- \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\right)^2 \\= 1 \\- 2\\\\mathbb{P} \\+ \\\\mathbb{P}^2 \\= 1\\-2\\\\mathbb{P}\\+\\\\mathbb{P} \\= \\\\mathbb{Q}.$$\n\nAll projections fix every element of their images, for whenever $v\\\\in \\\\text{Im}(\\\\mathbb{P})$ we may write $v \\= \\\\mathbb{P}(w)$ for some $w\\\\in V$, whence $$w \\= \\\\mathbb{P}(v) \\= \\\\mathbb{P}^2(v) \\= \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbb{P}(v)) \\= \\\\mathbb{P}(w).$$\n\nAssociated with any endomorphism $\\\\mathbb{P}$ of $V$ are two subspaces: its *kernel* $$\\\\text{ker}(\\\\mathbb{P}) \\= \\\\{v\\\\in v\\\\,\\|\\\\, \\\\mathbb{P}(v)\\=0\\\\}$$ and its *image* $$\\\\text{Im}(\\\\mathbb{P}) \\= \\\\{v\\\\in v\\\\,\\|\\\\, \\\\exists\\_{w\\\\in V} \\\\mathbb{P}(w)\\=v\\\\}.$$ Every vector $v\\\\in V$ can be written in the form $$v \\= w\\+u$$ where $w\\\\in \\\\text{Im}(\\\\mathbb{P})$ and $u\\\\in \\\\text{Ker}(\\\\mathbb{P})$. We may therefore construct a basis $E \\\\cup F$ for $V$ for which $E \\\\subset \\\\text{Ker}(\\\\mathbb{P})$ and $F \\\\subset \\\\text{Im}(\\\\mathbb{P})$. When $V$ is finite\\-dimensional, the matrix of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ in this basis will therefore be in block\\-diagonal form, with one block (corresponding to the action of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ on $E$) all zeros and the other (corresponding to the action of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ on $F$) equal to the $f$ by $f$ identity matrix, where the dimension of $F$ is $f$. The trace of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ is the sum of the values on the diagonal and therefore must equal $f\\\\times 1 \\= f$. This number is the *rank* of $\\\\mathbb{P}$: the dimension of its image.\n\nThe trace of $1\\-\\\\mathbb{P}$ equals the trace of $1$ (equal to $n$, the dimension of $V$) minus the trace of $\\\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nThese results may be summarized with the assertion that **the trace of a projection equals its rank.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a linear regression model y = X\u03b2 + \u03b5, where X is an n\u00d7p matrix of full rank, Q = I - X(X'X)^(-1)X' is the residual projection matrix.

We start with a given graph. At each time step we delete an edge $(i,j)$ and add two edges $e$ and $f$; the edge $e$ is incident with $i$ and a neighbour of $j$ (which is not already a neighbour of $i$), and the edge $f$ is incident with $j$ and a neighbour of $i$ (which is not already a neighbour of $j$). A stable configuration is a graph in which a step of the process gives an isomorphic graph. I would like to collect some information about the behaviour of the process and its stable configurations. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simone, this is really just a long comment rather than an answer, but I hope it'll be helpful.\n\nFirst of all, thank you for the clarifications. If I understand correctly now, the process at each step requires finding a path of length 3, $hijk$, with $h$ not connected to $j$ and $i$ not connected to $k$. The step itself consists of deleting the edge $ij$ and adding edges $e \\= ik$ and $f\\=hj$, and the process terminates when there is no path that meets the requirements. \n\nIt seems sensible to start by describing which graphs are \"terminal.\"\n\nNote the process doesn't change the connectivity of the graph, so we may as well assume that the initial graph $G$ is connected. \n\nOne type of (connected) graph that is terminal is one that has no paths of length 3 at all \\-\\- i.e., a \"star,\" all of whose edges emerge from a single, central point.\n\nAt the other end of the terminal spectrum are the complete graph, the complete graph minus one edge (I believe you mentioned this graph in an early version of the problem), and the complete graph minus two edges with a common vertex.\n\nOne pertinent question is, are there any other types of terminal graphs?\n\n(**Added 11/14/11**: In a comment on Joseph O'Rourke's animated graphics, Brendan McKay notes that the complete graph minus *any* number of edges incident on a common vertex is terminal. How I failed to see that is anybody's guess. So the amended pertinent question is, does *this* exhaust the list of terminal graphs?)\n\n(**Added later on 11/14/11**: Sergey Norin has effectively answered the amended pertinent question. The set of terminal graphs is precisely the set of \"trivially perfect\" graphs. See Sergey's answer for an explanatory link.)\n\nI think what you're really asking is whether there are any graphs for which the selection of steps in the process can result in two different terminal graphs. It might be worth seeing what happens for connected graphs of small size, say with 5 or 6 vertices. (Actually 4 is a reasonable size to start with, but it doesn't take long to see that everything non\\-terminal terminates in the complete graph minus one edge.)\n\nI tried one example with 5 edges: Starting from a single closed loop of length 5 (i.e., the perimeter of a pentagon), I found the process always terminates in the complete graph minus one edge. Maybe someone can flesh this out to a complete analysis of the 5\\-vertex case. Whether this will help understand what happens in general is anybody's guess, but at least it'd get things started.\n\n**Added 11/16/11**: I'm adding something here that I originally posted as a comment, and expounding on it a little, because it may have gotten lost in the shuffle.\n\nIf you start with a complete graph minus the 3 edges AD, AE, and BC, then you can terminate in one step by deleting AB and adding AD and BC, or in two steps by deleting CD and adding AD and BC (followed by the deletion of DE and addition of AE and CD). So there certainly are some graphs for which the terminal state depends on the selection of steps.\n\nThus is may be of interest to distinguish between graphs whose terminal state is \"predestined\" regardless of the steps they take, and those that have \"free will\" to choose, say between the Heaven of one terminal state and the Hell of some other. E.g., the closed loop of length 5 is predestined to end as the complete graph (on 5 vertices) minus one edge, whereas the complete graph minus edges AD, AE, and BC has free will."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a graph transformation process where at each step, an edge (i,j) is deleted and two new edges e and f are added, with e connecting i to a neighbor of j (not already connected to i), and f connecting j to a neighbor of i (not already connected to j). Which of the following statements is true about the terminal states of this process?\n\nA) All graphs will eventually terminate in a complete graph.\nB) The only possible terminal states are star graphs and complete graphs.\nC) The terminal state of a graph is always predetermined, regardless of the sequence of transformations.\nD) Trivially perfect graphs are the only possible terminal states of this process.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there are terminal states that are not complete graphs, such as star graphs or complete graphs minus some edges.\nB is incorrect because there are other terminal states besides star graphs and complete graphs, such as complete graphs minus one or more edges connected to a single vertex.\nC is incorrect because, as shown in the example with a complete graph minus edges AD, AE, and BC, the terminal state can depend on the sequence of transformations chosen.\nD is correct. As mentioned in the documentation, Sergey Norin noted that the set of terminal graphs for this process is precisely the set of \"trivially perfect\" graphs.

Later, you can upgrade in the same manner, deleting the old JVM from that folder. \n\n[![screenshot of Finder showing JavaVirtualMachines folder](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDnDw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDnDw.png)\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nYes, there have been several major changes to the evolution of Java in recent years, and they can be a bit confusing. \n\nMultiple vendors, both free and paid\n====================================\n\nFirst, know that there are new options available for those wishing to pay for commercially supported implementations of Java. And know that Java is still available freely without cost. For both a summary as well as the gory details, read this white paper published by major figures in the Java community: [*Java Is Still Free*](https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-c02aef8c9e04)\n\nOpenJDK\n=======\n\nSecondly, know that all releases for Java 11 and later for macOS are based on the same codebase, the open\\-source project known as [OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK). \n\nApple contributes Mac\\-specific code to this project, and has staff working on this to make sure that Java continues to work well on macOS. \n\nIBM, Oracle, and many other companies have contributed code and testing as well. Oracle has recently announced their intention to reach feature\\-parity between their own Oracle\\-branded Java releases and the OpenJDK product; this even included the donation of some of their previously\\-commercial tools such as [*Flight Recorder*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328) to OpenJDK. \n\nThe upshot is that you should see very similar behavior and features across the various sources of Java for macOS.\n\nJVM bundled within desktop apps\n===============================\n\nIf you make desktop apps to run locally on a Mac or other computer, you may continue to do so, and keep on using Swing and/or JavaFX as always. But the delivery of your app will change. \n\n[*Java Applet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) and [*Java Web Start*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start) technologies are being phased out. Oracle will no longer encourage end\\-users to have a JVM by itself installed. Instead, Oracle advises building your app as a standalone executable with a JVM bundled inside. This has already been commonly done on Macs, especially so if [delivering an app through the Apple App Store](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Astackoverflow.com%20%2Bjava%20apple%20app%20store&t=osx&ia=web). That approach is the new normal, to be done across all platforms including macOS, Windows, Linux, etc. The new [Java Modularization](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) technology that began with Java 9, including the [*jlink*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282) and [*jpackage*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343) tools, make it easier than ever to [bundle a down\\-sized JVM](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275) with your app. \n\nFor more info, see the white paper [*Java Client Roadmap Update*](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javaclientroadmapupdate2018mar-4414431.pdf) of 2018\\-03\\.\n\nSo, for the purpose of bundling with your app, you will need to consider redistribution/deployment rights when choosing a JVM vendor and product. \n\nChoosing a vendor\n=================\n\nSome major vendors of Java to consider for Java 11 and later:\n\n* [**Azul Systems**](https://www.azul.com)  \nOffering two product lines, *Zulu* based directly on OpenJDK with possibly a few tweaks, and *Zing* a specially\\-enhanced version of the Java platform.\n* **Oracle**  \nOffering their own commercial product [*Oracle JDK*](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and the quite\\-similar free\\-of\\-cost and GPL\\-licensed [*jdk.java.net*](https://jdk.java.net).\n* **AdoptOpenJDK.net**  \nOffering free\\-of\\-cost builds of Java based on OpenJDK. Choose between with the usual [*HotSpot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotSpot) engine (just\\-in\\-time compiler \\& optimizer) or the [*OpenJ9*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJ9) engine from Eclipse (previously from IBM).\n\nHere is a diagram chart that may help guide your decision\\-making. This chart is not necessarily complete or accurate. It is simply meant to help get you oriented. You should research further your options. \n\n[![Flowchart guiding you in choosing a vendor for a Java 11 implementation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSJPb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSJPb.png)\n\n---\n\n[![Motivations in choosing a vendor for Java](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJIq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJIq.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a Java application for macOS and needs to choose a Java Development Kit (JDK) for their project.

How should this affect lists such as the [Largest Known Primes](http://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php)?\n\nLet me give a little more detail to demonstrate why I feel this question is not entirely trivial or fanciful. \n\nFirstly, the requirement that the function be able to concretely generate primes is meant to avoid 'stupid' examples such as Nextprime(n) which, given a 'largest known prime' P, yields a larger prime Nextprime(P). Note however that the definition of Nextprime does not actually explicitly state what this prime is, any implementation of it (in Maple or Mathematica for example) simply loops through the integers bigger than the input, testing each for primality in some fashion.\n\nOn the other hand, one candidate for such a function might be the Catalan sequence defined by:\n\n$C(0\\) \\= 2$, $C(n\\+1\\) \\= 2^{C(n)}\\-1$\n\nAlthough $C(5\\) \\= 2^{170141183460469231731687303715884105727}\\-1$ is far too large to test by current methods (with rougly $10^{30}$ times as many digits as the current largest known prime), and although the current consensus is that $C(5\\)$ is likely composite, it does not seem entirely out of the realm of possibility that someone might eventually find some very clever way of showing $C(5\\)$ is prime, or even that $C(n)$ is always prime, or perhaps some other concretely defined sequence.\n\nThe point is this: once one knows that every element of a sequence is prime, does this entirely negate things like the list of largest known primes? Or does the fact that $C(n)$ for $n\\\\geq 5$ has too many digits to ever calculate all of them (instead only being able to calculate the first few or last few digits) mean that even if they were somehow proven prime it would not technically be 'known'?\n\nNote also that in the realm of finite simple groups the analogous question is already tough to decide since there are infinite families of such groups known, but concrete descriptions (such as generators and relations or character tables) are not always available or even computable within reasonable time constraints. Likewise one could pose analogous questions in other branches (largest volume manifolds with certain constraints, etc.)\n\nAnyhow, it seems like a reasonable question for serious mathematicians to consider, so I just want to hear what other's opinions are on the subject (and if anyone can think of a better title, feel free to suggest).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, I don't think the idea that \"knowing a prime requires knowing its decimal expansion\" accords well with mathematical practice. Unless I'm mistaken, the largest known primes are all Mersenne primes, and (for good reason!) are almost always written in the form p\\=2k\\-1, not by their decimal expansions. Granted, the currently\\-known Mersennes are small enough that one *could* calculate their decimal expansions in Maple or Mathematica, if for some reason one wanted to. But even if that weren't the case (say, if k had 10,000 digits), I'd still be perfectly happy to describe p\\=2k\\-1 as a \"known prime,\" provided someone knew both k and a proof that p was prime.\n\nOn the other hand, similar to what you suggested with your \"NextPrime\" function, what about\n\np :\\= the 1010^10000th prime number ?\n\nCertainly p exists, and one can even write a program to output it. But is p therefore \"known\"? Saying so seems to stretch the meaning of the word \"known\" beyond recognition.\n\nTrying to arrive at some principled criterion that separates the two examples above, here's the best that I came up with:\n\n***An n\\-digit prime number p is \"known\" if there's a known algorithm to output the digits of p that runs in poly(n) time (together with a proof that the algorithm does indeed output a prime number and halt in poly(n) steps).***\n\n(Strictly speaking, the above definition covers \"known\\-ness\" for infinite families of primes, rather than individual primes \\-\\- since once you fix p, you can always output it in O(1\\) time. But this is a standard caveat.)\n\nAs far as I can see, the above definition correctly captures the intuition that a prime p is \"known\" if we know a closed\\-form formula for p (which can be evaluated in polynomial time), but *not* if we merely know a non\\-constructive definition of p (for which it takes exponential time to determine which p we're talking about).\n\nA very interesting test case for my definition is\n\np :\\= the first prime larger than 1010^10000.\n\nAccording to my definition, the above prime is currently \"unknown\", but will become \"known\" if someone proves the conjecture that the spacing between two consecutive n\\-digit primes never exceeds q(n) for some fixed polynomial q.\n\nIf you accept my definition, then a \"function that always generates primes\" almost certainly *would* trivialize largest\\-prime contests, since presumably it would give a deterministic way to generate n\\-digit primes in nO(1\\) time, for n as large as you like (which is not something that we currently have).\n\nNow, maybe there are cases where my definition fails to match up with \"intuitive knowability\" \\-\\- if so, I look forward to seeing counterexamples!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, which of the following best describes when an n-digit prime number p is considered \"known\"?\n\nA) When its decimal expansion can be calculated using software like Maple or Mathematica\n\nB) When there's a known algorithm to output its digits in poly(n) time, along with a proof of primality and algorithm runtime\n\nC) When it can be expressed in a closed-form formula, regardless of computation time\n\nD) When it's the largest prime in a specific mathematical sequence\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The top answer proposes a definition for when a prime number is considered \"known\". It states that an n-digit prime number p is \"known\" if there's a known algorithm to output the digits of p that runs in poly(n) time, together with a proof that the algorithm does indeed output a prime number and halt in poly(n) steps. This definition captures the intuition that a prime is \"known\" if we have an efficient way to generate it, not just a theoretical definition. Option A is incorrect because merely being able to calculate a number doesn't make it \"known\" in this context. Option C is too broad, as it doesn't consider the computation time.

The actual problem here is that an authentication challenge is only being presented the first time a connection is established for that URL while the app is open.\n\nAs explained [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1727/_index.html)\n\nA TLS session is processor intensive and Apple doesn't want you to create a new one every time a connection is made to that URL, so they cache one for you. In this case, it's working against you, but you should be able to work around the issue by including a \".\" character at the end of your host.\n\nIn our case, we were trying to establish a connection to a web server containing a certificate issued by an in\\-house CA. Since we knew the CA wouldn't be trusted on the first connection, we allowed the connection to continue so that the CA could be downloaded. During that connection, we add the \".\" character to the end of the host. All subsequent connections use the regular URL without the \".\" character at the end of the host. This ensures that the CA cert we downloaded is validated the first time a \"real\" connection is made."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When implementing SSL certificate validation in iOS, you notice that the delegate method canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace is only called once for a given URL.

By using a slightly different URL (with the added \".\") for the initial connection, it forces a new TLS session for the first connection.

They are 5 amps at 12 volt output (60 watts). Allowing for inefficiency, they probably draw 80 watts max on the 120VAC side. Three of them would be 240W, easily within the 1800W (120Vx15A) hard max on a 15A circuit. Like this. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSFX5.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSFX5.png)\n\nAll the DC wiring here can be 18 AWG except for the 120VAC wiring on the left, which must be 14AWG. You see why I don't like those power supplies? \n\nHowever having worked with LED strips a lot, you are not going to be happy with the final result. You will have 3 separate installations of LED strip that will operate totally independently from each other and respond separately to commands from the remote. Not every controller will see every signal from the remote, so you'll never get the colors or brightness to match each other, assuming all 3 remotes are even compatible with each other (and not serialized). If you are rolling/cycling colors, the three strips will be out of sync. Try it for yourself, but I think it will find it frustrating, amateurish and dreadful, and you'll either rip it out in frustration, or look for a better way to do it. \n\nFor 12VDC to the strip lights\n-----------------------------\n\nThere are several ways to make an installation of this size work well. One is to power them all from a single larger DC supply, and have all that go through dimmers/amplifiers. Here on out I assume you have a larger 12VDC supply of your own. \n\nThe \"standard\" in LED strips is generally: \n\n* 12 volts DC\n* 300 emitters per 5 meters\n* 2 amps per channel per 300 emitters \\-\\- in a 3528 single\\-color strip, that's straight up 2 amps. 5050s have 3 emitters \\- commonly RGB but sometimes WWW (all three white). They have 3 channels, 2 amps per channel or 6A total.\n\nOf course there are modifications on that. Double density or half density; 24V; coolwhite\\-warmwhite\\-yellow, just to name a few. \n\nYour example seems to be a peculiar one. It's 5050, but they seem to be alternating RGB with WWW. They claim that the WWW can be controlled separately from the RGB (you would hope!) but that means they are doing something weird in terms of how the strip is wired. It is not 3 channels, it looks like 4\\. \n\nBut since half the total lights are on the \"white\" chanel, half the 6A power is on that channel, or 3A per strip. The three RGB channels split what remains, 1A each. \n\nPower all three strips from one supply\n--------------------------------------\n\nThree strips together would be 9A on the white, 3A on each R/G/B color, or 18A for any feeder wire that is handling all the power for all of them. Also, 18A on the return ('neutral') wire. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/owSiG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/owSiG.png)\n\nThe 120VAC wire must be 14AWG. The feed between power supply and controller must be 12AWG (14AWG would not suffice \\- I believe that was your original question.) If any distance is involved, go10 AWG and you'll want stranded wire so it's more flexible. The return back from the strip must also be 12AWG and the \"white\" wire must be 16 AWG or larger. Color wires can be 18AWG or larger.\n\nSince you're working in DC power, there is no requirement to have the \"return\" wire run in the same cable as the \"supply\" wires. So you could use 14/4 for the supply to all 4 colors, then run a single\\-strand 12AWG wire for the return. Or 12/2 for the white and return, and 18AWG thermostat wire for the rest. Since it's low voltage DC you are not obliged to use white/blue for neutral and green for ground. \n\nAnother option is do a separate \"homerun\" for each 5\\-metre strip, so the return would be only 6 amps, which would permit you to use 18AWG intercom wire of however many strands you need. \n\nOne controller, three power supplies\n------------------------------------\n\nYou could power each strip separately, and control them centrally using amplifiers. To do this, assemble each LED strip in the normal way, but use an amplifier where the controller would go. Then use one controller, and split its R G B W and common wires to each of the amplifiers. This means all three strings will be the same color, do the same patterns, etc. You will end up with 2 spare controllers, but you will have to buy 3 amplifiers.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcbFq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcbFq.png)\n\nAll the wire can be 18 AWG here except for the 120VAC wiring which must be 14AWG. The wires to the controller draw very low current, but wire thinner than 18AWG isn't any cheaper. \n\n(it's possible to hook up one string normally and use amplifiers only with the other two. I don't recommend that, it'll be hard to troubleshoot, and the strings will not be equal.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is installing three 5-meter LED strip lights, each requiring 9A on the white channel and 1A each on the R/G/B channels. If powering all three strips from one 12VDC supply, what is the minimum wire gauge required for the main feed between the power supply and controller, and why?\n\nA) 14 AWG, because it's sufficient for up to 15A at 120VAC\nB) 12 AWG, because the total current draw is 18A and 14 AWG is insufficient\nC) 10 AWG, because it provides extra capacity for future expansion\nD) 16 AWG, because low-voltage DC requires less wire thickness than AC\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

A good rule of thumb is that if you can hold your finger/hand on the part, it's under 40C; if you're not particularly heat sensitive the part could be as hot as 50C.\n\nI feel that you are not giving us all of the information. Take your time and methodically work the problem. When the board is cold, the system works. After a while, it stops and you keep mentioning that the rails are shorted. I'm willing to bet that nothing is shorted and the output is simply 0V. Feel around. Something will be getting hot. Probe around; watch the 8V, 5V and 3\\.3V rails \\-\\- something is going to move \\-\\- either suddenly or gradually.

This mismatch can lead to several problems:\n\n1. It can cause the voltage regulators to \"fight\" each other through the sensors and MCU, potentially leading to thermal stress and failure over time.\n2. The incompatibility may damage the I/O ports of the microcontroller, which are not designed to handle 5V inputs when operating at 3.3V.\n3. This situation explains why the board works initially but fails after a few minutes, as it takes time for the thermal issues to build up.\n4. The gradual increase in resistance between Vcc and GND over time also suggests a thermal problem, as components cool down after failure.\n\nWhile other factors like improper grounding (B) or faulty components (A and D) could potentially cause issues, they are less likely to explain the specific behavior described, particularly the time-dependent nature of the failure and the voltage incompatibility explicitly mentioned in the documentation."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/02", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/173854", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57434/"], "docs_id": 173854, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is one oscillation from peak to trough to peak again or is it just peak to trough?

But about the other meaning, it seems the two sources do not entirely agree if \"an oscillation\" is `between maximum and minimum` or if it is `a single cycle` (that is, from maximum to maximum).\n\nWe are close to the answer, but a proper place for such a question would rather be <https://english.stackexchange.com/>\n\n---\n\n> **Is an oscillation the same as a period?**\n\nYour title is another question. And the answer is no.\n\nThe word \"period\" means something very specific, and is *not* the same thing as an oscillation in either meaning. A \"period\" is not the act of swinging, but the *time* for a complete cycle of the oscillation (from maximum to maximum).

Since 10 full swings occur in 20 seconds, the period is 20/10 = 2 seconds. There is some ambiguity in the definition of one oscillation, but the most commonly accepted definition in physics is a complete cycle from one extreme position, through the equilibrium position to the other extreme, and back to the starting position.

I decided to share it here on [magento.stackexchange.com](http://magento.stackexchange.com) as many may benefit from a well refered solution to this exception.\n\nThere is a link to the original Community Forum post: [Email template with block](https://community.magento.com/t5/Programming-Questions/Email-template-with-block/m-p/50061#M1219)\n\nIt seems that this solution, as quoted by [@dunagan5887](https://community.magento.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/183634); `dictates that the di.xml directive set in vendor/magento/module-developer/etc/adminhtml/di.xml is loaded.`\n\n**The Solution Consists of this Simple Line of Code:**\n\n> $this\\-\\>\\_objectManager\\-\\>configure($this\\-\\>\\_configLoader\\-\\>load('adminhtml'));\n\n---\n\n**Please find a working version command line class below:**\n\n> app/code/NameSpace/Module/Console/Command.php\n\n```\n<?php\nnamespace NameSpace\\Module\\Console\\Command;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputArgument;\nuse Magento\\Framework\\Exception\\LocalizedException;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\nclass CustomCommandClass extends Command\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\State $state,\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\ObjectManagerInterface $objectManager,\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\ObjectManager\\ConfigLoaderInterface $configLoader\n    ) {\n        $state->setAreaCode('frontend'); //SET CURRENT AREA\n        $objectManager->configure($configLoader->load('frontend')); //SOLUTION\n        parent::__construct();\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\n```\n\n**Simply change the area from `frontend` to `admin` or `global` as required by your application.**\n\n---\n\n\\[UPDATE]\n---------\n\nArea `adminhtml` causing static content deploy errors\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt seems that for some reasons setting the area to `adminhtml` is causing some errors while deploying static contents.\n\nWe were seeing errors like the following:\n\n```\nFatal error: Uncaught Exception: Warning: Error while sending QUERY packet. PID=22912 in ../magento/vendor/magento/zendframework1/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php on line 228 in ../magento/vendor/magento/framework/App/ErrorHandler.php:61\n\n```\n\nI initially thought that this error would be caused by a low `max_allowed_packet` setting for MYSQL but as the limit was already high enough and raising it wasn't resolving the issue, I decided to dig further. After going through an elimination process I finally found out that this was the main difference between two modules using similar command functions, from which one of the modules was causing this issue as soon as enabled.\n\nAlthough I haven't digged to find the source of this issue or conflict, I thought it would be a good idea to share my findings here as others may find it useful.\n\n---\n\n\\[UPDATE \\- 2]\n--------------\n\nThe right method:\n-----------------\n\n**After upgrading Magento to 2\\.2\\.X we realized that this is the right method for setting the area:**\n\n> app/code/NameSpace/Module/Console/Command.php\n\n```\n<?php\nnamespace NameSpace\\Module\\Console\\Command;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputArgument;\nuse Magento\\Framework\\Exception\\LocalizedException;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\nclass CustomCommandClass extends Command\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\State $state,\n    ) {\n        $this->_appState = $appState;\n        parent::__construct();\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n    {\n        $this->_appState->setAreaCode(\\Magento\\Framework\\App\\Area::AREA_GLOBAL); //SET CURRENT AREA\n\n        ...\n\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNote that we do not make use of the Object Manager and that the area has to be set within the function requiring it and NOT in the constructor. This is the official way of setting the area and it should work flawlessly with all Magento 2 versions.\n\n---\n\n**A list of the available areas is available in the following class:**\n\n> Magento\\\\Framework\\\\App\\\\Area\n\n```\nclass Area implements \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\AreaInterface\n{\n    const AREA_GLOBAL = 'global';\n    const AREA_FRONTEND = 'frontend';\n    const AREA_ADMIN    = 'admin';\n    const AREA_ADMINHTML = 'adminhtml';\n    const AREA_DOC = 'doc';\n    const AREA_CRONTAB = 'crontab';\n    const AREA_WEBAPI_REST = 'webapi_rest';\n    const AREA_WEBAPI_SOAP = 'webapi_soap';\n\n    ...\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When sending emails from the command line in Magento 2, you encounter an exception related to missing arguments for DebugHints.

This is the official and recommended way to set the area in Magento 2 command classes.\n\nOption A and C are older methods that are not recommended and may cause issues with static content deployment.\n\nOption B sets the area code in the constructor, which is not the correct location for setting the area in newer Magento versions.\n\nOption D correctly sets the area code within the execute() method, which is the proper place for this operation in Magento 2.2.X and later. It also uses the constant AREA_GLOBAL from the \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\Area class, which is the recommended way to reference area codes."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/07/28", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/14659", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 14659, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need the key 1/2 (one\\-half) but I can't find it on my mac keyboard.\n\nMy keyboard is a Danish Mac keyboard.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Quick reference: copy it from here: \n\n> \u00bd\n> =\n\nand paste where needed \\=)\n\nOther than that; here's how you can produce the symbol:\n\n### 2016 update\n\nI'm currently on Yosemite (10\\.10\\) and nowadays (I assume this works the same on El Capitan) you can hit **Ctrl\\-Cmd\\-Space** (^\u2318Space) to launch the very useful **Emoji \\& Symbols** utility.
