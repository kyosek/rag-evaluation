I was struck, and somewhat puzzled, by the inexplicable perfection of characters as a tool for studying representations of a group; they classify modules up to isomorphism, the characters of irreducible modules form an orthonormal basis for the space of class functions, and other facts of that sort.\n\nTo me, characters seem an arbitrary object of study (why take the trace and not any other coefficient of the characteristic polynomial?), and I've never seen any intuition given for their development other than \"we try this, and it works great\". The proof of the orthogonality relations is elementary but, to me, casts no light; I do get the nice behaviour of characters with respect to direct sums and tensor products, and I understand its desirability, but that's clearly not all that's going on here. So, my question: is there a high\\-level reason why group characters are as magic as they are, or is it all just coincidence? Or am I simply unable to see how well\\-motivated the proof of orthogonality is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Orthogonality makes sense without character theory. There's an inner product on the space of representations given by $\\\\dim \\\\operatorname {Hom}(V, W)$. By Schur's lemma the irreps are an orthonormal basis. This is \"character orthogonality\" but without the characters.\n\nHow to recover the usual version from this conceptual version? Notice $$\\\\dim \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V,W) \\= \\\\dim \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V \\\\otimes W^\\*, 1\\)$$ where $1$ is the trivial representation. So in order to make the theory more concrete you want to know how to pick off the trivial part of a representation. This is just given by the image of the projection $\\\\frac1{\\|G\\|} \\\\sum\\_{g\\\\in G} g$.  \n\nThe dimension of a space is the same as the trace of the projection onto that space, so \n$$\n\\\\def\\\\H{\\\\rule{0pt}{1\\.5ex}H}\n\\\\dim \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V \\\\otimes W^\\*, 1\\) \\= \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(\\\\frac1{\\|G\\|} \\\\sum\\_{g\\\\in G} {\\\\large \\\\rho}\\_{\\\\small V \\\\otimes W^\\*}(g)\\\\right) \n\\= \\\\frac1{\\|G\\|} \\\\sum\\_{g\\\\in G} {\\\\large\\\\chi}\\_{V}(g)\\\\ {\\\\large\\\\chi}\\_{W}\\\\left(g^{\\-1}\\\\right)\n\\\\\\\\\n$$ using the properties of trace under tensor product and duals."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a finite group G and its complex representations. Which of the following statements best explains the relationship between the dimension of Hom(V,W) and character theory?\n\nA) The dimension of Hom(V,W) is always equal to the sum of the characters of V and W.\n\nB) The dimension of Hom(V,W) can be expressed as the inner product of the characters of V and W* (the dual of W) over the group elements.\n\nC) The dimension of Hom(V,W) is independent of character theory and can only be calculated using Schur's lemma.\n\nD) The dimension of Hom(V,W) is equal to the trace of the projection onto the trivial representation of V \u2297 W*.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The dimension of Hom(V,W) can indeed be expressed as the inner product of the characters of V and W* over the group elements. This relationship is derived from the equation:\n\ndim Hom(V,W) = dim Hom(V \u2297 W*, 1)\n\nWhere 1 is the trivial representation. The dimension of this space is equal to the trace of the projection onto the trivial part, which can be written as:\n\n(1/|G|) \u2211(g\u2208G) \u03c7_V(g) \u03c7_W(g^(-1))\n\nThis is precisely the inner product of the characters of V and W* over the group elements, normalized by the order of the group.

I think there could be a problem with my approach, therefore my question is raised: When working with MOD09GA product, is supposed QC bitmask for high aerosol quantity to return 4 values?\n\nAccording to the description of the quality assessment flags, there can be 4 combinations: `'00'`, `'01'`, `'10'` and `'11'`. Thus, it should and it does return 4 values as long as they exist in the QA layer.\n\n### Details\n\nThe quality assessment (binary) flags for MOD09GA Science Data Sets are indeed detailed in [MODIS Surface Reflectance User\u2019s Guide (Collection 6\\)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/306/MOD09_User_Guide_V6.pdf).

To exemplify, let us use the unsigned 16\\-bit integer 174272\\. Its binary form is (all code below in Python):\n\n```\nbin(174272)[2:]\n'101010100011000000'\n\n```\n\nShifting this bit\\-pattern to the right by 6 positions, will result in \n\n```\nbin(174272 >> 6)[2:]\n'101010100011'\n\n```\n\nwhich is the integer\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2)\n2723\n\n```\n\nwhich, by the way, is the same as\n\n```\n174272 / 2**6\n2723\n\n```\n\nTheory says we *multiply* if we shift to the left!)\n2. `& 3` performs a bitwise AND of all shifted `qc` values with `3` which is the integer form for the binary string `'11'`. The 'AND' operation will *compare* the first two bits of each (now shifted) `qc` pixel values with `'11'`. \n\nContinuing the example with the integer `174272`, the second step is:\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2) & 3\n3\n\n```\n\nThis is expected as we *compare* the first two bits (reading from right to left) `'1010101000`**`11`**`'` with `'11'` which in turn will result to `'11'` which is the binary form of the integer `3`.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the possible *comparisons* are:\n\n\t* `'00'` AND `'11'` results in `'00'` or `0`\n\t* `'01'` AND `'11'` results in `'01'` or `1`\n\t* `'10'` AND `'11'` results in `'10'` or `2`\n\t* `'11'` AND `'11'` results in `'11'` or `3`Thus, `np.unique(qcAerosol)` can return **at most** 4 different integer values (`0` or `1` or `2` or `3`).

When doing OOP, every language I've used implements some kind of access restriction. I like some access models better than others.\n\nI am on a team of Java developers. Our projects spend time in code reviews considering the access modifiers, their appropriateness, and the use of things like @VisibleForTesting (a Java annotation). Our projects also occasionally spend time de\\-finalizing or de\\-privatizing something in a 3rd party library if a source\\-code change is not feasible.\n\nI went looking for the research that shows how the use of access modifiers affects defect density or occurrences of run\\-time errors. I cannot find any studies on it. Maybe my Google\\-Fu is weak. What is the evidence that access modifiers actually provide the benefits we assume they do? Where are the studies that quantify the problems with how access modifiers are used?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me give you a real world example of when access modifiers \"mattered\" that I ran into personally:\n\nOur software is primarily python, and one way that python differs from most other OO languages is that there are no explicit access modifiers. Instead, it is convention to prefix methods and attributes that should be private with an underscore.\n\nOne day, a developer was working on a particular feature, and could not make it work with the interface of the object he was working with. But he noticed that if he worked with a particular attribute that was marked private, he could do what he wanted to do. So he did it, checked it in, and (unfortunately) it slipped past code review, and into the master branch.\n\nFast forward two years. That developer had moved on. We updated to a newer version of an underlying library. Code that had been reliably suddenly stopped working. This resulted in lots of debugging and back\\-and\\-forth messages with another team in a different time zone. \n\nEventually we figured out the issue: the developers who owned that underlying object changed the way it worked in a very subtle way. Subtle enough that no exceptions were thrown, no other errors occurred. The library just became flaky. This happened because the developers of that library had no clue that they were doing anything that would cause any troubles to anyone. They were changing something internal, not the interface.\n\nSo after the fact we did what should have been done originally: we asked the library developers to add a public method that solved our problem rather than mucking about with the internals of their objects.\n\nSo that's what access modifiers prevent. They ensure that the separation of interface and implementation is clear.

However, refrigerators don't operate at full power continuously. They are designed with thermal isolation and cycle their compressors on and off to maintain the desired internal temperature. The 243 kWh annual energy consumption figure takes into account these cycling patterns and the refrigerator's overall efficiency, including periods when the compressor is not running. This figure is likely based on standardized testing procedures that simulate typical usage patterns and environmental conditions.

(Footer is not a different template, modals are a complete set of HTML per type)\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. Override directly the modal templating from `Magento_Ui` \\-\\> `vendor/magento/module-ui/view/base/web/templates/modal` folder has all the templates for every option of the modal, including header, wrapper and footer. You will need to override these templates on your theme (your custom theme under `app/frontend`) dir keeping same path structure, deploy and you will see your new changes. Like I said before, this will change all the modal templates across the site, not only the one you \"need\" to.\n2. Extend the modal widget and create your own call to your new template path. This one is more complicated if you are not experienced with how Magento 2 development fallback works. For instance you will need to create your new widget for the new modal within your module, call the modal widget and extend it, change on the require path for a new template (depending on which type you want to change properly) and change the function `_renderModal` within your widget to call for the new template.\n\nTo give you the whole answer for the second option will take a lot, and requires for you to read more about how Magento development works and be familiar with it.

This approach provides the flexibility to change only the desired modal while maintaining the integrity of others.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Magento 2 modal templates are not typically edited through layout XML files. The modal structure is primarily controlled through JavaScript widgets and HTML templates.\n\nThe correct approach (C) involves creating a new widget that extends the existing modal widget, specifying a new template path, and modifying the _renderModal function to use the custom template.

This could have changed the output type of the library project, potentially from a static library to a dynamic library or vice versa. Such a change would cause linker errors even if the project dependencies are correctly set up.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question states that project dependencies were checked and were okay.\nOption B is unlikely because the question mentions that C++11-related issues were fixed and all projects compiled successfully.\nOption D is possible but less likely, as circular dependencies typically cause different types of build errors.\n\nThe correct approach to fix this issue would be to check and adjust the project configurations, particularly the output type of the library project, to ensure it matches the expected library type (static or dynamic) used by the dependent projects."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/06", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24185", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 24185, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was speaking to a statistician recently who suggested that using dummy variables rather than one variable with several levels reduced the constraints on models, particular reducing the assumption of linearity.

This can be because the thing is expensive in absolute terms, or because cheaper alternatives are available, or because the subject is paying for other people (often in addition to himself).\n\nIt's common to say that one *springs for* a more expensive model. \u201cHe even sprung for the good stuff\u201d means that not only did the unnamed person buy scotch for the narrator, but that person even brought good scotch, which presumably costs more. *Spring for* can have a connotation that the person is [indulging](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indulge) in a luxury.\n\nSome dictionaries (for example the [Oxford Advanced American Dictionary](http://oaadonline.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/spring+for#spring_2__93) list *spring for* as specifically meaning paying for someone else. But this is in fact not always the case, and I think it is not the primary meaning of the expression \u2014\u00a0*spring for* only connotes paying for someone else because the person is paying more than the minimum (which would be their share). For example the [Camdbridge American English Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/spring-for-something?q=spring+for) gives the example phrase \u201cTo increase the radio's performance, spring for a powered antenna\u201d: a powered antenna costs more than an ordinary antenna, but gives better performance."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of informal American English, what does the phrase \"spring for\" most accurately imply?\n\nA) To unexpectedly receive a gift from someone\nB) To pay more than the minimum expected amount for something\nC) To exclusively pay for other people's expenses\nD) To purchase alcoholic beverages for a celebration\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe phrase \"spring for\" in informal American English primarily means to pay money for something, often with the implication that the person is paying more than what might typically be expected. This can be due to the item being expensive, opting for a pricier alternative when cheaper options exist, or covering costs for others in addition to oneself.\n\nWhile option C touches on one possible use of the phrase (paying for others), it's too restrictive and doesn't capture the primary meaning.

I think it is per GR.\n\nI am sure this also fits into mathematics, otherwise people would not be making this argument.\n\nI may be wrong, and please feel free to correct me if you think so. But I do not think that is the case \\- i.e. mass/momentum does not approach infinite.\n\nMy simple argument is \\- if the mass/momentum of a moving particle approaches infinite and such a particle moving at speeds close to $c$, then it would be almost impossible to stop that particle. In other words, it should be equally difficult/impossible to slow it down.\n\nWe all know that though it is not possible to accelerate the particle further, but it is no big deal to slow it down. Slowing down an infinite mass/momentum would not be that easy. **Infinite mass reasoning must apply both ways \\- in speeding up as well as in slowing down. Has it been experimentally shown that it also applies to slowing down at limits close to $c$?** \n\nTherefore, I can argue that mass/momentum does not approach infinite, it is the forces that are rendered ineffective at such speeds because the force itself propagates at $c$ and can not accelerate anything as fast as itself, or faster. Force is rendered ineffective only in direction of motion (acceleration), not in opposite direction (slowing down).\n\n**Analogy how force may become ineffective** \\- In a way, we can not accelerate a car that is already going at 300 miles/hr by pushing with our hands, because humans can not move their hand as fast. But we can accelerate a car going at 5 miles an hour. As the speed gets closer and closer to that of force $c$, the force can not push it any more. Same way as we can not move our hand faster than 300 miles/hr and can not accelerate that car by pushing on it.

So, for slowing down, it will be 0, or $\\\\gamma \\\\approx 1$*\n\nThe effective force $F1$ when particle is moving at velocity $v$ and a force $F$ is applied:\n\n$$ F \\= \\\\gamma F1 \\= \\\\frac{F1}{\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\n\nThis way, the math does not change either.\n\nSo at limits close to $c$, the force must be fully effective in slowing down and pretty much ineffective in accelerating.\n\n**I am proposing below experiment to prove/disprove the concept. If someone is aware of such an experiment being done, please share the results.** \n\n1. Make a particle accelerate at \\~highest speed that the accelerator can achieve.\n2. Once this \\~speed is achieved, continue to apply the force for another 1 minute. The particle should gain negligible speed during this 1 minute, but should gain a lot of momentum (per momentum formula)\n3. Now stop the accelerating force and start an equal slowing force. I.e. reverse the force.\n\nPer the current (infinite mass/momentum) explanation, 1 minute of slowing should reduce the speed by negligible \u2013 same speed that was gained during last 1 minute of acceleration. Because force is rate of change of momentum and same force in both directions should cause same change of momentum/speed during same amount of time.\n\nBut per my explanation, a lot more slowing down will take place during the 1 minute because gamma becomes zero for slowing down.\n\nI think evidence and results of such experiment being done, can answer this question definitively.

This means that instead of the particle gaining energy at the expense of the field, the field gains energy at the expense of the particle.

The deceleration process in an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) is symmetric to the acceleration process in a standard linear accelerator. The math and physics governing both processes are the same, with the only difference being the phase of the applied electromagnetic field. In both cases, relativistic particles exhibit very little coordinate acceleration in the lab frame due to their high velocity.

You could also use `chained_integers = list(map(int, chained))` and print the `chained_integers` before proceeding if you want to double\\-check that.\n\nAnd finally to `reduce` it I would actually use the built\\-in `sum` function:\n\n```\nreduced = sum(chained_integers)  # or \"reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, chained_integers)\"\n\n```\n\nOr the one\\-line\\-version:\n\n```\nsum(map(int, itertools.chain(num, num2, num3)))\n\n```\n\nAn alternative solution using a comprehension instead of `map`:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven simpler would be a comprehension (in this case I used a generator expression) instead of the `map`:\n\n```\nreduced = sum(int(v) for v in itertools.chain(num, num2, num3))\n\n```\n\nAn alternative solution using a generator function:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's pretty short and easy to understand but I would like to present another example of how to do it using your own generator function:\n\n```\ndef chain_as_ints(*iterables):\n    for iterable in iterables:\n        for item in iterable:\n            yield int(item)\n\n```\n\nAnd you could use it like this:\n\n```\nsum(chain_as_ints(num, num2, num3))\n\n```\n\nIn this case a generator function is not really necessary (and probably not advisable given the alternatives) I just wanted to mention it for completeness."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the following Python code:\n\n```python\nnum = [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]\nnum2 = [\"4\",\"5\",\"6\"]\nnum3 = [\"7\",\"8\",\"9\"]\n\nj = list(map(lambda x, y, z: int(x) and int(y) and int(z), num, num2, num3))\nprint(j)\nprint(reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, j))\n```\n\nWhat will be the output of this code?\n\nA) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   45\n\nB) [7, 8, 9]\n   24\n\nC) [147, 258, 369]\n   774\n\nD) [1, 5, 9]\n   15\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe map function with multiple iterators processes the iterables simultaneously. In this case, it applies the lambda function to each set of corresponding elements from num, num2, and num3.\n\nThe lambda function `int(x) and int(y) and int(z)` converts each string to an integer, but due to the behavior of the 'and' operator in Python, it returns the last truthy value. So for each iteration, it returns:\n\n1st iteration: int(\"1\") and int(\"4\") and int(\"7\") = 7\n2nd iteration: int(\"2\") and int(\"5\") and int(\"8\") = 8\n3rd iteration: int(\"3\") and int(\"6\") and int(\"9\") = 9\n\nThus, j becomes [7, 8, 9].\n\nThe reduce function then sums these values: 7 + 8 + 9 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n[7, 8, 9]\n24"}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/24", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/281393", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/159842/"], "docs_id": 281393, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two variables speed and vibration and you can see that speed causes vibration.

This means that the fit of the model will still be mostly dependent on the 'speed' variable.\n\nFrom looking at the very small portion of the data shown, *speed* does not appear to be a good predictor of *vibration*. There is a much larger difference between observations 3 and 4, than there is from observations 1 and 2\\. Can you provide more details about the quality of the regression fit?\n\nSecond, based on the plot, it appears that vibration fluctuates between a high negative value and a high positive value. Again, I can only see 6 rows, but my guess is that you really want to be measuring the *magnitude* of the vibration, not the actual measurement. Transforming this the vibration to the absolute value may provide a better fit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is analyzing vibration data in relation to machine speed. After fitting an ARIMA model with 'speed' as an external regressor, the engineer observes a poor fit between the model and the actual vibration data. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this poor fit?\n\nA) The ARIMA model is inappropriate for this type of data and a different time series model should be used instead.\n\nB) The vibration data should be transformed to its absolute value before modeling to better capture the magnitude of vibrations.\n\nC) The speed variable is not a good predictor of vibration, resulting in a poor regression fit that the ARIMA component cannot adequately correct.\n\nD) The autocorrelation in the data is too strong, causing the ARIMA model to fail in capturing the time series dynamics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The poor fit is most likely due to the speed variable not being a good predictor of vibration. The question states that there's a much larger difference in vibration between observations 3 and 4 than between 1 and 2, despite relatively small changes in speed. This suggests a weak relationship between speed and vibration. Since the model is essentially a regression with ARIMA errors, a poor underlying regression will result in a poor overall fit, regardless of the ARIMA component's performance. While options B and D offer potential improvements, they don't address the core issue of the weak relationship between the predictor and response variables."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/07", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/357395", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/204765/"], "docs_id": 357395, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Trying to find an antonym for the verb \"nourish\", specifically in the context of depleting nutrients.

The Charge Bar encourages you to use normal attacks, as it the fastest way for you to charge them and improve the effectiveness of the your Active Skills, where you have to manage your limited mana pool. \n\nThe amount of damage that you need to inflict to fill your charge bar scales with your level. If a low DPS weapon for your level will charge slower than a high DPS weapon for your level.\n\nThere are Active Skills such as the Embermage's Blazing Pillar (not entirely accurate skill, but good for building charge in grouped up mobs) that builds your charge at a faster rate, and there are skills that don't accumulate any charge (e.g. Magma Mace, Firebombs, Firestorm, and Hailstorm).\n\nEach Charge Bar for each class works in a different manner:\n\n![Berserker Charge Bar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uarJj.jpg)\n\nWith Berserker, when it's full, you will enter the frenzied state. You will run faster, attack faster, and always crit until the frenzy ends. It's worth noting that the frenzied state countdown doesn't begin until you hit something (after it's been filled up). You could potentially beat up that practice dummy in town to get your frenzied boost and then port into your destination and start the fight with a boost. The charge starts decaying a few seconds after combat and drains at a slower rate than the Outlander's charge bar.\n\n![Outlander Charge Bar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FJYIX.jpg)\n\nThe Outlander's charge bar works a bit differently compared to the other classes. As you fill it up, you will get the passive bonuses (Up to \\+10% Cast Spd, \\+ 10% Dodge, \\+10% Crit, \\+10% Atk Spd) you get. There doesn't seem to be a break point threshold for each \\+X% bonus gain. The more damage you do, the charge increases, but it's also constantly decaying, so it's pobably the slowest to fill out of all the classes. Filling up the gauge up has no particular effect unlike the other classes. Additionally, it's worth noting that an Outlander with no charge will deal additional damage and stun the next enemy unit they hit. This bonus stacks with bonuses from shotgunnes.\n\n![Engineer Charge Bar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vi0cP.jpg)\n\nThe Engineer's charge bar has specific charge points (up to 5\\) and that a large number of their abilities use up in order to activate, and/or are more powerful (longer range/more damage) based on how many charges you have. The bar fills and drains much like the Outlanders, but a charge point seems to stay full longer after the charge point has been completely filled.\n\n![Embermage Charge Bar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9W29P.jpg)\n\nEmbermages are very straight forward, when the gauge fills up, the Embermage goes into a concentration state (for 12 seconds) where all skills cost no Mana and they do 25% more damage on top of any bonuses (tiered, passives, etc.) they've invested in.

It could be in the form `[north, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw]` going clockwise around, so number 6 on the image above would be `[False, True, True, False, False, False, True, True]`. I need a function/algorithm that can take in one of these lists, and output whether the square is removable or not. Here are examples from the above images.\n\n```\n[True, False, False, False, False, False, True, False] -> False (not removable)\n[True, False, False, False, False, False, True, True] -> True (removable)\n[True, False, True, False, False, False, True, True] -> False\n[True, True, True, False, False, False, True, True] -> True\n[True, True, True, False, True, False, True, True] -> False\n[False, True, True, False, False, False, True, True] -> False\n\n```\n\nIf it works better, the bools can be variables like `north` or `southeast`.\n\nMy first thought was to check the cardinal directions, and if there are only two squares in our group, then it isn't removable. This works for examples 1, 4, and 6, but gets 2, 3 and 5 wrong. I know the algorithm needs to take diagonals into account, because 1 and 2 are the same only including cardinal directions.\n\nHow can I make an algorithm that tells me whether or not a square is removable from the group without causing disconnection?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With help from a few comments, I realized that all I have to do was check to see if the surrounding squares are touching each other. I noticed a pattern with my bool lists above \\- if there is more than one chain/streak of `True`'s (including carrying over between start and end of the list), then removing the square will cause a disconnected group. If there is more than one streak of `True`'s, (checked by `longest_true_chain != num_trues`), then the surrounding squares are not connected and the square is not removable.\n\nHere is my python code\n\n```py\ndef removable(bool_list):\n    num_trues = bool_list.count(True)\n    longest_true_chain = 0\n    current_true_chain = 0\n    for b in bool_list*2:  # use *2 to include streaks carrying across nw to n (end to beginning of list)\n        if b:\n            current_true_chain += 1\n        else:\n            longest_true_chain = max(longest_true_chain, current_true_chain)\n            current_true_chain = 0\n    longest_true_chain = max(longest_true_chain, current_true_chain)\n    return longest_true_chain >= num_trues\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given a 3x3 grid representing the surroundings of a square in a larger connected group, which of the following boolean lists (representing the presence of squares in the order [N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW]) indicates that the center square can be removed without disconnecting the group?\n\nA) [True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False]\nB) [True, True, False, False, True, True, False, False]\nC) [True, True, True, False, False, False, True, True]\nD) [True, False, True, True, True, False, True, False]\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe key to determining if a square can be removed is to check if there's only one continuous chain of True values in the boolean list (including wrap-around from end to start).\n\nA) This list has multiple separate True chains, so removing the center square would disconnect the group.\nB) This list also has multiple separate True chains, so removing the center square would disconnect the group.\nC) This list has only one continuous chain of True values (wrapping from the end to the start), so removing the center square would keep the group connected.\nD) This list has multiple separate True chains, so removing the center square would disconnect the group.\n\nThe correct answer (C) represents a configuration where all the surrounding squares that are part of the group are connected to each other, forming a single chain around the center square.

The JSX includes both the button and conditional rendering of the fetched data.\n4. The data is only displayed after it has been fetched and the state has been updated.\n\nOption A incorrectly tries to return JSX from within the promise chain, which doesn't update the component's render.\nOption C uses a local variable instead of state, which won't trigger a re-render when updated.\nOption D fetches data on component mount (using useEffect) rather than on button click, and doesn't include a button in the render."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/15", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/21144", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 21144, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a phrase for \"the first thing I want to see in the morning as I wake up\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without a sentence with context, I'd venture \"rays of sunshine\""}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In literature and poetry, what literary device is most likely being employed when an author describes \"rays of sunshine\" as \"the first thing I want to see in the morning as I wake up\"?\n\nA) Metonymy\nB) Synecdoche\nC) Personification\nD) Synesthesia\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) Metonymy is correct.

Each mass will be described by a four vector $(E,p\\_x,p\\_y,p\\_z)$ where E is the energy of the mass and **$p$** the momentum.

Almost immediately $M\\_2$ will be within the $M\\_1$ mass and will not be sensitive to the attraction, as it will be within the expanding sphere of the photons.\n\nThought experiments need consistent frames .\n\n> Maybe it takes 2 light years for a body to register the presence of another body that is 2 light years away,\n\nFor interactions to happen ,yes it takes the time of the velocity of light to have an effect.

I know some category theory (at the level of Simmons) and differential and Riemannian geometry (at the level of Lee's series) but I don't have any background in categorical logic or model theory.\n\nI've recently come across some interesting [surveys](http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/sdg-pizza-seminar.pdf) and articles on synthetic differential geometry (SDG) that made the approach seem very appealing. Many of the definitions become very elegant, such as the definition of the tangent bundle as an exponential object. The ability to argue rigorously using infinitesimals also appeals to the physicist in me, and seems to yield more intuitive proofs.\n\nI just have a few questions about SDG which I hope some experts could answer. How much of modern differential geometry (Cartan geometry, poisson geometry, symplectic geometry, etc.) has been reformulated in SDG? Have any physical theories such as general relativity been reformulated in SDG? If so, is the synthetic formulation more or less practical than the classical formulation for computations and numerical simulations?\n\nAlso, how promising is SDG as an area of research? How does it compare to other alternative theories such as the ones discussed in [comparative smootheology](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/comparative_smootheology.html)? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One point of [synthetic differential geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+differential+geometry) is that, indeed, it is \"synthetic\" in the spirit of traditional [synthetic geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic%20geometry) but refined now from incidence geometry to differential geometry. Hence the name is rather appropriate and in particular highlights that SDG is more than any one of its models, such as those based on formal duals of [C\\-infinity rings](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+algebra) (\"[smooth loci](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+locus)\"). Indeed, traditional algebraic geometry with [formal schemes](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/formal%20scheme) is another model for SDG and this is where the origin of the theory lies: William Lawvere was watching Alexander Grothendieck's work and after abstracting the concept of [elementary topos](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topos) from what Grothendieck did with sheaves, he next abstracted the [Kock\\-Lawvere axioms](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kock-Lawvere%20axiom) of SDG from what Grothendieck did with [infinitesimal extensions](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinitesimal+extension), formal schemes and [crystals](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/crystal)/[de Rham spaces](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/de%20Rham%20space). The idea of SDG is to abstract the essence of all these niceties, formulate them in terms of elementary topos theory, and hence lay mathematical foundations for differential geoemtry that are vastly more encompassing than either algebraic geometry or traditional differential geometry alone. For instance there are also models in [supergeometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+differential+supergeometry), in complex analytic geometry and in much more exotic versions of \"differential calculus\" (such as Goodwillie calculus, see below).\n\nRegarding applications, a curious fact that remains little known is that Lawvere, while widely renowned for his work in the foundations of mathematics, has from the very beginning and throughout the decades been directly motivated by, actually, laying foundations for continuum physics. See [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/William%20Lawvere#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysics) for commented list of pointers and citations on that aspects. In particular SDG was from the very beginning intended to formalize mechanics, that's why one of the earliest texts on the topic is titled \"[Toposes of laws of motion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Toposes+of+laws+of+motion)\" (referring to SDG toposes).\n\nA little later Lawvere tried another approach to such foundations, not via the KL\\-axioms this time, but via \"[axiomatic cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive%20topos)\". One may recover SDG in axiomatic cohesion in a way that realizes it in close parallel to modern [D\\-geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/D-geometry) with axiomatic [de Rham stacks](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/de+Rham+space), jet\\-bundles, D\\-modules and all. I like to call this [differential cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/differential%20cohesion) but of course it doesn't matter what one calls it.\n\nViewed from this perspective the scope of models for the SDG axiomatics becomes more powerful still. For instance [Goodwille tangent calculus](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Goodwillie%20calculus) is now also part of the picture, in terms of synthetic [tangent cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tangent+cohesion). Another model is in spectral derived geometry that knows about structures of relevance in arithmetic geometry, chromatic homotopy theory and class field theory, this is discussed at *[differential cohesion and idelic structure](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/differential%20cohesion%20and%20idelic%20structure)*.\n\nAll this synthetic reasoning is maybe best viewed from the general perspective that it is useful in mathematics to stratify all theory as much as possible by the hierarchy of assumptions and axioms needed, try to prove as much as possible from as little assumptions as necessary and pass to fully concrete models only at the very end. If you are interested only in one specific model, such as derived geometry over $C^\\\\infty$\\-rings, then such synthetic reasoning may offer some guidance but might otherwise seem superfluous. The power of the synthetic method is in how it allows to pass between models, see their similarities and differences, and prove model\\-independent theorems. As in \"I don\u2019t want you to think all this is theory for the sake of it, or rather for the sake of itself. It\u2019s theory for the sake of other theory.\" ([Lurie, ICM 2010](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/08/31/icm2010-spielman-csornyei-lurie/)) Synthetic geometry is \"inter\\-geometric\", to borrow a term\\-formation from Mochizuki. If you run into something like the [function field analogy](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/function%20field%20analogy) then it may be time to step back and ask if such analogy between different flavors of geometry maybe comes from the fact that they all are models for the same set of \"synthetic\" axioms."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best characterizes the relationship between synthetic differential geometry (SDG) and other areas of mathematics and physics?\n\nA) SDG is primarily focused on reformulating classical differential geometry using infinitesimals, with little connection to other mathematical fields.\n\nB) SDG is a purely theoretical construct with no practical applications in physics or other sciences.\n\nC) SDG provides a unifying framework that encompasses various geometric approaches, including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and has connections to physics and other mathematical fields.\n\nD) SDG is limited to smooth manifolds and cannot be applied to more exotic mathematical structures or physical theories.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the passage emphasizes that SDG is a synthetic approach that unifies various geometric perspectives. It originated from abstracting concepts in algebraic geometry (such as formal schemes) and traditional differential geometry. SDG has connections to physics, as it was motivated by laying foundations for continuum physics. The framework of SDG is broad enough to encompass models in supergeometry, complex analytic geometry, and even more exotic versions of differential calculus like Goodwillie calculus. Additionally, SDG relates to other areas such as topos theory, cohesion, and even has implications for arithmetic geometry and chromatic homotopy theory.

The more gear reduction you have the slower the motor will turn but with higher torque.\n\nWhen using a gearbox you are trading motor speed for torque. It is quite simple calculating the RPM from the reduction ratio. Assuming you motor spins at 500 RPM and your gear is 1:46 then the motor with gear will spin at 500/46 \\= 10\\.86RPM.\nIn stepper motors it is not so simple to determine what is the motor top speed as it depends on the voltage you use, the driver (better drivers can drive the motor faster) and the quality of the motor. It is also important to know that stepper motors have different torques in different RPMS and \"Usually\" (but not always) the slower you go the more torque you have.\n\nGearbox does not affect the motor life no mater what is the gear ratio.

To calculate the output speed, we divide the motor's maximum speed by the gear reduction ratio: 600 RPM / 50 = 12 RPM. This gearbox setup trades speed for torque, meaning it increases the output torque while decreasing the maximum speed. The increased gear reduction also typically improves positioning precision. Option B and D have incorrect speed calculations. Option C correctly calculates the speed but incorrectly states the effects on torque and precision."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/24", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4037740", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/790294/"], "docs_id": 4037740, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to prove $\\\\lim\\\\limits\\_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} x \\\\sin^2 x$ does not exist, and request your help verifying my argument is correct.

They actually are rich domains in a bizarre way. But the business rules are all about updating the DB and the the domain language is SQL. That's wonderful if your domain expert is a DBA.\n\nbut neither of those are the same as either of these:\n\n* **Behavior objects** are methods that are clustered around either some state that makes them change together or simply the fact that they need to be moved around together. Some have no state at all and that's just fine. A nice handy bag of functions. What they had always better be clustered around is that they are used together. That they abstract an idea together. They should cluster around a single responsibility. Some behavior objects cluster around business rules. Not all.\n\nthose contrast with\n\n* **Value objects** (like ints, strings, stacks, queues, lists, and pretty much anything with getters) are bags of data that generally do not care about their values. They provide methods that expose their data or measure it in some way but they carefully avoid making behavior decisions based on their data.\n\nWhere you've gone wrong is you've somehow got the idea that a rich domain can't have value objects and that an anemic one can't have behavior objects. Which is just silly. Sure, using nothing but value objects makes it hard to have business rules (heck it makes it hard to do anything) but lovers of anemic domains certainly don't need to swear off behavior objects to keep their domain anemic. \n\n> Is there a pattern name for domain models that contain behaviour and little or no state?\n\nFunctional programming?
