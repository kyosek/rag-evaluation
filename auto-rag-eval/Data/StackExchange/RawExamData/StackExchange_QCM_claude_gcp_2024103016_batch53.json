Which of the following tools is best suited for this task, and why?\n\nA) Cron job scheduled every minute\nB) inoticoming daemon\nC) incron system\nD) Manual execution of the script\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) While a cron job scheduled every minute could potentially catch new file creations quickly, it's not efficient and doesn't directly respond to file system events. It would unnecessarily run even when no files are created.\n\nB) inoticoming is a daemon that can watch directories and trigger actions based on file system events. However, it's primarily designed for specific file names and is often used for tasks like repository management. It's not as flexible or user-friendly for general file creation events.\n\nC) incron (inotify cron) is the best tool for this scenario. It's specifically designed to respond to file system events rather than time-based schedules. incron allows users to set up tables (similar to crontab) that define actions to be taken when specific file system events occur, such as file creation. It uses the Linux Kernel inotify syscalls, making it efficient and responsive. Additionally, it provides user-level configuration similar to cron, allowing each user to edit their own incron tables.\n\nD) Manual execution of the script is not an automated solution and doesn't meet the requirement of triggering the script automatically when a new file is created.\n\nThe incron system provides the most appropriate and efficient solution for automatically running a maintenance script in response to new file creations in a directory."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/15", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/391015", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/225616/"], "docs_id": 391015, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have started using Ubuntu and I'm very impressed by it's performance.

Some municipalities may require one be installed so that the municipality's water system does not receive back pressure caused by the expansion of water when heated.\n* Use of backflow prevention devises. When using a backflow devise, as may be required by some codes/bylaws, the pressure caused by the expansion of water when heated may cause the temperature and pressure relieve valve on the tank to open. This is not always the case as it depends on multiple variables.\n\nLocation of expansion tanks on domestic systems:\n================================================\n\nWhen required, the expansion tank is located on the cold feed to the water heater after the shutoff valve.

This is necessary when a backflow prevention device is present because:\n\n1. It prevents back pressure on the municipal water system caused by water expansion when heated.\n2.

The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials says that we can write any symmetric polynomial of the roots of a polynomial as a polynomial of its coefficients. We can apply this to the characteristic polynomial of a matrix $A$ to write any symmetric polynomial of eigenvalues as a polynomial in the entries of $A$.\n\nI stumbled upon an explicit formula for this. Let $A$ be an $n \\\\times n$ matrix and $a\\_1, \\\\dots, a\\_n$ be its eigenvalues. Then we have the following identity, provided the left hand side is a symmetric polynomial:\n\n$$\n\\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n} p\\_i a\\_1^{i\\_1} \\\\cdots a\\_n^{i\\_n} \\= \\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n} p\\_i \\\\det(A\\_1^{i\\_1}, \\\\dots, A\\_n^{i\\_n})\n$$\n\nThe determinant $\\\\det(A\\_1^{i\\_1}, \\\\dots, A\\_n^{i\\_n})$ on the right hand side is the determinant of a matrix with those column vectors, where $A\\_i^k$ is the $i$\\-th column of the $k$\\-th power of $A$. The left hand side is a symmetric polynomial of the eigenvalues of $A$, and the right hand side is a polynomial of the entries of $A$.\n\nExample: if $A$ is a $2\\\\times 2$ matrix, then $$a\\_1 a\\_2^2 \\+ a\\_1^2 a\\_2 \\= \\\\det(A\\_1, A\\_2^2\\) \\+ \\\\det(A\\_1^2, A\\_2\\)$$\n\nProof. Let $p(A) \\\\in End(\\\\bigwedge^n V^\\*)$ be given by $p(A)f(v\\_1,\\\\dots,v\\_n) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n}f(A^{i\\_1}v\\_1,\\\\dots,A^{i\\_n}v\\_n)$. We have $End(\\\\bigwedge^n V^\\*) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{R}$ and $p(A)$ is the right hand side of the identity under this isomorphism. Since $p(A)$ was defined basis independently, the right hand side is basis independent, and we get the left hand side in the eigenbasis. $\\\\Box$\n\n[Link to detailed proof and slight generalization to an identity on several commuting matrices.](http://julesjacobs.github.io/pdf/sympoly.pdf) E.g. for commuting $2\\\\times 2$ matrices $A,B$:\n\n$$a\\_1 b\\_1 a\\_2^2 \\+ a\\_1^2 a\\_2 b\\_2 \\= \\\\det(AB\\_1, A\\_2^2\\) \\+ \\\\det(A\\_1^2, AB\\_2\\)$$\n\nThis identity looks like it should be a few hundred years old, especially since the proof is quite simple, but I have not seen this in linear algebra courses. Is this a well known identity? Where should I look to learn more about these types of identities? Or, maybe I am mistaken and the identity is false? (though I have also empirically tested it with a [computer program](https://pastebin.com/raw/wFGJ54WZ)) I apologize if this question is too basic for mathoverflow; I am only doing pure mathematics for fun. I initially asked elsewhere but was advised to ask here. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not a reference, but a short proof.\n\nWe use the following (probably known, but see later) lemma on representing a symmetric tensor as a linear combination of rank\\-1 symmetric tensors.\n\n**Lemma.** Let $A$ be a finite set, $K$ an infinite field. Denote by $\\\\mathcal S$ the set of symmetric functions $p:A^n\\\\to K$. Then $\\\\mathcal S$ is the $K$\\-span of rank\\-one functions, that is, the functions of the type $h(x\\_1\\)h(x\\_2\\)\\\\ldots h(x\\_n)$, where $h:A\\\\to K$.\n\n**Proof.** Note that the product of two rank\\-one functions is a rank\\-one function. Thus the linear space $\\\\mathcal T$, generated by rank\\-one functions, coincides with the $K$\\-algebra generated by them.\n\nWe may suppose that $A\\\\subset K$. For $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$ denote $e\\_k(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n)$ the elementary symmetric polynomial, that is, $\\\\varphi\\_t(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n):\\=\\\\prod(1\\+tx\\_i)\\=\\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^n t^ke\\_k$. We identify $e\\_k$ and the corresponding element of $\\\\mathcal S$. Choosing $n\\+1$ distinct values $t\\_1,\\\\ldots,t\\_{n\\+1}\\\\in K$ and solving the corresponding (Vandermonde's) linear system of equations we represent each $e\\_k$ as a linear combinations of $\\\\varphi\\_{t\\_i}\\\\in \\\\mathcal T$. Thus $e\\_k\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ for all $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$. It is well known that $e\\_k$'s generate the algebra of symmetric polynomials (over any field). Thus any symmetric polynomial function belongs to $\\\\mathcal T$. It remains to note that any symmetric function $f\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ may be represented by a symmetric polynomial. Indeed, a symmetric function $f$ may be represented as $F(e\\_1,e\\_2,\\\\ldots,e\\_n)$ for certain function function $F$ defined on the corresponding finite set (because the values of $e\\_1,\\\\ldots,e\\_n$ determine the values of $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n$ up to permutation). $F$ in turn coincides with a polynomial function on this finite set. $\\\\square$\n\nNow we may prove your theorem for finitely supported function $i\\\\mapsto p\\_i$. Due to Lemma it may be supposed to have the form $p\\_i\\=\\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^n H(i\\_k)$ for a certain finitely supported function $H$ on $\\\\mathbb{N}$ (as OP, I denote here $\\\\mathbb{N}\\=\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots\\\\}$). In this case both parts of your identity are equal to $\\\\det (\\\\sum\\_m H(m)A^m)$.\n\n**Comment.** Lemma does not hold for finite fields. For example, if $A\\=K\\=\\\\{0,1\\\\}$. Then the function $x\\+y\\+z$ is not a linear combination of rank\\-one functions 1, $xyz$, $(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$: if $x\\+y\\+z\\=a\\+bxyz\\+c(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$, then for $y\\=0,z\\=1,x\\=a$ we get $0\\=1$. I must make a warning that in the subject\\-related paper \"Symmetric tensors and symmetric tensor rank\" by Pierre Comon, Gene Golub, Lek\\-Heng Lim, Bernard Mourrain (SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 2008, 30 (3\\), pp.1254\\-1279\\) this statement, after equation (1\\.1\\), is stated for any field, although proved for complex numbers, and the proof uses that a non\\-zero polynomial has non\\-zero values.\n\nIn any case, you may always enlarge the ground field and safely think that it is infinite."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider an n \u00d7 n matrix A with eigenvalues a\u2081, ..., a\u2099.

Let's also let the problem of stopping traffic after the VPN fails to [this related, but different question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/33453/how-to-ensure-that-all-traffic-goes-through-vpn-connection-at-all-times).\n\nI look at this problem as a user centric solution and not something that's easily accomplished by modifying the OS X behavior.\n\nSet up two accounts on your Mac (neither need be admin accounts, but if either is, you won't need a third account to change system settings).\n\n1. A shell account that exists to run nothing and only establish the VPN connection.\n2. A main account that will run the programs you wish to ensure only get access to the network once it has been properly secured with a VPN.\n\nSo, with fast user switching enabled, you can log out of the main account. This ensures that no programs or processes from that user will continue running in the background. Most OS X apps are well behaved, and suspend network access when they don't have an active window on\\-screen, but you'd have to monitor and test this forever to be sure nothing is happening \\- logging out is simpler to maintain.\n\nNow, you could also replace \"account\" above with OS and run a virtualization system like Fusion (or Parallels or any other) and only start the guest OS once the host OS has secured everything on a VPN. Depending on the VM software you choose, you also may have control over the network and can turn on and off access even when the guest OS (or OSes) are running. This is basically simulating the extra hardware I initially said I wouldn't consider.\n\nI hope this shows one way you could be more secure while traveling and using a network that you don't trust while minimizing the risk that this will always entail.

Then,\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i}{\\\\Pi\\_{i\\\\in S} b\\_i}\\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\\\cdot e^{\\-\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i/K} \\\\leq \\\\max\\_x H(x)\\=K/e.\n$$\nThus, the original problem maximized if and only if there exists a subset $S$ such that $\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\=K$, which is the solution to the **Partition** problem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the optimization problem:\nGiven n pairs of positive reals (a_i, b_i) for i = 1 to n, choose a subset S \u2286 [n] to maximize:\n(\u2211(i\u2208S) a_i) / (\u220f(i\u2208S) b_i)\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the computational complexity and solvability of this problem?\n\nA) The problem can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming.\nB) The problem is NP-complete and can be reduced from the Partition problem.\nC) The problem has a greedy algorithm solution with O(n log n) time complexity.\nD) The problem is in P and can be solved using linear programming techniques.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The problem is indeed NP-complete and can be reduced from the Partition problem. The proof outline provided in the documentation shows how to transform an instance of the Partition problem into this optimization problem. By setting b_i = e^(a_i/K) where K is half the sum of all a_i, the optimization problem achieves its maximum if and only if there exists a subset S that sums to exactly K, which is equivalent to solving the Partition problem. Since Partition is known to be NP-complete, this reduction proves that our optimization problem is at least as hard as Partition, making it NP-complete as well.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if a polynomial-time dynamic programming solution existed, the problem would be in P, contradicting its NP-completeness (assuming P \u2260 NP).\n\nOption C is incorrect as a greedy algorithm cannot guarantee an optimal solution for this NP-complete problem.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the problem is NP-complete, not in P (assuming P \u2260 NP), and cannot be directly solved using linear programming due to its non-linear objective function and the discrete nature of subset selection."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/30", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/530762", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/333312/"], "docs_id": 530762, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Title says it all, every time I shut down I have to rerun `xinput --set-prop 11 \"Synaptics Finger\" 10 15 100` again is there any way to fix this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I had the exact same issue.

Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> But if there is two 'first photon' which is not coherence each other, then after some actions(induced emissions) there will be two family of photons inside of laser.\n\nThis is entirely normal. The \"first photons\" that start the laser action are generated by spontaneous emission. They are not coherent with each other, and there are normally more than one present in the cavity at a time.\n\n> how can we make two incoherent families of photons coherent and make real laser?\n\nWhat happens is, each time a photon from group \"1\" stimulates a new emission, that puts the excited atom involved back to the ground state. This reduces the number of excited atoms available to provide gain for group \"2\". \n\nThis produces a kind of positive feedback mechanism so that if group \"1\" has slightly more photons than group \"2\", then group \"1\" will quickly starve group \"2\" of gain, and group \"1\" will come to dominate. \n\nThis is related to the *gain pinning* effect. If you increase the pump power of a laser above the threshold level, typically this doesn't increase the population inversion, because stimulated emission increases and the excited population is locked at the threshold level (while output power increases). This means the gain spectrum is also \"pinned\" at the threshold level, so if the group \"1\" photons have a frequency at the peak of the gain spectrum, but group \"2\" are slightly off the peak, then group \"2\" will not have sufficient gain to overcome the cavity loss and will quickly die away.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that group \"1\" and \"2\" are not interacting with exactly the same set of atoms in the gain medium. For example, if group \"1\" are in a different spatial mode than group \"2\" so that they overlap a different part of the gain material.

In a laser cavity, when two incoherent groups of photons are present, the group with slightly more photons will stimulate more emissions. This depletes the population of excited atoms available for the other group, creating a positive feedback mechanism. As a result, one group (usually the one that started with more photons or is closer to the peak of the gain spectrum) will quickly dominate, leading to coherent laser output.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the photons don't interfere destructively in this way. Answer B is incorrect because cavity mirrors don't selectively reflect only one group of photons based on their coherence.

The excitation is the voltage you put into a load cell in order to\nget an output from it.\n2. The load cell's sensitivity is the ratio of its output to its input, stated in units of \"millivolts\\[of output] per volt\"\\[of input], with the full\\-scale\nrated mechanical load on the load cell.\n\nWhat that means is that if you have a load cell rated for 1000kg full\\-scale and it exhibits a sensitivity of 2 millivolts per volt, with an excitation of 10 volts it'll put out 20 millivolts when there's 1000kg sitting on it. With 500kg sitting on it and 10 volts of excitation it'll put out 10 millivolts, as it will with 5 volts of excitation and a 1000Kg load.\n\nAnd the rest of it:\n\nIn order to build up the tiny signal from the load cell into something that makes sense to feed into an ADC, you'll need to amplify that signal. \n\nThe gain of the amplifier will be determined by the ADC's full\\-scale input requirement and the Load cell's full\\-scale output, the relationship being:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\= \\\\frac{ADC\\_{\\\\ in}}{LOAD CELL\\_{\\\\ OUT}}, $$\n\nIn the case of a load cell with a 20mV output and an ADC with a 5 volt full\\-scale input, that gain would need to be:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\=\\\\frac {5V}{0\\.02V} \\= 250 $$ \n\nNow, for the nitty\\-gritty:)\n\nAfter all of that, if everything were perfect, 1000kg sitting on the load cell would result in an output of 11 1111 1111 from the ADC and 00 0000 0000 with no load on the load cell.\n\nThat's 1024 different states representing the range from zero to 1000 kg, so that range would resolve into 1024 increments of about 976\\.56 grams each, which would be the resolution of the system. \n\nIn the instrumentation world, \"offset\" means \"zero\" and span means \"gain\", so what you'll need to do to calibrate your system, once you have it all hooked up, is to make sure there's no mechanical load on the load cell, turn on the excitation supply, crank the span control up a little until you get a reading on the ADC, and wait a while until everything gets stable. Once it does, adjust the offset pot for zero, put 1000 kg on the load cell, and adjust the span control for a reading on the ADC which reflects the resolution you want. \n\nThat is, for maximum resolution set the reading to 11 1111 1111, but if you want to resolve the reading into, say, one kilogram steps for convenience downstream, set the reading to 01 1101 1000 and the count will increase by one LSB for every kilogram added to the load.

Maybe 1 out of 20 or 30 times.\n\nI do have an AuditTrail built in, which is my only guess as to what may be causing the problem.\n\nThe VBA on the form:\n\n```\nPrivate Sub Form_AfterDelConfirm(Status As Integer)\nIf Status = acDeleteOK Then Call AuditChanges(\"ApptID\", \"DELETED PRIOR RECORD\")\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub Form_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)\nIf Me.NewRecord Then\n    Call AuditChanges(\"ApptID\", \"NEW\")\nElse\n    Call AuditChanges(\"ApptID\", \"EDIT\")\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub Form_Delete(Cancel As Integer)\nIf Status = acDeleteOK Then Call AuditChanges(\"ApptID\", \"DELETE BUTTON HIT\")\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\nThe AuditTrail code is:\n\n```\nSub AuditChanges(IDField As String, UserAction As String)\nOn Error GoTo AuditChanges_Err\nDim cnn As ADODB.Connection\nDim rst As ADODB.Recordset\nDim ctl As Control\nDim datTimeCheck As Date\nDim strUserID As String\nSet cnn = CurrentProject.Connection\nSet rst = New ADODB.Recordset\nrst.Open \"SELECT * FROM AuditTrail\", cnn, adOpenDynamic, adLockOptimistic\ndatTimeCheck = Now()\n strUserID = Environ(\"USERNAME\")\nSelect Case UserAction\n    Case \"EDIT\"\n        For Each ctl In Screen.ActiveControl.Parent.Controls\n            If ctl.Tag = \"Audit\" Then\n                If Nz(ctl.Value) <> Nz(ctl.OldValue) Then\n                    With rst\n                        .AddNew\n                        ![DateTime] = datTimeCheck\n                        ![UserName] = strUserID\n                        ![FormName] = Screen.ActiveControl.Parent.Name\n                        ![Action] = UserAction\n                        ![RecordID] = Screen.ActiveControl.Parent.Controls(IDField).Value\n                        ![FieldName] = ctl.ControlSource\n                        ![OldValue] = ctl.OldValue\n                        ![NewValue] = ctl.Value\n                        .Update\n                    End With\n                End If\n            End If\n        Next ctl\n    Case Else\n        With rst\n            .AddNew\n            ![DateTime] = datTimeCheck\n            ![UserName] = strUserID\n            ![FormName] = Screen.ActiveControl.Parent.Name\n            ![Action] = UserAction\n            ![RecordID] = Screen.ActiveControl.Parent.Controls(IDField).Value\n            .Update\n        End With\nEnd Select\nAuditChanges_Exit:\nOn Error Resume Next\nrst.Close\ncnn.Close\nSet rst = Nothing\nSet cnn = Nothing\nExit Sub\nAuditChanges_Err:\nMsgBox Err.Description, vbCritical, \"ERROR!\"\nResume AuditChanges_Exit\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\nIf the error doesn't involve the VBA code, I have no idea what the problem could be.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I concur with dbmitch; adding some extra info to your error message would be a great help.\n\nIn addition, if that doesn't get you exactly what you want, you can also implement the little\\-known ERL function. Most people don't even know that Access can trap at the line level if they add line numbers (are you old enough to remember Basic?) to their code.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```\nSub AuditChanges(IDField As String, UserAction As String)\n10  On Error GoTo AuditChanges_Err\n\n20  Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection\n30  Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset\n40  Dim ctl As Control\n50  Dim datTimeCheck As Date\n60  Dim strUserID As String\n\n70  Set cnn = CurrentProject.Connection\n80  Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset\netc...\n\n```\n\nAnd then you could change your error handler to be something like:\n\n```\n400  MsgBox \"UserAction: \" & UserAction & vbCrLf & _\n        \"IDField: \" & IDField & vbCrLf & _\n        \"Error Line: \" & Erl & vbCrLf & _\n        \"Error: (\" & Err.Number & \") \" & Err.Description, vbCritical, \"ERROR!\"\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is experiencing intermittent errors in their Access database application.

When I was talking, I used the term \"code\" to refer to a Python program, and he told me that he didn't know what \"code\" was, that the correct term was \"algorithm\", and that \"code\" was something else.\n\nI really didn't know how to refute him because the way I see it is that a program can be an \"algorithm\". I used that term only when I was starting to program simple programs. The word I use most is \"code\", and on the internet, almost everyone else uses that term.\n\nWhen does something go from being an algorithm to being code, if it can change. Maybe it can be both at the same time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In short, while there are differences in the specific meaning of the words, that civil engineer was being needlessly pedantic and balking at you not using his preferred word. There was no justifiable reason to disrupt the flow of conversation other than them wanting to be a clever know\\-it\\-all.\n\n---\n\nArguing over the \"algorithm\" vs \"code\" moniker is like arguing whether what I'm sitting on right now is \"furniture\" or a \"chair\". These are not exact synonyms of one another and in some cases it can be one without being the other, but the specific designation really doesn't matter in scope of the current conversation.\n\nAn algorithm is [defined as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm):\n\n> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well\\-defined instructions for calculating a function. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.\n\nAll code is essentially an algorithm. It's a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to get the computer to do the thing you want it to do.\n\n**Can you have code that is not an algorithm?**\n\nPedants might argue that declarations (e.g. `public class Foo {}`) are not algorithms and only operations (e.g. `int c = b + a;` can be considered algorithms.\n\nI don't quite agree, as the declarations are essential to the *well\\-defined* nature of the instructions (as they define the data used in the operations). In essence, if your language's native definition of `int` is acceptable, then my custom definition of `class Foo` is as well. I see no reason to distinguish between the two in this regard.\n\n**Can you have an algorithm that is not code?**\n\nYes. Any set of calculation instructions is an algorithm. This could be a handwritten list of steps on how to e.g. calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (i.e. Pythagoras' theorem):\n\n> 1. Square the length of each leg.\n> 2. Add them together.\n> 3. Take the square root.\n\nThis is not code, but it is an algorithm.\n\nThe furthest stretch I could give in favor of that civil engineer's argument is that you could argue that a *compiled* application is still an algorithm but has ceased to be code. But I doubt you were specifically talking about a compiled file, given that Python is an interpreted language, at which point this argument doesn't even apply in the civil engineer's favor.\n\nAs an aside, while most definitions tend to restrict algorithms to the fields of mathematics and computer science, I personally see no reason why we couldn't consider e.g. a cooking recipe as an algorithm as well. It's still a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to achieve a specific predetermined outcome. But this is maybe a subjective argument and you might feel differently."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of computer programming, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between \"code\" and \"algorithm\"?\n\nA) Code and algorithm are completely distinct concepts that should never be used interchangeably.\n\nB) All code is an algorithm, but not all algorithms are code.\n\nC) All algorithms are code, but not all code is an algorithm.\n\nD) Code and algorithm are exact synonyms and can always be used interchangeably.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B: All code is an algorithm, but not all algorithms are code. This statement best captures the nuanced relationship between these two concepts as described in the documentation.\n\nCode, in the context of programming, is essentially a sequence of well-defined instructions for a computer to execute, which aligns with the definition of an algorithm. Therefore, all code can be considered an algorithm.\n\nHowever, algorithms can exist outside of code. The documentation provides an example of a handwritten list of steps to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using Pythagoras' theorem. This is an algorithm but not code, as it's not written in a programming language.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are differences between code and algorithms, they are closely related concepts and can often be used interchangeably in casual conversation about programming.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it reverses the correct relationship. As explained, all code is algorithmic, but not all algorithms are code.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while code and algorithm are closely related, they are not exact synonyms.

If so, then how did it became *v. \u2192 n.* from *adj. \u2192 adv.*? If not, where does it come from?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, \\-ment formed nouns in both Old French and Middle English. For instance, consider the etymology for *garment* (as on [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/garment) and crosschecked with the Oxford English Dictionary or OED). \n\n> c. 1400, \"any article of clothing,\" reduced form of garnement (early 14c.), from Old French garnement \"garment, attire, clothes\" (12c.), from garnir \"fit out, provide, adorn,\" from a Germanic source (compare garnish (v.)), from PIE root \\*wer\\- (4\\) \"to cover.\"\n\n*Garnement* in Old French (a noun) was formed from a verb \\+ \\-ment. This kind of formation from Old French *\\-ment* and Latin *\\-mentum* has several examples, including the French\\-derived words *habiliment, abridgement, accomplishment,* and *commencement*, and the Latin\\-derived words *fragment, aliment,* and *ornament*. ([\"\\-ment, *suffix*,\" OED](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116535)) \n\nSo both French and English allow for the formation of nouns from verbs with *\\-ment.* What's remarkable is that, from Old French to now, *\\-ment* could also form adverbs from adjectives, and this *didn't* carry over to English. The *[Oxford Guide to Etymology](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Guide_to_Etymology.html?id=l0kTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=ment%20mente&f=false)* (2009\\) summarizes its origin from the Latin ablative phrase '(adjective) mente,' which in English terms served as an adverbial: \n\n> Affixes often result from grammaticalization of adverbs or prepositions. For instance, the adverb\\-forming suffix *\\-ment* in French (and likewise Spanish *\\-mente*, Italian *\\-mente*, etc.) originates in uses of Latin *mens*, *ment\\-* in the ablative case in collocations such as *clara mente* 'with a clear mind'. Such collocations showed semantic broadening, e.g. 'clear manner of being or behaving' rather than simply 'with a clear mind', and the pattern became extended to adjectival bases which had no connection with mental activity, ultimately giving rise to a very productive adverb\\-forming suffix.\n\nWhy did the adverb\\-forming *\\-ment* not carry over to English while the noun\\-forming *\\-ment* did? There's no sure answer, but my training as a medievalist makes a hypothesis tempting. There are a few possible suffixes for forming nouns from verbs in each language because the semantic possibilities are broad, so *\\-ion* (procession), *\\-tion* (solution), *\\-er* (bidder), and others all form nouns from verbs with different senses and limitations; *\\-ment* fills a place in the Middle English system for aristocratic items as well as functions of government. (See *government*.) That incorporation fits the history of England in that period, which had French\\-derived legal institutions and a French\\-speaking aristocracy. Shortly after that point, the suffix was naturalized into English and widely applied to words irrespective of origin. (An early example is *onement*, meaning roughly concord or agreement.)\n\nHowever, one suffix tends to dominate adverb formation in each language: English has the Old English\\-derived *\\-ly* and French has the Old French\\-derived *\\-ment*. The suffixes are so widespread and actively used that there is little reason for the suffix to cross over."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The suffix \"-ment\" in English and French serves different grammatical functions.

A single photon may be emitted when an electron in an atom returns down to the ground state from an excited state. In a reciprocal event, such a photon could be subsequently absorbed by a similar atom causing an electron to jump from the ground state up to the excited state.   \n\nA single photon has a wavefunction associated with it. In the case of emission, the wavefunction suddenly appears in the vicinity of the atom and then radiates out from that source. In the case of absorption, the wavefunction may be initially present over a large volume but is said to suddenly disappear (collapse) at the instant the atom gets excited. Both these events are probabilistic and follow the rules of quantum mechanics.   \n\nIn most cases, physics runs equally well forwards or backwards. Presumably this applies to the emission of a photon by one atom and its absorption by a nearby atom. However the wavefunction description of this process is dramatically asymmetric in time. If I try to run it backwards, I see a wavefunction that abruptly appears in a large volume around one atom and then magically converges towards the other and disappears.   \n\nMaybe is just part of the mystery, but is there no quantum\\-mechanical description of such an event where the description itself has time\\-symmetry?\n\n\\[Edit]   \n\n**Quantum\\-mechanical example with spatial and time symmetry:**   \n\nFor what it's worth, the following picture shows a perfect ellipsoidal cavity with two atoms \\- one at each focus. This is a pathological case, but it does seem like the transfer of the excited state from one atom to the other would involve a time\\-symmetric evolution of the wave function.  \n\n[![symmetry between initialization and measurement?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Emission and absorption of a photon aren't instantaneous processes as long as you don't perturb the system by measuring its state. If you do, the system collapses in a non\\-reversible way. Let me explain how it evolves in the case you don't measure:\n\n### Spontaneous emission\n\nAn atom in the excited state $\\| a \\\\rangle$ emits light in the same spatial pattern as a [classical dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna):   \n\n[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HxfN.png \"Dipole emission pattern, Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg\")](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg)  \n\nAs you correctly state in your question the emission starts out from the position of the atom and moves away from it at the speed of light. Similar to an antenna which is not damped by electrical resistance, but only by the energy it loses due to radiation, the power it emits decays over time. For the case of the atom the state $\\| a, 0 \\\\rangle$ in which the atom is in the excited state and there is no photon present evolves towards the state in which the atom is in the ground state $\\| b \\\\rangle$ and there is a photon in a superposition of many modes with different wavevectors $\\\\vec{k}$. This happens smoothly:\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi (t) \\\\rangle \\= c\\_a (t) \\\\, \\| a, 0 \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\sum\\_{\\\\vec{k}} c\\_{b, \\\\vec{k}} (t) \\\\, \\| b, 1\\_{\\\\vec{k}} \\\\rangle\n$$\nThe temporal evolution is exponential, i.e. $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2 \\= e^{\\- \\\\Gamma t}$, so that after infinite time the atom is completely in the ground state and the photon is completely emitted. For a more rigorous description see the [Wigner\\-Weisskopf theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01336768) as described for example in [Scully \\& Zubairy \u2013 Quantum Optics (1997\\)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511813993) chapter 6\\.3\\.\n\n### Time\\-reversed spontaneous emission\n\nAll of the described evolution happens unitarily, hence it can happen backwards as well as forwards. If you have an atom in the ground state and prepare a photon in a spatial mode matching the emission pattern of the atom having the right temporal profile you can deterministically drive the atom into the excited state. This is described in [Stobi\u0144ska *et al.* EPL **86** (2009\\)](https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/86/14007). It is of course very difficult to do, because you need to focus the light from the full $4 \\\\pi$ solid angle onto the atom and find a way to shape the photon to an exponentially rising wavepacket.\n\n### Absorption of a spread\\-out photon\n\nComing back to the apparent paradox of your question: If the wavefunction of a photon is extended over a large area how does it excite the atom as if it was localized there? The answer is \"It doesn't.\". Like in the case of spontaneous emission the state of the overall system evolves in a superposition of the atom being in the ground state / the photon flying around and the atom being excited by the photon. Just that in the case of a photon not matching the spatio\\-temporal radiation pattern of the atom the probability of the atom being excited $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2$ is very low. So the majority of the wavefunction still describes a free\\-flying photon.\n\nOnly when you measure the state of the atom (or the presence of the photon) you force the system to be in either of the states. This is the moment when the whole spread\\-out photon collapses to be either absorbed or detected somewhere on a camera. The whole mystery is in the description of collapse due to measurement. But this is another topic, covered in questions like \"[Practically, how does an 'observer' collapse a wave function?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/509803/169454)\".\n\n### Is the absorption also a measurement?\n\nThere is a connection between the (partial) absorption of the photon and a projective measurement. By their interaction the atom and the photon become entangled, just like in more advanced collapse models the detector becomes entangled with the observed system. As an example consider an animal\\-friendly version of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat: A radioactive atom, which can trigger a detector and an experimentalist monitoring the detector. If the atom was alone it would evolve into a superposition of decayed and not decayed\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nIf you include the detector into the Hilbert space you can model the system of detector plus atom as an entangled state\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nInvolving the experimentalist as well then yields the state\n$$\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\|\\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector \\+ experimentalist}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\quad \\&\\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\n\\+ \\&\\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{no decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n\\\\end{align}\n$$\nBecause the experimentalist is part of the superposition, in each branch of the wavefunction it appears to the experimentalist as if the atom is now in a definite state \u2013 as if it had collapsed from the initial superposition.\n\nSo in the end the distinction between the atom and a macroscopic detector is artificial. But it's justified, because the atom can be coherently manipulated to unentangle it from the photon. For macroscopic systems like the detector (and experimentalist) this is pretty hopeless because they have too many degrees of freedom.\n\n### Absorption of a focused photon\n\nIn the case of the elliptic cavity the emission of atom $A$ is indeed reshaped to match the spatial emission pattern of atom $B$. Despite this the probability that atom $B$ absorbs the photon is still less than $1$, because the temporal profile of the emitted photon is exponentially decaying, while perfect absorption (time\\-reversed spontaneous emission) requires an exponentially rising profile.   \n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIP7N.png)   \n\nIf the cavity size is reduced such that the emission of the photon takes significatly longer than a round\\-trip of in the cavity, the excitation being initially in atom $A$ can be fully transfered to atom $B$ and vice versa.\n\nThe following is a simulation starting in the state\n$$\n\\| a\\_A \\\\rangle \\| b\\_B \\\\rangle \\| 0 \\\\rangle \\\\text{,}\n$$\ni.e. atom $A$ in the excited state, $B$ in the ground state and $0$ photons in the cavity.

Now this seems like a problem that should have been solved *decades* ago, and indeed \\- there's no shortage of logging libraries for any decent programming language. But while trying to choose among them I ran across a rather fundamental dilemma.\n\nDo I emphasize safety or performance?\n\nLet's look at both extremes. If I emphasize safety, then I should make sure that the log entry is safely stored before I proceed with work. Otherwise I could end up in a situation where my program thinks it's logged 5 log entries and has done substantial work, but then an error makes these entries disappear and later forensics turn up nonsensical results. \"I see that the program only logged up to point A, but there is already data stored which suggests it reached point B. Then where are the log entries between A and B?! What's going on here?!\" At the furthest extremes of safety this means that after I produce a log entry I also need to wait until it has been successfully flushed to physical storage. However that's a VERY expensive operation and would basically kill my program's performance, since every log call would probably take tens if not hundreds of milliseconds.\n\nOn the other extreme \\- performance. In this case I need to shove the log entry to wherever as fast as I can and move on without looking back. Another background process then can take said entry and try to write it to physical storage, but the main process is unaffected. The main risk here is the one mentioned before \\- it's easy to lose log entries if everything crashes and burns before they could be written out.\n\nAnd this whole thing is on a spectrum, of course. By employing various strategies you can make your chosen approach either safer (but slower) or faster (but riskier). And... I can't decide how to choose.\n\nIs there some commonly accepted middle ground? Has anyone every come up with a way of deciding where your particular situation should lie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For almost any kind of system, regardless if it is a small or a huge one, it is a good idea to follow the tactics\n\n**First make right, then make it fast!**\n----------------------------------------\n\n(and: don't optimize \"just in case\").\n\nLogging (especially when done for the purpose of post mortem analysis) usually needs to be complete and not to loose the final entries, so I would recommend heavily to always start with a solution which flushes each logged line immediately to disk. Otherwise the log could become pretty useless. \n\nNow, when you have added \"enough\" logging to your application, and when you actually experience a *real, measureable* performance hit, then (and only then) start thinking about optimizations. For most real\\-world applications, it is probably enough to have a switch for turning the logging on or off. Or, if that is not sufficient, a parameter to change the logging level (like \"minimal\", \"standard\", \"verbose\"). So one can make the decision of \"safety\" vs \"performance\" at run time.\n\nThere are definitely some systems for which is not sufficient (for example, when you observe hard\\-to\\-reproduce bugs only after some hours under production load, but cannot afford full \"debug\" logging in a production environment, or when you don't have a chance to restart the system easily in \"logging\" mode after a failure, like software for a black\\-box of an airplane). \n\nIf you are really developing such extraordinary software, you might have to think of further optimizations \\- like a background process which receives logging events and can write them buffered to disk even when the main program crashes, or whatever makes most sense for the particular kind of system you are developing. However, as always with optimizations, this has to done with in\\-depth knowledge of the requirements, the use cases and the system, there is no easy \"one\\-size\\-fits\\-all\" solution to this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is implementing logging in their application and is concerned about balancing safety and performance.

This approach prioritizes safety over initial performance concerns.\n\nThe answer suggests that optimizations should only be considered later if a real, measurable performance hit is experienced. Options A and C focus prematurely on performance optimization, which goes against the recommended approach. Option D, while potentially useful, is not suggested as the initial step but rather as a possible optimization if needed later.\n\nThe correct approach (B) ensures that logging is complete and reliable from the start, which is crucial for debugging and system analysis, particularly in the event of crashes or unexpected behavior."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/144986", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/66446/"], "docs_id": 144986, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had a system running 10\\.04, I think.

Depending on your data, this could lead to several clusters: high buildings, low buildings, surrounding landscape. There are some issues, for example, a high tree might be just as high as a low building. \n\nAlternatively, you could perform some kind of (un)supervised classification in which you could use the height information and possibly other source of information such as not only the height information at the current location, but also the surrounding height.\n\nOnce you've determined which area of the map could be classified as city, or urban area, you could provide statistics such as mean and variance to describe the height and variations in the height.\n\nWhich analysis works well also depends on which data you are going to use. Very high resolution LIDAR data supports other analysis than very coarse SRTM images. Also take care that some height products have compensated for buildings as they where not interested in them.\n\nThen there is the question of how to do this kind of analysis. I use R and other high level programming languages to do this. These tools have a steep learning curve, but provide ultimate flexibility.

According to tests by [BigClive](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigclivedotcom/videos) (sorry, I cannot recall exactly in which video he mentions this) some batteries can be completely discharged (0 Volts), charged again and then appear to still have their full capacity. Note that the \"fully discharged\" state did not last long (hours or days perhaps).\n\n*Lithium\\-ion batteries age*\n\nThat is true but also depends everything I mention above and also how you treat the battery. For example in some military applications Li\\-Ion cells are charged not up to 4\\.1 \\- 4\\.2 V (like in many consumer products) but to 3\\.8 V or less. This places less stress in the cells making them last longer.\n\n*but I assume Apple doesn't charge the devices to 100% anyway*\n\nThat will actually be the **battery manufacturer** producing the batteries in such a way that they are at around 40% to 60% charge when finished. They're not charged or discharged as that takes too long! The charge level can be set by using the proper ratios of chemicals during production. Same as non rechargeable batteries are made to have 100% charge.\n\nIf you want to store a device for some time, I suggest charging the battery to a value between 40% to 70 % (my rough estimate). Then if possible **remove** the battery! \n\nIf removing the battery is not possible make sure that the device is switched off and store it in a location where it cannot get very hot or cold.\n\nTo protect against fire and overcharging (when the charging circuit in a product breaks) nearly **any** device will have a battery protection circuit. This will simply disconnect the battery when the battery is in danger. I am quite sure Apple devices have this.\n\nBTW, this does not protect against manufacturing issues with batteries which is often the cause of batteries catching fire."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer leaves their lithium-ion powered device in a drawer at 3% charge for several months.

The answer states that some chargers have a \"wake-up\" or \"boost\" feature to reactivate batteries that have fallen into a deep discharge state.

It looks like you can pretty much handle any situation in SpatialJoin with sqlite dialect (with spatialite support) and ogr.DataSource.ExecuteSQL(...). See the docs on [OGR SQL](http://gdal.org/ogr_sql.html) and the [SQLite Dialect](http://gdal.org/ogr_sql_sqlite.html). All of spatialite's functions are available with sqlite and spatialite support enabled in the build.\n\n```\narcpy.da.SearchCursor()\n\n```\n\nThe cursor in arcpy, if I remember correctly, is a generic cursor for iterating over a feature set.

The documentation explains that when using an official title as a Proper Noun, it should be capitalized and used without \"the\" (e.g., \"Managing Director John Smith\"). This form treats the title like a name. On the other hand, when describing a person's job or position, \"the\" is used, and the description can be in lowercase (e.g., \"the managing director of the company, John Smith\"). This form is treating the title as a description rather than an official title.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"the\" is not always required, particularly with official titles used as Proper Nouns.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is a slight difference in meaning between using a title with or without \"the.\" Using it without \"the\" indicates an official title, while using it with \"the\" is more of a description.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it reverses the correct usage. Official titles often don't use \"the\" when used as Proper Nouns, while job descriptions typically do use \"the.\""}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/13", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/150066", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/20153/"], "docs_id": 150066, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have added in order count and last order date to the customer grid which is working fine, however it is not sortable or filterable in the grid.\n\nI have done some searching but can't seem to find a solution that makes any sense, can someone explain how I can achieve this?\n\n```\nprotected function _prepareCollection()\n{\n    $collection = Mage::getResourceModel('customer/customer_collection')\n        ->addNameToSelect()\n        ->addAttributeToSelect('email')\n        ->addAttributeToSelect('created_at')\n        ->addAttributeToSelect('group_id')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_postcode', 'customer_address/postcode', 'default_billing', null, 'left')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_city', 'customer_address/city', 'default_billing', null, 'left')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_telephone', 'customer_address/telephone', 'default_billing', null, 'left')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_region', 'customer_address/region', 'default_billing', null, 'left')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_country_id', 'customer_address/country_id', 'default_billing', null, 'left')\n        ->joinAttribute('billing_company', 'customer_address/company', 'default_billing', null, 'left');\n\n    $sql = 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_flat_order AS o WHERE o.customer_id=e.entity_id';\n\n    $expr = new Zend_Db_Expr('(' . $sql .

When a Windows 10 PC enters sleep mode, the system state is stored in RAM, which allows for faster resume times compared to hibernation. This is supported by the documentation which states that \"Sleep stores the state of your computer in RAM, and so resumes much faster; you'll be up and running in two to five seconds in some cases.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because WiFi is turned off during sleep mode, as mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because CPU power is reduced in sleep mode.

Future readers may find the code [at this page of the Celeste.jl project](https://github.com/jeff-regier/Celeste.jl/blob/bf4c0d668a4ba48c289318e6b782c1edea017914/src/KL.jl)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the USArrests dataset in R, which of the following statements best describes why this dataset is considered multivariate?\n\nA) It contains multiple response variables that are correlated with each other\nB) It has more than one explanatory variable influencing a single response variable\nC) It contains multiple variables that can be analyzed collectively without distinguishing between response and explanatory variables\nD) It shows clear collinearity between the response variables in the pairs plot\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The USArrests dataset is considered multivariate because it contains multiple variables (Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape) that can be analyzed collectively to understand patterns and relationships in the data. In this context, there isn't a clear distinction between response and explanatory variables. The question highlights a common misconception about multivariate data, which is that it necessarily requires correlated response variables. In reality, multivariate analysis can be performed on datasets with multiple variables without explicitly defining some as responses and others as predictors. The pairs plot shows relationships between variables but doesn't specifically indicate collinearity among response variables, as the roles of the variables are not predefined in this dataset."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/09", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3899804", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/841881/"], "docs_id": 3899804, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently I came across this problem:\n\nMathlete was 100 yards from the foot of a vertical rock climbing all and could spot Slowpoke at a 60\u00b0angle of elevation still on his way up the wall. Speedy reached the top of the wall and spotted his car on the ground at a 60\u00b0 angle of depression. The car was 425 yards from the foot of the wall. How many more yards up the wall did Slowpoke need to climb?(Assume that Mathlete, Slowpoke, Speedy, and the care are all on the same vertical plane perpendicular to the wall.)\n\nI'm having a really hard time drawing the diagram for this. For one, I'm not sure which angle they mean when they say elevation and depression, and the last part saying they are all on the same vertical plane perpendicular to the wall is really confusing me. I thought that Mathlete was on the ground and Speedy and Slowpoke are on the wall? I'd really appreciate it if someone could either provide me with a diagram or walk me through how to get one.

The wall forms a right triangle with the ground and the line of sight to Speedy's car.\n2. The height of the wall (736.6 yards) is opposite to the 60\u00b0 angle of depression to the car.\n3. Using tangent: tan(60\u00b0) = 736.6 / 425\n4. This smaller triangle is similar to the larger triangle formed by Mathlete, the wall, and Speedy's car.\n5. The distance from the wall to Mathlete (100 yards) plus the distance from the wall to the car (425 yards) gives the total distance between Mathlete and the car.\n\nTherefore, 100 + 425 = 525 yards.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it's only the distance from the wall to the car.\nOption C and D are too large and don't match the geometry of the scenario.\n\nThis question tests understanding of trigonometry, similar triangles, and spatial reasoning in a complex scenario."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/24", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1338106", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/129118/"], "docs_id": 1338106, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $k\\=b\\_nb\\_{n\\-1}\\\\ldots b\\_3b\\_2b\\_1b\\_0$ be the binary representation of an odd positive integer. \n\nProve:\n\nIf $k\\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4$ then $b\\_1\\=0$.\n\nIf $k\\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 4$ then $b\\_1\\=1$.\n\nI think that to prove the above I need to use $k\\=1 \\+4q$ or $k\\=3 \\+4q$ for $q\\\\geq 0$.

Because this is requireJS dependency mechanism. You can't remove it when it is already required somewhere in the code. The only way that you can determine which file should be called instead call all of it. This means reducing less js file requests to the server."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento 2 project, you want to optimize JavaScript loading and reduce server requests.

The documentation suggests that you can't simply remove RequireJS dependencies when they are already required in the code. Instead, the recommended approach is to determine which specific files should be called, rather than loading all of them. This involves analyzing the codebase to identify necessary JavaScript files and optimizing the RequireJS configuration to load only what's needed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manually removing RequireJS dependencies could break functionality and is not recommended.\n\nOption B is not advisable as it goes against Magento 2's architecture and could lead to compatibility issues.\n\nOption D would be a step backward in terms of performance and maintainability, as it doesn't leverage the benefits of module loading that RequireJS provides.\n\nThe correct approach (C) aligns with modern best practices for front-end performance optimization in Magento 2, reducing the number of JavaScript file requests to the server while maintaining the integrity of the RequireJS dependency system."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/30", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/502750", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/222945/"], "docs_id": 502750, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to configure system clock in the TIVA TM4C123g board.

This current will vary a bit with a changing power rail (Vsupply) but I have assumed 5 mA.\n\nZD2 (a 5\\.6 volt zener) ensures that there will be about 5 volts across the emitter resistor R1 (1 kohm). This means that with a fairly decent accuracy, the current into ZD1 (the collector current) will be about 5 mA. Given that ZD1 is a 5\\.6 volt zener and that a 10 k resistor is then placed across it, the current into the 10 k resistor will be 0\\.56 mA. So, now the ZD1 current will be 5 mA \\- 0\\.56 mA \\= 4\\.44 mA."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the circuit described, what is the approximate current flowing through the zener diode ZD1?\n\nA) 5.0 mA\nB) 4.44 mA\nC) 0.56 mA\nD) 5.6 mA\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe circuit is designed to deliver about 5 mA of current. ZD2 (5.6V zener) and R1 (1k ohm) create a 5V drop, resulting in approximately 5 mA current. This current flows into ZD1 (another 5.6V zener), but a 10k resistor is placed across ZD1. The current through this 10k resistor is 5.6V / 10k = 0.56 mA. Therefore, the current through ZD1 is the difference between the total current and the current through the 10k resistor: 5 mA - 0.56 mA = 4.44 mA.\n\nA) is incorrect as it's the total current before the 10k resistor.\nC) is incorrect as it's only the current through the 10k resistor.\nD) is incorrect as it's the voltage of the zener diodes, not a current."}}
