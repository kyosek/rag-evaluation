We want to predict the value of $z$ at some (unobserved) point $(x,y)$.\n\n**kNN regression:**\n\nFind the $k$ nearest observations to $(x,y)$ and average the corresponding $z$ values. Specifically, if the $k$ closes points to $(x,y)$ are $(x\\_1, y\\_1\\),...,(x\\_k, y\\_k)$ then we predict $z \\= \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{k} z\\_{k}$.\n\n**MLR:**\n\nWe predict $z$ by building a best fit surface (using least squares) and use the equation of the surface to predict $z$. E.g. we may want to model the surface with a degree 2 polynomial (in two variables), i.e. \n$$z \\= \\\\beta\\_1 \\+ \\\\beta\\_2 x \\+ \\\\beta\\_3 y \\+ \\\\beta\\_4 x^2 \\+ \\\\beta\\_5 xy \\+ \\\\beta\\_6 y^2\\.$$\nIn that case, we build matrices $X$ where the $i$th row of $X$ is $X\\_i \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\& x\\_i \\& y\\_i \\& x\\_i^2 \\& x\\_i y\\_i \\& y\\_i^2\\\\end{bmatrix}$ and $Z$ (a column matrix of the $z\\_i$ values), both matrices have $n$ rows. Then, we determine the coefficients $\\\\beta\\_i$ by solving the normal equations $\\\\beta \\= (X^{T}X)^{\\-1}X^{T}Z$.\n\n**Hybrid Method:**\n\nOne can view kNN method as building a degree 0 polynomial (constant) using only the $k$ nearest data points. The technique that I've used is to build a MLR model from the $k$ nearest neighbors (without the constraint that the polynomial be degree 0\\). We also don't require that the same model be used for every region\\-\\-a region being a set of points with the same $k$ nearest neighbors. We use $k$\\-fold cross validation to determine which polynomial degree is optimal\\-\\-when $k$ is small, of course the degree of the polynomial is small. This method feels like a natural relaxation/generalization of traditional kNN.\n\n**Question:** Does this hybrid approach have a name? Is it used frequently? If so, I would love any references that you can provide. I'm in the process of writing a paper that uses this modeling technique and I'd like to call it by the \"correct\" name (and cite original authors) or be able to honestly claim that it is novel.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe surface that is constructed with this method is akin to splines\\-\\-it is a piecewise polynomial model.

The hybrid method described in the documentation applies multiple linear regression (MLR) to the k nearest neighbors of each prediction point. This approach combines the local focus of kNN with the flexibility of MLR.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the method doesn't simply average separate kNN and MLR predictions. \n\nOption C is incorrect as the approach doesn't use kNN for variable selection in a global MLR model.

It's a single-step process that applies MLR to the nearest neighbors.\n\nThe hybrid method can be seen as a generalization of traditional kNN, allowing for more complex local models than just averaging.

The documentation emphasizes that FP ghosts are unphysical mathematical constructs used to deal with gauge symmetries, particularly the diffeomorphism symmetry in quantum gravity. The question of whether black holes evaporate ghosts is not well-defined because FP ghosts themselves are not physical entities. \n\nThe behavior of ghosts in calculations, including those involving black holes, is a matter of gauge choice and can be adjusted using the BRST formalism.

We can quickly compute the number of meaningful tests: you have $12$ measures; each was measured $3$ times in $3$ groups. So if we count all pairwise tests, it will be $3$ tests per group and $3$ tests per measurement time, i.e. $18$ tests per measure, i.e. $216$ tests. You are obviously aware of the lurking multiple comparisons problem (remember the [green beans](https://xkcd.com/882/) comic?), but if you are normally happy to use $\\\\alpha\\=0\\.05$ and were to use e.g. Bonferroni adjustment then you would have to use $\\\\alpha \\= 0\\.05/216\\\\approx 0\\.002$ and to risk not finding any significant effects because you do not have enough power.\n\nThis is of course not a unique, but in fact a very common situation.\n\nBroadly speaking, you can adopt one of the two approaches. \n\n**Confirmatory approach** insists on strict adherence to the rules of significance testing. You should formulate your one or several (but as few as possible) research hypotheses in advance and carefully plan which statistical tests you are going to carry out. To mitigate the multiple comparisons / low power problem, you should try to design your tests such that you use as few tests as possible while having maximal power to detect what you really want to detect. For example, you might want to combine your measures into some composite or pooled measures that are likely to be most affected by Treatment 1 or 2\\. Or you can pool over measurement times. Etc. In any case, you try to boil down all your data to a couple of *crucial* comparisons, and then you do only those, applying Bonferroni (or similar) adjustment. It's important that all of that is planned before you have ever looked at the data (because after looking at the data you will be tempted to change your tests).\n\nAlas, in practice, this is often hardly possible.\n\n**Exploratory approach,** in contrast, is like biting the bullet: you have a lot of rich data, so why not explore all sorts of relationships that are present in there. You will do lots of comparisons and lots of tests, you will adjust your analysis strategy depending on what you see in the data, but whatever \\-\\- this is all exploratory. You cannot do that if you are doing a clinical trial, but in more basic research this if often the only way to go. All $p$\\-values that you get out of this approach should be taken with a (big) grain of salt, though. In fact, some would say that you should not run or report any significance tests at all, but usually tests are still done. There is a good argument not to use multiple comparisons adjustments (such as Bonferroni) at all, and rather treat all the $p$\\-values as indicating strength of evidence in the Fisherian sence (as opposed to leading to a yes/no decision in the Neyman\\-Pearson sence).\n\n### Statistical tests if you are willing to assume normality\n\nLet's for the moment ignore the issue of normality (see below) and assume that everything is normal. You have the following battery of tests:\n\n1. For each measure, within\\-group pairwise comparison between two measurement times is a *paired t\\-test*. It will test if the measurements differ between these two times.\n2. For each measure, between\\-group pairwise comparison for one measurement time is an *unpaired t\\-test*. It will test if these two groups differ on this specific measurement.\n3. For each measure, within\\-group comparison between all three different measurement times is a *repeated measures ANOVA*. It will test if measurement time has any effect at all.\n4. For each measure, between\\-group comparison between for one fixed measurement time, is a *one\\-way ANOVA*. It will test if groups differ in any way between each other.\n5. For each measure, comparison between all groups and all times is a *two\\-way repeated measures ANOVA*. It will test if there is a significant effect of group, significant effect of time, and significant interaction between them.\n6. For all measures, comparison between all groups and all times is a *two\\-way repeated measures MANOVA*. It will test if there is a significant effect of group, significant effect of time, or significant interaction between them on all measures taken together.\n\nNote that \\#1 and \\#2 can be seen as a post\\-hocs to \\#3 and \\#4 respectively, \\#3 and \\#4 can be seen as post\\-hocs to \\#5, and \\#5 can be seen as post\\-hoc to \\#6\\.\n\n\\[With an additional complication then when these tests are done as post\\-hocs they use some of the pooled estimates of the \"parent\" test in order to be more consistent with it; I am not sure though if these procedures exist on the higher levels of the hierarchy.]\n\nSo you have a layered structure and you can proceed in the top\\-down manner from the most general (\\#6\\) level down to most specific (\\#1 and \\#2\\) tests and run each next level only if you have significant *omnibus* effect on the higher level (apologies for the potential confusion; \"higher\" levels have higher numbers in my list and hence are located on the bottom of it... \"top\\-down\" means starting with MANOVA in \\#6 and going until t\\-tests in \\#1 and \\#2\\). This should protect you from false positives on the lower level, and so you arguably (!) don't need to do multiple comparison adjustments on the lower level (but as far as I understand, opinions on that differ).\n\nYou can also start directly at some middle layer and e.g. run 12 times \\#5 without doing \\#6, or 36 times \\#3 and 36 times \\#4 without doing \\#5\\. In confirmatory framework, you must then apply some multiple comparison correction (such as Bonferroni or rather Holm\\-Bonferroni). In exploratory framework this is not necessary, see above (example: maybe without adjustment you get $p\\=0\\.01$ effect in many different measures and it is very consistent; you are probably looking at a real effect then, but if you make Bonferroni adjustment then everything will stop being significant \\-\\- too bad. Instead, in exploratory framework you should rather keep $p\\=0\\.01$ as is and use your own expert judgment, but of course at your own risk).\n\nBy the way, if your Treatments work at all, you should expect significant effect of interaction in \\#6 and \\#5, so these are (hopefully!) almost guaranteed, and the interesting stuff begins at layers \\#3 and \\#4\\. If there is a real danger that both Treatments are as bad as placebo then perhaps you should really start with \\#6\\.\n\n**Another remark:** a more \"modern\" approach would be to use a linear mixed model (with subjects being a random effect) instead of repeated measures ANOVA, but that's a whole other topic that I am not very familiar with. It would be great if somebody posted an answer here written from a mixed models perspective.\n\n### Statistical tests if you are not willing to assume normality\n\nThere are ranked analogues of most of these tests, but not of all of them. The analogues are as follows:\n\n1. Wilcoxon test\n2. Mann\\-Whitney\\-Wilcoxon test\n3. Friedman test\n4. Kruskal\\-Wallis test\n5. ?? (probably does not exist)\n6. ???? (most probably does not exist, but see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/133444))\n\nAdditional complication is that post\\-hocs become tricky. Proper post\\-hoc to Kruskal\\-Wallis is not Mann\\-Whitney\\-Wilcoxon but the Dunn's test \\[it takes into account the issue that I mentioned in the square brackets above]. Similarly, proper post\\-hoc to Friedman is not Wilcoxon; not sure if it exists but if it does it is even more obscure than Dunn's.\n\n### Normality testing\n\nIt is in general a very bad idea to test for normality in order to decide whether you should use parametric or nonparametric tests. It will affect your $p$\\-values in an unpredictable way. At least in the confirmatory paradigm, you should decide on the test *prior to looking at the data*; if you have doubts about normality approximation, then rather don't use it. See here for more discussion: [Choosing a statistical test based on the outcome of another (e.g. normality)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/61715).\n\nIn your case, this means that you should use only parametric tests or only nonparametric tests for all measures (unless you have *a priori* grounds to suspect substantial deviations from normality in only a specific subset of measures; this does not seem to be the case).\n\nIn simple cases people often suggest to use ranked tests because they are powerful, simple, and you don't need to worry about the assumptions. But in your case, nonparametric tests will be a mess so you have a good argument in favour of classical ANOVAs. By the way, the histograms that you posted look \"normal enough\" to me that with your sample size you should not worry too much about them not being normal.\n\n### Data presentation\n\nI would strongly advice to rely on visualization as opposed to only listing hundreds of $p$\\-values in a text or a table. With the data like that, first thing I would do (note: this is very exploratory!), would be to make a giant figure with 12 subplots, where each subplot corresponds to one measure and shows time on the x\\-axis (three measurements) and groups as lines of different color (with error bars).\n\nThen just stare at this figure for really long and try to see if it makes sense. Hopefully the effects will be consistent across measures, across time points, etc. I would make this figure the main figure of the paper.\n\nIf you like, you can then pepper this figure with the results of your statistical tests (mark significant differences with stars).\n\n---\n\n### Brief answers to your specific questions\n\n1. Yes (almost \\-\\- see the caveat about Wilcoxon as post\\-hoc)\n2. Yes\n3. Yes\n4. Use figures as much as you can.\n\n### Word of caution\n\n> We would like to know if Treatment 2 (Dietary Supplement 2\\) has the same effect (or even better) on body composition than Treatment 1, while not having those adverse effects on blood profiles.\n\nTo show that Treatment 2 does not have as much adverse effects as Treatment 1, it's not enough to show that there is significant difference between T1 and Controls but no significant difference between T2 and Controls. This is a common mistake. You actually need to show significant difference between T2 and T1\\.\n\n---\n\n**Further reading:**\n\n* [Multiple Comparisons with Repeated Measures](http://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/RepMeasMultComp/RepMeasMultComp.html) \\-\\- tutorial focused on SPSS but with a really good discussion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a study on the effects of two dietary supplements on body composition and blood profiles.

At the 5 kW level, you could expect to find the efficiency differences to be fairly small."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An industrial process currently uses a 5 kW 3-phase AC Induction Motor (ACIM) with a gearbox to drive a constant load at a constant speed. The plant engineer wants to replace this setup with a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor system. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this replacement?\n\nA) A 3 kW BLDC motor will definitely be sufficient due to its higher efficiency compared to ACIM.\nB) The BLDC motor should also be rated at 5 kW to ensure it can handle the same mechanical load.\nC) The BLDC motor must be rated higher than 5 kW to compensate for efficiency losses in the new system.\nD) The power rating of the replacement BLDC motor can only be determined after measuring the actual load requirements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Motors are generally rated by their output mechanical power, regardless of their type or efficiency. Since the original ACIM was rated at 5 kW, the replacement BLDC motor should also be rated at 5 kW to ensure it can handle the same mechanical load. While BLDC motors may be more efficient, this doesn't necessarily mean a lower-rated motor can handle the same load. The 5 kW rating ensures the new motor can meet the maximum power requirement of the application. If the load actually requires less power, this could be determined through measurement, but without that information, it's safest to match the original motor's power rating."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/13", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/515633", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/177731/"], "docs_id": 515633, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Seeking help with a new SQL server.\n\nA client of mine was running an aging SBS 2003 server (Xeon 3060, 4 gig of RAM) and a line of business application with a 25 gig SQL Database using SQL Server 2005\\. They have 14 simultaneous users. The server had 1 gigabit NIC and everything is interfaced to a single 48 port gigabit switch.\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS:**\n\nI replaced the server with a new one (Xeon E5620, 48 gig of RAM) running Hyper\\-V Server Core 2012\\. The new server has 4 NIC's as follows:\n\n* 2 Intel Gigabit NIC's configured as a LBFO team. The team is interfaced to a virtual switch, to which all of the VM's interface via Virtual NIC's.\n* 1 Gigabit NIC for Hyper\\-V Administration\n* 1 Dedicated NIC onboard for IPMI\n\nThe virtual machines and allocated memory are as follows:\n\n* 'SBS2011' (16 gig) Is their DC, Exchange Server, DNS, etc. and also their general file share\n* 'SERVER2' (16 gig) Is running the SBS Premium Add\\-On (Server 2008 R2 \\+ SQL Server 2008 Standard) and is hosting their line of business database and another file share related to that database.\n* A virtual Win7pro (4 gig) machine I use occasionally as a test workstation\n* A virtual Win8pro (4 gig) machine I use for the Hyper\\-V administration (although I am finding I prefer the powershell commands better).\n* This leaves 8 gig remaining for the Hyper\\-V core's overhead\n\n**SYMPTOMS:** \n\nWhen the first users come in and start working it functions acceptably but after only a 5\\-10 minutes the performance tanks. It then takes anywhere from 10\\-30 seconds for them to switch 'tabs' within their application. This happens with wired as well as wireless clients.\n\nThe SQL server is allocated 16 gig of RAM, of course the SQL service immediately took 15 gig. Since this server also serves two other small applications and a file share I figured it prudent to cap the SQL memory at 10 gig. The issue persists.\n\nFiguring I needed to approach this in a logical manner I have installed software to monitor aspects of the network including memory \\& CPU usage on both servers, bandwidth for both servers and for the wireless. Now that it has gathered some data for me to work with I believe I am still having memory related issues on the SQL server.\n\nBear in mind the old server ran the same database along with SBS operating system, Exchange, all File Shares, and SQL 2005 on a total of 4 gig of RAM, so I figured 16 gig should be ok. Of course I realize this is a different OS and different software.\n\n**Things I have done so far:**\n\n1. Capped the SQL instance at 10 gig to leave resources for other applications and overhead\n2. Configured the backup to shutdown the SQL service at 12:30am and to restart it at 1:00am (The idea was to release resources)\n\nThe client employees begin arriving to work at about 7:30am, performance tanks by 8:00am. You can see in the server memory graph below that the following is occurring:\n\n![memory usage](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LfLlv.jpg)\n\nThe available memory is about 4 gig from the previous day\n12:30am the SQL service stops and available memory becomes about 15 gig.\n1:00am the SQL service starts and available memory becomes about 5\\.5 gig\n7:30am employee's arrivce\n7:50am available memory starts to dive (Employee's starting to log into applications)\n8:10am performance is poor, employee's unhappy, boss unhappy \\= me unhappy\n\n**My thoughts and considerations:**\n\nThis is a medical office that is seeing patients all day. More than half of the staff are accessing patient records for brief periods while the patient is there. Long term caching of this information is probably unnecessary. The rest of the staff is accessing schedules, billing, etc. All from the same application.\n\n1. Available server memory seems to be related. Agree/Disagree?\n2. I have read about Windows file system cache, I would like advice on this.\n3. I feel I should allocate more memory to the SQL Server virtual machine. I can nuke the Win8 \\& Win7 VM's down to 1 gig and leave 4 for the Hyper\\-V core. That would give me 10 gig to toss at the SQL server, bumping it to 26 gig.\n4. Pertaining to \\#3, I would like advice on how to to allocate this memory within the server. Should I give it to the 2008 R2 OS, give it to the SQL Instance, or spread it out among the two?\n5. What other things should I consider doing to improve performance.\n6. CPU usage and Bandwidth don't seem to be a problem from what I can see but please see resource screenshots and graphics at doaks.net/sqlhelp\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cluster?

Upgrade the network infrastructure to 10 Gigabit Ethernet to handle the increased data transfer.\n\nC) The CPU is overloaded. Upgrade the physical server's CPU to a more powerful model with more cores.\n\nD) The Windows file system cache is not optimized. Adjust the filesystem cache settings to improve performance for the SQL server workload.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the performance issues is insufficient memory allocation for the SQL server. The symptoms describe performance degradation shortly after users begin work, and the memory usage graph shows available memory dropping significantly at this time. \n\nThe current allocation of 16 GB for the SQL server VM, with SQL capped at 10 GB, is insufficient for the workload. Increasing the VM's memory to 26 GB and allowing SQL to use more of that memory (e.g., 20 GB) would likely resolve the issue.

The one in my garage started going crazy so I removed it and bought a regualr dual switch to replace it. The problem is, once I went to connect the new switch I realized it was not as simple as I thought. There are three sets of wires. Long story short... I've tried every connection possible that makes sense, but clearly I'm missing something. Attaching the photos here. The middle set of wires in the connection box (see second photo) are the ones that seem to have the power, since certain combinations with those specifically cause a trip to the breaker. Anyone have any idea how these should be connected? ![photo 1 - this is the broken smart switch I replaced](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vT32V.jpg)![photo 2 - this is the connection box](https://i.stack.imgur.com/atgc4.jpg)![photo 3 - this is my new dual switch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AEG5v.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The old smart switch is not capable of controlling a fan and light separately... and you never claimed it did. That means your 3 cables are \n\n* Supply (always\\-hot)\n* Onward (always\\-hot) power to something else\n* (Switched\\-hot) power to the fan/light\n\nFirst, all grounds get nutted together with a **pigtail** that you'll need to buy, and get pushed into the back of the box (except the pigtail, bring that out!) \n\nSecond, all white wires get nutted together and pushed into the back of the box. These are **neutral**. You don't need a pigtail here; ***dumb switches don't use neutral***. \n\nThird, that switch goes into the trash. Get a plain single switch. \n\nFourth, The ground pigtail goes to this switch's ground terminal. \n\nFifth, get a black pigtail and attach it to one of the screws on the switch. This gets wire\\-nutted together with the black wire you are fairly sure is supply hot. Feel free to wire\\-nut this very lightly, you'll be adding to it later. These two wires are called **always\\-hot**.\n\nSixth, pick an unattached black wire. Attach it to the remaining screw on the switch. We are guessing here. \n\nSeventh, power up the circuit and see if the fan/light is starting to work. If both work, awesome, you have identified *switched\\-hot* for both light and fan... go to step 8\\. If neither one works, repeat step 6\\-7 with the other unattached wire. *If only one of them works, power down and repeat step 6\\-7 with the other unattached black wire.*\n\n> If one wire works the fan and the other works the light, then you've made a monkey out of me. Fish that double switch out of the trash and follow somebody else's instructions.\n\nIf both of them work with one wire attached, then my advice stands. Leave that wire attached and step 7 is done. \n\nEighth, take the remaining black wire and attach it to the black wires under the wire\\-nut. This time, crank it down gorilla\\-tight. \n\nFor bonus points, identify the light\\+fan wire and mark it with red tape. Or if they are separately controlled, mark the fan with red tape and the light with blue tape. You'll thank me later. If you had color coded these wires at the very start of this, life would've been much easier.

It correctly identifies the need to connect all ground wires with a pigtail to the switch's ground terminal, connects all white (neutral) wires together, and properly handles the black wires. One black wire (supply hot) is connected to a switch terminal and to another black wire (onward power), while the remaining black wire (switched hot) goes to the other switch terminal.

I want something that is continuous, additive and has finite support. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **A minimal example** is obtained by taking literally *any* distribution with compact support on the nonnegative reals. Letting $F$ be its cumulative distribution function, this means there exist $0\\\\le a\\\\le b$ for which $F(a)\\=0$ and $F(b)\\=1\\.$ Repeated convolution produces the sequence of distribution functions $F\\_n,$ $n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots,$ for which $F\\_1 \\= F$ and for all $n\\\\ge 1,$\n\n$$F\\_{n\\+1}(x) \\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} F\\_n(x\\-y)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} F(y).$$\n\nBecause this corresponds to addition of random variables, the support of $F\\_n$ is contained in the interval $\\[na,nb],$ which is compact and non\\-negative.\n\nWhen $X\\_n$ is a random variable with distribution $F\\_n$ and $X\\_m$ a random variable with distribution $F\\_m,$ this ensures that $X\\_n\\+X\\_m$ has distribution $F\\_{n\\+m},$ showing this family $(F\\_n)$ is closed under addition. Its parameter is $n.$ When $F$ is a continuous distribution, so is $F\\_n.$ Thus, **$(F\\_n)$ satisfies all the requirements of the question.**\n\nAt <https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/43075/919> I describe such a family explicitly (and in great detail) where $F$ is the Uniform$(0,1\\)$ distribution. This shows that **the construction of $(F\\_n)$ is not just an abstraction:** it can lead to distributions with computable formulas and concrete applications.\n\n---\n\nIt might be objected that $n$ can attain only integral values. We can try to fix that. If there were such a family associated with all positive real $n$ it would be *infinitely divisible:* for all $n,$ the distribution $F\\_n$ could be expressed as the convolution of $F\\_{n/2}$ with itself, or generally the $k$\\-fold convolution of $F\\_{n/k}$ for any whole number $k.$ The [Wikipedia article on infinite divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_divisibility_(probability)) asserts that apart from atomic distributions (which concentrate all probability on a single value), **there exist no infinitely divisible family of distributions with \"bounded (finite) support.\"** It does not prove this, but refers to Sato, Ken\\-iti (1999\\), *L\u00e9vy Processes and Infinitely Divisible Distributions* for the details.\n\n**The minimal example can, however, be enlarged by adding in other distributions.** For instance, by adding in any atomic distribution supported on a non\\-negative value $\\\\mu$ we can introduce a *location parameter.* In effect, writing\n\n$$F\\_{n;\\\\mu}(x) \\= F\\_n(x\\-\\\\mu)$$\n\nwe create a two\\-parameter family where the parameter $n$ must be a whole number and $\\\\mu$ can be any non\\-negative real number. These distributions are supported on the intervals $\\[na\\+\\\\mu,nb\\+\\\\mu]$ which are non\\-negative and compact. For corresponding random variables $X\\_{n;\\\\nu}$ and $X\\_{m;\\\\mu},$ clearly $$X\\_{n;\\\\nu}\\+X\\_{m;\\\\mu}$$ has $F\\_{m\\+n;\\\\mu\\+\\\\nu}$ for its distribution. Thus, the family $$(F\\_{n;\\\\mu}),\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, \\\\mu \\\\ge 0$$ satisfies the condition of the question.\n\n**We can generate larger families very generally by emulating this process of combining two families of distributions under addition.** When $(G\\_n)$ is also an additively closed family of distributions with non\\-negative compact support, then for any pairs of whole numbers $m$ and $n$ let $H\\_{m,n}$ be the distribution of $X\\_m\\+Y\\_n$ where $X\\_m\\\\sim F\\_m$ and $Y\\_n\\\\sim G\\_n.$ The family $(H\\_{m,n},\\\\, m\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots)$ satisfies all the conditions of the question. This process can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n**In a specific sense, *all* solutions to this problem arise in this way.** When $\\\\mathcal F$ is any set of distributions with compact non\\-negative support, define the \"additive closure\" of $\\\\mathcal F$ to be the intersection of all sets of distributions that are additively closed and include $\\\\mathcal F.$ This intersection exists because the set of *all* distributions is one such set. All additively closed families obviously equal their own additive closures.

I believe it doesn't. In primary school, we all learned how to induce a magnetic field into an iron nail by wrapping coils of wire around the nail and then hooking it up to a DC battery, but if you do not coil the wire, the magnetic nail doesn't occur. What's happening here? My only guess are the electrons are accelerating; the magnitudes of their speeds aren't changing, but rather their directions. In the coil, a force must be applying itself to the electrons in order for them to make their spiralling paths, thus, they are said to be accelerating and that is what causes the magnetic field to develop.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A straight wire does have a magnetic field.

The right picture shows a multi\\-loop wire (a solenoid), which enhances the field compared to the single loop. The right picture is the kind of field you created with the wire and nail. For the same current, the solenoid creates a much stronger field, which is why it is used to magnetize the nail.\n\nTo answer your original question, a single electron in motion does have a magnetic field that's similar to the straight wire (the field curls around the electron's path of motion) except that it gets weaker as you move farther away along the electon's path."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electron is moving with constant velocity v along the positive x-axis.

The field circles around the particle's path of motion, similar to the magnetic field around a straight wire carrying current. In this case, with the electron moving along the positive x-axis and the point P located above it on the y-axis, the magnetic field at P will point in the negative z-direction (you can use the right-hand rule to determine this). The magnitude of the magnetic field decreases as the distance from the electron's path increases, so it will decrease as y increases.

Basically the transconductor gives you a gm (kind of a 1/R) and you dump the resulting current into a cap. This gives you the C for your 1/RC cutoff. Check out the datasheet for this part here: [TI LM13700 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm13700.pdf)\n\nFigure 3 in the datasheet will give you a starting point for a very simple VCF.

But why is log convexity important? How does it affect the Gamma function's applicability in other areas of mathematics?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, let me mention that log convexity of a function is implied by an analytic property, which appears to be more natural than log convexity itself. Namely, if $\\\\mu$ is a Borel measure on $\\[0,\\\\infty)$ such that the $r$th moment \n$$f(r)\\=\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}z^r d\\\\mu(z)$$\nis finite for all $r$ in the interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$, then $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$.\n\nLog convexity can be effectively used in derivation of various inequalities involving the gamma function (particularly, two\\-sided estimates of products of gamma functions). It is linked with the notion of [Schur convexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorization) which is itself used in many applications.\n\n**An appetizer.** Let $m\\=\\\\max x\\_i$, $s\\=\\\\sum x\\_i$, $x\\_i \\> 0$, $i \\= 1,\\\\dots,n$, then\n$$\\[\\\\Gamma(s/n)]^n\\\\leq\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{1}^{n}\\\\Gamma (x\\_i)\\\\leq \\\\left\\[\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{s\\-m}{n\\-1}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{n\\-1}\\\\Gamma(m).\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1\\)$$\n\n(1\\) is trivial, of course, when all $x\\_i$ and $s/n$ are integers, but in general the bounds do not hold without assuming log convexity.\n\n**Edit added: a sketch of the proof**. Let $f$ be a continuous positive function defined on an interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$. One may show that the function $\\\\phi(x)\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^{n}f(x\\_i)$, $x\\\\in I^n$ is Schur\\-convex on $I^n$ if and only if $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$. Thus the function \n$$\\\\phi(x)\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^n \\\\Gamma(x\\_i),\\\\quad x\\_i\\>0,\\\\qquad \\\\quad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\quad (2\\)$$ \nis Schur\\-convex on $I^n\\=(0,\\\\infty)^n$. Since $x\\_i\\\\le m$, $i\\=1,\\\\dots,n$, and $\\\\sum x\\_i\\=s$, it is easy to check that \n$$x \\\\prec \\\\left(\\\\frac{s\\-m}{n\\-1},\\\\dots,\\\\frac{s\\-m}{n\\-1},m\\\\right).$$\nThe latter [majorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorization) and the fact that $\\\\phi(x)$ defined by (2\\) is Schur\\-convex imply the upper bound (1\\). The lower bound follows from the standard majorization $x\\\\succ (s/n,\\\\dots,s/n)$.\n\n---\n\nHave a look at [the recent short article](http://www.springerlink.com/content/k4285g1811744605/) by Marshall and Olkin concerning this and related inequalities for the gamma function."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the inequality for the Gamma function:\n\n[\u0393(s/n)]^n \u2264 \u220f(i=1 to n) \u0393(x_i) \u2264 [\u0393((s-m)/(n-1))]^(n-1) \u0393(m)\n\nWhere m = max x_i, s = \u03a3x_i, x_i > 0, i = 1,...,n\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding this inequality and its relation to the log-convexity of the Gamma function?\n\nA) The inequality holds for all real positive values of x_i without assuming log-convexity of the Gamma function.\n\nB) Log-convexity of the Gamma function is necessary for the upper bound of the inequality, but not for the lower bound.\n\nC) The inequality is a direct consequence of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem's first two conditions, and log-convexity is not required.\n\nD) Log-convexity of the Gamma function is crucial for this inequality to hold for non-integer values of x_i, and it allows the use of Schur-convexity in the proof.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The log-convexity of the Gamma function, which is the third condition in the Bohr-Mollerup theorem, is essential for this inequality to hold for non-integer values of x_i. While the inequality is trivial for integer values, it doesn't necessarily hold for real values without the log-convexity property. \n\nLog-convexity allows the product of Gamma functions to be treated as a Schur-convex function, which is key to proving the inequality using majorization principles. This approach is necessary because simple integer-based reasoning doesn't apply to real-valued arguments.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they either underestimate the importance of log-convexity or mistakenly attribute the inequality to other properties of the Gamma function. The inequality's validity for all real positive x_i is fundamentally tied to the log-convexity property."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/28", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/364613", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/30996/"], "docs_id": 364613, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been trying to get LDAP authentication and NFS exported home directories on CentOS 6 working for a few days now.

In a way, the issue is resolved since if I use any other ports than the line out, the sound is working like it should.

The name or IP address of the server, referred to as DNSName\n2. The share path\n\n**How do you find this stuff out?**\n\nThis assumes you **don't** know what the share paths are. If you already know, skip down to \"Connecting\"\n\nUsing my own personal Synology Diskstation as an example, I have shared two directories via NFS. It's DNS name is diskstation.home. Its IP address is 192\\.168\\.1\\.50 (not really, but it is for the sake of this example)\n\nLaunch the Terminal App.\n\nAt the prompt, type the following command:\n\n```\nshowmount -e diskstation.home\n(replace diskstation.home with your DNSname or IP Address)\n\n```\n\nIn my example, the following is displayed:\n\n```\n$ showmount -e diskstation.home\nExports list on diskstation.home:\n/volume1/netbackup                  *\n/volume1/Network Share              *\n\n```\n\nOk...so now I know what the two \"share paths\" are. It's time to connect.\n\n**Connecting**\n\nLet's use finder:\n\nPress `Command``K` to bring up the \"Connect to Server\" Dialog Box.  \n\nIn the \"Server Address\" box, type enter the values in the format:\n\n```\nnfs://DNSName/path\nor\nnfs://IP/path\n\n```\n\nSo, going back to my example, I would type:\n\n```\nnfs://diskstation.home/volume1/netbackup\nor\nnfs://192.168.1.50/volume1/netbackup\n\n```\n\nYou should now be able to browse your network share."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're trying to mount an NFS share from a Seagate Business Storage NAS with IP address 192.168.1.100.

Which means Razor procs will hit enemies full Magic Resistance, making the item even worse.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\n* Stack AD. Riven has great AD scaling, and you can always use more of it. Remember that it also makes your shield stronger!\n* Stack Lifesteal. Since Riven's passive\\-boost on autoattacks counts for lifesteal, this can make enormous difference, especially in 1v1\\. Also, lifesteal scales with the AD you're already stacking. Stacking Bloodthirsters can be legitimate tactic on Riven. If you want advantage earlier in the game, stacking Doran's Blades is also very good.\n* Don't forget some Armor Penetration/Reduction. Brutalizer gives good flat bonus for early game, plus some AD and some CDR. For late game, Last Whisper gives percentage\\-based bonus, and yes \\- more AD!\n* If you are in a teamfight: don't focus the HP stacking opponents \\- go for the squishies instead. Other people in your team should be better prepared for clearing out the tough guys later (maybe even by having the Bloodrazor, if they can use it better and if the situation warrants it)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As Riven facing a team with high HP champions, which item build strategy would be most effective?\n\nA) Build Madred's Bloodrazor for its 4% max health damage\nB) Stack multiple Bloodthirsters for high AD and lifesteal\nC) Build a mix of attack speed items to proc on-hit effects more often\nD) Focus on magic penetration items to counter magic resistance\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. Stacking Bloodthirsters is mentioned as a legitimate tactic for Riven. This strategy aligns with Riven's strengths and playstyle for several reasons:\n\n1. Riven scales exceptionally well with AD, and Bloodthirsters provide high AD.\n2. The lifesteal from Bloodthirsters synergizes well with Riven's passive, which boosts her auto-attacks.\n3. Lifesteal scales with AD, creating a powerful combination.\n\nOption A (Madred's Bloodrazor) is incorrect because:\n- Riven doesn't benefit much from attack speed.\n- She has no magic damage, so the magic damage from Bloodrazor would be less effective.\n\nOption C (attack speed items) is wrong because Riven's optimal playstyle involves attacking after ability use, not rapid auto-attacking.\n\nOption D (magic penetration) is incorrect as Riven deals physical damage, not magical damage.\n\nThe question tests understanding of champion-specific item building, scaling, and countering high HP opponents."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/12", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/205230", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/92964/"], "docs_id": 205230, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does \"as\" mean in article below?\n\n> President Trump is the president of the USA.

What if for future projects I do what I suggested, start working on a newer than LTS version (only if I've researched the timeline of LTS release and am sure the migration will be within budget)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The advantage of LTS projects is not the newness, but the length of time to get patches. Not all updates are created equal, and having access to patch\\-only releases can save time and reduce overall risk of upgrades.\n\nDifferent products have different meanings for standard and long\\-term support. For example, Django is 16 months for standard (feature releases happen approximately every 8 months, and the last 2 feature releases are supported) and 3 years for LTS. Debian is 3 years and 5 years. For talking in concrete terms, let's use Debian.\n\nIf you were to use the standard Debian release, you would only get support for 3 years. After that, there's no guarantees about things like availability of package repositories or new patch releases. If there were to be a critical vulnerability in year 4, you may be forced to update to a new minor or even major version of Debian. Because it is more than a patch, you will probably need to do a lot more due diligence to ensure that your system continues to function as expected on the new version. There's also a greater chance that you will need to make additional changes to support the new version, and those changes will also drive additional design and testing effort. However, when something is called a patch, the general assumption is that the functionality remains the same minus the repairs to the defects.\n\nA lot of the level of risk does depend on your system. For example, a life critical system may not be able to accept patches without rigorous testing. Even though the intention may be to maintain functionality, the patch may have introduced a regression and those defects would be unacceptable in a system that may cause loss of life. For most systems, though, the amount of change in a component is considered when determining the risks in upgrading that component and the amount of work needed to reduce that risk to an acceptable level.\n\nAt the end of the day, the client will have to make the decision based on their tolerance for risk. However, I would not just assume that there will be a budget for upgrading components. Usually, a new LTS version is released before the support for the previous version expires, which gives you a runway to switch. You can plan for the effort needed to not only upgrade the components, but perform all of the necessary testing and any additional changes to support that upgrade while making sure that your system can receive security patches for any critical vulnerabilities."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is considering whether to use the Long-Term Support (LTS) version or a newer standard version of a framework for their next enterprise project.

As stated in the documentation, \"The advantage of LTS projects is not the newness, but the length of time to get patches.\" LTS versions typically offer a longer support window (e.g., 3-5 years) compared to standard versions, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities can be addressed without forcing major upgrades. This reduces risk and maintenance effort over time, especially for long-running enterprise projects.\n\nOption A is incorrect because LTS versions prioritize stability over new features.

I am writing this because I feel that @Ezikiel Elin answer is, in some parts, misleading.\n\n**Physical cores and hyper\\-threading**\n\nYour CPU has 4 cores, but also has [Hyper\\-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading) which presents 8 virtual cores to the operating system. This has the benefit of allowing the cores to more rapidly change from running one process thread to another thread (quite likely from a different process). There are circumstances where this can slow throughput, but it is usually beneficial.\n\nActivity monitor presents all 8 virtual cores. The first physical core is shown as the first two virtual cores in the graphs. The second physical is in graphs 3 and 4, and so on. In your example, the cores are only lightly loaded and not sufficient to make significant use of hyper\\-threading.\n\n**Swap and Compressed**\n\nThere are time when macOS and your running applications need more memory can than comfortably fit in physical RAM. In that case, the memory management of macOS frees up RAM in two ways:\n\n1. Take some memory and compress it. In your example, 906 MB of physical RAM is being used to store some unspecified (but probably about twice that) of macOS and application memory. Of course, the memory will need to be decompressed before it is next used.\n2. Move some portions of memory out of physical RAM and store them on the boot disk. In your case, 6\\.64 GB of disk space in being used in this way. When an application requires to use that memory, it will have to be brought back into physical RAM. This moving portions of memory out and in to RAM is called swapping and the disk space used is in one or more swap files.\n\nCompressing and decompressing is a relatively fast action using a highly efficient algorithm. Swapping is slower. When boot disks were hard disks, this was a key cause of slow system response. With SSDs, this is quicker and leads to a more responsive feel to the system.\n\nmacOS's memory tuning has a preference for compression rather than swapping, though in your example, it has decided that rather a lot of memory must be taken out of physical RAM and placed in the swap files. Ideally, the memory tuning will have chosen application memory that is unlikely to be wanted for some time.\n\n**Memory calculations**\n\nMemory allocations can be counted in more than one way, but as presented by Activity Monitor:\n\nApp Memory \\+ Wired memory \\+ Compressed \\= Memory Used\n\nWired memory is memory which can't be compressed or swapped. I don't like the use of \"memory used\" in this context because, in reality, nearly all the physical RAM is usefully occupied. But that is what Activity Monitor calls it.\n\nMemory Used \\+ Cached Files \\+ Free memory \\= Physical Memory\n\nSo it is true that Memory Used \\+ Cached Files is always less than or equal to Physical RAM.\n\nWith a simple calculation, you can work out that your Free Memory is only 0\\.10 GB.\n\nYour \"memory pressure\" graph is green, which indicates that macOS is able to manage memory with few bottlenecks.\n\n**Disk IO and Data**\n\nTo the left of the graph, Activity Monitor shows that number of read and write operations (called IO in the graphs) both as totals since boot and current rates.\n\nEach disk operation can read or write variable amounts of data. The values for amount of data and current rates are on the right hand side. The graph calls this DATA (which seems reasonable to me).\n\nFrom your graphs and current counters, the Mac looks fairly busy from the disk point of view. But the graphs have no units which does limit their usefulness."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A MacBook Pro user is analyzing their system performance using Activity Monitor.

The 4 physical cores appear as 8 virtual cores due to hyper-threading, and the compressed memory of 906 MB likely represents about twice that amount of uncompressed data.\nC is incorrect. A green memory pressure graph indicates good memory management, not high usage. Also, cached files are part of used memory.\nD is incorrect.

Option A involves steps that were already tried without success. Option C suggests changing configuration that shouldn't inherently cause 404 errors.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it addresses a known fix for a similar issue in Magento 2.3.1, which could be applied to version 2.3.0 as well.

For e.g., [android](/questions/tagged/android \"show questions tagged 'android'\"), [google\\-chrome](/questions/tagged/google-chrome \"show questions tagged 'google-chrome'\"), [flex](/questions/tagged/flex \"show questions tagged 'flex'\") are all sponsored by their respective companies and carry their logo in the tag homepage and in all the tags.

This allows the company's logo to appear on the tag homepage and wherever the tag is used. The company can then set their homepage to stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/company-name to get a filtered list of questions with their tag.

IMHO, there is no need to ask questions about a tutorial on SO, they should be directed towards the provider of the tutorial, or the community around it.

If it's a good programming question, it is fine to ask on SO, no matter what triggered it. \n\nHowever, those questions need to follow the same rules as any other question on SO. They need to\n\n* have merit on their own. Would the question be a valid programming question if it *didn't* come from a tutorial?\n* be self\\-contained. They must contain all the relevant information without having to read/visit the tutorial.\n* demonstrate a basic understanding of the problem.

The other options (A, B, and D) are all valid criteria mentioned in the documentation for asking questions about tutorials. Specifically, questions need to be self-contained, demonstrate understanding, and have merit on their own to be considered appropriate for Stack Overflow."}}
