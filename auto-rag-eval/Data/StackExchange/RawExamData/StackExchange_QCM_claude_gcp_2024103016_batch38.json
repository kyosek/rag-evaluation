Isn't the job of the developer to write bugs or failing tests? If this is true how a QA fit in? Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Developers are very, very good at abstraction. If you give us half a problem, we'll come up with the whole solution. In fact, we're so good at this, we won't even notice that we've only got half the problem. We're \"solution space\" people. Our job is to solve problems.\n\nTesters, on the other hand, are \"problem space\" people. They're the ones who ask, \"What about X? Or Y? Have you thought about Z?\" They know how to break our code before we've even written it. If we're really nice to them, they'll tell us. Their job is to understand the problem backwards.\n\nAn analyst or SME might be good at working out which problems are the most important to solve, but once they've made that decision, testers are just as good as they are at understanding the nature of the problem chosen. Devs tend not to be good at this because of our \"solution space\" heads; we blind ourselves to the things we don't know.\n\nIn an environment where you're doing BDD or TDD, testers are invaluable for helping you, and the business, spot the tests or scenarios that you've missed. They're also great for doing exploratory testing, so they find the things that automated tests can't (for instance, one of my favourite testers spotted that I'd put an SQL call in the wrong place and that a particular behaviour was making 10 calls to the DB where it only needed to do 1\\).\n\nI tend to refer to \"tester\" these days rather than \"QA\", since assuring quality is indeed, as gurun said, more than just one person and a bit of process."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In software development, which of the following best describes the primary role of a tester (QA) in relation to developers, especially in environments using TDD and BDD?\n\nA) To rewrite and optimize code produced by developers\nB) To focus exclusively on automated testing and test script creation\nC) To identify gaps in test coverage and explore scenarios developers might overlook\nD) To replace the need for unit testing by developers\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, testers are \"problem space\" people who excel at identifying scenarios, edge cases, and potential issues that developers, who are more \"solution space\" oriented, might overlook. Testers help spot missing tests or scenarios in TDD and BDD environments, and perform exploratory testing to find issues that automated tests might miss. They complement the developer's role rather than replacing it, and their focus goes beyond just automated testing.

I was so used to programming in Pascal that I figured if I could just make C work like Pascal it would make me more productive.

So in the case above, the null check is useless. Either `p` is allocated, or an exception will be thrown causing the property setter to be skipped.\n\nI have asked my coworker about this in passing, and I get a passive answer along the lines of \"just in case\". I don't like this kind of \"paronia\\-programming\" myself. I think it hurts the readability and needlessly increases cyclomatic complexity. Because of this, I would like to make a formal request that this practice be stopped. Is this a reasonable request? Am I missing something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I agree with @MartinMaat about picking your battles.\n\nThere are many cases of \"just in case\" due to not really understanding the language despite the language being fixed in its rules for many of these things \\-\\- over parenthesizing an expression that doesn't need it due to not understanding the precedence rules of the language. But still, such practice is mostly harmless.\n\nWhen I was younger, I felt that we should learn the details of the language and thus avoid writing such superfluous code.\u00a0 (One of my pet\\-peeves was `return (0);` with its unnecessary parens.)\u00a0 However, I now moderate that position, in particular, because we use so many different languages now, jumping from client to server, etc... So, I now cut some slack for some such issues.\n\nYou're point about cyclomatic starts to go to logically reasoned argument.\u00a0 Let's look at [Code Coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage#Coverage_criteria) and especially [higher levels of coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage):\n\n> > 2. Each decision takes every possible outcome\n\nSince we cannot force the new operation to return NULL, ***there's no way to reach higher levels of code coverage for this conditional operation.***\u00a0 Of course, this may or may not be important to your organization!\n\nHowever, because of this code coverage issue I would prioritize it higher than than over\\-parenthesizing.\n\nOn the other hand, the underlying generated code will probably not suffer one bit for this as the code generations, JIT, and optimizers all understand that a `new`ed value will never be null.\u00a0 So, the real cost comes only in terms of readability and source code coverage capabilities.\n\nI would ask you what does the \"else\\-part\" of such an if statement look like? \n\nIf there is no else\\-part, I would argue that simply falling off the end of the routine or falling through to other code (i.e. no `else` for this `if`) is potentially dangerous, since now this \"just in case\" logically suggests that callers and/or further code down the line handles NULL as well.\n\nIf it reads:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p != null ) {\n    p.field = value;\n}\nelse {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\n\n```\n\nthen this is really overkill, as the language does all of that for us.\n\nI might suggest reversing the sense of the conditional \u2014 perhaps your colleague will be more comfortable with this:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p == null ) {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\nelse {\n    p.field = value;\n}\n\n```\n\nNow you can argue for the removal of the else wrapper, since it is very clearly unnecessary:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p == null ) {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\np.field = value;\n\n```\n\nWith this, the \"just in case\" is now what is conditional, whereas the succeeding code isn't.\u00a0 This approach further reinforces that when allocation fails, the appropriate response is throwing, rather than continuing to run code in this method and/or in this call chain (without any other proper handling of the allocation failure).\n\nSo, in summary there are two logically reasoned arguments to make here against this practice:\n\n1. Higher code coverage levels cannot be reached as we cannot force out of memory (or any constructor failure) to return null.\n2. The \"just in case\" (as shown above in the question) is incomplete ***and as such is flawed*** because of the inconsistency in expectations of how null were to be handled by other code beyond/past the `p.field = value;`.\n\nFundamentally, it seems like perhaps your colleague is on the fence about using exceptions \u2014 even though there's no choice here in C\\# for such things.\u00a0 (*If we want well\\-tested code* we cannot code for both an exception model for handling null and a non\\-exception model using null\\-return\\-values, side\\-by\\-side.)\u00a0 Perhaps if you reason with your colleague through these topics, they'll see some light!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer is consistently writing code that checks for null after object instantiation, like this:\n\n```csharp\nPerson p = new Person();\nif (p != null)\n{\n    p.Name = \"John Smith\";\n}\n```\n\nAs a senior developer, what is the BEST approach to address this issue?\n\nA) Ignore it, as this practice is harmless and doesn't affect performance\nB) Immediately demand that the junior developer stops this practice without explanation\nC) Explain that this check is unnecessary and suggest reversing the condition to emphasize exception handling\nD) Encourage the practice as it improves code coverage\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best approach.

Also PDF is by design easier to display because you don't need a complex language interpreter as for (E)PS.\n\nIf you take Gnuplot and select LaTeX output, you will get some LaTeX code, which draws the plot, but this doesn't mean it is the best possible result.

I will therefore provide an indirect answer by highlighting the fundamentals (1\\-4 below), demonstrating them, and then applying them in what amounts to an equivalent proof.\n\n1. **When you add a constant $a$ to all data $x\\_i$, the mean of the new values is $a$ plus the mean of the old values.** This should be obvious, because adding $a$ to each of $n$ values adds $na$ to the sum. When the sum is divided by $n$ to get the mean, $na$ is divided by $n$ to show $na/n\\=a$ is added to the sum.\n2. **When you multiply each $x\\_i$ by a constant $b$, the mean of the new values is $b$ times the original mean.** This truly is obvious (it's a direct application of distributive and commutative laws of arithmetic).\n3. **When you add a constant $a$ to all data, the variance is unchanged.** This is because the variance is the average of the squared residuals, $(x\\_i\\-\\\\bar x )^2$. By (1\\), $\\\\bar x$ increases by $a$ and that exactly cancels the addition of $a$ to each $x\\_i$, whence *the residuals are unchanged.* Consequently the variance is unchanged.\n4. **When you multiply all data by a constant $b$, the variance is multiplied by $b^2$.** Since (3\\) tells us each $x\\_i$ as well as their mean $\\\\bar x$ are multiplied by $b$, the residuals $x\\_i \\- \\\\bar x$ are also multiplied by $b$. Consequently the squared residuals are multiplied by $b^2$ and so (exactly as in (2\\)) the mean squared residual is multiplied by $b^2$.\n\nThe equations in the question attempt to demonstrate that the mean and variance of $z\\_i$ are zero and one, respectively, when the $z\\_i$ are formed by *standardizing* the data: that is, $\\-\\\\bar x$ is first added to the data (giving the residuals) and those results are divided by the square root of the variance. Call the square root $s$, so the variance is $s^2$.\n\n**Here, then, is an alternative to the equations in the question:** \n\nBy (1\\), the mean after the first step is $\\\\bar x \\- \\\\bar x \\= 0$. \n\nBy (2\\), the mean remains zero upon division by the square root of the variance. (This should remind you of step \"5\" in the question.)\n\nBy (3\\), the variance is unchanged after the first step. \n\nBy (4\\), the variance $s^2$ is divided by the square of $s$ in the second step: but that just divides the variance by itself (step \"7\" in the question), giving $s^2/s^2\\=1$, *QED*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A dataset X has a mean of 10 and a variance of 25.

In particular the treatment of light passing through a polarizing medium is handled with two sub rules: (a) The emerging light takes on the polarization of the medium and (b) the intensity is reduced by the rule $I \\= I\\_0 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta$ (or a suitable integration thereof). Not a hint there of the measurement not affecting the subject. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nBut for most cases in classical physics it is *in principle* possible to reduce the effect of the measurement to be smaller than dominant uncertainties in the problem (i.e. the time at which an apparatus passes some critical point can be measured with an IR photogate that introduces only trivial changes in the experimental conditions).\n\nPractical instruction on making these kind of things work is one of the goals of the (often sadly neglected) laboratory component of physics instruction.\n\nQuantum physics doesn't introduce the rule that the measurement affects the measured system (despite the many, many pop\\-sci treatment that either say that outright or give that impression). What is *does* is put bound on your ability to both make an accurate measurement and avoid significantly disturbing the system at the same time. No such bound is present in the theory of classical mechanics,1 though there are practical bounds which are often (usually!) more significant than the Uncertainty Principle.\n\n---\n\n1 Mind you, exactly the same kind of bound is present in wave optics.2 Alas, many introductory treatments don't point out the places where this shows up, even when doing the wave physics. That is, they neglect to mention that the Rayleigh Criterion and the single\\-slit diffraction patterns are exactly the same physics that shows up in the HUP.\n\n2 And it is due to the nature of waves.

First, let's count how many accounts were added in last 4 months, as of Jan 12 these are roughly between [62044](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/62044) and [78338](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/78338), `78338-62044=16294`. Now if we find how many of these accounts are gone, as indicated by respective user profile being `404 Not Found`, this will give us how many accounts were either self\\-deleted, or gone through legitimate merges, or... **and this is exactly what I'd want to estimate**... or were merged as a result of detected abuse of question ban. It is of course impossible to manually scan 16K\\+ profile pages, wonder if this could be done somehow automagically?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After digging into this a bit further, I can't find any conclusive evidence that this has really helped much. \n\nIn the 60 days prior to registration being enacted, Programmers got 877 bad\\* questions from registered users, and 182 from unregistered users, making up 48\\.05% of those asked by registered and 76\\.15% of those asked by unregistered users respectively.\n\nIn the *past* 60 days, Programmers got 1221 bad questions from registered users, making up 55\\.53% of the total asked. There are some holidays in there though, so that doesn't really tell the whole story. Here's a picture:\n\n![questions by source and quality over time](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Arxzl.png)\n\nWhat I *didn't* see (but hoped for) was a significant drop in the number of questions asked. So far as I can tell, the folks asking crappy questions with unregistered accounts just registered their accounts and kept on a\\-goin' \\- the number dropped slightly *right* after the change went in, but then went right back up again.\n\nIt probably improved the effectiveness of the quality ban slightly, but you're not gonna see this reflected in account deletions, and I'm not gonna talk to much about that anyway. But, here's a picture for gnat:\n\n![User creation and deletion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVcBn.png)\n\nThe best reason for doing this is probably just the slight bit of extra resistance it provides, and the somewhat fewer headaches involved in having registered accounts (both for the asker, and the folks interacting with him). I wouldn't turn it off again, but I wouldn't encourage sites with less traffic to enable it either. \n\nAs an aside, we're working on changes to the registration system that should help to *encourage* folks to register their accounts without *requiring* it \\- this should ease the transition elsewhere. \n\n\\*closed, deleted, or down\\-voted below 0\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the data presented about the impact of implementing a registration requirement for asking questions on Programmers (now Software Engineering Stack Exchange), what was the primary observed effect?\n\nA) The number of bad questions from unregistered users dropped to zero\nB) There was a significant decrease in the overall number of questions asked\nC) The percentage of bad questions from registered users increased slightly\nD) The number of user account deletions increased dramatically\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The data shows that after implementing the registration requirement, the percentage of bad questions from registered users increased from 48.05% to 55.53% in the 60-day periods before and after the change. While the number of bad questions from unregistered users was eliminated (as they could no longer ask without registering), the overall quality did not improve significantly. The total number of questions did not show a substantial decrease, and there's no clear evidence of a dramatic increase in account deletions.

Do you view $A$ and $B$ as time varying parameters, or as inputs like $u$? (Probably the former, since you described (1\\) and (2\\) as a \"linear system\"). It's all about context. In control theory, equations (3\\) and (4\\) are the most common for a nonlinear ODE system in explicit state\\-space form. I.e. if the dependent variables and inputs are real curves like you said,\n\\\\begin{align}\nx \\&: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\\\\\\ny \\&: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\\\\\\nu \\&: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^k\n\\\\end{align}\nthen the usual situation is,\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\dot{x} \\&\\= f(x, u) \\\\\\\\\ny \\&\\= g(x, u)\n\\\\end{align}\nwhere,\n\\\\begin{align}\nf \\&: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\\\\\\ng \\&: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\nwhile $A(t)$, $B(t)$, $C(t)$, $D(t)$ would be hidden away within the workings of these functions as \"time varying parameters\" or \"exogenous inputs.\" Finally, though I think it'd be misleading, you could write $\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^k$ as $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\+k}$ to fit exactly the notation you are looking for.\n\nThis is not \"the most general system\" one can write though. It need not be explicit in $\\\\dot{x}$ and $y$, need not necessary have a real / Euclidean state (like for example if $x : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{SO}3$), and need not even be a finite state system (i.e. it could be a PDE instead of an ODE). Your equations (1\\) and (2\\) are just a very very special case.

This method avoids using logical operators (which are discouraged in some fields) and instead uses an indicator function to represent the equality of categorical variables. The indicator function converts the categorical match into a binary outcome (1 for match, 0 for no match), which can then be multiplied with joint_jt to produce the desired result.

You can measure it simply by installing it into VM and default configuration. However, when your configuration changes so does the memory consumption. You would have to do some long\\-term statistics for your workflow. In my eyes it will also differ based on the distribution you are using \\- gentoo, archlinux will probably have different results than Ubuntu, Opensuse, RH.\n\nThere is also a strategy in Linux to use all available memory. I presume you want to use the gui on system where there is not enough memory available. For that you would need to perform your own tests. You would have to see how the environment deals with low levels of memory (if it can free the used memory, can be effective on low memory systems, et.)\n\nIf you want some newer statistics for different env. you can check this Ubuntu flavors one.

These are classic, robust devices that do what they do pretty well. But their intended function is to modify small voltages a little bit to maintain relatively constant supplies for things that do not use much power, like a lot of modern low voltage logic and regulation ICs. Even the supplies that do use these regulators have things in place to kind of ball\\-park the voltage before the 7805 rounds off the top.\n\nAll voltage dropped from one end of a 7805 to the other is blown away as waste heat across some resistance. Its not a big deal for a small voltage drop for a bias supply, but you would literally be venting about half of your input power for no reason. A fairly common chopper buck circuit or half bridge switching supply could do this with efficiencies in excess of 90%. You could even make a reasonable one out of a 555 timer, a transistor, some resistors, three capacitors and a zener diode, if you just feel like you *have* to play with something."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student wants to power a USB device (5V) using a ThinkPad battery (11.1V) and is considering using an LM7805 voltage regulator.

A better alternative would be to use a USB-specific power management IC.\n\nB) The LM7805 will overheat quickly when used with a lithium-ion battery. It's better to use a protection circuit module (PCM) designed for lithium batteries.\n\nC) The LM7805 is a linear regulator that will waste about half the input power as heat. A more efficient alternative would be to use a buck converter or switching power supply.\n\nD) The LM7805 cannot handle the voltage difference between 11.1V and 5V. A voltage divider circuit would be a more appropriate solution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The LM7805 is a linear voltage regulator that drops excess voltage across itself, dissipating the difference as heat. In this case, with an input of 11.1V and an output of 5V, nearly half of the input power would be wasted as heat. This is highly inefficient for battery-powered devices.\n\nA buck converter or switching power supply, as mentioned in option C, can achieve much higher efficiency (over 90%) by rapidly switching the input voltage on and off, effectively stepping down the voltage without wasting as much energy as heat.

This policy is strictly enforced by moderators and high\\-reputation users likewise.\n\nWhile Code Review has a significantly different model than Stackoverflow, there is a common element:\n\n> Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; Teach a man to fish, you will feed him for the rest of his life\n\nAs a result of this policy, users gain significant understanding of the subject matter which results in huge learning effects, making the internet a better place not only for these single users, but for all people who read such answers. Also answers are *subjectively* of higher quality in the mean.\n\nCode\\-Only answers is equivalent to handing out free fish, and it's a strengthening factor for the problems I mentioned above. I think it's one of the reasons that FGITW *works*, that people post \"Can I haz teh codez\" questions **and receive answers**.\n\nAdditionally free fish often results in users not understanding the code they use later and when the time comes to modify it, they have \"no choice\" but to ask another Stackoverflow question, which shows similarly lacking understanding. This just amplifies the flood of questions.\n\nMoreover every so often new\\-ish users join the ranks of community\\-moderation and time and time again they come to meta asking why code\\-only answers are not deleted. I conclude they intuitively *think* that code\\-only answers **should be** delete material. And time and time again the wall \"Code\\-Only\" is an attempted answer, so it shouldn't be deleted stops them in their tracks. Even experienced community moderators with thousands and thousands of reviews under their belts say (freely adapted):\n\n> I usually either use \"delete\" or \"skip\" for code\\-only answers in the VLQQ. From a curation standpoint these answers are useless.\n\nOverall code\\-only answers are big signal that SO shouldn't want to send in my opinion.\n\nI understand that there is users, who are not good with formulating explanatory text.[1](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/262695/1803692) But I think the \"damage\" done by enabling no\\-effort users and *at best* mediocre answers is higher than the damage from explicitly putting such answers up ~~nuking~~ cleanup.\n\nAm I assessing this situation wrongly, or should we start curating such answers more aggressively (by editing or even deleting)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I tend to think repeatedly, \"look to the questions, not the answers.\"\n\nIf someone asks a question like:\n\n> I've been unable to turn on the computer. I've tried opening it,\n>  looking inside at things I don't understand. A google search on the\n>  topic didn't reveal any insight. I tried cleaning the case and making\n>  it shiny. I tried pushing the on button twice in a row really quickly,\n>  still no avail. I've been trying to study electrical engineering to\n>  help me understand what is going on, but as of yet, I've been unable\n>  to turn on this computer for the past 6 months. I'm running out of\n>  ideas. Does anyone have any suggested steps to help me diagnose or\n>  solve my problem?\n\n... and the best answer could be,\n\n> Try plugging the cord you see in the back to an electrical socket.\n\nThat could be the precise solution, and the one that gets all the up\\-votes.\n\nEven though that's not a code\\-only answer, I see it as pretty much the same thing. It's terse, straight\\-to\\-the\\-point, has little educational value beyond providing the author of the question with an immediate answer. It provides the free fish.\n\nThe extreme opposite kind of fishing rod in this case might end up going into how electricity works, starting with a history revolving around Benjamin Franklin, and then healthy levels in between these two ends.\n\nYet that would hardly be the right place and time for someone to share his/her expertise on the matter in a way that would be exposed and educational for many others. It might even be seen as a poor answer to the question and down\\-voted to oblivion.\n\nIt's why I think the more we get closer to a fishing rod answer, the more it can only be effectively provided for a reasonably general question. *\"How do computers conduct electricity?\"* Now the experts have excuses to compose very detailed answers and even *compete* to provide the most accurate and detailed response, even going into a deep background covering topics like history. They start correcting each other on little inaccuracies and getting into really expert\\-territory discussions about the accuracy of their answers. These moments, albeit rare, are when SO starts to become outright *magical*, doing something few other community sites do.\n\nThe question might even be posed in the context of someone lazy and seeking a homework solution. The context matters little to me, the experts have already been given an excuse to compete to build the best fishing rod they can. What matters is that such a question can leave something behind that may catch the attention of many and educate a whole bunch of people.\n\nSO's voting system is most effective when it's used for quality control in this kind of context, in a question where the quality of the answer is highly variable and not chiseled down to a binary \"is it correct or not?\" kind of answer based on the narrow applicability of the question.\n\nBut a troubleshooting question often wants a fast answer. Those are so narrowly chiseled down to a black and white, *\"Did the answer solve the problem or did it not? If yes, how quickly was it provided?\"* That becomes the \"quality\" metric in those troubleshooting scenarios: speed.\n\nSo I really think the problem is the question. I don't think it's very effective to try to curate answers providing terse or code\\-only answers. Sometimes they are the \"best\" answer as most would judge based on the context of the question. The question sets the stage. So I really think if we want to even find more incentives to provide fishing rods, we need to encourage questions that seek those kinds of answers."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion, which of the following approaches would be most effective in improving the quality of answers on Stack Overflow?\n\nA) Aggressively deleting all code-only answers\nB) Encouraging more detailed explanations for all answers, regardless of the question type\nC) Focusing on improving the quality and generality of questions asked\nD) Implementing a strict policy that all answers must include both code and explanations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer emphasizes \"look to the questions, not the answers.\" It argues that the nature of the question sets the stage for the type of answers it will receive.

The documentation explains that the Caucus and Constituent badges were recently added to the site.

With parallel devices, the only way you can get a NACK, is if all generate a NACK. Effectively, you have no way of verifying if the the slave received the data. You have turned a communication protocol into an unknown.\n\nFrom [Understanding the I2C Bus](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva704/slva704.pdf).\n\n> There are several conditions that lead to the generation of a NACK:\n> \n> \n> 1.

The master cannot detect if individual slaves failed to receive data, as an ACK will be generated if any device responds. This makes it impossible to verify correct configuration of each device and could lead to undetected failures. While this approach might work in some cases, it introduces significant risks and uncertainties that make it inadvisable even for lab testing purposes.

The literature I am referring to is Dunkel \\& Hilbert, *Nature Physics* **10**, 67 (2014\\) [arXiv:1304\\.2066](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2066), where as I understand it, it is shown that negative temperatures are an artefact of choosing an incorrect definition of entropy. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature) on the matter has also been amended to reflect this. \n\nThis was later challenged by similarly well\\-known scientists, in [arXiv:1403\\.4299](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4299) where it was, among other things, pointed out that this argument is actually decades old (citing Berdichevsky *et al.*, *Phys. Rev. A*\n**43**, 2050 (1991\\)). The original authors quickly countered the arguments made in the comment, by what seems to be a rigorous treatment of the matter, [arXiv:1403\\.6058](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6058). The first arXiv comment (arXiv:1403\\.4299\\) has been updated since and it still reads that \"Obviously severe points of disagreement remain\".\n\nWhat I am asking, then, is whether someone on StackExchange might be able to shed some light on the matter as to how there can be a disagreement about something that seems should be a mathematical fact. I would also be interested in hearing whether changing the definition of entropy from that of Boltzmann to that due to Gibbs might potentially change any other results. Might for example the [Wang\\-Landau algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_and_Landau_algorithm) be affected seeing that it does use the density of states and that you can never simulate infinite systems (although as I understand it, even in the present context with finite scaling you should be able to get consistent results)? \n\nEDIT: An update on the matter for those who might care. [arXiv:1407\\.4127](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4127) challenged the original paper and argued that negative temperatures ought to exist. They based their claims on their earlier experiments in *Science* **339**, 52 (2013\\). A reply was offered in [arXiv:1408\\.5392](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5392). More physicists keep joining in, arguing for [arXiv:1410\\.4619](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4619) and against [arXiv:1411\\.2425](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2425) negative temperatures.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What I am asking, then, is whether someone on StackExchange might be able to shed some light on the matter as to how there can be a disagreement about something that seems should be a mathematical fact.\n\nThe main disagreement seems to be about which *definition* of the word \"entropy\" in the context of statistical physics is \"correct\". Definition is an agreement on choice that seems preferable but is not necessitated by facts. Different people regard different things more useful, so there should be no surprise that they are lead to use different definitions in their work. There should be no objection as long as this leads to some new knowledge that is in a sense independent of the choice made.\n\nThe surprising thing is the authors of the paper claim that their definition is *the definition of entropy* and proclaim its superiority.\n\nI did not find any convincing argument in their paper to convince me that there is any problem with the standard formula $S \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega(U)$ for entropy and that their formula $S' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega(U)$ should replace it.\n\nThe two formulae lead to almost the same value of entropy for macroscopic systems, for which the concept of entropy was originally devised. This is because their difference is negligible due to high magnitude of the relevant number of states. Consequently, the standard rules that use entropy lead to the same conclusions for such systems whether one uses $S$ or $S'$.\n\nFor \"strange\" systems with constant or decreasing density of states $\\\\omega(U)$ like particle in a 1D box or 1D harmonic oscillator, their definition leads to very different value of entropy for given energy $U$ and also to a different value of temperature, since $\\\\partial U/\\\\partial S'\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}} \\\\neq \\\\partial U/\\\\partial S\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}}$. The authors say that positiveness of so calculated temperature is a virtue of their entropy $S'$. \n\nBut such strange systems cannot be in thermodynamic equilibrium with ordinary systems when they have the same $\\\\partial U/\\\\partial S'\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}}$. Why? When ordinary system is connected to such strange system, the most probable result is that the strange system will give as much energy to the normal system until its energy decreases to a value at which its density of states equals density of states of the normal system (or there is no transferable energy left). According to the principle of maximum probability, the average energy $U\\_1$ of the first system in equilibrium is such that the number of accessible states for the combined system is maximum. Let us denote total energy of the first system $U\\_1$, of the second system $U\\_2$ and of the combined isolated system $U$ (constant). If density of states is differentiable, we are lead to the condition\n$$\n\\\\frac{d}{dU\\_1}\\\\left(\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)\\\\omega\\_2(U\\-U\\_1\\) \\\\Delta U^2\\\\right) \\= 0\n$$\n$$\n\\\\omega\\_{1}'(U\\_1\\)\\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\) \\= \\\\omega\\_{2}'(U\\_2\\)\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)\n$$\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_{1}'(U\\_1\\)}{\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_{2}'(U\\_2\\)}{\\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)}\n$$\n\nand this implies the condition\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_1}{\\\\partial S\\_1} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_2}{\\\\partial S\\_2}\\~\\~\\~(1\\)\n$$\nwhere $S\\_1 \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)$ and $S\\_2\\=k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)$. The principle of maximum probability *does not* lead to the condition\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_1}{\\\\partial S'\\_1} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_2}{\\\\partial S'\\_2}.\\~\\~\\~(2\\)\n$$\nwhere $S\\_1' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)$ and $S\\_2' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)$.\nIf (1\\) holds, in most cases (2\\) won't. Since in equilibrium thermodynamic temperatures are the same, the statistical definition of temperature is better given by $\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S}$ rather than by $\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S'}$.\n\nWhen the strange system is isolated and has energy such that density of states decreases with energy, the temperature thus obtained is negative. This is well, since ascribing it any positive value of temperature would be wrong: the system won't be in equilibrium with ordinary systems (those with density of states increasing with energy) of positive temperature."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion on negative temperatures in statistical physics, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The definition of entropy using S' = kB log \u03a9(U) is universally accepted as superior to the standard Boltzmann formula.\n\nB) Negative temperatures are impossible in all physical systems, regardless of the entropy definition used.\n\nC) For macroscopic systems, both S = kB log \u03c9(U) and S' = kB log \u03a9(U) lead to nearly identical entropy values and thermodynamic predictions.\n\nD) The principle of maximum probability always leads to the condition \u2202U1/\u2202S'1 = \u2202U2/\u2202S'2 for systems in thermal equilibrium.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

This formula, known as the von Mangoldt-type formula, was stated by Selberg himself and is analogous to the well-known formula for the Riemann zeta function. The main term (d_F / 2\u03c0) T log T reflects the density of zeros, while the secondary term (c_F / 2\u03c0) T provides a more precise count.

The dissolve function would merge the districts, but the question specifically states that subdivisions need to be kept.\nB) Incorrect. While label scale functionality works well for showing/hiding labels at different zoom levels, it doesn't solve the problem of repeated state/province labels for each district.\nC) Correct. Using a Geometry Generator expression with conditional logic based on map scale allows for dynamic label placement. At closer zooms (smaller scale), it can use individual district geometries for labeling. At further zooms (larger scale), it can use the centroid of collected geometries grouped by state/province, effectively creating a single label per state/province.\nD) Incorrect. While this approach could work to some extent, it's less efficient and flexible than using a Geometry Generator expression, which handles the logic dynamically within a single layer.\n\nThe correct solution uses QGIS's Geometry Generator with an expression that checks the map scale and adjusts the label placement accordingly. This approach maintains the district subdivisions while solving the label repetition issue at larger scales."}}
