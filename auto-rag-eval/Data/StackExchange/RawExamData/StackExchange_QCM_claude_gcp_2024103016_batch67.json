Why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### This applies to Ubuntu 12\\.10 (may work with older versions)\n\nFirst you will need to check that Apache is really using `/var/www` as the website root:\n\n```\n$ grep DocumentRoot /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default\nDocumentRoot <path/to/apache/root_dir>\n\n```\n\nIf the path stated in the output is different, you should change that in PHPStorm.\n\nAlso you may not be able to place your php files there because the permissions on that folder. To solve this, jst change the permission of `/var/www` (or the correct path) to your current user:\n\n```\nsudo chown -R <user>:<user> /var/www\n\n```\n\nwhere `<user>` is your username."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web developer has set up a LAMP server on Ubuntu using tasksel and configured PhpStorm to use /var/www as the root deployment folder.

Check the actual DocumentRoot setting in Apache's configuration file using the command: grep DocumentRoot /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default\n2. If the DocumentRoot differs from /var/www, update the PhpStorm settings to match the correct path.\n3. Ensure the current user has the necessary permissions to write to the web root directory by changing its ownership: sudo chown -R <user>:<user> /var/www (or the correct path)\n\nThis comprehensive approach addresses potential misconfigurations in both the server setup and the IDE, as well as permission issues that could prevent file deployment."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/29", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/517721", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/321799/"], "docs_id": 517721, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible for Ubuntu to work with MTK6572 Dual Core ARM Cortex A7 family CPU@1\\.2GHz processor in a tablet?

That is, it assumes the spacetime curvature is given by the (classical) Einstein equation. Once the radius of the event horizon decreases into the quantum regime the approximations Hawking used are no longer valid. You would need a proper quantum gravity calculation to make any progress.\n\nIn fact I'm not sure that your concept of a particle would be a valid description either. The only discussion I've seen of this type of physics was a string theory talk describing the final stages of black hole evaporation $^1$. This was some time ago, and to be honest I understood very little of the talk anyway, but my recollection is that the final stage of the black hole evaporation left behind a string in a highly excited state. The point is that at these sorts of energies it may well be that quantum field theory is not an adequate description of matter, so you can't postulate a particle with well defined properties.

When the event horizon radius enters the quantum regime, as it would for such a fundamental particle-sized black hole, these approximations are no longer valid. A quantum gravity approach would be necessary to accurately describe the physics in this scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because classical arguments about Hawking radiation may not apply at this scale.

However, if you start at a certain value of comoving coordinates (say on $S^3$), it turns out that there is no time\\-like or null geodesic that returns to your starting point. The easiest way to see this is through a Penrose diagram for de Sitter. \n\nThe Penrose diagram for de Sitter is shown below: (from [Les Houches 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110007))\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)\n\nPenrose diagrams encode the causal structure of spacetime. Every point in de Sitter corresponds to a point in the above square, and diagonal lines at $45^\\\\circ$ angles correspond to the world\\-lines of null geodesics or light rays. Two light rays are shown above, going from the line $I^\\-$ to $I^\\+$. The 'North Pole' and 'South Pole' are antipodal points on $S^3$, while $I^\\+$ and $I^\\-$ correspond to points at the infinite future and infinite past (if you want, you can think of these as equivalence classes of time\\-like geodesics). Hence, a ray of light has 'just enough time' in the lifetime of a de Sitter universe to travel from $\\\\theta\\=0$ to $\\\\theta\\=\\\\pi$, and can't get back to its original comoving position at $\\\\theta\\=0$.

Which of the following is the most likely cause and solution for this issue?\n\nA) The data is not suitable for Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. The solution is to use a different distribution.\n\nB) The epsilon value is too large. The solution is to decrease the epsilon value to allow for more iterations.\n\nC) The initscalar value is too high. The solution is to set initscalar to a lower value, such as 1.\n\nD) The algorithm is working correctly, and decreasing log-likelihood values are expected. No solution is needed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation shows that when the log-likelihood values were decreasing, it was due to the initscalar being very far off from the correct value. The default value of 30 was causing issues, and setting it to 1 resolved the problem, resulting in increasing log-likelihood values as expected. This demonstrates that adjusting the initscalar parameter can significantly impact the convergence behavior of the algorithm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication that the data is unsuitable for Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. The issue was resolved by adjusting a parameter, not by changing the distribution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the epsilon value typically controls the convergence criterion, not the direction of log-likelihood changes. Adjusting epsilon wouldn't address the fundamental issue of decreasing log-likelihood values.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in maximum likelihood estimation, we expect log-likelihood values to increase (or at least not decrease) with each iteration as the algorithm converges towards the optimal parameter estimates."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/02", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/352584", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/197989/"], "docs_id": 352584, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Server has been running for over 1\\.5 years, with no problem.\nLast week started receiving errors and workstations freeze:\nlockd: cannot monitor \nstatd: server rpc.statd not responding, timed out\n\nServer:\nOS: Ubuntu 10\\.04\\.4\nKernel: Linux 2\\.6\\.32\\-51\\-server\nnfs\\-common 1:1\\.2\\.0\\-4ubuntu4\\.2\nnfs\\-kernel\\-server 1:1\\.2\\.0\\-4ubuntu4\\.2 \n/home x.x.x.0/255\\.255\\.0\\.0(rw,no\\_root\\_squash,insecure,async,wdelay,no\\_subtree\\_check)\n/public x.x.x.0/255\\.255\\.0\\.0(rw,no\\_root\\_squash,insecure,async,wdelay,no\\_subtree\\_check)\n\nWorkstations:\nUbuntu 10\\.04\\.x\nserver:/home /home nfs defaults 0 0\nserver:/public /mnt/public nfs defaults 0 0\n\nRan rpcinfo \\-p both from workstations and from servers both return ok.\n\nWhile lockd frozen, server is 100% accessible i.e ssh top df all return as expected.\nHowever the workstations are unable to move between desktops and become unresponsive, chrome stops functioning\n\nOn server ps \\-aux \\| grep lockd shows that the lockd process is D.\nHowever after a couple of min lockd returns to S and R, and workstations are functional again\n\nAfter enabling nlm\\_debug I see that indeed the lockd process gets stuck \n\nI notice in the below log that the lockd gets stuck for a minute 02:03:21 \\-\\- 02:04:21\n\nThis repeats when the lockd gets stuck and I found that by rebooting the \"offending\" workstation\nthe all systems return to function normally. \n\n```\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312596] lockd: request from 172.x.x.x, port=960\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312603] lockd: LOCK          called\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418685] lockd: nlmsvc_lookup_host(host='roi-lnx', vers=4, proto=tcp)\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418687] lockd: get host roi-lnx\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418688] lockd: nlm_lookup_host found host roi-lnx (172.16.16.76)\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418689] lockd: nsm_monitor(roi-lnx)\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312552] statd: server rpc.statd not responding, \ntimed out\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312565] lockd: NSM upcall RPC failed, status=-5\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312570] lockd: cannot monitor roi-lnx\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312572] lockd: release host roi-lnx\n\n```\n\nThis looks like a bug in lockd.\n\nI have spent days looking though Google, and there are a couple of similar cases but no fixes.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions to resolve this issue.\n\nThanks\nLaurence\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a similar environment with 10\\.04\\.4 ubuntu nfs\\-server serving approx. 50 ubuntu/mac os x clients (mostly 12\\.04\\.3\\), I had the same problem.

The top answer in the documentation suggests that in a similar environment, the problem was resolved by removing two newly added clients running Ubuntu 12.04.3 with kernel 3.8.0-29-generic.

If you want to grep dmesg for your message once a minute, then just add a cron job that runs once a minute and greps dmesg for your message.\n\n```\n* * * * * if dmesg | tail -100 | grep -qs \"r8152.*Tx status -71\"; then /etc/kick-realtek.sh; fi\n\n```\n\n(The five asterisks are part of the crontab format and indicate the schedule time \\& date.)\n\nOne problem with that simple approach is it'll react to *all* such messages, even old ones logged before the last reset. You could avoid this by writing a marker line to dmesg (or even using an existing kernel message like \"USB device detected\" as the marker):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif dmesg | tail -100 | awk '/r8152.*Tx status -71/ {x=1} /KICKED/ {x=0} END {exit(!x)}'; then\n    /etc/kick-realtek.sh;\n    echo \"KICKED\" > /dev/kmsg;\nfi\n\n```\n\nAlternatively you could read and remember the last timestamp of such an error message, but that's much too complex in comparison.\n\n### Live monitoring\n\nAn even better option would be to use a program that continuously receives the log messages instead of having to do periodic checks. For example:\n\n```\ndmesg --follow | ...\n\njournalctl --dmesg --lines=10000 --follow | ...\n\ntail -n 10000 -f /var/log/kern.log | ...\n\n```\n\nRegardless of which one is used, pipe its output into a loop that checks each incoming line. Run the resulting script in background, ideally you could even turn it into a system service (/etc/systemd/system/\\*.service):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n... | while read -r line; do\n    if [[ $line == *r8152*Tx\\ status\\ -71* ]]; then\n        /etc/kick-realtek.sh\n    fi\ndone\n\n```\n\n(You could use `if echo \"$line\" | grep -qs ...; then` or similar, it doesn't matter.)\n\nFinally, many server systems *already have* a program that continuously receives all log messages, such as *rsyslog* or *syslog\\-ng*. (These programs are how dmesg gets copied to /var/log in the first place.) They can often filter the log messages and run programs:\n\n* [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog\\-execute\\-script\\-on\\-matching\\-log\\-event](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog-execute-script-on-matching-log-event)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to set up a system to automatically reset a problematic USB network adapter when it encounters errors.

I\u2019ve seen external GPUs that will support three displays but they sell for far more than 13 euro.\n\nWith Apple computers it is one display to one port. Adding a GPU to a port can be considered an exception to this rule but that is because the GPU in the Mac isn\u2019t driving the display any more but the external box.\n\nHow can someone know if a display supports Thunderbolt? You need to examine the spec sheet. Thunderbolt displays are a bit rare so if that is a feature then it should not be difficult to find as it would be a selling point.\n\nI\u2019m debating on if I should give examples on what is needed to get more displays to work as that might be considered a product endorsement.

You need to specify three points with `\\tizkmark` rather than two because TikZ has no way of knowing which of the groups of words being marked is longer. If the bottom group is longer as in the first example, only two marks would be needed, but this won't work in the second example where the top group is longer, so you need to mark both the beginning and end of the top group and just the end of the bottom group.\n\nA simple version\n----------------\n\nUsing the `tikzmark` package (see complicated version below) introduces some complexity into this solution that is really not necessary for this purpose (although can be useful in other contexts). Specifically, the solution above requires a unique set of labels for each box you use. This become annoying if you are using it a lot.\n\nBy using a simpler version of `tikzmark` that doesn't use the package, you can avoid this altogether and then have a command that simply is `\\boxit` for the default case, and you can use the same set of labels each time.\n\nIn this version, the labels use the following scheme, where `<start>` is the upper left corner mark. These *must* be numeric, and the default is to start at 1\\.\n\n```\n<start> <start+1> <start+2>\n\n```\n\nNow you can just use `\\tikzmark{1}`, `\\tikzmark{2}` ,`\\tikzmark{3}` for all boxes unless you have more than one box in a single example. In that case, increase the start numbers by 3\\.\n\nNow to box the nodes, you can use:\n\n```\n\\boxit % this assumes nodes start at 1\n\n```\n\nor to have more than one box in an example, use the starred version and give the starting node number as an argument.\n\n```\n\\boxit*{<start>} % gives an explicit start\n\n```\n\nHere's the complete example showing the two boxes in the same example, and then another box using the same `1`, `2`, `3` marks in the subsequent example.\n\nThis solution works with both the regular gloss syntax of ExPex as well as the `nlevel` syntax. For `nlevel` formatted examples you need to make sure that the `\\tikzmark` commands in the glosses are *inside* the `[ ... ]` not outside of them. For this syntax I also increased the `glspace` parameter of the glosses since the spacing seemed tighter with the `nlevel` syntax.\n\n```\n\\documentclass[10pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{expex}\n\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{fit}\n\n\\newcommand{\\tikzmark}[1]{\\tikz[remember picture,overlay] \\node (#1) {};}\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand{\\boxit}{\\@ifstar\\@boxit\\@@boxit}\n\\newcommand{\\@@boxit}{\\@boxit{1}}\n\\newcommand\\@boxit[1]{%\n\\tikz[overlay,remember picture]{\n\\def\\pointlist{}\n\\pgfmathsetmacro{\\endpoint}{#1+2}\n\\foreach \\x in {#1,...,\\endpoint}\n{\\xdef\\pointlist{\\pointlist(\\x)}}%\n\\node[draw,rectangle,yshift=3.5pt,thick,\n      fit=\\pointlist,\n      inner sep=1pt,text depth=\\baselineskip] {};\n}}\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla \\tikzmark{1}Si fuera\\tikzmark{2} m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{4}un jugador\\tikzmark{5} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3} more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{6} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player\u2019//\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\\boxit*{4}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla Si fuera m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{1}un jugador\\tikzmark{2} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{3} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player'\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\n% example with the nlevel sytax\n\n\\ex[glstyle=nlevel,glspace=.7em plus .4em minus .15em] \n\\begingl \\tikzmark{1}Si[If] fuera\\tikzmark{2}[be.3.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3}] m\\'as[more] alto[tall] ser\\'ia[be.3.sg.COND] un[a] jugador[player] de[of] baloncesto.[basketball] \n\\glft If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player// \n\\endgl \\xe\n\\boxit\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![output of code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)\n\nOriginal, more complicated version\n----------------------------------\n\nHere's the original version of the answer, which requires unique nodes for each mark, and requires you to give the `\\boxit` command an argument with the appropriate label.

The entire output must travel through a single pair of wires in a slip ring. Which of the following approaches is the most practical and safe solution for this setup?\n\nA) Use multiple small buck converters wired in parallel to convert 12V to 5V directly before the slip ring.\n\nB) Use a single large 12V to 5V converter rated for 1.5 kW before the slip ring.\n\nC) Convert 12V to 120V AC using an inverter, transmit through the slip ring, then use multiple 60A 5V power supplies after the slip ring to power LED segments.\n\nD) Use a single 12V to 5V converter rated for 300A after the slip ring.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most practical and safe solution for several reasons:\n\n1. It allows for the use of a higher voltage (120V AC) through the slip ring, which reduces the current and associated losses.\n2. Segmenting the LED strips and powering them locally with individual 5V supplies after the slip ring distributes the load and improves efficiency.\n3. Using an inverter to create 120V AC from the 12V battery bank is a common and reliable approach for high-power applications.\n4. This method allows for the use of standard safety devices like GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) on the AC side.\n5. High-current slip rings (e.g., 30A) are readily available for this configuration.\n\nOptions A and B are impractical due to the extremely high current (300A) required at 5V, which would be difficult to transmit through a slip ring efficiently and safely.

For example, the resistor is often put AFTER the LED, or the diode is put the opposite way. **Why is the direction of flow often disregarded in electronics?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrons have a negative charge. Current is Coulombs per second. Coulombs are positive, so a coulomb moving one direction is actually caused by electrons moving the other direction in meta.\n\nWhen we discuss current we are discussing the flow of positive charge particles. If the flow of current is actually made up of negative particles flowing in the opposite direction it makes no difference, that is two negatives which cancel. It is just a case of math and sign convention.\n\nThe only time you pay attention to the actual carriers is in something like a semiconductor where you need to know what is happening as you travel from electron carriers in the conduction band \"holes\" in the carrier band. The holes are positive charge carriers, but that is because we are counting the absence of an electron, the actual current is still made up of many many electrons slowly drifting.\n\n**### Is current always electrons?**\n\nActually if you ever model electrical systems in the body you will find that you can accurately [model a neuron](http://www.bem.fi/book/10/10.htm) using a transistor network and such. Much of the current relates to ions like potassium. This means that you really do have motion of positive charge articles. It still is just drawn as a schematic because it does not matter what the charge carrier is as long as your schematic models the electrical properties well.\n\n**### Is the electron moving the power?**\nOften people think that your power you are sending is the electron. In reality you are sending electromagnetic signals. You can slow the speed of your signal(ie. the power) propagating down a long pair of wires(one the signal and one the signal return) by changing the dielectric between them. This means two unshielded copper wires just sitting in space will actually have their signal travel near the speed of light. Your coax cable will probably travel very close to two thirds the speed of light. The electrons drifting are a function of the electric field that is present. If you were to measure how fast the electrons are drifing you would find it on the order of a few meters per second."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In electrical circuits, the direction of current flow is often disregarded. Which of the following statements best explains why this is the case and accurately describes the relationship between electron flow and current direction?\n\nA) Electrons always flow from positive to negative, so the direction of current is irrelevant in most circuit designs.\n\nB) Current flow and electron flow are always in the same direction, making it unnecessary to specify direction in schematics.\n\nC) Current is defined as the flow of positive charge, while electrons (negative charges) flow in the opposite direction, but this convention doesn't affect most circuit analyses.\n\nD) The speed of electron drift is so fast (near the speed of light) that the direction becomes irrelevant in practical applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In electrical engineering, current is defined as the flow of positive charge, even though in metallic conductors, it's actually electrons (negative charges) that are moving in the opposite direction. This convention arose historically and is maintained for consistency. It doesn't affect most circuit analyses because the mathematics works out the same regardless of whether you consider positive charges moving one way or negative charges moving the other way.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because electrons flow from negative to positive, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because current flow and electron flow are actually in opposite directions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because electron drift in conductors is actually quite slow (on the order of a few meters per second).

I tried this with the Audio MIDI app (creating 1 aggregate device with the two inputs) of macOS and judging from the input level in system preferences it seems to work. Now I wanted to use this as the audio input in Zoom, however this did not work. It seems that Zoom somehow only took some of those channels effectively discarding one of the two microphones. Hence my question: is there some way to combine two inputs (ideally adjust their levels) and feed that to zoom?\n\nI have read a couple of similar questions (just without zoom reference) such as [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274090/mono-output-from-an-external-dac/274103#274103), but they mostly to point to Audio Hijack which looks great, but I find it ridiculously expensive for such a little task.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem with [aggregate devices in macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000) is, I think, that the different input microphones will be assigned to different channels. Zoom might pick up only the first channel of the aggregate device rather than mixing all the channels together.\n\nUsing a virtual audio device and a mixer software, one could mix the different microphones together into one channel of the virtual device and then select the virtual device as microphone in Zoom. Originally, I was thinking of [soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) (`brew install soundflower`) or [vb\\-cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (`brew install vb-cable`), maybe in addition to [obs](http://obsproject.com) (`brew install obs`) for mixing. But as [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) has been mentioned in the comments, let's try this one:\n\n> BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.\n\n1. Install the [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh)\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n```\n2. Install the [BlackHole virtual audio device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)\n\n```\nbrew install blackhole-2ch\n\n```\n3. Install a mixer software that will be used to combine the microphone sources. You can use [Apple Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) if you have it, or you can use [obs](http://obsproject.com) (free). Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get it working with [Apple GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/garageband/id682658836?l=en&mt=12), because this couldn't handle both microphones simultaneously. Here, I'm using obs.\n\n```\nbrew install obs\n\n```\n4. In obs, in the \"sources\" section, add the first microphone as \"Audio Input Capture\".\n\n[![add Audio Input Capture source](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsDzf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsDzf.png)\n\n[![select your microphone](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZjDs.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZjDs.png)\n5.

In obs, for both microphones, you need to activate \"Audio Monitoring\".

So... I tore the wall down and will be using proper wood screws to fasten the clips. It's all about peace of mind in the end. I have a company coming in a few weeks to mud the walls I put up so I can prime and paint and I don't want to keep worrying about whether or not that wall is going to come crashing down, be it on me or the people who buy my townhouse when I decide to move.\n\nMy advice: **Never use drywall screws to bear any load.** As others have already stated, they're not designed to bear load. For that type of application, use proper screws with adequate strength.\n\n**Original question below:**\n\nI originally asked this question back in February and want to reword it in hopes that I can get a more obective answer. Here are the screws in question:\n\n[http://www.lowes.com/pd\\_112628\\-10681\\-S05CDW212\\_0\\_\\_?productId\\=3198059](http://www.lowes.com/pd_112628-10681-S05CDW212_0__?productId=3198059)\n\nLate last year, I hung two layers of type\\-X drywall on a furring channel assembly for a soundproofing project. The entire assembly goes like this:\n\n* Mounted 5 rows of Genie Clips (RSIC) to studs using the above\\-linked 2 1/2\" drywall screws. There are 25 clips total in the whole assembly. The clips are 1\" thick, so 1\" of the screw is outside the stud. However, it's fastened snug against the clip, so it's not like there's exposed screw sticking out of anything.\n* 5 rows of metal furring channels (hat channels) are snapped into the clips from the top of the wall to the bottom.\n* Two layers of type\\-X drywall at 72 lbs per 4x8 sheet are fastened to the furring channels using the same screws. There are 7 sheets, so 7x72 \\= 504 lbs. This wall is suspended, so it's not touching the ceiling, walls, or floor.\n\nThe instructions said I could use drywall or wood screws so long as they're coarse thread. Only after I got the wall installed did I learn of \"shear strength\" and that drywall screws are very brittle, snapping under pressure rather than bending like wood screws. This got me worried, so I came here to see if this wall is safe.\n\nIf the math is simple, we can take the total weight of the assembly (520 lbs if you add the approximate weight of the furring channels) and divide that by 25 (the number of clips) and arrive 20\\.8 lbs, the minimum average weight capcity per screw in order for the wall to hold up without anything being attached to it (dart boards, mirrors, portraits, etc).\n\nBut I am sure there are other factors here. For example:\n\n* If a screw has a shear strength of 20 lbs, do 25 of those screws together in an assembly average out at 20 lbs each or is there some kind of cumulative increase that would allow each screw to support more weight the more screws of its kind exist in the same assembly?\n* What is shear strength vs. shock strength? I saw a video of a guy taking a hammer sideways against a drywall screw and snapping it off, but that seemed a little unfair since an assembly stays still. You don't have strong and sudden downward forces occuring within your wall, so was that video a valid demonstration of a drywall screw's brittleness?\n\nI am obviously asking all this because I don't want the wall to come crashing down one day. If I have to tear it down and remount the clips using wood screws, I will have to do just that. However, if someone can provide a convincing argument that having all this weight supported by 25 drywall screws is okay (it's not framing or anything) then I will be able to sleep better at night.\n\n**Update:**\n\nSo I decided to do the test I talked about in my original question prior to rewriting it. What you see in these pics is a mock Genie Clip assembly. It's a spare 2x4 screwed into a wall stud with 3 screws. A Genie Clip is fastened to the spare stud with one of the screws linked above. This pic shows the assembly supporting 130 lbs of weight (total of 4 dumbells weight 50, 40, 25, and 15 lbs)!\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hhMO.jpg)\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3HJ7.jpg)\n\nSo if each drywall screw can support at least 130 lbs and I have 25 clip assemblies holding up this wall, I think it's safe to say that I could probably put at least 3,250 lbs on this wall. Since it weighs no more than 525 lbs as is, I think I am more than safe. Next time, though, I will use wood screws since that's the proper way to do it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's difficult to model the situation with rational analysis, there's too many intangible factors. You could do an empirical test. You need to support 20 lbs per fastener. We can apply a safety factor of 3 for ultimate strength, so the fastener should support 60 lbs without actually breaking. So you would need 2\\-4 fasteners to support your weight. Round down to the closest whole number. Install the clips as you did in the wall, except now install a metal strap between the screw head and clip. Arrange the straps so you can step into them to weight the system. Arrange the straps such that your weight is distributed evenly to each fastener.\n\nWeight the system and see if they break. If you live in a seismic area, bounce on them a bit and see if they break. You'll either be able to sleep better or you'll know what to do next, depending on the outcome. Obviously there are better ways to set up an empirical test, I chose to illustrate a quick and dirty method just as an example. Be sure you are protected from flying shards of metal.\n\nRegarding an increaser for the number of fasteners. No, you can't do that. It is a valid concept though, for example you can use a higher allowable bending stress in multiple floor joists than you can in a single use situation such as a header. The concept is not generally applied to fasteners.\n\n**Response to OP's Update**\n\nShear strength in relation to fasteners partly depends on what the fastener is holding. In this case it's known as a metal side plate condition, meaning the expected failure mode will either be the top of the screw failing through the shank (shear) or the wood collapsing under the compression from the screw. It's rare in reality to have a perfect shear condition, there is usually some bending and tension components as well.\n\nA true shear condition would something like a metal strap screwed to the wood surface and all the force was parallel to the wood surface, exactly perpendicular to the screw shank. In your test, you mostly have the vertical shear component, but there is a tension component as the center of mass is away from the wall surface. We can safely ignore the tension component in calculating a working load since 80\\# in pure shear is more conservative than 80\\# shear and, oh... say 15\\# tension combined.\n\nA picture of the clip was helpful, I imagined a much worse condition. Either way, the ultimate strength will not be proportional to shear alone, there are other factors difficult to model, thus testing is the best approach. The failure mode you experienced is a bending failure, but your actual installation, while having a bending component, is in fact mostly a shear condition.\n\nThe duration of load is a factor. The usual allowable stresses specified in construction are for permanently applied loads. The allowable stresses can be increased for shorter durations, 15% for a few months, 25% for a few weeks, 33% for a few minutes. Meaning we should reduce the allowable load determined through short term tests accordingly. But we also don't know the ultimate load since you didn't achieve failure. Just as well, uncontrolled destructive testing can be a little too exciting. You also haven't run multiple tests (I assume) to confirm you are getting consistent results.\n\nLet's say you did run multiple tests and they all actually failed at 80\\#. When you apply the 3x safety factor, then adjust for duration of load, you end up with a working load of 20\\#, exactly what you need. Considering there was no failure experienced, and the installation does appear to be predominantly shear, I think your installation is safe. Barely. Next time around, use heavy ordinary wood screws ;)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is reviewing a soundproofing wall assembly where 25 drywall screws are used to mount Genie Clips supporting two layers of type-X drywall, weighing approximately 520 lbs total.

The expert's analysis suggests that when accounting for safety factors and load duration, the installation is likely safe but just barely meets the required load capacity.

If it involves e.g. a DC voltage source that is instantaneously connected to an LC combination of an inductor and a capacitor with zero\\-resistance wires, then no, a steady DC state is never reached \\-\\- but presumably that's not what you meant.\n\nIf, instead, you have a graph of capacitors and resistors (with at least one nonzero resistor) connected as a network to a voltage source (but not a current source, as Alfred Centauri's answer points out) which is instantaneously switched on, then you can use the Th\u00e9venin theorem to transform the circuit into a source\\-resistor simple circuit, where now the resistance of each capacitor is replaced by imaginary reactance, and the resistance of the full circuit then takes on the value of a complex\\-valued reactance. By examining the different ways that reactances can be combined in each step, it is possible to show that the reactance of the full circuit has positive real part and a definite sign for its imaginary part (depending on what $i$ sign convention you're using).\n\nThe system can then be analyzed using a Laplace transform, which will show that all the non\\-DC components are exponential transients, and will give you the decay time of those exponentials as the $1/RC$ time of the global reactance."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a DC circuit containing capacitors and resistors, what happens when the circuit is instantaneously connected to a voltage source?\n\nA) The circuit immediately reaches a steady DC state\nB) The circuit oscillates indefinitely without reaching a steady state\nC) The circuit experiences exponential transients before reaching a steady DC state\nD) The circuit behaves unpredictably and cannot be analyzed\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When a DC circuit containing capacitors and resistors is instantaneously connected to a voltage source, it experiences exponential transients before reaching a steady DC state. This behavior can be analyzed using the Th\u00e9venin theorem and Laplace transforms.

For the sake of simplicity, lets assume uniform priors on the positive part of the real axis. So that have a hierarchical model as follows: $$y\\_{i}\\| \\\\lambda\\_{i}\\\\sim Poisson(\\\\lambda\\_{i})$$\n$$\\\\lambda\\_{i}\\|\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\sim Gamma(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)$$\n$$\\\\pi(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)\\\\propto1\\_{\\[0,\\+\\\\infty]}$$\n\nNow you have a two groups of parameters: {$\\\\lambda\\_{i}$}$\\_{i\\=1,N}$ and {$\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$}. You need to draw random samples of these two groups of parameters from your posterior distribution. Although the model itself is not very complicated, you might stuck with very slowly mixing chains for you parameters, especially if your $N$ is very large (say 1000\\). \nYou can choose as your proposal normal distribution (just remember to reject properly negative proposed values) for whole set of parameters, in which case you would need ($N\\+2$)\\-variate normal distribution as a proposal, or you could use N\\-variate normal distirbution for lambda's and bivariate normal distribution for $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$.  \n I would suggest first of all to go with separately proposing lambda's and gamma parameters \\- i.e. to use Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. This would allow you to slightly decouple thouse chains.

When dealing with a large number of parameters in a hierarchical model, using a Metropolis within Gibbs sampler with separate proposals for the \u03bb's and the hyperparameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) is recommended as a first step. This approach allows for some decoupling of the chains, which can improve mixing.

This code snippet uses the `xparse` package and defines an expandable document command `\\getnumber` that extracts the numeric part of the input.

The trouble I am running into is how the CPU addresses memory. I know that the Z80 uses pins A0\\-A15 to form an address bus, but reading \"The Z80 Microcomputer Handbook\", <https://archive.org/details/The_Z80_microcomputer_handbook_William_Barden/page/n109>, page 118 (In the book, not in the slider at the bottom of the webpage), second paragraph under \"Interfacing ROM and RAM\", it says that pin A15 is used to differentiate between the CPU addressing ROM or RAM. It says that when A15 is low, then ROM is being addressed, and when A15 is high, then RAM is being addressed. Is this true? \n\nIf it is, would I be correct in saying that that would take my 16 bit address bus to a 15 bit one, since one of those address pins is used to tell if the CPU is using ROM or RAM? Wouldn't it make more sense to AND MREQ and M1 together and connect that with the chip enable on the ROM, so as to make the ROM active whenever the Z80 is in opcode fetch mode?\n\nThe reason I ask this is because I would like the CPU to have 64K of ROM and RAM, if this is possible.\n\nI'm new here, so any help is much appreciated, but if I did anything wrong, please tell me and I'll fix it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Look at the schematic on the following page. A15 is connected to the chip selects of the ROM and RAM to make that happen. It's not a function of the Z\\-80 per se \\-\\- it's a function of how the external memory is laid out.\n\nGood choice \\-\\- the Z80 was the second microprocessor I ever worked with (in a TRS\\-80\\), and the first one I was paid to develop software on (at 13 \\-\\- you gotta love family businesses)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Z80-based single board computer design, how can you achieve a memory layout with both 64K ROM and 64K RAM while maintaining full addressability?\n\nA) Use A15 to select between ROM and RAM, limiting each to 32K\nB) AND MREQ and M1 signals to enable ROM during opcode fetch, allowing full 64K for both ROM and RAM\nC) Use bank switching to alternate between 64K ROM and 64K RAM\nD) Connect A15 directly to chip selects of ROM and RAM, as shown in the schematic\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) This approach, while mentioned in the book, limits the addressable space to 32K for each memory type, which doesn't meet the requirement for 64K of both ROM and RAM.\n\nB) While this method could work for selecting ROM during opcode fetch, it doesn't solve the problem of addressing 64K of both ROM and RAM within the 64K address space of the Z80.\n\nC) Bank switching is a common technique used in Z80 systems to expand memory beyond the 64K address limit. By using additional hardware to switch between banks of memory, you can have 64K of ROM and 64K of RAM, though not simultaneously accessible.\n\nD) This method, while valid for some designs, doesn't allow for 64K of both ROM and RAM as it still uses the address space to select between them.\n\nThe correct answer is C because bank switching is the only method presented that allows for full 64K of both ROM and RAM in a Z80 system, albeit not simultaneously accessible without switching."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/07", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/156953", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/74694/"], "docs_id": 156953, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've tried three replacement shower heads from the DIY store (to replace the one that broke, which unfortunately was thrown out by spouse).\n\nI'd like one that makes a wide conical flow, so that my arms receive warm water while showering, without having to move from side to side when I'm standing under the shower.\n\nAlso, I'd like it to spray the water with a lot of force.

It processes the input string by converting specific characters (T, K, C, P, m, M, S) to corresponding letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and preserving numbers.

(Of course, here we are defining the real part of a complex vector to be a vector whose entries are the real parts of the entries of the complex vector, the real part of a complex vector field to be the real vector field whose value at each point is the real part of the complex vector field, and so on. In all cases we extend the definition of the phrase \"the real part\" naturally.)\n\nThe general rule is that it works whenever we only perform linear operations, which means multiplication by scalars and adding complex variables together, which follows from high school algebra. Thus, $a \\= b \\+ c$ implies $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(c)$, as well as $\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha c)$ for any complex number $\\\\alpha$, while $a \\= bc$ does not imply $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\\\, \\\\text{Re}(c)$ in general.\n\nIs it really so simple? Don't the textbooks do all kinds of operations, like time derivatives, divergences, curls, gradients, and Laplacians as well? If you recall the definition of a derivative,\n$$f'(x) \\= \\\\lim\\_{\\\\Delta x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x \\+ \\\\Delta x) \\- f(x)}{\\\\Delta x}$$\nyou'll see that a derivative is merely a particular example of subtracting two complex variables and then dividing by a scalar. That's true for all kinds of derivatives, so you're allowed to take any kind of derivative of both sides while preserving the desired property. There's really not much to it, which is why textbooks don't keep careful track of it.\n\nOf course, the fact that you can't multiply variables together means you need to be careful when dealing with quantities that are quadratic in the field, such as the power, energy, or momentum."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a complex electromagnetic vector field E(r,t) = E\u2080e^(i(k\u00b7r - \u03c9t)), where E\u2080 is a complex amplitude vector, k is the wave vector, r is the position vector, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, and t is time.

The curl operation is linear and involves only derivatives, which preserve the relationship between complex fields and their real parts.\nB) Incorrect. The divergence is also a linear operation involving only derivatives, so it does preserve the relationship.\nC) Incorrect. Both equalities hold true due to the linearity of the time derivative operation.\nD) Incorrect. Both the Laplacian and gradient are linear operations involving only derivatives, so they both preserve the relationship between complex fields and their real parts.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that all linear operations, including vector calculus operations like curl, divergence, gradient, and Laplacian, preserve the relationship between complex fields and their real parts.

This is why commands may appear unrecognized in the editor (highlighted in red with \"unrecognized command\" warnings) even though the document compiles correctly.\n\nTo solve this issue, one needs to create a .cwl file for the custom document class that includes references to the .cwl files of the packages it loads. This file should be named after the custom class (e.g., myDoc.cwl) and placed in the appropriate TeXstudio user completion folder.

Seriously, there isn't a single program in existence that can't be written completely DIP free.\n\nWe don't use DIP to accomplish a requirement. We use DIP so that the inevitable new requirement doesn't force a massive rewrite, recompilation, and redistribution. \n\nSo, do you need DIP here?\n\nWell there isn't much code here to go by, other than it's clear that `ShowUserInfo` knows about `User`. The question then is if we care.\n\nThink about this: `User` knows about `String`. `String` is as concrete as they come. Yet no one ever throws DIP at `String`. Why? Because `String` is stable (unlikely to change). Can you say the same thing about `User`?\n\nIf `User` is volatile (likely to change) then it's dangerous for `ShowUserInfo` to know about it directly. A change to `User` requires a change to `ShowUserInfo` if there is no DIP. A more stable interface or purely abstract class (doesn't matter which) helps protect against this volatility.\n\nNow that's just about needing a more stable abstraction. DIP can actually do a little more for you.\n\nDIP lets the flow of control go against the source code dependency. That gives you even more options to isolate against change.\n\nOf `User` and `DisplayUserInfo` which do you think is more stable?\n\nThe usual pattern is to assume the business rule classes are the most stable and the reporting / adapting classes that communicate with the outside world are less so. But, if for some reason you thought `User` was less stable you could use DIP to reverse the source code dependency so that `DisplayUserInfo` knows nothing about `User` and so is protected from its volatility. It's better to know about stable things than unstable things. What you don't know about can't hurt you.\n\nThat's the real nifty thing about those open arrows \\<\\|\\-\\- you see in UML diagrams. Flow of control goes through them backwards. That inversion of direction is where this principle gets its name. \n\nSince DIP lets you replace a uses arrow \\-\\-\\> with an implements arrow \\<\\|\\-\\- pointing the other way, you get to decide what knows about what regardless of what needs to talk to what.

Or, it does not belong to SO: it's superuser or serverfault \\-this happens extremely often.\n\nWhat I would really like is to never see those questions on SO.

And by the time I'm thinking about doing it, somebody does it.\n\nI do not want to say that I do know what bad Q is, but I'm wondering if something could be done to prevent this. \n\nMaybe an incentive to properly moderate and cleanup answers, through peer review, would counter this issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This comes across as a vague rant sprinkled with generalizations. Please, provide specifics. You generally say there are bad, unresearched questions that are being rewarded with reputation, and trivial answers to those questions are being similarly rewarded. Yet, there are no examples.

I counter and say that those questions are usually identified, closed, or migrated.

Question length, poor structure, lack of code, etc. Any or all of these could be used to prevent a given question from being asked.\n\nThere are algorithms in place to identify the worst question *askers* and prevent them from adding a new question at all. Users that habitually ask the worst questions (poorly received, downvoted, closed, deleted) can have their rights to ask questions revoked. Again, this is to improve the overall quality of questions that make it to the site.\n\nPossible duplicates are presented to users *as they are typing*, to try to prevent unnecessary duplication and redundancy.\n\nUsers with sufficient reputation are another part of this process. We have the ability to see a question and decide if it passes the threshold of usefulness. If not, we can downvote it and/or vote to close for the appropriate reason (not a real question, too localized, etc.). \n\nFinally, users with lower reputation can still participate in this process by using moderator flags. If you see a question that you think is not a good fit, you're free to use flags to bring it to the attention of someone with sufficient rights to close it. This is particularly useful for slow moving tags (or slow moving SE sites). Faster tags (such as C\\#, Java, etc.) generally get enough eyeballs to make such flagging unnecessary, high rep users will sufficiently identify and act upon these questions.\n\nThere are a number of tools already at work.

It recommends a well-known resource for compiler design (\"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\") and acknowledges that OS design is more challenging, requiring extensive study of existing systems and research.

One wire is red, the other wire was black. (I assume red is live and black is neutral.) I cut off the black wire because some of the insulation had come off. (I cut off the black wire from the point where it branched from another black wire which goes to another light.) Now only the red wire is poking through the ceiling.\n\nThe entire ceiling (not the roof), is made of thin pressed metal plates (yes metal, not fibreglass). One side of the ceiling is painted (i.e. the side inside the house). The side of ceiling in the attic is not painted. At the spot on the ceiling where the light fitting was, some of the paint has come off. When touching the exposed end of the red wire to the unpainted ceiling, the circuit breaker trips.\n\nI assume somewhere in the attic a black wire (from another light fitting, or from the cables leading down to a plug) is touching the metal ceiling.\n\nThe attic is a mess. It is impossible to walk in the attic due to the struts, rafters, beams, braces (i.e. all the wood holding up the roof). I can only \"crab\\-along\" the horizontal beams that rest on the walls. Of course I cannot step onto the pressed ceiling; it is far too thin. Pink insulation wool is lying on the pressed ceiling. The black and red cables run above the insulation wool. The black and red cables run from the distribution box, in parallel, seperated by about 3cm, until they descend down into either a light fitting or down towards the plugs. I have also noticed what seems to be earth wires. These are uninsulated metal cables. These earth cables frequently run under the insulation wool. As far as I can tell, the earth wires touch the ceiling. \n\nTo narrow down the cause, I switched off all sub\\-circuits on the distribution board.

What evidence is there that \"How do you call ...\" is, or is not, a legitimate phrasal usage or expression in English?\n2. Could it be called a dialectal variant? Why is it considered non\\-standard?\n3. How do linguists define the \"How do you call ...\" vs. \"What do you call...\" debate? Has any interest been shown in this lexical divergence between Romance languages and English?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **We are confusing and conflating these forms here:** \n\n**1\\. How do you say ... (in X)?** This is asking for a word or phrase, perhaps specifying in language X.  \n\n**Example:** \\*How do you say *you're welcome* in Hebrew? How do you say *sandals* in Japanese?\\*  \n\n**2\\. What do you call \u2026 (in X)?** This is asking for a word or phrase for something you're pointing at or describing. It may expect an answer in English, or in another language.  \n\n**Example:** \\*What do you call a *helicopter* in Cantonese? What do you call the blue thing on top of that box? What do you call that color? What do you call that color in French?\\*  \n\n**3\\. How do you call \u2026 ?** This is asking for a procedure: how do you call a waitress, a cat, a taxi. The expected answer can't be *Toots, Felix, Yellow Cab.*  \n\n**4\\. What's ... name?** This is asking for a noun word or phrase in the same language.  \n\n**Examples:** *What's your name? What's the name of the movie you saw?*\n**5\\. How do you ...?** This question can take lots of different predicates, and the answers will all include verbs. \n\nAll these forms are good, grammatical, idiomatic English when used this way. Any other uses of these forms would be non\\-idiomatic, non\\-standard, and maybe incomprehensible. \n\nThe difficulty arises when foreigners use their own grammar and thought patterns, but with English words. *Lei come si chiama?* in Italian, literally means *how do you call yourself?* and does not expect the answer *\u201cI use a cellphone\u201d*. In idiomatic English this is *what's your name?* The Italian is wired to use this form for forms 2 and 4 above, never using the word \u201c*name*\u201d in questions like those. In fact, if an Italian pointed to something and asked another Italian what that thing's name is, he would be thought facetious, expecting an answer like \u201cIt reminds me of Sally, so let's just call it Sally for now.\u201d \n\nThis difficulty cuts both ways. If you ask a Spanish speaker for his name, using form 4 above, you would say \u201c*Cual es su nombre*\u201d. He would be within his rights to answer \u201c*My name is the unique label by which I am distinguished from others in the room*\u201d. You should ask *como se llama*, but you're not wired for that, it's not one of the forms on our list.\n\n**So now to answer the questions.** \n\n*What evidence is there that* \"How do you call...\" *is, or is not, a legitimate phrasal usage or expression in English?*\n*How do you call* is legitimate in English \u2013 see form 3 \u2013 but only in the use allowed in form 3\\. Otherwise you do two things: you risk not being understood within the flow of speech, and you cause a needless proliferation of forms when we have a good one present already. I know this is getting into the descriptive\\-prescriptive debate, which is a different can of worms, but we're there anyway just by discussing the question. Your Ngram is all the evidence needed for pointing out that this is ono\\-standard. As for *legitimate*, well, that's an opinion. \n\n*Could it be called a dialectal variant? Why is it considered non\\-standard?* \nThese are two questions. First, no, I know of no such dialectical variant. Second, I have already shown why it's non\\-standard above. And indeed your Ngram shows that it's non\\-standard. There's another thing about Ngrams: in a world in which educational standards are dropping, along with IQs *pace* the Flynn effect, more and more examples of poor English are going to show up. Just because a form is standard in language A doesn't mean that it should become standard in language B, and this becomes very obvious when A and B are from different families. \n\nYour final question pair:  \n\n*How (!) do linguists define the* \"How do you call...\" vs. \"What do you call...\" *debate? Has any interest been shown in this lexical divergence between Romance languages and English?*  \n\nThe ! is unnecessary \u2013 this is a perfectly valid use of form 5 above. AFAIK, This debate doesn't have a name of its own \u2013 it's not important enough to deserve one.  \n\nThe divergence between Romance and English here is not primarily lexical, but structural. As such, it's of prime importance in language learning \u2013 as you can see by the mistakes of those who haven't paid attention. Unfortunately, most language teaching starts with vocabulary to the exclusion of structure, so they teach the *como se llama usted : what's your name* equivalence almost as a single lexical chunk on each side of the colon, making comprehension and analysis of the structures very difficult for the learner. It would be far better if they used this as an early opportunity to teach that learning a foreign language is not just \u2013 indeed not even \u2013 a matter of word lists."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the usage of \"How do you call...\" vs \"What do you call...\" in English is most accurate?\n\nA) \"How do you call...\" is becoming increasingly accepted as a dialectal variant in American English, as evidenced by its growing usage in media and speeches by public figures.\n\nB) \"How do you call...\" is grammatically correct when asking about the procedure for summoning or contacting something, but ungrammatical when asking for the name or term for an object.\n\nC) \"How do you call...\" and \"What do you call...\" are interchangeable in all contexts in standard English, with the choice between them being purely a matter of personal preference.\n\nD) \"How do you call...\" is always ungrammatical in English and should be avoided entirely in favor of \"What do you call...\" in all situations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B accurately reflects the nuanced usage of these phrases in standard English. \"How do you call...\" is grammatically correct when asking about a procedure (e.g. \"How do you call a taxi?\"), but it is not standard usage when asking for the name or term for an object, where \"What do you call...\" would be the correct form.
