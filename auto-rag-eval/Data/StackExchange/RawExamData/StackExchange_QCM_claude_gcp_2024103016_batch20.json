When using caret to train a glmnet model, seeing \"lambda=NA\" in the training log does not mean that lambda isn't being tuned. Instead, it indicates that caret is leveraging glmnet's ability to efficiently compute solutions for multiple lambda values internally. \n\nThe glmnet algorithm can generate a sequence of models for different lambda values very efficiently, without needing to refit the model for each lambda. Caret takes advantage of this by allowing glmnet to handle lambda internally, which is why it appears as NA in the log.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because caret is indeed tuning lambda, just not in the way that's explicitly visible in the log. Answer B is incorrect because caret isn't using a single default value, but rather allowing glmnet to compute solutions for multiple lambda values. Answer D is incorrect because this is not an error, but rather an expected behavior when using caret with glmnet.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how caret interfaces with the glmnet algorithm and the nuances of parameter tuning in this context."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/31", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/151895", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/31288/"], "docs_id": 151895, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was reading [this article](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/mathtext/node35.html) on the axiom of choice (AC) and it mentions that a growing number of people are moving into school of thought that considers AC unacceptable due to its lack of constructive proofs. A discussion with Mariano Su\u00e1rez\\-Alvarez clarified that this rejection of AC only occurs when it makes sense. \n\nThis got me thinking. What are some examples of theorems in number theory that require the axiom of choice or its equivalents (ie Zorn's lemma) for its proof?\n\nNote: Someone mentioned to me that Fermat's Last Theorem requires AC. Can someone verify this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If we take a narrow enough view of number theory, AC can in principle be dispensed with. Take a sentence $\\\\varphi$ of (first\\-order) Peano Arithmetic, and let $\\\\varphi'$ be the usual translation of $\\\\varphi$ into the language of set theory. If $\\\\varphi'$ is provable in ZFC, then $\\\\varphi'$ is provable in ZF. \n\nThere is a substantial extension of this result called the [Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoenfield%27s_absoluteness_theorem#Shoenfield.27s_absoluteness_theorem)\n\n**Remark:** The result could be viewed as an argument for the *acceptability* of AC. For even if AC is as a matter of fact false, it cannot lead to false elementary assertions about the integers, unless ZF already does. Thus even if one has philosophical doubts about it, one can freely use it to prove number\\-theoretic assertions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem, which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between the Axiom of Choice (AC) and proofs in number theory?\n\nA) AC is always necessary for proving number theoretic assertions.\nB) AC can lead to false elementary assertions about integers even if ZF is consistent.\nC) If a number theoretic statement is provable in ZFC, it is also provable in ZF without AC.\nD) Rejecting AC always leads to more constructive proofs in number theory.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem implies that if a sentence in first-order Peano Arithmetic is provable in ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice), it is also provable in ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice). This means that for elementary number theoretic statements, proofs that use AC can be transformed into proofs that don't use AC. Therefore, AC doesn't add any proving power for basic number theory results. This supports option C as the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because AC is not always necessary for number theoretic proofs. Option B is false because the theorem states that AC cannot lead to false elementary assertions about integers unless ZF already does. Option D is incorrect because rejecting AC doesn't necessarily lead to more constructive proofs in all cases of number theory."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/13", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/399216", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/249418/"], "docs_id": 399216, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm having a mysterious problem with Word (version 16\\.40\\) and the Adobe Garamond Pro font: Four variants of the font are installed (regular, italic, bold, and bold italic), but if I select regular, Word instead uses bold. It's as if the program can't see the regular (and regular italic) styles, except that Word itself lists all four styles in the font menu and displays the name of the font using the regular variant. It's just in the text that it's misbehaving.\n\nNo other app seems to have this problem, and Font Book reports no problems with the font. This behavior appeared only recently, as it was noticed first today in a file that uses the font and was last edited without problem on Aug 3\\.\n\nThe same problem appears with Adobe Caslon Pro.\n\nI've tried clearing the system font caches and Word's font cache. I've tried disabling and re\\-enabling the font. I've restored a previous version of Word from Time Machine. None of these has had any effect. Other similar fonts work fine, for example, Garamond Premier Pro.\n\nI have several files very carefully formatted using Adobe Garamond Pro, so I'm not eager to change the font to something that's working properly, then have to redo the formatting. Has anyone seen a problem like this and found a solution?\n\nEdited to add: This is under macOS 10\\.15\\.5\\.\n\n**Added 8/13/20:** I've now tested with a new account, but it's not revealing much, at least to me. In a brand new account, the first time I run Word the fonts are just fine. If I quit and reenter Word, the problem reappears \u2014 Adobe Garamond Pro appears only in bold and bold italic.\n\nAnother curious thing: The font menu that appears under Format\\-\\>Font (rather than the one that appears in the ribbon) shows \"Adobe Garamond Pro\" as a choice the first time Word is run, but after that shows \"Adobe Garamond Pro Bold\" instead. It also, from the second time on, has a number of font names appearing in all upper case.\n\nIf I had to guess, the first time it's run Word reads in all the font data from the system correctly. When quit (or sometime before that) it writes that data to disk, but when it reads that data in subsequently, something goes wrong. However, I haven't been able to find where that info is being written, if that's what's actually happening. It feels like I'm trying to debug MS's app for them...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's fixed. The culprit appears to have been Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and was fixed with a recent update (version 2020\\.12\\.20043\\). You may have to quit Word and restart it, you possibly have to run Reader once before the fonts work again.\n\nNot my observation, but taken from [a discussion at a Microsoft board](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/word-now-only-recognizing-the-bold-font-of-my/1424921d-8bc8-4c69-9af8-d5a21145b01b?page=5).

The documentation reveals that the issue was ultimately resolved by updating Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to version 2020.12.20043.

What I mean is, how do different combinations of GFCI and/or AFCI protection relate when applied on a circuit breaker and/or an outlet?\n\nSome combinations I've heard/thought of already are as follows, but I'm not sure how the different protection methods and redundancy between the same kinds of protection can help or hurt one another. The items in bold are the ones in particular I'd like to learn more about. How does the combination of safety devices interact with one another? Assume the circuit is grounded (e.g. connected via NM 14/2 with ground wire hooked up properly throughout.\n\n* regular breaker with overcurrent protection \\+ regular outlet\n* reg breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n* **GFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet**\n* **AFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet**\n* **AFCI \\& GFCI combo breaker \\+ GFCI outlet**\n* AFCI \\& GFCI combo breaker \\+ regular outlet\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Definitions\n-----------\n\nGFCI is intended to protect humans against severe shock or electrocution.\n\nAFCI protects structures (and their human occupants) against fire.\n\n**AFCI detects if there is an open arc** on a circuit and de\\-energizes the circuit. Electrical arcs can start fires easily if they hit the wrong material.\n\n**GFCI detects a current differential on the \"hot\" and \"neutral\" wires**. In a functioning circuit, both wires carry exactly the same current. If there is a difference in current between the wires, it means current is leaking somewhere else. The \"somewhere else\" could be through you and cause injury or death.\n\nGFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n---------------------------\n\nThis is pointless, or at least overkill. GFCI's can fail, but the electrical code doesn't require you to wire up redundant GFCI's in series. The GFCI breaker protects the entire branch circuit. Likewise, one GFCI receptacle on a branch circuit can protect all of the downstream receptacles if wired correctly.\n\nDo test your GFCI's from time to time to ensure that they are still functioning correctly.\n\nAFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n---------------------------\n\nThis will protect against fire (the AFCI will trip if there is an open arc), and it will also protect against severe human shock/electrocution. This is a fine combination and combines positive attributes of both types of protection.\n\nAFCI \\& GFCI combo breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs in the GFCI breaker/GFCI outlet scenario, the GFCI outlet is redundant and thus unnecessary to meet code requirements.\n\nEDIT\n----\n\nTester01 makes a good point about the possibility of getting shocked before a GFCI trips. You may get bit, but a properly functioning GFCI should trip within 25ms (0\\.025 seconds), at a voltage differential between 4 mA to 6 mA. Most people can feel electric shock starting around 1 mA, and it's a relatively mild to uncomfortable sensation up to 10 mA, after which it becomes painful. 10 mA is also the threshold where involuntary muscular contractions become strong enough that you may not be able to let go of the thing that is shocking you, and the current starts to become lethal between 75 mA where breathing becomes so difficult that it stops, and 200 mA. In any event, a properly\\-functioning GFCI should cut the current completely before you are permanently damaged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is upgrading their electrical system and wants to ensure maximum protection against both electrical fires and shock hazards.

Which of the following statements best describes this configuration?\n\nA) This is the ideal setup, providing maximum redundancy and protection against all electrical hazards.\n\nB) This configuration is unnecessary, as the GFCI outlet is redundant when used with an AFCI & GFCI combo breaker.\n\nC) This setup is dangerous and may cause the circuit to trip unnecessarily due to conflicting protection mechanisms.\n\nD) The AFCI & GFCI combo breaker should be replaced with a standard breaker to avoid interference with the GFCI outlet.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The AFCI & GFCI combo breaker already provides protection against both arc faults (which can cause fires) and ground faults (which can cause shock hazards) for the entire circuit. Adding a GFCI outlet downstream is redundant and unnecessary to meet code requirements. While it doesn't harm the system, it doesn't provide additional protection beyond what the combo breaker already offers. The GFCI function in the breaker protects the entire branch circuit, making the additional GFCI outlet superfluous.

Does the equation imply that the orbital velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius? So, can it be accurately stated that the orbital velocity decreases as the orbital radius increases?\n\nHowever, [this article](https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-matter) states that \"In general, the speed with which stars orbit the centre of their galaxy is independent of their separation from the centre; indeed, orbital velocity is either constant or increases slightly with distance rather than dropping off as expected.\"\n\nThese observations seem contradictory. Can someone please help clear up the misinterpretation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your understanding that the orbital velocity decreases as the radius increases is correct. Yet, as the article states, we see that orbiting stars seem to have a uniform speed. The resolution comes from the fact that the $M$ in the formula refers to the mass enclosed by the orbit (really the $M$ refers to a point mass, but an object a distance $R$ from the center of a spherically symmetric mass distribution feels the gravitational force that would result if all the mass inside the radius $R$ had been concentrated at the origin and the outside mass was removed completely).\n\nFor bigger orbits, $R$ is bigger as you noted, but also the orbits enclose more mass (mostly dark matter, as the article says), and so the orbital speed stays more or less constant.

The equation V = \u221a(GM/R) is still valid, but the mass M in the equation refers to the mass enclosed within the orbital radius R. In galaxies, as R increases, more dark matter is included within the orbit. This increase in M offsets the increase in R, resulting in a nearly constant orbital velocity for stars at different distances from the galactic center. This observation is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the equation remains valid when properly interpreted.

Moreover, it says that to know by how much an eigenvalue changes, one needs only to know the derivative of the Hamiltonian operator and the corresponding eigenvector. Is there a more fundamental interpretation at play here that I am missing?\n\nIt gets a bit stranger, when one considers even introducing parameters $\\\\alpha$ into the Hamiltonian, in order to compute average of a term in the Hamiltonian, e.g., writing $H \\= A \\+ B $ instead as $H\\=A\\+\\\\alpha B$ and calculating $E\\_n (\\\\alpha)$ we can express the expectation value of the $B$ terms as:\n$$\n\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial E(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}\\\\right\\|\\_{\\\\alpha\\=1} \\=^{FHT} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\= \\\\langle B \\\\rangle \\\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nWhy by arbitrarily introducing parameters into $H$ we can still estimate the correct expectation values using FHT? I feel I am missing some potentially basic point here.\n\nOn a mathematical side: in Eq. $(1\\),$ the averaging over the eigenstate $\\|\\\\psi\\_n\\\\rangle$ implies that the derivative of $H$ is only valid as long as $H$ is in eigenstates, right? But how can we mathematically compute such derivatives when only eigenstates are allowed? Isn't this similar to attempting to define derivatives over discrete functions?\nHow do we actually compute such derivatives (analytically or numerically)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short answer:** In general, the eigenvectors $\\\\psi\\_n$ will change for finite $\\\\alpha$. Hence, to apply the Feynman Hellman theorem correctly in your second question, you need to determine the spectrum and eigenvectors at $\\\\alpha\\=1$ and then compute expectation values with respect to these eigenvectors. \n\n**Longer answer:** \n\nYou're asking a few different questions here, so let me know if I've missed one. Firstly, on a basic mathematical level it seems that you're asking how to define the derivative of $H$ with respect to a parameter $\\\\alpha$. To do this, you can imagine choosing a fixed basis for the Hilbert space on which $H$ acts, evaluating the matrix elements of $H$ with respect to this basis, and differentiating each matrix element individually. If instead you had chosen a new basis at each value of $\\\\alpha$, you would need to specify a particular *covariant derivative* for the Hamiltonian, to avoid ambiguities associated with your choice of basis at each value of $\\\\alpha$. \n\nYour first question is not entirely clear to me, but I'd guess that you're asking why changes in the eigenvectors are irrelevant for computing $\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha E\\_n(\\\\alpha)$. Essentially this follows from the fact that eigenvectors are constrained to lie on the unit sphere of $\\\\mathbb C^n$ (where $n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space). Explicitly, \n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha E\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle\\+(\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|)H(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle\\+\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|H(\\\\alpha)\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha(\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H\\\\rangle\\_n\\+E\\_n\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha(\\\\langle\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\|\\\\psi\\_n(\\\\alpha)\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\\\langle\\\\partial\\_\\\\alpha H\\\\rangle\\_n\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nPhysically, it's related to the observation that changing the Hamiltonian of a system slowly over time tends to cause the system to move continuously along an eigenstate (as long as the spectrum is well separated)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian H(\u03b1) that depends on a parameter \u03b1.

We have a script that is used to transfer files between two SCO Unix systems. The script has been rock solid for years. Recently the firewall unit at one location failed and was replaced. We can open a VPN tunnel, FTP works and we can transfer files, but the script is getting stuck at the point where it deletes a file.  \n\nThe script writes a local file to identify that an FTP transfer is in progress (called a \"lockfile\"). The file uses the PID in the file name so the script can identify it. Then after the FTP transfer the script deletes the file as a clear indicator that the transfer process is complete.\nThe FTP transfer completes \\- files are transferred. A message is echoed on the screen to say that the FTP session is closed.\nBut the script stalls at the point where it removes the lockfile. \n\nAlso, the script supports deleting \"stale\" lock files but it cannot do that any more either.\n\nNot sure how the firewall on the target system would impact the local system, but that's the symptom. \n\nWe do not currently have a sys admin.

Soldiers are supposed to shoot, not talk. \n\nAs far as I can remember the story there's a bit of swearing on the radio throughout the whole mission, but a lot less than 3\\-4 times per level. There are plenty of levels with normal mission briefings and instructions and without any bad language.\n\nHowever, you'll probably have to stay away from multiplayer games, unless you disable voice and text chats. People in CoD are no soldiers. They love trash talk in MP games and muting them completely is probably the best idea.

The documentation clearly states that while the single-player campaign contains minimal swearing (less than 3-4 times per level), the multiplayer mode can be problematic due to other players' tendency to use offensive language. However, the game provides options to mitigate this issue. Players can mute voice chat by setting the Voice Volume to 0 in the multiplayer options. Additionally, text chat can be disabled by modifying the config_mp.cfg file.

Your bindings need to be compiled against ESRI's GDAL to work reliably. It's possible they can be made to work, but it is going to be a lot of headache.\n\nIn short, ESRI needs to provide the gdal\\_i.lib stub file that GDAL generates as part of its compilation process, and you need to build the Python bindings against that. I don't know that ESRI provides this, however.\n\nMaybe ESRI could be requested to provide a gdal.py and GDAL bindings as part of ArcPy? Alternatively, maybe you could use [Fiona](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona) and [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) to replicate the GDAL bindings parts you need. These have the benefit of not needing to link against the ESRI GDAL and instead are able to use it by doing C API calls directly into the DLL."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to use GDAL/OGR with ArcMap 10.0, a developer encounters an ImportError. What is the most likely cause of this error and the best solution?\n\nA) The GDAL version is incompatible with ArcMap. The developer should downgrade to an older version of GDAL.\nB) Environment variables are incorrectly set. The developer should modify the PATH and GDAL_DATA variables.\nC) The GDAL bindings don't match ArcMap's internal GDAL version. The developer should compile GDAL bindings against ESRI's GDAL.\nD) Python paths are incorrect after importing arcpy. The developer should manually adjust sys.path after importing arcpy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the ImportError is that the GDAL bindings being used do not match the internal GDAL version used by ArcMap. The top answer in the StackExchange post suggests that the GDAL 1.11 bindings fetched from an external source (gohlke) are incompatible with ArcMap's internal GDAL library.\n\nThe correct solution is to compile the GDAL bindings against ESRI's GDAL version. This requires ESRI to provide the necessary files (like gdal_i.lib) for compilation. Alternatively, the developer could use libraries like Fiona and rasterio that don't need to link against ESRI's GDAL directly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply downgrading GDAL may not solve the compatibility issue with ArcMap's internal version.\nOption B, while potentially helpful in some cases, does not address the core issue of version mismatch.\nOption D is not the primary cause, as the post shows that Python paths remain unchanged after importing arcpy."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/09", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/17988", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/7219/"], "docs_id": 17988, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I dont know if anyone else out there has noticed but the Helicopters in Bad Company 2: Vietnam are stupidly hard to shoot down.\n\nI consider myself quite a Veteran at the original Bad Company 2 where heli's weren't all that much of a problem with the tracer dart and rpg combo, but I am really struggling with them in Vietnam.\n\nCurrently I just chip away slowly with an LMG and hope they dont fly off the get healed.

Let $y\\\\in Y(1\\)$ be a $\\\\QQ$\\-point, then the fiber $Y(N)\\_y$ of $Y(N)$ above $y$ is a $\\\\QQ$\\-algebra $A$ of degree $d\\_N :\\= \\|PSL(2,\\\\ZZ/N)\\|$. Since $Y(N)/Y(1\\)$ is galois, we find that $A \\= \\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{k\\_y} K\\[x]/(x^e)$ is a product of $k\\_y$\\-many connected $\\\\QQ$\\-algebras, where $e \\= 1$ if $y\\\\ne 0, 1728$, otherwise $e \\= 3,2$ if $y \\= 0,1728$. Here we have $k\\_y\\\\cdot e\\\\cdot\\[K:\\\\QQ] \\= d\\_N$. Note that by the Weil Pairing $K$ must contain a primitive $N$th root of unity $\\\\zeta\\_N$.\n\nThus, we find that for any such $y$, there exists a field $K$ of degree over $\\\\QQ$ dividing $d\\_N$ such that there exists a $K$\\-point on $Y(3\\)$ lying above $y$. This means, that there exists an elliptic curve $E/K$ with a pair of points $P,Q\\\\in E(K)\\[N]$ which generate $E\\[N]$ and such that $e\\_N(P,Q) \\= \\\\zeta\\_N$. In particular, $E\\[N]$ is defined over $K$. Note that given one such pair $(P,Q)$ there exist $SL\\_2(\\\\ZZ/N)$\\-many such pairs with Weil pairing $\\\\zeta\\_N$, whose equivalence classes modulo $Aut(E)$ occupy all of the points in the fiber $Y(3\\)\\_y$ (ie, over $y\\\\ne 0,1728$ there are $d\\_N$ such equivalence classes. Otherwise there are $\\\\frac{d\\_N}{3}$ or $\\\\frac{d\\_N}{2}$ if $y \\= 0$ or $1728$).\n\nThe fact that all the points of $Y(3\\)\\_y$ is taken up by this single curve $E$ means that there is (up to $K$\\-isomorphism), precisely one elliptic curve $E$ with $E\\[N]$ defined over $K$ (this is the *special twist* I was referring to in the OP). This elliptic curve is precisely the fiber of the universal elliptic curve $\\\\mathcal{E}(N)$ over $Y(N)$ at the $K$\\-point, which indeed implies that all fibers of $\\\\mathcal{E}(N)$ with a particular $j$\\-invariant are isomorphic.\n\nLastly, in the OP I had said that the algebras $F^d$ are degree $d\\_N$ over $\\\\QQ$. This is incorrect. They are actually degree $2d\\_N$ (the map from $\\\\mathcal{M}\\_{1,1}$ to $Y(1\\)$ is degree \"one half\").\n\nIf we do a little relabeling and say that the scheme of full level\\-$N$ structures on $E^d/\\\\QQ$ is a galois $\\\\QQ$\\-algebra $B^d$ of degree $2d\\_N$, then $B \\= \\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{k\\_y} F^d\\[x]/(x^e)$, then again we find that since there must be a unique elliptic curve $E'$ over $F^d$ (up to $F^d$\\-isomorphism) whose full level\\-$N$ structures occupy all the $F^d$ points of $Y(N)\\_y$, that this elliptic curve must be $E^d$, and thus $F^d \\= K(\\\\sqrt{d})$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a submersion f: M \u2192 N that defines a foliation of M.

So what have I neglected? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I started trying to puzzle this one out and wonder if I fully understand what you are looking for, but I'll throw in my two cents anyway.\n\nYou can use the \"girls' and boys'\" example in at least two cases. One would be as in the team the girls are a part of and the team the boys are a part of as separate entities. Most likely because they are segregated by gender and the two groups (the boys and girls) both have their own team, distinct from the other. While in this case you would likely write \"The girls' and boys' teams,\" I have seen it in singular form many times.\n\nThe original example is similarly noted [here](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/compound-possession) as being **compound possession vs separate possession**, that is, two owners of the same thing or two owners of two instances of a thing. The author then also give a counterexample where the object possessed (religious beliefs, in her example) are of the same type, but different instances. Both Hinduism and Christianity are \"religious beliefs\" but distinct from one another.\n\nEchoed [here](https://writingtips.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/possessive-with-two-nouns/), referencing *The Chicago Manual of Style*.\n\nThe second way would be if the writer is referring to two specific groups (known to the reader) of girls and boys that are forming one team. That is: \"The girls' (of class A) and the boys' (of class B) team\" I imagine though that this would be unlikely to be phrased as such and instead would be combined into a plural noun. i.e.: \"The students' team...\" There would also likely be more context before or after the sentence to explain which two groups are the subjects. This is another instance of joint possession, but while unorthodox, could be understood by the reader if they have proper context.\n\nThose might be stretching because there are easier ways to phrase them, but they would probably be understood with foreknowledge."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the phrase \"the girls' and boys' team,\" which of the following best explains the grammatical structure and meaning?\n\nA) It refers to two separate teams, one for girls and one for boys, with incorrect apostrophe placement\nB) It refers to a single team shared by both girls and boys, demonstrating compound possession\nC) It refers to two distinct groups (girls and boys) forming one team, showing separate possession\nD) It is grammatically incorrect and should always be written as \"the girls' and boys' teams\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"the girls' and boys' team\" demonstrates compound possession, where both girls and boys jointly possess or are part of a single team. This structure is grammatically correct when referring to a shared entity. Option A is incorrect because the apostrophe placement is actually correct for this meaning.

The paper deals with the mathematic reason nicely, what you are looking for is a physical sense of what is being said in the mathematics.\n\nWhat is comes down to is that the H field is supported by induced currents in the walls and the E field is supported by induced voltages in the walls and in order for the wave to propagate these must reinforce each other, but in a single conductor system they cancel each other. The solution? If you have separate conductors then you can shape them to have the Voltage and Current in the conductors reinforce each other.

In single-conductor waveguides, the induced voltages and currents tend to cancel each other out, preventing TEM mode propagation. Two-conductor waveguides, such as coaxial cables or parallel plate waveguides, allow for the shaping of conductors so that voltages and currents in the conductors reinforce each other. This reinforcement is crucial for TEM mode propagation, as it enables the necessary capacitive and inductive coupling between the conductors. Option C correctly captures this concept, explaining that separate conductors are needed to support the reinforcing voltage and current distributions required for TEM modes."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/12/06", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/95223", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/31508/"], "docs_id": 95223, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The new Season 3 item [Twin Shadows](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Twin_Shadows) has the following active:\n\n```\nUnique Active: Hunt - Summons 2 invulnerable ghosts for 6 seconds to seek the \ntwo nearest enemy champions.

The item's ghosts were unable to detect champions like Teemo and Twitch while they were in stealth, indicating that the active ability of Twin Shadows cannot interact with stealthed units. This is consistent with many stealth mechanics in the game, which often provide immunity to certain types of detection. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest Twin Shadows can reveal stealthed champions, which the testing disproves.

The issue described in the documentation is related to how stderr is being redirected when using logrotate with the copytruncate option.

The user should download the driver again using apt-get and then reboot the system.\n\nC) The iwlwifi module is not loaded. The user should download the firmware, unload conflicting modules, and then load the iwlwifi module using modprobe commands.\n\nD) The network interface is disabled in BIOS. The user should enter BIOS settings and enable the WiFi adapter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely reason for the issue is that the iwlwifi module is not loaded, even though the driver is installed. The correct sequence of steps involves downloading the firmware, unloading potentially conflicting modules, and then loading the iwlwifi module. This process ensures that the correct driver is installed and properly loaded as a kernel module. Option A is incomplete, B doesn't address the module loading issue, and D is not supported by the information given in the documentation."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/30", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/535874", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/206011/"], "docs_id": 535874, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Just as the title said I need to fill some space in different figures (created using `pspicture`) but I do not know how to do it when the space is not delimited by straight lines.

The key information is in the edit at the end of the user's post, where they mention using ntfs-config to configure automount of the NTFS partition solved their issue. \n\nWhile option C (adding a \"force user\" line) is a valid Samba configuration technique that can help in some sharing scenarios, it doesn't directly address the NTFS mounting issue described.\n\nOption A (formatting to ext4) might work but is unnecessary and would erase all data on the drive. \n\nOption B (using Nautilus) was already tried and didn't solve the problem for the NTFS drive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, using ntfs-config to properly configure the automount of the NTFS partition, which resolved the issue according to the user's update."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/04", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/106883", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/13747/"], "docs_id": 106883, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a big LaTeX table that I want modify it in Excel, is there any solution?\n\nThere is some good solutions for converting Excel table to Latex tables.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I know there exists no solution you want, even if you want to merge cells.\n\nThe only thing that exists is [excel2latex](http://ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex), but I never saw a result of this Excel macro that has not to be reworked.\n\nPerhaps a pretty printing of your table could help you.

Someone just skipped the last step in drywall repair, and proceeded to paint. The wonderful thing about drywall is that when you screw up, you can generally fix it without starting over.\n\nAs another poster suggested, you just need to feather everything out, and sand. I'm not a pro drywaller, but I'd *think* you could get away with just one application of mud\\+sanding.\n\nCheck out this guy on youtube, who gives pretty good advice on drywalling techniques. I'd highly recommend youtube for something like this, as it's hard to describe drywall techniques in words or even pictures.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=BUcT5LHmA7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUcT5LHmA7w)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner discovers an improperly finished drywall repair on a painted wall, as shown in the image.

This approach addresses the problem without unnecessary work or expense.\n\nOption A is excessive, as replacing the entire drywall panel is unnecessary for this type of surface-level repair. Option B uses too much joint compound, which could create new texture issues and requires repainting the entire wall.

That was my answer till this afternoon! \"Mathematics without proofs isn't really mathematics at all\" probably was my longer answer. Yet, I am a mathematics educator who was one of the panelists of a discussion on \"proof\" this afternoon, alongside two of my mathematician colleagues, and in front of about 100 people, mostly mathematicians, or students of mathematics. What I was hearing was \"death to Euclid\", \"mathematics is on the edge of a philosophical breakdown since there are different ways of convincing and journals only accept one way, that is, proof\", \"what about insight\", and so on. I was in a funny and difficult situation. To my great surprise and shock, I should convince my mathematician colleagues that proof is indeed important, that it is not just one ritual, and so on. Do mathematicians not preach what they practice (or ought to practice)? I am indeed puzzled! \n\n**Reaction**: Here I try to explain the circumstances leading me to ask such \"odd\" question. I don't know it is MO or not, but I try. That afternoon, I came back late and I couldn't go to sleep for the things that I had heard. I was aware of the \"strange\" ideas of one of the panelist. So, I could say to myself, no worry. But, the greatest attack came from one of the audience, graduated from Princeton and a well\\-established mathematician around. \"Philosophical breakdown\" (see above) was the exact term he used, \"quoting\" a very well\\-known mathematician. I knew there were (are) people who put their lives on the line to gain rigor. It was four in the morning that I came to MO, hoping to find something to relax myself, finding the truth perhaps. Have I found it? Not sure. However, I learned what kind of question I cannot ask! \n\n**Update:** The very well\\-known mathematician **who I mentioned above** is John Milnor. I have checked the \"quote\" referred to him with him and he wrote \n\n> **\"it seems very unlikely that I said that...\".**\n\nHere is his \"impromptu answer to the question\" (this is his exact words with his permission):\n\n> Mathematical thought often proceeds from a confused search for what is true to a valid insight into the correct answer. The next step is a careful attempt to organise the ideas in order to convince others.BOTH STEPS ARE ESSENTIAL. Some mathematicians are great at insight but bad at organization, while some have no original ideas, but can play a valuable role by carefully organizing convincing proofs. There is a problem in deciding what level of detail is necessary for a convincing proof\\-\\-\\-but that is very much a matter of taste.\n> \n> \n> **The final test is certainly to have a solid proof. All the insight in the world can't replace it.** One cautionary tale is Dehn's Lemma. This is a true statement, with a false proof that was accepted for many years. When the error was pointed out, there was again a gap of many years before a correct proof was constructed, using methods that Dehn never considered.\n> \n> \n> It would be more interesting to have an example of a false statement which was accepted for many years; but I can't provide an example.\n\n*(emphasis added by YC to the earlier post)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was not going to write anything, as I am a latecomer to this masterful troll question and not many are likely going to scroll all the way down, but Paul Taylor's call for Proof mining and Realizability (or Realisability as the Queen would write it) was irresistible.\n\nNobody asks whether numbers are just a ritual, or at least not very many mathematicians do. Even the most anti\\-scientific philosopher can be silenced with ease by a suitable application of rituals and theories of social truth to the number that is written on his paycheck. At that point the hard reality of numbers kicks in with all its might, may it be Platonic, Realistic, or just Mathematical.\n\nSo what makes numbers so different from proofs that mathematicians will fight a meta\\-war just for the right to attack the heretical idea that mathematics could exist without rigor, but they would have long abandoned this question as irrelevant if it asked instead \"are numbers just a ritual that most mathematicians wish to get rid of\"? We may search for an answer in the fields of sociology and philosophy, and by doing so we shall learn important and sad facts about the way mathematical community operates in a world driven by profit, but as mathematicians we shall never find a truly satisfactory answer there. Isn't philosophy the art of never finding the answers?\n\nInstead, as mathematicians we can and should turn *inwards*. How are numbers different from proofs? The answer is this: **proofs are irrelevant but numbers are not**. This is at the same time a joke and a very serious observation about mathematics. I tell my students that proofs serve two purposes:\n\n1. They convince people (including ourselves) that statements are true.\n2. They convey intuitions, ideas and techniques.\n\nBoth are important, and we have had some very nice quotes about this fact in other answers. Now ask the same question about numbers. What role do numbers play in mathematics? You might hear something like \"they are what mathematics is (also) about\" or \"That's what mathematicians study\", etc. Notice the difference? Proofs are for people but numbers are for mathematics. We admit numbers into mathematical universe as first\\-class citizen but we do not take seriously the idea that proofs themselves are also mathematical objects. We ignore proofs as mathematical objects. Proofs are irrelevant.\n\nOf course you will say that logic takes proofs very seriously indeed. Yes, it does, but in a very limited way:\n\n* It mostly ignores the fact that we use proofs to convey ideas and focuses just on how proofs convey truth. Such practice not only hinders progress in logic, but is also actively harmful because it discourages mathematization of about 50% of mathematical activity. If you do not believe me try getting funding on research in \"mathematical beauty\".\n* It considers proofs as syntactic objects. This puts logic where analysis used to be when mathematicians thought of functions as symbolic expressions, probably sometime before the 19th century.\n* It is largely practiced in isolation from \"normal\" mathematics, by which it is doubly handicapped, once for passing over the rest of mathematics and once for passing over the rest of mathematicians.\n* Consequently even very basic questions, such as \"when are two proofs equal\" puzzle many logicians. This is a ridiculous state of affairs.\n\nBut these are rather minor technical deficiencies. The real problem is that *mainstream* mathematicians are mostly unaware of the fact that proofs can and should be first\\-class mathematical objects. I can anticipate the response: proofs are in the domain of logic, they should be studied by logicians, but normal mathematicians cannot gain much by doing proof theory. I agree, normal mathematicians cannot gain much by doing *traditional* proof theory. But did you know that proofs and computation are intimately connected, and that every time you prove something you have also written a program, and vice versa? That proofs have a homotopy\\-theoretic interpretation that has been discovered only recently? That proofs can be \"mined\" for additional, hidden mathematical gems? This is the stuff of *new* proof theory, which also goes under names such as Realizability, Type theory, and Proof mining.\n\nImagine what will happen with mathematics if logic gets boosted by the machinery of algebra and homotopy theory, if the full potential of \"proofs as computations\" is used in practice on modern computers, if completely new and fresh ways of looking at the nature of proof are explored by the brightest mathematicians who have vast experience outside the field of logic? This will necessarily represent a major shift in how mathematics is done and what it can accomplish.\n\nBecause mathematicians have not reached the level of reflection which would allow them to accept **proof relevant mathematics** they seek security in the mathematically and socially inadequate dogma that a proof can only be a finite syntactic entity. This makes us feeble and weak and unable to argue intelligently with a well\\-versed sociologist who can wield the weapons of social theories, anthropology and experimental psychology.\nSo the best answer to the question \"is rigor just a ritual\" is to study rigor as a *mathematical concept*, to quantify it, to abstract it, and to turn it into something new, flexible and beautiful. Then we will laugh at our old fears, wonder how we ever could have thought that rigor is absolute, and we will become the teachers of our critics."}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form exam question based on the provided text:\n\nQuestion: According to the answer, what is the main issue with how mathematicians currently view proofs?\n\nA) Proofs are not considered important in mathematics\nB) Proofs are seen as purely syntactic objects without deeper meaning\nC) Proofs are not accepted as first-class mathematical objects\nD) Proofs are overemphasized at the expense of mathematical intuition\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key argument in the answer is that mainstream mathematicians do not view proofs as first-class mathematical objects, unlike numbers.

It requires only common tools (hammer and screwdriver) and is relatively straightforward.\nC) Drilling a hole would cause permanent damage to the door and is unnecessary given other options.\nD) While a locksmith could likely solve the problem, it would be more time-consuming and expensive than the hinge pin removal method, which can be done immediately with household tools."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/12/11", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/173501", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/41025/"], "docs_id": 173501, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to change the background colour of a QGIS project using python.\n\nI can change the colour using the GUI via the Project Properties dialog:\n[![Project Properties dialog](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqgTl.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqgTl.png)\n\nHowever, I cannot find the equivalent setting in the Python API.

The software block I am using called 'Custom Variable Mass 6DOF (Euler Angles)'. This [link provides the documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/aeroblks/customvariablemass6dofeulerangles.html) of the simulation block which uses the 6 DoF.\n\nI am trying to intuitively understand the two equations of this block, namely, the translational equations and rotational equations of motion. If you scroll down in the 'Algorithms' section on the linked webpage, you can see these two equations the translational and rotational equations given as follows.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2dDh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2dDh.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cI6mM.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cI6mM.png)\n\nIn the translational equation, I see the term $V\\_{re}$. I understand that is the velocity of mass flow relative to body. But in the rotational equation, I don't see a similar corresponding term such as the 'relative angular velocity $\\\\omega\\_{re}$'. I thought the mass flow has it own angular velocity and angular momentum when it is added or ejected from the body. Why does the rotational equation not include the relative angular velocity of the mass flow?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Two spherical objects A and B are at rest in empty space and are charged in such a way that the net force between them (gravitational and electromagnetic) is exactly zero.\n\nDale's answer seems to suggest that this isn't possible in general relativity because gravity isn't a force, but I think that's wrong, or at least misleading.\n\nIf the cosmological constant is zero, there's [a family of exact solutions to GR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhansu_Datta_Majumdar#Majumdar%E2%80%94Papapetrou_solution) describing black holes at relative rest with their charges and masses proportional such that there is no net relative force between them. There's no reason (I think) that you couldn't replace the black holes with lumps of ordinary matter.\n\nIf the cosmological constant is positive, then in addition to the usual attractive force, there is an effective repulsive force proportional to $r$ (not $1/r^2$). It should be possible in principle to counter this by decreasing the charge on the bodies, though not realistically in practice since it would be an unstable equilibrium. I'll assume for the rest of this answer that it is possible.\n\n> After a certain period of time, the space between the two objects is measured to have expanded.\n\nNo, it won't expand. This is the key misunderstanding. We constructed this system to be static, and static it is. The distance between the objects will not change over time.\n\nThe only reason the universe is expanding is that (for unknown reasons, possibly related to inflation) it was expanding in the past, and it wasn't dense enough for gravity to stop and reverse the outward inertia. In recent times, the repulsive force due to the cosmological constant has become large enough to be important, but we countered that too in this system. There's nothing else that would make the distance between the objects increase. The universe doesn't *want* to expand. There is no physical process that enforces the expansion by inserting space between objects.

The system described is a static solution in General Relativity, known as the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution when the cosmological constant is zero. In this scenario, the objects are carefully balanced so that there is no net force between them, and they will remain at a constant distance from each other indefinitely. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the expansion of the universe does not automatically cause expansion between objects that are gravitationally or electromagnetically bound. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the gravitational attraction is precisely balanced by the electromagnetic repulsion in this scenario.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the net force between the objects is zero, so there is no contraction of space between them.\n\nThis question tests understanding of General Relativity concepts, static solutions in cosmology, and common misconceptions about universal expansion."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/04/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/129538", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/39101/"], "docs_id": 129538, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: i know that CDN is just for static contents. but then i still have to spread out by apache servers to all corners of the world right? so when i have done it, why dont i just set up some dedicated apache servers in place only serving static content just like CDN?\n\nare there real benefits from still using CDN compared to that scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A CDN is used for any content that is going to be accessed a multitude of times in a lot of various locations. YouTube for example, uses a CDN.\n\nThe main advantage of a CDN is that you have a local Point of Presence for the majority of your internet users. If you notice that you're getting a lot of traffic from North America and England and Brazil, there's no way that all of them are getting an optimum experience, because if your servers are located in New Zealand, then they're all going to access at different speeds.\n\nBy putting your servers in the countries where you get the majority of your traffic from, and then directing the user to their closest server, you're eliminating a lot of potential bottlenecks.\n\nSimply having \"some dedicated servers only serving static content\" does not alleviate this issue, as all your servers are going to be in the same place. If you're going to spread your servers out around the world, then your two scenarios are the same.\n\nAll that said, I would never bother to build my own CDN unless I was someone the size of YouTube or Facebook. There are a few providers out there who already have a massive, robust network that you can use.

Using an established CDN provider offers the best balance of performance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of implementation.
