Consider the following question from the 2012 Stack Overflow Town Hall Chat, [asked by Michael Mrozek](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/136111/155826):\n\n> A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?\n\nYour past, present, and future behavior will all be seen in a different light, since your username, and the diamond, are attached to all of your questions, answers, comments, close votes, reopen votes, deletes, and undeletes. I've experienced first\\-hand how my actions have been interpreted much differently than on sites where I'm a regular user.\n\nBut many moderators also contribute regularly on other Stack Exchange sites where they are not moderators, where they do not carry a diamond by their names. The question is, if a moderator visits another site, how are his or her actions perceived by that community? If that moderator makes a statement in a comment on that site, does his or her words carry extra weight and have more of an effect on that community, whether it be positive or negative? Is this something that moderators should be mindful of when participating on other Stack Exchange sites, or should a moderator just act like a normal, everyday user on a site he or she does not moderate? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd guess that the vast majority of users will never notice that a specific user is a moderator on another site. There are over 200 moderators on SE, without the diamond most users won't be able to identify them. Moderators don't have diamonds on other sites, and most users likely don't know many moderators at all. Between closely related sites the chance is much higher that users know the moderators of their sister sites.\n\nAs long as you don't explicitly mention it, most users will probably never know that you're a moderator on another site. I don't think moderators need to act any different on sites where they don't have a diamond than normal users.\n\nThere is one exception, and that is that other moderators are likely to know that you are a moderator somewhere.

What is the most likely impact of this action on the community and the moderator's effectiveness?\n\nA) It will enhance the moderator's credibility and positively influence the discussion on Site B\nB) It will have no significant impact as most users don't recognize moderators from other sites\nC) It may be perceived as an abuse of authority and potentially undermine the local moderation team\nD) It will prompt Site B to automatically grant the user moderator privileges\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and consideration of real-world implications. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"most users will probably never know that you're a moderator on another site\" unless you explicitly mention it.

The question highlights that moderator actions are \"seen under a different light\" and can be \"interpreted much differently\" than those of regular users.

The documentation suggests that moderators should act like \"normal, everyday user[s] on a site he or she does not moderate.\" Mentioning moderator status goes against this principle.\n\n4. While option B might seem plausible based on the statement that \"most users likely don't know many moderators at all,\" the explicit mention of moderator status negates this anonymity.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because using moderator status from one site to influence discussions on another could be seen as overstepping boundaries and may not be viewed positively.\n\n6.

Part of this re\\-evaluation led to the creation of a brand new Windows API, called WinRT, that is entirely native code and this meant the old extensions were no longer useful, so Microsoft developed their C\\+\\+ extensions to one that made working with the new WinRT API easier \\- by keeping a few extensions from C\\+\\+/CLI (such as the ^).\n\nSo \\- there you go, 3 different versions of an extended C\\+\\+ that is superficially C\\+\\+.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Standard C++11 is portable across different platforms, allowing the core application logic to be written once and used everywhere.\n2. Conditional compilation (e.g., using #ifdef directives) can be used to include Windows-specific code only when compiling for Windows targets, allowing the use of WinRT API features when available without compromising portability.\n3.

It's also possible that this is a question better suited for a computer science stack exchange.\n\nThe final application will be: given some set of coordinates on a sphere (i.e. the border of a country), find the minimum bounding circle on the sphere. I can imagine this is a problem that mapping software has figured out (like when you search for a country on Google Earth and it rotates the planet to perfectly center it). We can also safely assume that all of the points are contained within a hemisphere of the sphere, and in reality these points are a lot closer together than that.\n\nI've tried to think through it logically, and I believe I'm approaching a rudimentary solution. A \"circle on a sphere\" is better represented by a plane's intersection with the sphere, and there are known simple algorithms for determining if a point in 3D space is above or below a plane. So we need to find the \"best fit\" plane where all of the points are \"above\" the plane, from the viewpoint of the center of the sphere. It seems most logical to define the plane in terms of the three variables, none of which can be fixed:\n\n1. `\u03c6` \\- latitude \\[0, \u03c0/2]\n2. `\u03bb` \\- longitude \\[\\-\u03c0, \u03c0]\n3. `h` \\- height from center of sphere (0, r)\n\nSo when we define it in terms of these variables, we're looking for a plane with the maximum value of `h`. I can imagine the algorithm would iteratively look at every point, and when a point lies under the plane, it would move the plane to bring that point above it (or ON the plane), slightly widening the circle in the process. But this process of adjusting the plane is not as trivial as I originally thought, and a simple solution would not produce the minimum bounding circle.\n\nAs I said, I apologize in advance for the likely duplicate question; I'm pretty sure this is a solved problem, and I am hoping the answer is just a link to a Wikipedia article or previous answered question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Use [**stereographic projection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection) $P$ with center the North pole $N$ mapping any point $M$ of the unit sphere onto $P(M)\\=M'$ into its equatorial plane with property:\n\n$$N,M,M' \\\\ \\\\text{aligned}\\\\tag{1}$$\n\nOne of the main properties of this transformation is that circles on the sphere are mapped onto circles into the equatorial plane.\n\nTherefore the principle is to transform the set of points $P\\_k$s on the sphere onto a set of points $P'\\_k$s on the equatorial plane, determine the smallest enclosing circle of these points, and then send it back on the sphere.\n\nThe transformation formula (1\\) can be given an analytical form : $$\\\\begin{cases}x'\\&\\=\\&\\\\frac{x}{1\\-z}\\\\\\\\y'\\&\\=\\&\\\\frac{y}{1\\-z}\\\\end{cases}$$\n\nThe inverse transform can be given the following form\n\n$$\\\\begin{cases}x\\&\\=\\&2x'/D\\\\\\\\y\\&\\=\\&2y'/D\\\\\\\\z\\&\\=\\&(\\-1\\+x^2\\+y^2\\)/D \\\\end{cases} \\\\ \\\\text{with} \\\\ D:\\=1\\+x^2\\+y^2$$\n\ndue to relationship:\n\n$$\\\\vec{NM'}\\=2 \\\\dfrac{\\\\vec{NM}}{\\\\\\|NM\\\\\\|^2}$$\n\nRemark: the stereographic projection is a particular case of an inversion, i.e. , the inversion with center $N$ and power $2$."}, "answer": "Certainly!

It allows for precise, controlled displacement of vector data points, which is ideal for separating left and right side observations from an aerial survey. This technique preserves the relative positions and counts of the animals while improving visual clarity.\n\nOption A (random displacement) would introduce unnecessary inaccuracy and potentially obscure patterns in the data. Option C (heat map) would lose the discrete point data, which is important for accurate counts.

I like the job for many reasons:\n\n* I do interesting work on a cool product\n* I solve challenging problems and use a lot of high\\-level skills (quantitative, creative, writing, presenting)\n* It pays well\n\nThe problem is that I feel I need a more relaxed atmosphere (shorter hours, less performance pressure, and more flexibility), in order to free up time for other pursuits and reduce stress. The ideal would be a job that's around 30\\-35 hours a week, where there is flexibility to work more or less in a given week. **Can anyone suggest where to look for a job like this, where I wouldn't have to sacrifice too much on the above points?** (Obviously I would have to sacrifice pay.) My employer does not generally offer part\\-time employment.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is when I did summer internships at my university's CS department. The work was very intellectually challenging, but if I needed to go home a couple hours early or get flexibility on a due date, nobody batted an eyelash. However, I'd like to find out if there are alternatives to academia since from what I've seen the pay there is a gigantic drop from what I'm currently making.\n\nI've done freelance development before, but I do like that as an employee of a large company I have a lot of things taken care of for me (e.g. benefits and guaranteed stable employment).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm doing 30hrs/week jobs for more than a decade now. In my experience you will not find a niche in the industry where part\\-time jobs are waiting for you to grab one. Instead, you will have to carve such a job out of the common job market. That's not easy, because many only bargain for money when they interview, so companies are not used to employers wanting to work less, but it's not impossible.\n\nI have found the following important when looking for a part\\-time job:\n\n* ***Be good at what you do.*** When you are good, they will want you, and are prepared to pay for it. Some candidates will want more money, some will want more holidays, a few will want fewer working hours.\n* In an interview, explicitly ***ask about a company's overtime policy***. Is overtime something normal at the shop, that's done by everyone regularly? Unpaid? If so, you will be unlikely to really be working less than 40hrs, no matter what contract you sign.\n* If you have the feeling they might be hard to convince to let you work 30hrs, ***start out offering less*** (20hrs?) and then let yourself be \"persuaded\" to work 30hrs. `:)` I did this with my first part\\-time job.\n* ***Don't expect too much pay*** or other benefits when you first do this. Under these conditions you are closer to a junior job than you used to be. Once you can show excellent references for two or three such jobs over the last decade it will be easier to convince employers that your special needs are worth the hassle.\n\nOnce you have such a job, be sure to follow these rules:\n\n* I usually explain upfront, right in the interview, that ***I am never working for free***. I clock every hour I work for the company, and certainly clock overtimes I put in, and I expect to take leave the same amount of hours for compensation. (I have, twice over more than a decade, accepted money instead. But that was me accepting it, rather than them pressing me to do it.)\n* ***Do not let them press you*** into doing more hours without compensation. You might have relinquished other benefits (like money) for doing 30hrs/week. There is no point in relinquishing what you got for that. (The others wouldn't give up that money even if pressed hard, right?)\n* Remind everyone that you only have 75% of the time others have. Make sure that your team leader, when ***planning resources***, remembers that. If they have never worked with such an employee, then this will need constant reminding in the beginning.\n* We all know that in this industry crunch time is a common phenomena. When others work overtime, you might have to do that, too. However, be sure to make it absolutely clear that ***for you, 40hrs/week already is overtime***."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A senior software developer at a large tech company is seeking a more balanced work-life arrangement without completely sacrificing career growth.

Option C is the most appropriate strategy because:\n\n1. It directly addresses the desire for reduced hours (30-35 hours/week) mentioned in the original post.\n2. The documentation emphasizes that part-time positions in the tech industry often need to be \"carved out\" of the common job market, which aligns with seeking a new position rather than negotiating with the current employer.\n3. The answer incorporates the advice to \"be good at what you do\" by emphasizing productivity, which can help justify the non-standard arrangement.\n4. It allows for maintaining some benefits of working for a larger company, which the developer values.\n5. By changing employers, it avoids the problem mentioned that the current employer doesn't generally offer part-time employment.\n\nOption A is less ideal because the current employer doesn't offer part-time work, and a 4-day week might not provide enough flexibility.\n\nOption B (freelancing) is explicitly mentioned as less desirable due to the lack of benefits and stability.\n\nOption D (academia) is mentioned as having a \"gigantic drop\" in pay, which the developer wants to avoid if possible.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex career situation, consider multiple factors (work hours, pay, benefits, flexibility), and apply the advice given in the documentation to a real-world scenario."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/07", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/134747", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/57984/"], "docs_id": 134747, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's imagine I wrote a report a day ago and now I'm informing my partners about this.

In English, we often modify the sentence to match a particular *perspective*, in this case the perspective of Elena, from the future, looking back over something I did in the past. This in comparison to:\n\n> Elena will correct me if I **miss** something important.\n\nThis perspective is of me, looking forward to something I will do, which Elena will later correct.\n\nThis can be tricky and can be ambiguous without good time markers. Although you provide this information in your question, in your actual *example* it's not clear if you will miss something in the future (from when you are speaking) or you've already *missed* something in the past. In casual conversation, this information might not be important or you might have already provided context in the previous sentence, so it's not a big deal. Just something to think about.\n\nConsider these two examples:\n\n> Elena said she will correct me if I **miss** something important.  \n> \n>  Elena said she will correct me if I **missed** something important.\n\nBecause I'm indirectly quoting Elena, it's more apparent that, if I say \"miss\". it means I will do the task in the future, and \"missed\" means I've already done the task.\n\nOf course, this assumes that everyone chooses their words carefully instead of talking as they are thinking.

Option B correctly uses \"will provide\" to indicate a future action (Sarah's feedback) contingent on a past action (\"overlooked\" and \"sent\"), demonstrating the concept explained in the documentation where future actions can reference past events.\n\nOption A incorrectly combines future (\"will review\") with a completed past action (\"submitted it yesterday\"), creating a logical inconsistency. Option C misuses the present continuous (\"is approving\") for a future event and incorrectly sequences the tenses. Option D incorrectly uses \"will find\" in a time clause where simple present is required.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates the ability to use tenses to shift perspective, as explained in the documentation.

This approach addresses several key issues:\n\n1. It eliminates the separate subnet (192.168.2.*) created by device [3], integrating all devices into the 192.168.0.* network.\n2. It maintains the wireless connectivity for devices that can't connect directly to the main WiFi, preserving the client's requirement for device [3].\n3. It avoids the complexity of setting up and maintaining static routes or NAT rules, which can be error-prone and difficult to manage in a home network.\n4. It creates a flat network topology, allowing all devices to communicate directly without the need for inter-subnet routing.\n\nOption A (NAT) would add unnecessary complexity and potential performance issues. Option B (VPN) is overkill for a home network and adds significant complexity.

The correct answer is C because it presents the most problematic scenario for fitting the trim kit.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. Option A describes a cabinet opening that exactly matches the specified dimensions (Side E: 25-1/2\", Side F: 17-3/8\", Side G: 21\" minimum). This would provide a proper fit.\n\n2. Option B describes a cabinet opening that is slightly larger than the specified dimensions in all aspects. This would likely still accommodate the trim kit, as it provides extra space.\n\n3. Option C describes a cabinet opening that matches the width (25-1/2\") but is significantly shorter in height (15-5/16\") than the specified Side F (17-3/8\"). This discrepancy of about 2 inches in height would cause the trim kit to not fit properly.\n\n4. Option D describes an opening that matches the outer dimensions of the trim kit (Side A: 18-9/16\", Side B: 27\"). This would actually be ideal for a flush installation of the trim kit.\n\nThe question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (various dimensions and their relationships) and apply them to a practical scenario (cabinet design).

An alternative viewpoint is to partition $S^2$ by these planes moved to the center of that sphere. Within each cell of this arrangement of great circles on $S^2$, the area of the projection changes in a regular, computable manner (as a function of coordinates on $S^2$). None of this would be easy to implement, but it is computable in roughly $O(n^2\\)$ time for a 3\\-polytope of $n$ vertices. (Note here I am using $n$ for the number of vertices, and assuming you are working in $R^3$, whereas in Robby McKilliam's posting, $n$ is the dimension).\n\nFor this arrangements viewpoint, see the paper by Michael McKenna and Raimund Seidel,\n\"Finding the optimal shadows of a convex polytope,\"\n[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\\=323237](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=323237) ."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is developing a computational method to analyze the projections of a complex 3D polytope.

This method, as described in the top answer, provides a deterministic and comprehensive solution to the problem. \n\nThe arrangement of planes partitions the space of possible viewpoints into cells, where the combinatorial structure of the projection remains constant within each cell. By mapping this arrangement onto a sphere (S^2), we create cells bounded by great circles.

This is superior to statistical sampling methods (option A), which may miss critical projections and provide less precise results. It's also more reliable and theoretically grounded than a machine learning approach (option C), which would require extensive training data and may not generalize well to arbitrary polytopes.

The key misconception addressed is that the MTK6572 processor is x86-based, which is incorrect. The MTK6572 is actually an ARM-based processor (specifically, ARM Cortex A7). \n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that Ubuntu needs to be compatible with the ARM architecture, not x86.

However, if you start at a certain value of comoving coordinates (say on $S^3$), it turns out that there is no time\\-like or null geodesic that returns to your starting point. The easiest way to see this is through a Penrose diagram for de Sitter. \n\nThe Penrose diagram for de Sitter is shown below: (from [Les Houches 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110007))\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpYGj.png)\n\nPenrose diagrams encode the causal structure of spacetime. Every point in de Sitter corresponds to a point in the above square, and diagonal lines at $45^\\\\circ$ angles correspond to the world\\-lines of null geodesics or light rays. Two light rays are shown above, going from the line $I^\\-$ to $I^\\+$. The 'North Pole' and 'South Pole' are antipodal points on $S^3$, while $I^\\+$ and $I^\\-$ correspond to points at the infinite future and infinite past (if you want, you can think of these as equivalence classes of time\\-like geodesics). Hence, a ray of light has 'just enough time' in the lifetime of a de Sitter universe to travel from $\\\\theta\\=0$ to $\\\\theta\\=\\\\pi$, and can't get back to its original comoving position at $\\\\theta\\=0$.

The key insights are:\n\n1. De Sitter space has constant positive curvature, which might initially suggest the possibility of closed orbits.\n2. However, the Penrose diagram shows that light rays (null geodesics) travel at 45-degree angles from I- to I+.\n3. These light rays have \"just enough time\" in the lifetime of a de Sitter universe to travel from \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=\u03c0 (antipodal points).\n4. They cannot return to their original comoving position.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the photons would reach antipodal points, they wouldn't collide there as they're moving in opposite directions.\n\nOption B is a common misconception based on intuition from flat or negatively curved spaces, but it's not possible in de Sitter space.\n\nOption D represents a misunderstanding of the geometry, as there is no \"center\" of the 3-sphere in this context, and the curvature doesn't cause spiraling.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the true behavior in de Sitter space.

This outcome is counterintuitive but follows directly from the causal structure of de Sitter space as shown in the Penrose diagram.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to apply the concepts of de Sitter space geometry, causal structure, and light propagation to a hypothetical experiment, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/03/30", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/586818", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/449931/"], "docs_id": 586818, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019ve been trying to find this word for a long time.

The default value of 30 for initscalar seems to be far off from the correct value for the given dataset, causing the optimization algorithm to move in the wrong direction and minimize the likelihood instead of maximizing it.\n\nOption B is correct because adjusting the initscalar parameter to a value closer to 1, as demonstrated in the top answer, resolves the issue. This change allows the optimization algorithm to start from a more appropriate initial point, leading to the expected behavior of increasing log-likelihood values with each iteration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reducing the dataset size doesn't address the core issue of incorrect initialization and may lead to less accurate results.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increasing the epsilon value would only cause the algorithm to terminate earlier, potentially before finding the optimal solution, and doesn't address the underlying initialization problem.\n\nOption D is incorrect because implementing a custom optimization algorithm is an unnecessarily complex solution when the issue can be resolved by simply adjusting an existing parameter.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, parameter initialization, optimization algorithms) and tests the ability to apply this knowledge to a real-world data science scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and application."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/02", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/352584", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/197989/"], "docs_id": 352584, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Server has been running for over 1\\.5 years, with no problem.\nLast week started receiving errors and workstations freeze:\nlockd: cannot monitor \nstatd: server rpc.statd not responding, timed out\n\nServer:\nOS: Ubuntu 10\\.04\\.4\nKernel: Linux 2\\.6\\.32\\-51\\-server\nnfs\\-common 1:1\\.2\\.0\\-4ubuntu4\\.2\nnfs\\-kernel\\-server 1:1\\.2\\.0\\-4ubuntu4\\.2 \n/home x.x.x.0/255\\.255\\.0\\.0(rw,no\\_root\\_squash,insecure,async,wdelay,no\\_subtree\\_check)\n/public x.x.x.0/255\\.255\\.0\\.0(rw,no\\_root\\_squash,insecure,async,wdelay,no\\_subtree\\_check)\n\nWorkstations:\nUbuntu 10\\.04\\.x\nserver:/home /home nfs defaults 0 0\nserver:/public /mnt/public nfs defaults 0 0\n\nRan rpcinfo \\-p both from workstations and from servers both return ok.\n\nWhile lockd frozen, server is 100% accessible i.e ssh top df all return as expected.\nHowever the workstations are unable to move between desktops and become unresponsive, chrome stops functioning\n\nOn server ps \\-aux \\| grep lockd shows that the lockd process is D.\nHowever after a couple of min lockd returns to S and R, and workstations are functional again\n\nAfter enabling nlm\\_debug I see that indeed the lockd process gets stuck \n\nI notice in the below log that the lockd gets stuck for a minute 02:03:21 \\-\\- 02:04:21\n\nThis repeats when the lockd gets stuck and I found that by rebooting the \"offending\" workstation\nthe all systems return to function normally. \n\n```\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312596] lockd: request from 172.x.x.x, port=960\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312603] lockd: LOCK          called\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418685] lockd: nlmsvc_lookup_host(host='roi-lnx', vers=4, proto=tcp)\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418687] lockd: get host roi-lnx\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418688] lockd: nlm_lookup_host found host roi-lnx (172.16.16.76)\nOct  2 02:03:21 fs1 kernel: [646941.418689] lockd: nsm_monitor(roi-lnx)\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312552] statd: server rpc.statd not responding, \ntimed out\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312565] lockd: NSM upcall RPC failed, status=-5\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312570] lockd: cannot monitor roi-lnx\nOct  2 02:04:21 fs1 kernel: [647001.312572] lockd: release host roi-lnx\n\n```\n\nThis looks like a bug in lockd.\n\nI have spent days looking though Google, and there are a couple of similar cases but no fixes.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions to resolve this issue.\n\nThanks\nLaurence\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a similar environment with 10\\.04\\.4 ubuntu nfs\\-server serving approx. 50 ubuntu/mac os x clients (mostly 12\\.04\\.3\\), I had the same problem.

This conclusion is supported by several key pieces of information from the documentation:\n\n1. The issue started recently after 1.5 years of stability, suggesting a change in the environment rather than a server configuration problem.\n\n2. The admin noticed that rebooting the \"offending\" workstation caused all systems to return to normal functioning, indicating a client-side issue.\n\n3.

The top answer mentions a similar issue resolved by removing two new clients with a specific kernel version.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reconfiguring NFS shares is unlikely to resolve an issue that appeared suddenly after long-term stability.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The sentence uses \"might have\" + past participle, which is the correct structure for expressing a past possibility, as mentioned in the documentation: \"In order to use the word \"might\" in the past-tense you use the phrase \"might have\".\"\n\n2.

Given a finite k-morphism f: P\u00b9\u2096 \u2192 P\u00b9\u2096 of degree n \u2265 2, which of the following statements about f\u208aO(m) is most accurate?\n\nA) f\u208aO(m) always splits as a direct sum of n line bundles of equal degree\nB) f\u208aO(m) \u2245 O \u2295 O(-1)^(n-1) for all values of m\nC) The multiplicities \u03b1(m,k) in the decomposition of f\u208aO(m) depend only on n and the difference m-nk\nD) f\u208aO(m) has rank n but its decomposition into line bundles may involve more than n summands\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The key insights are:\n\n1) The pushforward f\u208aO(m) decomposes as a direct sum of line bundles on P\u00b9\u2096.\n2) The multiplicities \u03b1(m,k) in this decomposition satisfy \u03b1(m,k) = \u03b1(m-nk, 0), where n is the degree of the morphism.\n3) The formula for \u03b1(m,k) is given as the coefficient of x^(m-nk) in (1+x+...+x^(n-1))\u00b2.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the decomposition is not always into equal degree line bundles. The formula shows it can involve different degrees.\n\nOption B is only true for m=0, as explicitly stated for f\u208aO, but not for general m.\n\nOption C is correct. The formula \u03b1(m,k) = \u03b1(m-nk, 0) shows that the multiplicities depend only on n and the difference m-nk.\n\nOption D is partially true (f\u208aO(m) does have rank n), but it's not the most accurate statement. While the decomposition may involve more than n summands, this isn't the key insight from the derivation.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of sheaf pushforwards, their decomposition on P\u00b9\u2096, and the subtle dependence of this decomposition on the degree of the morphism and the twist of the original line bundle."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/06", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/337773", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/77262/"], "docs_id": 337773, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know that `\\tkzDrawLine(A,B)` `tkz-euclide` draws a line between points `A` and `B`.

The correct answer, C, uses the homothety transformation to extend the line beyond point B, creating a point C that is twice as far from A as B is. This effectively creates a ray starting at A and passing through B, extending beyond it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \\tkzDrawLine draws a full line, not a ray, and the add parameter doesn't create the desired effect.\nOption B is incorrect because \\tkzDrawSegment with extended=true is not a valid tkz-euclide command.\nOption D is incorrect because \\tkzDrawVector would draw an arrow, which is not an accurate representation of a ray in this context.\n\nThe correct solution demonstrates understanding of tkz-euclide's capabilities, the concept of homothety, and the practical application of these in representing real-world scenarios like security camera fields of view.

If you want to grep dmesg for your message once a minute, then just add a cron job that runs once a minute and greps dmesg for your message.\n\n```\n* * * * * if dmesg | tail -100 | grep -qs \"r8152.*Tx status -71\"; then /etc/kick-realtek.sh; fi\n\n```\n\n(The five asterisks are part of the crontab format and indicate the schedule time \\& date.)\n\nOne problem with that simple approach is it'll react to *all* such messages, even old ones logged before the last reset. You could avoid this by writing a marker line to dmesg (or even using an existing kernel message like \"USB device detected\" as the marker):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif dmesg | tail -100 | awk '/r8152.*Tx status -71/ {x=1} /KICKED/ {x=0} END {exit(!x)}'; then\n    /etc/kick-realtek.sh;\n    echo \"KICKED\" > /dev/kmsg;\nfi\n\n```\n\nAlternatively you could read and remember the last timestamp of such an error message, but that's much too complex in comparison.\n\n### Live monitoring\n\nAn even better option would be to use a program that continuously receives the log messages instead of having to do periodic checks. For example:\n\n```\ndmesg --follow | ...\n\njournalctl --dmesg --lines=10000 --follow | ...\n\ntail -n 10000 -f /var/log/kern.log | ...\n\n```\n\nRegardless of which one is used, pipe its output into a loop that checks each incoming line. Run the resulting script in background, ideally you could even turn it into a system service (/etc/systemd/system/\\*.service):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n... | while read -r line; do\n    if [[ $line == *r8152*Tx\\ status\\ -71* ]]; then\n        /etc/kick-realtek.sh\n    fi\ndone\n\n```\n\n(You could use `if echo \"$line\" | grep -qs ...; then` or similar, it doesn't matter.)\n\nFinally, many server systems *already have* a program that continuously receives all log messages, such as *rsyslog* or *syslog\\-ng*. (These programs are how dmesg gets copied to /var/log in the first place.) They can often filter the log messages and run programs:\n\n* [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog\\-execute\\-script\\-on\\-matching\\-log\\-event](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog-execute-script-on-matching-log-event)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting a recurring issue with a USB network adapter (Realtek r8152) that frequently disconnects.

The correct answer, B, is the most effective approach for real-time monitoring and immediate response. \n\nImplementing a systemd service that continuously monitors journalctl output provides several advantages:\n\n1. Real-time monitoring: Unlike cron jobs (option A) that run periodically, this approach allows for immediate detection of issues.\n2. Efficiency: It doesn't require constant polling of the system (unlike option D), reducing unnecessary system load.\n3. Comprehensive: journalctl captures all system logs, including kernel messages, ensuring no relevant information is missed.\n4. Persistence: As a systemd service, it can be easily managed, automatically restarted if it fails, and run continuously.\n\nWhile option C (modifying rsyslog) could also provide real-time monitoring, it requires more complex configuration changes and may not be as flexible or easy to manage as a dedicated systemd service.\n\nOption A is less effective due to its periodic nature, potentially missing issues between checks.

I\u2019ve seen external GPUs that will support three displays but they sell for far more than 13 euro.\n\nWith Apple computers it is one display to one port.

The correct answer (C) is the most balanced approach that addresses both security and user experience:\n\n1. Using Apple's Data Protection API ensures that sensitive data is encrypted at rest, which is crucial for security.\n2. Carefully managing which files are included in backups allows the developer to exclude highly sensitive data that shouldn't be backed up to iCloud, while still allowing users to benefit from backups for less sensitive data.\n3.

You need to specify three points with `\\tizkmark` rather than two because TikZ has no way of knowing which of the groups of words being marked is longer. If the bottom group is longer as in the first example, only two marks would be needed, but this won't work in the second example where the top group is longer, so you need to mark both the beginning and end of the top group and just the end of the bottom group.\n\nA simple version\n----------------\n\nUsing the `tikzmark` package (see complicated version below) introduces some complexity into this solution that is really not necessary for this purpose (although can be useful in other contexts). Specifically, the solution above requires a unique set of labels for each box you use. This become annoying if you are using it a lot.\n\nBy using a simpler version of `tikzmark` that doesn't use the package, you can avoid this altogether and then have a command that simply is `\\boxit` for the default case, and you can use the same set of labels each time.\n\nIn this version, the labels use the following scheme, where `<start>` is the upper left corner mark. These *must* be numeric, and the default is to start at 1\\.\n\n```\n<start> <start+1> <start+2>\n\n```\n\nNow you can just use `\\tikzmark{1}`, `\\tikzmark{2}` ,`\\tikzmark{3}` for all boxes unless you have more than one box in a single example. In that case, increase the start numbers by 3\\.\n\nNow to box the nodes, you can use:\n\n```\n\\boxit % this assumes nodes start at 1\n\n```\n\nor to have more than one box in an example, use the starred version and give the starting node number as an argument.\n\n```\n\\boxit*{<start>} % gives an explicit start\n\n```\n\nHere's the complete example showing the two boxes in the same example, and then another box using the same `1`, `2`, `3` marks in the subsequent example.\n\nThis solution works with both the regular gloss syntax of ExPex as well as the `nlevel` syntax. For `nlevel` formatted examples you need to make sure that the `\\tikzmark` commands in the glosses are *inside* the `[ ... ]` not outside of them. For this syntax I also increased the `glspace` parameter of the glosses since the spacing seemed tighter with the `nlevel` syntax.\n\n```\n\\documentclass[10pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{expex}\n\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{fit}\n\n\\newcommand{\\tikzmark}[1]{\\tikz[remember picture,overlay] \\node (#1) {};}\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand{\\boxit}{\\@ifstar\\@boxit\\@@boxit}\n\\newcommand{\\@@boxit}{\\@boxit{1}}\n\\newcommand\\@boxit[1]{%\n\\tikz[overlay,remember picture]{\n\\def\\pointlist{}\n\\pgfmathsetmacro{\\endpoint}{#1+2}\n\\foreach \\x in {#1,...,\\endpoint}\n{\\xdef\\pointlist{\\pointlist(\\x)}}%\n\\node[draw,rectangle,yshift=3.5pt,thick,\n      fit=\\pointlist,\n      inner sep=1pt,text depth=\\baselineskip] {};\n}}\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla \\tikzmark{1}Si fuera\\tikzmark{2} m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{4}un jugador\\tikzmark{5} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3} more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{6} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player\u2019//\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\\boxit*{4}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla Si fuera m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{1}un jugador\\tikzmark{2} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{3} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player'\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\n% example with the nlevel sytax\n\n\\ex[glstyle=nlevel,glspace=.7em plus .4em minus .15em] \n\\begingl \\tikzmark{1}Si[If] fuera\\tikzmark{2}[be.3.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3}] m\\'as[more] alto[tall] ser\\'ia[be.3.sg.COND] un[a] jugador[player] de[of] baloncesto.[basketball] \n\\glft If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player// \n\\endgl \\xe\n\\boxit\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![output of code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)\n\nOriginal, more complicated version\n----------------------------------\n\nHere's the original version of the answer, which requires unique nodes for each mark, and requires you to give the `\\boxit` command an argument with the appropriate label.

For example, the resistor is often put AFTER the LED, or the diode is put the opposite way. **Why is the direction of flow often disregarded in electronics?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrons have a negative charge. Current is Coulombs per second. Coulombs are positive, so a coulomb moving one direction is actually caused by electrons moving the other direction in meta.\n\nWhen we discuss current we are discussing the flow of positive charge particles. If the flow of current is actually made up of negative particles flowing in the opposite direction it makes no difference, that is two negatives which cancel. It is just a case of math and sign convention.\n\nThe only time you pay attention to the actual carriers is in something like a semiconductor where you need to know what is happening as you travel from electron carriers in the conduction band \"holes\" in the carrier band. The holes are positive charge carriers, but that is because we are counting the absence of an electron, the actual current is still made up of many many electrons slowly drifting.\n\n**### Is current always electrons?**\n\nActually if you ever model electrical systems in the body you will find that you can accurately [model a neuron](http://www.bem.fi/book/10/10.htm) using a transistor network and such. Much of the current relates to ions like potassium. This means that you really do have motion of positive charge articles. It still is just drawn as a schematic because it does not matter what the charge carrier is as long as your schematic models the electrical properties well.\n\n**### Is the electron moving the power?**\nOften people think that your power you are sending is the electron. In reality you are sending electromagnetic signals. You can slow the speed of your signal(ie. the power) propagating down a long pair of wires(one the signal and one the signal return) by changing the dielectric between them. This means two unshielded copper wires just sitting in space will actually have their signal travel near the speed of light. Your coax cable will probably travel very close to two thirds the speed of light. The electrons drifting are a function of the electric field that is present. If you were to measure how fast the electrons are drifing you would find it on the order of a few meters per second."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about current flow in electronics, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An electrical engineer is designing a circuit for a biomedical device that will be used to measure neural signals.

The correct answer, C, acknowledges several key points:\n\n1. Conventional current flow (positive to negative) is typically used in circuit design, regardless of the actual charge carriers.

The escaping air isn't very cold, and the home feels more humid than usual. What is the most likely root cause of this issue, and what potential consequences could it have on the system's performance?\n\nA) Damaged evaporator coil causing refrigerant leakage and reduced cooling efficiency\nB) Faulty blower motor leading to improper air circulation and increased humidity\nC) Worn weather stripping or gaskets around condensate ports allowing air to bypass the cooling coils\nD) Clogged air filter restricting airflow and causing pressure buildup in the air handler\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause is most likely worn weather stripping or gaskets around the condensate ports (option C). This conclusion is supported by several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The air leakage is occurring specifically near the condensate drain plugs.\n2. The escaping air isn't very cold, indicating it's leaking before reaching the cooling coils.\n3. The top answer mentions that \"There's usually weather stripping or a rubber gasket around the condensate ports that prevent air escaping.\"\n\nThis issue can have several consequences on system performance:\n\n1. Reduced efficiency: Air bypassing the cooling coils means less air is being conditioned, reducing overall system efficiency.\n2. Increased humidity: As mentioned in the answer, this leakage can contribute to excess humidity in the home because less air is passing through the coils where moisture would typically be removed.\n3. Potential for further damage: Continuous air leakage could lead to additional wear on other components or create conditions for mold growth if humid air condenses on nearby surfaces.\n\nThe other options, while plausible HVAC issues, don't align as closely with the specific symptoms described. Option A (damaged evaporator coil) would likely result in poor cooling performance overall, not just air leakage. Option B (faulty blower motor) would more likely result in weak airflow throughout the system, not localized leakage. Option D (clogged air filter) typically causes reduced airflow and potential freezing of the evaporator coil, which isn't mentioned in the symptoms.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (air handler operation, the role of weather stripping, and the impact on humidity control) and applies them to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere recall."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/06", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/12058", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/2930/"], "docs_id": 12058, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Update 11/3/2012**: In spite of being informed by multiple sources (here on SE, a guy at the Genie Clip Canada office, someone at the SE physics site, and even my own personal test) that I *should* be safe with this 500\\-lb wall being supported by 25 drywall screws, I have found that I could not stop thinking about it. So... I tore the wall down and will be using proper wood screws to fasten the clips. It's all about peace of mind in the end. I have a company coming in a few weeks to mud the walls I put up so I can prime and paint and I don't want to keep worrying about whether or not that wall is going to come crashing down, be it on me or the people who buy my townhouse when I decide to move.\n\nMy advice: **Never use drywall screws to bear any load.** As others have already stated, they're not designed to bear load. For that type of application, use proper screws with adequate strength.\n\n**Original question below:**\n\nI originally asked this question back in February and want to reword it in hopes that I can get a more obective answer. Here are the screws in question:\n\n[http://www.lowes.com/pd\\_112628\\-10681\\-S05CDW212\\_0\\_\\_?productId\\=3198059](http://www.lowes.com/pd_112628-10681-S05CDW212_0__?productId=3198059)\n\nLate last year, I hung two layers of type\\-X drywall on a furring channel assembly for a soundproofing project. The entire assembly goes like this:\n\n* Mounted 5 rows of Genie Clips (RSIC) to studs using the above\\-linked 2 1/2\" drywall screws. There are 25 clips total in the whole assembly. The clips are 1\" thick, so 1\" of the screw is outside the stud. However, it's fastened snug against the clip, so it's not like there's exposed screw sticking out of anything.\n* 5 rows of metal furring channels (hat channels) are snapped into the clips from the top of the wall to the bottom.\n* Two layers of type\\-X drywall at 72 lbs per 4x8 sheet are fastened to the furring channels using the same screws. There are 7 sheets, so 7x72 \\= 504 lbs. This wall is suspended, so it's not touching the ceiling, walls, or floor.\n\nThe instructions said I could use drywall or wood screws so long as they're coarse thread. Only after I got the wall installed did I learn of \"shear strength\" and that drywall screws are very brittle, snapping under pressure rather than bending like wood screws. This got me worried, so I came here to see if this wall is safe.\n\nIf the math is simple, we can take the total weight of the assembly (520 lbs if you add the approximate weight of the furring channels) and divide that by 25 (the number of clips) and arrive 20\\.8 lbs, the minimum average weight capcity per screw in order for the wall to hold up without anything being attached to it (dart boards, mirrors, portraits, etc).\n\nBut I am sure there are other factors here. For example:\n\n* If a screw has a shear strength of 20 lbs, do 25 of those screws together in an assembly average out at 20 lbs each or is there some kind of cumulative increase that would allow each screw to support more weight the more screws of its kind exist in the same assembly?\n* What is shear strength vs. shock strength? I saw a video of a guy taking a hammer sideways against a drywall screw and snapping it off, but that seemed a little unfair since an assembly stays still. You don't have strong and sudden downward forces occuring within your wall, so was that video a valid demonstration of a drywall screw's brittleness?\n\nI am obviously asking all this because I don't want the wall to come crashing down one day. If I have to tear it down and remount the clips using wood screws, I will have to do just that. However, if someone can provide a convincing argument that having all this weight supported by 25 drywall screws is okay (it's not framing or anything) then I will be able to sleep better at night.\n\n**Update:**\n\nSo I decided to do the test I talked about in my original question prior to rewriting it. What you see in these pics is a mock Genie Clip assembly. It's a spare 2x4 screwed into a wall stud with 3 screws. A Genie Clip is fastened to the spare stud with one of the screws linked above. This pic shows the assembly supporting 130 lbs of weight (total of 4 dumbells weight 50, 40, 25, and 15 lbs)!\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hhMO.jpg)\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3HJ7.jpg)\n\nSo if each drywall screw can support at least 130 lbs and I have 25 clip assemblies holding up this wall, I think it's safe to say that I could probably put at least 3,250 lbs on this wall. Since it weighs no more than 525 lbs as is, I think I am more than safe. Next time, though, I will use wood screws since that's the proper way to do it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's difficult to model the situation with rational analysis, there's too many intangible factors. You could do an empirical test. You need to support 20 lbs per fastener. We can apply a safety factor of 3 for ultimate strength, so the fastener should support 60 lbs without actually breaking. So you would need 2\\-4 fasteners to support your weight. Round down to the closest whole number. Install the clips as you did in the wall, except now install a metal strap between the screw head and clip. Arrange the straps so you can step into them to weight the system. Arrange the straps such that your weight is distributed evenly to each fastener.\n\nWeight the system and see if they break. If you live in a seismic area, bounce on them a bit and see if they break. You'll either be able to sleep better or you'll know what to do next, depending on the outcome. Obviously there are better ways to set up an empirical test, I chose to illustrate a quick and dirty method just as an example. Be sure you are protected from flying shards of metal.\n\nRegarding an increaser for the number of fasteners. No, you can't do that. It is a valid concept though, for example you can use a higher allowable bending stress in multiple floor joists than you can in a single use situation such as a header. The concept is not generally applied to fasteners.\n\n**Response to OP's Update**\n\nShear strength in relation to fasteners partly depends on what the fastener is holding. In this case it's known as a metal side plate condition, meaning the expected failure mode will either be the top of the screw failing through the shank (shear) or the wood collapsing under the compression from the screw. It's rare in reality to have a perfect shear condition, there is usually some bending and tension components as well.\n\nA true shear condition would something like a metal strap screwed to the wood surface and all the force was parallel to the wood surface, exactly perpendicular to the screw shank. In your test, you mostly have the vertical shear component, but there is a tension component as the center of mass is away from the wall surface. We can safely ignore the tension component in calculating a working load since 80\\# in pure shear is more conservative than 80\\# shear and, oh... say 15\\# tension combined.\n\nA picture of the clip was helpful, I imagined a much worse condition. Either way, the ultimate strength will not be proportional to shear alone, there are other factors difficult to model, thus testing is the best approach. The failure mode you experienced is a bending failure, but your actual installation, while having a bending component, is in fact mostly a shear condition.\n\nThe duration of load is a factor. The usual allowable stresses specified in construction are for permanently applied loads. The allowable stresses can be increased for shorter durations, 15% for a few months, 25% for a few weeks, 33% for a few minutes. Meaning we should reduce the allowable load determined through short term tests accordingly. But we also don't know the ultimate load since you didn't achieve failure. Just as well, uncontrolled destructive testing can be a little too exciting. You also haven't run multiple tests (I assume) to confirm you are getting consistent results.\n\nLet's say you did run multiple tests and they all actually failed at 80\\#. When you apply the 3x safety factor, then adjust for duration of load, you end up with a working load of 20\\#, exactly what you need. Considering there was no failure experienced, and the installation does appear to be predominantly shear, I think your installation is safe. Barely.

The engineer is considering using either drywall screws or wood screws to mount the Genie Clips. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the best practice for this situation?\n\nA) Use drywall screws, as they have been proven to support up to 130 lbs each in a single-clip test\nB) Use wood screws, as they have better shear strength and are more suitable for load-bearing applications\nC) Use either drywall or wood screws, as long as they are coarse-threaded and at least 2.5 inches long\nD) Use drywall screws, but increase the number of Genie Clips to distribute the load more evenly\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states: \"Never use drywall screws to bear any load.\" This is based on the author's final conclusion after extensive research and testing.\n\n2. Wood screws are mentioned as the proper alternative for load-bearing applications. They have better shear strength and are less brittle than drywall screws.\n\n3. While the single-clip test showed a drywall screw supporting 130 lbs (option A), this doesn't account for long-term stress, varying load conditions, or safety factors. The author ultimately decided against using drywall screws despite this test.\n\n4. Option C is incorrect because although the instructions initially suggested either screw type, further investigation revealed the limitations of drywall screws.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect because increasing the number of clips doesn't address the fundamental issue of using inappropriate screws for load-bearing.\n\n6. The question involves a heavier wall (750 lbs vs. 520 lbs in the original), requiring critical thinking to apply the principles to a new scenario.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of proper construction techniques, material properties, and the importance of choosing appropriate fasteners for load-bearing applications, integrating multiple concepts from the documentation."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/10", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/558453", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/261801/"], "docs_id": 558453, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I think that it is impossible to have the permittivity in vacuum because of there is no matter.

By examining the different ways that reactances can be combined in each step, it is possible to show that the reactance of the full circuit has positive real part and a definite sign for its imaginary part (depending on what $i$ sign convention you're using).\n\nThe system can then be analyzed using a Laplace transform, which will show that all the non\\-DC components are exponential transients, and will give you the decay time of those exponentials as the $1/RC$ time of the global reactance."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An electrical engineering student is designing a circuit to demonstrate the behavior of capacitors in DC circuits.

For the sake of simplicity, lets assume uniform priors on the positive part of the real axis. So that have a hierarchical model as follows: $$y\\_{i}\\| \\\\lambda\\_{i}\\\\sim Poisson(\\\\lambda\\_{i})$$\n$$\\\\lambda\\_{i}\\|\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\sim Gamma(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)$$\n$$\\\\pi(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)\\\\propto1\\_{\\[0,\\+\\\\infty]}$$\n\nNow you have a two groups of parameters: {$\\\\lambda\\_{i}$}$\\_{i\\=1,N}$ and {$\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$}. You need to draw random samples of these two groups of parameters from your posterior distribution. Although the model itself is not very complicated, you might stuck with very slowly mixing chains for you parameters, especially if your $N$ is very large (say 1000\\). \nYou can choose as your proposal normal distribution (just remember to reject properly negative proposed values) for whole set of parameters, in which case you would need ($N\\+2$)\\-variate normal distribution as a proposal, or you could use N\\-variate normal distirbution for lambda's and bivariate normal distribution for $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$.  \n I would suggest first of all to go with separately proposing lambda's and gamma parameters \\- i.e. to use Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. This would allow you to slightly decouple thouse chains. In this investigatory step I would use covariance matrix with no autocorrelations (i.e. diagonal matrix) for $N$\\-variate normal distribution.   \n\nIf that does not work, I would introduce for proposal distribution covariance matrix where correlations are not equal to zero \\- this should improve the mixing.\nAnd if this does not produce well\\-mixing chains, I would turn to the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. But first of all try to play with different matrices of multivariate normal proposal.\nI would also suggest to modify your model: instead of Poisson intensity $\\\\lambda\\_{i}$ to use $exp(\\\\lambda\\_{i})$ and then to use normal distribution for $\\\\lambda\\_{i}$ with unknown mean and variance parameters."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about generating correlated data and hierarchical modeling, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a hierarchical Bayesian model for analyzing count data from multiple sites.

I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about IIS features for .NET architects. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A large e-commerce company is experiencing performance issues with their ASP.NET application during peak traffic hours. The development team has implemented session state management and the operations team has set up multiple servers behind a load balancer. Despite these measures, users are reporting slow page loads and occasional timeouts. As the .NET architect, which combination of IIS features and strategies would you recommend to most effectively address these issues?\n\nA) Implement HTTP compression, use web gardens, and move static content to secondary servers\nB) Enable URL rewriting, increase the number of application pools, and implement browser-specific cookie handling\nC) Configure load balancing with sticky sessions, implement HTTP compression, and use application pools with web gardens\nD) Increase session timeout, implement form-based authentication, and use a content delivery network (CDN) for static assets\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple IIS features and their application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, combines several key concepts from the documentation:\n\n1. Load balancing: This is crucial for distributing traffic across multiple servers, which is necessary during peak hours.\n2. Sticky sessions: This ensures that a user's requests are consistently routed to the same server, maintaining session state integrity in a load-balanced environment.\n3. HTTP compression: As mentioned in the documentation, this \"significantly improves bandwidth utilization and application performs much faster.\"\n4. Application pools: These provide isolation between applications, improving stability and resource management.\n5. Web gardens: This allows multiple worker processes within an application pool, further improving concurrency and resource utilization.\n\nOption A is partially correct but misses the critical load balancing aspect. Option B focuses on less relevant features for the given scenario. Option D includes some good practices (CDN for static assets) but doesn't address the core performance issues as effectively as option C.\n\nThis question tests the architect's ability to integrate multiple IIS features, apply them to a real-world scenario, and prioritize the most effective solutions for the given problem. It goes beyond simple memorization, requiring analysis and application of the concepts presented in the documentation."}, "61": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/31", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/404340", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/202492/"], "docs_id": 404340, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am designing a simple, hobbyist single board computer similar to an Arduino using a Z80 CPU. The trouble I am running into is how the CPU addresses memory. I know that the Z80 uses pins A0\\-A15 to form an address bus, but reading \"The Z80 Microcomputer Handbook\", <https://archive.org/details/The_Z80_microcomputer_handbook_William_Barden/page/n109>, page 118 (In the book, not in the slider at the bottom of the webpage), second paragraph under \"Interfacing ROM and RAM\", it says that pin A15 is used to differentiate between the CPU addressing ROM or RAM. It says that when A15 is low, then ROM is being addressed, and when A15 is high, then RAM is being addressed. Is this true? \n\nIf it is, would I be correct in saying that that would take my 16 bit address bus to a 15 bit one, since one of those address pins is used to tell if the CPU is using ROM or RAM? Wouldn't it make more sense to AND MREQ and M1 together and connect that with the chip enable on the ROM, so as to make the ROM active whenever the Z80 is in opcode fetch mode?\n\nThe reason I ask this is because I would like the CPU to have 64K of ROM and RAM, if this is possible.\n\nI'm new here, so any help is much appreciated, but if I did anything wrong, please tell me and I'll fix it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Look at the schematic on the following page. A15 is connected to the chip selects of the ROM and RAM to make that happen. It's not a function of the Z\\-80 per se \\-\\- it's a function of how the external memory is laid out.\n\nGood choice \\-\\- the Z80 was the second microprocessor I ever worked with (in a TRS\\-80\\), and the first one I was paid to develop software on (at 13 \\-\\- you gotta love family businesses)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the Z80 CPU and memory addressing, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a single-board computer using a Z80 CPU and wants to maximize the available memory. Given the information about memory addressing and the A15 pin, which approach would most effectively allow the engineer to utilize the full 64K address space for both ROM and RAM?\n\nA) Use A15 as described in the book, dedicating 32K for ROM (A15 low) and 32K for RAM (A15 high)\nB) Implement bank switching using additional hardware to swap between multiple 64K memory banks\nC) Use a combination of MREQ and M1 signals to enable ROM during opcode fetches, leaving A15 available for addressing\nD) Modify the Z80 CPU internally to repurpose A15 for full address space utilization\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Z80's memory addressing concepts. The correct answer, C, offers the most effective solution to maximize memory usage without compromising the CPU's capabilities:\n\nA) is incorrect because it limits the total addressable memory to 64K, split evenly between ROM and RAM, which doesn't meet the engineer's goal of having 64K each of ROM and RAM.\n\nB) is a valid technique for expanding memory beyond 64K, but it adds complexity and doesn't directly address the issue of utilizing the full 64K address space efficiently within a single bank.\n\nC) is the best solution because it uses the CPU's existing signals (MREQ and M1) to differentiate between ROM and RAM access without sacrificing an address line. By ANDing MREQ and M1, the ROM can be enabled only during opcode fetches, leaving A15 free for addressing. This allows for a full 64K address space for both ROM and RAM, meeting the engineer's requirements.\n\nD) is incorrect because modifying the CPU internally is impractical and goes beyond the scope of a hobbyist project. It also doesn't align with using off-the-shelf components.\n\nThis solution requires understanding the Z80's signaling, the concept of opcode fetches, and how to efficiently use the available pins and signals to maximize memory usage.

"answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A LaTeX user is struggling with a table that doesn't display long text correctly in certain cells. They've provided their current code and want to improve it. Which of the following modifications would most effectively solve the issue while maintaining the table's structure and purpose?\n\nA) Replace the tabular environment with tabularx for automatic column width adjustment\nB) Increase the \\mylength value to accommodate longer text in each column\nC) Use the \\stwol command for the problematic cell in row 11, column 2\nD) Remove the multicolumn commands and use a simple two-column table structure\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution is to use the \\stwol command for the problematic cell in row 11, column 2. This approach leverages the user's existing custom commands without requiring significant restructuring of the table. The \\stwol command is designed to span two columns with appropriate width and alignment, which is exactly what's needed for the long text in the specified cell.\n\nOption A (using tabularx) would require a more extensive rewrite of the table structure and might not preserve the careful width calculations already in place. Option B (increasing \\mylength) would affect all columns uniformly, potentially disrupting the layout elsewhere. Option D (removing multicolumn commands) would simplify the structure but lose the carefully crafted layout and flexibility of the original design.\n\nThe correct solution (C) maintains the table's existing structure while solving the specific problem of displaying long text in the designated cell. This approach demonstrates an understanding of how to apply the user's custom LaTeX commands effectively, requiring minimal changes to achieve the desired result."}, "64": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/28", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/356130", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/126514/"], "docs_id": 356130, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my question [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/356120/redefine-macro-without-using-tmp-variable) how to properly add to a macro without storing the original one in a tmp variable, I was told that my code is actually working.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. It solves the original problem of modifying the macro without explicitly using a temporary variable.\n2.

Which of the following approaches would be most effective in achieving this goal while maintaining flexibility and minimizing code duplication?\n\nA) Modify the Lua function to include numbering directly in the sorted output\nB) Use a LaTeX counter and patch the \\item command within a local group\nC) Create a new index environment with built-in numbering functionality\nD) Redefine the \\index command globally to include automatic numbering\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is to use a LaTeX counter and patch the \\item command within a local group (option B). This solution offers several advantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: By using a counter (seqindexitem) and patching the \\item command locally, the numbering can be easily customized or disabled without affecting other parts of the document.\n\n2. Separation of concerns: The Lua function remains focused on sorting, while the LaTeX code handles the numbering, maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities.\n\n3. Localized changes: The patch is applied within a group, ensuring that changes to the \\item command don't affect other indexes or lists in the document.\n\n4. Compatibility: This approach works well with existing index packages and doesn't require modifying core LaTeX commands globally.\n\n5.

I am comfortable with these manipulations, and with the basic math of linear algebra in terms of understanding $\\\\Bbb{R}^3$ and $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ as abstract vector spaces over $\\\\Bbb{R}$ and $\\\\Bbb{C}$ respectively. Usually the manipulations in the complex domain are justified by appealing to the linearity of Maxwell's equations so that we can just \"keep track\" of the real part of the complex vector in question. This is where I don't quite follow. It seems that textbooks implicitly use some map (which I will refer to as $Re$) from $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ to $\\\\Bbb{R}^3$ in order to \"get back to the real field\" such that, for $(c\\_1,c\\_2,c\\_3\\) \\\\in \\\\Bbb{C}^3$,\n$$Re(c\\_1,c\\_2,c\\_3\\)\\=(Re(c\\_1\\),Re(c\\_2\\),Re(c\\_3\\))\\\\in \\\\Bbb{R}^3\\.$$ Is there any resource which you are aware of which is very careful about this correspondence, and which makes clear at every step of the way why a given operation on $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ does not break this correspondence effected by $Re$? I suppose that ultimately this question is about phasors more generally, but I was hoping for a resource specifically for electromagnetism since here we have complex vectors, as opposed to just complex numbers in, say, AC circuit theory.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose we have some equation involving complex variables, such as $a \\= b \\+ c$ or $a \\= bc$. You simply want to know when the equation remains true if we replace all the complex variables with their real parts. (Of course, here we are defining the real part of a complex vector to be a vector whose entries are the real parts of the entries of the complex vector, the real part of a complex vector field to be the real vector field whose value at each point is the real part of the complex vector field, and so on. In all cases we extend the definition of the phrase \"the real part\" naturally.)\n\nThe general rule is that it works whenever we only perform linear operations, which means multiplication by scalars and adding complex variables together, which follows from high school algebra. Thus, $a \\= b \\+ c$ implies $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(c)$, as well as $\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha c)$ for any complex number $\\\\alpha$, while $a \\= bc$ does not imply $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\\\, \\\\text{Re}(c)$ in general.\n\nIs it really so simple? Don't the textbooks do all kinds of operations, like time derivatives, divergences, curls, gradients, and Laplacians as well? If you recall the definition of a derivative,\n$$f'(x) \\= \\\\lim\\_{\\\\Delta x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x \\+ \\\\Delta x) \\- f(x)}{\\\\Delta x}$$\nyou'll see that a derivative is merely a particular example of subtracting two complex variables and then dividing by a scalar. That's true for all kinds of derivatives, so you're allowed to take any kind of derivative of both sides while preserving the desired property. There's really not much to it, which is why textbooks don't keep careful track of it.\n\nOf course, the fact that you can't multiply variables together means you need to be careful when dealing with quantities that are quadratic in the field, such as the power, energy, or momentum."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about electromagnetic wave propagation and complex analysis, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is analyzing a complex electromagnetic field described by the equation E = E\u2080e^(i(kz-\u03c9t)), where E\u2080 is a complex vector.

The correct answer is D because the correspondence between the complex representation and the physical field through the \"Re\" (real part) operation is preserved only for linear operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the physical field is related to the real part, it's not always exactly equal to it - this relationship holds only for linear operations.\n\nOption B is a common misconception. Multiplying by the complex conjugate gives the magnitude squared, not the physical field.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the magnitude of the complex representation relates to the amplitude of the wave, not the instantaneous field value.\n\nOption D is correct and captures the key point from the documentation. The real part operation preserves the correspondence for linear operations like addition, scalar multiplication, and derivatives (including time derivatives and spatial operations like divergence, curl, and gradient). This is why the complex representation is so useful in electromagnetics - it simplifies calculations while preserving the physical meaning for linear operations.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (complex analysis, electromagnetic theory, linear operations) and tests critical thinking about when and why the complex representation is valid, rather than mere memorization."}, "69": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/28", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/402908", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/121735/"], "docs_id": 402908, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been working with linux for a while but in a rather simple manner.\n\nI understand that scripts in `init.d` are executed when the os starts but how exactly does it works?\n\n**What if I want to keep a script but don't want it to start automaticly?**\n\nSay I have a `/etc/init.d/varnish` and want to disable it temporary.

Seriously, there isn't a single program in existence that can't be written completely DIP free.\n\nWe don't use DIP to accomplish a requirement. We use DIP so that the inevitable new requirement doesn't force a massive rewrite, recompilation, and redistribution. \n\nSo, do you need DIP here?\n\nWell there isn't much code here to go by, other than it's clear that `ShowUserInfo` knows about `User`. The question then is if we care.\n\nThink about this: `User` knows about `String`. `String` is as concrete as they come. Yet no one ever throws DIP at `String`. Why? Because `String` is stable (unlikely to change). Can you say the same thing about `User`?\n\nIf `User` is volatile (likely to change) then it's dangerous for `ShowUserInfo` to know about it directly. A change to `User` requires a change to `ShowUserInfo` if there is no DIP. A more stable interface or purely abstract class (doesn't matter which) helps protect against this volatility.\n\nNow that's just about needing a more stable abstraction. DIP can actually do a little more for you.\n\nDIP lets the flow of control go against the source code dependency. That gives you even more options to isolate against change.\n\nOf `User` and `DisplayUserInfo` which do you think is more stable?\n\nThe usual pattern is to assume the business rule classes are the most stable and the reporting / adapting classes that communicate with the outside world are less so. But, if for some reason you thought `User` was less stable you could use DIP to reverse the source code dependency so that `DisplayUserInfo` knows nothing about `User` and so is protected from its volatility. It's better to know about stable things than unstable things. What you don't know about can't hurt you.\n\nThat's the real nifty thing about those open arrows \\<\\|\\-\\- you see in UML diagrams. Flow of control goes through them backwards. That inversion of direction is where this principle gets its name. \n\nSince DIP lets you replace a uses arrow \\-\\-\\> with an implements arrow \\<\\|\\-\\- pointing the other way, you get to decide what knows about what regardless of what needs to talk to what. That's the real power of DIP."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software architect is reviewing a codebase and notices that the ShowUserInfo class directly depends on the concrete User class.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The primary purpose of DIP, as explained in the documentation, is to manage change and protect against volatility. While option A touches on this, it's not as strong a justification as C.\n\n2. Option C presents a scenario where polymorphism would be beneficial, which directly addresses the uncertainty expressed in the original question about whether to create an interface when polymorphism isn't currently needed.\n\n3. Supporting multiple user types in the future is a clear case where an abstraction (interface) would be valuable, allowing ShowUserInfo to depend on a stable interface rather than a concrete implementation.\n\n4.

This often means it would have been answered by even the shortest research on some documentation page, or from another SO question. Or, it's a really trivial development question (this is debatable, I know!, but that's not the point). Or, it does not belong to SO: it's superuser or serverfault \\-this happens extremely often.\n\nWhat I would really like is to never see those questions on SO. Get them downvoted so that they disappear. Because with the huge amount of Q\\&A on SO even a simple search (through google, through SO, even through the ninja search page) is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nWhat I'm tempted to do, sometimes, (SO forgive me!) is to answer, to get a little rep boost. And by the time I'm thinking about doing it, somebody does it.\n\nI do not want to say that I do know what bad Q is, but I'm wondering if something could be done to prevent this. \n\nMaybe an incentive to properly moderate and cleanup answers, through peer review, would counter this issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This comes across as a vague rant sprinkled with generalizations. Please, provide specifics. You generally say there are bad, unresearched questions that are being rewarded with reputation, and trivial answers to those questions are being similarly rewarded. Yet, there are no examples. I can counter and generally say that bad, unresearched questions are downvoted into oblivion and closed as fast as possible. \n\nYou say that there are questions on SO that should be on other Stack Exchange sites. I counter and say that those questions are usually identified, closed, or migrated. Again, generally, as fast as possible. \n\nHere's the truth:\n\nThere are algorithms in place to try to prevent the worst questions from being asked. Question length, poor structure, lack of code, etc. Any or all of these could be used to prevent a given question from being asked.\n\nThere are algorithms in place to identify the worst question *askers* and prevent them from adding a new question at all. Users that habitually ask the worst questions (poorly received, downvoted, closed, deleted) can have their rights to ask questions revoked. Again, this is to improve the overall quality of questions that make it to the site.\n\nPossible duplicates are presented to users *as they are typing*, to try to prevent unnecessary duplication and redundancy.\n\nUsers with sufficient reputation are another part of this process. We have the ability to see a question and decide if it passes the threshold of usefulness. If not, we can downvote it and/or vote to close for the appropriate reason (not a real question, too localized, etc.). \n\nFinally, users with lower reputation can still participate in this process by using moderator flags. If you see a question that you think is not a good fit, you're free to use flags to bring it to the attention of someone with sufficient rights to close it. This is particularly useful for slow moving tags (or slow moving SE sites). Faster tags (such as C\\#, Java, etc.) generally get enough eyeballs to make such flagging unnecessary, high rep users will sufficiently identify and act upon these questions.\n\nThere are a number of tools already at work.

The correct answer, C, addresses the root causes of the problem while balancing the need for quality control with user engagement:\n\n1. Enhancing the duplicate suggestion algorithm directly targets the issue of redundant questions, which the documentation mentions as an existing feature that could be improved.\n\n2.

They've come up with the following code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction validateCSS(property, value) {\n  var testElement = $('<div>').css(property, value);\n  return testElement.css(property) === value;\n}\n```\n\nWhat potential issue might this validation method encounter, and how could it be improved?\n\nA) It doesn't account for browser-specific prefixes, and should include checks for -webkit-, -moz-, and other vendor prefixes.\nB) It will incorrectly validate numeric values without units, and should add a unit check for properties that require them.\nC) It fails to detect valid properties that the browser normalizes, and should compare initial and post-application values instead.\nD) It creates unnecessary DOM elements, and should use a static list of valid CSS properties for validation instead.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The main issue with the given validation method is that it directly compares the applied value with the original value, which can lead to false negatives for valid CSS properties. Browsers often normalize or adjust valid CSS values, meaning the retrieved value might not match the input exactly, even if it's valid.\n\nThe improved method suggested in the top answer addresses this by comparing the initial value of the property to the value after applying the new CSS. If these values differ, it indicates that the browser successfully applied the property, thus validating it. This approach accounts for browser normalization and handles a wider range of valid CSS inputs.\n\nFor example, if you set `margin: 10px`, the browser might normalize it to `margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px`. The original method would incorrectly flag this as invalid, while the improved method would correctly identify it as valid.\n\nThis question requires the learner to analyze the given code, understand its limitations, and recognize the more robust solution provided in the documentation.

The rest of the house and the plugs in the room with the light still have electricity.\n\nI removed the entire light fitting from the ceiling. Then there where 2 wires poking through the ceiling. One wire is red, the other wire was black. (I assume red is live and black is neutral.) I cut off the black wire because some of the insulation had come off. (I cut off the black wire from the point where it branched from another black wire which goes to another light.) Now only the red wire is poking through the ceiling.\n\nThe entire ceiling (not the roof), is made of thin pressed metal plates (yes metal, not fibreglass). One side of the ceiling is painted (i.e. the side inside the house). The side of ceiling in the attic is not painted. At the spot on the ceiling where the light fitting was, some of the paint has come off. When touching the exposed end of the red wire to the unpainted ceiling, the circuit breaker trips.\n\nI assume somewhere in the attic a black wire (from another light fitting, or from the cables leading down to a plug) is touching the metal ceiling.\n\nThe attic is a mess. It is impossible to walk in the attic due to the struts, rafters, beams, braces (i.e. all the wood holding up the roof). I can only \"crab\\-along\" the horizontal beams that rest on the walls. Of course I cannot step onto the pressed ceiling; it is far too thin. Pink insulation wool is lying on the pressed ceiling. The black and red cables run above the insulation wool. The black and red cables run from the distribution box, in parallel, seperated by about 3cm, until they descend down into either a light fitting or down towards the plugs. I have also noticed what seems to be earth wires. These are uninsulated metal cables. These earth cables frequently run under the insulation wool. As far as I can tell, the earth wires touch the ceiling. \n\nTo narrow down the cause, I switched off all sub\\-circuits on the distribution board. Then, one\\-by\\-one I switched on each sub\\-circuit individually, and tried to cause the short circuit. Only 2 sub circuits cause the problem. These 2 circuits are for the plugs in various rooms in the house.\n\nQuestions\n\n1. How do I track this short circuit down ? My plan was to lift the insulation wool and to\n\t* check that all red and black cables are still insulated\n\t* check for any exposed red or black cable touching the ceiling or the earth cables.\n2. Is there any device that can help me track this problem down?\n3. For safety, before going up into the attic, I will switch off the electricity to the house (at the entrance to the property).

Given the complex attic layout and wiring described, what is the most likely cause of this issue and the best approach to diagnose it?\n\nA) Damaged insulation on a neutral wire touching the ceiling; use a non-contact voltage tester to trace the fault\nB) Earth wire improperly connected to the metal ceiling; perform continuity testing between the ceiling and earth terminal\nC) Live wire from another circuit contacting the metal ceiling; use a circuit tracer to identify the problematic circuit\nD) Faulty circuit breaker causing false trips; replace the breaker and retest the system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause is a live wire from another circuit contacting the metal ceiling, as evidenced by several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The problem persists even after removing the light fitting and cutting the neutral (black) wire, indicating the issue is not with that specific fixture.\n2. Only two sub-circuits for plugs in various rooms cause the problem when individually tested, suggesting the fault is in one of these circuits rather than the lighting circuit.\n3. The metal ceiling is acting as a conductor, allowing the short circuit to occur when the known live (red) wire touches it.\n4. The description of the attic wiring mentions cables running above insulation, which could have become damaged or dislodged over time.\n\nUsing a circuit tracer is the best approach because:\n1. It allows for non-invasive tracing of wires through walls and ceilings.\n2. It can help identify which specific circuit is causing the problem, narrowing down the search area in the complex attic space.\n3.

What evidence is there that \"How do you call ...\" is, or is not, a legitimate phrasal usage or expression in English?\n2. Could it be called a dialectal variant? Why is it considered non\\-standard?\n3. How do linguists define the \"How do you call ...\" vs. \"What do you call...\" debate? Has any interest been shown in this lexical divergence between Romance languages and English?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **We are confusing and conflating these forms here:** \n\n**1\\. How do you say ... (in X)?** This is asking for a word or phrase, perhaps specifying in language X.  \n\n**Example:** \\*How do you say *you're welcome* in Hebrew? How do you say *sandals* in Japanese?\\*  \n\n**2\\. What do you call \u2026 (in X)?** This is asking for a word or phrase for something you're pointing at or describing. It may expect an answer in English, or in another language.  \n\n**Example:** \\*What do you call a *helicopter* in Cantonese? What do you call the blue thing on top of that box? What do you call that color? What do you call that color in French?\\*  \n\n**3\\. How do you call \u2026 ?** This is asking for a procedure: how do you call a waitress, a cat, a taxi. The expected answer can't be *Toots, Felix, Yellow Cab.*  \n\n**4\\. What's ... name?** This is asking for a noun word or phrase in the same language.  \n\n**Examples:** *What's your name? What's the name of the movie you saw?*\n**5\\. How do you ...?** This question can take lots of different predicates, and the answers will all include verbs. \n\nAll these forms are good, grammatical, idiomatic English when used this way. Any other uses of these forms would be non\\-idiomatic, non\\-standard, and maybe incomprehensible. \n\nThe difficulty arises when foreigners use their own grammar and thought patterns, but with English words. *Lei come si chiama?* in Italian, literally means *how do you call yourself?* and does not expect the answer *\u201cI use a cellphone\u201d*. In idiomatic English this is *what's your name?* The Italian is wired to use this form for forms 2 and 4 above, never using the word \u201c*name*\u201d in questions like those. In fact, if an Italian pointed to something and asked another Italian what that thing's name is, he would be thought facetious, expecting an answer like \u201cIt reminds me of Sally, so let's just call it Sally for now.\u201d \n\nThis difficulty cuts both ways. If you ask a Spanish speaker for his name, using form 4 above, you would say \u201c*Cual es su nombre*\u201d. He would be within his rights to answer \u201c*My name is the unique label by which I am distinguished from others in the room*\u201d. You should ask *como se llama*, but you're not wired for that, it's not one of the forms on our list.\n\n**So now to answer the questions.** \n\n*What evidence is there that* \"How do you call...\" *is, or is not, a legitimate phrasal usage or expression in English?*\n*How do you call* is legitimate in English \u2013 see form 3 \u2013 but only in the use allowed in form 3\\. Otherwise you do two things: you risk not being understood within the flow of speech, and you cause a needless proliferation of forms when we have a good one present already. I know this is getting into the descriptive\\-prescriptive debate, which is a different can of worms, but we're there anyway just by discussing the question. Your Ngram is all the evidence needed for pointing out that this is ono\\-standard. As for *legitimate*, well, that's an opinion. \n\n*Could it be called a dialectal variant? Why is it considered non\\-standard?* \nThese are two questions. First, no, I know of no such dialectical variant. Second, I have already shown why it's non\\-standard above. And indeed your Ngram shows that it's non\\-standard. There's another thing about Ngrams: in a world in which educational standards are dropping, along with IQs *pace* the Flynn effect, more and more examples of poor English are going to show up. Just because a form is standard in language A doesn't mean that it should become standard in language B, and this becomes very obvious when A and B are from different families. \n\nYour final question pair:  \n\n*How (!) do linguists define the* \"How do you call...\" vs. \"What do you call...\" *debate? Has any interest been shown in this lexical divergence between Romance languages and English?*  \n\nThe ! is unnecessary \u2013 this is a perfectly valid use of form 5 above. AFAIK, This debate doesn't have a name of its own \u2013 it's not important enough to deserve one.  \n\nThe divergence between Romance and English here is not primarily lexical, but structural. As such, it's of prime importance in language learning \u2013 as you can see by the mistakes of those who haven't paid attention. Unfortunately, most language teaching starts with vocabulary to the exclusion of structure, so they teach the *como se llama usted : what's your name* equivalence almost as a single lexical chunk on each side of the colon, making comprehension and analysis of the structures very difficult for the learner. It would be far better if they used this as an early opportunity to teach that learning a foreign language is not just \u2013 indeed not even \u2013 a matter of word lists."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A non-native English speaker, fluent in Romance languages, consistently uses the phrase \"How do you call...\" instead of \"What do you call...\" when asking about object names.

Currently other than the occasional warning or suspension there is no real deterrent. The lack of any noticeable penalty, I suspect, fuels the willingness of these users to engage in the disruptive behavior that Mods are forced to deal with.\n\nIf a comment is removed for being rude or abusive, a penalty of 25 rep being applied would be a good reminder that this behavior is not acceptable, and provide a tangible penalty for misbehavior. In addition if these changes were visible to other users, they might choose not to engage in comment banter with someone who has a track record of disruptive comments. In the end both of these results are a win for both moderators and the community.\n\nThis would also have a positive effect for Hot Network Questions where users not normally engaged with the community, have the ability to comment snark and engage in disruptive comment behavior.

I really want to find a way to reduce the number of comments I have to deal with and **even considering that**, I'm hesitant to consider this a good solution.\n\nI'm concerned that there are too many avenues for abuse or accidental usage, particularly knowing how mod comment flag processing goes. It's really easy to see a comment, delete it, and only later (if ever) realize that it was flagged as rude or abusive rather than \"no longer needed\". \n\nWhen I review flags in a post rather on the flag page, I don't even look at which comments are flagged, I look at the entire comment chain and if I delete a comment, the flag is marked helpful even if the reason I deleted the comment was because I thought it was \"no longer needed\". If I want to specifically decline an abusive comment flag, I have to decline it before I delete the comment.\n\nComment flags should be quick and easy to handle, they should not cause the moderator be scared that they might accidentally cost a user 25 or 50 or 100 reputation because they validated a flag that was miscategorized.\n\nI think the only way this could work is if the comment is flagged as rude/abusive by a moderator and maybe additionally if sufficient users flag it as such. A moderator simply deleting the comment or clicking on \"helpful\" should not come with this penalty. If a moderator handles the flag, they should specifically choose to flag the comment if they believe it deserves the penalty.\n\nAutomatic single\\-flag deletion due to keywords probably should not carry this penalty, either, as there are many false\\-positives with this flag. A comment including the word \"sex\" isn't *necessarily* offensive, for example.\n\nThis would correlate with the [deletion of a post as rude or abusive](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035/284336) costing the user 100 reputation.\n\nI don't want to support this request, generally, but if I feel it necessary to at the very least improve it."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A StackExchange moderator is considering implementing a new system to deter rude or abusive comments.

It addresses the concern raised in the top answer about accidental penalties. The moderator states, \"Comment flags should be quick and easy to handle, they should not cause the moderator be scared that they might accidentally cost a user 25 or 50 or 100 reputation because they validated a flag that was miscategorized.\"\n\n2.

The error message suggests that the '.runtimeconfig.json' file is not being found, despite being included in the zip file. This scenario is typical when the zip file structure doesn't match what Elastic Beanstalk expects.\n\nOption D is correct because it addresses the root cause identified in the top answer: \"I was zipping up one level too high.\" By zipping only the contents of the folder containing the '.runtimeconfig.json' file (and not the folder itself), the file will be at the correct level in the deployment package for Elastic Beanstalk to find it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modifying the '.runtimeconfig.json' file won't address the structural issue of the deployment package.

Modify the function to use e.target.files && e.target.files[0] for safer access.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root issue is a combination of factors, making B the most comprehensive answer. The primary problem is that the console.log statement is placed outside the handleChange function, so it only runs once when the component renders, not when a file is selected. Additionally, there's a subtle error in the onChange event handler where (e) => handleChange should be (e) => handleChange(e).\n\nTo fully resolve the issue:\n1.

Some languages may have a single word to express the two actions together, but that is not the case in English.\n\nNote that two of the examples given by Cambridge are:\n\n> Camille snorts when she laughs.\n\nAs well as:\n\n> By this time I was snorting with laughter.\n\nIn general, I would say that people are more likely to exhale when snorting with laughter than to inhale, so this fits the first half of your action reasonably well.\n\nSimilarly, [this site](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/snort) seems to take it as given that it involves exhaling (though it need not, it at least indicates a tendency):\n\n> make a snorting sound by exhaling hard.\n\nHowever, note that \"snorting\" would rarely refer to exhaling with the mouth alone to express laughter.\n\nIf you want to refer to the exhalation and the smiling together, you would likely have to use two verbs: \"He snorted with amusement and smiled.\" It is perhaps also worth keeping in mind here that the actions used to express amusement are not entirely universal across cultures, so if (for instance) this is a situation where the character is exhaling rapidly through their *mouth* and then smiling, this would not be common in some English\\-speaking countries, which might be why English would lack a single word for it."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the word \"snort\" and its usage in describing reactions, here's a question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A novelist is describing a scene where a character reacts to a humorous situation.

Option B is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It accurately describes the two-part action mentioned in the original query (quick exhalation followed by a smile) without relying on a single word that doesn't exist in English for this combined action.\n\n2. It avoids using \"snort,\" which, while close to the desired meaning, has limitations. The documentation states that \"snorting\" rarely refers to exhaling with the mouth alone and is more commonly associated with the nose.\n\n3. It maintains cultural sensitivity by describing the action in a way that could be universally understood, addressing the point that \"actions used to express amusement are not entirely universal across cultures.\"\n\n4. It combines the concepts of exhaling and smiling without assuming a specific cultural context, making it suitable for a wider audience.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses \"snorted,\" which the documentation suggests might not accurately capture the intended reaction, especially if mouth exhalation is involved.

I'm not entirely sure if this question belongs to MathExchange either, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nIf you with to skip the preamble, fell free to go to the \"Main Problem\" section.\n\nThe original problem\n--------------------\n\n(a little background, for the ones not inclined to computer graphics: bump\\-maps are simply computer images in which each pixel stores a normalised three\\-dimensional vector, instead of three discrete color intensity values)\n\nI got an idea the other day, when trying to optimize bump/normal mapping on a very computing\\-power\\-restricted environment, to replace my RGB bump\\-map with an indexed image. This way, instead of calculating the lightning equation/dot product for each pixel on display, I would just need to calculate it for each normal stored on the image index, and replace the image index by the equivalent light intensity obtained for each normal when displaying the image. It has obvious shortcomings, such as the need for an infinitely distant (or parallel) light source (instead of point light sources), but for my purposes it works just fine.\n\nSo, in a new attempt to reduce even further the computing power required for the operation, and compress the map even further, I imagined what would be needed to generate an ideal index, given an space constraint (amount of stored normals). Turns out it's the very key idea about my question that will solve this as well.\n\nThe main problem\n================\n\nThe above problem can be solved for N indexes *if* there's a way to partition a spherical shell of unitary radius into N equal\\-area shell segments/cuts, much like an optimised Voronoi Diagram, albeit in spherical space. A turtle shell is probably the best real\\-world analog to this idea:\n\n![Voronoi Tortoise](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBVqm.jpg)\n\nMy question basically boils down to, *\"Is there a way to partition a spherical shell into N polygonal segments, akin to a Voronoi Diagram (where the edges of the polygons themselves are straight arcs on the shell surface and the regions themselves are as \"uniform\" and sparse as possible on the shell surface), where each of those segments occupy exactly the same shell area?\"*\n\nConsiderations\n--------------\n\n* I assume a solution to this problem would be dependent on some sort of constraint, like a set of initial vectors or orientations.

This will give you 20 identical \"equilateral\" spherical triangles that cover the sphere. If you need more triangles, subdivide these 20\\. Division into 3 is easy, so you can get partionings that consist of 20, 60, 180, 540 pieces, and so on.\n\nYou could do the same sort of thing starting with a tetrahedron, actually. This would give you partions with 4, 12, 36, 108 pieces, and so on.\n\nIn fact, I guess you could use any [Platonic solid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid) as a starting point.\n\nSubdividing triangles into 4 smaller ones (rather than 3\\) might be better, since the smaller triangles will then be more nearly equilateral."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about partitioning a spherical shell, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A computer graphics developer is optimizing a bump mapping algorithm for a resource-constrained environment.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. It starts with an icosahedron, which has 20 faces. This is mentioned in the documentation as a valid starting point.\n2. Projecting the edges onto the sphere creates 20 identical \"equilateral\" spherical triangles.\n3.

In other words, ideally it shouldn't happen very often. I guess it's preferable to release another \"official\" version, containing only major bug fixes if necessary, rather than performing fixes and immediately putting them back in the production branch (master).\n\nHowever, if you're following exactly this hotfix scenario, I think that you should indeed create one pull request targeting *master* (without closing your hotfix branch), and after this merge happens (with your team reviewing the PR, and on which most likely there won't be any conflicts since there aren't parallel people committing stuff to master branch), you create a second PR targeting *develop*, solving your conflicts on the hotfix branch, if necessary (this time, closing the source \"hotfix\" branch).\n\n> Boss level: a hotfix branch when a release branch is ongoing. Does this case need three PRs: to master, develop and the release branch?\n\nIn this scenario, **in my opinion** (based on the \"*Bugfixes may be continuously merged back into develop*\" part from the diagram), you should merge the hotfix to the *release* branch, because it will eventually be merged back into develop, and it already should contain only bugfixes (the hotfix is nothing but a fix performed on production)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A development team is using GitFlow and encounters a critical bug in production that requires immediate attention.

By first merging the hotfix into master (which typically shouldn't have conflicts), the critical fix is immediately applied to production. Creating separate pull requests for the release and develop branches allows for independent conflict resolution in the hotfix branch for each target. This method respects the GitFlow model's branching structure, where hotfixes can be applied to multiple branches as needed. It also aligns with the documentation's suggestion to create multiple PRs for \"multi-destination branches\" like hotfixes.

The daily cap remains in effect, preventing any further reputation gain from upvotes for that day.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bounty offerings don't allow bypassing the daily cap for new upvotes.\nOption C is incorrect because the reputation doesn't temporarily increase and then decrease; it simply doesn't increase at all.\nOption D is incorrect because while the bounty does reduce the user's total reputation by 100, the new upvote doesn't partially offset this; it has no effect due to the cap.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the reputation system's rules, application to a specific scenario, and understanding of the interaction between different reputation-affecting actions, making it a higher-level question on Bloom's taxonomy."}, "94": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/13", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/49226", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/972/"], "docs_id": 49226, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The spectrum of a graph is the (multi)set of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix (or Laplacian, depending on what you're interested in).

The key information is that there are specific classes of graphs for which isospectrality (having the same spectrum) implies isomorphism. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, \"two non-isomorphic graphs might have the same spectrum\" in general.

After describing the data, I hope some of you can tell me more about this.\n\nTwo groups of possible factors / variables influencing CSR have been identified: company\\-specific and country\\-specific.\n\nFirst, company\\-specific variables are\n\n* `MKT_AVG_LN`: the marketvalue of the company\n* `SIGN`: the number of CSR treaties the company has signed\n* `INCID`: the number of reported CSR incidents the company has been involved in\n\nSecond, each of the 4,000 companies in the dataset is headquartered in one of 35 countries. For each country, I have gathered some country\\-specific data, among others:\n\n* `LAW_FAM`: the legal family the countries' legal system stems from (either French, English, Scandinavian, or German)\n* `LAW_SR`: relative protection the countries' company law gives to shareholders (for instance, in case of company default)\n* `LAW_LE`: the relative effectiveness of the countries' legal system (higher value means more effective, thus for instance less corrupted)\n* `COM_CLA`: a measurement for the intensity of internal market competition\n* `GCI_505`: mesurement for the quality of primary education\n* `GCI_701`: measurement for the quality of secondary education\n* `HOF_PDI`: power distance (higher value means more hierarchical society)\n* `HOF_LTO`: country time orientation (higher means more long\\-term orientation)\n* `DEP_AVG`: the countries' GDP per capita\n* `CON_AVG`: the countries' average inflation over the 2008\\-2010 timeframe\n\nIn order to make an analysis on this data, I \"raised\" the country\\-level data to the company\\-level. For instance, if Belgium has a `COM_CLA` value of 23, then all Belgian companies in the dataset have their `COM_CLA` value set to 23\\. The variable `LAW_FAM` is split up into 4 dummy variables (`LAW_FRA`, `LAW_SCA`, `LAW_ENG`, `LAW_GER`), giving each company a 1 for one of these dummies.\n\nThis all results in a dataset like this:\n\n```\nCOMPANY MKT_AVG_LN ...

I believe to have found out that \"categorical\" variables are also known as fixed factors. Is all this true?\n* I believe an OLS regression analysis is not the proper model here because of the categorical (country\\-level) variables. It has been proposed to use \"Generalized Linear Models\" (GLS), using the country\\-level variables as (fixed?) \"factors\" and the company\\-level variables as \"covariates\". Is this correct? And as a subquestion: why exactly is OLS not appropriate because of the country\\-level variables? What is it what they do in the OLS calculations that makes them set off the regression?\n\n`[edit 1]` I am using SPSS for statistical analysis\n\n`[edit 2]` Here my attempt to create a GLM using this data. However, I am unable to not get the \"you haven't specified a custom model\" Do I have to select all 4 variables here (becaus I want a beta and significance level for all 4 of them to construct a regression model)? And if so, why do I have to do this twice? I already said in a previous dialogue box that `DEP_AVG` and `CON_AVG` are fixed factors and that `SIGN` and `INCID` are covariates. Why would I, for instance, insert `INCID` here as a covariate, but not include it in the model building dialogue? Also, I really don't understand the output I'm getting, since it is very different from ordinary OLS output (the only output I'm slightly comfortable with). \n\n* Am I now doing the right analysis?\n* How can I get a regression model from this?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ewFeo.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether a variable is categorical depends only on the variable, not on any \"sharing\" of common values. In your case, LAW\\_FAM is categorical because it has four discrete categories: FRA, SCA, ENG, GER. In particular, LAW\\_FAM is nominal: the categories have no ordering. You could have several countries which happen to have exactly the same DEP\\_AVG, but that doesn't make DEP\\_AVG a categorical variable.\n\nI would suggest that you look at [Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model), since you have hierarchical data: country\\-level data and company\\-level data nested within countries.\n\nYour post is very good: you include enough details to help us help you. One more thing that would also help us point you in the right direction is to know what software you will be using for your analysis.\n\nEDIT: You ask about Generalized Linear Models, which are chosen for specific kinds of dependent variables. For example, if you were wanting to predict a categorical variable, you'd use Logistic Regression (which is done with a GLM)."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing the corporate social responsibility (CSR) behavior of companies across multiple countries. Given the hierarchical nature of the data (companies nested within countries) and the mix of company-specific and country-level variables, which statistical approach would be most appropriate for this analysis?\n\nA) Simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression\nB) Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with fixed factors\nC) Multilevel/Hierarchical Linear Model\nD) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate statistical approach for this research scenario is a Multilevel/Hierarchical Linear Model. This choice is based on several key factors:\n\n1. Data structure: The dataset has a clear hierarchical structure with companies (level 1) nested within countries (level 2). This violates the assumption of independence in traditional OLS regression.\n\n2. Variable types: The study includes both company-specific variables (e.g., MKT_AVG_LN, SIGN, INCID) and country-level variables (e.g., LAW_FAM, LAW_SR, LAW_LE). Multilevel models can simultaneously analyze the effects of variables at different levels.\n\n3. Accounting for clustering: Companies within the same country are likely to share similarities due to common country-level factors. Multilevel models can account for this clustering effect, which simple OLS or GLM cannot adequately address.\n\n4. Variance partitioning: Multilevel models allow for the partitioning of variance between the company and country levels, providing insights into the relative importance of company-specific vs. country-level factors in influencing CSR behavior.\n\n5. Cross-level interactions: If the researcher wants to examine how country-level factors moderate the relationship between company-specific variables and CSR, multilevel models can accommodate these cross-level interactions.\n\nWhile GLM with fixed factors (option B) could potentially be used, it doesn't fully capture the nested structure of the data. OLS regression (option A) is inappropriate due to the violation of independence assumption. PCA (option D) is a dimension reduction technique and not suitable for this type of analysis.\n\nThe multilevel approach addresses the limitations of the other methods and provides a more nuanced and accurate analysis of the complex relationships in this dataset."}}
