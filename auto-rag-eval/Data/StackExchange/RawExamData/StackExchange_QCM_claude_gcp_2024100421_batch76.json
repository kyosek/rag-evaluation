But I haven't found any *authoritative* sources, like books, developer journal articles or msdn pages explaining why you shouldn't write code like the above. Are there any sources like that, if so, where?\n\n**Edit**: I'd say that \"famous\" bloggers also count as authoritative sources. My rule for what counts as authoritative or not is not exactly set in stone.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In C\\#, you couldn't ask for a more authoritative source than the [Framework Design Guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). This is what the authors of the .NET Base Class Library followed when designing the core libraries that come with .NET.

This practice, often referred to as the \"Pokemon Exception Handling\" anti-pattern (gotta catch 'em all!), is discouraged because it can mask important errors and make debugging more difficult.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it goes against the guideline by suggesting to catch all exceptions using System.Exception.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it implies always logging and continuing execution, which can lead to ignoring critical errors that should potentially stop program execution.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it explicitly mentions using the Pokemon Exception Handling anti-pattern, which is discouraged by the guidelines.\n\nOption C is the correct answer as it aligns with the Framework Design Guidelines' recommendation to avoid catching non-specific exceptions in application code."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/28", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/228350", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/1326/"], "docs_id": 228350, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm investigating what products are out there that will allow you to request images through a HTTP API in arbitrary image sizes.

It will allow you to resize the image. The only catch here is that you want to cache the image, Ideally.\n\nFor making the image cache friendly you would have to redirect to a unique URL and will have to keep the state of the for every call for redirection.\n\nexample.\n\n[http://example.com/resize/image.php?image\\=example.jpg\\&width\\=640\\&height\\=320](http://example.com/resize/image.php?image=example.jpg&width=640&height=320) which does resizing of example.jpg. For this to be cache able image.php sould return a url redirection.\n[http://example.com/resize/static/example640x320\\.jpg](http://example.com/resize/static/example640x320.jpg)\n\nFor the second URL ensure that you have the correct expiration headers set so that the CDN can cache it.

One should be able to interact with these items via a context menu. But: Which entries in the context menu are shown depend on the state of the item.\nFor example: I have a list box of data sources whose context menu shall show \"connect\" or \"disconnect\", depending on whether its already connected or not.\n\nThis is where I don't know how to correctly implement this with the MVP architecture.\n\n**How can I fill the context menu with state dependent items while the view does not know about the state and the presenter does not know about where to put a context menu?**\n\nMy thoughts so far:\n\nThe view receives the framework event for opening the context menu. Now it must populate the menu but has no info on the state of the underlying model.\nIt could just call a corresponding presenter method (the original framework event object would not be passed to the view, see assumptions). The presenter could query the model and get the state, but how does the info get to the view?\nIf the view had a method like \"show\\_context\\_menu\" then how would the view know where to put the context menu. This information would only be available in the method handing the original context menu event and I don't think something like coordinates should be passed to the presenter. Or should it?\n\nThis is a general question and not framework or language dependent.\n\nMy Assumptions (Which might be wrong):\n\n* Presenter should be independent from GUI framework (QT in my case), so no GUI framework objects used in presenter.\n* View should not access model data directly (adhering to MVP)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The presenter and the view are both part of the presentation layer. So, while the presenter doesn't know anything about the GUI framework, it does know about presentation logic, and presentation\\-related concepts. It just doesn't express them in GUI framework\u2013specific way. E.g., you could have a method on it that returns actions available for an item, encoded as data, and have the view (or some view\\-aware helper function/class) convert those actions into GUI controls. Heck, you could even have a method on it that returns a different presenter for a subview (without knowing what the view actually is \\- it's just designed to have such a method, in order to support presentation logic as conceptualized at a high level).\n\nSuch methods and data structures are what forms the presenter abstraction as seen from the view side. When people hear \"abstraction\", their mind usually jumps to \"abstract class\", but here it's used in this more fundamental sense. Basically, think of it like this: if you're determined to avoid any mention of GUI framework\u2013specific names, what data structures and functions you need to come up with to be able to express the essential features of the presentation logic when writing the presenter? Or perhaps: if you expect a lot of fiddling with the details of the view (color\\-coding, kinds of controls for certain actions, layout, ...), how can you express what these things are about in a way that's relatively resilient to these changes? E.g. a simple example of that is, instead of having an enum `{ Green, Yellow, Red }`, you use `{ OK, Warning, Error }`. The end product of this process is what constitutes your abstraction: the functions, data structures and interfaces at the view\\-facing boundary.\n\nSo, for the situation you're describing, a way to do it would be:\n\n1. The view receives the \"open context menu\" event for a list item\n2. The view (directly or through some mechanism) invokes a \"get actions for \\[item]\" method on the presenter. In this case, it's probably best if the view can obtain the return value of this method, rather than wait for the presenter to subsequently push the result into the view by some other mechanism (that's possible too, but likely more convoluted; e.g., you could pass a lambda as the second parameter and have the presenter call it).\n3. The presenter calls something that knows how to produce a list of actions (or something describing the actions) given the current item, then passes the result along (perhaps after embellishing it with some additional presentation\\-related data).\n4. The view converts these actions into controls (context menu items), or calls something that can do the conversion for it, or relies on some framework mechanism that can, say, instantiate a template, or whatever.\n5. The context menu is shown.\n\nE.g., you could do this within a slot that's connected to the customContextMenuRequested signal.\n\nBut don't stop there. I said that this is \"*a* way to do it\" on purpose. Explore a couple of other options, perhaps even some that are a bit out there, all the while keeping [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) in mind. The goal now is not to predict some future change, but to attempt to get a fresh perspective on the problem.\n\nFor example, suppose that, since there are only a couple of possible actions (bear with me if that's not actually the case), your users ask you to replace the context menu with a set of small buttons (some enabled, some disabled), shown inline with the list item, so that they can save a click. Assuming that it's cheap to determine the available actions, in this case it makes sense to get them together with the items, when first populating the list box. Maybe that's a better abstraction. Perhaps that will let you do things like live update of available actions, in case the state of the selected item can be changed in a different view that's simultaneously visible.\n\nOK, now come back to your current implementation that is based around a context menu. Perhaps it makes sense to do this *anyway*. Perhaps you can calculate all that you need up front, eliminating the need to call the presenter in this case. Nobody can tell you what's the best option here \\- you get to decide based on your understanding of the domain. You get to decide if this is something worth pursuing or if you should apply YAGNI. Another thing to take into account is which of the approaches you've considered offers least friction with the language and the framework, while retaining a good amount of design benefits that you're after \\- because, while you can, in principle, ignore the framework in code, there are practical concerns that mean that you can't really ignore all aspects of it (to various degrees).\n\nNow, the problem is, the views tend to be very fiddly (they tend to be tweaked a lot, especially in the beginning), so it's hard to come up with these abstractions and have them be reasonably stable. Also, people tend to make presenters (and classes in general) too big, responsible for too many things, and thus they hardcode a lot of wrong assumptions into them; this leads to a lot of accidental internal coupling. But then parts of these presenters need to change in different ways, at different rates, for different reasons, and this accidental coupling makes changing things tedious. So one thing that helps is: think smaller, and distribute responsibilities. There doesn't have to be a single presenter \\- you can have a number of collaborating classes; adjust the pattern to suit your specific problem better.\n\nAlso, GUI frameworks and control libraries help in some ways (e.g., they might provide a databinding mechanism, eliminating some boilerplate), but they can also bring in some constraints (e.g., they might be geared more towards getting things up and running quickly for a certain set of scenarios, but can get in your way if you try to do something outside of that, or they might impose a certain style of programming). So you have to find a balance between designing for your needs and not working against the framework too much.\n\n> \"Lets say I have a GUI application which tries to adhere to\n> Model\\-View\\-Presenter (MVP) as best as possible.\"\n\nI know that when you don't yet have a deep understanding of a concepts, it's helpful to follow a set of rules, but this is bit of a double\\-edged sword. There are several variations of the MVP pattern; I'm mentioning this to show you that people have been adjusting the pattern to better suit their specific needs or to work better with the language and the framework they use. So don't be afraid to introduce your own tweaks if you need to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture, you're implementing a feature where a context menu for list items should display different options based on the item's state.

The `Order` would also have a method `AddOrderItem(Product product, int amount)` and the `Order` would check if there is already an `OrderLine` for that specific product.\n\nIn such a model you would also have objects that are not real entities, like a `Repository` for accessing data or a `Factory` for creating entities. These are called Domain Services. An Application Layer is responsible for calling the Domain Services (for example to retrieve an entity from the database) and then it will execute functionality on the entity.

Let me first answer your question, and then explain why I have issues with the other answer.\n\nSuppose you have a Hamiltonian of the form $H \\= H\\_1 \\+ H\\_2$, where $\\[H\\_1, H\\_2] \\= 0$. Then, since $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. That is, there exists an eigenbasis of the form $\\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$ where $H\\_1 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_1 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$ and $H\\_2 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\|\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$. An arbitrary state in your Hilbert space can be written in the form\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\= \\\\sum\\_{\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2} c\\_{\\\\varepsilon\\_1,\\\\varepsilon\\_2} \\|\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle ,\n$$\nbut if your goal is only to find energy eigenstates, you are allowed to assume that you are working in a common eigenstate of $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ separately. This is the complete answer to your question. Note that if $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ didn't commute, then there would not exist a common eigenbasis, and it would not be possible to factorize your wavefunction.\n\nNow, here is the problem with the other answer: *there is no reason to assume that $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ have tensor product structure*. Separation of variables works even when the Hamiltonian is NOT of the form $H \\= H\\_1 \\\\otimes 1 \\+ 1 \\\\otimes H\\_2$. The difference is that when $H$ has this tensor product structure, the eigenvalues $\\\\varepsilon\\_1$ and $\\\\varepsilon\\_2$ can be chosen independently, but this doesn't have to be the case; indeed, *this is not the case for the hydrogen atom!!* In the hydrogen atom, the allowed quantum numbers $(n,\\\\ell,m)$ cannot all be chosen independently, for example $\\\\ell$ is not allowed to exceed $n$. This is indicative of the fact that, while the Hamiltonian splits into two commuting pieces, it does not have the tensor product structure indicated by the other answer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a quantum system with a Hamiltonian of the form H = H1 + H2, where [H1, H2] = 0.

First you need a strategy. \n\nI see five delivery problems here. \n\n* Getting enough pressure of water to climb your hill. Rule of thumb, you lose 1/2 PSI per vertical foot (a little high, but you'll need pressure for flow, too.)\n* Getting enough *volume* of water up the hill for your instantaneous use. Pipe walls have a lot of drag, and you have a lot of pipe walls.\n* Getting electricity down to the pump location. Perhaps ironically there's power right near the pump location, but not on your meter.\n* Getting *enough* electricity to the pump location to satisfy your instantaneous use. Which could be quite a lot.\n* Reliability of the pressure from the water company. OK it's 70 psi *now* and so you pick a location 100 feet up the hill, which 70 psi can serve. But what happens when all your neighbors shower at once and it plunges to 35 psi? Your pump goes dry since 35 psi can't push it up 100 feet! Yowch.\n\nSo there's no question in my mind that I'd put the booster pump as low as possible. That means both a water and electricity run for the full 700 feet, and that ain't chump change. So when reaching for Franklins, I first reach for a sharp pencil and the the old [IBM \"THINK\" sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_(IBM)). \n\n* if you size for instantaneous use \\- abandon the cistern \\- you have two problems. First, pipes and cords must be sized for worst\\-case surge, which means they are **huge and expensive**. (and tempting theft candy). Second, no power \\= no water.\n* Since the cistern has worked for you, what if you keep it? Surge load is absorbed by the cistern, *as it is now*, and the pump and piping only need to refill the cistern (keep it topped up). It can do that at a very low rate with fairly small pump, pipe and wires. Still, no power, no water.\n* Since you own land 700 feet wide and 200 feet high, any chance you own *higher*? Put your cistern up there [(like this guy)](http://purelivingforlife.com/off-grid-water-systems/) and let that .433 PSI per vertical foot *supply your water pressure*. Now you're showering with no power! Also handy for firefighting, something to think about when sizing your cistern. Now your pump down low has to push *even higher*, but again only a trickle, just to top up the cistern.\n\nHonestly, you have to price it all ways and decide which features you want. \n\nSo suppose you want a cistern system that can recover 240 gallons/day (seems like a *lot*.) That's 10 gallons per hour. 10 gallons weighs x8\\.3\\= 83 pounds. If you are lifting 200 ft, that is 83x200\\=16600 foot\\-pounds per hour *of energy*. 1 KWH is 2655220 ft\\-lbs., so this will take you .00625 kilowatt\\-hours per hour, or 6\\.25 watts. That has \"solar\" written all over it \\- derate 80% for solar availability (lifting 50 GPH 20% of the time) and you're still at 31 watts. Easy peasy.\n\nIf we wanted a surge/demand system that could supply 10 GPM, that's 600 GPH, 996000 ft\\-lbs per hour, 375 watt\\-hours per hour, assuming 39% pump efficiency, that's about 4 amps at 240V. 12 AWG wire ($479\\) can do that, but that assumes no friction losses in the pipe, which assumes fat pipe. You'd have to balance the cost of fat pipe vs the cost of thicker wire to pump up thinner pipe. That balance is above my skill level. Normally I'm all about conduit, but in this case I'd direct\\-bury the electrical cable so it isn't stolen."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is planning to pump water up a 200-foot hill over a distance of 700 feet.

By placing a cistern at the top of the hill, gravity can provide water pressure without relying on constant electricity. A small pump at the base, potentially powered by solar energy, can slowly refill the cistern, reducing the need for large, expensive pipes and electrical wiring.

I explicitly don't want my user to have to construct query strings themselves, these will all be explicitly typed parameters on my client(s)' methods.\n\nSo, by the time I've handled all of this, my client class could actually be fairly hefty. As a consequence of this, I'm considering creating a client for each endpoint to handle the validation of query parameters and ensure everything is strongly typed. These can then use a basic, generic \"God Mode\" client internally to do the actual querying.\n\nThe god mode client would look something like this:\n\n```cs\npublic class DiscosClient : IDiscosClient\n{\n    private readonly HttpClient _client;\n    public DiscosClient(HttpClient client)\n    {\n        _client = client;\n    }\n\n    public async Task<DiscosResponse<T>?> Get<T>(string endpoint, string query) where T: DiscosModelBase\n    {\n        return await _client.GetFromJsonAsync<DiscosResponse<T>>($\"{endpoint}?{query}\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, this then means I have a whole bunch of clients which could be a bit of a mess in and of itself.\n\nFor example, I'd need `DiscosObject`, `Propellant`, `Orbit` clients with interfaces like these (I've not added filter parameters to my interfaces yet):\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosObjectClient\n{\n    public Task<List<DiscosObject>> GetObjects();\n    public Task<DiscosObject> GetObject();\n    public Task<List<ObjectClass>> GetObjectClasses();\n    public Task<ObjectClass> GetObjectClass();\n}\n\n```\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosPropellantClient\n{\n    public Task<List<Propellant>> GetPropellants();\n    public Task<Propellant> GetPropellant();\n}\n\n```\n\n```cs\npublic interface IDiscosOrbitClient\n{\n    public Task<List<OrbitDetails>> GetInitialOrbits();\n    public Task<OrbitDetails> GetInitialOrbit();\n    public Task<List<OrbitDetails>> GetDestinationOrbits();\n    public Task<OrbitDetails> GetDestinationOrbit();\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat's the best way to approach this? Should I just have one super\\-client which handles all of these endpoints or should I deconstruct that into many smaller clients? Am I missing an obvious trick?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best way to approach such kind of SDK design is by writing tests which **use** the classes or libs, and **try out** what kind of API will be easier to handle from a users point of view.\n\nBy \"tests\", I don't mean necessarily just a bunch of unit tests. Though unit tests may be a good point to start, you should write a test application, a proof\\-of\\-concept, something large enough to see how the SDK works in reality, but small enough you can still refactor the application, or throw it over board in case a certain design does not satisfy your expectations.\n\nSoftware design in a vacuum does never work well \\- one needs context, and if there isn't enough context yet, create it by yourself."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are designing an SDK for the European Space Agency's DISCOs API.

This allows you to experiment with different designs and API structures, focusing on what will be most usable and practical for end-users. By testing the SDK in realistic scenarios, you can identify potential issues, refine the design, and ensure that the final product meets actual user needs.

There is the always `true` that indicates there must be a `break` or `return` statement *somewhere* inside the block.\n\n```\nint offset = 0;\nwhile(true)\n{\n    Record r = Read(offset);\n    if(r == null)\n    {\n        break;\n    }\n    // do work\n    offset++;\n}\n\n```\n2.

You're concentrating on the picky details of the code but missing the larger picture. Let's take a look at one of your example loops:\n\n```\nint offset = 0;\nwhile(true)\n{\n    Record r = Read(offset);\n    if(r == null)\n    {\n        break;\n    }\n    // do work\n    offset++;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat is the *meaning* of this code? The meaning is \"do some work to each record in a file\". But that is not what the code *looks like*. The code looks like \"maintain an offset. Open a file. Enter a loop with no end condition. Read a record. Test for nullity.\" All that before we get to the work! The question you should be asking is \"*how can I make this code's appearance match its semantics?*\" This code should be:\n\n```\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile())\n    DoWork(record);\n\n```\n\nNow the code reads like its intention. **Separate your mechanisms from your semantics**. In your original code you mix up the mechanism \\-\\- the details of the loop \\-\\- with the semantics \\-\\- the work done to each record.\n\nNow we have to implement `RecordsFromFile()`. What's the best way of implementing that? **Who cares?** That's not the code that anyone is going to be looking at. It's basic mechanism code and its ten lines long. Write it however you want. How about this?\n\n```\npublic IEnumerable<Record> RecordsFromFile()\n{\n    int offset = 0;\n    while(true)\n    {\n        Record record = Read(offset);\n        if (record == null) yield break;\n        yield return record;\n        offset += 1;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow that we are manipulating a *lazily computed sequence of records* all sorts of scenarios become possible:\n\n```\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().Take(10))\n    DoWork(record);\n\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().OrderBy(r=>r.LastName))\n    DoWork(record);\n\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().Where(r=>r.City == \"London\")\n    DoWork(record);\n\n```\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAny time you write a loop, ask yourself \"does this loop read like a mechanism or like the meaning of the code?\" If the answer is \"like a mechanism\", then try to move that mechanism to its own method, and write the code to make the meaning more visible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is refactoring code that reads records from a file.

This makes the code more readable and its intention clearer.

Scoping the output shows about 600 mV, about a diode drop, which I expect. When it is run however, at minimum duty cycle (1/256\\) the output off state is around 2 V. This causes the LEDs to stay relatively bright at their lowest dim setting. Normally I would consider the BJT is not fast enough to drain the current but the PWM frequency is only 400 Hz, so I really can't believe it can't drain whatever is in the FET residually.\n\nAny help is appreciated I really am stumped.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aA4hK.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2faA4hK.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That is a fairly massive [power MOSFET](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/ena2192-d.pdf), with a lot of gate charge \\~250nC.\n\nI would expect it to take the better part of a millisecond to turn off with only a 10k\u03a9 resistor to drain that charge away. The problem isn't the BJT, which is probably fast enough for this application, but rather the resistor.\n\nThe transistor turns the MOSFET 'on' but the 10k\u03a9 resistor has to turn it 'off' so you will get very asymmetrical ton vs. toff. So your 1/256 is stretched.\n\nThis circuit is adequate (perhaps) for static switching but not for PWM with a 100A power MOSFET. You'll need a better gate driver circuit. A band\\-aid solution is to reduce the 10k\u03a9 R2 to maybe 1/5 or 1/10 of that (but watch the resistor power dissipation).\n\nAlternatively, replace that power MOSFET with a BSS84 or something like that (\\~1/300 the gate charge), using a 100A MOSFET to switch 30mA is not ideal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the high-side PWM LED dimmer circuit described, why does the LED remain relatively bright at the lowest dim setting (1/256 duty cycle)?\n\nA) The BJT is not fast enough to drain the residual current in the FET\nB) The PWM frequency of 400 Hz is too high for the circuit components\nC) The power MOSFET has excessive gate charge that cannot be drained quickly enough by the 10k\u03a9 resistor\nD) The Zener diode across the gate and source is preventing proper switching\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The issue stems from the power MOSFET (ATP304-TL-H) having a very high gate charge (~250nC). With only a 10k\u03a9 resistor to drain this charge, it takes nearly a millisecond for the MOSFET to turn off completely. This results in asymmetrical on and off times, effectively stretching the intended 1/256 duty cycle. The 10k\u03a9 resistor is inadequate for quickly discharging the gate, causing the MOSFET to remain partially on even during the \"off\" portion of the PWM cycle. This keeps the LED brighter than intended at the lowest dim setting.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the BJT is likely fast enough for this application; the problem lies with the MOSFET and its gate discharge.\nAnswer B is incorrect as 400 Hz is not too high for the circuit components; the issue is with the gate discharge time, not the PWM frequency itself.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Zener diode is there to protect against exceeding VGS(max) and is not the cause of the switching problem."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/24", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/231404", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/75502/"], "docs_id": 231404, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The definition of [electronvolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt) (eV) from wiki is \n\n> In physics, the electronvolt (symbol eV; also written electron volt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately 160 zeptojoules (symbol zJ) or 1\\.6\u00d710\u221219 joules (symbol J).

It concerns a formula that I have always found fascinating. For, at first glance, it appears completely \"obvious\", while on closer examination it does not even seem well\\-defined. The formula is the one that I was given as the definition of the cross\\-product in $\\\\mathbb R^3 $ when I was first introduced to that concept: \n\n$$\n B \\\\times C :\\= \n \\\\det \n\\\\begin{vmatrix}\n {\\\\mathbf i } \\& {\\\\mathbf j } \\& {\\\\mathbf k } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n B\\_1 \\& B\\_2 \\& B\\_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n C\\_1 \\& C\\_2 \\& C\\_3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n\\\\end{vmatrix}\n$$ \nOn the one hand, if one expands this by minors of the first row, the result is clearly correct\\-\\-\\-and to this day this is the only way I can recall the formula for the components of the cross\\-product when I need it. But, on the other hand, the determinant of an $n \\\\times n$ matrix whose elements are a mixture of scalars and vectors is undefined. Just think what happens if you interchange one element of the first row with the element just below it. In fact, as usually understood, for a determinant of a matrix to be well\\-defined, its elements should all belong to a commutative ring. But then again (on the third hand :\\-) if we take the dot product of both sides of the formula with a third vector, $A$, we seem to get: \n\n$$\n A \\\\cdot B \\\\times C \\= \n A \\\\cdot \n \\\\det \n\\\\begin{vmatrix}\n {\\\\mathbf i } \\& {\\\\mathbf j } \\& {\\\\mathbf k } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n B\\_1 \\& B\\_2 \\& B\\_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n C\\_1 \\& C\\_2 \\& C\\_3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{vmatrix}\n \\= \n \\\\det \n\\\\begin{vmatrix}\n A\\_1 \\& A\\_2 \\& A\\_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n B\\_1 \\& B\\_2 \\& B\\_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n C\\_1 \\& C\\_2 \\& C\\_3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n\\\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nand of course the left and right hand sides are well\\-known formulas for the (signed) volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors, $A, B, C$. Moreover, the validity of the latter formula for all choices of $A$ indicates that the original formula is \"correct\". \n\nSo, my question is this: Is there a rigorous way of defining the original determinant so that all of the above becomes meaningful and correct? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: But there is a commutative ring available, along the lines of what Mariano says. If $k$ is a field and $V$ is a vector space, then $k \\\\oplus V$ is a commutative ring by the rule that a scalar times a scalar, or a scalar times a vector, or a vector times a scalar, are all what you think they are. The only missing part is a vector times a vector, and you can just set that to zero. The dot product is then a special bilinear form on the algebra. In the formalism, I think that everything that you wrote makes sense.\n\n---\n\nTheo says in a comment that \"even better\", one should work over $\\\\Lambda^\\*(V)$, the exterior algebra over $V$. The motivation is that this algebra is supercommutative. I considered mentioning this solution, and supposed that I really should have, because it arises in important formulas. For example, the Gauss formula for the linking number between two knots $K\\_1, K\\_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ is:\n$$\\\\mathrm{lk}(K\\_1,K\\_2\\) \\= \\\\int\\_{K\\_1 \\\\times K\\_2} \\\\frac{\\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\vec{x} \\- \\\\vec{y} \\\\\\\\ d\\\\vec{x} \\\\\\\\ d\\\\vec{y} \\\\end{bmatrix}}{4\\\\pi \\|\\\\vec{x} \\- \\\\vec{y}\\|^3}$$\n$$\\= \\\\int\\_{K\\_1 \\\\times K\\_2}\n\\\\frac{\\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} x\\_1 \\- y\\_1 \\& x\\_2 \\- y\\_2 \\& x\\_3 \\- y\\_3 \\\\\\\\\ndx\\_1 \\& dx\\_2 \\& dx\\_3 \\\\\\\\ dy\\_1 \\& dy\\_2 \\& dy\\_3 \\\\end{bmatrix}}{4\\\\pi \\|\\\\vec{x} \\- \\\\vec{y}\\|^3}.$$\nThe right way to write and interpret this formula is indeed as a determinant in the exterior algebra of differential forms. For one reason, it makes it easy to generalize Gauss' formula to higher dimensions.\n\nHowever, supercommutative is not the same as commutative, and this type of determinant has fewer properties than a determinant over a commutative ring. And different properties. Such a determinant has a broken symmetry: you get a different answer if you order the factors in each term by rows than by columns. (I am using row ordering.) Indeed, the row\\-ordered determinant can be non\\-zero even if it has repeated rows. To give two examples, the determinant in the generalized Gauss formula has repeated rows, and the standard volume form in $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is\n$$\\\\omega \\= \\\\frac{\\\\det ( d\\\\vec{x}, d\\\\vec{x}, \\\\ldots, d\\\\vec{x} )}{n!}.$$\n\nHappily, for Dick's question, you can truncate the exterior algebra at degree 1, which is exactly what I did. This truncation is both supercommutative and commutative."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the cross product formula in \u211d\u00b3:\n\nB \u00d7 C := det |i j k|\n             |B\u2081 B\u2082 B\u2083|\n             |C\u2081 C\u2082 C\u2083|\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the mathematical interpretation and rigorous definition of this formula?\n\nA) The determinant is well-defined as it is, because vectors and scalars can be freely mixed in a determinant calculation.\n\nB) The formula is meaningless and cannot be rigorously defined due to the mixing of vectors and scalars in the determinant.\n\nC) The formula can be rigorously defined by considering the determinant in the exterior algebra \u039b*(V) over the vector space V.\n\nD) The formula can be made rigorous by defining a commutative ring structure on k \u2295 V, where k is a field and V is a vector space, with vector multiplication defined as zero.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As explained in the top answer, we can define a commutative ring structure on k \u2295 V, where k is a field (in this case, the real numbers) and V is the vector space (\u211d\u00b3). In this structure, scalar-scalar, scalar-vector, and vector-scalar multiplications are defined as usual, while vector-vector multiplication is set to zero. This approach allows for a rigorous definition of the determinant that includes both scalars and vectors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because mixing vectors and scalars in a determinant is not well-defined in standard linear algebra.\n\nOption B is too extreme; while the formula appears problematic at first glance, there are ways to make it rigorous.\n\nOption C, while related to an advanced approach mentioned in the comments, is not the most direct or simple way to address the issue presented in the original question.\n\nOption D provides a straightforward and rigorous way to define the determinant that aligns with the intuitive understanding of the cross product formula."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/24", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/136041", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/83513/"], "docs_id": 136041, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been facing a really hard kernel panic problem.\nI bought this macbook pro 17\" about 5 months ago and at that time I had a few kernel panics but didn't event bothered cause I could still use it anyway.\n\nA month from now I couldn't even work cause there would be kp's every 5 minutes.

I called Apple and the rep said that if power cycling the phone and \"forgetting\" the wifi network didn't help, the Apple database would clear stale entries after 30 to 60 days. Sure enough, after about a month my phone started showing the new location.\n\n(Note: I tried @bmike's procedure several times on each of the iPhones in our household, but it didn't seem to make a difference. It could be that the procedure does remove *that* phone's historical location info from Apple's database, but over the many years we were living at our old address we had enough guests with iPhones that removing only our own phones' records wasn't sufficient. If anyone else is having this problem you might as well try that procedure, but know that the problem will self\\-resolve within a month or so.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A MacBook Pro user is experiencing frequent kernel panics.

At this point I try to setup the user management. We are running a NIS environment on our campus, so until now I added the line \\+testuser::::: to the /etc/passwd file which then received the user information over NIS. What I want to achieve is that I have a set of admin users (admin1, admin2 and admin3\\) which can log in to every machine and a set of users (user1, user2 and user3\\) which are different on every machines. At the end of the passwd file I need an entry line \\+::::::/sbin/nologin to have all users information available but grant no access to them.\n\nSo /etc/passwd on one machine would look like\n\n```\n+admin1::::::\n+admin2::::::\n+admin3::::::\n+user1::::::\n+user2::::::\n+::::::/sbin/nologin\n\n```\n\nand on an other machine\n\n```\n+admin1::::::\n+admin2::::::\n+admin3::::::\n+user1::::::\n+user3::::::\n+::::::/sbin/nologin\n\n```\n\nBecause the admin users are rather static but the normal users vary from system to system, I thought to declare the admin users in a module and the normal users on a per node basis.\n\nMy first problem is, how to edit the /etc/passwd file to add the lines. Furthermore it's important that the sorting is correct, so that the nologin line is at the end. Do you have any idea how to achieve this in a flexible manner?\n\nThanks and regards \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Puppet will edit `/etc/passwd` on its own accord, when you add `user` resources to your manifest, such as\n\n```\nuser {\n    'admin1':\n        ensure => present,\n        uid => 1003,\n        password => '$6$...',\n}\n\n```\n\nOrdering of existing lines will be tricky at best. Puppet natively does not support anything like that. My advice would be to use an `exec` resource like this:\n\n```\nexec {\n    '/path/to/script-that-moves-nologin-line-to-the-end':\n        unless => '/script/that/returns-true-if-nologins-line-is-currently-at-the-end'\n}\n\n```\n\nYou would want Puppet to perform that after syncing all user resources to your system. There are different ways to go about that, all with their pros and cons.\n\nAssuming your manifests are not too complex, you can likely get away with global defaults for the `user` type.\n\n```\nUser { before => Exec['/path/to/script-that-moves-nologin-line-to-the-end'] }\n\n```\n\nJust be careful that no `user` resources overwrites this with a different `before` value.\n\nOther alternatives include\n\n* overriding the the `before` value of all existing `user` resources with a [resource collector](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_collectors.html)\n* [run stages](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_run_stages.html)\n* gathering your `user` resources in few classes and just add `require => Class[...]` to the `exec`\n\nAmong others that are probably conceivable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are using Puppet to manage user accounts on RHEL servers in a NIS environment. You need to ensure that admin users can log in to every machine, while regular users vary per machine. Additionally, you want to add a line at the end of /etc/passwd to prevent unauthorized access. Which combination of Puppet resources and techniques would be most appropriate to achieve this, while ensuring proper ordering of entries in the /etc/passwd file?\n\nA) Use only 'user' resources in Puppet and rely on Puppet's built-in ordering capabilities to manage /etc/passwd\n\nB) Combine 'user' resources with a custom 'exec' resource to move the nologin line to the end, using global defaults for ordering\n\nC) Use 'file' resources to directly manipulate the /etc/passwd file content, including all user entries and the nologin line\n\nD) Implement run stages in Puppet to separate user creation from the addition of the nologin line, ensuring correct order\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate solution because:\n\n1. It uses Puppet's 'user' resources to manage individual user accounts, which is the recommended way to handle user management in Puppet.\n\n2.

In control theory this circuit is known as a **PD\\-T1 unit**. It has a proportional\\-derivative behaviour with a certain delay term T1\\. In filter terms, it works like a first\\-order high\\-pass with a superimposed constant gain.\n\nThe transfer function is \\\\$H(s)\\= 1 \\+ sR1 \\\\cdot \\\\dfrac{C}{1\\+sR2C}\\\\$\n\nThis device is used to enhance the phase (for stabilizing purposes) in a certain frequency range.

For this purpose, the non\\-inv. input is dc biased with 50% of the supply voltage \\- with the consequence that the input signal must be coupled via an input capacitor. Because the dc gain remains unity, the bias voltage is transferred to the output also with the gain of \"1\".\n\n**BODE diagram**: The magnitude starts at unity and begins to rise at \\\\$wz\\=\\\\dfrac{1}{(R1\\+R2\\)C}\\\\$, then it stops rising at \\\\$wp\\=1/R2C\\\\$ at a gain value of \\\\$1\\+(R1/R2\\)\\\\$.

In it the author suggests that a natural first question to ask is, \n\n> What is the probability of a random natural number being prime?\n\nbut proceeds to dismiss it as \"not making sense\". I wonder what's wrong with the question. Is its meaninglessness related to the fact that there is an infinite number of naturals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's no uniform random distribution on the natural numbers, so the problem is with the phrase \"random natural number\". One cannot, for example, \"pick a natural number at random\", a fact which can be illustrated by the following thought experiment: How many digits should a natural number picked at random have?\n\nOn the other hand, we can view the question asymptotically: If $\\\\pi(x)$ is the [number of prime numbers less than $x$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function), we can study the ratio\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x}$$\nas $x$ grows large. By the [prime number theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem),\n$$\\\\lim\\_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x} \\\\ln(x) \\= 1,$$\nso since $\\\\ln(x)$ is unbounded, the percentage of numbers less than $x$ that are prime becomes arbitrarily small as $x$ becomes arbitrarily large. In the asymptotic sense, then, the \"probability of a natural number being prime\" is zero, because\n$$\\\\lim\\_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x} \\= 0\\.$$\n\nEdit: Let me elaborate a bit on why there isn't a uniform random distribution on $\\\\newcommand{\\\\N}{\\\\mathbb{N}}\\\\N$ (or on any countably infinite set, for that matter). To talk about probability, we must have a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_%28mathematics%29), i.e., a function $\\\\mu$ sending \"nice\" subsets of $\\\\N$ to $\\[0, \\+\\\\infty]$. (What constitutes a \"nice\" subset is a technical detail that doesn't really matter here; actually, as with topological spaces and open sets, which sets are measurable is part of the data of the measure space.)\n\nThe main axiom for measures is that they're *countably additive*, that is, additive over countably infinite, pairwise disjoint collections of sets. So, if $A\\_0, A\\_1, A\\_2, A\\_3, \\\\ldots$ is a collection of measurable subsets such that $A\\_i \\\\cap A\\_j \\= \\\\emptyset$ whenever $i \\\\neq j$, then\n$$\\\\mu\\\\left( \\\\bigcup\\_{i \\\\in \\\\N} A\\_i \\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in \\\\N} \\\\mu(A\\_i).$$\nIf we try to define a *uniform* measure on $\\\\N$, let $A\\_i \\= \\\\{i\\\\}$. Since the measure is uniform, we must have $\\\\mu(\\\\{i\\\\}) \\= \\\\mu(\\\\{j\\\\})$ for all $i, j \\\\in \\\\N$. So by countable additivity,\n$$\\\\mu(\\\\N) \\= \\\\mu\\\\left( \\\\bigcup\\_{i \\\\in \\\\N} \\\\{i\\\\} \\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in \\\\N} \\\\mu(\\\\{i\\\\}) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in \\\\N} \\\\mu(\\\\{0\\\\}).$$\nIf $\\\\mu(\\\\{0\\\\}) \\= 0$, then $\\\\mu(\\\\N) \\= 0$, so $\\\\mu$ assigns zero to every set. If $\\\\mu(\\\\{0\\\\}) \\> 0$, then $\\\\mu(\\\\N) \\= \\+\\\\infty$. But a probability measure is, by definition, a measure such that the whole space has measure 1\\. Therefore, there is no uniform probability measure on $\\\\N$.\n\nOn the other hand, we can often define uniform probability measures on *uncountably* infinite sets with no problem. For example, the [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure) on $\\[0, 1]$ is defined so that $\\\\mu(\\[a, b]) \\= b \\- a$ for any $0 \\\\leq a \\< b \\\\leq 1$. The reason this works is that measures don't have to be uncountably additive, just countably additive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why it's not possible to define a uniform probability distribution on the set of natural numbers?\n\nA) The set of natural numbers is too large to be measured accurately.\nB) Prime numbers are not evenly distributed among natural numbers.\nC) Any uniform measure on natural numbers would violate the property of countable additivity.\nD) The prime number theorem prevents a uniform distribution on natural numbers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

But I am not sure of the idea carrying to the necessity in the decimal system \\-\\- why not start an index from 1?\n\nDoes anyone have historical knowledge of programming languages where the decision to begin indexes at zero may have been explained?\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: The Dijkstra writings are further helpful from a mathematical standpoint, but even has he noted, not all languages are zero\\-indexed. WBT's explanation also makes sense as to why one would start with zero based on memory addresses. (I know some languages handle indexing slightly different based on array manipulation.)\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for the *why* (which I very much appreciate because it helps further an understanding) but more along the lines of *when* did this become the convention and/or whether it can be traced to a specific language.\n\nSo, for instance in K\\&R's C, when discussing array indexes, K or R matter\\-of\\-factly explains, \"Array subscripts always start at zero in C...\" (p. 22\\) Later, in discussing a function to process character arrays, \"... a more useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end\\-of\\-file return because it never is a valid line length.\" (p. 127\\)\n\nBased on K\\&R, I gather a) the convention is adopted from elsewhere, so C is not the inspiration behind zero\\-indexing and b) there are possibly deeper reasons for its use based on the second example. I know K\\&R is so widely regarded for its clear prose, so that's another reason I include it, to give an example of what I had hoped another documented language would do to explain the reason behind zero\\-indexing.\n\nI think both WBT and btilly offer equally good reasons; I wondered if anyone who perhaps knew old (pre\\-C?) languages which documented the design decision. And at the same time I recognize such information may not exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's about offsets. You have an address, which points to the location in memory where the array begins. Then to access any element, you multiply the array index by the size of the element and add it to the starting address, to find the address for that element. \n\nThe first element is at the starting point, so you multiply the size of the element by *zero* to get *zero* which is what you add to the starting address to find the location of the first element.\n\nThe convention spread because programmers started working in very low\\-level languages where memory addresses were directly manipulated and in most cases building up from there, maintaining the same convention at each step so that they wouldn't have to relearn or be prone to mistakes when switching between conventions. It's still important to understand how this addressing works especially when working with lower\\-level languages. I agree this can be a stumbling block for people who are first learning to program in a higher\\-level language. \n\nThe [Wikipedia article on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#Origin) also cites a common machine instruction used when working \"backwards\" and detecting the end of a loop, namely \"decrement and jump if zero.\" \n\nAn exception: MATLAB [and some other languages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1499749/list-of-1-indexed-programming-languages) bucked the trend and went with an index starting at 1, apparently under the impression that it would be a first programming language for a lot of their target users and that for those folks, starting with 1 makes more intuitive sense. This causes some frustrations for the (relatively small subset of?) programmers who frequently switch between programming languages that start counting at different values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the historical reason for zero-based indexing in most programming languages?\n\nA) It was arbitrarily chosen by early programmers and became a convention over time.\nB) It's based on the binary number system, where counting starts at zero.\nC) It relates to memory addressing, where the first element is at an offset of zero from the starting address.\nD) It was introduced by the C programming language and adopted by others that followed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Zero-based indexing originated from low-level programming practices related to memory addressing. When accessing elements in an array, the index is multiplied by the element size and added to the starting address. For the first element, this offset is zero, hence the zero-based index. This convention was established in early, low-level languages where direct memory manipulation was common, and it persisted as higher-level languages developed to maintain consistency and avoid confusion for programmers working across different levels of abstraction.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it wasn't arbitrary, but based on practical considerations of memory addressing.\nAnswer B is incorrect because while programming often involves binary, the zero-based indexing is not directly related to the binary number system.\nAnswer D is incorrect because zero-based indexing predates C and was not introduced by it, though C did adopt and help popularize this convention."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/19", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/235422", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/180279/"], "docs_id": 235422, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to be able to paste an image in a new blank page in Preview.app but do not see this option in the program.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a workaround I use that suffices since I rarely use Preview, so there may be better options than this.\n\nTypically, when creating a new image in image editing software you'll be prompted for things such as resolution, background, etc. So I've created a bunch of default images I keep stored in a folder with descriptive filenames such as:\n\n* 500x500 transparent image\n* 500x500 white image\n* 500x1000 transparent image\n* and so on\n\nOn the rare occasion I have to start from scratch using Preview, I just open the image I need and do a Save As...

By `delegates` I mean the feature of the language, C\\# for instance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A delegate is a just a class with no data and one method. This is easy to implement in almost any OO language, including even C\\#, and certainly Java.\n\nC\\# (using a delegate):\n\n```\npublic delegate bool Test( int, int );\n// And in some other class/method:\n    SortEm.sort( ilist, (a, b) => a < b );\n// And in static class SortEm:\npublic static void sort( int[] list, Test test )  {\n    ...\n    if (test( x, y ))  {\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nJava:\n\n```\npublic interface JDelegate  {\n    public boolean test( int a, int b );\n}\n// And in some other class/method:\n    SortEm.sort( ilist,\n        // Anonymous Class\n        new JDelegate()  {\n            @Override public boolean test( int a, int b )  { return a < b; }\n        }\n    );\n// And in class SortEm:\npublic static void sort( int[] list, JDelegate sorter )  {\n    ...\n    if (sorter.test( x, y ))  {\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nThe Java needs a bit more typing. It does use existing concepts rather than creating new ones (*delegate*, for instance), which makes it easier if you're coming back to Java after spending a year on C. Also, the \"JDelegate\" interface can become a lot more elaborate if needed, as can the class actually passed, which could be a named (rather than anonymous) class implementing JDelegate.\n\nThe big C\\# edge in this is that the most commonly used section in this code is the call to sort\\-\\-one line versus four, in this case.
