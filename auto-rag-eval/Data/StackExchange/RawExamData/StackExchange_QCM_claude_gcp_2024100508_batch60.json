But both moon and earth attract themselves towards them. So why doesn't earth goes round the moon? It is feeling a force too.

The effect on Earth is in reality even smaller than visualized here (and the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular). \n\nHad the two objects had the same masses, then the orbital motions would have been equal:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBEO7.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBEO7.gif) [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zv7vE.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zv7vE.gif)\n\nThe issue is what \"rotating around something\" exactly means. You could say that neither of the objects rotate around each other in any of the cases shown \\- because in fact they rotate around their shared \"mid\\-point\", so to say. This point is called the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter). The barycenter is the point that their gravitational influences \"average down to\", if we were to imagine a stationary non\\-orbiting object that they both rotated around.\n\nA smaller (less massive) object gives a weaker gravitational pull, thus causing a smaller centripetal acceleration of the more massive object, giving it a smaller orbit and smaller orbital speed. This is the case for the Earth\\-Moon system.\n\nAlthough the mechanism is the same, and they both still rotate around the barycenter, the more massive Earth is rather \"wobbling\" than rotating/orbiting. It **is** still orbiting about the barycenter, but that barycenter is located **inside it** not far from it's own centre.\n\nSome good illustrations of the real barycenter location in the Earth\\-Moon system are found in [this answer](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/14370) on the Astronomy SE site, visualizing how close that barycentre is to Earth's own centre and therefore how little an effect the Moon has on Earth."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Earth-Moon system rotates around a point called the barycenter.

This is due to the significant mass difference between the two bodies. As a result, the Earth experiences a slight \"wobble\" or movement around this internal point, while the Moon's orbital motion is much more pronounced. This arrangement reflects the gravitational interaction between the two bodies, with the more massive Earth exerting a stronger influence on the system's center of mass.

The idea is to describe two populations (one receiving an assistance program (the \"treatment\") and one not receiving it) via a summary statistic.\n\nThe first statistic that I am using is the difference in average wage\\-level post\\-treatment between the two populations.\n\nTo calculate a p\\-value for such a set\\-up, the idea is to make a large number $N$ of random permutations of the assignment vector (the list of 0's and 1's that indicates whether a given observation belongs to the control population or not). I calculate the summary statistic for each of these random assignments, to get a distribution of summary statistics in counterfactual experiments where the control group had been different.\n\nSince I also have the summary statistic for the observed assignment vector (the actual vector of 0's and 1's for the experiment that was truly observed), I can then count the number of simulated summary statistics which are more extreme than the observed summary statistic. \n\nThis proportion out of all of my simulated trials serves as the estimated p\\-value for my summary statistic.\n\nMy question is as follows: is there a standard way to get a standard error for such an estimated p\\-value? Obviously, I can calculate the Monte Carlo standard error for the summary statistics in my simulations, but since all of the simulations are used for just one single p\\-value calculation, it''s not clear how to get the standard error for that.\n\nI had the following thought about what the standard error might be in this case.\n\nIn usual Monte Carlo, we have some function $f$ that we compute at each of the simulated draws $x\\_{i}$ (where here, the $x\\_{i}$ are understood to be the assignment vectors). If I define:\n\n$$ f(x\\_{i}) \\= \\\\mathbb{1}\\_{ \\|stat(x\\_{i})\\| \\> \\|stat(x\\_{obs})\\| } $$\n\nthen it seems that the p\\-value I calculate is given by\n\n$$ \\\\hat{p} \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N}f(x\\_{i}) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{\\# more extreme}}{\\\\textrm{total samples}}$$\n\nAnd following the usual Monte Carlo formulas, would it then make sense to write the variance of the estimate as:\n\n$$ Var(\\\\hat{p}) \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N}\\[ f(x\\_{i}) \\- \\\\hat{p} ]^{2} $$\n\nand then take the square root to obtain the standard error?\n\nThe reason this confuses me is that for each $i$, $f(x\\_{i})$ will be binary, either the computed statistic was more extreme in that iteration or it wasn't. It seems like it would be error prone to sum up a bunch of binary things like that to estimate the variance in a p\\-value, but that could just be my unfamiliarity with this method.\n\nCan anyone confirm that this is right? Also, if I exposed any other ignorance about what I am doing here, corrective comments are appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have correctly computed the variance of $f$, not the variance of $\\\\hat{p}$.

Using an event observer allows for modifying the behavior without directly overriding the controller, which can lead to conflicts with other extensions. This method is more maintainable and less likely to break when multiple extensions try to modify the same controller.\n\nOption A, while common, is discouraged as it can lead to conflicts when multiple extensions try to rewrite the same controller.\n\nOption B is never recommended as it involves modifying core Magento files directly, which can cause issues during upgrades.\n\nOption D, like option A, can potentially cause conflicts with other extensions that might also be trying to modify the category controller behavior.\n\nThe event observer approach (option C) provides a clean, non-conflicting way to inject custom logic into the category view process without the drawbacks associated with direct controller rewrites or core modifications."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/07/11", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/565051", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/259549/"], "docs_id": 565051, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know that the TV and radio waves that are received and transmitted are non mechanical waves.\n\nHowever during storms or bad weather in general, the television signals get weaker and the program becomes laggy or terminates.\n\nMy electrician told me it is because due to the clouds the waves cannot reach the receiver properly.\n\nWhy exactly does it happen?

Then, I use that parameter to fit statsmodel's logit model to the data (lambda \\= 1/C). At this step, I removed coefficients that are really small (\\< 1e\\-5\\). When I performed cross validation again on the reduced feature set to estimate my second penalty parameter, it ends up being stronger than the first penalty. This doesn't seem right to me, since the second step should be to find better estimates for features that you've already identified as non\\-zero from the first feature reduction step (so the lambda should be weaker). \n\nI've also noticed that a lot of p values for the coefficients in the statsmodel results are NaN, even though the model has converged. Does this happen because there is high multicollinearity among my features? I had assumed that the Lasso would be able to handle collinearity. Perhaps my cross validation isn't providing the best penalty parameter? \n\nFrom Elements of Statistical Learning: \n\n> ...the lasso shrinkage causes the estimates of the non\\-zero coefficients to be biased towards zero, and in general they are not consistent. One approach for reducing this bias is to run the lasso to identify the set of non\\-zero coefficients, and then fit an unrestricted linear model to the selected set of features. This is not always feasible, if the selected set is large. Alternatively, one can use the lasso to select the set of non\\-zero predictors, and then apply the lasso again, but using only the selected predictors from the first step. This is known as the relaxed lasso (Meinshausen, 2007\\). The idea is to use cross\\-validation to estimate the initial penalty parameter for the lasso, and then again for a second penalty parameter applied to the selected set of predictors. Since Statistical consistency means as the sample size grows, the estimates converge to the true values. The variables in the second step have less \u201ccompetition\u201d from noise variables, cross\\-validation will tend to pick a smaller value for \u03bb, and hence their coefficients will be shrunken less than those in the initial estimate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It looks like the summary table for logit always gives a NaN standard error for parameters whose coefficient estimate is shrunk to zero. Is this where you are seeing NaN standard errors?

But many of the same concerns ultimately apply: does an object have the desired methods and attributes? Do those attributes have valid, in\\-range values? \n\nWhether you're writing constraints in code, or writing test cases, or validating user input, or just debugging, inevitably *somewhere* you'll need to verify that an object is still in a proper state\\-\\-that it still \"looks like a duck\" and \"quacks like a duck.\"\n\nIn statically typed languages you can simply declare \"`int x`\", and anytime you create or mutate `x`, it will always be a valid `int`. **It seems feasible to decorate a Python object to ensure that it is valid under certain constraints, and that every time that object is mutated it is *still* valid under those constraints.** Ideally there would be a simple declarative syntax to express \"hasattr length and length is non\\-negative\" (not in those words. Not unlike Rails validators, but less human\\-language and more programming\\-language). You could think of this as ad\\-hoc interface/type system, or you could think of it as an ever\\-present object\\-level unit test.\n\n**Does such a library exist to declare and validate constraint/duck\\-checking on Python\\-objects?** Is this an unreasonable tool to want? :)\n\n(Thanks!)\n\n---\n\nContrived example:\n\n```\nrectangle = {'length': 5, 'width': 10}\n\n# We live in a fictional universe where multiplication is super expensive.  \n# Therefore any time we multiply, we need to cache the results.\n\ndef area(rect):\n    if 'area' in rect:\n        return rect['area']\n    rect['area'] = rect['length'] * rect['width']\n    return rect['area']\n\nprint area(rectangle)\nrectangle['length'] = 15\nprint area(rectangle) # compare expected vs. actual output!\n\n# imagine the same thing with object attributes rather than dictionary keys.\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Today, python offers a wide spectrum of tests than can be done for testing duck\\-type coding.\n\nType Annotations\n================\n\nImplementations\n---------------\n\nFor starters, static, compile time type\\-checking ability was added to Python 3 in 2015\\.\n\nNow, there are multiple third\\-party libraries that provide an implementations for the new type\\-checking hooks.\n\n1. [MyPy](http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html \"MyPy\") \u2014 data type\\-checking only (fulfills Python 3 type annotation capability)\n2. [PyContracts](https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/ \"PyContracts\") \u2014 same Python 3 type as in MyPy above, plus allows conjunctive value constraint(s), which is like what you are talking about.\n\nMyPy is pretty slick.\n\nIt even supports [overloaded](http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/function_overloading.html \"overloaded\") function parameter constraints, so that a function can have different return value type if it takes different parameter value types, for instance, using @overload decorator.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nIf in your example above, 'length' and 'width' values were passed as discrete parameters, like:\n\n```python\ndef area(length: 'int,>0', width: 'int,>0') -> int:\n    pass\n\n```\n\nthen, PyContracts could easily do individual type/value checks.\n\nPyContracts can work with the dictionary you specified too, as\\-is.\n\n```python\ndef area(rect: 'dict(str: int)') -> int:\n    pass\n\n```\n\n---\n\nProblems with PyDBC\n-------------------\n\nThough it was slick for its time, nowadays, the drawbacks I see with [PyDBC](http://www.nongnu.org/pydbc/) are:\n\n1. There is a slight performance hit to running these precondition/postcondition tests. They're dynamic, run time tests. Python 3 type annotations are done using static analysis.\n2. Rewriting code at runtime, for one purpose, in a one\\-off way, that is scattered throughout your program, can be too brittle to be worth the bargain. Works fine with one use. What if some other technique/tool does that too? One can get into conflicts where the only way to get out of them is to drop one tool or another after depending upon it a long time. Cleaner ways to do this have evolved for Python since PyDBC was invented.\n3. Explicit declarative constructs, like Python function decorators and Python 3 type annotations, are going to be instantly recognizable/understood by any programmer familiar with Python. They won't spot the implicitly invoked functions. Once they are told, they may forget, may copy or rename the primary function and forget the precondition/postcondition sidekicks. Automated tools are going to treat those extra 2 functions as independent, when they intent is that they are not.\n4. The **metaclass** *attribute* feature of Python 2 no longer works in Python 3\\. It is ignored. Instead, metaclass\\= is specified in class declarations in Python 3\\. Nowadays, new projects start in Python 3 and Python 2 is legacy.\n5. Python 3 has reworked the type system slightly going from early Python 2 to recent Python 3\\. A Python 2 metaclass\\-based solution may not work with Python 3 without rewriting/retesting it.\n6. Metaclasses are not module\\-wide now, can only be specified per class, and there can only be one metaclass per class. So it is a preciously applied feature of a class.\n\n---\n\nUnit Testing\n============\n\nTo take things farther, into the realm of checking post\\-conditions, which is appropriate for testing in the fashion of TDD or BDD, one might be better off writing unit tests\u2014particularly if the desire is to test side effects.\n\nTDD unit tests with unittest\n----------------------------\n\nPython comes with a unittest package that works fine for verifying external behavior effects of a class are correct.\n\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>\n\nIt's very handy to use. If you want to test all of your boundary cases (like dimensions\\<\\=0\\), normal case, and any exceptions it supports in the future, it's the right place for it.\n\nBDD testing\n-----------\n\nThere are some third\\-party programming tools for BDD (behavior\\-driven design). Which ones are popular/supported will probably change over time.\n\nIn my opinion, BDD test scenarios tend to be easier to read/understand. They're readable, possibly even slightly extendable, by non\\-Python programmers. The step language is pretty simple.\n\ndoctest comments/tool\n---------------------\n\nAlternatively, one could include executable examples in the area function's doc string and test it by running doctest\u2014a standard feature of Python for far more than a decade.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest>\n\nBy using doctest, tests would be part of the documentation, inline and generated, as both useful examples and convenient tests.\n\nThose are appropriate ways to check that external state/logic of the function is working properly, given fully met preconditions. They tend to offer different side benefits as well.\n\n---\n\nDecorators\n==========\n\nOne can also use Python 3 decorators to declare preconditions and post conditions. The @precondition would be checked on entry. The @postcondition would be checked on exit.\n\nThis would allow you to enforce design by contract (DBC) with very little code at all.\n\nTo illustrate this listing 10, the @require decorator sample function, in this Dr. Dobb's magazine article, which shows how to implement a powerfully declarative, yet fully reusable, precondition\\-checking decorator in just 10 lines of regular Python code.\n\n[http://www.drdobbs.com/web\\-development/python\\-24\\-decorators/184406073](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/python-24-decorators/184406073)\n\nYou could write a post condition verification decorator based on this @require example, and name them @precondition and @postcondition.\n\nJust be careful. The example uses eval, and there is no parameter sanity\\-checking or constraining, so someone might put something. Really awkward. Of course, that's a possibility other places as well, but I feel like I should raise awareness since eval/exec uses should always kept in mind as a concern.\n\n---\n\nPython 3 includes a library called **functools** that actually offers 2 capabilities handy for your problem.\n\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html>\n\n1. It has a decorator that provides a LRU (least recently used) cache for memoization of a decorated function's return values: @functools.lru\\_cache\n2. It eases writing decorator functions.\n\nOn the 1st point, that strikes your need to test the memoization feature; supplied, pretested functionality. Memoization is a very handy efficiency tool. In addition to reusing existing code, using lru\\_cache decorator is going to make your area function much more transparent.\n\nAnyone would be able to see that there is memoization (results caching) going on, without needing to read all of its source code, just by seeing the lru\\_cache decorator. They would know it's tested code too, not some embedded, one\\-off logic.\n\nFor the second, if you needed something more robust, complex, or implementation specific than the Dr. Dobb's example, functools may speed your efforts. \n\nParticularly, you should look at the **@functools.wraps** decorator. It not only saves a couple of lines of code, but makes the metadata more intuitively correct an useful.\n\n---\n\nError\\-Proofing\n===============\n\nThe following suggestions made above will make the example correct, less error\\-prone as\\-is not to mention if modified, easier to read/understand its usage and behavior, well\\-tested.\n\n* Removing the area result\\-caching from the rect: dict parameter gets rid of calculation/state error. Replacing it with the standard library's @functools.lru\\_cache decorator has none of the drawbacks and virtually all of the benefits. The performance savings is still there. A function should do one thing, and do it well. Callers could store the value returned by the lru\\_cache memoized area function in an object if desired. In fact, an object could store it in an instance variable. It could even do so in a property read by a getter, fulfilling the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle. So nothing good is being lost or precluded by extracting the memoization, making it an extrinsic quality. Separation of concerns is key to designing good, reusable, reliable, testable functions.\n* For generic handling, like record\\-processing, a dict (or tuple/obj) makes sense. For something like this, explicit/discrete parameters are more easily understood/tested because they're self\\-documenting. The new type annotation syntax is simple \\& efficient for authors to read/change anytime, and tools to verify when developers feel like it.\n* Docstring with doctest compatible examples and unittest test cases will make sure the function works, and stays working.\n* Writing @precondition and @postcondition decorators is easy to do and can make the code more readable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following combinations of Python features and libraries would best address the need for declaring and validating constraints on Python objects, while also providing memoization and clear documentation?\n\nA) PyDBC for constraints, manual caching for memoization, and inline comments for documentation\nB) Type annotations with MyPy, @functools.lru_cache for memoization, and doctest for documentation and testing\nC) PyContracts for constraints, a custom caching dictionary for memoization, and unittest for testing\nD) Custom @precondition and @postcondition decorators, manual result caching, and extensive docstrings\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B provides the most comprehensive and modern approach to addressing the needs outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. Type annotations with MyPy offer static type checking, which can help catch errors early and provide better code documentation.\n2. @functools.lru_cache is a built-in Python decorator that provides efficient memoization without modifying the function's core logic.\n3. doctest allows for inline documentation that doubles as executable tests, ensuring the code examples remain up-to-date and functional.\n\nThis combination leverages Python 3's features and standard library tools, making it more maintainable and less error-prone than the other options.

I've learned that a function of 2 variables is really a 2 dimensional object and we can view and perceive it as 3D by looking at it in 3 space. A function of 3 variables is a 3 dimensional object but we cannot perceive this because it would require us to view it in 4 dimensions, but we can view special cases by drawing level surfaces.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The real question is how you view the space. You must separate these ideas as you think about the question of what a **space** is:\n\n* parametric viewpoint: $t \\\\rightarrow (x(t),y(t))$ is a curve. For each value of $t$ we obtain a point on the curve $C$.\n* implicit viewpoint: $F(x,y)\\=k$. The curve is the set of all $(x,y)$ which solve the equation $F(x,y)\\=k$.\n\nLet me give a specific example, $t \\\\mapsto (\\\\cos t, \\\\sin t)$ parametrizes a circle $C$. On the other hand, the circle could be viewed as the solution set of $F(x,y)\\=x^2\\+y^2\\=1$. The solution set viewpoint involves a single function of two variables $x,y$ whereas the parametric viewpoint requires two functions of a single variable $t$. Each viewpoint has its merits and you must learn to converse in both.\n\nMoving on to the question of a surface in three dimensions. We again have two viewpoints:\n\n* parametric: describe $S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ by $(u,v) \\\\mapsto X(u,v) \\= (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))$. Here three functions of the two parameters $u,v$ describe $S$.\n* implicit: describe $S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ as the solution set of $F(x,y,z) \\= k$. Here one function of three variables describes $S$.\n\nAdvantage of the parametric viewpoint, tangents to $S$ are really easy to find. Advantage of the implicit viewpoint, normals to $S$ are really easy to find.\n\nNow, we primarily school students in how to understand graphs of the form $y\\=f(x)$. These in my view are a sort of middle ground: it is easy to describe $\\\\text{graph}(f)$ either parametrically or implicitly:\n$$ F(x,y) \\= y\\-f(x)\\=0 \\\\qquad \\\\\\& \\\\qquad x \\\\mapsto (x,f(x))$$\n\nI think of it this way:\n\n* parametrically, the dimension of the space is the number of parameters. It doesn't matter if you're mapping into $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\\\\mathbb{R}^{42}$ or a more abstract space.\n* implicitly, the dimension of the object described depends on the number of independent constraints placed on the ambient context. If you're studying an object in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ and you have two equations then that leaves a one dimensional object (for example, the symmetric equations for a line). Or, for a level surface, you have one condition in three variables hence two\\-dimensions remain.\n\nBoth of these comments assume certain technical details, but this is roughly it."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a function F(x,y,z) = k, where k is a constant.

When we add another independent constraint G(x,y,z) = c, we're effectively intersecting two surfaces, which typically results in a 1D curve in 3D space.\n\nThis curve can be parametrically described by t \u2192 (x(t), y(t), z(t)), where t is a single parameter. This aligns with the parametric viewpoint explained in the documentation, where the dimension of the space is determined by the number of parameters (in this case, one).\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they describe objects with too many dimensions given the two constraints. Option C is incorrect because two equations are generally not enough to constrain the solution to a single point in 3D space (though this could happen in special cases where the surfaces are tangent)."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/03", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/107338", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/23240/"], "docs_id": 107338, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Channelwood in Myst a particular lever doesn't appear to be working.

Also, I'm going to assume the fasteners will be more than 7 times their diameter so they won't split the wood. \n\n3\\) Diameter: Because the fastener needs to fit within the stud WIDTH, the diameter is limited to the minimum edge distance of 4 times the diameter...and that assumes you'll be equal distance from each edge of the stud. \n\n4\\) Depth: Assuming a minimum of about 1 1/2\" into wood, the screw needs to be about 2 1/2\" long to account for the 1/2\" drywall plus thickness of the metal hanger. \n\n5\\) Screw or Bolt: You said screw so I'll use screw. \n\n6\\) Loading: Fastening into stud will be side grain (not end grain, which is about 75% less). Also, because the TV is hanging on the wall, loading is a combination of shear and withdrawal. \n\nTherefore, I'd use a \\#8 wood screw (0\\.164\" diameter) x 2 1/2\" long (to develop full resistance) which will give you about 95 lbs. withdrawal resistance in close or medium grain \"dry\" lumber per screw. \n\nRemember, you can only \"shave\" a maximum of 1 1/2\" off depth of stud (don't over cut or it will weaken stud) and don't over pre\\-drill diameter of hole. To develop full lateral strength, there needs to be lead holes drilled (pre\\-drilled). Lead holes should be about 7/8th the shank diameter. Therefore, I'd use a 0\\.1435\" diameter bit.

This choice aligns with the recommendations in the documentation for several reasons:\n\n1. The #8 size provides an appropriate diameter for the load and stud width.\n2. The 2.5-inch length allows for proper penetration into the stud (about 1.5 inches) after accounting for drywall thickness and the metal bracket.\n3. This size offers sufficient withdrawal resistance (about 95 lbs per screw) for the 110-pound TV.\n4. Wood screws are specified rather than lag bolts, matching the original recommendation.\n\nOption A is too short and uses a smaller diameter screw, which wouldn't provide adequate strength.

This is suggested by the fact that the MX records point to a different IP address than the one used for SMTP.

The simplest way would be to have a secondary table that would hold the user id and the timestamp of when the user was last processed, and limit your cron script to loop through, for example, 500 users per time. The exact numbers will depend on what exactly you are doing, it'll be a bit of a trial and error.\n\nIf you do decide to batch the process, you'll obviously need to run the cron script more than once, that's easy enough, only process users that weren't recently processed (by checking the timestamp) and, of course, logging them as processed afterwards. If your user ids are sequential, you could save yourself the trouble of logging each processed user id and just log the last one of the batch, however if something goes wrong in the middle of the batch, you wouldn't have any idea of where it stopped. Your choice ;)\n\nNext you need to optimize the hell out of your loop. Start with the simple stuff, are you using for or foreach? There's an abundance of references claiming one being faster than the other, but the truth is you'll have to test them and find out which one is faster (if there's actually a difference) for you. Depends on your php version, os, and the structures you're looping (if you are looping iterable objects, for example), and obviously you should run your test on the server where your script will live, especially if the environment is different from your local development one.\n\nThen, it's time to profile and optimize your calculations. You aren't telling us what you are doing, but 3\\.5mb of memory sounds a bit much for a single iteration. It could be that your calculations are so intensive and you've done your best, or there might be something obvious you're missing, in any case that's something only a profiler can tell you. \n\nAlthough `max_execution_time` is hardcoded to 0 (no limit) for the CLI SAPI, you might want to limit the execution time through [set\\_time\\_limit](http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php) or [ini\\_set('max\\_execution\\_time')](http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php) (same thing) for two reasons:\n\n1. It will help testing the script via the browser, where there is a limit (in php.ini). It wouldn't be advisable to allow browser access to the production script, but during development it wouldn't make sense to setup cron just to test your script.\n2. Although there's no limit for CLI scripts, it wouldn't hurt to impose the limit just in case something awry happens. Database servers do hiccup once in a while, and you don't really want your script to run ad infinitum (\\=\\= until it runs out of memory).\n\nIf you are having memory problems, then it's time to do some [garbage collecting](http://us.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.php). The naive approach would be to call [gc\\_collect\\_cycles](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.gc-collect-cycles.php) at the end of your script, forcing the garbage collection of any existing cycles at that time. It wouldn't hurt if you've [unset()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php) any memory hungry resources before hand. Remember that php loops don't create their own scope, for example: \n\n```\n<?php\n\nforeach($array as $key => $value) {\n   doSomething($value);\n}\n\nvar_dump($key, $value);\n\n?>\n\n```\n\nwill work, dumping the last `$key` and `$value` of the loop, which means that at the end of the loop you don't have one (`$array`) but three unused variables, that will be collected when php decides it's a good time to collect garbage. To force it, do something like:\n\n```\n<?php\n\nforeach($array as $key => $value) {\n   doSomething($value);\n}\n\nunset($array, $key, $value);\ngc_collect_cycles();\n\n?>\n\n```\n\nI'm 99% certain that `unset($array, $key, $value);` is unnecessary here, however it's a favourite hack of the \\< php 5\\.3 days, and I'm sticking with it (at least until I fully understand how garbage collection works in php ;).\n\nFor anything more than that, you really need to give us the specifics of your calculations, and show us your code."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating a nightly cron job to perform calculations on a growing user table with about 3000 records.

When white light shines on this mixture, which of the following best explains the resulting color perception and why?\n\nA) The mixture will appear green because cyan pigments reflect blue and green light while yellow pigments reflect green and red light, resulting in only green light being reflected.\n\nB) The mixture will appear dark blue because cyan pigments absorb red light and yellow pigments absorb blue light, leaving only blue light to be reflected.\n\nC) The mixture will appear bright yellow-green because the complementary absorption of the two pigments enhances the reflection of yellow and green wavelengths.\n\nD) The mixture will appear as a less bright green compared to pure green paint because both pigments partially absorb some green light, reducing the overall reflected light intensity.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: When cyan and yellow paints are mixed, both sets of pigments are working simultaneously to absorb certain wavelengths of light. Cyan pigments primarily absorb red light while reflecting blue and green. Yellow pigments absorb blue light while reflecting green and red. In the mixture, blue light is absorbed by the yellow pigments, red light is absorbed by the cyan pigments, and green light is partially reflected by both. However, since each pigment is also partially absorbing some green light, the resulting color appears as a less bright green compared to a pure green paint. This aligns with the principle mentioned in the original text that mixing paints results in less overall light reflection and thus a less bright appearance. The other options are incorrect because they either misinterpret the absorption/reflection properties of the pigments or fail to account for the reduced brightness effect of mixing paints."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/13", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/3575", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1531/"], "docs_id": 3575, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've got a data table like:\n\n```\nID  Low Color    Med Color     High Color\n 1        234          123            324\n 2          4          432           3423\n\n```\n\nThe rows are widgets, the columns are color levels.

They reduce solar gain by blocking direct sunlight before it enters the apartment, while still allowing for airflow. This helps keep the interior cooler without completely blocking ventilation.\nD) Evaporative coolers are not effective in humid climates like Mumbai, as mentioned in the passage for areas with high humidity.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the expert advice given in the documentation, which states that \"outside louvers over the windows would be better than curtains inside\" and explains that louvers \"would reduce solar gain while still allowing airflow into the room.\""}}
