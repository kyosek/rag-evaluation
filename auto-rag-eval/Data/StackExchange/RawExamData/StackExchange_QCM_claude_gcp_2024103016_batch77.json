They are not equivalent by any means, but have some important similarities. When you estimate a posterior mode, you're doing Bayesian \"maximum likelihood\". \n\nThe posterior mode is not often preferred because the sampling distribution of this value can be very irregular. That's for two reasons: the posterior may have many local maximae and mode estimation is very inefficient except when making strong assumptions. These points are moot when doing exact Bayes, in which case the posterior is known to fall into a parametric family. But doing Gibbs Sampling all higgeldy piggeldy will not guarantee that the posterior falls into any \"known\" family of distributions.\n\nIn basic probability problems, it's easy to obtain exact expressions for posteriors when there are constraining assumptions made about the distribution of sample data and the specification of the prior. In practice, this is rarely the case and posteriors in finite (small) samples can be bumpy, ugly things. \n\nThe sampling distribution of the posterior mode *does have* some convergence properties, like any estimator. But none so well understood and explored as those of the posterior mean. It's so often the efficient estimator in frequentist problems, little wonder it is preferred in the Bayesian world as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Bayesian statistics, which of the following statements is true regarding the posterior mode compared to the posterior mean?\n\nA) The posterior mode always provides a more efficient estimate than the posterior mean.\nB) The posterior mode has a more regular sampling distribution than the posterior mean.\nC) The posterior mode is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in frequentist statistics.\nD) The posterior mode can have a very irregular sampling distribution, especially with complex posteriors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the posterior mode is often less efficient than the posterior mean, especially when making fewer assumptions about the distribution.\nB is incorrect as the posterior mode typically has a less regular sampling distribution compared to the posterior mean.\nC is not entirely accurate. While the posterior mode is sometimes called Bayesian \"maximum likelihood\", it's not exactly equivalent to frequentist maximum likelihood estimation.\nD is correct.

For a electrically charged sphere the charges are accumulated on the surface, leading to the situation where the field is effectively zero everywhere within that sphere. Mathematically a Dyson sphere is equivalent to that. Of course, the field within the Dyson sphere wouldn't be zero because of the sun, but the contribution from the Dyson sphere sphere structure itself *could* be zero. I say \"could\" because this assumes the matter is perfectly distributed.\n\nSuch a system is neither stable or unstable. It's just balanced.\n\n> its origin\n\nIf the perfect symmetry is satisfied (and the neighborhood is clear, more on that later), the location of the star within the sphere is irrelevant to its stability actually. The system would be just as stable with the star close to the edge as it would be exactly at the Dyson sphere's center.\n\nIf the matter was anything less than perfectly spherical it would be categorically unstable, not just balanced. I believe this is the same sort of consequence as Earnshaw's theorem. Any arrangement of matter won't create an inherently stable point in empty space where the field's divergence is zero.\n\nFor purposes of science fiction, I would say the answer is \"yes\", active stabilization of some form would be needed. Even if you assume perfect symmetry, there are ways other objects in the solar system would cause the sphere and the star to crash into each other in the absence of active controls. I will have to break this down into two cases:\n\nFactors apply even if the sun is at the origin:\n\n* the radiation in our part of the galaxy isn't isotropic, so it would push the sphere to hit the star eventually\n* gravitational waves can act non\\-uniformly, and this can lead to other modes of instability (next list) to drive them to hit eventually\n\nFactors that apply if the sun it slightly displaced from the origin:\n\n* if the sun wasn't dead center, tidal forces from other astronomical bodies would accelerate it toward the side\n* if the Dyson Sphere was non\\-uniform and the sun was not at the CM, it would be accelerating, and that would be unstable acceleration\n\nHowever, if we are assuming an advanced civilization built the Dyson sphere, it shouldn't be a difficult task to use controlled reflected radiation from the sun itself to keep it in the center.

These factors include non-isotropic radiation in the galaxy, gravitational waves, tidal forces from other astronomical bodies, and potential non-uniformities in the sphere's construction.

When cyan and yellow paints are mixed, both sets of pigments are present and competing to absorb and reflect light. Cyan pigments primarily absorb red light and reflect blue and green, while yellow pigments absorb blue light and reflect green and red. In the mixture, green is the main color that both pigments reflect, which is why the resulting color is green. However, the mixture appears less vibrant than either pure cyan or yellow for two reasons:\n\n1. The yellow pigments absorb some of the blue light that cyan would normally reflect, and the cyan pigments absorb some of the red light that yellow would normally reflect.\n2.

Your data is noisy, since you have many different products and there are many factors that you are not able to account.

The linear model's simplicity and robustness make it a strong choice for this particular business scenario."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/12", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/152571", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/16275/"], "docs_id": 152571, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Researching distributed source control management (specifically mercurial).\nMy question is more or less **what is the best practice for rejecting entire sets of code that fail testing?**\n\n**Example:**\n\nA team is working on a hello world program. They have testers and a scheduled release coming up with specific features planned. \n\n```\nUpcoming Release:\n   Add feature A\n   Add feature B\n   Add feature C\n\n```\n\nSo, the developers make their clones for their features, do the work and merge them into a QA repo for the testers to scrutinize. \n\nLet's say the testers report back that \"Feature B is incomplete and in fact dangerous\", and they would like to retest A and C.\n\n![Repo Doodle](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DteiT.png)\n\n**End example.**\n\nWhat's the best way to do all this so that feature B can easily be removed and you end up with a new repo that contains only feature A and C merged together?\n\nRecreate the test repo? Back out B? Other magic?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key here is to come up with a workflow that avoids the situation where \"bad\" code is ever exposed to developers or teams other than those who created it. If this were to occur, good code would be mixed with bad, and \"unmerging\" or detangling them will be difficult. So, prevent this from happening in the first place.\n\nI'm assuming that HelloWorld in this example is the mainline repository, that contains known good code. Developers A, B, and C all clone from this repo and develop their changes against it. In the model I'm describing, HelloWorld\\-test is a transient repo solely used by QA to test merged changes before moving them into the mainline. Developers never look at HelloWorld\\-test. Here's how it works.\n\n* A, B, and C all clone good code from mainline (HelloWorld).\n* A makes changes and tells QA she's ready (or A pushes her changes to a staging repo). QA clones mainline and pulls and merges A's changes, and then builds and tests. Assuming this is all successful, QA then merges these changes into the mainline.\n* B now makes his changes available. QA clones mainline and then pulls and merges B's changes into HelloWorld\\-test. Continuing with your example, let's say these changes are bad. So QA's merge fails, or the build fails, or the tests fail, or something. At this point QA declares the changes to be bad, notifies B, and simply throws away HelloWorld\\-test. It's now B's responsibility to pull and merge from mainline, fix test failures, or whatever.\n* QA can then perform the process with C, starting from a fresh clone of mainline, and merging in C's changes. Note that B's bad changes have never reached the mainline and so C's changes (or anybody else's) will never be mixed with them.\n* At some point B has fixed up his changes and asks QA to do another pull/merge/build/test. QA can do this next, or they can just go around the cycle of different developers or teams until they come back to B.\n\nThis is often called a \"pull model\" of development. I believe Linux kernel changes are managed this way.\n\nIn many cases it's not \"QA\" who does the pull/merge/build/test cycle, but instead it's done by a continuous integration system such as Hudson or Jenkins.\n\nOf course, there are many variations of this, whether individual developers or teams have staging repos, whether changes are propagated via pushing or pulling, etc. But they should all share these key characteristics:\n\n1. Only known good changes make it into the mainline.\n2. Developers only pull/clone from mainline, thus they never base their work on bad changes.\n3. New changes are merged, built, and tested in isolation from everything else and are verified good before being merged into the mainline."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a distributed version control system like Mercurial, what is the best practice for managing code changes and avoiding the integration of faulty code into the main repository?\n\nA) Merge all feature branches directly into the main repository and let QA sort out issues later\nB) Have developers push their changes to a shared testing repository where all features are combined before QA testing\nC) Use a pull model where QA tests each feature in isolation by creating temporary test repositories, only merging approved changes into the main repository\nD) Allow developers to freely pull from each other's repositories to speed up development, then have QA test the final combined result\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This approach, known as the \"pull model,\" ensures that only verified, good code reaches the main repository. QA creates temporary test repositories for each feature, merging changes from individual developers. If a feature passes testing, it's merged into the main repository. If it fails, the test repository is discarded without affecting the main codebase or other developers' work. This method prevents bad code from being exposed to other developers, avoids mixing good and bad code, and maintains the integrity of the main repository. Options A and B risk introducing faulty code into shared repositories, while D can lead to propagation of errors across multiple developers' work."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89518", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/12489/"], "docs_id": 89518, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The proof that $\\\\Gamma(z)\\\\pm \\\\Gamma(1\\-z)$ only has zeros for $z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ or $z\\= \\\\frac12 \\+i \\\\mathbb{R}$ has been given here:\n\n[Are all zeros of $\\\\Gamma(s) \\\\pm \\\\Gamma(1\\-s)$ on a line with real part \\= $\\\\frac12$ ?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89324/are-all-zeros-of-gammas-pm-gamma1-s-on-a-line-with-real-part-frac12)\n\nAn obvious follow up question is whether $\\\\zeta(s) \\\\pm \\\\zeta(1\\-s)$ also has zeros (other than its non\\-trivial ones that would induce 0\\+0 or 0\\-0\\). \n\nThis is indeed the case and $\\\\zeta(s)^2 \\- \\\\zeta(1\\-s)^2$ has the following zeros:\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 0\\.819545329 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 3\\.436218226 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 9\\.666908056 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 14\\.13472514 i$ (the first non trivial)\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 14\\.51791963 i$\n\n$\\\\frac12 \\\\pm 17\\.84559954 i$\n\n$\\\\dots$\n\nThese 'semi' trivial zeros appear to all lie on the critical line.

I would expect that the exact same techniques work here, i.e. one can show by known estimates for the gamma function that all nonreal solutions of the displayed equation lie on $\\\\Re s\\=1/2$.\n\n**EDIT 1\\.** To keep up with new developments I now expect that within the critical strip all nonreal solutions of the displayed equation lie on $\\\\Re s\\=1/2$. Moreover, it seems reasonable to believe that there are no nonreal solutions with $\\|\\\\Re s\\|$ sufficiently large.\n\n**EDIT 2\\.** It follows from a generalized Rouch\u00e9's theorem and Stirling's approximation that there are no nonreal solutions with $\\|\\\\Re s\\|$ sufficiently large. More precisely, consider the rectangular contour $C\\_n$ with vertices $2n\\\\pm it$ and $2n\\+2\\\\pm it$, where $n\\>0$ is a large integer and $t\\>0$ is sufficiently large in terms of $n$. It suffices to show that along $C\\_n$ we have \n$$ \\\\left\\|\\\\pi^{\\-\\\\frac{1\\-s}{2}}\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{1\\-s}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right\\|\\<\\\\left\\|\\\\pi^{\\-\\\\frac{s}{2}}\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{s}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right\\|,$$\nbecause this implies that inside $C\\_n$ there is precisely one solution of the above displayed equation (which must be real by the reflection principle).

quantity of items in their cart beyond 1, even though sufficient stock is available. What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The product is out of stock in the admin panel\nB) The custom extension's observer is limiting the quantity update\nC) The cart update AJAX call is failing\nD) The product has a maximum quantity limit set\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. The question states that \"required number of quantity is available in backend\", so stock availability is not the issue.\n\nB) Correct. The problem occurs only when the custom extension is installed, and the error message comes from the extension. The observer.php file contains logic in the cartUpdate() method that checks quantities and can limit updates, likely causing this behavior.\n\nC) Incorrect. While an AJAX failure could cause update issues, it's unlikely to specifically limit quantities to 1, and the error message suggests the request is reaching the server.\n\nD) Incorrect. A maximum quantity limit could cause similar symptoms, but it would likely be consistent with or without the extension installed. The problem only occurs with the extension active.\n\nThe correct answer is B because the custom extension's observer is the most likely culprit, given that the issue only occurs when the extension is active and the error message originates from the extension."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/10/19", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/228054", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/103533/"], "docs_id": 228054, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am writing a personal statement for university application.

Your sentence has other flaws \\- if this is your personal statement for university admission, you need to fix them. In this kind of situations, it is better to be bulletproof in your writing.\n\n> My experience \\[in/of/with] **internship**, **work** and **social activities relating to business** allowed me to became interested in business analytics.\n\nThe sentence is very vague \\- \"experience in ***internship*** and ***work***\"? *Internship* is work too. If it is unpaid, then make that distinction \\- *internship* and *paid work*. \n\nIt is better to say what exactly it is that you have experience \\[in/with] \\- (a) **specialized topic or field** (financial accounting, marketing, taxes, business law, etc.), (b) **tools** (business software, database management, etc.), or (c) **doing something** (managing and organizing events/meetings, consulting clients, making coffee, etc.) \n\nAlso, a better alternative to *\"... and social activities relating to business\"* would be *\"business\\-related social activities\"*. Again, in my opinion, this is a bit vague. What were these business\\-related social activities \\- potlucks? If so, then mention it. Were they advertising campaigns, charity events (CSR?), or awareness programs?\n\nIf you have already mentioned these in detail in previous paragraphs, then you don't really need to say \"internship, work and social activities relating to business\" \\- you can just say \"my professional experiences allowed me ...\"\n\n---\n\nA. **Preposition: in** \n\nWhen we refer to a specialized sector, area, topic, or field of knowledge, we generally use \"in\"\n\n> Their experience in marketing and promotion has brought excellent results (Cambridge).\n> \n> \n> She has ten years\u2019 experience in television and radio.

(usually followed by the \\-ing form of a verb)(Cambridge).\n\n---\n\nThe use of the prepositions is not enforced strictly, I think. We mix it up often when we speak. Then there is the matter of how they may vary between AmE and BrE. There is a comment by JavaLatte in Yuri's post: *\"According to NGram, there is a significant difference in usage of \"have experience X\" where X is a preposition, between BrE (of \\>\\> in \\> with) and Ame (in \\> with \\>\\> of).\"* \n\nAll three \\- \"in\", \"of\", or \"with\" \\- can be used with \"experience\".

(That is, do not have topologies which are final with respect to all maps with compact Hausdorff domains. i.e. do not belong to the monocoreflective hull of the class of compact *Hausdorff* spaces as computed in $Top$.)\n\nThe construction of such a space is due to J. Isbell, *[A Distinguishing Example in k\\-Spaces](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1987-100-03/S0002-9939-1987-0891170-3/)*, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. **100** (1987\\), 593\\-594\\. Below is my attempt at his details.\n\nLet $X\\=\\\\omega\\_1\\+1$, where $\\\\omega\\_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, and topologise $X$ by giving it the base of *closed* sets generated by $(i)$ countable initial segments $\\[0,\\\\alpha]$, and $(ii)$ the singleton $\\\\{\\\\omega\\\\}$. The space $X$ is our counterexample.\n\n> $X$ is locally compact.\n\n*Proof*: Indeed, more is true: every subspace of $A\\\\subseteq X$ is compact. For $A$, if nonempty, contains a least element, every neighbourhood of which contains all of $A$ except for possibly $\\\\omega\\_1$. $\\\\square$\n\n> $X$ is not compactly generated.\n\nProof: The claim is that there is a non\\-closed subspace $A\\\\subseteq X$ with the property that whenever $f:K\\\\rightarrow X$ is a continuous function with $K$ a compact Hausdorff space, the preimage $f^{\\-1}(A)$ is a closed subset of $K$. We will show that the open subspace $A\\=\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ has this property.\n\nSo take $K$ and $f$ as above and suppose $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega)\\\\subset K$ is not closed. Fix a countable ordinal $\\\\alpha\\_1$ and consider the closed set $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq K$. This is disjoint from the closed set $K\\\\setminus f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$, so by normality of $K$ there are disjoint open sets $U\\_1,V\\_1\\\\subset K$ with $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq U\\_1\\\\subseteq X\\\\setminus V\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$. Because we are assuming that $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is not closed we have $X\\\\setminus V\\_1\\\\neq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha)$, so in particular the inclusion $U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is proper. Thus there is a countable $\\\\alpha\\_2\\>\\\\alpha\\_1$ for which there is a proper inclusion $U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_2]$.\n\nNow iterate the process to obtain a sequence of proper inclusions\n$$f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_2]\\\\subseteq U\\_2\\\\subseteq\\\\dots$$\nSince $\\\\bigcup\\_\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\alpha\\_i$ is countable, $\\\\bigcup f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_i]\\=f^{\\-1}(\\\\bigcup \\[0,\\\\alpha\\_i])$ is closed in $K$ and hence compact. On the other hand it is covered by the $U\\_i$, but by no finite subfamily of them. Thus there is a contradiction. It must be that $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is closed in $K$. $\\\\square$\n\n*Remark*: $(i)$ All that was needed of $K$ was its compactness and normality.

Steam is installed on the HDD and I'm on Windows 7 64\\-bit system. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this but how TWW's patching work is that it needs to allocate the entire space of the game so that it can open each file and rewrite the code.\n\nThe issue is that each time TWW needs to patch itself it tries to allocate additional 34GB which I don't have on the SSD.

You can still use these strategies when playing in normal mode, it's just that it's not as essential since it is a lot easier to survive since you may gain hearts still and you don't take extra damage.\n\nPreparation:\n------------\n\nBefore you consider trying to take on this challenge, make sure the items you can take with you are upgraded to their strongest versions. You want to be able to finish this as quickly as possible and having the strongest weapons will help with that. So you should have the complete **Master Sword** with you, (at a minimum) the **Goddess Shield** (the **Sacred Shield** upgraded twice) and the **Sacred Bow** (the **Bow** upgraded twice). It will also help if you come in with the maximum bombs and arrows, that way you won't be searching for them when you need it.\n\nAlthough you can't use items during the challenge, you can use them just before. So certain items that give buffs over time can still have their effect as you enter the challenge. For maximum effectiveness, you should bring with you the **Guardian Potion\\+** (the **Guardian Potion** infused once) with the **Potion Medal**. Just before you start the challenge, drink the **Guardian Potion\\+** that way you'll have *nine minutes* of invulnerability. This will give you enough time to save your hearts for the most difficult bosses in the beginning of the challenge. Optionally, you can also take a **Stamina Potion\\+** (the **Stamina Potion** infused once) too but you really won't need it.\n\nThe first boss you choose should be the most difficult boss available that way you make good use of the **Guardian Potion\\+** if you're expecting to take a lot of hits:\n\nWhen playing the normal mode, I personally found that **Koloktos** was probably the most difficult of the bosses to not get hurt in. Some of its attacks are just hard to anticipate and prepare for since it has a lot of range and you have to be close for them to come out. Unless you don't mind a long battle waiting for the right attacks to come out, I would recommend doing this one first. Otherwise, it's your choice here. Keep in mind that if you come in using the **Guardian Potion\\+**, you don't want to waste too much time.\n\nWhen playing in **Hero Mode**, I would strongly suggest you do the **Horde Battle** first (no exceptions). This is probably the most time consuming battles you'll have to go through and so many ways to get hit. They aren't the hardest enemies in the game but there's so many of them and it is easy to get surrounded.\n\nGeneral Strategy:\n-----------------\n\nYour primary concern for this challenge above all else is to survive taking as little damage as possible. This might not be too much of a problem when playing in normal mode since you can still find hearts in certain places but it is absolutely essential when you're playing in **Hero Mode**.\n\nYour shield is your lifeline here, use it. If you're not planning on attacking an enemy, you generally should have your shield out at all times by shaking the **Nunchuk**. That way you can't get caught off guard and take a hit when you're not paying attention. If you see the attack coming, perform a **Shield Bash** just before it connects. Your shield won't take damage and it will usually leave the enemy stunned for a second so you can counter.\n\nIf your **Sacred Shield** is getting low on durability, stay away from the enemies and their attacks until your shield fully repairs itself. The last thing you want to have happen is to have your shield be destroyed. Of course if you already have the **Hylian Shield**, you won't have to worry about this.\n\nThe Beginning:\n--------------\n\n* **Ghirahim**  \n\nFor the first part of the battle, he will hold out one hand to try to grab your sword. If you swing your sword right into his hand, he will grab it. To get him to release it, just flick the Wiimote up. Hitting him can be pretty easy. Just hold out your sword in a direction (e.g., to the right, the left, upper\\-right, etc.) so he will point his hand in that direction. When he does, flick the Wiimote in that direction again so your sword swing will come from the opposite direction. Repeat until the next part of the battle.\n\nAt this point, he'll pull out a sword to finally fight now. He has a couple of different attacks here. He will summon darts and shoot them at you. These are easily avoided but could also be knocked back at him. They don't seem to affect him though. He will also teleport around the room every once in a while, some times right next to you. When he does this, be sure to welcome him with a **Spin Attack**. This will stun him so you can follow up with more hits. He will also charge in at you and swing with his sword. You can pull a **Spin Attack** here to hit him when he's close enough. The only catch is that the spin has to be right into him. If he charges in at you to your left, you need to perform a **Spin Attack** spinning to the right. Otherwise, you can **Shield Bash** at the right time and counter. Repeat until he's dead.\n* **Scaldera**  \n\nYou'll need to get your bombs ready for this battle. When **Scaldera** is glowing orange with lava, he is invulnerable to your attacks will try to attack you. You need to wait for him to stop glowing. Just run up the ramp until he stops. When he does, turn around and throw a bomb at him. It will knock him back down the ramp, follow him. When he recovers, he will breathe in to blow some fireballs at you. As he does this, throw a bomb at him so he will eat it. This will stun him allowing you to attack his eye. Repeat this until he is dead.\n\nAt some point after you have hit him enough times, he will run up the ramp high off the ground. When he does this, just let him run above you up the ramp. He can't hurt you. He will roll down the hill once he reaches the top but you should be able to easily dodge him. When he reaches the bottom, he will breathe in for the fireballs, you know what to do then.\n* **Moldarach**  \n\nThere's not much strategy in fighting this guy, just wait until he exposes the blue eyes in his claws and attack it in the right direction. If the claw eyes turn red, either dodge back or **Shield Bash** and counter. Same thing if he's about to attack with the tail.\n\nThe next phase in the battle, he'll burrow underground. Just pull out the **Gust Bellows** and blow away the sand until he's exposed and jumps out. When he's out, stab him in the eye. Just be careful when me tries to move away from you, he will almost always do a charge attack or use his tail on you. You can dodge this or **Shield Bash** and counter. Do this until he's dead.\n* **The Imprisoned**  \n\nThis battle should be relatively easy. The goal is to jam the spike in his head three times to defeat him. There's two ways to do this. The safest way would be to jump up on top of its head using the higher ledges and hit it down from there. Otherwise you could cut its toes off from both its feet to knock it down. With it down, you could run up to the head and drive the spike up into its head. Just be careful that if you cut any of its toes off, it will start to stomp sending shockwaves that could hurt you. If you manage to cut off all the toes on a foot, it will not do this. After the first time you drive the spike in, it will always send shockwaves at its feet so it would be safer to finish him off by jumping on its head.\n\nThe Middle:\n-----------\n\n* **Koloktos**  \n\nMake sure your **Whip** is equipped. You'll want to draw his attacks so he gets his arms stuck in the ground. He'll only do these attacks if you are close enough to him or after a certain amount of time passes. If you're too far too often, he will throw his axes at you. If too close, he will swipe at you with his axes. When the arms are stuck, use your whip on the stuck arms to break them apart. Do this until all arms are destroyed giving you access to its crystal heart.\n\nDamage the heart enough times will bring phase two of the battle. This time its not stationary and stuck in the middle of the room, it will pull itself out exposing its legs and can move around. This is the more dangerous phase since it has more attacks and is mobile. It will even summon a couple of **Cursed Bokoblins** to get in your way. They are mostly harmless but kill them off when they get too close.\n\nAgain, the goal is to get its arms stuck in the ground so you can pull them apart. It will swing with its left or right set of arms at you at a time or even both. When it's swinging down with one set, dodge back and pull its arms apart. It will drop the swords to the ground where you can pick one up and use as a weapon. After picking one up, wait until it attacks before moving in, you are much more slower this way and can't really block. Move close enough so it is in range of your sword swings and do a horizontal swing at its legs. Doing so will chop its legs off leaving it helpless. You can then wail away at the body to break open the shell and the crystal heart. Repeat the process until it is defeated.\n* **Tentalus**  \n\nThe first thing you want to do is pull out your sword and charge for a **Skyward Strike**. Tentacles will soon bust out from the deck and these are your targets. Lop off four of them using your **Skyward Strikes** and **Tentalus** will come up out of the water to fight you. Just don't do vertical **Skyward Strikes** as it will not cut them off. Always keep moving so they can't get a hold of you.\n\nWhen he comes out of the water, get your **Sacred Bow** ready. You'll need to shoot him in the eye to be able to stun him. To be as quick as possible, use the `C` button and shake the **Nunchuk** to pull back your bow then release `C` to fire. You can shoot arrows off rapidly this way. Try to hit the eye when it is first opened. When you hit him, rush up to him so you can get close and personal with his eye. Just keep doing vertical **Spin Attacks** as much as you can until he moves away (it will be short enough that you won't tire yourself). If his tentacle hair gets in the way, charge up a **Skyward Strike** to cut them out of the way. Repeat until the next phase in the battle.\n\nYou'll know you're switching over to the next phase of the battle when he hits the deck and barrels start rolling toward you. Run toward the box that dropped down and climb up. Make sure you avoid the barrels.\n\nThis phase is mostly the same as the first phase, except this time, his tentacle hair will sprout mouths and start attacking you. Until he's stunned, you need to fight off the tentacle mouths. Just keep swinging your sword horizontally until they stop attacking. Quickly pull out your bow and hit the eye. Like before, rush up to him and hack at his eye. Repeat until he's dead.\n* **Ghirahim**  \n\nThis battle will start off pretty much the same as your last encounter with him except this time he will have darts with him to slow you down. You can negate his use of the darts if you charge for a **Skyward Strike**. Just charge then swing away in the right direction.\n\nThis time around, he will pull out two swords and have three times as many darts than he did before. Use pretty much the same strategies here again. When you're close enough to him, he will hold out his swords to block your attacks from certain directions. Just swing in the direction he's not blocking and you can easily hit him multiple times. Some times he will jump up into the air and try to land on you with a downward stab. When he does this, just dodge back and counter when he hits the ground. He will also summon darts surrounding you or in some configuration. Just do an attack that could hit them all at once. If they form a circle around you parallel to the ground, just to a horizontal **Spin Attack**. Just keep hitting him until he's defeated.\n* **The Imprisoned**  \n\nAnother fight with **The Imprisoned** but this time he has arms. I would advise against attacking it's toes this time, the shockwaves it produces when it steps are too frequent to avoid and is easy to get hurt this time. This time, I would suggest jumping onto its head always and drive the spike in from there.\n\nAt some point he will try to climb up the walls. You have two options, the easiest would be to switch to **Groose** and shoot at its hands to knock it down. Otherwise you could go to town on its fingers to knock it down. Once knocked down, just repeat the process above until he's defeated.\n\nLater On:\n---------\n\n* **The Imprisoned**  \n\nIn this battle, things get a little complicated. This time around, he grew a tail and can fly later on. Again, I still find it safest to go straight for his head however he will always shake you off. Before you go on to jump onto his head, switch to **Groose** to hurl a bomb at him. That should stun him long enough for you to be able to jump on his head to drive the spike down.\n\nDoing this, the imprisoned will start to fly. Not a problem though, fortunately **Groose** will have a bomb ready. Shoot him down. It will knock him into the ground in the center. Get down there and knock the spike into his head.\n\nHe will start to fly again but **Groose's** supply of bombs will be blocked making it unusable. fortunately you still have a perfectly working catapult. Climb up to the top and ride that catapult by shooting yourself onto the imprisoned's head. Once you get there, drive the spike in his head one more time to finish him off.\n* **Horde Battle**  \n\nI consider this battle mostly just a race than a real battle. Most of the enemies you see here will be Bokoblins (and other variations) and can be killed in a single swing of the sword. You don't want to waste too much time fighting off the endless streams of them, you want to make it to the end as fast as possible.\n\nUntil you are stopped by a wall and forced to fight, you should be sprinting your way down the hill dodging the enemies that get in your way (remember, you can't have your shield out and sprint at the same time). Try to pick up **Stamina Fruits** along the way down to minimize the time you have to walk and recover your stamina.\n\nWhen the time comes to fight, you should take care of the horde first. Don't even go near the \"specialist\" enemies yet until you've dispatched the weaker ones. I find it easy to let them bunch up, run up to the group and do a **Spin Attack** then step away. Let them bunch up again and repeat. Once you've taken care of the \"dumb\" Bokoblins, you can go after specialists. Just use your instincts here, there's nothing special about these enemies than what you have already encountered. There is a blue Bokoblin that can take an unusual amount of punishment but that's about it.\n\nThere will be five phases to this battle each corresponding to when you are forced to stop and fight. The first phase will spawn a bunch of the smarter Bokoblins (the ones that can block your attacks). The second phase you will have to fight three **Wooden Shield Moblins**. The third phase, you will have to fight off the blue Bokoblin. The fourth phase, you will have to fight off two **Stalfos**. The fifth and final stage, you'll just have to fight off an army of (dumb) Bokoblins at the end.\n* **Ghirahim**  \n\nThis battle is about patience. Just about all the attacks he has are counters or *must* be countered. You're not going to win this battle by blindly flailing around your sword.\n\nThe first phase of the battle should be simple. The goal is to knock him down off the platforms so you can perform a **Finishing Move** on his weak point, the diamond in his chest. In order to do that, just wail away at him until you knock him over the edge. Every once in a while, he will attack you. He will always make an audible noise and change stances before he does so. When you see him do this, dodge back or pull out your shield. After he swings, just continue swinging away.\n\nAfter you knock him down the first time and he gets close to the edge, he will start to hold out purple flames from his hands. If you hit them, he will counter so you need to not hit them. Take your time here and slow down, there's no rush but don't take too long. Hitting him three times will move on to the second phase of the battle.\n\nTo kill him quickly here, get close enough and try to do straight stabs at him. He will parry your stab and will attempt to counter. When he does, shield bash at the right time to quickly stun him. Once stunned, stab him in the chest. After this, he will jump back and shoot off his own \"skyward strikes\" at you. Just dodge these or knock them back, hitting him will stun him even longer. Just repeat until the last phase in the battle.\n\nIn the last phase of the battle, he will materialize a huge sword to attack you with. The goal is to break his sword so you can hit him in the chest two more times. Here you can take your time a little bit here. If you swing at him or **Shield Bash** his attacks at the right time, he'll hold out his sword to block your attacks. You'll want to hit the sword in the same exact spot four times to expose the crystal inside it to destroy it. If you don't, he will counter and repair his sword.\n\nYou can only swing at it perpendicular to how he's holding it. So if he's holding it vertically, you need to swing at it horizontally. Make sure you swing at it at the side where you last hit it. If you see the broken side on the right, swing at the right. After the sword is destroyed, you can stab him in the chest.\n* **Demise**\n\nThe first phase of the Demise battle is fairly easy. Simply dodge or Shield Bash his attacks, then counter. After most of his attacks you will only be able to get in a single hit, and that is all you should attempt. If you manage to block and counter a full series of four consecutive attacks, he will be stunned, and you can wail on him for a while until he blocks you.\n\nOccasionally during this phase, he will attempt a rapid three\\-hit attack with his sword. He will continue with the second slash even if you block the first; if you're quick enough to notice this and react, hit him between the first two slashes, and he will be instantly stunned.\n\nAfter you hit him enough, the second phase begins with Demise charging his sword with a lightning bolt. At first you must simply concentrate on dodging his Skyward Strike. He may attack normally once or twice, but very soon he will dispel his charge in a bolt. **Do not try to shield bash this bolt**; simply dodge to the side.\n\nAfter he dispels his first bolt, **you are now competing with him for the lightning.** You can only charge your sword when lightning flashes in the background. Demise will attempt to charge his sword, but if your sword is raised at that moment, **you will take priority** and charge yours instead. Raise your sword at every possible moment, except when you need to do a Shield Bash to block Demise.\n\nOnce your sword is charged, take the first opportunity to hit him with your Skyward Strike. He will be stunned, and you can attack him.\n\n**If Demise charges his sword a second time, you are in trouble.** He will take his sweet time in dispelling his bolt from now on. Now, you must concentrate solely on dodging his next bolt, whenever it may come. He may use any number of normal attacks during this time; shield bash them, then immediately get some distance between you and him so you have time to dodge. But if you keep *too* much distance by constantly moving away from him, he will always do rush attacks to close the distance. **Until he dispels his charge, make *no* attempt to attack.** If you charge your sword, Demise will attack you while the charging animation takes control from you.\n\nThe first time you stun Demise with a Skyward Strike, you can attack him until he blocks you. The second time, you will knock him down and be able to do a Fatal Blow. **DO NOT do the Fatal Blow on your first opportunity.** He will *always* get up before you land your blow and your sword will stick in the ground. Demise will not attack you while your sword is stuck, but your rhythm will be messed up and you'll be more likely to lose the next lightning bolt.\n\nAfter Demise gets up from being knocked over the first time, lightning will probably not be flashing right away. Raise your sword anyway, but watch Demise very carefully; he will almost always do a rush attack here, and if you do not put your sword down soon enough, lightning will strike it at just the right moment to disable you from blocking Demise.\n\nThe moment you block the rush attack, raise your sword and lightning will strike. Hit Demise with the bolt, attack him mercilessly, and *this* time **you can do the Fatal Blow and end the battle**."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the final battle against Demise, which of the following strategies is crucial for success in the second phase?\n\nA) Constantly attacking Demise with horizontal sword strikes\nB) Performing Fatal Blows whenever the opportunity arises\nC) Prioritizing charging your sword with lightning over Demise\nD) Maintaining close proximity to Demise at all times\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct strategy is to prioritize charging your sword with lightning over Demise. In the second phase of the battle, both Link and Demise compete for lightning strikes. By raising your sword at every possible moment when lightning flashes in the background, you can prevent Demise from charging his sword and gain an advantage. This allows you to stun Demise with a Skyward Strike and create opportunities for attack.\n\nOption A is incorrect because constantly attacking with horizontal strikes is not mentioned as an effective strategy and could leave you vulnerable.\n\nOption B is wrong because the text specifically advises against performing a Fatal Blow on the first opportunity, as Demise will always get up before you land the blow.\n\nOption D is incorrect because maintaining close proximity is not advised.

Aliases have been introduced in Angular 5\\.\n\nSo my modified solution is:\n\n```\n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-workspace-container',\n      templateUrl: './workspace-container.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./workspace-container.component.scss'],\n      animations: [\n        trigger('animRoutes', [\n          transition(':increment', right),\n          transition(':decrement', left),\n        ]),\n      ],\n  })\n  export class ComponentContainingRouterOutlet implements OnDestroy, OnInit {\n    //... ngOnInit,ngOnDestroy\n\n    constructor( private route: ActivatedRoute ) { }\n\n    animationState: number;\n\n    onActivate($event) {\n      this.animationState = this.route.firstChild.snapshot.data['routeIdx'];\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n\nCall animation at router\\-outlet position:\n\n```\n<div [@animRoutes]=\"animationState\">\n  <router-outlet (activate)=\"onActivate($event)\"></router-outlet>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nmodify routes definition as example, look at `data: { routeIdx: X }` :\n\n```\n    const routes: Routes = [\n      {\n        path: 'routeOne',\n        component: ComponentOne,\n        data: { routeIdx: 0 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeTwo',\n        component: ComponentTwo,\n        data: { routeIdx: 1}\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeThree',\n        component: ComponentThree,\n        data: { routeIdx: 2 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeFour',\n        component: ComponentFour,\n        data: { routeIdx: 3 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: '',\n        redirectTo: 'routeOne',\n        pathMatch: 'full'\n      }\n    ]\n\n```\n\nAnd transitions are the same as in [Dolan's](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49590255/6804292) post:\n\n```\nconst left = [\n    query(':enter, :leave', style({ position: 'fixed', width: '100%' }), { optional: true }),\n    group([\n        query(':enter', [style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n        query(':leave', [style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(100%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n    ]),\n];\n\nconst right = [\n    query(':enter, :leave', style({ position: 'fixed', width: '100%' }), { optional: true }),\n    group([\n        query(':enter', [style({ transform: 'translateX(100%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n        query(':leave', [style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n    ]),\n];\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Angular routing animation documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Angular 5+, which of the following code snippets correctly implements bidirectional slide animations for router transitions using the new animation aliases?\n\nA) \n```typescript\n@Component({\n  animations: [\n    trigger('routeAnimations', [\n      transition('* <=> *', slideTo('left')),\n    ]),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nB)\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  animations: [\n    trigger('animRoutes', [\n      transition(':enter', slideRight),\n      transition(':leave', slideLeft),\n    ]),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nC)\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  animations: [\n    trigger('animRoutes', [\n      transition(':increment', right),\n      transition(':decrement', left),\n    ]),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nD)\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  animations: [\n    trigger('routeAnimations', [\n      transition('* => *', [\n        query(':enter, :leave', style({ position: 'fixed', width: '100%' })),\n        group([\n          query(':enter', [\n            style({ transform: 'translateX(100%)' }),\n            animate('0.5s ease-in-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }))\n          ]),\n          query(':leave', [\n            style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }),\n            animate('0.5s ease-in-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)' }))\n          ])\n        ])\n      ])\n    ])\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct implementation for bidirectional slide animations using the new animation aliases introduced in Angular 5+. It uses `:increment` and `:decrement` to determine the direction of the animation based on the route index. This allows for dynamic left and right sliding animations depending on whether the user is moving to a higher-indexed route (increment) or a lower-indexed route (decrement). The other options either don't use the new aliases, implement only unidirectional animations, or use incorrect syntax for achieving bidirectional animations."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/23", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/928547", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/508845/"], "docs_id": 928547, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an Ubuntu 17\\.04 with LVM enabled installation on a Linux server (but running Ubuntu desktop at present).

Your two equations have two distinct sources:\n\n* The normal components must be equal, $J\\_{1n}\\=J\\_{2n}$, because otherwise there would be an accumulation of charge into the surface, which cannot be sustained in the steady state. This is because, for a normal from 1 into 2, the flow of charge that exits medium 1 in a small area $dA$ is $J\\_{1n}dA$ and the charge entering medium 2 is $J\\_{2n}dA$.\n* The tangential components on the other hand, can be different, because charge is just flowing past the boundary at different speeds. On the other hand, the electric field's tangential components must be continuous across the boundary, because otherwise there would be a nonzero circulation in the loop in your image. In a metal where Ohm's law holds, the current density is proportional to electric field,\n$$\\\\mathbf{J}\\=\\\\sigma \\\\mathbf{E}$$\nand therefore the current density's tangential components will not in general be constant across the boundary.\n\nThis actually makes a lot of sense physically. Consider the following situation: two conductors of (smallish) conductivities $\\\\sigma\\_1$ and $\\\\sigma\\_2$ are \"sandwiched\" between conducting plates with an applied voltage:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSAJu.png)\n\nHere you'd expect the current to be vertical, and greater in the material with greater conductivity. Thus the current density components tangential to the separating surface will *not* be equal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a steady-state scenario with two conducting media in contact, which of the following statements is correct regarding the electric field (E) and current density (J) at the boundary?\n\nA) Both the normal and tangential components of E and J are continuous across the boundary.\n\nB) The normal component of J and the tangential component of E are continuous across the boundary, while the tangential component of J may be discontinuous.\n\nC) The normal component of E and the tangential component of J are continuous across the boundary, while the normal component of J may be discontinuous.\n\nD) Both the normal and tangential components of E and J may be discontinuous across the boundary.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The normal component of current density (J) must be continuous across the boundary to prevent charge accumulation at the interface. The tangential component of the electric field (E) must be continuous to avoid infinite circulation loops. However, the tangential component of J can be discontinuous due to different conductivities in the two media, as J = \u03c3E, where \u03c3 is the conductivity.

I was busy with my day job. Our electric bill went **WAY** down, like 30\\-40% !!!

Say a sequence is of type $(X,Y)$ if it begins with $X$ and ends with $Y$.\n\nSo, there are \n\n1. $n$ sequences of type $(R,B)$\n2. $n$ sequences of type $(B,R)$\n3. $n\\-1$ sequences of type $(R,R)$\n4. $n$ sequences of type $(B,B)$ (and only $n\\-1$ of them if $n\\=m$).\n\nThus, the answer is $4n\\-1$ if $n \\< m$, and $4n\\-2$ if $n\\=m$. \n\n**Edit.** As Larry Denenberg mentions, in the degenerate case of $n\\=0$, the answer is always 1 (I count the empty string if $n\\=m\\=0$)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a linear arrangement of n red balls and m blue balls (n \u2264 m), we want to record the color code by noting only consecutive balls of the same color with a single color code. For example, RRBBB would be recorded as RB. How many possible color code orderings are there if n = 5 and m = 7?\n\nA) 19\nB) 20\nC) 21\nD) 22\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nSince n \u2264 m and n \u2260 m, we use the formula 4n - 1 for the number of possible color code orderings.\n\nWith n = 5:\n4n - 1 = 4(5) - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19\n\nLet's break down the possible sequences:\n1. (R,B) type: 5 sequences\n2. (B,R) type: 5 sequences\n3. (R,R) type: 4 sequences (n-1)\n4. (B,B) type: 5 sequences\n\nTotal: 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 19\n\nTherefore, there are 19 possible color code orderings when n = 5 and m = 7."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/06", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/254479", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/2578/"], "docs_id": 254479, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Cover/line\\-of\\-sight appears to work slightly differently in XCOM 2\\. For example, take this situation:\n\n[![Unit can't attack!](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaBVN.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaBVN.jpg)\n\nIn XCOM:EU, my unit would be able to attack the enemy in this situation *(see for example [this explanation of how LOS works in XCOM:EU](https://i.imgur.com/eqnBg.gif), under side\\-stepping)*.\n\nHowever, as you can see, she can't attack him. Why? How has cover/LOS changed in XCOM 2?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since no one (other than Firaxis) can know for sure, here's my interpretation of your picture:\n\nThe soldier you're trying to target isn't standing in the open door, but next to it. He's standing in the same line as your soldier, and the full\\-cover\\-box you can see behind the doorway.\n\nI think it's that specific box that is blocking your LOS. Even if we consider that your soldier sidesteps (so let's assume she's standing one tile to her left); it's possible that the slight elevation of the train cart combined with the angle of the box (relative to how your unit would see the enemy soldier) leads the game to decide it's not in LOS.\n\nThat being said, this is just a guess. I remember being in similar situation and seeing my target. The only thing different here is that box, which is why I'm thinking that's the reason.\n\n**Edit**  \n\nFor those who argue that the enemy (model) is in sight of the soldier, therefore it should be targetable, keep in mind that the game calculates based on the *tile* a unit is on, not the actual visibility of their character model. \n\nI find that units in cover really cling to the cover, or try to pop out their heads, and it throws off your vision on where the tile is located. If you look at OP's picture, you'll see how much difference there is between the enemy's body and the actual center of the tile they're standing on."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In XCOM 2, why might a unit be unable to attack an enemy that appears to be in line of sight?\n\nA) The game only considers character models for line of sight, not tiles\nB) Elevation differences always block line of sight in XCOM 2\nC) The game calculates line of sight based on the tile a unit occupies, not the visible character model\nD) Side-stepping mechanics were removed entirely in XCOM 2\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The game calculates line of sight based on the tile a unit occupies, not the visible character model. This can lead to situations where an enemy appears visible, but cannot be targeted due to obstructions blocking the center of their occupied tile. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the game does not solely consider character models for line of sight calculations. \n\nOption B is too absolute; while elevation can affect line of sight, it doesn't always block it completely.\n\nOption D is incorrect; while side-stepping mechanics may work differently in XCOM 2 compared to its predecessor, they weren't entirely removed.\n\nThis question tests understanding of game mechanics and the difference between visual representation and underlying calculations in video games."}}
