Cache may run on other host.\n\nComplex write requests may be done some centralized manner (only on one machine; with roles separation (web server/database)). Alternatively, you may consider doing scalable system with multiple nodes that can handle all requests, but it is going to be more complicated and should be considered if there will be further massive growth.\n\nIf the system is mostly read\\-only (like a collection of movies available for download), you may set up 2 hosts responsible for parts of content.

Using nginx as a reverse proxy on the first server allows for efficient load balancing and routing of requests. Moving the database to the second server helps distribute the computational load and storage requirements. Implementing proper caching for read-only requests can significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for frequently accessed data. This setup aligns with the recommendation in the documentation to separate roles (web server/database) and implement caching for read-only complex requests.

In Ubuntu, the recommended approach is to create separate user accounts for friends with non-administrative privileges. This allows friends to use the computer without compromising the security of the administrator account.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Ubuntu does not easily support multiple login options (like PINs) for a single account, unlike Windows.\n\nOption C is incorrect because SELinux is not typically used in Ubuntu. The documentation mentions it's more common in RHEL/Fedora and is generally considered complex.\n\nOption D is incorrect and unsafe. Sharing an administrator password compromises security and goes against best practices.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that in Ubuntu, unlike some other operating systems, the admin account does not run with elevated privileges by default.

I am happy to announce that we have met these goals. As of now, UI and Data changes are live network\\-wide that include showing the relevant CC versions for all post revisions and comments on all sites, updating footers, API updates, and other related sites.\n\nBefore detailing the changes, I will first address some of the open questions that remain [from our last update](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/344491/an-update-on-creative-commons-licensing).\n\n**The previous update defined the license changing from CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 to 4\\.0 on May 2, 2018\\. What happened on this date?**\n\nPrior to this date, the Terms of Service linked to CC BY\\-SA [3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). On this date, the link changed to point to the [4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. It was updated as part of a process that was not led by the Community Team and there was no public announcement at time due to an internal disconnect at the time of the release.\n\n**In that case, what about the change from CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5 to 3\\.0 that took place in [April 2011](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95033/51)? Shouldn\u2019t that also affect a similar change?**\n\nWe can now affirm that the same change in license that was posted on MSE to be effective as of April 8, 2011 (from version 2\\.5 to version 3\\.0\\) also could not have retroactively changed the license of content. The UI update laid out below will reflect this and will attribute each piece of content to the relevant license version.\n\nBased on this, we will be adopting the following rules relating towards classifying the licenses attached to content published on the site:\n\n* Content contributed before 2011\\-04\\-08 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).\n* Content contributed from 2011\\-04\\-08 up to but not including 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n* Content contributed on or after 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\n**How do edits work? Can edits change the license on content that was already posted on the site?**\n\n* Every time that a piece of content is published, the work is published under the CC BY\\-SA version as defined above, based on the publish date.\n* Every time a piece of content on the site is edited by a user, the editor creates a new version of the previous version. The new version of that work is considered to be republished and therefore governed under the CC BY\\-SA version in effect as of the day on which the edit was made.\n* Each revision to a work creates a new version and is licensed separately. Thus current version of any piece of content (that appears on the site) is the most recent revision, and will have a license version based on the date on which that revision was published.\n* This applies regardless of the size, the magnitude, or the significance of the edit that was made (except for the cases outlined below which are exceptions to this rule).\n* New edits do not modify the license that is attached to an old revision of the same content. That old revision continues to be licensed under its original CC BY\\-SA version.\n\nThe UI changes as defined below will make it clear (through the timeline page) the license version that applies to every revision for each question, answer, and comment on all sites.\n\n**Are there any types of post edits that do not cause new licensed revisions or changes to the license on the post?**\n\nYes, there are a few:\n\n* Title or Body Rollbacks: do not create new licensed versions, as they do not add any content to that which was already published. The license on the post changes to the license on the rollback target revision.\n* Tag applications to questions are considered to be meta\\-data and are not included in the content that is being licensed. Thus, tag\\-only edits or rollbacks do not effect any license changes or create new licensed versions\n* The following system\\-initiated post edits do not create new licensed versions:\n\t+ [Commonmark migration](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348746/were-switching-to-commonmark) edits\n\t+ URL Rewrites\n\t+ http to https replacements\n\t+ MSO link to MSE link replacements\n\t+ Insert/remove duplicate link edits\n\n**What license is applied to posts that are labeled Community Wiki?**\n\nWhen attached to a post, the [Community Wiki](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts) label changes the display of the post on the site, and changes the way in which reputation is assigned.\n\nRevisions to CW posts are to be treated in the same way as any other content revisions on the site with respect to the applicable license: licensed using CC BY\\-SA based on the date that the revision is made (which will be identifiable through the post timeline).\n\n**How can users upgrade the license of content that they own on the site from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0?**\n\nWe are thinking about how we might enable users to mass update and republish their questions and answers (across all sites on the network) to change the license version from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0\\. This will require more discovery work on our end so we don't yet have a time frame on if or when this might be available, or how it would work. This feature would not add the ability to republish a subset of content. It would be all or none.\n\n**What will be the process for future license updates? Can I agree in advance to any license upgrades that Stack Overflow might adopt in the future for new content?**\n\nWe will try our best to announce future license updates on the network at least one month prior to their being adopted for new content. This will give time for the Community to react and give feedback on the change.\n\nAny future license version updates will only affect new content (or new revisions published based on existing content) that is published after the new versions are adopted on the network. There will be no way for a user to agree in advance to automatically adopt future license changes to their existing content.\n\n**So what changes have been made?**\n\n1. The timeline for every question and answer has been updated.\n\t1. The top of the timeline page (underneath the title of the post) lists the CC BY\\-SA version of the latest revision made to the post.\n\t2. A new column labeled \u201clicense\u201d has been added to the timeline table.\n\t3. Each line in the timeline labeled as \u201chistory\u201d where the action is \u201casked\u201d, \u201canswered\u201d, or \u201cedited\u201d has the CC BY\\-SA version that is applied to the given revision.\n\t[![Example of license display on the Timeline (some rows removed from screenshot for ](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)\n2. The share post popover now includes a link to the license version applied to the post (decorated with an `rel=\"license\"` attribute)\n[![Share popover including license link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQjZe.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQjZe.png)\n3. Comment versions:\n\t1. The tooltip on the comment date includes the license version applied to that comment on creation.\n\t2. If a comment had multiple revisions, the revision display that is available to moderators gives the license version that applied to each revision of the comment.\n4. Footer text, other references:\n\t1. All references to the license throughout the site (including on the TOS) have been changed to \u201cCC BY\\-SA\u201d (or the same in lower\\-case).\n\t2. Text requiring attribution is no longer written. This is [implicit](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Attribution_required) from the definition of the \u201cBY\u201d section of the license name.\n\t3. The network footer has been updated to no longer reference version 4\\.0 of the license, and will now link to the [/help/licensing](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing) page.\n\t4. Other references to the license in other sections of the sites on the network have been updated in the same way.\n\t5. Area 51 footer has been updated accordingly.\n\t6. The [create chat page](https://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/new) has been [updated](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/347536/51) accordingly.\n\t7. The [Public Terms of Service](https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service#licensing) has been updated to use the correct format of \"CC BY\\-SA\" (instead of incorrect representations like \"CC\\-BY\\-SA\"). Current license version number (4\\.0\\) is included in text of the ToS (and not just in the link). A sentence has been added to the licensing section making reference to this post to give more details on how licenses are applied to content.\n5. API models include a new field called `content_license` that will return the license associated with that record:\n\t1. [Post](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/types/post)\n\t2.

The following tables available on [data.stackexchange.com](https://data.stackexchange.com/) will include (in the next refresh) a `ContentLicense` field: `Posts`, `PostHistory` and `Comments.`\n\nWe\u2019re happy to hear any feedback you might have and will try to answer any questions as best as we can. However, please understand that we\u2019re unable to provide any answers to questions about licensing that could possibly be interpreted as us giving legal advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Tag only edits trigger a license change.\n\n> [status\\-completed](/questions/tagged/status-completed \"show questions tagged 'status-completed'\")\n> \n> \n> *Update*: Tag\\-only edits no longer trigger license changes\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODLGz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODLGz.png)\n\nPlease ignore the rollback.\n\nIs this a bug?

Generally I'd like to allow them to get comfortable talking about what they like rather than what they think I'd like. However, that might not work this time as the student is a non\\-native english speaker and may get less comfortable as I try to get him/her to talk more.\n\nThus far I'm thinking about watching how he/she solves different problems in different areas of math, but I would like to know if anyone has done this before or has any suggestions for evaluating a student who might not be comfortable talking much.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, I'm a non\\-native English speaker, so I can provide some insight. \n\nI think that one of the first problems would be names and notation in general. As far as I can see, there is no easy way to solve this unless you already know the customs of the country the student is coming from, but your education will probably make it easier to guess what means what. For example in my country we use $log\\_{base}number$ for general case logarithms, $lg$ for $log\\_{10}$ and $ln$ for $log\\_e$. Another example would be popular sets. In some countries 0 is a natural number and in some other countries it isn't. Another example would be popular trigonometric functions. In my country for example secant and cosecant are considered deprecated and aren't used. Same thing with grads as angle measurement units.\n\nProblems with this part can be especially tricky because they can stay undetected for a long time. I've seen some math problems whose solutions depend on whether zero is a natural number or not. Another example here can be integrals. As far as I can see the most popular name in English for operation opposite of finding a derivative is antiderivation. In my area that's called indefinite integration and the indefinite part if often omitted.\n\nStill I think that most of the notational problems can be solved with Wikipedia.\n\nNext part would be names of fields of mathematics and popular theorems. How big problems this is going to be is closely related to which language terms come from. Sometimes terms are going to be shared between languages and sometimes there will be no direct translation. For example in my language, there is no term for calculus. Instead we use mathematical analysis, which as far as I know is superset of calculus.  \n\nAlso in some cultures some theorems are named after famous mathematicians and in some other cultures they are named after what the theorem describes. I can't find any examples right now, but I know I encountered such problems when asking few questions here. \n\nAnother problem could be non\\-existence of a concept. For example I was unable to find any mention of [Ivan Vsevolodovich Meshcherskiy's equation](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=sr&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fru.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%25D0%25A3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE) [(original article here](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE)) for bodies with variable mass in any English language web\\-sites. Here it's considered one of the fundamental rocketry equations, right next to Tsiolkovsky's formula. While the example is related more to physics than mathematics, be prepared to find similar examples in mathematics if the student is coming from a different culture.\n\nSince you said that student knows some English, here's my recommendation: Try starting a conversation about some topic in English and see if student is familiar with it. If it doesn't ring a bell, be ready to provide simple examples related to the area. I sometimes had problems finding exact name for some field of mathematics but immediately recognized it as soon as I saw a few simple problems. Another good idea would be to make a list of alternative names for every operation and see if some of them are familiar.\n\nYet another important thing is to have at least some familiarity with mathematics program which the student followed. Sometimes focus of what's studied in classes can be a bit different than what's written on paper. I remember now back when I was in secondary school we had formal mathematical proofs in books and they were supposed to be a part of the curriculum, but teachers in schools just decided that proofs are not important and did not teach them. Also in some schools less attention was payed to proper use of terminology. I know some of my friends who didn't know what was derivative and it's graphical representations, but knew that $x^2{'}\\=2x$ and same thing for integrals. Another point can be some obvious areas which may have been skipped. When was in secondary school, we didn't learn almost any probability and statistics and did very little work with percentages. On the other hand I see that in some other countries it's expected that someone who has graduated from primary school can without any problems calculate his interest rate.\n\nI can't think of anything else to add at the moment..."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mathematics professor is interviewing a non-native English speaking high school student to assess their mathematical knowledge and interests.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource forks, will also be preserved. It also copies, rather than follows, symbolic links.

There are around 0\\.5 million records in my dataset.\n\nI am restricted to use SAS E\\-Miner for this analysis. Currently I am using the following approach: \n\n1. Give appropriate decision weights (profit matrix)\n2. Undersample on the majority class or \"good\" records.\n3. Running a decision tree on the sample.\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. How can I undo the effect of undersampling of majority class?\n2. Does giving appropriate decision weights actually helps in removing the bias introduced because of undersampling? Or are these really two independent things.\n3. Even if these decision weights are applied, how do we determine the optimal decision threshold for basing our decisions.\n\nI have tried a boosting algorithm (without adjusting prior probabilities and without using decision weights) but the number of rules/patterns that get thrown up are around 20\\+ which seems like a mild concern to me. \n\nWould appreciate any inputs from CV community folks. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Removing samples from the majority class may cause the classifier to miss important concepts/features pertaining to the majority class.\n\nOne strategy called [informed undersampling](http://cse.seu.edu.cn/people/xyliu/publication/tsmcb09.pdf) demonstrated good results. Unsupervised learning algorithm is used to perform independent random sampling from majority class. Multiple classifiers based on the combination of each majority class subset with the minority class data are chosen.\n\nAnother example of informed undersampling uses the K\\-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to achieve undersampling. One of the [four methods on KNN](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/jzhang.pdf), looks most straightforward, called NearMiss\\-3, selects a given number of the closest majority samples for each minority sample to guarantee that every minority sample is surrounded by some majority samples. However, another method, NearMiss\\-2, in which the majority class samples are selected if their average distance to the three farthest minority class samples are the smallest, is proved the most competitive approach in imbalanced learning.\n\nThe profit (cost) matrix can be considered as a numerical representation of the penalty of classifying samples from one class to another. In decision tree, \n\n(1\\) cost\\-sensitive adjustments can be applied to the decision threshold; \n\nROC curve is applied to plot the range of performance values as the decision threshold is moved from the point where the total misclassifications on majority class are maximally costly to the point where total misclassifications on the minority class are maximally costly. The most dominant point on the ROC curve corresponds to the final decision threshold. Read [this paper](http://www.eiti.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/maloof-icml03-wids.pdf) for more details.\n\n(2\\) cost\\-sensitive considerations can be given to the split criteria at each node; \n\nThis is achieved by fitting an impurity function, and the split with maximum fitting accuracy at each node is selected. This [tutorial](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/elkan.pdf) generalizes the effects of decision tree growth for any choice of spit criteria.\n\n(3\\) cost\\-sensitive pruning schemes can be applied to the tree.\n\nPruning improves generalization by removing leaves with class probability estimates below a specified threshold. Laplace smoothing method on pruning technique is described in the same [tutorial](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/elkan.pdf) here to reduce the probability that pruning removes leaves on the minority class."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In addressing imbalanced datasets for pattern identification/classification problems, which of the following statements about informed undersampling is correct?\n\nA) It always removes samples randomly from the majority class without considering their importance.\n\nB) The NearMiss-2 method selects majority class samples that are closest to minority class samples.\n\nC) It uses unsupervised learning to perform independent random sampling from the majority class, and combines these subsets with minority class data to train multiple classifiers.\n\nD) The NearMiss-3 method is proven to be the most competitive approach in imbalanced learning.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

One possible end is that you go so far into debt that the banker will not accept the amount required to get you out of debt. Another possible end is just playing the game over and over again until the law of large numbers takes over, and you end up having an equal chance of making or losing money. In real life however, your odds are typically lower than 50/50, say 49/51, so even the second strategy is worse. You are guaranteed to lose money over a long period of time, compared to having a 49% chance of gaining money by just betting all on your first turn. The man is a fool, because he is betting all of his money on a single chance, but any other strategy is a bigger fool, because it is expected to end worse."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Gambler's Ruin problem, why does Coolidge assert that betting all on the first trial, while foolish, is less foolish than any other strategy?\n\nA) Because it maximizes the chance of winning in a single turn, avoiding the long-term disadvantages of an unfavorable game\nB) Because it minimizes the time spent playing, reducing exposure to the house edge\nC) Because it allows the gambler to quit while ahead if they win the first bet\nD) Because it gives the gambler the best odds of winning a specific amount, even though the odds are still unfavorable\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Coolidge's theorem states that in an unfavorable game, the best chance of winning a stated sum is to stake that sum in one turn. This is because any other strategy, such as spreading bets over multiple turns, exposes the gambler to the unfavorable odds for a longer period. In a game where the odds are against the player (e.g., 49/51), betting all at once gives a 49% chance of winning the desired amount. Any other strategy will, over time, approach the expected value dictated by the unfavorable odds, which is a loss. While betting everything at once is risky and can be considered foolish, it paradoxically offers the best mathematical chance of achieving the goal in an unfavorable game.

I have one fixed effect (Offset) and one random effect (chamber, with muliple data points coming from each chamber).\n\nIn the text book \"The R Book\", (2007\\), pg 604, Crawley suggests using the lmer function with a binomial family for the analysis of binomial data where each participant contributes multiple responses (analagous to each of my chambers contributing multiple outcomes). Based on this example, I have used the following script for my data:\n\n```\n    ball=lmer(Buried~Offset+(1|Chamber), family=binomial, data=ballData)\n\n```\n\nWhen I run this model, I get this warning:\n\n```\n    calling lmer with 'family' is deprecated; please use glmer() instead\n\n```\n\nWhen I change my code to the following, the model works:\n\n```\n    ball=glmer(Buried~Offset+(1|Chamber), family=binomial, data=ballData)\n\n```\n\nBased on other questions/answers that I have read on Cross Validated, lmer should only be used for data where the outcome is normally distributed, and glmer is the correct function to use for a binomial outcome. My questions are:\n\n1\\) Could anyone clarify the discrepency between Crawleys advice and the fact that lmer would not work for me (nor, based on what I have read on CVed, is it recommended to use this function for binomial data)\n\n2\\) Is glmer indeed the correct function to use to model a binomial outcome with random factors?\n\n3\\) Assuming that glmer is the correct function to use, I want to compare a model with and without random effects to determine if including random effects improves the fit of the model. I understand that glmer estimates model parameters via maximum likelihood. What function can I use to create a model with no random effects for a binary outcome using maximum likelihood? I was playing around with glm however the help file for this function states that the method of estimation is iteratively reweighted least squares (which is beyond me, but it isn't ML...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1\\) In previous versions of the `lme4` package, you could run `lmer` using the `binomial` family. However, all this did was to actually call `glmer`, and this functionality has now been removed. So at the time of writing Crawley was correct.\n\n2\\) Yes, `glmer` is the correct function to use with a binary outcome.\n\n3\\) `glm` can fit a model for binary data without random effects. However, it is incorrect to compare a model fitted with `glm` to one fitted with `glmer` using a likelihood\\-based test because the likelihoods are not comparable. From your description, you have repeated measures within chambers. So, assuming that you have sufficient chambers and these can be thought of as a random sample from a larger population of chambers, then *a priori* you should retain the random intercepts for `Chamber` to control for possible non\\-independence of observations within chambers. You can think of random intercepts as being part of the experimental design.\n\nOn the other hand, if the random effect variance is very small and/or the inference or predictions for both the `glm` and `glmer` model are the largely the same, then it really doesn't matter which you use anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing binary outcome data with repeated measures within chambers.

For primes p > 3, the number of solutions to x^2 + 3y^2 \u2261 1 (mod p) is p-1 if p \u2261 1 (mod 3), and p+1 if p \u2261 -1 (mod 3). This is because:\n\n1) The equation represents a smooth plane conic over Z/pZ, which generally has p+1 points in the projective plane.\n2) We need to subtract the number of points at infinity, which is the number of square roots of -3 mod p.\n3) The solutions come in triples due to the cube root of unity (-1+\u221a-3)/2, so the count must be a multiple of 3.\n4) For p \u2261 1 (mod 3), -3 is a quadratic residue mod p, so there are two points at infinity, leaving p-1 solutions.\n5) For p \u2261 -1 (mod 3), -3 is a quadratic non-residue mod p, so there are no points at infinity, leaving p+1 solutions.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it doesn't account for the variation based on p mod 3. Option C is incorrect as the solutions come in triples, not quadruples (which would be the case for x^2 + y^2 \u2261 1 mod p). Option D reverses the correct relationship between p mod 3 and the number of solutions."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/13", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/69198", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/39333/"], "docs_id": 69198, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **I bought a 24L bucket to fit the mix of 25KG of [self\\-leveling concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-leveling_concrete) (Thomsit DD\\+) and 6L of water.** Now, visually inspecting the thing, I can't really tell if it's large enough to handle the amount.

According to the documentation, the shutdown process first sends a SIGTERM signal to all running applications, giving them an opportunity to terminate gracefully. This allows applications to perform cleanup operations, such as saving open files or closing database connections. If an application doesn't respond to the SIGTERM signal within a certain timeframe, the system will then use a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate the process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the shutdown doesn't immediately kill applications without warning. It first attempts a gentle closure.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the shutdown process is autonomous and doesn't prompt users to save work in each application. It's the responsibility of the applications themselves to handle auto-saving or recovery files.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the shutdown process allows for graceful termination, it doesn't automatically save all open documents.

Define the probability measure $P$ on $\\\\B$ by the formula\n$$P(A):\\=\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty p\\_n P\\_n(A\\\\cap S\\_n) \\\\tag{1}$$\nfor all $A\\\\in\\\\B$.\n\nThen the random graph $G$ can be defined on the probability space $(S,\\\\B,P)$ as the identity mapping of $S$ to itself ($G(g):\\=g$ for all graphs $g\\\\in S$). Then\nthe distribution of the random graph $G$ will obviously be $P$.\n\nSince any probability measure on $\\\\B$ can be represented by (1\\), this way you can define a random graph with values in $S$ and any prescribed distribution over $S$ (that is, any prescribed distribution on the $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\B$)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a random graph G with vertices from the set [n] = {1,...,n} for some natural number n.

If P is a probability measure defined on the power set of S, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) P can only be defined as a uniform distribution over S\nB) P(A) = \u03a3(n=1 to \u221e) p_n P_n(A \u2229 S_n), where p_n are non-negative reals summing to 1 and P_n are probability measures on S_n\nC) The random graph G must be defined as a non-identity mapping from S to itself\nD) It's impossible to define a probability measure on the set of all finite graphs\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, we can define a probability measure P on the power set of S (denoted as B) using the formula P(A) = \u03a3(n=1 to \u221e) p_n P_n(A \u2229 S_n), where p_n are non-negative real numbers that sum to 1, and P_n are probability measures on the power sets of S_n. This allows for a flexible definition of probability over the set of all finite graphs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because P doesn't have to be uniform; we can define different P_n for each S_n.

It would only go backward, and forward movement would stutter. After some investigating, it turned out that one of the H\\-bridge NPN transistors is faulty. Since a direct replacement is difficult to get, I found a substitute. I wasn't worried too much about parameters, I thought transistors in an H\\-bridge operate in the saturation region and there should be a lot of leeway.\n\nHere is the schematic, reverse\\-engineered from the PCB:\n\n![H-bridge schematic, reverse-engineered from the PCB](https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1der.png)\n\nI substituted the original Q14 (2SD882, marked as NEC D882\\) with a BD238\\. The BD238 has a lower hFE (\\>40, instead of \\>80\\), and lower Ic, which I didn\u2019t think would matter. \\[**Edit**: as people correctly pointed out, the rather ridiculous mistake I made was that the BD238 is a PNP transistor! There is nothing like another pair of eyes. So, at least this part of the question is already answered.]\n\nWell, it turns out the replacement does not work. Which made me investigate the circuit closer, which made me realize that I don't really understand how it works, much less why the replacement doesn't work. And the circuit is rather interesting and uses very few components. Note for example the lack of catch diodes. I guess that's why transistors with Vceo\\=30V were used, with the hope they would withstand the voltage spikes.\n\nAfter replacing the faulty transistor, the motor never turns in the direction which is handled by that H\\-bridge branch.\n\nI tried a number of things. I narrowed it down to a single direction not working. Replacing the NPN transistor in that branch with a 2SD882 makes this direction work again. I also tried doubling the base currents (to possibly compensate for the lower hFE) by connecting another 47\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the 51\u03a9 resistor in the branch. No change.\n\nI thought about the B\\-E voltage drop of the new BD238 transistor \u2014 after all, the circuit is powered from about 5 volts, which has to be enough for 3 junctions (B\\-E of Q12, E\\-C of Q10 and B\\-E of Q14\\), but I can\u2019t see how it could be high enough to prevent the circuit from working.\n\nI am seeking answers to the following questions:\n\n* How does this circuit work? It has amazingly few components. Bringing one of the inputs low should switch on three transistors (for example, Q10, Q12 and Q14\\), but I don't see how just pulling the base of Q10 low would do that. Where does the voltage on Q12's base come from? There is no biasing, no pullups. Is bringing the base of Q10 low enough to start current flowing through Q12 (E\\-B)?\n* Why does replacing a 2SD882 with a BD238 not work? I have to understand this before I go looking for other replacements. \\[**Edit**: this part is already answered, I made the silly mistake of substituting a PNP transistor without noticing it.]\n* How important is PNP/PNP complementary pair matching in an H\\-bridge? I couldn't find any information on that. Everybody mentions that it's good to have a matching pair, but no rationale is given. I don't see how minor differences in hFE could (or should) influence the behavior of a simple motor driver circuit.\n\nThe toy car is powered by 4 D batteries (so slightly above 5 volts), and the motor draws about 0\\.4A in normal operation. I also measured the base current for the NPN H\\-bridge transistors when activated: it's 60mA when an 2SD882 is installed, and 2\\.2mA when the BD238 is installed.\n\nLinks to relevant datasheets, for easier access:\n\n* 2SD882: [http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439\\.pdf](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439.pdf)\n* BD238: [https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238\\.pdf](https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main problem is that the BD238 is a PNP transisor, not NPN!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In an H-bridge circuit for a toy RC car, a faulty NPN transistor (2SD882) was replaced with a BD238. The car then failed to move in one direction. What is the most likely reason for this malfunction?\n\nA) The BD238 has a lower hFE (current gain) than the 2SD882\nB) The BD238 has a lower Ic (collector current) rating than the 2SD882\nC) The BD238 is a PNP transistor, while the 2SD882 is an NPN transistor\nD) The BD238 has a higher Vceo (collector-emitter voltage) rating than the 2SD882\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The main issue in this scenario is that the BD238 is a PNP transistor, while the original 2SD882 is an NPN transistor. This fundamental difference in transistor type (PNP vs NPN) means the BD238 cannot function correctly in the circuit designed for an NPN transistor. PNP and NPN transistors have opposite polarity and operate in fundamentally different ways, so they are not directly interchangeable. This mistake in transistor type selection is the primary reason for the circuit malfunction, overshadowing any differences in other parameters like hFE, Ic, or Vceo ratings."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/27", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/120610", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/48650/"], "docs_id": 120610, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm writing about what people might call God when praying, things like \"Lord\" or \"Father\" etc. \n\nWith respect to using \"Dad\" or \"Mum\", would you call them names?

Since `ls` itself doesn't expand wildcards, this will result in the error you're seeing.\n\nSee [Why isn't this sudo mv operation with wildcard working?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/309244/281844) for more details on that.\n\n~~For a solution to this problem, you can use `sudo`'s `-s` argument, which spawns a shell as the target user (rather than simply executing a command directly), in which case if you also give it a command, it will be passed to the shell using the `-c` option (which is the usual option for the shell to interpret and execute a command, including wildcard expansion.)~~\n\nIn that case, you'll want to put the command within quotes (preferably single quotes), so that the shell running the `sudo` command will not try to interpret the command, only the one spawned by `sudo` as the target user:\n\n```\n# sudo -u authduser -s 'ls /mounted/filesystem/path/*.user.js'\n\n```\n\nSee the [man page of sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.3/sudo.man.html) for more details, in particular take a look at the `-s` option.\n\n**UPDATE:** It's not really possible to use `sudo -s` with a command here.

To solve this, use single quotes around the entire command: sudo -u authduser 'ls /mounted/filesystem/path/*.user.js'\n\nC) The error is due to a misconfiguration in the NFS server settings.

The core issue is that wildcard expansion happens before the sudo command is executed, which means the current user (who may not have sufficient permissions) attempts to expand the wildcard, resulting in the \"No such file or directory\" error. By enclosing the entire command in single quotes, we prevent the calling shell from expanding the wildcard and instead allow the shell running as the authorized user to perform the expansion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because granting root access would defeat the purpose of using root squash and could pose security risks.\n\nOption C is incorrect because disabling root squash is not a solution and could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\nOption D, while initially suggested in the documentation, is actually incorrect.
