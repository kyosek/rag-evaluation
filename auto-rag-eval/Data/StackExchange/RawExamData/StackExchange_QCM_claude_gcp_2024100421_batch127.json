Is *more* here acting as an adverb or a determiner? And isn't this a comma splice since each clause has a subject with no conjunction to link them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The parsing of the sentence in the question is ambiguous. There is no single, clear\\-cut way of looking at it.\n\n---\n\nBefore directly addressing the actual sentence, consider this:\n\n> 1\\. They are cooking apples.\n\n* They \u2192 pronoun, referring to people\n* are \u2192 auxiliary verb\n* cooking \u2192 verb\n* apples \u2192 noun\n\n> 2\\. They are cooking apples.\n\n* They \u2192 pronoun, referring to apples\n* are \u2192 verb\n* cooking \u2192 adjective\n* apples \u2192 noun\n\nSo, which is it? What grammatical function does *cooking* serve? The answer is *we don't know*. It would be resolved by context, but the grammar of the sentence itself, as a single sentence, changes depending on how it is viewed or interpreted. Or how it's parsed.\n\n---\n\nThe same holds true of the particular sentence in the question. What does it mean?\n\nThere is more than one way of interpreting it.\n\n---\n\n> **1\\. The more you have, the more you want.**\n> \n> \n> \u2192 If you have more, dependent clause then you want more. independent clause\n\nBut, as a comment under the question asked, how can *the more you want* be an independent clause, something that stands on its own? It can be if it's *parsed* to be:\n\n> The more you want.\n> \n> \n> \u2192 You want the more.  \n> \n>  \u2192 You want more.\n\nThis simply changes the word order, and then drops the article that would not normally be used.\n\nWhile the specific wording of the original and the restated version with the article are not idiomatic as sentences, they nonetheless would be phrased as the final version *you want more* if that's what the original was interpreted to mean.\n\nMany sentences that appear unusual, or even wrong, are still acceptable in archaic forms of English, or where the traditional SVO (Subject Verb Object) order has been changed. You might not normally use them, but they don't actually violate syntax. The reversed word order of Yoda in the *Star Wars* movies is famous for rearranging words in an order that sounds strange and would not normally be used, but which is still technically grammatical.\n\nGrammatical but strange such sentences are.\n\nThe problem with considering *only* the second half of the sentence in question, and considering it as an independent clause, is that the first half of the sentence is required in order to understand *why* it might be considered an independent clause.\n\nIf the *only* thing you are exposed to is the second half of the sentence, it's highly unlikely it would make sense to treat it as an independent clause; it's more likely it would be considered a noun phrase\u2014or sentence fragment.\n\nBut when analyzing the sentence as a whole, and parsing possible meanings, you have to consider the entire context.\n\n---\n\n> **2\\. The more you have, the more you want.**\n> \n> \n> \u2192 Having more means wanting more. a single independent clause\n\nIt's easier to understand why this rephrased version is a single independent clause\u2014because, unlike in the other interpretation, the wording here sounds natural.\n\nMy personal opinion (and it's entirely subjective) is that this is the least complicated way of parsing the sentence. Perhaps because of this, it's also the way in which I would normally look at it.\n\nAs in the analysis of the first interpretation, and how a changed word order didn't *necessarily* result in something ungrammatical, the fact that there's a comma in its original form doesn't necessarily mean that there's a dependent clause. It depends on how it's interpreted.\n\n---\n\nThere is a third interpretation of the sentence that could be given, and, following from the second interpretation, it supports the idea of a comma splice:\n\n> **3\\.

The slope of the regression line indicates the magnitude of change in the dependent variable (Y) for a unit change in the independent variable (X). A steeper slope, regardless of its sign, indicates a stronger influence. In this case, Y1 has a steeper slope (-112 compared to -90 for Y2), meaning it changes more dramatically with changes in X. While the R\u00b2 value is higher for Y1, which suggests a better fit, it doesn't directly measure the strength of influence. The slope is the key indicator of how much Y changes for a given change in X, making it the most appropriate measure of influence in this context."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/01", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/386721", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/648265/"], "docs_id": 386721, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I frequently encounter the following situations when dealing with new questions:\n\n* It's not quite clear which of multiple possible duplicates applies more to OP's situation\n* After suggesting one duplicate, I eventually find a better one\n* The OP edits/clarifies the question and the old suggested duplicate no longer applies, or some other one now applies better\n* In many cases, especially in the case of newbie question ([even fairly well\\-written ones](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56829001/doubling-amount-per-day-need-to-convert-number-of-pennies-to-dollars-cents?noredirect=1&lq=1)), a question has multiple concerns.

I tried to refactor code the brute way, i.e. by trying to guess what the code is doing and what changes wouldn't change it meaning, but without success: it randomly breaks features all around the codebase.\n\nNote that refactoring includes moving legacy C\\# code to a more functional style (the legacy code doesn't use any of the features of .NET Framework 3 and later, including LINQ), adding generics where the code may benefit from them, etc.\n\nI can't use [formal methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), given how much would they cost.\n\nOn the other hand, I presume that at least [\"Any refactored legacy code shall come with unit tests\"](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/155505/6605) rule should be strictly followed, no matter how much would it cost. The problem is that when I refactor a tiny part of a 500 LOC private method, adding unit tests appears to be a difficult task.\n\nWhat can help me in knowing which unit tests are relevant for a given piece of code? I'm guessing that static analysis of the code would somehow be helpful, but what are the tools and techniques I can use to:\n\n* Know exactly what unit tests should I create,\n* And/or know if the change I've done affected the original code in a way that it is executing differently from now?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have had similar challenges. The *Working with Legacy Code* book is a great resource, but there's an assumption that you can shoe\\-horn in unit tests to support your work. Sometimes that's just not possible.\n\nIn my archeology work (my term for maintenance on legacy code like this), I follow a similar approach as to what you outlined.\n\n* Start with a solid understanding of what the routine is currently doing.\n* At the same time, identify what the routine was *supposed* to be doing. Many think this bullet and the previous are the same, but there is a subtle difference. Often times, if the routine was doing what it was supposed to be doing then you wouldn't be applying maintenance changes.\n* Run some samples through routine and make sure you hit the boundary cases, relevant error paths, along with the mainline path. My experience is that the collateral damage (feature breakage) comes from boundary conditions not being implemented in exactly the same way.\n* After those sample cases, identify what's being persisted that doesn't necessarily need to be persisted. Again, I have found that it's side\\-effects like this that lead to collateral damage elsewhere.\n\nAt this point, you should have a candidate list of what's been exposed and / or manipulated by that routine. Some of those manipulations are likely to be inadvertent. Now I use `findstr` and the IDE to understand what other areas might reference the items in the candidate list. I'll spend some time understanding how those references are working and what their nature is.\n\nFinally, once I've deluded myself into thinking I understand the impacts of the original routine, I'll make my changes one\\-at\\-a\\-time and rerun the analysis steps I outlined above to verify that the change is working as I expect it to work. I specifically try to avoid changing multiple things at once as I have found this blows up on me when I try and verify the impact. Sometimes you can get away with multiple changes, but if I can follow a one\\-at\\-a\\-time route, that's my preference.\n\nIn short, my approach is similar to what you laid out.

Then a subset $R\\\\subseteq B$ is said to be independent if $R$ freely generates a subalgebra of $B$. Then $R$ is independent if and only if whenever $r\\_{1},...,r\\_{n}\\\\in R$ are distinct elements and for all $i$ either $s\\_{i}\\=r\\_{i}$ or $s\\_{i}\\=r\\_{i}'$ we have $s\\_{1}\\\\wedge...\\\\wedge s\\_{n}\\\\neq 0$. Recall that a subset $p$ of a Boolean algebra $B$ is a partition if $0\\\\not\\\\in p$, $\\\\bigvee p\\=1$ and where $a\\\\wedge b\\=0$ whenever $a,b\\\\in p,a\\\\neq b$. A collection of partitions $\\\\mathcal{P}$ of $B$ is said to be independent if whenever $p\\_{1},...,p\\_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $a\\_{1}\\\\in p\\_{1},...,a\\_{n}\\\\in p\\_{n}$ then $a\\_{1}\\\\wedge...\\\\wedge a\\_{n}\\\\neq 0$.\n\nThis notion of independence in a Boolean algebra can be thought of as both an algebraic independence and a probabilistic independence. For example, if $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are events in a probability space with $P(R\\_{i})\\\\in(0,1\\)$ for $1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n$ and $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are independent in the probabilistic sense, then $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are independent in a Boolean algebraic sense. \n\nThe main result about independence in Boolean algebras is the result by [Balcar and Franek](http://www.randomservices.org/random/prob/Independence.html) which states that every infinite complete Boolean algebra $B$ has an independent subset $R\\\\subseteq B$ with $\\|R\\|\\\\subseteq\\|B\\|$ and hence a free subalgebra $A\\\\subseteq B$ with $\\|A\\|\\=\\|B\\|$. One corollary of this result is that if $A,B$ are complete Boolean algebras with $\\|A\\|\\\\leq\\|B\\|$, then there is a surjective Boolean algebra homomorphism $\\\\phi:B\\\\rightarrow A$. Furthermore, Balcar and Franek go on to show that complete Boolean algebras have not just large free algebras, but they also have large independent sets of large partitions in the following sense.\n\nSuppose that $B$ is a Boolean algebra. Recall that the saturation $Sat(B)$ of $B$ is the least cardinal such that every partition of $B$ has cardinality less than $Sat(B)$. Then $B$ is said to be well\\-semifree if there is an independent family $\\\\mathcal{P}$ of partitions such that if $\\\\lambda\\<Sat(B)$, then $\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}:\\|p\\|\\=\\\\lambda\\\\}\\=Sat(B)$. A Boolean algebra $B$ is said to be saturation homogeneous if whenever $B\\\\simeq A\\\\times C$ and $\\|A\\|\\>1$ then $Sat(A)\\=Sat(B)$.\n\n> $\\\\mathbf{Theorem}$(Balcar and Franek) Every saturation homogeneous\n>  complete Boolean algebra is well\\-semifree.\n\nThe condition that the complete Boolean algebra $B$ is saturation homogeneous a very minor restriction since every complete Boolean algebra is a direct product of saturation homogeneous complete Boolean algebras."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about independence in Boolean algebras is NOT correct?\n\nA) An independent subset R of a Boolean algebra B freely generates a subalgebra of B.\n\nB) In a probability space, if events R1,...,Rn are independent in the probabilistic sense, they are also independent in the Boolean algebraic sense.\n\nC) The Balcar-Franek theorem states that every infinite complete Boolean algebra B has an independent subset R with |R| > |B|.\n\nD) A Boolean algebra B is well-semifree if it has an independent family of partitions P such that for any \u03bb < Sat(B), |{p \u2208 P : |p| = \u03bb}| = Sat(B).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is incorrect.

Yep, it's `true`, the closure returns `null` because `this` is not initialized when it executes.\n\n**Edit**\n\nI was curious about Thomas's statement, thinking that maybe they'd changed the behaviour in a subsequent VS release.

It was closed as \"won't fix.\" Odd.\n\nAs Microsoft says in their response, it is normally invalid to use the `this` reference from within the argument list of a base constructor call; the reference simply does not exist at that point in time and you will actually get a compile\\-time error if you try to use it \"naked.\" So, arguably it *should* produce a compile error for the closure case, but the `this` reference is hidden from the compiler, which (at least in VS 2008\\) would have to know to *look* for it inside the closure in order to prevent people from doing this. It doesn't, which is why you end up with this behaviour."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following code snippet:\n\n```csharp\nclass BaseClass\n{\n    protected BaseClass(Func<int> calc) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass DerivedClass : BaseClass\n{\n    private int _value;\n    \n    public DerivedClass(int value) \n        : base(() => _value * _value)\n    {\n        _value = value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the most likely outcome when creating an instance of DerivedClass?\n\nA) The code will compile and run without any issues\nB) A compile-time error will occur due to accessing an uninitialized field\nC) A NullReferenceException will be thrown at runtime\nD) The code will compile but produce unexpected results due to _value being 0\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The code will compile because closures are valid in this context.

If you do this continually, you will see this context switching take a lot of the overall time, but if you have 2 threads running on 2 CPUs, you're not going to see any switching at all. How long exactly does a context switch take? depends on the CPU \\- risc processors have more registers so take longer. How long is a thread quanta? depends on the OS.\n\nThe other cost is in CPU cache invalidation \\- if 2 threads are running on the same CPU, and each one is working of different data, then the required data will have to re\\-fetched which will slow things down tremendously on modern CPUs (you won't see this effect so much on older CPUs)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multi-threaded application running on a dual-core processor, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the performance impact of increasing the number of threads beyond the number of CPU cores?\n\nA) Increasing the number of threads will always lead to better performance due to increased parallelism.\n\nB) The performance will remain constant regardless of the number of threads, as long as the total workload remains the same.\n\nC) Increasing the number of threads beyond the number of cores may lead to decreased performance due to context switching and cache invalidation overheads.\n\nD) The performance impact will solely depend on the length of the thread quantum set by the operating system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Increasing the number of threads beyond the number of available CPU cores can lead to decreased performance due to several factors:\n\n1. Context switching overhead: When there are more threads than cores, the CPU must switch between threads, saving and restoring register states. This process consumes time and resources.\n\n2. Cache invalidation: Different threads working on different data can cause CPU cache invalidation, requiring data to be re-fetched from memory, which significantly slows down modern CPUs.\n\n3.

Your transistor isn't actually 2N2222,\n2. Your circuit is not wired as you think,\n3. Your voltage isn't 22 V,\n4. You have something (unsuitable) connected at output,\n5. Faulty test equipment is leading you completely astray.\n\nObviously the easiest things to check are the wiring, the resistor values, and the voltage. Comments have made the suggestion that you have a counterfeit part \\-\\- certainly a possibility. Also of course if the test equipment is faulty, Vout could be something else. If you're getting surprising results: *always check the test equipment.* In this particular case, given that the transistor is burning up, it's pretty evident something is very wrong.\n\nThe first thing to check is the pinout, both from datasheet for the exact part number, and by confirming on the actual device.\n\nVariant Pinout\n--------------\n\nAnother possibility is that your transistor has a different pinout than you're expecting, such as the P\\-variant:\n\n[![Image of different transistor pinouts](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoX2r.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoX2r.png)  \n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222)\n\nWhich would mean you actually have the following, which has VEB of 22 V, where the limit is 6 V (see datasheet portion below).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zysn.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f5zysn.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIdentifying Pins\n----------------\n\nThe classic method for identifying the pins of an out\\-of\\-circuit NPN transistor is to measure the voltage drop with the diode\\-mode of a multimeter. You expect approximately 0\\.6 V measuring from B to C and from B to E, and OL in all the other pairings. The one with the slightly larger drop is the emitter. The 2N3904 I just measured gave 0\\.664 V and 0\\.684 V. (Sorry, no 2N2222 to hand.)\n\nI recommend you try this on your parts which are burning up and see if you can confirm the pinout.\n\nDatasheet Fragment\n------------------\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5i74i.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5i74i.png)\nFrom [datasheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331223626if_/https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/CD00003223%2epdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student is troubleshooting a circuit using a 2N2222A transistor that is burning out at 22V, despite the datasheet specifying a VCE(max) of 40V. Which of the following is the MOST likely explanation for this issue, and what should be the FIRST step in diagnosing the problem?\n\nA) The transistor is counterfeit. The first step should be to purchase a new transistor from a reputable supplier.\n\nB) The circuit is incorrectly wired. The first step should be to carefully review and verify the circuit connections against the schematic.\n\nC) The transistor has a different pinout than expected. The first step should be to use a multimeter to identify and confirm the transistor's pins.\n\nD) The test equipment is faulty. The first step should be to calibrate or replace the power supply and multimeter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options are possible, the most likely explanation given the information is that the transistor has a different pinout than expected, possibly being a P-variant. This could result in a VEB of 22V, exceeding the 6V limit and causing failure. The first diagnostic step should be to confirm the pinout using a multimeter in diode mode to measure voltage drops between pins. This is a quick, non-destructive test that can immediately reveal if the pinout is the issue, allowing for correction before further damage occurs. Options A and D are less likely given the specific voltage at which failure occurs, and while B is possible, verifying the pinout is a more targeted first step given the symptoms described."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/29", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/191493", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/82178/"], "docs_id": 191493, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need 6 feet of metal clad (MC) cable.

All I knew is, that I can declare variables like:\n\n```\nfoo=\"my dear friends\"\nbar[0]=\"one\"\nbar[1]=\"two\"\nbar[2]=\"three\"\n\n```\n\nor accessing them with a $ sign, like:\n\n```\necho $foo\necho ${bar[1]}\n\n```\n\nor using inbuilt variables, like:\n\n```\necho $PWD\nPATH=$PATH:\"/usr/bin/myProg\"\n\n```\n\nNow, I hear there are two (at least?) types of variables: shell variables and environment variables.\n\n* What is the purpose of having two different types?\n* How do I know which type a variable is?\n* What are the typical usages for each one?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Environment variables are a list of `name=value` pairs that exist whatever the program is (shell, application, daemon\u2026). They are typically inherited by children processes (created by a `fork`/`exec` sequence): children processes get their own copy of the parent variables.\n\nShell variables do exist only in the context of a shell. They are only inherited in subshells (i.e. when the shell is forked without an `exec` operation). Depending on the shell features, variables might not only be simple strings like environment ones but also arrays, compound, typed variables like integer or floating point, etc.\n\nWhen a shell starts, all the environment variables it inherits from its parent become also shell variables (unless they are invalid as shell variables and other corner cases like `IFS` which is reset by some shells) but these inherited variables are tagged as exported1. That means they will stay available for children processes with the potentially updated value set by the shell. That is also the case with variables created under the shell and tagged as exported with the `export` keyword.\n\nArray and other complex type variables cannot be exported unless their name and value can be converted to the `name=value` pattern, or when a shell specific mechanism is in place (e.g.: `bash` exports functions in the environment and some exotic, non POSIX shells like `rc` and `es` can export arrays).\n\nSo the main difference between environment variables and shell variables is their scope: environment variables are global while non exported shell variables are local to the script.\n\nNote also that modern shells (at least `ksh` and `bash`) support a third shell variables scope. Variables created in functions with the `typeset` keyword are local to that function (The way the function is declared enables/disables this feature under `ksh`, and persistence behavior is different between `bash` and `ksh`). See <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/28349/2594>\n\n1This applies to modern shells like `ksh`, `dash`, `bash` and similar.

Shell variables that are exported (using the 'export' command) can also be inherited by child processes.\n\nOption B is correct. When a shell starts, it typically inherits environment variables from its parent process and these become shell variables as well. However, not all shell variables are environment variables, especially if they haven't been exported.\n\nOption C is correct. Shell variables can indeed be more complex, including arrays and other data types depending on the shell, while environment variables are always simple string name-value pairs.\n\nOption D is correct.

However, if one side has very large polygons that encompass many smaller polygons from the other set, it could lead to a much longer processing time.\n\nWhile the total number of rows, spatial indexes, and specific PostGIS functions used are all relevant factors, the relative sizes and complexity of the geometries have the most direct impact on the number of comparisons that need to be made, which is the primary determinant of query performance in this scenario."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/10", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/486375", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/157567/"], "docs_id": 486375, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I'm trying to get OpenVPN to work on port 53 \\- sadly this isn't working. \n\nI used IP tables to map port 53 to port 1194 (standard OpenVPN port)\n\nHere's what I run to do this:\n\n```\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1194\niptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n\n```\n\nThis works as the connection is fine except for when I try to visit new domains!

Living in an arid climate does create quite the change in temperature, do you ever get below freezing there? Code up here is at least 18\" underground and sleeved if the water line is not approved for underground. I would suggest PVC sch80 pipe as I believe that is approved. The pressure loss is also minimal for the length of pipe in PVC but the number of elbows you are proposing, which I am counting 9 is a total friction loss of about 38 feet of head which is 16 psi. Now I am not saying you'll loose that much off the piping but the calculation suggest it. That is the garage application. Now on average from a water softener you will also lose about 5 psi. I understand the aesthetics your house is important, but I would keep it outside behind the fence if you guys down there have weather that doesn't go below freezing. If you do I would box it and put heat trace on the softener and lines.

Placing the water softener outside behind the fence reduces the complexity of plumbing and pressure loss associated with running pipes to and from the garage.

Like chat flags they *can* be auto\\-handled if enough flags pile up...but that's not a common situation.\n\nSolution? **Show comment flags to 10k users** and allow them to be acted on more like chat flags; users can add a flag to valid flags to help bring bad comments to their doom, and users can mark flags invalid just like Chat flags. \"Other\" flags would still show up for moderator\\-only intervention, but Spam/Offensive/Chatty/Obsolete comments could easily be handled by the community...if only they could see them.\n\n**Show context** to allow users to see the Post that was commented on and all the other comments. This helps for when it's hard to tell if a post is irrelevant/ect or not. It could ideally be inline, just like Review.\n\nMarking a flag down seems more risky, I don't think it's essential to this proposal but I think it could help. My idea is to require `flags + 1` \"disputed\" flags on a comment flag to cancel flags. This would allow invalid flags to be cleared from the queue by non\\-mods, but would always require more people to agree *against* a flag, basically so just one user can never invalidate a flag.

Chat flags are annoying because you *can't escape them*.\n* Don't accidentally suspend people. No grief about \"why was I suspended\" because the worst that happens is a comment is deleted. Comments are lightweight anyway.\n* Don't cause a \"blue rush\" or surge of moderators/users trying to find out the context of the flag.

Having the ability to review comment flags would help share moderation responsibility with the rest of the site's community. \n\n---\n\nSome suggestions in order to make this workable:\n\n* Context needs to be provided around the comment, so the reviewer can understand the ramification (if any) of removing the comment. Context would be the original post, seeing the \"last edited\" notice on the post, and surrounding comments.\n* Tally the existing flags against the comment, and potentially indicate the number of additional flags required in order to remove the comment.\n* Allow reviewers to use all of their daily allowance with comment flags. If 10k\\+ userA can flag 100 comments in a day, then allow 10k\\+ reviewerB to have up to 100 concurring flags to support what userA flagged.\n* I don't know if a \"disagree\" response is really required at this point for comment flagging. It seems like extra, unnecessary overhead when the point is to help clear out the ephemeral aspects of the sites. Just let the reviewer skip that particular comment and move on to the next in the queue.\n* Likewise, I don't think we need the gamification aspects like we have with the main review queues. We don't need badges (*gasp!*); we don't need public rankings; we don't need public history of comment flag reviews. We just need to get rid of the garbage, ephemeral comments.\n* There would be bonus points for this review mechanism if it could push the \"rude / offensive\" comment flags to the front of the review queue so they are handled more urgently than the other flags."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the StackExchange documentation, which of the following proposals is suggested to improve the handling of comment flags?\n\nA) Allow all users to see and act on comment flags, similar to chat flags\nB) Show comment flags only to moderators and increase their priority\nC) Show comment flags to 10k+ users and allow them to act on them, similar to chat flags\nD) Automatically delete any comment that receives a flag\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation suggests showing comment flags to 10k+ users and allowing them to act on these flags, similar to how chat flags are handled.

Assume your people know enough to do the assignment without micromanagement or the requirement to constantly check in. Build a set of guidelines for when they *should* check in \\- which should only be when the work is either done or so truly messed up that serious intervention is needed. If possible, stay away from even needing to be in the loop on interteam support issues.\n* **Be honest** \\- that has several corollaries:\n\t+ Be honest about yourself \\- \"I won't have time until Tuesday\", \"I've never done that, here's my best guess\", etc.\n\t+ Be honest about the team and where they fit in the company \\- if you know something about the business stuff, tell them if you can, and tell them what you know as the straight facts.\n\t+ Be honest in giving feedback \\- don't mince words or soft pedal if you have give negative feedback. That's different from \"brutally honest\" \\- you can still have compassion, but if something's wrong, say so.\n\t+ Be honest when you know the work is more about redtape than getting something meaningful done. Into everyone's life, some meaningless work will fall. Don't pretend it's meaningful. Call it like is, so you can all focus on getting past it and getting on to something useful.\n* **Listen**. At least 50% of your job is listening, maybe more. You have suddently become responsible not just for the technical work, but the people doing it. You have to listen to learn not just about the problems the team is having, but also how your people approach the problem and what the team's shortcomings as a group are.\n\t+ Important corollary \\- listening can directly lead to point \\#1 \\- giving meaningful work \\- engineers are great at coming up with ways to make development easier. You can't approve everything, but where the idea is good, give the engineer the assignment, and they have essentially done you work for you \\- they created the meaningful work and told you just what it is.\n* **Say \"thank you\"**. I know, it seems obvious. While we all love money, better tools, a nicer work environment and promotions \\- the way to get to these things is by a series of good efforts, each of which deserves a \"thank you\". \"Thank you\" is totally free, you'll never run out of them, and knowing that your manager has seen and appreciated your hard work is definitely motivating.\n* **Spend time on the big picture**, even if it means sacrificing some portion of the day to day work that got you the position. It's probably true that you can code better than some of your people, but if you don't spend a decent set of time on the big picture \\- the team, the overall project direction, the state of your codebase, the efficiency of your processes, your team's environment \\- then you won't be doing the job they need you to do.\n* **Learn to be a buffer for your team**. Engineering teams work best when they have the time to do ... engineering. Corporate bureaucracy is not engineering. Anything you can do to take the annoying 1 per year/month/week meetings with external people is better. NOTE: That doesn't mean agile meetings with stake holders \\- that's engineering, your team needs to be there for that. I mean the meeting with facilities who wants to put a loud shrieking piece of machinery near your team, or the process group that wants your team to fill out papers in triplicate before any code gets checked in. You are the flak absorption system.\n* **Assume problem people are not evil**, they are people who want to do good but haven't figured out how yet. You're not going to be able to fix everyone, but often the first few complete screw ups are as much a factor of failed communication as they are incompetence or deliberate malice. If you start with the assumption that people are not evil, you have a decent hope of avoiding a number of the evil boss archetypes of the list above.\n\nAnd probably most important... **respect**. If you honestly can't respect the members of you team, you have to work on changing that (whether that's teaching people or changing your headcount). Give respect day one and you will get it back, treat people with a lack of respect and you will never get respect in return.\n\nTaken together, if you do most of these things, most of the time then your team will give you the benefit of the doubt when you show you are human and totally screw something up yourself. :) Every boss has their own drawbacks, and it's as much about working out a relationship with your team where they can help you compensate for your weaknesses as you help them with theirs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a new team lead for a group of software developers, which combination of actions would be most effective in creating a productive and satisfying work environment?\n\nA) Solve problems for your team members, be brutally honest in feedback, spend most of your time coding, and hold frequent meetings with external stakeholders.\n\nB) Encourage ownership of work, be honest about yourself and the company, listen to your team members, and spend time on the big picture of the project.\n\nC) Micromanage team members' tasks, keep company information confidential, focus on day-to-day coding, and avoid giving negative feedback.\n\nD) Give meaningless work to keep the team busy, be vague about project goals, handle all communication with stakeholders yourself, and assume problem employees are intentionally difficult.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B encompasses several key points from the documentation that contribute to effective team leadership:\n\n1. Encouraging ownership of work aligns with giving meaningful work and fostering problem-solving skills.\n2. Being honest about yourself and the company promotes transparency and trust within the team.\n3. Listening to team members is crucial for understanding their needs and improving team dynamics.\n4. Spending time on the big picture allows the leader to focus on overall project direction and team efficiency.\n\nOptions A, C, and D each contain elements that contradict the advice given in the documentation. For example, solving problems for team members (A) goes against encouraging ownership, micromanaging (C) is discouraged, and giving meaningless work (D) is the opposite of providing meaningful tasks. The correct approach balances empowerment, honesty, active listening, and strategic thinking."}}
