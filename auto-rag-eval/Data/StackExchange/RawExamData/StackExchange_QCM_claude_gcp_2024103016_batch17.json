The existence of the limit of the second-order divided difference does not necessarily imply the existence of the second derivative at x = 0. For any odd function f(x), we have f(-x) = -f(x), so f(h) + f(-h) = 0 for all h. This means the limit lim(h\u21920) [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h\u00b2 = 0 for all odd functions, regardless of their differentiability properties.

Normally the points are dynamic: that is, they are not given beforehand. (If they are available in advance, or in very large groups, some optimizations based on sorting them will be available.) Let *Q* be the number of query points and *P* be the number of polygon *vertices.*\n\n### Vector polygon data\n\n(1\\) **Few points, few polygon vertices *in toto***. Use a brute\\-force procedure, such as the classic [line\\-stabbing algorithm](http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2007/07/ultimate-point-in-polygon.html). For any decent method, the cost is O(P\\*Q), because it costs O(1\\) time to compare a point to a polygon edge and all such comparisons have to be made.\n\n(2\\) **Possibly many polygon vertices, but they are dynamic:** each time a point is used in the query, the polygons might all have changed. Again use a brute\\-force algorithm. The cost is still O(P\\*Q), which will be large because *P* will be large, but there's no helping that. If the changes are small or controlled (*e.g.*, the polygons are slightly changing shape or simply moving around slowly) you might be able to use a version of the next solution and find an efficient way to update the data structures as the polygons change. That would likely be a matter for original research.\n\n(3\\) **Many polygon vertices and static polygons** (that is, the polygon layer will rarely change). Precompute a data structure to support the search (which could be based on a [line sweep](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=lineSweep) or a [quadtree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) algorithm). The cost of precomputation for these algorithms is O(P\\*log(P)), but the cost of the queries becomes O(Q\\*log(P)), so the total cost is O((P\\+Q)\\*log(P)).\n\nSome improvements are available in **special cases**, such as \n\n(a) **All polygons are convex** ([preprocessing the polygons can be done more quickly](http://erich.realtimerendering.com/ptinpoly/)), \n\n(b) **All polygon interiors are disjoint**, in which case you can think of their union as being a single polygon (which allows for straightforward efficient algorithms, such as those based on triangulation, and \n\n(c) **Most polygons are not very tortuous**\\-\\-that is, they occupy large portions of their bounding boxes\\-\\-in which case you can do an initial test based on the bounding boxes only and then refine that solution. This is a popular optimization.\n\n(d) **The number of points is large.** Sorting them might improve the timing. For instance, when implementing a left\\-to\\-right line sweep point\\-in\\-polygon algorithm, you would sort the points on their first coordinate, allowing you to sweep over the points at the same time you sweep over the polygon edges. I'm not aware that such an optimization has been published. One that has been published, though, is to perform a [constrained triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation) of the union of all the points and polygon vertices: once that triangulation is complete, identifying the interior points should be quick. Computational cost will scale as O(Q\\*log(Q) \\+ (P\\+Q)\\*log(P\\+Q)).\n\n### Raster polygon data\n\nThis is incredibly easy: view the polygon layer as a binary indicator raster (1\\=inside a polygon, 0\\=outside). (This could require a lookup table to convert raster values to inside/outside indicators.) Each point probe now requires O(1\\) effort to index the raster cell and read its value. Total effort is O(Q).\n\n### In general\n\n**A nice *hybrid solution*** in the case of many static vector polygons (vector case 3 above) is initially to rasterize the polygons, perhaps even with a coarse resolution, this time distinguishing any cells intersecting any part of a polygon boundary (give them a value of 2, say). Using a raster probe (cost: O(1\\)) typically results in a definite answer (the point is known to be inside or outside), but occasionally results in an indefinite answer (the point falls in a cell through which at least one edge passes), in which case the more expensive O(log(P)) vector query is made. This method incurs some extra storage cost for the raster, but in many cases even a small raster (one MB will allow for a 2000 by 2000 raster that stores {0,1,2,null} values) can confer huge advantages in computational time. Asymptotically, the computational effort is the same as for a vector solution, but in practice it is O(Q \\+ P\\*log(P)) and possibly as low as O(Q\\+P) (achieved by using a very fine resolution for the raster and using brute\\-force methods for the very rare vector queries that have to be performed)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS application needs to determine which polygons contain a given set of points.

Hopefully I'm not too much of a caveman to express myself properly.\n\nWhat does thermal conductivity actually express? Is it measuring the *amount* of heat that transfers through a material? Or the speed at which the heat transfers? Or some combination of the two? Or something else?\n\nFor example, if I have a wall with such\\-and\\-such thermal conductivity and a heat source on one side, what does thermal conductivity actually tell me for the amount of heat that will be transferred to the other side, how long that will take, and so on?\n\n**Edit:** if thermal conductivity is the *speed* of heat transfer, what am I to make of the fact that dense materials like concrete and compressed earth blocks have a high thermal conductivity (\u22481\\.5\\) relative to dedicated insulation materials (\u22480\\.04\\), yet heat transfers through them slowly\\-\\-this property being explicitly utilized in certain applications, in fact, such as passive solar design.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Thermal conductivity measures the speed at which heat energy travels through material.\n\nThat's different to the speed at which changes in *temperature* travel through material, which is driven by a combination of thermal conductivity and thermal mass.\n\nSo, to use your example, concrete has a high thermal conductivity: it will lose heat energy quite quickly, so a hot thing inside a concrete box can cool down quite quickly. However, concrete has high thermal mass: it takes a lot of energy to raise its temperature by 1 Kelvin. So even with heat going into it quickly, its temperature will rise slowly.\n\nThat's why concrete and earth walls are used in some passive solar designs: not necessarily for their insulation properties, but for their properties as a heat *buffer*: they can absorb a lot of heat for relatively low changes in their own temperature, and radiate it back out again. That gives you a wall surface with a fairly steady radiant temperature, which feels a lot more comfortable than a surface with a highly variable radiant temperature; and it gives you a huge buffer that allows you to store solar energy in the day and release it at night, thus giving you cooling during the day when you need it, and heating during the night when you need it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A building designer is considering different materials for a passive solar design.

This allows it to act as a heat buffer, absorbing excess heat during the day and slowly releasing it at night when temperatures drop.\n\nThe high thermal conductivity of concrete ensures that heat can move through the material at a reasonable rate, allowing for effective heat distribution. However, due to its high thermal mass, the actual temperature changes occur slowly, which is beneficial for maintaining stable temperatures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because concrete actually has a relatively high thermal conductivity compared to insulation materials.\nOption B is partially correct about conductivity but doesn't account for thermal mass.\nOption C is incorrect as concrete has high, not low, thermal mass.\nOption D correctly combines both the high thermal mass and conductivity properties that make concrete effective for passive solar design."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/02/17", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/156838", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4084/"], "docs_id": 156838, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Which one is better and correct answer for below question?\nCan we use May have for current possibilities?\n\nQue : Where is your boss ?\n\nAns 1 : He may have left for the day.\n\nAns 2 : He may be left for the day. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **May have** \\+ past participle refers to something that happened in the past: **may be** refers to something that is happening now.\n\n> He may have left for the day \\- *past*   \n> \n>  He may be in his office \\- *present*\n\nNote that **[maybe](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/maybe)** (without the space) can be used to intruduce doubt into a sentence.

Today I got curious and went to other big sites on the network, and this site does feel anomalous: the top users on [Super User](https://superuser.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) and [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) would make 7th and 13th here, despite both sites being [rather older](http://stackexchange.com/sites) and with a higher turnover in terms of questions per day. On sites with a similar age and questions\\-per\\-day turnover as Tex.SE such as [Physics](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) and [Electrical Engineering](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all), the top two rows of users have much less reputation than here. You have to go to [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all) to find something comparable, among sites with a similar age, but they're churning through something like seven times as many questions as here.\n\nOf course, it's quite possible that in terms of total amounts of reputation things are a bit more in line, but there I don't quite have the statistics chops to make a meaningful comparison. Either way, TeX.SE must either have (a) much more rep (hence also votes) to go around as other comparable sites, or (b) a much more skewed rep distribution curve. [This query](http://data.stackexchange.com/tex/query/206518/reputation-histogram-log-log-scale#graph) sort of vaguely supports the latter but then again you'd have to be quite careful with your comparisons.\n\nFor now, though, I want to ask this community what you think this says about this site. Does this strike you as a reasonable observation? What would you attribute it to?\n\n---\n\nEdit:\n\nThere's a strong emphasis in the responses on the total number of votes, and I don't think I quite buy it. It is [very easy](http://data.stackexchange.com/superuser/query/492368/total-upvotes-and-downvotes) to query for the total upvotes and downvotes in a site, and the data isn't at all unambiguous. For the comparisons above, it currently looks like this:\n\n```\n        TeX.SE   Super User   Server Fault   Physics        EE    Mathematics\n  \u2191  1,440,460    1,964,282      1,261,362   575,663   466,268      3,511,289\n  \u2193     17,360      254,889        168,570    91,254    78,871        380,931\n\n```\n\nFrom this, there's a few points worth emphasizing:\n\n* Compared to sites equivalent in age and current turnover, Physics and Electrical Engineering, TeX.SE does have way more upvotes around.\n* Similarly, the downvote count does seem rather low compared to everyone else.\n* However, SuperUser has a lot less rep on the top pages than TeX.SE... but it still has sizably more upvotes in the database.\n* The site with a comparable leaderboard, Mathematics, has more than twice the total rep.\n* While SU and SF do have more downvotes than TeX.SE, the negative effect of downvotes on rep is 1/5th of an upvote, and the count of (upvotes \\- 0\\.2 downvotes) for SU is still higher than the total upvotes of TeX.SE.\n* That means that explanations along the lines of \"we don't downvote\" that don't address that ratio have rather low explanatory power.\n\nFor me, that says that there also needs to be more concentration of rep on the top tiers, which ties in with (and provides evidence for) [Should high\\-rep users hang back a little?](https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1867/should-high-rep-users-hang-back-a-little).\n\nAlso, just to be clear,\n\n* Yes, rep is just fake internet points and ultimately doesn't matter. However, metrics like these do carry a nontrivial amount of information about each community and they are a reflection of the informal culture in the group.\n* Along similar lines, most of the comments saying 'it doesn't matter' and the like seem to come mostly from people whose experience on the SE network is here or on StackOverflow, and who may not be in a position to see just how crazy\\-high that rep board looks like. Trust me \\- it's anomalously high, and very much so. Hence this question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Several reasons:\n\n1. We vote a lot, and we vote up.\n2.

Ultimately, **can I claim that the value of $password is not stored on the server?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As [pointed out by Mat in the comments](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/78569/does-php-exec-store-the-executed-command-anywhere#comment115419_78569), unless you specifically set up auditing it is highly unlikely that the *command as such* is deliberately stored anywhere and kept in a directly accessible form. `grep -lR ... /` as root might be an enlightening experience (you may want to remount everything `noatime` first...).\n\nHowever, there is always a \"but\". In this case, one obvious possibility that I can see (especially as you don't securely clear the $password or $estring variables in the code you have shown) is that the contents of those might be written out to swap space. That would mean that they are committed to permanent storage at least for a while even not in the presence of an active attacker. This can be largely mitigated by either disabling swap entirely, or running swap encrypted with a random encryption key, which makes the swap inaccessible after a reboot (because the decryption key needed to make sense of it is lost when the system RAM is cleared).\n\nI would *imagine* that 7zip is well\\-behaved enough to clear out the password from its command line quickly and then further from its internal variables as soon as it is no longer needed, but things like expanded key schedules might be kept for a longer period of time thus increasing the potential for them being swapped out. Those won't necessarily allow recovery of the password, but they may very well allow recovery of the plaintext from the encrypted archive. A simple `ps axw` issued at just the right moment will show someone who is logged in the password in plain text from the command line, but it isn't *stored* and the window of opportunity is small.\n\nWhen you send the e\\-mail, I presume that it contains the password in clear text form (or something that is easily derived into the corresponding plaintext, such as a Base64 encoded message body). **That e\\-mail almost certainly *will* be temporarily written to the system's mail queue**, which means that the password does end up on disk (unless you have the mail queue directory on a RAM disk, which besides the fact that the mail queue is supposed to be on persistent storage presents its own set of problems operationally). Especially if you are running a smarthost setup the queue file will likely be deleted very soon afterwards, but since it has been written to disk, \"the damage is done\" so to speak. Something like `strings /dev/sd?` on any server the mail passes through will probably recover the password to anyone who knows what to look for unless you take specific steps to mitigate this threat.\n\nOf course, e\\-mail in the first place isn't designed to be completely secure. The only way to have reasonable confidentiality assurances with e\\-mail over SMTP (even if you are using SMTP over SSL, or STARTTLS, *throughout the entire chain* of mail servers) is end\\-to\\-end encryption like S/MIME or OpenPGP.\n\n**TL;DR:** Your web application *probably* doesn't deliberately store anywhere the command including the password, or the password itself, but other components it relies on very well might during the course of normal operations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a PHP web application, a randomly generated password is used to encrypt files and then emailed to the user.

I am unsure whether it is appropriate for this venue, but I thought that I would try my luck. Below I have reproduced the question with some modifications.\n\nLet $\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbb{R}^k)$ denote the $k$\\-dimensional Schwartz space with the usual topology, and let $\\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^k)$ denote its strong dual (i.e. the space of tempered distributions equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets).

Now if the duality pairing *were* a continuous map\n$$\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbb{R}^k) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^k) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C},$$\nthen by the universal property of the $\\\\pi$\\-tensor product, we would obtain a unique continuous map\n$$\\\\operatorname{Tr}: \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbb{R}^k) \\\\mathbin{\\\\hat{\\\\otimes}\\_\\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^k) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}$$\nwith the property that $\\\\operatorname{Tr}(f\\\\otimes \\\\bar{g})$ is as above.\n\nUnfortunately, the duality pairing is [not continuous](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2908051/trace-on-mathcals-mathbbrk-hat-otimes-pi-mathcals-mathbb), it is only separately continuous\\-\\-this is a general feature of non\\-normable locally convex spaces.

You can mix wire sizes, but the breaker has to match the smallest wire you used. So if there is any 14g wire on the circuit anywhere, it must have a 15A breaker.\n\nThe electrician that mentioned the fire hazard probably assumed the circuit was covered by a 20A breaker because of the 12g wire so that would be bad since there was also 14g in the wall.\n\nWhen a house is first wired, mixing wire size generally doesn't happen.

According to the documentation, the breaker must match the smallest wire gauge used in the circuit. In this case, since there is 14-gauge wire present, which is rated for 15 amperes, the entire circuit must be protected by a 15-ampere breaker. This is to ensure the safety of the smaller gauge wire, even though 12-gauge wire (which can handle 20 amperes) is also present. The principle is that the breaker should protect the weakest link in the circuit to prevent overheating and potential fire hazards.\n\nOption A (20 amperes) would be incorrect and potentially dangerous, as it would overload the 14-gauge wire.

The concise description is that every formula $\\\\phi(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ is in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ equivalent to a Boolean combination of formulas expressing\n$$\\\\tag1\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:\\\\psi(v\\_p(x\\_1\\),\\\\dots,v\\_p(x\\_k))\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge n,$$\nwhere $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, and $n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$.\n\nIn the special case of formulas in one variable with parameters that you are interested in, this boils down to the following: definable subsets are Boolean combinations of sets defined by\n\n* $v\\_q(x)\\=n$,\n* $v\\_q(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\=n\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\\\ge n,v\\_p(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n\nfor some $q\\\\in\\\\mathbb P$, $n,b\\\\in\\\\omega$, $0\\\\le a\\<m\\<\\\\omega$.\n\nThat all definable relations in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ are equivalent to Boolean combinations of (1\\) follows from the results of Mostowski \\[1]. I will sketch how to prove the other direction, that all sets of the form (1\\) are first\\-order definable.\n\nUsing $\\\\cdot$, we can define the divisibility, coprimeness, and primality predicates as\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}\nx\\\\mid y\\&\\\\iff\\\\exists z\\\\,(y\\=x\\\\cdot z),\\\\\\\\\nx\\\\perp y\\&\\\\iff\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\land z\\\\mid y\\\\to z\\=1\\),\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mr{Prime}(x)\\&\\\\iff x\\\\ne1\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\to z\\=1\\\\lor z\\=x).\n\\\\end{align\\*}$$\nThen, we can define the set of powers of a prime by\n$$\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\perp p\\\\to z\\\\perp x).$$\nFinally, we can define for a given $x$ and a prime $p$ the power of $p$ that appears in the factorization of $x$ by\n$$\\\\mr{Val}(p,x,y)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Power}(p,y)\\\\land\\\\exists z\\\\,(x\\=y\\\\cdot z\\\\land z\\\\perp p).$$\nNow, for each prime $p$, $(\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\},{\\\\cdot})$ is a model of Presburger arithmetic (which I assume to be formulated in a language with just a single binary function symbol $\\+$). Thus, if $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, let $\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ (with an extra free variable $p$) denote the formula of Skolem arithmetic obtained by replacing all occurrences of $\\+$ with $\\\\cdot$, and relativizing all quantifiers to $\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\}$. Then (1\\) is defined by the formula\n$$\\\\exists^{\\\\ge n}p\\\\,(\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\exists y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k\\\\,(\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_1,y\\_1\\)\\\\land\\\\dots\\\\land\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_k,y\\_k)\\\\land\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k))).$$\n\nEDIT: I defined $\\\\psi^p$ for formulas written in the language with $\\+$ only to keep the definition succinct, but in practice, it is more convenient to define it directly for a richer language: specifically, we may translate the constants $0$ and $1$ to $1$ and $p$, respectively, and $x\\\\le y$ to $x\\\\mid y$.\n\nTo put it differently, any Presburger formula $\\\\psi(\\\\vec y)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of integer inequalities $n\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}n\\_iy\\_i\\\\le m\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}m\\_iy\\_i$, and congruences $y\\_i\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$.

When $X$ is $0$ and $Y$ is $0$, that corresponds to the \"most average\" datapoint.\n\nNow, let's say we want to predict $Y$ based on $X$ by doing linear regression on this data\\-set. In other words, we are turning $Y$ into the label we want to predict, and $X$ into the single feature we're predicting it with. \n\nNow, what happens?

However, in this case $\\+b$, the intercept, has absolutely no meaning. It's the label which our model predicts a datapoint would take when $X\\=0$. However, $X$ might correspond to a feature where equaling zero is absolutely senseless! For example, what if $X$ is the height of a newborn baby?\n\nBy centering $X$, the bias now has meaning. Since $X$ is centered, it now takes on a value of $0$ for its average value. That makes the bias, $\\+b$, equal to the $Y$ feature\\-value for the baby with \"the most average height!!!\" Pretty cool!\n\nNow, what if we center the $Y$ labels as well? What happens to the bias \\- what does it represent?\n\nFirst of all, notice what happens to the linear if we center the $Y$ labels.

That was $b$.\n\nNow, when $X'\\=0$, we instead get $b\\-\\\\mu\\_y$. That is, we get the expected difference between the weight of a newborn baby of average height and the average weight of these babies!\n\nNow, for each value of $X'$, what we're getting is the expected difference between the weight of a baby whose height is $X'$ away from the average height and the weight of the baby with the average weight!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a linear regression model, you have centered both the feature X (height of newborn babies) and the label Y (weight of newborn babies).

You probably don't have enough gate drive voltage. Did you even look at the datasheet for the transistor you are using? If you had, you would have seen at what gate voltage it is intended to run at. Something rated for 60 V and 110 A almost certainly requires 12 V or so on the gate to get to the rated RDSON.\n\nWith only partial gate drive of 3\\.3 or 5 V, the effective resistance of the FET is much higher. This causes it to dissipate enough power to heat up to the point of self\\-destruction.\n\n- You don't have a flyback diode across the motor. There should be a diode in reverse across the motor. This is reverse\\-biased and does nothing when the motor is running normally. However, when you turn the motor off, it provides a safe path for the inductive kickback current. Without the diode when you try to switch off the motor, its inductance makes whatever voltage it takes to keep the same current running in the immediate short term. That means abusing the FET to the point where it conducts anyway, even though it is driven to off. That's bad for the FET."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is attempting to control a 48V DC motor using an Arduino and a MOSFET (IRF3205).

Lack of a flyback diode: Without a flyback diode across the motor, the inductive kickback when switching off the motor can damage the MOSFET.\n\n2.

If so, which one would be recommended?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrical characteristics\n--------------------------\n\nYou must consider the maximum characteristics. This includes the maximum DC forward current the display can handle. Maximum reverse voltage should also be noted down as well. 60mA max for 7 segments and 30mA max for the DP.\n\nBy the looks of it, you should be running the 7 segments at 20mA and the DP LED at 10mA to be safe.\n\nForward voltage should also be taken into consideration. You should be powering this display from a 12 volt supply since the forward voltage **CAN BE** (Vf is not consistent as it varies at different currents, make show you don't blow up the LED by overestimating the forward voltage!!! Read below to see what I mean by overestimating since in the formula of determining the series resistor, the Vf deducts the supply voltage.) a whopping 7\\.8V (DP is 3\\.9V) where it can increase all the way to 10V (DP is 5V).\n\nNow lastly, it's using those values. You need these values in order to know what resistor to use. However it's not that simple. The forward voltage changes at different forward currents. Check the [datasheet](http://www.produktinfo.conrad.com/datenblaetter/1000000-1099999/001050584-da-01-en-LED_ANZEIGE_7_SEG__ROT_SC40_19SURKWA.pdf) and look at the graph that shows the relation between them.\n\nNow calculate on [here](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/led-resistor-calculator) and you get your resistor value.\n\nWould an Arduino Leonardo suffice?\n----------------------------------\n\nCurrently with your method, it will *just* work since the Leonardo has 20 pins capable of outputting IO and you would omit pin 13 which is already connected to an LED and 1 and 2 since they're connected to Tx and Rx. However you can shave some pins down. Since you're going to be lighting the LED's one by one at a fast rate to give the illusion that they're all on at once, you can shave the 9 pins for each segment display into 4, saving 5 pins. This means you'll have more space for other stuff. You don't have to do this though otherwise you would need a BCD (or 4bit binary) to decade decoder IC.\n\nNeed any driver IC's?\n---------------------\n\nYes and no. Since your arduino runs at 5V and you would be driving the LED display at a much higher voltage, you would need to drive them. You could use a whole lot of PNP transistors and resistors in series with each base in addition to the resistors in series with the LEDs to drive them, or supplement the individual transistors together with a PNP transistor array IC which makes things a lil bit more organised.\n\nAnd if you're shaving these 9 pins into 4, you would need a BCD to decimal decoder as you're driving with binary this way."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are designing a 9-digit 7-segment LED display using an Arduino Leonardo.

Using 12 I/O pins (4 for digit selection, 8 for segments) allows for efficient multiplexing and saves pins on the Arduino Leonardo.\n2. A BCD to decimal decoder IC is mentioned in the documentation as a way to reduce the number of pins needed for digit selection.\n3. A PNP transistor array is suggested for driving the LEDs, as the Arduino's 5V output is insufficient for the high forward voltage of the LEDs.\n4. A 12V power supply is recommended in the documentation, as the forward voltage of the LEDs can be up to 7.8V (or even 10V in some cases).\n5. Current-limiting resistors are necessary to protect the LEDs and ensure proper operation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the high forward voltage of the LEDs and lacks necessary driving components.

After a weak learner is added,\n> the data weights are readjusted, known as \"re\\-weighting\".\n> Misclassified input data gain a higher weight and examples that are\n> classified correctly lose weight.\\[note 1] Thus, future weak learners\n> focus more on the examples that previous weak learners misclassified.\n\nHowever, in [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), I do not see any reference of *training instance re\\-weighting* being mentioned. Also, there is no such parameter in the implementation on [Scikit\\-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor).\n\nI do see a parameter called *learning rate*, that combines subsequent models, however, that seems to be fixed and not adjustable for each subsequent model.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On generic gradient boosting you'd be able to as Menhmet Suzen put it out but even the gradient tree boosting coming from the generic algorithm they are not the same even if the weak learner $h$ is a regression tree. Friedman (2001\\) makes a change on gradient tree boosting which is to optimise the tree's output.\n\nSo the model updating from generic algorithm:\n\n$F\\_m(x)\\=F\\_{m\\-1}(x)\\+\\\\rho\\_m h\\_m(x)$\n\nis switched by:\n\n$F\\_m(x)\\=F\\_{m\\-1}(x)\\+h\\_m(x)$\n\nwhere:\n\n$h\\_m(x)\\=\\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^{J\\_m}\\\\hat{b}\\_{jm}I(x \\\\in R\\_{jm})$, $R\\_{jm}$ as the $j$\\-th terminal node of the $m$\\-th tree and $\\\\hat{b}\\_{jm}$ its optimized output.\n\nThis approach has come from optimizing $b\\_{jm}\\=\\\\rho\\_m \\\\gamma\\_{jm}$ ($\\\\gamma\\_{jm}$ also as a tree output) is better than optimizing $\\\\rho\\_m$ and $\\\\gamma\\_{jm}$ separately\nbecause the first one is a one dimensional optimization.\n\nFinally there is a another change has been done to prevent overfitting which is to put a learning rate $\\\\alpha$ on model update:\n\n$F\\_m(x)\\=F\\_{m\\-1}(x)\\+\\\\alpha h\\_m(x)$\n\nAs the weights and trees are actually the same thing I think the \"re\\-adjusting weights\" interpretation would make you confuse on gradient tree boosting algorithm. It would still make sense on generic algorithm, as I showed, but almost no one use gradient boosting without using trees as weak learners. There still is a pretty cool interpretation on gradient tree boosting, you can look that as additive algorithm where a update $F\\_m$ fix the residuals of previous model $F\\_{m\\-1}$ since $h\\_m$ is fitted to residuals (it's actually fitted to pseudo residuals but for quadratic loss they are the same) and then added to $F\\_{m\\-1}$ in order to attempt \"undo\" the errors generated by $F\\_{m\\-1}$, furthermore you can look at the learning $\\\\alpha$ as a cap to the 'model fixing' for prevent overfitting.\n\nAnswering your main question a boosting algorithm is any model that fits a additive expansion like that:\n\n$f(x)\\=\\\\sum\\_{m\\=1}^{M} \\\\beta\\_m f(x,\\\\theta\\_m)$\n\nor a tree expansion:\n\n$f(x)\\=\\\\sum\\_{m\\=1}^{M}\\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^{J\\_m}{b}\\_{jm}I(x \\\\in R\\_{jm})$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key difference between traditional boosting algorithms and gradient tree boosting as proposed by Friedman (2001)?\n\nA) Traditional boosting re-weights training instances, while gradient tree boosting does not use any form of weighting.\n\nB) Gradient tree boosting optimizes the tree's output directly, while traditional boosting focuses on adjusting the learning rate.\n\nC) Traditional boosting uses a fixed learning rate, while gradient tree boosting uses an adaptive learning rate for each iteration.\n\nD) Gradient tree boosting fits weak learners to pseudo-residuals, while traditional boosting fits weak learners to the original target variable.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key difference highlighted in the passage is that Friedman's gradient tree boosting algorithm optimizes the tree's output directly, rather than separately optimizing a scaling factor (\u03c1) and the tree output (\u03b3) as in more traditional boosting approaches. This is represented by the change from F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \u03c1_m h_m(x) to F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + h_m(x), where h_m(x) includes optimized output values for each tree node.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while traditional boosting does re-weight instances, the passage doesn't state that gradient tree boosting completely abandons weighting concepts.\n\nOption C is incorrect because both approaches can use a fixed learning rate (\u03b1 in gradient tree boosting).\n\nOption D, while partially true about gradient boosting fitting to pseudo-residuals, doesn't capture the main distinction described in the passage and isn't presented as the key difference from traditional boosting."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/12/24", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/521715", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/32623/"], "docs_id": 521715, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to hatch the region inside the rectangle, but outside the ellipses.

You'll probably extend this from `Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List`. In this block, create a method\n\n```\n/**\n * Gets the configurable options template if needed\n *\n * @param Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product\n * @return string\n */\npublic function getConfigurableHtml(Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product)\n{\n    if ($product->getTypeId() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable::TYPE_CODE) {\n        return Mage::app()->getLayout()\n        ->createBlock('modulename/catalog_product_view_type_configurable')\n            ->setProduct($product)\n            ->setTemplate('modulename/catalog/product/list/configurable.phtml')\n            ->toHtml();\n    }\n    return '';\n}\n\n```\n\nGo ahead and use a layout update to set the template to modulename/catalog/product/list.phtml as well.\n\nIn your list template (copied from base/default) you need to get the configurable html with our new method. You also need to wrap it in a form (make sure the add to cart button is in there). There should be a product collection somewhere (one for list mode, the other for grid)\n\n```\n<?php foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): ?>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $this->getSubmitUrl($_product) ?>\" method=\"post\" id=\"product_addtocart_form_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\"<?php if($_product->getOptions()): ?> enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"<?php endif; ?>>\n        <?php echo $this->getConfigurableHtml($_product) ?>\n        <?php echo $this->getPriceHtml($_product, true) ?>\n        <?php if($_product->isSaleable()): ?>\n            <p><button type=\"button\" title=\"<?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?>\" class=\"button btn-cart\" onclick=\"setLocation('<?php echo $this->getAddToCartUrl($_product) ?>')\"><span><span><?php echo $this->__('Add to Cart') ?></span></span></button></p>\n        <?php else: ?>\n            <p class=\"availability out-of-stock\"><span><?php echo $this->__('Out of stock') ?></span></p>\n        <?php endif; ?>\n    </form>\n<?php endforeach ?>\n\n```\n\nNow create your configurable block and phtml (as defined in `getConfigurableHtml()` above)\n\nIn your configurable block, override `getJsonConfig()` to add a container class (each must be unique)\n\n```\nclass Namespace_Modulename_Block_Catalog_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n    extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Type_Configurable\n{\n    /**\n     * Composes configuration for js\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function getJsonConfig()\n    {\n        $config = Mage::helper('core')->jsonDecode(parent::getJsonConfig());\n        $config['containerId'] = 'configurable-container-' . $this->getProduct()->getId();\n        return Mage::helper('core')->jsonEncode($config);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd now in your `configurable.phtml`, create the select boxes, load the json config, and add your container class\n\n```\n<?php\n$_product    = $this->getProduct();\n$_attributes = Mage::helper('core')->decorateArray($this->getAllowAttributes());\n?>\n<?php if ($_product->isSaleable() && count($_attributes)):?>\n    <dl id=\"configurable-container-<?php echo $_product->getId() ?>\">\n    <?php foreach($_attributes as $_attribute): ?>\n        <div class=\"option-wrapper\">\n            <dt class=\"title-wrap\"><label class=\"required\"><?php echo $_attribute->getLabel() ?></label></dt>\n            <dd class=\"option-wrap\">\n                <div class=\"input-box\">\n                    <select name=\"super_attribute[<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>]\" id=\"attribute<?php echo $_attribute->getAttributeId() ?>\" class=\"modulename-super-attribute-select\">\n                        <option><?php echo $this->__('Choose an Option...') ?></option>\n                    </select>\n                    <div class=\"options-arrow\"><img src=\"<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/option-arrow.png');?>\" alt=\"<?php echo $this->__('option arrow');?>\"/></div>\n                  </div>\n            </dd>\n        </div>\n    <?php endforeach; ?>\n    </dl>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var spConfig_<?php echo $_product->getId() ?> = new ModulenameProduct.Config(<?php echo $this->getJsonConfig() ?>);\n    </script>\n<?php endif;?>\n\n```\n\nNotice a few other things. The `modulename-super-attribute-select` classname on the the select, the uniquely named javascript var, and the custom `Product.Config()`. In all honesty, I was getting a little stuck, so this last part isn't pretty but it should work.\n\nCreate and include a JS file via layout update. What I did was copy and paste the `Product.Config` object here (copied from `js/varien/configurable.js`) because I was having trouble extending it. There was only one thing that needed changing \n\n```\nvar ModulenameProduct = {};\nModulenameProduct.Config = Class.create();\nModulenameProduct.Config.prototype = {\n    initialize: function(config){\n        this.config     = config;\n        this.taxConfig  = this.config.taxConfig;\n        if (config.containerId) {\n            // Add our special classname for the select to it doesn't conflict\n            this.settings   = $$('#' + config.containerId + ' ' + '.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        } else {\n            // here too\n            this.settings   = $$('.modulename-super-attribute-select');\n        }\n        this.state      = new Hash();\n        this.priceTemplate = new Template(this.config.template);\n        this.prices     = config.prices;\n    // ...\n\n```\n\nAnd that should do it.

Explanation with diagrams clarifying the practical and conceptual differences would be very much appreciated. How does the variable being stochastic make any difference? Why can't we use regular Machine Learning techniques for time series?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Auto\\-regressive models (ARIMA) use previous values as predictors depending upon the form of the model and forecasts are adaptive in form generally responding to previous values. Models using time as a predictor can be understood as using previous values to estimate the model parameters (thus previous values do come into play ) but they are otherwise not part of the forecast equation thus being generally non\\-adaptive or fixed until re\\-estimation occurs. Models using time or time\\-squared or time\\-cubed etc. are anachronistic and generally not used/preferred except in very simple textbooks and in very simple classroom exercises. Models using time variables will generally exhibit auto\\-correlated residuals thus should be studiously avoided as the presumed model. However my work usually includes/investigates both procedures as tentative/possible approaches since only the data knows which approach is better or which approach delivers a more efficient model. \n\nResponse to comment @Veneeth :\n\nI didn't say less accurate I wrote (implied) different. A time based model predicts based upon the input variable/series 1,2,3,3,...t which means that the prediction for t\\+2 ,t\\+ 3 , t\\+ 4 is fixed or deterministic or unchanged because when you observe y(t\\+1\\) as it was before you observed y(t\\+1\\). The new value has no effect on the prediction if you don't re\\-estimate parameters while a model that uses the value of y(t\\+1\\) et. al. and is ARIMA based will provide different forecasts. If you use the time predictor approach and re\\-estimate with y(t\\+1\\) in addition to all the previous y's the impact of the new observation will be normally minimal on the model coefficients unless the sample size is very small or the new observation is an anomaly which should be identified and neutralized.\n\nSince @Veneeth asked for a quantitative example , I attempt here to answer that.\nWith apologies to Charles Dickens one could entitle this as \" A tale of three approaches\" I selected a real world example not a trivial textbook example which emphasizes the impact of presumption when it comes to model identification .

The key difference highlighted in the documentation is that ARIMA models are adaptive and use previous values of the time series as predictors, allowing forecasts to change based on new observations. In contrast, time-based regression models use time as a predictor and are generally non-adaptive, with forecasts remaining fixed until the model is re-estimated with new data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation doesn't state that time-based models are always more accurate.

This geometric approach, using the space defined over the configuration space of points in \u03a3\u00d7\u211d, could simultaneously handle both \"convolution\" and \"fusion\" in the affine Grassmannian.

The extreme temperature fluctuations, particularly the reading of 230\u00b0C, are highly unlikely to be accurate. As mentioned in the top answer, a GPU temperature of 230\u00b0C would be nearly hot enough to melt tin and would cause immediate failure and noticeable burning smells. The rapid changes between very high, very low, and impossible temperatures suggest a software glitch in SpeedFan rather than actual temperature readings. While improper application of thermal paste (option B) could cause temperature issues, it wouldn't result in such extreme and rapidly changing readings.

This is important because a user would be shown a bad SSL cert warning if they access <https://mydomain.com>. If they proceed, they then get redirect to 'www'.\n\nSSL forcing is working, redirecting to 'www' subdomain is working, I just need to do the redirect first.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nPer Nathan's Comment:\n\nI had an imperfect solution.

I don't use it myself. On a VPS deployment, you'd just add the redirect on your forward\\-facing web server (Apache, nginx) before it even hit the middleware. This seems like a common case, so I imagine Heroku might have something there for you.\n\nFor the former, it shouldn't be hard. The rack\\-ssl middleware is very, very simple, and it shouldn't be hard to monkeypatch it to suit your needs.\n\n[https://github.com/josh/rack\\-ssl/blob/master/lib/rack/ssl.rb\\#L58](https://github.com/josh/rack-ssl/blob/master/lib/rack/ssl.rb#L58)\n\nI imagine that something like `url.host = \"www.myhost.com\"` might be what you'd want (although you can probably tell there are probably more FQDN\\-agnostic ways to do it)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When deploying a Rails application on Heroku with SSL requirements, which approach would most effectively handle both SSL forcing and www subdomain redirection while avoiding SSL certificate warnings?\n\nA) Implement SSL forcing in the Rails application controller and www redirection in the routes.rb file.\n\nB) Use Heroku's built-in SSL add-on and configure DNS settings to always point to www subdomain.\n\nC) Modify the rack-ssl middleware to handle both SSL forcing and www redirection before the request reaches the application.\n\nD) Implement SSL forcing using Rails middleware and handle www redirection at the web server level (e.g., Apache or Nginx).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is insufficient because it doesn't solve the issue of SSL certificate warnings when accessing the non-www domain.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Heroku's SSL add-on alone doesn't handle www redirection, and DNS settings can't fully solve this issue.\n\nOption C is the most effective solution because it addresses both SSL forcing and www redirection at the middleware level, before the request reaches the application. This approach can prevent SSL certificate warnings and ensure proper redirection.\n\nOption D, while a valid approach for some deployments, is not applicable to Heroku, as users don't have direct access to configure the web server.\n\nThe correct answer (C) involves modifying the rack-ssl middleware, which allows for handling both SSL forcing and www redirection early in the request cycle, effectively solving the issue of SSL certificate warnings and ensuring proper redirection to the www subdomain."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/05", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/452744", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/224576/"], "docs_id": 452744, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm wondering what are continuous distributions that are additive and have finite support. Joint normal distribution is continuous, and is additive in the sense that if $X,Y$ are joint normal, then $X\\+Y$ are still normal, but they have infinite support (on the real line). I want something that is continuous, additive and has finite support. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **A minimal example** is obtained by taking literally *any* distribution with compact support on the nonnegative reals. Letting $F$ be its cumulative distribution function, this means there exist $0\\\\le a\\\\le b$ for which $F(a)\\=0$ and $F(b)\\=1\\.$ Repeated convolution produces the sequence of distribution functions $F\\_n,$ $n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots,$ for which $F\\_1 \\= F$ and for all $n\\\\ge 1,$\n\n$$F\\_{n\\+1}(x) \\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} F\\_n(x\\-y)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} F(y).$$\n\nBecause this corresponds to addition of random variables, the support of $F\\_n$ is contained in the interval $\\[na,nb],$ which is compact and non\\-negative.\n\nWhen $X\\_n$ is a random variable with distribution $F\\_n$ and $X\\_m$ a random variable with distribution $F\\_m,$ this ensures that $X\\_n\\+X\\_m$ has distribution $F\\_{n\\+m},$ showing this family $(F\\_n)$ is closed under addition. Its parameter is $n.$ When $F$ is a continuous distribution, so is $F\\_n.$ Thus, **$(F\\_n)$ satisfies all the requirements of the question.**\n\nAt <https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/43075/919> I describe such a family explicitly (and in great detail) where $F$ is the Uniform$(0,1\\)$ distribution. This shows that **the construction of $(F\\_n)$ is not just an abstraction:** it can lead to distributions with computable formulas and concrete applications.\n\n---\n\nIt might be objected that $n$ can attain only integral values. We can try to fix that. If there were such a family associated with all positive real $n$ it would be *infinitely divisible:* for all $n,$ the distribution $F\\_n$ could be expressed as the convolution of $F\\_{n/2}$ with itself, or generally the $k$\\-fold convolution of $F\\_{n/k}$ for any whole number $k.$ The [Wikipedia article on infinite divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_divisibility_(probability)) asserts that apart from atomic distributions (which concentrate all probability on a single value), **there exist no infinitely divisible family of distributions with \"bounded (finite) support.\"** It does not prove this, but refers to Sato, Ken\\-iti (1999\\), *L\u00e9vy Processes and Infinitely Divisible Distributions* for the details.\n\n**The minimal example can, however, be enlarged by adding in other distributions.** For instance, by adding in any atomic distribution supported on a non\\-negative value $\\\\mu$ we can introduce a *location parameter.* In effect, writing\n\n$$F\\_{n;\\\\mu}(x) \\= F\\_n(x\\-\\\\mu)$$\n\nwe create a two\\-parameter family where the parameter $n$ must be a whole number and $\\\\mu$ can be any non\\-negative real number. These distributions are supported on the intervals $\\[na\\+\\\\mu,nb\\+\\\\mu]$ which are non\\-negative and compact. For corresponding random variables $X\\_{n;\\\\nu}$ and $X\\_{m;\\\\mu},$ clearly $$X\\_{n;\\\\nu}\\+X\\_{m;\\\\mu}$$ has $F\\_{m\\+n;\\\\mu\\+\\\\nu}$ for its distribution. Thus, the family $$(F\\_{n;\\\\mu}),\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, \\\\mu \\\\ge 0$$ satisfies the condition of the question.\n\n**We can generate larger families very generally by emulating this process of combining two families of distributions under addition.** When $(G\\_n)$ is also an additively closed family of distributions with non\\-negative compact support, then for any pairs of whole numbers $m$ and $n$ let $H\\_{m,n}$ be the distribution of $X\\_m\\+Y\\_n$ where $X\\_m\\\\sim F\\_m$ and $Y\\_n\\\\sim G\\_n.$ The family $(H\\_{m,n},\\\\, m\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots;\\\\, n\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots)$ satisfies all the conditions of the question. This process can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n**In a specific sense, *all* solutions to this problem arise in this way.** When $\\\\mathcal F$ is any set of distributions with compact non\\-negative support, define the \"additive closure\" of $\\\\mathcal F$ to be the intersection of all sets of distributions that are additively closed and include $\\\\mathcal F.$ This intersection exists because the set of *all* distributions is one such set. All additively closed families obviously equal their own additive closures. As we noted before, the only distributions in $\\\\mathcal F$ that can be infinitely divisible would have to be atomic."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about continuous distributions that are additive and have finite support is correct?\n\nA) The normal distribution satisfies all these properties.\n\nB) There exists an infinitely divisible family of such distributions for all positive real parameters.\n\nC) A minimal example can be constructed using any distribution with compact support on the nonnegative reals.\n\nD) It's impossible to construct a family of such distributions with more than one parameter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while the normal distribution is continuous and additive, it has infinite support.\n\nB is incorrect.

(As already commented by basics) But ok, limiting to a special case should still yield the desired result, so that's not it.~~ Silly me.\n\nNo. 2 is that you are missing the assumption of a linear medium that is usually used in deriving the integral $\\\\int \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\\\,\\\\text{d}V$ for the energy. In a Lagrangian formalism (and you might do the same with energy) the dielectric displacement is the conjugate quantity to the electric field, i.e. given a Lagrangian density $\\\\mathcal{L}$ we have\n$$\nD\\_i \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial E\\_i}\\\\,.\n$$\nFor a linear isotropic medium, with the free\\-field Lagrangian being\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2\n$$\nyou will find that $\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}$ and thus indeed\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E}\\\\,.\n$$\nIn a nonlinear model this is not generally true, for example for the electrostatic Heisenberg\\-Euler Lagrangian\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\n($E\\_0$ being some arbitrary constant field)\nyou will find that\n$$\n\\\\vec{D} \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\+ 2 \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\n$$\nand subsequently\n$$\n\\\\mathcal{L} \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{D} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} \\- \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}^2}{E\\_0^2}\\\\,.\n$$\n\n**No. 3, the main point, is that you are starting with a wrong formula for the field energy.** The integral\n$$\nW \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int \\\\varepsilon\\_0 \\\\vec{E}^2 \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\n$$\nis the energy of a collection of charges in vacuum, which you for example obtain by bringing each charge into position one after the other from infinity and calculating the work you do each time. You cannot use this for the energy in a continuous medium because when building up the charge distribution in the medium you also do some internal work to move the polarization charges that is not accounted for in the above formula for $W$. What you do instead is consider the infinitesimal change of energy when changing the density of free charges by $\\\\delta \\\\rho$,\n$$\n\\\\delta W \\= \\\\int \\\\delta\\\\rho \\\\phi \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\\\\,.\n$$\nThrough $\\\\delta \\\\rho \\= \\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\vec{D}\\\\right)$ and partial integration you obtain\n$$\n\\\\delta W \\= \\\\int \\\\vec{E} \\\\cdot \\\\delta \\\\vec{D} \\\\,\\\\text{d}V\\\\,\n$$\nand work your way onwards from there.

So I would really appreciate if someone could explain to me what is going on here:\n\n* What is the intention of the `\\nhphantom` macro?\n* What does `\\sbox0` do?\n* What does `\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` do?\n\nI would also like to understand why the starred version of the `mathtools` commands don't work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TeX has something called a *box*, which is what it uses to organize things in the document. Knuth's TeX has 256 box registers for you to use. Think of that as 256 actual boxes available for TeX to store things and then use them in the document.\n\nThe command `\\sbox0{#1}` puts the contents of `#1` in the box register n\u00b0 `0`.\n\nNow that the box register `0` has `#1` you can do things with this box, like measure its width with `\\wd`, height with `\\ht`, and depth with `\\dp`, so `\\wd0` returns the with of the contents of the box `0`.\n\nSo, breaking apart the `\\nhphantom` macro:\n\n```\n% Store the contents of #1 into box register 0\n\\sbox0{#1}%\n% Go back -0.751 times the \\wd of the box register 0\n\\hspace{-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0 \\relax}\n\n```\n\nAlso, as egreg said in the comments, `-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` is redundant. The `\\the` will get the text representation of `\\wd0`, then the `\\dimexpr` will read this text back into a number. You can skip this back\\-and\\-forth with `-0.751\\wd0`, so you can simplify to:\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[1]{\\sbox0{#1}\\hspace{-0.751\\wd0}}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThis register principle is what makes up TeX's memory. TeX has:\n\n* `\\count` registers to hold counters (integers);\n* `\\dimen` registers to hold lengths;\n* `\\skip` registers to hold glue (one dimen plus another minus one more);\n* `\\muskip` registers to hold muglue (for maths);\n* `\\box` registers to hold boxes; and\n* `\\toks` registers to hold lists of tokens.\n\n---\n\nAs for your question about the starred versions (which I saw only now, sorry)...\n\nThe `\\sbox0{#1}` in the `\\nhphantom` macro saves the contents of `#1` in an `\\hbox`, which is *not* in math mode, thus you have to call `\\nhphantom` with `$...$` to enforce math mode. But this creates a math mode in text mode in math mode thing, which makes TeX \"forget\" about the rest of the equation it is in.\n\nWhen you use a starred version of a delimiter created by `\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX`, you make the outer delimiters be `\\left<delim>` and `\\right<delim>`, and the `\\delimsize` becomes `\\middle` to be used safely between `\\left` and `\\right`. The problem is that the math\\-in\\-text\\-in\\-math thing makes TeX forget about the surrounding `\\left` and `\\right` and the argument of `\\nhphantom` is `$\\middle\\lbrack$`, which is invalid because you cannot use `\\middle` without an enclosing `\\left...\\right`.\n\nTo workaround this issue I changed the `\\nhphantom` macro a little. It now has two arguments: the delimiter and the content in between. The `\\nhphantom` macro then measures the width of `\\left<delim>\\vphantom{#1}\\right.`, which is valid.\n\nHere is the complete working code:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\usepackage{mathtools}\n\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbrackets}[1]{\\lbrack}{\\rbrack}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrack}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrack \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrack \\nhphantom{\\rbrack}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbraces}[1]{\\lbrace}{\\rbrace}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrace}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrace \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrace \\nhphantom{\\rbrace}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dparens}[1]{\\lparen}{\\rparen}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lparen}{#1} \\delimsize\\lparen \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rparen \\nhphantom{\\rparen}{#1}\n}\n\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[2]{\\sbox0{$\\left#1\\vphantom{#2}\\right.$}\\hspace{-0.58\\wd0}}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n$\\dbrackets[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n\n%These do work :)\n\n$\\dbrackets*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens*{\\frac12}$\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the \\nhphantom macro in the given LaTeX code?\n\nA) To create a visible placeholder of a specific width\nB) To generate a negative horizontal space based on the width of its argument\nC) To store content in a box register for later use\nD) To enforce math mode for delimiters\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe \\nhphantom macro is designed to create a negative horizontal space based on the width of its argument.

The energy from Speaker A at this new position would be 2500 times greater than the energy from Speaker B, despite being twice as far away."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/279030", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/115149/"], "docs_id": 279030, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have many (at the moment around 30\\) different message classes in an application I am creating. Each of these messages need to be serialized and deserialized. However, the process of serializing and deserializing is mostly unique to each class (the format of the serialized message is specified in a document, and says which bits in the message goes where), but some are pretty straight forward and use the same process.\n\nI thought about having each of them implement an interface, with `Serialize()` and `Deserialize()` methods. However, it seems cumbersome to implement this for each message, especially when many of the messages do in fact use the same code to do this serializing and deserializing. \n\nI thought about having a class that contains a `Dictionary<T, Func<IMessage, byte[]>`, and a function to map a function to serialize to a specific type.

How would you go about this problem? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sounds like you can cover this using straight\\-forward inheritance.

Some message types share common serialization logic, while others require unique implementations.

By using an abstract base class with virtual methods, you can provide a default implementation for common serialization logic. Specific message types can then inherit from this base class and override the methods only when necessary, reducing code duplication and allowing for easy extension of the system with new message types. This approach combines the benefits of polymorphism and code reuse, making it more flexible and easier to maintain than the other options presented.\n\nOption A would lead to unnecessary code duplication for message types that share common serialization logic. Option B, while flexible, could become unwieldy with a large number of message types and doesn't leverage object-oriented principles as effectively.

The present perfect tense (\"Have you phoned...\") typically emphasizes the current relevance or result of a past action, without specifying when it occurred. It creates a link between the past and the present. The simple past tense (\"Did you phone...\") focuses more on the action happening at a specific point in the past, without necessarily connecting it to the present moment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the implication of expectation is not a consistent feature of the present perfect tense.

I live in eastern Massachusetts where it has recently been in the teens and 20s for low temps in winter.\nI have a large crawl space under my kitchen and 3 season porch ranging in height from 1' to 4' with no venting to the outside. I recently air\\-sealed the entire rim joist with an expanding foam and added a heavy mil plastic sheeting over the dirt floor, making sure to overlap and seal all edges. We also insulated the copper pipes in the space with closed cell insulation tubing and taped all joints to prevent the pipes from freezing. The kitchen is still very cold.  \n\nI would like to ideally insulate the space in between the floor joists and possibly the exterior brick foundation walls but are getting conflicting info on what to do. \n\n* Could use a poly spray foam kit, but the max R\\-values I have seen are only in the 7\\-10 range and its not anywhere close to warm enough outside to prevent it from failing. Everything I read says not to use apply when below 60 degrees or it will not cure properly. Its barely in the 30s right now! Also, the exterior walls are not all that clean and the foam might not stick.\n* Floor joists are not evenly spaced and range from 17\"OC to 22\"OC so batt insulation is going to be a pain.\n* Could use blown\\-in insulation but how do I get it to stay up there? Someone told me to use a plastic sheeting across all the joists with furring strips for extra support and then simply blow the insulation into each joist cavity, but I am worried that the plastic sheeting is too much of a vapor barrier and will cause mold inside the joist cavities. If the crawl space is already moisture sealed, am I OK? Do I need some sort of barrier up inside the cavities on the bottom of the floor?\n\nAlso, do I really need to insulate the brick foundation walls and will this show a big difference? Because the dirt is not evenly distributed and some areas are tight to get into, getting rigid foam board would be nearly impossible. \n\nPlease help!!!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am also in the Northeast and have had to tackle this type of situation a few times. There are several ways to attack it. \n\nIn your case, the best solution, but unfortunately the most expensive would be to use an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays. They are fairly easy to use and give you about an R\\-4 rating per inch. They are a two tank kit with a hose and wand.\n Here is an example product: [Touch N Seal 1000 Kit Open Cell Spray Foam Insulation](http://www.betterenergystore.com/productpage.asp?p=624&gclid=COb_3t_VnLUCFcuZ4Aod1BkAIw)\n\nThese type of kits start around $400, depending on the square footage and depth required.\n\nA cheaper method would be to use 24 inch R\\-19 unfaced blanket insulation cut to your custom widths. You can use wire springs to hold it in place and keep it from falling. I would then cover the entire area with 4 to 6 mil plastic, stapled to all the joists. Tape the joints, if any. Moisture should not be a major problem since you have already done what sounds like a good job sealing the dirt floor. In the summer months, some ventilation in the crawl space will also help avoid excess moisture.\n\nRigid foam glued to the foundation walls would also help if the area is fairly air tight. If there is free air flow, insulating the brick walls would be a waste of time and money."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When insulating a crawl space in a cold climate like Massachusetts, which of the following methods is recommended as the best solution according to the expert, despite being the most expensive?\n\nA) Using R-19 unfaced blanket insulation cut to custom widths and held in place with wire springs\nB) Applying closed-cell spray foam insulation when temperatures are above 60\u00b0F\nC) Using an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays\nD) Blowing in loose-fill insulation and containing it with plastic sheeting\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe expert states that \"the best solution, but unfortunately the most expensive would be to use an open cell foam kit to fill the joist bays.\" They mention it's easy to use, provides about R-4 per inch, and can be applied with a two-tank kit with a hose and wand.
