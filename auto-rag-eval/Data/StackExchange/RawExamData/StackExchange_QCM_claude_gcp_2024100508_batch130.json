Since it's not mine, I want to be as careful as I can. I'll follow the procedure exactly as Apple recommends, and the device has never been jailbroken.

A categorical variable with four levels is *represented* by three dummy variables. Those three dummys *together* represents one variable, and should be treated as such. To do that with the lasso, use the *group lasso*, as discussed in [Why use group lasso instead of lasso?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/214325/why-use-group-lasso-instead-of-lasso). \n\nThere are many posts about the group lasso [in here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=group+lasso+answers%3A1)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is performing variable selection using Lasso regression on a dataset with both numerical and categorical predictors. One categorical predictor has four levels. After running the Lasso, only one level of this categorical predictor is selected. What is the most appropriate interpretation and next step?\n\nA) This is the correct way to use Lasso. The selected level is the only important one, and the other levels can be disregarded.\n\nB) This indicates a problem with the data. The categorical variable should be re-coded or removed from the analysis.\n\nC) This is an expected outcome of Lasso and represents a form of Analysis of Covariance. No further action is needed.\n\nD) This suggests that standard Lasso is not appropriate for this situation. The data scientist should consider using group Lasso instead to properly handle the categorical variable.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The standard Lasso algorithm treats each level of a categorical variable independently, which can lead to inconsistent selection of levels within a single categorical predictor. This is not the ideal approach for handling categorical variables with multiple levels. The group Lasso is specifically designed to handle grouped variables, such as the dummy variables that represent a single categorical predictor. It allows for the selection or exclusion of all levels of a categorical variable together, which is more appropriate for maintaining the integrity of the categorical predictor in the model. Therefore, switching to group Lasso would be the most appropriate next step to properly handle the four-level categorical variable in this variable selection process."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/17", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20037233", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2521511/"], "docs_id": 20037233, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My central block keeps on moving to the left when I resize the browser window\n\nnormal:\n\n<http://imgur.com/b2AVkUx>\n\nafter resizing browser window:\n\n<http://imgur.com/mJq6AuO>\n\nso i managed to figure out how to keep the navi and footer relatively undisruptive during resizing, but I just can't seem to figure out how to deal with the body, help please? \n\nHTML:\n\n```\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Line After Line</title>\n    <link type = \"text/css\" rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"stylesheet.css\"/>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"script.js\"></script>\n\n</head> \n\n<body>\n    <div id = \"top\">\n        <div id = \"opening\">\n            <a href = \"index.html\">\n                <h1 id = \"logo\"> Line After Line </h1>\n            </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div id = \"navi\">\n            <ul>\n                <li> Read </li>\n                <li> Write</li>\n                <li> Review </li>\n                <li> Donate </li>\n\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div id = \"updates\">\n        <h4>Updates</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li> number one blah blah blah blah blah hahahahaahah </li>\n                </br>\n            <li>number two blah blah blah </li>\n        </ul>       \n    </div>  \n\n    <div id = \"story\">\n        <a href = \"blockOne.html\">\n            <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockOne\" >\n                <p> Hello I this is a test block </p>\n            </div>\n        </a>\n\n        <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockTwo\"></div>\n        <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockThree\"></div>\n        <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockFour\"></div>\n        <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockFive\"></div>\n        <div class = \"storyblocks\" id = \"blockSix\"></div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div id = \"footer\">\n        <ul>\n            <li> Home </li>\n            <li> A Message From Chung</li>\n            <li> Contributors </li>\n            <li> About </li>\n            <li> Contact </li>\n\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n</body>\n\n```\n\nCSS: \n\n```\n    *{\n    margin: 0px;\n    padding: 0px;\n    }\n    ul{\n    list-style-type: none;\n    }\n\n    body{\n    background-color: white;

How can I restrict a particular application from accessing certain private files, while still allowing the files to be accessed by other applications using AppArmor on openSUSE.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: AppArmor is a [Mandatory Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control \"Wikipedia article on Mandatory Access Control\") (MAC) [Linux Security Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules \"Wikipedia article on Linux Security Modules\") (LSM), used by, amongst other, Ubuntu and SUSE Linux. AppArmor access control rules are defined in AppArmor profiles in `/etc/apparmor.d/`. The profiles are simply text files, which contain information regarding resources the application the profile pertains is allowed to access.\n\nTypically, when [designing profiles](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Profiling_by_hand \"AppArmor Wiki: Profiling by hand\"), one would exercise the application with AppArmor set to `complain` mode, in which access control violations are allowed, but logged. Using the logs, one would iteratively refine the profile. When the profile is done, AppArmor can be switched to `enforce` mode, in which the access control rules defined in the profile are enforced, and any violation attempts logged.\n\nThe outline of an AppArmor profile looks like this:\n\n```\n#include <tunables/global>\n/path/to/application {\n   [...]\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `#include` directives allow statements pertaining to multiple applications to be placed in a common file, then included into the profile of each relevant application.\n\nThe `<tunables/global>` file, corresponding to `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/global` in turn includes definitions that should be available to every profile. One of these additional includes is `/etc/apparmor/tunables/home`, which together with a `@{HOME}/** rw` (or similar directive) grant applications access to user home directories. \n\nIf this is the case, in order to deny access to certain files in the user home directory, one would need to [add a profile rule to explicitly deny access to the files](https://askubuntu.com/questions/177195/apparmor-notify-exclude-application \"apparmor-notify exclude application\"). This can be done using the `deny` directive, such as in the following example:\n\n```\n#include <tunables/global>\n/path/to/application {\n   [...]\n   # Allow directory listings (i.e. 'r' on directories).\n   @{HOME}/ r\n\n   # This is needed for saving files in the home directory.\n   @{HOME}/** rw\n\n   # Revoke access to specific file\n   deny /home/user/file rwa\n}\n\n```\n\nThe would deny read (`r`), write (`w`) and append (`a`) access to `/home/user/file`.\n\nAn alternative is to add the paths you want to protect to `/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/private-files` or `/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/private-files-strict` and make sure the AppArmor profile for each application to be affected includes the `<abstractions/private-files>` or `<abstraction/private-files-strict>`. These files should already contain rules for common files which should be protected for the purpose of privacy or other security considerations. \n\nFor a full list of access mode details and more information on AppArmor security profiles, consult the `apparmor.d` [manual page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/apparmor.d.5.html \"apparmor.d manual page\") and [Novell AppArmor Administration Guide (pdf)](http://www.novell.com/documentation/apparmor/pdfdoc/apparmor2_admin/apparmor2_admin.pdf \"Novell AppArmor Administration Guide\")."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're configuring AppArmor on an openSUSE system to restrict a specific application from accessing certain private files in a user's home directory, while still allowing access to other applications.

Instead, the recommendation is to use regularization (parameter 'alpha' in MLPClassifier) to stabilize the model if needed.

Of the various examples I could use, there are a few basic forms: \n\nImplicit Specification\n----------------------\n\nMike is actually a target for an assassination attempt by a terror organization. In all their correspondences between each other, they refer to 'the night,' though it's never stated that 'the night' is when they execute their plan (and Mike.)\n\nIn this case, sentences that refer to 'the night' are implicitly assumed to mean *that* night. \n\nFor example:\n\n> Remember that Mike will be singing on the night. We need to take him out on stage.\n\nInferred Specification\n----------------------\n\nIf, in a previous sentence, 'the night' is identified, then the value is used by inference. @Billy Kerr provided an excellent example of this in the comments:\n\n> The concert will be held on Friday evening. It's going to be wonderful. Mike will sing on the night.\n\nIn this case, 'the night' refers to Friday evening. \n\nExtended Literal Specification\n------------------------------\n\nMaybe the sentence you provided wasn't complete. If I were to complete it, I'd expand it to something like:\n\n> Mike is going to sing on the night of the 25th\n\nThis explicitly describes *which* night Mike will sing on within the scope of the sentence. \n\nThis usage could be better viewed as an extension of 'on the (date)'. One would logically say \n\n> Mike is going to sing on the 25th\n\nwhich describes when Mike will sing. If we prepend 'the night of' to 'the 25th', then we talk more specifically about when Mike will sing.\n\nNoun Form\n---------\n\nIf 'On the Night' is the title of a song, then Mike would be singing that song.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion\n-------------\n\nYou can't use that grammar without the understanding that 'the night' refers to something specific."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"at night\" and \"on the night\" is most accurate?\n\nA) \"At night\" and \"on the night\" can be used interchangeably in all contexts without changing the meaning of a sentence.\n\nB) \"On the night\" is always used to refer to a specific night, while \"at night\" is used for general nighttime occurrences.\n\nC) \"On the night\" can only be used when directly followed by a date or specific event name.\n\nD) \"On the night\" requires context or specification, either implicit or explicit, while \"at night\" can be used more generally without additional context.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because \"on the night\" typically requires some form of context or specification to be meaningful, whether it's implicitly understood, inferred from previous statements, or explicitly stated within the sentence or surrounding text. This specification can come in various forms, such as an implicit understanding among speakers, inference from previously mentioned dates or events, or direct specification within the sentence (e.g., \"on the night of the 25th\").\n\nIn contrast, \"at night\" is a more general phrase that can be used without additional context to refer to nighttime in general. It doesn't require specifying a particular night or event.\n\nOption A is incorrect because these phrases are not interchangeable in all contexts. Option B oversimplifies the usage, as \"on the night\" doesn't always refer to a specific night if used as part of a title or in certain idiomatic expressions. Option C is too restrictive, as \"on the night\" can be used with implicit or inferred specifications that don't directly follow it in the sentence."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/04", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/466802", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/318751/"], "docs_id": 466802, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the Merriam\\-Webster dictionary *skill* is defined as\n\n> 1\\.\n> \n> \n> a: the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance\n> \n> \n> b: dexterity or coordination especially in the execution of learned physical tasks\n> \n> \n> 2\\.\n> \n> \n> learned power of doing something competently : a developed aptitude or ability\n\nIn Russian there are two words for different kinds of skills, \"\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" (umeniye) and \"\u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\" (navyk). The first word designates skill in the above three (1a, 1b, and 2\\) senses. The second word designates the kind of skill which doesn't require voluntary actions.\n\nFor example, a basketball coach teaches a kid to shoot a ball: the coach shows how to put a ball in a hand, how to locate and move an arm, how to use legs, how to release a ball, etc. After few attempts (let's assume that the kid is very talented) the kid is able to execute a shot in the way the coach taught him/her. The kid has acquired a shooting skill in the sense of \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (umeniye), because the kid still has to pay attention to his/her body position, arm movement, releasing technique... But after several days of practice the kid doesn't have to pay any attention to those things, because all these movements are done automatically (unlike, for example, shot selection). So the skill in the sense of \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (umeniye) became the skill in the sense of \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a (navyk).\n\nSo I'm wondering is there a word in English to designate this notion of skill.\n\n---\n\nI have considered several options, but I\u2019m not sure of their accuracy. The word \u2018habit\u2019 seems like the closest one. However, the main distinctive feature of the word \u2018navyk\u2019 is *automatic* or *involuntary* trait of an action, so the English analogue has to have the same feature. To me the main feature of the notion \u2018habit\u2019 is an *inclination* to do something in a particular manner. For example, I could say \u2018I have a habit to eat eggs for breakfast\u2019. Habit in this context doesn\u2019t require any skill, while shooting a basketball does. Moreover, I could lose a skill (or even ability) to do something, but a habit could remain, I just won\u2019t be able to satisfy my habit (or it would be more difficult if I lose a skill in the sense of 'navyk').\n\n**Update**.\n\nThe word \"skill\" could be applied not only to physical activities, such as shooting a basketball, but also to mental activities. For example, we can say \u201ccommunication skills\u201d or \u201cmathematical skills\u201d etc. And the distinction between the two types of skills I mentioned in the original question is applicable for mental activities as well.\n\nLet me give an example of what I believe is called a spelling skill. For most of the words we use we don\u2019t have to think about how to spell them, because we read or wrote them too often. But in some cases we have to think about the correct spelling by remembering some rules or etymology of a particular word. Here, again, we can distinguish two kinds of skills: first is the one I called \u201cnavyk\u201d, and the second one is \u201cumeniye\u201d.\n\nThis example illustrates that the notion of muscle memory, which has been offered, doesn\u2019t really fit the concept I\u2019m trying to find a word for.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Muscle memory**\n\nFrom [Oxford living dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/muscle_memory):\n\n> The ability to reproduce a particular movement without conscious thought, acquired as a result of frequent repetition of that movement.\n\nI think it fits your example quite well: the kid has a **muscle memory** of how to shoot the basketball.

For example, we start with supposing $z\\_1\\=z\\_2\\=z\\_3\\=z\\_4\\=z\\_5\\=0$, then first deduce $z\\_6\\=0$ and $z\\_9\\=0$ and next $z\\_7\\=0$ and $z\\_8\\=0$. If it can be shown that with any initial assignment of zeros satisfying (i)\\-(iii) we will succesfully deduce all the $z\\_k$'s are zero, then the answer for $m\\=10$ is true. This may hopefully lead to a more efficient algorithm for our system than using Groebner basis method. \n\n**Edit:** My attempt to this problem illustrated earlier is in fact considering if there exist $\\\\emptyset\\\\neq N\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the following three conditions.\n\n(I) $(N\\+\\\\frac{m}{2})\\\\cap N\\=\\\\emptyset$;\n\n(II) $(\\-N)\\\\cap N\\=\\\\emptyset$;\n\n(III) for each $k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$, $(2k\\-N)\\\\cap N\\\\neq\\\\{k\\\\}$.\n\nIf there does not exist such nonempty $N$ for some fixed $m$, then the polynomial system is zero\\-dimensional for this $m$.\n\nIn order to show that if the above mentioned $N$ does not exist then $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ for the corresponding $m$, we suppose $V$ contains a nonzero point $z\\=(z\\_0,z\\_1,\\\\dots,z\\_{m\\-1})$ and let $N\\_1$ consist of all the indices $s$ (modulo $m$) with $z\\_s\\\\neq0$. It is easy to see that $N\\_1$ satisfies (I), because $z\\_s$ and $z\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}}$ cannot be nonzero simultaneously for any $s$ since $z\\_sz\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}\\+s}\\=0$. Similarly, $N\\_1$ satisfies (II). To show (III) for $N\\_1$, assume on the contrary that $(2k\\-N\\_1\\)\\\\cap N\\_1\\=\\\\{k\\\\}$ for some $k$. Then $z\\_k\\\\neq0$ and so $z\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}\\+k}\\=0$. Moreover, for any $j\\\\neq k$, $j\\\\not\\\\in(2k\\-N\\_1\\)\\\\cap N\\_1$. Hence $2k\\-j\\\\not\\\\in N\\_1$ or $j\\\\not\\\\in N\\_1$, which is to say, $z\\_{2k\\-j}\\=0$ or $z\\_j\\=0$. So $z\\_jz\\_{2k\\-j}\\=0$ for any $j\\\\neq k$, contradicting $\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{s\\=0}^{m\\-1}z\\_sz\\_{2k\\-s}\\=0$.\n\n**Edit after two answers have been posted:** Will Sawin's answer saves me from going in the previous edited way. Lev Borisov wrote $f\\_t$ into product of two linear factors and then suggested showing all the possible linear systems are zero\\-dimensional. I tried to follow Lev Borisov's way, but still see no light. (If anyone knows how to probably do it, point out for me please.) However, I figured out how to show the system is zero\\-dimensional for $m\\=10,12,14$. I will upgrade here my study progress to this problem.\n\nHereafter, I will use the mod $m$ indices. The following observations will be useful.\n\n**Claim 1:** Let $a\\\\in(\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times$. If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$, then $(x\\_0,x\\_a,\\\\dots,x\\_{a(m\\-1\\)})$ and $(x\\_{m/2},x\\_{1\\+m/2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1\\+m/2})$ are both in $V$.\n\nIn light of Claim 1, define maps $\\\\phi\\_a$ and $\\\\psi\\_a$ on $\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$ for each $a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times$ by\n$$\n\\\\phi\\_a(x):x\\\\mapsto ax\\+m(1\\+\\\\rho(a))/4,\\\\quad\\\\psi\\_a(x):x\\\\mapsto ax\\+m(1\\-\\\\rho(a))/4,\n$$\nwhere $\\\\rho$ is the Jacobi symbol mod $m$. Then all the $\\\\phi\\_a$ and $\\\\psi\\_a$ form an abelian group $G$ of order $2\\\\varphi(m)$, and all the $\\\\phi\\_a$ form a subgroup $H$ of order $\\\\varphi(m)$. Let $G$ act on $\\\\mathbb{C}\\[z\\_0,\\\\dots,z\\_{m\\-1}]$ by action on the indices of $z\\_k$'s. \n\n**Claim 2:** If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$ satisfies $x\\_2\\=x\\_4\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-2}\\=0$, then $x\\_1\\=x\\_3\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-1}\\=0$.\n\nClaim 2 follows from the convolution formula of discrete Fourier transform on $(x\\_1,x\\_3,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})$. Similarly we have\n\n**Claim 3:** If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$ satisfies $x\\_1\\=x\\_3\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-1}\\=0$, then $x\\_2\\=x\\_4\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-2}\\=0$.\n\n**Case $m\\=10$:** Multiply $z\\_1$ on both sides of $f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3\\+2z\\_1z\\_4z\\_8\\=0$. Further multiply $z\\_3$ on both sides gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$. Hence by Claim 1, $z\\_8z\\_4\\=\\\\phi\\_3(z\\_1z\\_3\\)\\=0$. This leads to $z\\_1^3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1\\=0$. Therefore, $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ by Claim 1 since $G$ acts transitively on $\\\\mathbb{Z}/10\\\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Case $m\\=12$:** $z\\_1z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$. This implies $z\\_7z\\_9\\=\\\\psi\\_1(z\\_1z\\_3\\)\\=0$ by Claim 1\\. Hence $f\\_2\\=0$ turns out to be $z\\_2^2\\+z\\_8^2\\=0$, which in conjunction with $z\\_2z\\_8\\=0$ implies $z\\_2\\=z\\_8\\=0$. Therefore, $z\\_4\\=z\\_{10}\\=0$ by Claim 1, and so $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ by Claim 2\\.\n\n**Case $m\\=14$:** $z\\_1z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\+2z\\_1z\\_3z\\_4z\\_{12}\\=0$, and $z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3\\=0$. The latter implies $z\\_4z\\_1z\\_{12}\\=\\\\psi\\_{11}(z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3\\)\\=0$ by Claim 1, which leads to $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, i.e. $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$. Hence $z\\_4z\\_{12}\\=\\\\psi\\_{11}(z\\_1z\\_3\\)\\=0$ and $z\\_{11}z\\_5\\=\\\\phi\\_{11}(z\\_1z\\_3\\)\\=0$. Thus $z\\_1f\\_1\\=0$ turns out to be $\\-z\\_1^3\\=2z\\_1z\\_6z\\_{10}$. Put $g\\=\\\\phi\\_3$. Then $g$ generate $H$ and the above equation can be written as $\\-z\\_1^3\\=2z\\_1z\\_{g^3(1\\)}z\\_{g(1\\)}$. Now consider any $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{11})\\\\in V$. By Claim 1, $\\-z\\_{g^j(1\\)}^3\\=2z\\_{g^j(1\\)}z\\_{g^{j\\+3}(1\\)}z\\_{g^{j\\+1}(1\\)}$ for $j\\=0,\\\\dots,5$, and hence we know that $x\\_{g^{j\\+1}(1\\)}\\=0\\\\Rightarrow x\\_{g^j(1\\)}\\=0$. Therefore, any $x\\_{g^j(1\\)}\\=0$ will lead to $x\\_1\\=0$, and\n$$\n\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{j\\=0}^5\\-z\\_{g^j(1\\)}^3\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{j\\=0}^52z\\_{g^j(1\\)}z\\_{g^{j\\+3}(1\\)}z\\_{g^{j\\+1}(1\\)}.\n$$\nFrom the above we deduce that $\\\\prod\\_{j\\=0}^5z\\_{g^j(1\\)}\\=0$, and so $x\\_{g^j(1\\)}\\=0$ for some $j$, which leads to $x\\_1\\=0$. Thus we have shown $z\\_1\\=0$, and so $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ by Claim 1 since $G$ acts transitively on $\\\\mathbb{Z}/14\\\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nViewing the above discussion, I would suggest study first the case $m\\=2l$ where $l$ is prime.

This can be done by editing /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, navigating to line 222, and adding a '#' at the beginning of the line. After this change, Apache should be able to restart successfully. \n\nOption A is excessive and time-consuming. Option B might work but could introduce unknown configuration issues.

I would recommend doing this while the array is healthy, if at all possible.\n\nIt's also possible you have multiple failed disks. Depending on *which* disks in a RAID\\-10 set fail, you can lose more than one (up to 3 in your case) without the array going offline; however, if you lose only two, but they're in the same RAID\\-1 pair, then the whole array will go down.\n\nDon't forget to contact Dell Support if your system is still in warranty.

What is the most likely cause of this unexpected behavior?\n\nA) The RAID 10 array is functioning normally, as any single disk failure should make the entire volume unavailable.\nB) Multiple disks have failed simultaneously, causing the entire array to go offline.\nC) The PERC H310 mini controller is malfunctioning or has outdated firmware.\nD) The Windows operating system is incorrectly reporting the status of the RAID array.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. A single disk failure in a properly functioning RAID 10 array should not cause the entire volume to become unavailable. This behavior suggests that there is likely an issue with the PERC H310 mini controller itself. The controller may be malfunctioning or could have outdated firmware that is causing it to incorrectly handle the disk failure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a RAID 10 array is designed to withstand a single disk failure without losing data availability.\n\nOption B is possible but less likely given the information provided. While multiple disk failures could cause the array to go offline, the question specifically mentions a single disk failure.\n\nOption D is unlikely, as the Windows operating system typically reports the status based on information received from the RAID controller.

The phrase I'm looking for has to do with me using a metaphor to describe some personal discovery. For instance, someone finds a novel solution for a long standing problem.

This term refers to metaphors that have lost their original impact or imagery due to changes in society, technology, or common experiences. The example given in the text about \"taking the bit between one's teeth\" illustrates this concept perfectly. When horses were a common part of daily life, this metaphor was easily understood.

Is it true for varieties with cohomology generated by algebraic cycles (i.e. $h^{p,q}(X)\\=0$ unless $p\\=q$ and satisfying Hodge conjecture), for example for **Grassmannians**, **toric varieties**, etc.? This is not at all clear that the traces of $f$ on cohomology will be nonnegative.\n\nProbably you have lots of counterexamples. What about positive results?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By demand I expand a little on my answer. The holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula (aka the Woods\\-Hole formula) considers an endomorphism $f\\\\colon M \\\\to M$ of a smooth and compact complex manifold $M$ (or proper\nsmooth algebraic variety) with only isolated fixed points which are also assumed to be non\\-degenerate (i.e., the\ntangent map of $f$ at a fixed point does not have eigenvalue $1$. Then the alternating trace of the action of $f$ on $H^\\*(M,\\\\mathcal O\\_M)$ is equal to a sum over the fixed points $p$ of $1/det(1\\-T\\_p(f)$. In particular if there\nare no fixed points the alternating trace is equal to $0$. However, in the case when also $H^i(M,\\\\mathcal O\\_M)\\=0$ for $i\\>0$ then the alternating trace is equal to $1$ so the assumption that there are no fixed points gives a contradiction. Note, that the dimension of $H^i(M,\\\\mathcal O\\_M)$ is just $h^{0,i}$ so that an assumption that the Hodge numbers vanish off the diagonal gives the required vanishing by a good margin. Furthermore, the vanishing of just $h^{0,i}$ for $i\\>0$ is much much weaker, it is for instance a birational condition whereas blowing up a smooth curve of genus $\\>0$ in a variety of dimension at least 3 always give\noff diagonal Hodge numbers.\n\nAs for the question of whether a birational involution of $\\\\mathbb C^n$ always has a fixed point this seems trickier. It is true that the involution can be made to act regularly on a smooth and proper model and hence by the above has a fixed point. It is not clear however that the fixed point will map to a point of $\\\\mathbb C^n$ as $\\\\mathbb C^n$ is not proper."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fixed points of regular maps on algebraic varieties is correct?\n\nA) Any regular map from a projective space to itself always has a fixed point due to the Lefschetz fixed point formula.\n\nB) The existence of fixed points for regular self-maps is guaranteed for all smooth, complex, connected algebraic varieties.\n\nC) For a variety with cohomology generated by algebraic cycles, any regular self-map must have a fixed point.\n\nD) The holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula guarantees a fixed point for any endomorphism of a smooth and compact complex manifold, regardless of its Hodge numbers.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The statement in option A is correct. For projective spaces (P\u207f), the cohomology is Z in even dimensions and 0 otherwise. The pullback of an effective cycle is effective, so all summands in the Lefschetz fixed point formula are nonnegative, with the 0-th term being positive. This ensures that any regular map from P\u207f to itself has a fixed point.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there are counterexamples to this general statement for all smooth, complex, connected algebraic varieties.\n\nOption C is not necessarily true. While varieties with cohomology generated by algebraic cycles (i.e., h^(p,q)(X)=0 unless p=q and satisfying the Hodge conjecture) might have this property, it's not guaranteed for all such varieties.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula relates the alternating trace of the action on cohomology to a sum over fixed points, but it doesn't guarantee the existence of fixed points for all endomorphisms.

The arcpy.mapping.ListBookmarks function allows programmatic access to Bookmark information, including their extents. By using this function in a Python script, the analyst can automatically extract the extent of each Bookmark and create corresponding features. This method is far more efficient than manually creating polygons (Option A) and doesn't require any non-existent tools (Option D) or indirect methods (Option C).\n\nOption A is technically feasible but extremely time-consuming and prone to human error. \n\nOption C is incorrect because Bookmarks store extent information, not just single points, and there's no direct \"Export Bookmarks to CSV\" functionality in ArcGIS.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no built-in \"Convert Bookmarks to Features\" tool in ArcToolbox.

It's capitalized because it's the first word in the sentence, not because it's a proper noun. The lack of an article (like \"The\") before \"Fall\" is correct, as articles are usually omitted when referring to seasons in general, rather than a specific instance of a season.

There are tens of thousands of such questions on SO. Now with the CS Theory site, what is happening is that random \\[algorithm] questions are being migrated to the CS Theory, or just closed as \"off topic\". There is no rhyme or reason other than random chance. In theory I suppose 90% of the \\[algorithm] tagged posts could be moved to CS Theory, but the problem is that SO has nearly 2 million users and practically nobody uses CS Theory. Who wants to post a question to a forum with 11,000 (low time) users when you could post to SO with almost 2,000,000 users? Nobody. Getting migrated to CS is like getting your post deleted.\n\nAlso, as an algorithm \"answerer\" I do not want to visit two different forums. I do not want to be switching back and forth. Also I DEFINITELY do not want my badge/rep efforts to be split between two forums. I want my rep to be on ONE site, SO, because that is where I am asking my questions, which are often not algorithm related.\n\nI used to paticipate in a machining forum and posted to General a set of really interesting photos that would be of general interest to machinists and the moderator force moved my post to the \"fabrication\" sub forum that had literally \\<1% of the population of the general forum just because some of the photos were tangentially fabrication related. It was more or less equivalent to deleting my post, that I spent a LOT of time on. I stopped using that forum.\n\nI am wondering if anybody agrees with me that this is a serious problem that is causing fragmentation in posts in the \\[algorithm] tag and what we can do about it?\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- EXAMPLE\n\nTo provide a concrete example, here is some guy's post: [TSP question post on SO that got migrated](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12485/evolutionary-algorithm-for-the-physical-travelling-salesman-problem).

Written for ecologists , I think this is one of the best books on practical data analysis regardless of background, I'm an engineer and I have used it a lot. I'm sure there are other mathematical statistics book, however this book is by far the most practical book that I have read. He also has a package [BBMLE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle/index.html) which you might want to check. \nThe book unlike any other goes in to maximum likelihood estimation, profile likelihood and confidence interval estimation and all that.\n\nComing back to your problem, you need to write a log\\-likelihood of the function that you are trying to fit the data. Obviously you are assuming the error to be normally distributed as in the simulation, so the Log likelihood is:\n\n$Log\\\\ Likelihood (Lambda,sd) \\= \\-\\\\frac{n}{2} log(sd) \\- \\\\frac{n}{2} log(2\\\\pi)\\- \\\\frac{(y\\-x^{Lambda})^2}{2sd} $\n\nYou need to maximize the above equation using an optimization routine such as `optim` in `R`. Use the `Hessian` matrix from the optimization to assess the uncertainty of your estimated log likelihood function i.e., how steep or how flat the curvature of your function is at the optimal point. If the function is steep which implies less uncertainties at optimal point you would have a tighter confidence band on your parameter estimates, on the other hand if its flat you would have a wider confidence interval. Hessian, Fisher Information matrix would help you calculate the standard error and confidence interval.\n\nHere is how you do it in R:\n\n```\n    set.seed(8345)\n\nLambda = 1/2.42\n\nx = rbeta(1e4, shape1=2,shape2=2)\ny = x^Lambda + rnorm(1e4,mean = 0, sd=.1)\n\nplot(x,y)\n\n## Write Log Likelihood function\n\nlog.lik <- function(theta,y,x){\n\n  Lam <- theta[1]\n  sigma2 <- theta[2]\n\n  # sample size\n  n <-  length(y)\n\n  #error\n  e<-y-(x^Lam)\n\n  #log likelihood\n  logl<- -.5*n*log(2*pi)-.5*n*log(sigma2)-((t(e)%*%e)/(2*sigma2))\n\n  return(-logl) # R optim does minimize so to maximize  multiply by -1\n}\n\n## Estimate Paramters thru maximum likelihood\n\nmax.lik <- optim(c(1,1), fn=log.lik, method = \"L-BFGS-B\", lower = c(0.00001,0.00001), hessian = T,y=y,x=x)\n\n# Lambda\nLam <- max.lik$par[1]\n#0.4107119\n\n#Fisher Information MAtrix\nfisher_info<-solve(max.lik$hessian)\nprop_sigma<-sqrt(diag(fisher_info))\n\n## Estimate 95% Confidence Interval\nupper<-max.lik$par+1.96*prop_sigma\nlower<-max.lik$par-1.96*prop_sigma\n\ninterval<-data.frame(Parameter = c(\"Lambda\",\"sd\"),value=max.lik$par, lower=lower, upper=upper)\ninterval\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of estimating \u03bb in the fitted line x^\u03bb, where x \u2208 [0, 1], which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and confidence intervals?\n\nA) The log-likelihood function for this problem does not depend on the standard deviation of the error term.\n\nB) The Hessian matrix from the optimization is irrelevant for assessing the uncertainty of the estimated parameters.\n\nC) A steeper curvature of the log-likelihood function at the optimal point implies wider confidence intervals for the parameter estimates.\n\nD) The Fisher Information Matrix, derived from the Hessian, can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals for the estimated parameters.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the Fisher Information Matrix, which is the inverse of the Hessian matrix at the maximum likelihood estimate, provides a measure of the curvature of the log-likelihood function.

To ensure full research completion, players should focus on researching Brute Splicers before leaving Siren Alley, the fifth level. This makes option B the correct answer, as it allows players to maximize their research opportunities before the Brute Splicers temporarily disappear from the game. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Pauper's Drop is too early in the game, and players would miss out on research opportunities in Siren Alley. Option C is incorrect because by the time players reach Dionysus Park, it's already too late to research Brute Splicers. Option D is incorrect because Fontaine Futuristics is well past the point where Brute Splicers have stopped appearing.\n\nThe question tests the player's knowledge of the game's progression and the importance of timing in completing research objectives, which is a key aspect of the BioShock 2 gameplay experience."}}
