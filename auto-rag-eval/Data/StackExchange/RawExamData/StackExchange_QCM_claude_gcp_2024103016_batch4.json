Especially if you consider the claims made in [this article](http://www.freekpaans.nl/2015/01/dependency-injection-are-you-doing-it-wrong/) to hold water, I think it's all quite clear and straight\\-forward.\n\nAnyway there is one quote about *Ports and Adapters* that made me think about the way that I structured my classes in the past \n\n> The components in the inner hexagon have few or no dependencies on each other, while components in the outer hexagon act as Adapters between the inner components, and the application boundaries: its ports.\n\nGiven I'd like to implement some app business logic, called `App` hereinafter (not a too meaningful name, anyway), which would allow us to display a list of filtered employees. Displaying a list of employees would provided by a port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeListProvider\n{\n    EmployeeList GetEmployees();\n}\n\n```\n\nand persistence would be another port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeRpository\n{\n    IEnumerable<Employee> GetAllEmployees();\n    void AddEmployee(Employee employeeToAdd);\n    void UpdateEmployee(Employee employeeToUpdate);\n    // further method signatures\n}\n\n```\n\nNow I would implement my business logic\n\n```\nclass App : IEmployeeListProvider\n{\n    // most likely the filters or filter conditions would be injected.\n    // and the IEmployeeRepository anyway\n\n    public EmployeeList GetEmployees()\n    {\n        var employees = employeeRepository.GetAllEmployees();\n        var filteredEmployees = FilterEmployees(employees);\n        return EmployeeList.FromEnumerable(filteredEmployees);\n    }\n\n    private IEnumerable<Employee> FilterEmployees(IEnumerable<IEmployee> employees)\n    {\n        // elided\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nBasically this is how I understood Ports and Adapters as [proposed by Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture). Anyway, this implementation somehow contradicts the Mark Seeman quote (see above), since `App` depends bot on the `IEmployeeRepository` *and* the `IEmployeeListProvider` ports. Of course it would be possible to restructure the design to use a filter port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeFilter\n{\n    IEnumerable<Employee> FilterEmployees(IEnumerable<Employee> employees);\n}\n\n```\n\nand do something like this from the UI\n\n```\nIEmployeeFilter filter = ...; // however this is constructed\nIEmployeeRepository repository = ...; \n\n// ...\n\nvar employees = filter.FilterEmployees(repository.GetAllEmployees());\n\n```\n\nbut this feels wrong to me for several reasons: \n\n* The UI would depend on a DAL port\n* We are potentially shifting logic to the UI code\n* It's quite likely that UI will become a *\"dependency hog\"*\n\nDid I get the whole quote of Mark Seeman wrong I is there any other part that I got fundamentally wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It doesn't contradict the statement. Conceptually, your business object, App, *provides* \"ports\" (the two interfaces) so that you can hook up other components on top. The two interfaces are *owned* by the App class. Yes, it depends on those interfaces, but it does *not* depend on the components that implement or use them \\- and that's exactly the point. IEmployeeRepository is a so called *required interface* (the App class requires that other components implement this interface in order to be able to work with the App class), and IEmployeeListProvider is a *provided interface* (provided by the App class, for other components to use). You should view the three types (App, IEmployeeRepository, IEmployeeListProvider) as a single thing (and you would put them in the same package). Then, the other components that implement or use these interfaces depend on them (and, by extension, on the whole triplet). \n\nThat's what (the first part of) the dependency inversion principle states: \"High\\-level modules should not depend on low\\-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\" Here, your high\\-level module is the App class, and one of the low\\-level modules would be, say, the repository. The abstraction they both depend on is the IEmployeeRepository interface, but the key thing is that this interface is owned by the App class, *not* by the implementation of the repository. So to determine the direction of the dependency, you look at the direction of the arrow between the implementation of the repository, and the App \\+ IEmployeeRepository pair."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Ports and Adapters architecture, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between the App class, IEmployeeRepository interface, and IEmployeeListProvider interface?\n\nA) The App class should not depend on both IEmployeeRepository and IEmployeeListProvider interfaces to adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle.\n\nB) The App class, IEmployeeRepository, and IEmployeeListProvider should be viewed as separate, independent components to maintain loose coupling.\n\nC) The App class, IEmployeeRepository, and IEmployeeListProvider should be considered as a single cohesive unit, with the interfaces owned by the App class.\n\nD) The implementation of IEmployeeRepository should own the interface definition to properly separate concerns in the architecture.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because in the Ports and Adapters architecture, the App class and its associated interfaces (IEmployeeRepository and IEmployeeListProvider) should be viewed as a single cohesive unit. The App class owns these interfaces, which serve as \"ports\" for other components to connect to. This approach adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, where high-level modules (App) and low-level modules (implementations of the interfaces) both depend on abstractions (the interfaces themselves). This structure allows for flexibility and maintainability in the system design."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/280039", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/48253/"], "docs_id": 280039, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We don\u2019t want to make a call out to PayPal (<https://www.paypalobjects.com/api/checkout.js>) file when loading the homepage.\nWe should only be making calls to PayPal on the cart page and checkout.\n\n**Module Name**: Magento\\_Paypal\n\n> File Path:\n>  vendor/magento/module\\-paypal/view/frontend/requirejs\\-config.js\n\n```\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

But the \"executable\" parts are gone. And how does 7\\-zip determine this file type? Shouldn't the `.exe` files have PE headers on Windows?\n\nWhat's more confusing: I've found that an ISO file can be decompressed using 7\\-zip, but the 7\\-zip says it can handle that file type, so it's fine. But if I open the [VirtualBox Installer](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.18/VirtualBox-6.0.18-136238-Win.exe) using 7\\-zip, the file content is like:\n\n```\n.rsrc/\n.data\n.rdata\n.reloc\n.rsrc_1\n.text\nCERTIFICATE\n\n```\n\nThese files are the resource file within the exe, and 7\\-zip reported the file type is `PE`, so I guess it is acting like resource hacker and shows the resource files? But not all exe files can be opened in this way, why? And when I opened the [Open VPN Installer](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.4.8-I602-Win10.exe), the file content is like:\n\n```\n$PLUGINSDIR\n$TEMP\nbin\ndoc\neasy-rsa\nsample-config\nicon.ico\nUninstall.exe.nsis\n\n```\n\nAnd this is basically what I will get after installation except those `$` folders. And the file type is `Nsis`, the same as the self\\-extracting executable `.exe`. So I assume they are using the same mechanics, am I right? But why this file is not `PE` type? Or the 7\\-zip is just a Swiss Army knife kind software that can handle any file types?

Executables can't be unzipped but they have an internal structure and 7Zip knows about this structure and presents you a view that looks like a ZIP archive but instead shows the internal structure of the executable file. \n\nExecutables that have an \"attached\" ZIP file\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYour second example \\- the installer file is a combination of an executable \\+ plus a ZIP file appended to the executable. \n\n```\n$PLUGINSDIR\n$TEMP\nbin\ndoc\neasy-rsa\nsample-config\nicon.ico\nUninstall.exe.nsis\n\n```\n\nWhen the installer is executed only the executable front part is executed. Then this code part performs a self\\-extraction by searching it's own executable file for the beginning of the ZIP file. Then this ZIP file is extracted and processed by the installer.\n\nWhen opening such a file 7zip and other archive extraction tools are searching for the ZIP file start and just ignore the executable front part. Therefore you can open such executable files and see the content without having to execute the installer.\n\nNote that not all installer use this way or use a proprietary archive format that can't be viewed by 7\\-zip.

Some installer executables are designed as a combination of an executable front-end and a ZIP file appended to it. 7-Zip can detect the beginning of this appended ZIP file and extract its contents without executing the installer. This is why some executables, when opened with 7-Zip, reveal a list of files and folders that will be installed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all executable files contain ZIP archives. Some executables only show their internal structure in 7-Zip, which is different from a contained archive.\n\nOption B is false because 7-Zip does not decompile executables to show source code. It can show the internal structure of executables or extract appended archives, but it doesn't reverse-engineer the code.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the internal structure view of an executable in 7-Zip (showing sections like .rsrc, .data, .text) is different from the list of files that will be installed.

If you're tempted to use the cursor keys directly in insert mode, maybe the mode switch is too cumbersome for you. This is especially true with the default location of the `Escape` key. Many users map it to left Control or Caps Lock because of that.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to your question, but the fact that you've asked this question means that there are some doubts on your side. In the end, only you can decide. Keep monitoring yourself, keep comparing and trying different approaches. For example, you could `:map` your cursor keys to `<Nop>` for one Vim session, to wean you off those keys. It might feel clumsy at first, but you need to find out how you'll feel about that at the end of a longer editing session.\n\nSome users are very strict about avoiding cursor keys, or even repetitive primitive motions (like `lllll...` or `jjj...`), and there are plugins that check on or disallow that. Personally, I think it's best to be pragmatic about it. For short tactical edits, I don't mind staying in insert mode and using the cursor keys, especially if I'm currently using other applications in parallel (which often enforce this style of editing). For longer edits that are purely in Vim, I usually exit insert mode often and quickly."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Django blog application, a developer is trying to restrict editing of blog posts to their owners.

Checking in the view ensures that even if a user tries to access the edit URL directly, they will be denied access if they're not the owner.

If the drawing are wrong, could you please explain how we would draw the full circuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Your first picture is almost correct, but you can't connect the top and ground parts directly. If you would connect them you would build a short circuit and you had no voltage over your transistor circuit anymore.  \n\nThe way the diagram in the book is drawn is a typical way to show where the (\\+) and the (\\-) of the voltage source is connected. I have drawn a battery (red) in the circuit to show what exactly that means. At the top you have the positive voltage of say 1\\.2V and the ground symbols are connected to the negative terminal and are interpreted as 0V.\n2. C is not connected to 1\\.2V or ground at the output (like you have drawn it), but by the transistors. That's the whole purpose of this circuit. C is the output that (dependent on the input signals) is either connected by the upper two transistors to the positive terminal (1\\.2V) or the negative terminal (0V). I have drawn these two paths in blue and green.  \n\nThis way the circuit fulfills the role as a logic gate: The two inputs A and B both have to be at LOW potential for the upper two transistors to be conductive. So with both inputs LOW, the output C is connected to logic HIGH (the supply voltage). The lower two transistors are not conductive in this case. But if one of the inputs is at HIGH potential, one of the two upper transistors does not conduct anymore, so the output is not connected to the supply. Instead one of the lower transistors gets conducting and the outputs is \"pulled LOW\".  \n\nThe circuit is representing a NOR gate.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mk6Rx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mk6Rx.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the CMOS NOR gate circuit described, what is the correct statement about the output C?\n\nA) Output C is directly connected to either 1.2V or ground through external wires.\n\nB) Output C is always at 1.2V when both inputs A and B are LOW.\n\nC) Output C is pulled LOW when either input A or B (or both) are HIGH.\n\nD) Output C is connected to 1.2V when either input A or B (or both) are HIGH.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

For example:\n\n> I've long considered the possibilities of the **Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson** Cinematic Universe.  \n> \n>  \u2014[Matt Miller, \"Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's Longtime Producer Confirms All His Movies Are Connected\", *Esquire*, Jul 23, 2018](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a22514438/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-movies-connected-cinematic-universe/))\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> Born in New York City on October 27, 1858, **Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt** was governor of New York before becoming U.S. vice president.

He has received multiple awards and nominations including an Academy Award as producer under his own company Plan B Entertainment.  \n> \n>  \u2014[\"Brad Pitt\", Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brad_Pitt&oldid=850951637)\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> Emma Grace \"Grace\" Smith was born . . .  \n> \n>  \u2014representative obituary/genealogy entry (I don't want to link for privacy reasons, but any search for \"grace grace smith\" as a phrase (or \"marie marie johnson\" or other common middle and last names) along with the word obituary will turn up multiple examples)\n\nThis form (Firstname Middlename \"Callname\" Lastname) also shows up for nicknames sometimes, especially where the full name is probably completely unfamiliar:\n\n> **Lawrence Peter \"Yogi\" Berra**  \n> \n>  \u2014[Entry for State Historical Society of Missouri](https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/b/berra/)\n\nOn the other hand, the form Firstname \"Callname\" Middlename Lastname is sometimes used when the call name is a nickname that is clearly derived from the first name: \n\n> **JAMES \"JIMMY\" EARL CARTER Jr.** was born in a small farming town called Plains in Sumter County, Georgia, on October 1, 1924\\.  \n> \n>  \u2014[National Governors' Association website entry](https://classic.nga.org/cms/jimmy-carter)\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> COMPANION (AC) IN THE GENERAL DIVISION OF THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA: **Ms Catherine (Cate) Elise Blanchett** For eminent service to the performing arts as an international stage and screen actor, through seminal contributions as director of artistic organisations, as a role model for women and young performers, and as a supporter of humanitarian and environmental causes.  \n> \n>  \u2014[\"2017 Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours Announced\", *Arts Review*, June 12, 2017](http://artsreview.com.au/2017-queens-birthday-honours-announced/) (note that this organization prefers parentheses over quotation marks; this is a style choice)\n\nAgain, these examples can be found searching for likely examples, such as \"katherine katie grace\" or \"margaret maggie jane\", both of which will find numerous obituaries.\n\nNone of this is set in stone; whether you use single\\- or double\\-quotation marks or parentheses, and whether you put the call name between first and middle, between middle and last, or between first and last (omitting the middle) are all style choices. I would recommend repeating the middle name when it is the call name, though, for clarity's sake."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Emma Grace Smith prefers to go by her middle name, but her legal first name is required for the company directory.

This format follows the convention described in the documentation for middle names used as call names. It includes the full legal name (Emma Grace Smith) while also clearly indicating that \"Grace\" is the preferred name by placing it in quotation marks after the middle name. This format provides complete information for official purposes while also respecting the individual's preference.\n\nOption A is incomplete as it omits the middle name from the legal name. Option C reverses the order of the names, which could cause confusion. Option D places the preferred name at the end, which is less common and doesn't clearly indicate that it's the middle name being used."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/22", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/380383", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/318304/"], "docs_id": 380383, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to make my own programming language by making an interpreter for it in Java, but lately people have been telling me that an interpreter needs to be in the same language as the one it is interpreting.

An interpreter can be written in any programming language, regardless of the language it interprets. This is supported by the documentation, which states that it isn't true that an interpreter needs to be in the same language as the one it is interpreting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that it's not true that an interpreter needs to be in the same language as the one it is interpreting.\n\nOption C is a common misconception. While it's often practical to write interpreters in lower-level languages for performance reasons, it's not a requirement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because interpreters don't have to be written in machine code. They can be written in high-level languages and then compiled or interpreted themselves.\n\nThe documentation also explains why an interpreter doesn't need to be in the same language as the one it interprets. If this were the case, it would lead to an infinite regression of interpreters, each needing another interpreter to run it."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/25", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/259469", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/248652/"], "docs_id": 259469, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a comment conversation is moved by moderators to a chat room, the upvotes on those comments are lost.

It is a common occurrence for extended discussions to crop up on artistic and subjective sites where the end result is likely to meaningfully improve the answer, but comments is not the right place to do this.\n\nMy only option when cleaning up these discussions is to migrate the discussion to chat, but in doing so, the support of various points is lost and it makes consensus harder to reach. \n\nYes, stars and comment upvotes have different meanings, however one is a superset of the other. Stars ARE used for things that are interesting or that people agree with. Upvotes on comments are used for the same. Stars can be used on other things as well, but that doesn't mean that comment upvotes don't map to them well.\n\nAs for the concerns about people with low rep not being able to chat, chat users are already created for migrated comments and the posts are tied to that user, so they'd be able to alter their stars if they wanted to under the normal rules.

When moderators move comment conversations to chat rooms, the upvotes on those comments are lost, which means there's no longer any indication of how much agreement or support each point received. This is particularly problematic for subjective topics where consensus is important.\n\nThe proposed solution, as mentioned in the documentation, is to translate the upvotes on comments into stars on the corresponding chat comments. This would preserve the community's indication of agreement or interest in specific points, making it easier to identify consensus and important information within the migrated discussion.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect as they address issues that aren't mentioned in the given documentation.

It uses array_diff() to determine which new options don't already exist.\n4. It only adds the non-duplicate options to the attribute.\n\nOption A doesn't check for duplicates and might add redundant values.\nOption C uses a different format for adding options, which is less flexible, and doesn't check for duplicates.\nOption D adds each option individually without checking for existing values, potentially creating duplicates."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/13", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5424", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/66/"], "docs_id": 5424, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One thing I've heard conflicting advice on is how to handle a job search for two people simultaneously; especially the strategy of things like: when do you mention your situation to the departments in question?

At times I brought this up when the chair first called me; more often I brought it up at the beginning of our face to face interview. My thinking was that I would not go anywhere that my wife could not find work, so it would be best to bring this issue up head on and find out how the university would respond.\n\nEverywhere I did this, I received a very positive and supportive response. Chairs and deans promoted the opportunities for my wife in their campuses and cities, and offered help in finding work.

It can be thought of as a ratio of inertial forces (which tend to keep the flow attached), and viscous forces (which help trigger separation).\n\nThe Mach number can also be important, but the flows shown in the question appear to be common low\\-speed flows for which it can be assumed constant (or even zero).\n\nWhen the speed of the oncoming flow is increased, the Reynolds number increases by the same factor. As the Reynolds number gets larger, boundary layers get thinner and viscous effects diminish, and eventually vanish. Inviscid flow solutions can be thought of as the\nlimiting solutions as the Reynolds number approaches infinity.\n\nThe figure below shows the computed pressure distributions about a conventional airfoil at a large angle of attack and two values of the Reynolds number (plus the inviscid result). Instead of plotting the dimensional values of the pressure (which would vary by large factors), I've shown the dimensionless pressure coefficients, which are more commonly used and are more useful for comparisons. The regions of nearly constant pressure in the aft regions are indicative of trailing\\-edge separation, and the one with higher Reynolds number has a much smaller separated region. (And of course, the separation is entirely absent in the inviscid solution.)\n\nIt can also be seen that the gradients in the pressure coefficients get smaller as the Reynolds number increases. This tendency plays a key role in the resulting change in separation. It would not make sense to use the trends in the dimensional pressure distributions to explain these tendencies, because opposite trends would be observed if the Reynolds number were increased by changing the size of the airfoil, instead of the speed of the flow.\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZKD4.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZKD4.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: As the airflow speed increases around an airfoil at a constant angle of attack in subsonic flow, what happens to the flow separation?\n\nA) Flow separation starts earlier (more upstream) due to increased air inertia\nB) Flow separation remains unchanged regardless of airflow speed\nC) Flow separation is delayed (moves downstream) due to increased Reynolds number\nD) Flow separation disappears completely at very high subsonic speeds\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: As airflow speed increases, the Reynolds number increases proportionally. Higher Reynolds numbers result in thinner boundary layers and reduced viscous effects. This leads to delayed flow separation, with the separation point moving further downstream on the airfoil surface. The pressure gradient also becomes less severe at higher Reynolds numbers, which further contributes to delaying separation. While it may seem counterintuitive, the increased inertia of the air at higher speeds actually helps the flow remain attached to the curved surface for a longer distance. Option A is incorrect because it goes against the behavior described in the explanation. Option B is incorrect because flow separation does change with airspeed. Option D is incorrect because while separation may be significantly delayed at very high Reynolds numbers, it doesn't completely disappear in real-world subsonic flows."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/17", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/187507", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/22069/"], "docs_id": 187507, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: And by \"different accounts\" I mean other email addresses (and *aliases*) that have been setup as *send* (or *send/recieve*) accounts within the one `outlook.com` account.\n\nFor example, within my `<me>@outlook.com` account at `outlook.com` I have configured the following accounts/email addresses from which I can send email, one of which is set as the default:\n\n* `<me>@example.com` (Default)\n* `<me>@example.org`\n* `<me>@example.net`\n\nHowever, when composing a new email on the Outlook iOS app I can only select from other accounts I have setup with the iOS app itself (by tapping in the \"From\" field).\n\nOn the Android Outlook.com app (and on the website) I can easily select from any of the above accounts/email addresses, as well as select the default account from which to send (in settings).

When an object literal is passed directly as an argument to a function, TypeScript performs strict excess property checks and will raise an error if the object contains properties not defined in the expected interface. However, when an object is first assigned to a variable and then passed to a function, TypeScript does not perform these checks, allowing excess properties to exist without raising an error. This behavior is by design, as TypeScript creators recognized the dynamic nature of JavaScript and the various use cases where additional properties might be present on objects."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/28", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/65931925", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/535965/"], "docs_id": 65931925, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I currently have a HTML of 3 main DIV.\n\nThe top DIV (green colour) contains an image with text beside it.\nI'm centering this DIV within the page.

When created, topology is created as a set of tables in a new schema: node, edge\\_data, face, and relation. Then you can start to add linestrings and polygons to the topology (using, for example,`TopoGeo_AddLineString()` and `TopoGeo_AddPolygon()`). These functions do the work of creating nodes, edges and faces in the topology as feature geometries are added and the intersections are detected.\n\nPostGIS topology supports topogeometries. These are geometries composed out of topology primitives (edges, nodes, faces) or other topogeometries. You can think, in the simplest case, of a topogeometry as the list of identifiers of shareable topology elements that constitute that feature. For example, a road centerline topogeometry would be a list of edges that might also be used as parts of faces forming neighbourhoods in a different table defining area topogeometries.\n\n[*PostGIS in Action, 3rd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/postgis-in-action-third-edition), Chapter 13, by Leo S. Hsu and Regina O. Obe, provides a good introductory overview of PostGIS topology, first using a simplified topology of Colorado divided by interstate highways and then using the neighbourhoods of Victoria, B.C. to demonstrate the ideas. (I'm not affiliated with the authors or the publisher \\- I have used it in a course)\n\nQGIS provides a handy viewer for PostGIS topology in its DB Manager interface (Schema \\-\\> TopoViewer).\n\nUpdate \\- example\n=================\n\nAll of the work below was done using psql, except for the use of QGIS to create the topology image (TopoViewer).\n\nCreate a pair of overlapping geometries.\n----------------------------------------\n\n```\n-- might need to disconnect / reconnect for postgis and topology paths to be picked up properly\n-- after creating these extensions and updating the search_path\nCREATE SCHEMA postgis;\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis SCHEMA postgis;\nALTER DATABASE set search_path=contrib,public,postgis,topology;\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;\n\n-- create table to hold overlapping polygons and then insert them\nCREATE TABLE poly (\n  id serial PRIMARY KEY,\n  geom Geometry(POLYGON, 32618)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO poly (geom) VALUES\n                        (ST_Polygon('LINESTRING(75 29, 77 29, 77 31, 75 31, 75 29)'::geometry, 32618)),\n                        (ST_Polygon('LINESTRING(76 30, 78 30, 78 32, 76 32, 76 30)'::geometry, 32618));\n\n```\n\nNow create a new topology and insert the geometries.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nResults in a new schema containing the required tables edge\\_data, face, node and relation.\n\n```\n-- create a topology and push geomtries from poly into it\nSELECT CreateTopology('polytopo', 32618);\n\nSELECT \n  id, \n  TopoGeo_AddPolygon('polytopo', geom) As face_id\n  FROM (\n    SELECT id, geom \n      FROM poly\n  ) As f;\n\n```\n\nInserting these polygons into the topology will result in updates to the topology tables. Using the QGIS TopoViewer and displaying the directed edges shows the following structure. There are three marked faces (1, 2 and 3\\) although there is actually a fourth \\- the universal face (0\\) not shown. Edges 1 through 6 are labelled and the grey circles are the topology nodes.\n\n[![View of topology created by inserting polygons](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1xXjv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1xXjv.png)\n\nList edges for faces.\n---------------------\n\nPostGIS topology includes constructor functions and topology accessors. To list the edge IDs for a specific face, use [`ST_GetFaceEdges()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GetFaceEdges.html). This dumps all edges for a given face (quoting from the documentation):\n\n> Enumeration of each ring edges start from the edge with smallest\n> identifier. Order of edges follows a left\\-hand\\-rule (bound face is on\n> the left of each directed edge).\n\nThe following query lists all edges for all faces. Here each edge is its own row. I'll aggregate the edges for each list into an ordered array below.\n\n```\n-- show ordered edges for faces\nWITH faces AS (\n  SELECT face_id FROM polytopo.face\n)\nSELECT face_id,\n       (ST_GetFaceEdges('polytopo', face_id)).*\n  FROM faces\n ORDER BY face_id, sequence;\n\n```\n\nThe result of the above is shown below. Negative edge IDs indicate that the ordered traversal would go against the direction of the edge to keep the bounded area to the left of the edge. For example, the traversal of the universal face (0\\) runs against the edge direction for all arcs because the face is outside the drawn faces and therefore left of the outer arcs only when traversing them in reverse.\n\n```\n face_id | sequence | edge \n---------+----------+------\n       0 |        1 |   -1\n       0 |        2 |   -2\n       0 |        3 |   -6\n       1 |        1 |    1\n       1 |        2 |   -5\n       1 |        3 |   -3\n       1 |        4 |    2\n       2 |        1 |    3\n       2 |        2 |    5\n       2 |        3 |    4\n       3 |        1 |   -4\n       3 |        2 |    6\n(12 rows)\n\n```\n\nList edges for each face as an ordered array (single row)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am not sure if this is more useful than the query above. Depends what you are trying to do. But this is more similar to the polygon\\-arc table in the original question so I show it.\n\n```\n-- show ordered edges for faces, grouped into ordered arrays\nWITH faces AS (\n  SELECT face_id FROM polytopo.face\n), oedges AS (\n  SELECT face_id,\n         (ST_GetFaceEdges('polytopo', face_id)).*\n    FROM faces\n)\nSELECT face_id, array_agg(edge) AS edge_ids\n  FROM oedges\n GROUP BY face_id\n ORDER BY face_id;\n\n```\n\nThe result form the above query is shown below. The logic of the ordered lists is the same as for the previous query. I've removed the sequence number from the display while creating an ordered array of edge IDs.\n\n```\n face_id |  edge_ids   \n---------+-------------\n       0 | {-1,-2,-6}\n       1 | {1,-5,-3,2}\n       2 | {3,5,4}\n       3 | {-4,6}\n(4 rows)\n\n```\n\nSummary\n=======\n\nWithin the topology, only the edge\\_data table contains the boundary geometries. The face table stores only face IDs and minimum bounding boxes. Those face IDs are used in the edge table to relate each edge to the faces bounded by that edge and to store information about sequencing of edges around faces (see the table definition for details). The node table stores point geometries that are, technically, a duplication of the arc endpoint vertices but a reasonable trade\\-off for efficiency. The relation table relates topology elements, especially edges, to application feature geometries (topogeometries, mentioned earlier) that can be composed from topology elements at the lowest layer or from other topogeometries to create layered relationships within the topology (e.g., \"blocks\" could be composed from \"parcels\" that are, in turn, topology faces bounded by topology edges). In the example above, no topogeometries have been created so the relation table is still empty.\n\nAs opposed to the creation of face edge lists, shown in the examples above, face boundary geometry can be (re)created using [`ST_GetFaceGeometry()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GetFaceGeometry.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In PostGIS topology, which of the following statements is true regarding the storage and representation of polygons?\n\nA) The face table stores complete polygon geometries for each face.\nB) The edge_data table contains boundary geometries, while the face table only stores face IDs and bounding boxes.\nC) Topogeometries are always composed of individual nodes and cannot be built from other topogeometries.\nD) The relation table directly stores the geometry of features composed from topology elements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect.

When I asked them where they got the phrase, they always say they learned it from their high school grammar lessons.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is probably due to difficulty with prepositions, for which it is harder to learn by rules than by experience! The preposition \"by\" is used in \"X by X\" where \"X\" is a noun to adverbially specify that the main verb is performed to each \"X\" in the context one at a time. Some examples are:\n\n> one by one (one at a time)\n> \n> \n> line by line (one line at a time)\n> \n> \n> case by case (one case at a time)\n> \n> \n> day by day (one day at a time)\n\nIn contrast, the adverbial phrase \"X to X\" specifies that the main verb is performed to the \"X\"s in the context from one to another. It need not imply that all \"X\"s are involved, but simply conveys the process of going from one to another, usually repeatedly.\n\n> \\[from] house to house (repeatedly out from a house into another)\n> \n> \n> \\[from] time to time (occasionally)\n> \n> \n> \\[from] cover to cover (start of a book to the end)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following phrases best describes a situation where a company evaluates employee performance individually, considering each employee's unique circumstances and contributions?\n\nA) Case to case\nB) Case by case\nC) Case for case\nD) Case after case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B) \"Case by case.\" This phrase indicates that each case (in this context, each employee's performance) is evaluated individually, one at a time. \n\n\"Case by case\" follows the pattern explained in the documentation where \"X by X\" is used to specify that something is done to each item in a set individually.

The key difference highlighted in the documentation is that the Hurwitz zeta function \u03b6(s,X) is periodic with respect to an imaginary number (specifically, it's a function of p^(-s)). This periodicity simplifies its analysis in several ways:\n\n1. It results in a periodic set of roots, meaning there are only finitely many roots to consider.\n2. The functional equation forces \u03b6(s,X) to essentially be a reciprocal polynomial in p^(-s), further simplifying its analysis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because both functions have functional equations.

The 3 subnets are connected using layer 3 switches (10\\.0\\.100\\.200, 10\\.1\\.100\\.200, 10\\.2\\.100\\.200\\), all of the machines on each subnet use the layer 3 switch as it's default gateway, which then directs the traffic to the real gateway which currently is 10\\.1\\.0\\.2\n\nI have recently configured a new gateway on 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, and have begun testing this new gateway, for my client machines on the 10\\.0\\.0\\.0/16 subnet this is not an issue, I simply changed the default gateway assigned via DHCP to these machines to the new address and the traffic went out through the new gateway instead of going to the layer 3 switch.\n\nI want to test this on another site as well, as we have different teams in each building who need access to different websites, and I want to make sure before we switch everything over that each team can access what they need to do their work.\n\nSo on a Windows workstation on the 10\\.2\\.0\\.0/16 network I tried setting the default gateway of the machine to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, I checked where the traffic went to and it still went out through the old gateway (using tracert to 8\\.8\\.8\\.8 it gets there but through the old gateway, using tracert 10\\.0\\.0\\.1, it reaches 10\\.0\\.0\\.1\\). I believe the default gateway setting is being overridden by the static route table on the layer 3 switches.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if it possible to set a static route on the machines in question so they can direct their gateway traffic to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 and avoid it being overridden by the Layer 3 switches.\n\nI used:\n\n```\nroute add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 if 0x2\n\n```\n\nThis was accepted by Windows, but repeating my tracert tests the traffic still goes out through the old gateway. I was hoping I could do:\n\n```\nroute add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 if 0x2\nroute add 10.0.0.1 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.100.200 if 0x2\nroute add 10.0.100.200 mask 0.0.0.0 10.2.100.200 if 0x2\n\n```\n\nBut this also failed, running the second and 3rd commands Windows reported:\n\n```\nThe route addition failed: The specified mask parameter is invalid. (Destination & Mask) != Destination.\n\n```\n\n**So I know the commands I am running won't work, but is it possible to force Windows to direct its traffic through the layer 3 switches to my new gateway or am I on a fruitless search?**\n\nIf I need to alter the static routes on the layer 3 switches I don't mind doing this, I have a maintenance window planned on Sunday anyway so I can do some tinkering then. I would rather not do this during working hours, for obvious reasons.\n\nJust to clarify the links between sites, each layer 3 switch has the following connections:\n\n```\ngateway     , fibre link 1, fibre link 2\n10.0.100.200,             , 192.168.10.1\n10.1.100.200, 192.168.20.1, 192.168.10.2\n10.2.100.200, 192.168.20.2,\n\n```\n\nSo in order for my traffic to get to 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 from 10\\.2\\.249\\.28 (my testing machine) it needs to go through 10\\.2\\.100\\.200 \\> 192\\.168\\.20\\.1 \\> 192\\.168\\.10\\.1 \\> 10\\.0\\.0\\.1\n\nThe layer 3 switches in question are Netgear FSM7326P and GSM7328FS.\n\n**If, as I am starting to suspect I cannot do this by setting the static routes within Windows, is it possible to define a static route for individual IP addresses on the layer 3 switches?** Since I am currently testing I only want traffic from the 3 or 4 machines I will configure for testing to go through the new gateway for now, I want all the other traffic to continue to flow as before.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A default gateway on a system defines which address on its local broadcast domain to send data for addresses which lie outside the directly connected subnets. Since 10\\.0\\.0\\.1 is outside of 10\\.2\\.0\\.0/16, a host on 10\\.2\\.0\\.0 still needs to know which address within 10\\.2\\.0\\.0 to send the packets to in order for it to be forwarded. Once the packet hits the gateway within 10\\.2\\.0\\.0, then it's up to that gateway how to handle it.\n\nCreative static routes based on access control lists may be possible, depending on your networking gear.\n\nIn my opinion, your best bet would be to connect the new router/gateway (10\\.0\\.0\\.1\\) to the other subnets. Depending on the hardware you are using, you can accomplish this with either additional physical links or a mutually compatible trunking protocol. Once you have your new gateway connected to all three subnets, you will be able to manually connect the other computers to test.\n\nThat said, I'm confused as to what exactly you're testing that requires all three of these /16s to be able choose multiple gateways. If you just want to make sure it works, your initial subnet test seems to confirm that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company uses three subnets (10.0.0.0/16, 10.1.0.0/16, and 10.2.0.0/16) connected by Layer 3 switches. A new gateway (10.0.0.1) has been configured, and the network administrator wants to test routing traffic from a workstation in the 10.2.0.0/16 subnet through this new gateway. Which of the following approaches is most likely to succeed in routing traffic from the 10.2.0.0/16 subnet to the new gateway at 10.0.0.1?\n\nA) Set the default gateway on the workstation to 10.0.0.1 and add a static route in Windows using the command: route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 if 0x2\n\nB) Configure static routes on the Layer 3 switches to direct traffic from specific IP addresses to the new gateway\n\nC) Add multiple static routes on the workstation to define the path through the Layer 3 switches to reach 10.0.0.1\n\nD) Connect the new gateway (10.0.0.1) directly to all three subnets using additional physical links or a compatible trunking protocol\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Connecting the new gateway (10.0.0.1) directly to all three subnets is the most effective solution. This approach allows the new gateway to be directly reachable from all subnets, bypassing the need for complex routing through the Layer 3 switches. \n\nOption A would fail because setting the default gateway to an address outside the local subnet (10.2.0.0/16) won't work without proper routing in place. \n\nOption B could potentially work but would require complex configuration on the Layer 3 switches and may not be scalable. \n\nOption C would not work because Windows rejected the attempt to add multiple static routes with the given syntax.\n\nOption D provides a direct and manageable solution that allows for easy testing and eventual implementation of the new gateway across all subnets."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/13", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/53284696", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/7785311/"], "docs_id": 53284696, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am having an issue with my fields generated with v\\-for, where the fields I have generated are affecting all the objects I am passing through the v\\-for loop.\n\nI have created a unique identifier for each object, but for some reason v\\-model is treating it as the same object.\n\nHere is the Vue snippet which outputs the generated fields:\n\n```\n<div class=\"row margin-15-bot margin-15-top\" v-for=\"(opportunity, index) in opportunities\">\n            <div class=\"col-3\">\n                <v-select :options=\"opportunityChoices\" v-model=\"opportunity.bookable_opportunity_ID\" placeholder=\"Select Charity\"></v-select>\n                <input title=\"Select an Opportunity\" :name=\"setOpportunityFieldName('bookable_opportunity_ID', index)\"\n                       :value=\"opportunity.bookable_opportunity_ID.id ? opportunity.bookable_opportunity_ID.id : 0\" type=\"text\" hidden/>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-2\">\n                <v-datepicker :name=\"setOpportunityFieldName('date', index)\" v-model=\"opportunity.date\" placeholder=\"Date\"></v-datepicker>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-2\">\n                <input type=\"time\" :name=\"setOpportunityFieldName('start_time', index)\" v-model=\"opportunity.start_time\" v-validate=\"'required'\"\n                       :class=\"{'vee-error-field' : errors.has(setOpportunityFieldName('start_time', index))}\" class=\"bnfo-database-fields-border\"\n                       step=\"900\" title=\"Shift Start Time\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-2\">\n                <input type=\"time\" :name=\"setOpportunityFieldName('end_time', index)\" v-model=\"opportunity.end_time\" v-validate=\"'required'\"\n                       :class=\"{'vee-error-field' : errors.has(setOpportunityFieldName('end_time', index))}\" class=\"bnfo-database-fields-border\" step=\"900\"\n                       title=\"Shift End Date\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-1\">\n                <input type=\"number\" :name=\"setOpportunityFieldName('max_par_req', index)\" v-model.number=\"opportunity.max_par_req\" v-validate=\"'required|min_value:1'\"\n                       :class=\"{'vee-error-field' : errors.has(setOpportunityFieldName('max_par_req', index))}\"\n                       class=\"bnfo-database-fields-border\" title=\"Shift's Maximum Participants\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-1 text-center\">\n                <v-delete-button :entries=\"opportunities\" :entry-key=\"index\"></v-delete-button>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n```\n\nHere is the object I am passing through the v\\-for as 'opportunities'\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqV6R.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqV6R.png)\n\nI would like the fields generated to update each object in 'opportunitues' independently via v\\-model.\n\nAny help or suggestions are greatly appreciated! ^^\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to include ctype.h, as follows:\n\n```\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n```\n\nThis header file declares the function `islower`:\n\n```\nint islower(int c);\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using v-for to generate form fields for multiple objects in Vue.js, what is the most likely cause of all objects being updated simultaneously instead of independently when a single field is changed?\n\nA) The v-model directive is not being used correctly on the form fields\nB) The objects in the array lack unique identifiers\nC) The v-for loop is not properly indexed\nD) Vue.js is treating all objects in the array as references to the same object\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe issue described in the question is a common problem in Vue.js when working with arrays of objects. Vue's reactivity system can sometimes treat all objects in an array as references to the same object, causing changes to one object to affect all others. This is especially true if the objects are created dynamically or have similar structures.\n\nA is incorrect because the v-model directive is being used correctly in the provided code snippet.\n\nB is incorrect because the question states that unique identifiers have been created for each object.\n\nC is incorrect because the v-for loop in the provided code is correctly indexed (v-for=\"(opportunity, index) in opportunities\").\n\nD is the correct answer because it accurately describes the behavior observed, where Vue is treating all objects in the array as if they were the same, despite having unique identifiers. This is a known issue in Vue when working with arrays of objects, and often requires special handling or the use of Vue.set() to ensure proper reactivity."}}
