One student is experiencing issues running the software in full-screen mode. Given the obsolescence of Turbo C and modern operating system constraints, what is the most appropriate solution that balances educational objectives, software compatibility, and real-world relevance?\n\nA) Install a virtual machine running Windows XP to ensure full Turbo C compatibility\nB) Use DOSBox to emulate a legacy environment for running Turbo C in full-screen\nC) Switch to a modern, open-source IDE and compiler like Code::Blocks with GCC\nD) Petition the school administration to provide older computers with Windows 98\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple factors including software compatibility, educational goals, and practical considerations in modern software development. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate solution because:\n\n1. It addresses the immediate problem of software incompatibility with Windows 7.\n2. It introduces students to modern, industry-standard development tools (Code::Blocks and GCC) that are relevant in today's software engineering landscape.\n3. It avoids perpetuating the use of obsolete technology (Turbo C) that is no longer supported or used in professional settings.\n4. It provides a sustainable solution that will work on current and future operating systems.\n\nOption A, while potentially solving the compatibility issue, introduces unnecessary complexity and doesn't address the core problem of using outdated software. Option B, using DOSBox, is a workable solution but still relies on emulation of obsolete technology, missing an opportunity to modernize the learning experience.

All I knew is, that I can declare variables like:\n\n```\nfoo=\"my dear friends\"\nbar[0]=\"one\"\nbar[1]=\"two\"\nbar[2]=\"three\"\n\n```\n\nor accessing them with a $ sign, like:\n\n```\necho $foo\necho ${bar[1]}\n\n```\n\nor using inbuilt variables, like:\n\n```\necho $PWD\nPATH=$PATH:\"/usr/bin/myProg\"\n\n```\n\nNow, I hear there are two (at least?) types of variables: shell variables and environment variables.\n\n* What is the purpose of having two different types?\n* How do I know which type a variable is?\n* What are the typical usages for each one?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Environment variables are a list of `name=value` pairs that exist whatever the program is (shell, application, daemon\u2026). They are typically inherited by children processes (created by a `fork`/`exec` sequence): children processes get their own copy of the parent variables.\n\nShell variables do exist only in the context of a shell. They are only inherited in subshells (i.e. when the shell is forked without an `exec` operation). Depending on the shell features, variables might not only be simple strings like environment ones but also arrays, compound, typed variables like integer or floating point, etc.\n\nWhen a shell starts, all the environment variables it inherits from its parent become also shell variables (unless they are invalid as shell variables and other corner cases like `IFS` which is reset by some shells) but these inherited variables are tagged as exported1. That means they will stay available for children processes with the potentially updated value set by the shell. That is also the case with variables created under the shell and tagged as exported with the `export` keyword.\n\nArray and other complex type variables cannot be exported unless their name and value can be converted to the `name=value` pattern, or when a shell specific mechanism is in place (e.g.: `bash` exports functions in the environment and some exotic, non POSIX shells like `rc` and `es` can export arrays).\n\nSo the main difference between environment variables and shell variables is their scope: environment variables are global while non exported shell variables are local to the script.\n\nNote also that modern shells (at least `ksh` and `bash`) support a third shell variables scope. Variables created in functions with the `typeset` keyword are local to that function (The way the function is declared enables/disables this feature under `ksh`, and persistence behavior is different between `bash` and `ksh`). See <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/28349/2594>\n\n1This applies to modern shells like `ksh`, `dash`, `bash` and similar. The legacy Bourne shell and non Bourne syntax shells like `csh` have different behaviors."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about shell and environment variables, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A DevOps engineer is debugging a complex shell script that manipulates various variables. The script creates an array variable 'config_paths' and a string variable 'log_dir', then calls an external program. Unexpectedly, the external program cannot access these variables. What is the most likely explanation for this behavior?\n\nA) The variables were not properly initialized in the shell script\nB) The external program is written in a language that doesn't support shell variables\nC) The variables were not exported as environment variables before calling the external program\nD) Array variables cannot be accessed by external programs, regardless of how they are set\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the difference between shell variables and environment variables, as well as their scope and inheritance. The key points are:\n\n1. Shell variables exist only in the context of a shell and are not automatically available to external programs.\n2. Environment variables are inherited by child processes, including external programs.\n3. To make a shell variable available to an external program, it needs to be exported as an environment variable.\n4. Array variables pose an additional challenge, as they cannot be directly exported in the standard name=value format of environment variables.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the variables were not exported as environment variables (option C). Even if they were properly initialized, they would remain as shell variables unless explicitly exported. \n\nOption A is incorrect because proper initialization doesn't guarantee availability to external programs. Option B is misleading; the language of the external program is not relevant to whether it can access environment variables. Option D is a common misconception; while array variables can't be directly exported in their full form, their individual elements can be exported if properly handled.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about variable scopes and process inheritance rather than simple memorization."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/06", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/56325", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/7514/"], "docs_id": 56325, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently discovered moisture in my attic and the mold inspector recommended sealing all the canned lights in our house.

The correct answer, B, is the most effective approach because:\n\n1.

This means that if you are referring to \"music\" in plural, you still call it \"music\" instead of \"musics\" (and you would say \"that music,\" not \"those music\"). Also, in your second sentence, you said \"\\[that is music] from a completely different culture that of your country culture.\" This sentence doesn't grammatically fit together; I suggest saying something like \"that is music from a completely different culture than that of your country's culture,\" because the word \"than\" compares the \"different culture\" and \"your country's culture\" (and the 's after country shows possession).\n\nThe sentence \"How do you feel about this music?\" is a question. You only use the word \"do\" like that in a question. \n\nThe sentence \"I wonder how you feel about this music\" is not question; it is as statement. You are not asking how the person feels about the music, you are simply saying that you wonder how they feel. Since it is not a question, you don't use the word \"do.\"\n\nAlso, I don't know the purpose of your letter, but **if** you are trying to get a response from the person you are addressing the letter to, I would suggest using the question version \"How do you feel about this music?\" If this doesn't apply to your letter just ignore my suggestion."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the usage of \"outside\" in English, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A language learner encounters the sentence: \"Outside his exceptional programming skills, John struggles with team communication.\" Which of the following best explains the usage and implications of \"outside\" in this context?\n\nA) The word \"outside\" is used incorrectly, and should be replaced with \"besides\" for grammatical accuracy.\nB) This usage of \"outside\" as a preposition meaning \"apart from\" is standard and commonly found in formal writing.\nC) \"Outside\" here represents a figurative extension of its spatial meaning, indicating an exception, but this usage is relatively uncommon.\nD) The sentence employs \"outside\" as an adverb modifying \"exceptional,\" emphasizing the extremity of John's skills.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the learner's ability to analyze nuanced language use and integrate multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer, C, recognizes that while \"outside\" is being used to mean \"apart from\" or \"except for,\" this usage is not standard or common, as indicated by its absence from major dictionary definitions.

Option B is wrong as the documentation explicitly states this usage is not standard or commonly found in dictionaries. Option D misinterprets the function of \"outside\" in the sentence, treating it as an adverb when it's actually functioning as a preposition.\n\nThis question requires learners to apply their understanding of figurative language, preposition usage, and the varying formality levels of English expressions.

Adding a cross brace made of 2x4 lumber to the back of the frame directly addresses this issue without overengineering other components. \n\nOption A, using 2x8 lumber for the main beams, would increase vertical load capacity but doesn't address the racking concern. Option C, increasing plywood thickness, might marginally improve overall stiffness but doesn't target the main structural weakness. Option D, rotating the frame, could potentially increase stability in one direction but might compromise it in another, and doesn't specifically address racking.\n\nThe cross brace (Option B) provides diagonal support, significantly enhancing the frame's resistance to lateral forces and improving overall structural integrity.

Why is this assumption wrong?\n\n**In other words:** the simplest prototypical examples of integrable billiards (rectangular, circular, elliptical) have some obvious symmetries allowing us to find two independent integrals of motion.

How can we distinguish two situations:\n\n1. there exist two independent integrals of motion, so the system is integrable, but their form is very complicated,\n2. the only integral of motion is $E$ and other independent integrals are absent?\n\n*I'm not a specialist in dynamical systems and related complicated mathematics, so any simple explanations will be appreciated. I've found the related questions [Idea of integrable systems](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/97706/) and [Non\\-integrability of the 2D double pendulum](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/142238/) but didn't get any simple answer.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think one must distinguish between chaotic \"Hamiltonian\" systems and chaotic dissipative systems. In the latter, the phase space volume is not conserved, so it is much more difficult to find \"integrals of motion\" because Liouville's theorem is broken. Remember, a quantity \"A\" is an integral of motion if \n\n$\\\\frac{dA}{dt} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t} \\+ \\\\{A,H\\\\} \\= 0$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian. For dissipative chaotic systems, you can't even write down $H$, so it is difficult to see how one could generally find integrals/constants of motion of the system. \n\nHowever, there is an important class of systems that show up in cosmology for example where you have Hamiltonian \"chaos\", where essentially the trajectories of the system exhibit all of the properties of chaos: sensitive dependence on initial conditions, diverging trajectories over time, but, the system still has attractors: a famous example is the dynamics of a closed anisotropic universe / Bianchi IX, in shameless self\\-promotion here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311\\.0389\\.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0389.pdf) (in particular, see Page 27\\)\nThis has of course led to wide debates for years in the cosmology community of whether this is \"Really\" chaos, since, in principle, the trajectories are predictable, but, I hope this answers your question.\n\nFurther, with respect to your Billiards problem / the famous Hadamard billiards, as you can see it is the same as the diagram on Page 27\\. Therefore, the billiard problem is also an example of *Hamiltonian* / deterministic / non\\-dissipative chaos. The phase space has an asymptotic attractor. This hopefully demonstrates that integrals of motion such as the one you found above ($E$ is the total energy of the system, and in this case, is the Hamiltonian, $H$) are only really possible if one can write down a Hamiltonian by Liouville's theorem."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about chaotic systems and billiards, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is studying a new type of billiard system and observes behavior that appears chaotic.

The correct answer, C, is the most effective approach because:\n\n1. Examining the phase space structure for invariant tori is a key method to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. In integrable systems, the phase space is foliated by invariant tori (as per the KAM theorem), while in chaotic systems, these structures break down.\n\n2.

Which of the following modifications would most likely allow the engineer to correctly read all 16 bits over SPI while minimizing changes to the existing circuit?\n\nA) Remove the pull-up resistors and connect SLOAD and RCK directly to VCC\nB) Tie SLOAD low and pulse RCK high before each SPI read operation\nC) Remove the pull-up resistors and tie both SLOAD and RCK to ground\nD) Keep the pull-up resistors, tie SLOAD high, and toggle RCK for each bit read\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the existing circuit and application of SPI and shift register concepts. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. SLOAD (Shift/Load) is used to parallel load data into the shift registers. Tying it low ensures the registers are in shift mode, ready for serial output.\n\n2. RCK (Register Clock) is used to latch the parallel inputs. Pulsing it high before each SPI read operation ensures that the most current data is loaded into the registers.\n\n3. Keeping the pull-up resistors maintains the circuit's original input behavior, where a low input to the shift register results in a high output.\n\n4. This solution allows reading all 16 bits over SPI by shifting out the data after the parallel load, which is initiated by the RCK pulse.\n\nOption A is incorrect because tying SLOAD and RCK to VCC would keep the registers in load mode, preventing serial output. Option C is incorrect because removing the pull-ups would change the input logic and tying both control pins low would prevent proper operation. Option D is incorrect because keeping SLOAD high would prevent shifting, and toggling RCK for each bit is unnecessary and would disrupt the serial output.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of shift register operation, SPI communication, and the ability to analyze and modify existing circuits while considering real-world constraints."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/22", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/136998", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/55765/"], "docs_id": 136998, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Please, reason before looking on the answer or my arguments so you don't become biased.**\n\nI'm studying for a test and there is this passage (content taken from British Council study material):\n\n> Identity crime is a generic term used to describe offences in which\n>  someone uses a fabricated or fictitious identity, a manipulated\n>  identity (the alteration of one\u2019s own identity) or a stolen identity to\n>  commit a crime.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The current 250W PSU is below the GPU's recommended minimum, suggesting it may be struggling to provide adequate power.\n2.

I originally had intended only to scrape down the popcorn finish and have it skim coated, so I did not initially try and remove the molding. Once I got down to the original plaster and saw the extent of the repairs that would be needed, I decided it was going to be more cost effective to just replace it. I had already draped the room in plastic from the molding down, and it was looking tough to get a pry bar in there, so I left it figuring I could remove the majority of the ceiling and then remove it when I had access from above.\n\nWell now I have that access, but it still looks to be a challenge:\n\n* It is 85 years old, and while it's in great aesthetic condition, in reality, the wood is dried and quite fragile. If I try to remove it, I'm likely to end up damaging some pieces.\n* The bottom portion of the molding is flush with the plaster walls and it is nailed directly into the lath, maybe even glued? When I tried to gently pry it off, the whole plaster surface moved along with the molding.\n\nSo given this, I'm wondering if I can get away with installing the drywall *without* removing the molding? There is 3/4\" of space between the joists and the molding, so 1/2\" drywall would fit fine, and due to slight unevenness in the joists I need to shim down about 1/4\" anyway.\n\nIs this a terrible idea, or does anybody have tricks for gently removing old crown molding from plaster? It would be easier to hang the drywall with the molding off, as I could strap the ceiling and shim the strapping. As is, if I did this I guess I would have to shim the joists themselves with plywood strips.\n\nEDIT: The crown molding is stained oak, which means pretty much any nick shows and damage of any substantial size is tough to re\\-stain to the right color. I am pretty attached to it, so I'd prefer to keep it intact.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Go ahead and place the drywall over the top edge of the crown moulding. Sounds like the wall was already re\\-plastered with it in place. If you tried to remove it, you may end up re\\-doing the walls as well. Even forgetting that, it's almost impossible to remove moulding without sustaining some loss. Without replacement material available, removal with intents of preservation is extremely risky, especially with stain grade material. You don't want to go there.\n\nIf your joists were flat, you'd still only need to shim down the first 4 feet or so along the walls, no one will see the resulting slight slope. Keep this in mind when planning your shims. It doesn't have to be perfectly flat, unless that gives you pleasure. You also don't need to shim to completely fill the gap. An 1/8\" gap makes a clean shadow line that is not detrimental (assuming it is perfectly uniform) at all. It also makes finishing easier. The taped joints of drywall are normally not perfectly flat, despite the tapered edges. There is a slight bulge which is usually invisible. But against straight moulding, depending on the profile, this bulge may be visible. You might consider grinding down the edge tapers at the board corners against the wall so the joint tape can be completely buried and the yet the joint against the moulding can still be perfectly flat."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is replacing a failing plaster ceiling with drywall in an 85-year-old finished basement.

If this is the case how is Cross Validation different than this procedure? For example in a Ridge or Lasso regression setting I am still generating a bunch of models (indexed by $\\\\lambda$) and evaluating them on unseen data segment and choosing the best one.\n\nIt seems to me that CV works well with standard regularization methods like Ridge and Lasso is because the tried models are somewhat nested (i.e. Ridge is ordered by Rademacher complexity). Hence the Structural Risk Minimization principle kicks in. Otherwise CV looks like a dead end effort. If we use cross validation to compare bunch of unrelated models we will end up with the random model generation scenario that I described above.\n\nUnder the Structural Risk Minimization framework, for example in SVM, one bounds the error and reduces the model complexity.

CV is just a scheme how to retain independent cases to test some model.\n\nNote that if you select a model based on the CV results, this **model selection procedure** (including the CV) **is actually part of your training**. \n\nYou need to do an independent validation (rather, verification) of that final model (for which you can again use *another* CV as a strategy to retain cases independent of the training \\- see nested cross validation) in order to obtain a reliable estimate of its generalization performance. \n\nTo reiterate: the problem is not the CV, the problem is the data\\-driven model optimization (selection). \n\n> From this perspective random model generation should in theory overfit less than a penalized regression as my evaluation is on a bigger unseen data segment.\n\nThis I don't understand: why would the unseen data size differ?\n\n> Is there something in CV procedure that somehow mitigates the multiple testing problem?\n\nNo. \n\nThe only property of CV that slightly helps with multiple testing compared to a single split is that CV eventually tests all available cases, and is thus subject to somewhat smaller variance uncertainty due to the limited number of tested cases.

The correct answer is C because the procedure described is essentially performing an extensive search over a large model space (random models) and selecting the best one based on cross-validation performance. This process itself becomes part of the training procedure and can lead to overfitting on the cross-validation sets.\n\nThe question requires integrating multiple concepts:\n1. The role of cross-validation in model evaluation\n2. The concept of model selection as part of the training process\n3. The potential for overfitting when performing extensive model searches\n\nOption A is incorrect because random model generation isn't a form of regularization; it's an unguided search through model space. Option B is a misconception; cross-validation is a valid technique, but its results can be misused. Option D is plausible but unlikely; even if the relationships were simple, randomly generated models would not consistently perform well.\n\nThis question challenges the test-taker to think critically about the limitations of cross-validation when used for model selection, especially in scenarios involving large numbers of model comparisons.

With three mods, if one is away, the other two are there to deal with issues. As far as SO is concerned, it should be readily apparent that SO doesn't need 100 mods.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we need 216 mods for 71 sites.

On a site like Programmers, 45 times more new avid users (200\\+ rep) then there are active moderators are added every two weeks. Even on our least performing sites (e.g. Literature), regular users outnumber moderators 197 to 1\\.\n\nA site like Programmers also generates 1,000 flags a month: about 10 flags a day for each active moderator. Combined with staying active on the site's meta, TL, and here, there's a lot of time spent per day for something that's entirely volunteer. Throw in the massive amount of effort by Stack Exchange to streamline and improve moderator tools for Stack Overflow and the other Stack Exchange sites because [the moderator load has been *too high*](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101431/should-stack-overflow-moderators-have-a-standard-of-duty), and the conclusion one ought to reach is that we need *more* moderators, not less.\n\nAnd beyond that, each moderator is expected to be completely versed in their own site's activity and policies and be *trusted* members of the community: we're entrusted to act with a large amount autonomy and privileges because of that.\n\nYou say the solution is to start combining moderators: beyond the work each moderator does on their own site, they need to do it on other sites where they aren't trusted or possibly even active. How do you expect that to go? Everyone gets double the work and half the trust they have now, for what? Because you think 200 moderators sounds like a lot of people?\n\nThe overhead for having a few moderators per site is offset many times over by how it makes it so much easier for everyone that there are people willing to take the time to get heavily invested in a specific community to help guide and moderate it. I don't know why you'd want to look a gift horse in the mouth like that.\n\nAs to the suggestion that there are too many sites: on what basis? Have you *been* to Area 51 or *any* of the other sites? Each site was created because there was enough critical mass to create a specific audience about a topic. Most sites have been able to get traction precisely *because* the experts for those sites would not or could not contribute to a more general site. Most sites on the network are active and have found successful niches that are working for them with hundreds of questions and thousands of users.\n\nConsider the person who looks at the price of an economy car and sees $9,000\\. He says, \"Whoa, that's a lot of money! Why does it cost so much? I don't want to spend that much.\" Costs so much compared to what? Other new cars? No, that's on the low end. Other modes of transportation? Sure, but you don't get the benefits of the car. You want to pay less, you don't get the car.\n\nIn the same vein, 200 moderators and 70 sites sounds like a lot when they're taken completely out of context. But if you look at what's been built over the past 2 years, it's a small price to pay for what we've gotten. You don't want this many sites and this many moderators?

The correct answer, A, demonstrates the appropriate use of \"would\" in a hypothetical context, similar to the excerpt. \n\nOption A uses \"would\" to express a conditional or hypothetical future action, contingent on being elected. This mirrors the excerpt's use of \"would\" for a hypothetical scenario.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are distractors that represent common misconceptions:\n\nB incorrectly uses \"would\" for a weather prediction, where \"will\" is more appropriate as it's a statement about the future based on current data.\n\nC correctly uses \"will\" for a strong prediction or promise about the future, contrasting with the hypothetical nature of \"would.\"\n\nD also correctly uses \"will\" for a scientific prediction based on evidence, again contrasting with the hypothetical use of \"would.\"\n\nThis question tests the learner's ability to analyze language use in context, apply grammatical rules to real-world scenarios, and distinguish between degrees of certainty in statements. It goes beyond mere memorization, requiring critical thinking about language and its implications in various professional contexts."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/27", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/9812", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/121/"], "docs_id": 9812, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is V.A.T.S in Fallout 3?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's the system in which you can pause the action a take aim at specific body parts, with known percentage of hitting them, and with each action costing a specific amount of \"action points\" (AP).\n\nIt stands for \"Vault\\-Tec Assisted Targeting system\", but mostly it\n\n* Gives a more cinematic feel when using it, due to the slow\\-motion action sequence after choosing a target.\n* Makes the game closer to earlier, turn\\-based Fallout games in which you could target specific body parts with known percentages, paying with action points, in a very similar way.\n* Gives the game a more RPG\\-ish, tactical feel than a typical shooter.\n* Makes the game easier / less stressful.\n\nYou can read more about it on [Wikia's Fallout](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Assisted_Targeting_System), [Gamespy](http://planetfallout.gamespy.com/wiki/Fallout_3_VATS) and even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3#V.A.T.S.)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about V.A.T.S. in Fallout 3, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating a new post-apocalyptic RPG and wants to implement a combat system inspired by Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. Which combination of features would best capture the essence and purpose of V.A.T.S. while balancing gameplay and nostalgia?\n\nA) Real-time targeting with slow-motion effects and randomized hit chances\nB) Turn-based combat with body part targeting and a separate currency for special moves\nC) Pause-and-play system with limb targeting, percentage-based accuracy, and action point costs\nD) Bullet-time mechanic with automated targeting and regenerating special ability meter\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the V.A.T.S. concept to a new game design scenario. The correct answer, C, best captures the essential elements of V.A.T.S. as described in the documentation:\n\n1. Pause-and-play system: This reflects the ability to \"pause the action\" as mentioned in the documentation.\n2. Limb targeting: This corresponds to the ability to \"take aim at specific body parts.\"\n3. Percentage-based accuracy: This aligns with the \"known percentage of hitting them\" aspect.\n4. Action point costs: This matches the system where \"each action costing a specific amount of 'action points' (AP).\"\n\nThis combination most effectively balances gameplay elements with nostalgia for earlier Fallout games. It maintains the \"RPG-ish, tactical feel\" while differentiating from typical shooters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it lacks the pause feature and action point system, which are crucial to V.A.T.S.\n\nOption B is fully turn-based, which doesn't capture the hybrid nature of V.A.T.S. that allows pausing within real-time combat.\n\nOption D introduces a bullet-time mechanic and automated targeting, which don't align with the strategic, player-controlled targeting that V.A.T.S. offers.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the core components of V.A.T.S. and apply them to a new game design context, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and critical thinking about game design principles."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/03/09", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/367410", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/265402/"], "docs_id": 367410, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our current business process is that the domain experts will write down the business logic in a Word document, and developers will try to reflect those logic as closely as possible with the implementation. \n\nThis process violates the DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle, and thus creates many problems that are associated with violating DRY principle.\n\nThere is no programmatical way of determining if the change in the domain document is correctly reflected in the code base. This forces very close\\-knit communication between the domain expert and the developer, which causes other problems such as the document resembling more of the tech specifications rather than the domain specifications and frequent meetings if any part of the document needs to be updated. \n\nNote that I am a developer, and I am not looking to introduce a solution that requires an adoption of a software approach by anyone but me. I am trying to find a simple solution that can be handled by a single developer.\n\nI've done my research and have encountered some suggested solutions such as domain specific language or domain driven design, but they don't fit my needs for the following reasons: \n\n* DSL: This requires the adoption on the DE's part to use the DSL. I can use DSL to implement the domain logic using DSL, but this doesn't resolve the underlying problem of separation between domain document and implementation. Also, I do not want to limit domain expert's ability to express domain problem to specifically DSL. I want them to be able to use natural English.\n* DDD: A bit better than DSL in that only the ubiquitous language needs to be developed, but this still requires explaning the concept of DDD to everyone involved.\n\nIn essence, I am looking for a simple solution that can be contained by a single developer.

It should also be free of anything technical that distracts from focusing on high level policy.\n\nWe're not at the point where you can force the domain expert to write actual business logic. But if you do it right they can read it and tell you if you forgot something or are doing something wrong.\n\nSo yes, that word document will get outdated. That's fine. It shouldn't be kept current.

With drywall you might be able to go with a rough location and cut the edges while the board is held or lightly screwed into the wall, but that probably won't work with something as rigid as plywood.\n\nThe opening in the wallboard should be sized to the electrical box. Then the cover plate helps you hide any gaps. One handyman tip is that they sell extra\\-large cover plates to help hide sloppier cuts!\n\nYou can also buy tools designed to help mark these cuts:\n[https://www.amazon.com/Calculated\\-Industries\\-8105\\-Drywall\\-Electrical/dp/B00YX8KZGO/](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00YX8KZGO)\nor\n[https://www.amazon.com/HandyMark\\-Drywall\\-Marker\\-2\\-Pack\\-HM1002\\-BF/dp/B000V5MPZM/](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000V5MPZM)\n\nOne last idea if your cuts are significantly off is to replace the electrical boxes.

However, I often wonder: is this necessary? Could I simply stand around the corner and shoot flames?\n\nThe reason that I am uncertain about the answer is that, sometimes, when I blast my flamethrower around a corner, it almost \"repels\" against the corner of the wall, e.g. here:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wt3JM.jpg)\nand, other times, it goes **through** the (other side of the) wall, e.g. here:![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bTzN4.jpg)\n\nIn either of these cases, would the flamethrower do damage to, say, a Sentry in the corner of the wall (roughly where my flamethrower is aimed)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is... it depends.\n\nFlamethrowers actually fire a stream of particles in a roughly conic shape.\n\nWalls in Source are weird if they're thin. They may or may not block weapons fired close to walls... this is most noticeable with explosive weapons, but also affects other projectile weaponry (including the Flamethrower's particles). This is why, if you angle the flamethrower correctly, you can burn enemies through the setup gates on certain maps.\n\nEven in areas where walls are thicker, if you and the sentry are near a corner, you can sometimes hit that sentry due to the short width of walls near corners combined with the fire's cone shape."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about flamethrowers in Team Fortress 2, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Team Fortress 2 player is attempting to destroy a sentry gun placed in the corner of a room using their flamethrower from around a corner.

The correct answer, C, is based on several key points:\n\n1. The documentation states that flamethrowers fire a stream of particles in a \"roughly conic shape.\"\n2.

The answer is *because the text height is not a multiple of line height*.\n\nThis is usually ignored for TeX documents because paragraphs are short or there is other stretchable glue made by displayed equations or lists so there isn't a *line grid* on the page anyway.\n\nIn your concrete example, the annoying space vanishes if you force text height to be a multiple of line height, for instance\n\n```\n\\usepackage{calc}\n\n\\usepackage[paper=a4paper,twoside=true,lmargin=4cm,\nrmargin=4cm,bindingoffset=0cm,textheight=45\\baselineskip+\\topskip]{geometry}\n\n```\n\nAdding `\\topskip` is neccessary because the first line doesn't occupy a full `\\baselineskip`.\n\n![example image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaDu3.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided LaTeX documentation and explanation, here's a challenging question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A technical writer is preparing a long document using LaTeX and notices inconsistent spacing between paragraphs on different pages, particularly on page 3.

Option B directly addresses this by modifying the geometry package settings to ensure the text height is a multiple of line height plus \\topskip.

It (0\\.3\\) can not be the unconditional probability of being paid in October, because this would imply the unconditional probability of being paid is at least $1\\.2 \\= 0\\.2 \\+ 0\\.7 \\+ 0\\.3$. Therefore, no further adjustment is in order to get the conditional probability of being paid in October given not being paid in September.\n\nOn the other hand, the $0\\.7$ probability of being paid in September was stated as being an unconditional probability; hence your calculation to get the conditional probability of being paid in September given not being paid in August.\n\nYour calculation to determine the probability of being paid in September, given not being paid in August, is correct. As a partial check of your calculation, note that if the unconditional probabilities of being paid in August and September were $0\\.2$ and $0\\.8$ respectively, rather than $0\\.2$ and $0\\.7$, the corresponding calculation to what you did would result in a probability of being paid in September, given not being paid in August, of 1, which of course is as it must be given the unconditional probability of being paid in August or September being equal to $1$ .\n\nAs a practical note, if this is just a hypothetical (theoretical) exercise, fine (\"in a variation of the problem\" doesn't sound like the way you'd describe a real\\-world situation). But if this is your real\\-life situation, I don't trust the probabilities provided by your friend for a variety of reasons, even if he is basically honest.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the difference in coefficient shrinkage between these two methods as the penalty term \u03bb increases?\n\nA) Ridge regression shrinks all coefficients proportionally, while LASSO shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero\nB) Both Ridge and LASSO shrink coefficients by the same factor of D\u00b2/(D\u00b2+\u03bb)\nC) LASSO always shrinks coefficients more aggressively than Ridge regression\nD) Ridge regression can shrink coefficients to zero, but LASSO cannot\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts and application of knowledge to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is A because it accurately describes the key difference between Ridge and LASSO regression in terms of coefficient shrinkage.\n\nRidge regression shrinks all coefficients proportionally by a factor of D\u00b2/(D\u00b2+\u03bb), where D is the diagonal matrix of A, and \u03bb is the penalty term. As \u03bb increases, all coefficients are reduced but typically don't reach exactly zero.\n\nLASSO regression, on the other hand, has the unique property of shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero as \u03bb increases. This is evident from the condition provided by Knight & Fu (2000): \u03b2\u0302_lasso = 0 if and only if -\u03bbI \u2264 2\u2211YiXi \u2264 \u03bbI. This inequality shows that for sufficiently large \u03bb, some coefficients will be forced to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the D\u00b2/(D\u00b2+\u03bb) shrinkage factor to both methods, when it only applies to Ridge regression.\n\nOption C is a common misconception. While LASSO can shrink some coefficients to zero, it doesn't always shrink more aggressively than Ridge for all coefficients.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it reverses the properties of Ridge and LASSO. Ridge typically doesn't shrink coefficients to exactly zero, while LASSO does.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze and compare two related but distinct regularization techniques, requiring a deep understanding of their mathematical properties and practical implications in statistical modeling."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2023/01/19", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/601743", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/204489/"], "docs_id": 601743, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> The prospect of finding a job in this field is \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 .\n\nI am looking for a verb for the above sentence to mean the prospect is \u2018getting worse\u2019 or \u2018worsening\u2019.

While it suggests a negative trend, it doesn't necessarily mean an absolute decrease in jobs (option A) or a deterioration in job quality (option C). The term \"declining\" often refers to a gradual decrease or downward trend, which in the context of job prospects, is most likely to indicate that the rate of growth in opportunities is slowing down (option B).

Of course, I used the EFI partition and installed the bootloader on an external SSD.\n\nAfter installation, and upon rebooting, in the UEFI I found 2 boot entries \"Ubuntu\". Each of them works great: Kubuntu loads and works. But, when I choose UEFI boot entry \"UEFI TS512\\...\" (the label of my external SSD), for a moment (less than second) the string `Couldn't open /EFI/BOOT/fallback.efi 14` appears and then it changes to a screen showing `Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported`. \n\nSo, what do I need to do in order to make this system work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your SSD is considered \"removable media\" by UEFI, so the place for the bootloader which UEFI runs is actually /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi from the SSD's EFI partition. You might have to copy the Ubuntu bootloader(s) from /EFI/ubuntu there and rename them to bootx64\\.efi. If you are running secure boot, copy /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi and also copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/grubx64\\.efi (that's the signed version). Without secure boot, just copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi (the unsigned version). The grub.cfg file should be in /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg (and that should be just a 3 liner which brings in the maintained grub.cfg from the regular /boot/grub location.\n\n---\n\nThe removable media's EFI partition is set up just like the hard disk's EFI. FAT filesystem, flagged bootable, (and created with the efi type, \"ef\", check the type list, might have zeros too in some tools). Look at the live install media, it meets the criteria. (FAT filesystem, flagged bootable, directory /EFI/Boot, efi bootloader).\n\n---\n\nWith the SSD booting alone, you might have to edit the grub.cfg files after you add two hard disks. The two grub.cfg files are in (EFI partition)/EFI/ubuntu.grub.cfg (a three liner) and /boot/grub/grub.cfg (the full config file). Change any hd0 references to hd2 (assuming the hard disks now get 0 and 1\\), and if you see any /dev/sda references, change those to /dev/sdc...

The correct solution involves copying the appropriate bootloader files to this expected location. \n\nOption C is the most comprehensive solution because:\n1. It copies shimx64.efi (renamed to bootx64.efi) which is necessary for secure boot compatibility.\n2. It also copies grubx64.efi, which is needed for the actual boot process.\n3. This setup works for both secure boot and non-secure boot systems, as the shim loader will chain-load grub in secure boot environments, while in non-secure boot systems, the firmware can directly load grub.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it limits compatibility and doesn't address the root cause.

Given that static HTML files in this directory load without issues, but PHP files fail to execute with a \"failed to open stream\" error, what is the most likely root cause and appropriate solution?\n\nA) Apache's mod_rewrite is incorrectly handling Unicode characters, and needs to be reconfigured with appropriate flags.\nB) PHP's file system functions are using Windows ANSI API, unable to handle Unicode, requiring a symbolic link workaround.\nC) The server's character encoding is set incorrectly, and changing Apache's AddDefaultCharset directive will resolve the issue.\nD) Windows file system permissions are blocking PHP's access to Unicode paths, necessitating explicit NTFS ACL modifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue lies in the interaction between Apache, PHP, and the Windows file system when dealing with non-ASCII characters in file paths. While Apache is capable of handling the Unicode path and serving static files correctly, PHP's file system functions are using the Windows ANSI API, which cannot properly handle Unicode characters.\n\nThis explains why static HTML files load without issues (handled directly by Apache), but PHP files fail to execute (PHP can't locate the file due to Unicode handling limitations). The error message \"failed to open stream: No such file or directory\" is indicative of PHP's inability to correctly interpret the file path with accented characters.\n\nThe most appropriate solution is to create an NTFS symbolic link (option B) that provides an ASCII-only path to the problematic directory.

If the target value is greater than the middle element, the left half of the list is eliminated from the search space, and the search continues in the right half.

Quantifiers are a form of Determiner (another POS), and they \"bind\" noun phrases, which means they modify and quantify them. Like most noun modifiers, quantifiers are naturally found before the noun they modify.\n\nLike many quantifiers, however, *each* is subject to a syntactic rule called \"Quantifier Shift\" (aka \"Quantifier\\-Float\" or \"Q\\-Float\"), which moves a quantifier from a prenominal position to an adverbial position:\n\n* ***Each*** of the boys said they would go. \\=\\= Q\\-Float \\=\\=\\> *The boys **each** said they would go.*\n\nQ\\-Float applies to the quantifier *all* as well as *each*, but **not** to the quantifier *every*:\n\n* ***All*** the boys said they would go. \\=\\= Q\\-Float \\=\\=\\> *The boys **all** said they would go.*\n* *Every boy said he would go*. \\=\\= Q\\-Float \\=\\=\\> *\\*The boy(s) every said he/they would go.*\n\nAs to the question...\n\nIn the first sentence in the question, *that each have 4 strokes* is a relative clause modifying *letters*, with *that* as the subject relative marker, and a Q\\-Floated *each*. \n\nIn the second sentence, *each has 4 strokes* is half of a compound sentence, a main clause with *each* as its subject. \n\n*Each* (and, again, *all*, but not *every*) can act as a pronoun substituting for (in this case) *each letter*, in the same way *this* can substitute for *this letter*."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the usage of \"each\" in English grammar, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A linguistics professor is explaining the concept of Quantifier Shift to her students.

The correct answer, B, accurately captures the nuances of Quantifier Shift and the unique properties of different quantifiers.\n\nSentences 1 and 2 demonstrate the Quantifier Shift rule applied to \"each\".

Written for ecologists , I think this is one of the best books on practical data analysis regardless of background, I'm an engineer and I have used it a lot. I'm sure there are other mathematical statistics book, however this book is by far the most practical book that I have read. He also has a package [BBMLE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle/index.html) which you might want to check. \nThe book unlike any other goes in to maximum likelihood estimation, profile likelihood and confidence interval estimation and all that.\n\nComing back to your problem, you need to write a log\\-likelihood of the function that you are trying to fit the data. Obviously you are assuming the error to be normally distributed as in the simulation, so the Log likelihood is:\n\n$Log\\\\ Likelihood (Lambda,sd) \\= \\-\\\\frac{n}{2} log(sd) \\- \\\\frac{n}{2} log(2\\\\pi)\\- \\\\frac{(y\\-x^{Lambda})^2}{2sd} $\n\nYou need to maximize the above equation using an optimization routine such as `optim` in `R`. Use the `Hessian` matrix from the optimization to assess the uncertainty of your estimated log likelihood function i.e., how steep or how flat the curvature of your function is at the optimal point. If the function is steep which implies less uncertainties at optimal point you would have a tighter confidence band on your parameter estimates, on the other hand if its flat you would have a wider confidence interval.

Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for providing a comprehensive analysis of the parameter estimate and its uncertainty?\n\nA) Use bootstrap resampling to generate confidence intervals for \u03bb\nB) Apply Bayesian estimation with informative priors on \u03bb\nC) Utilize the Hessian matrix from optimization to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals\nD) Perform cross-validation to assess the model's predictive performance with different \u03bb values\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate approach based on the given documentation is to utilize the Hessian matrix from optimization to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals (option C). This method directly aligns with the top answer's recommendation and provides a statistically rigorous way to assess uncertainty.\n\nThe explanation in the documentation outlines a process where:\n1. A log-likelihood function is defined for the model.\n2. The `optim` function in R is used to maximize this log-likelihood, obtaining point estimates for \u03bb and \u03c3\u00b2.\n3. The Hessian matrix is requested from the optimization (hessian = T in the optim call).\n4. The inverse of the Hessian (Fisher Information Matrix) is used to calculate standard errors.\n5. These standard errors are then used to construct confidence intervals.\n\nThis approach provides not just a point estimate, but also a measure of uncertainty (confidence intervals) derived from the curvature of the log-likelihood function at the optimum. It directly addresses the questioner's desire for \"statistical asymptotic results such as CI.\"\n\nWhile the other options have merits, they are not specifically mentioned or recommended in the given documentation:\n- Bootstrap resampling (A) can be useful but may be computationally intensive and doesn't leverage the theoretical properties of maximum likelihood estimation.\n- Bayesian estimation (B) is a different paradigm and wasn't discussed in the answer.\n- Cross-validation (D) assesses predictive performance rather than parameter uncertainty, which wasn't the main focus of the question.\n\nTherefore, option C best represents the comprehensive approach outlined in the documentation for estimating \u03bb and quantifying its uncertainty."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/08", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/89378", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/33248/"], "docs_id": 89378, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Which of the following sentences are correct?\n\n> Mainlanders were actually more likely to be arrested than native ***Indians***\n> \n> \n> Mainlanders were actually more likely to be arrested than native ***Indians were***\n\nPlease explain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both sentences are correct and idiomatic, but the first (without \u201cwere\u201d) is more common.\n\nIn English, there is a lot of flexibility as to what can be omitted.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Templates in C++ are typically implemented entirely in header files. This is because the compiler needs to see the full template definition to instantiate it for specific types.\n\n2. Constexpr functions, which are evaluated at compile-time, also require their full definitions to be visible to the compiler at the point of use.\n\n3. Separating template definitions into .cpp files (as in options A, C, and D) can lead to linker errors or missed optimizations:\n   - Option A's explicit instantiation approach would require knowing all possible template arguments in advance, which is often impractical and defeats the purpose of templates.\n   - Option C's extern template approach can reduce compile times but doesn't solve the fundamental issue of needing the definition available for instantiation.\n   - Option D's linker script approach is not a standard C++ feature and wouldn't solve the compile-time requirements of constexpr.\n\n4.

A Windows and Linux user before, I'm now getting quite used to the differences with using Apple's desktop environment.\n\nOne thing that is still slowing me down a little is the requirement to explicitly click in an application window to make it active, before the UI elements inside that window can be interacted with.\n\nFor example, if I have two browser windows open side by side with the left one active, it takes two clicks to follow a link in the right hand window: one to make the window active, one to click the link.\n\nThis is in contrast to Windows or Linux, where you can click on a UI element in a inactive window and that single click will both activate the window and the element in it.\n\nA similar issue is trying to copy and paste text between windows.

The starting point is usually a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,h)$. Then $M$ can be foliated by surfaces $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ of constant $t$, where $t$ is a global time coordinate i.e. a $C^1$ function $t:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}$ such that the 1\\-form $dt$ is non\\-vanishing and everywhere timelike: $h^{\\-1}(dt,dt)\\<0$. Each $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ is a Riemannian 3\\-manifold with metric $g$ inherited from $(M,h)$. The most convenient way to write this metric is $g\\=h\\+n\\\\otimes n$, where $n$ is the normal 1\\-form of $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ with unit length. The lapse and shift are *not* canonical or unique. They are defined with respect to a *choice* of future pointing timelike vector field $\\\\vec{t}$, conventionally normalized by $dt(\\\\vec{t})\\=1$. Then the lapse is $N\\=\\-n(\\\\vec{t})$ and the shift 1\\-form is defined by $\\\\beta(\\\\vec{v})\\=g(\\\\vec{t},\\\\vec{v})$ for all tangent vectors $\\\\vec{v}$. Note that $\\\\beta(\\\\vec{n})\\=0$. Following the integral curves of $\\\\vec{t}$ allows one to construct a diffeomorphism relating the different $\\\\Sigma\\_t$. Then one can interpret the lapse as measuring the proper time between different slices $\\\\Sigma\\_t$, and $\\\\beta$ as measuring the relative velocity of observers that follow the normal $\\\\vec{n}$ and those that follow $\\\\vec{t}$.\n\nThe Einstein equations can be decomposed with respect to a regular slicing, yielding evolution and constraint equations. Different gauge choices \u2013 that is, different choices of $\\\\vec{t}$ \\- are used by relativists to produce different decompositions that have favourable mathematical properties, usually relating to the particular flavour of hyperbolicity of the evolution equations. \n\nSo lapse and shift certainly both carry meaning, but neither is canonically defined inasmuch as they depend upon the choice of $\\\\vec{t}$. The regular sliced form of the metric is indeed natural, in that it arises as described above once one has identified a global time coordinate on the spacetime. \n\nAdded: This attempts to answer the first question(s). I don't think that there is a better response to the second question \\- a slick way of calculating the Christoffel symbols \\- than that given by jc. The alternatives are also standard: a direct coordinate calculation or calculation of the connection 1\\-forms, from which one can read off the Christoffel symbols. \n\nEdit: (In response to Anirbit's queries.) First, about the normal 1\\-form $n$. This is a 1\\-form field on $M$ that is fixed and smooth once the (smooth) foliation by $\\\\Sigma\\_t$'s is specified. So there is no choice at this level. The same holds for the form of the 3\\-metric $g$ on $\\\\Sigma\\_t$: this is just the spacetime 4\\-metric $h$ restricted to tangent vectors to $\\\\Sigma\\_t$: $g\\=h\\+n\\\\otimes n$ is just the most convenient way to wite this metric. \n\nA key point here is that each $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ is a 3 dimensional Riemannian manifold, and so the metric $g$ has signature $(\\+,\\+,\\+)$ at each point. That is, at any point the metric $g$ has three positive eigenvalues \\- where the eigenvectors are tangent to $\\\\Sigma$. This is natural when we take the 3\\-dim perspective. When we think of $\\\\Sigma\\_t$ as being embedded in $M$, and allow $g$ to act on any tangent vector of $M$, we'd say that the signature is $(0,\\+,\\+,\\+)$. The zero eigenvalue corresponds to $n$. \n\nNow we step down one more dimension to consider a spatial 2\\-surface $S$ embedded in $\\\\Sigma\\_t$. A typical example is a 2\\-sphere in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ considered as a slice $t\\=$constant of Minkowski spacetime. The normal $m$ is a spacelike vector orthogonal to $n$. Again, the metric of $S$ is inherited naturally (no choice!) and has the convenient form $g^\\\\prime \\= h\\+n\\\\otimes n \\- m\\\\otimes m$. The minus sign arises to make sure we get the right signature $(0,0,\\+,\\+)$ for $g^\\\\prime$: without this signature \\- and without the minus sign \\- we would not have a Riemannian metric for $S$. The source of the sign difference is that $n$ is timelike, but $m$ is spacelike."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about semi-Riemannian metrics and regular slicing, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A cosmologist is studying a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,h)$ and wants to analyze its properties using a regular slicing.

I can tell them how we say things, but cannot always explain why it is that way. Today, one student asked about the phrase:\n\n**\"What does he do?\"**\n\nThey wanted to know why we use \"**do**\" at the end, and why we cannot say \"What does he **does**?\". I really wanted to answer their question, so I told them I'd answer tomorrow. Please let me know! Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first and second uses of the verb *do* are different.\n\nThe first *do* (\"what **does**\") is an auxiliary verb, which doesn't have meaning on its own, except to properly phrase a question. The auxiliary *do* is conjugated in the typical way:\n\nWhat do I...  \n\nWhat do you...  \n\nWhat does he...  \n\nWhat did I...  \n\nThe verb that follows the auxiliary *do* should be in the form of a *bare infinitive*, that is, the infinitive minus the *to*. The bare infinitive form of *to do* is *do*.\n\nSo it's:\n\nWhat *does* \\[auxiliary verb, conjugated in the present tense with the subject \"he\"] he *do* \\[bare infinitive of *to do*]?\n\nAs TaliesinMerlin points out, it may be helpful to think about this construction as a verb phrase. That term has multiple definitions, but here, we can think of a verb phrase just as multiple words which are used in combination as a verb. Some similar verb phrases with an auxiliary verb and a main verb are *he **can** do* and *he **should** do*.\n\nWhen we use a verb phrase, only one component of the phrase is conjugated to match the subject: \n\n*I **can** go*  \n\n*You **can** go*  \n\n*He **can** go*\\*\n\nIn this case, you can think of the verb phrase as *he does do* (an emphatic form of the statement *he does*), which is then inverted to form the interrogative form: *he does do* \\-\\> *what does he do?* \n\nOther examples will follow the same pattern:\n\nWhat does \\[auxiliary] she like \\[bare infinitive]?  \n\nWhere did \\[auxiliary in the past tense] they go \\[bare infinitive]?  \n\nHe does \\[auxiliary, here used for emphasis, not to form a question] think \\[bare infinitive]!\n\n---\n\n\\* This isn't the best example because *can* is irregular and is conjugated identically. If someone wants to edit this answer with a better example, they are welcome to do so."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about English grammar:\n\nQuestion: An ESL teacher is explaining the structure of the question \"What does he do?\" to their students. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the grammatical function and relationship of the two instances of \"do\" in this question?\n\nA) Both instances of \"do\" are main verbs, with the first conjugated and the second in infinitive form.\nB) The first \"do\" is an auxiliary verb conjugated for the subject, while the second is the main verb in its bare infinitive form.\nC) The first \"do\" is the main verb, while the second is an emphatic particle used for question formation.\nD) Both instances of \"do\" form a single verb phrase that is split for question formation, with no distinction in their roles.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple grammatical concepts explained in the documentation. The correct answer is B because it accurately describes the distinct roles of the two \"do\" verbs in the question \"What does he do?\". \n\nThe first \"does\" functions as an auxiliary verb, which is used to form the question and is conjugated to match the third-person singular subject \"he\". This follows the pattern of auxiliary verb usage in English questions, where the auxiliary is inverted with the subject.\n\nThe second \"do\" is the main verb of the sentence, appearing in its bare infinitive form. This aligns with the rule stated in the documentation that the verb following the auxiliary in such constructions should be in the bare infinitive form (infinitive minus \"to\").\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misidentifies both verbs as main verbs. Option C reverses the roles of the two verbs, which is inaccurate. Option D oversimplifies the grammatical structure and doesn't acknowledge the distinct roles of the two verbs.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to integrate multiple grammatical concepts, apply them to a specific example, and understand the nuanced roles of seemingly identical words in different positions within a sentence structure.

This solution addresses several key issues and follows LaTeX best practices:\n\n1. It avoids the non-existent `color` environment, which was causing unexpected results in the original attempt.\n2. By putting everything in one `\\makebox`, it ensures the rectangle and text appear on the same line without unwanted spacing.\n3.

Which approach would be most effective in achieving this layout while maximizing flexibility and minimizing code complexity?\n\nA) Use flexbox with media queries to adjust flex-basis and order properties\nB) Implement CSS Grid with grid-template-areas and media queries\nC) Use absolute positioning with percentage-based widths and media queries\nD) Combine float-based layout with JavaScript to reorder elements on resize\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach for this layout challenge is to implement CSS Grid with grid-template-areas and media queries (option B). This solution offers several advantages:\n\n1. Two-dimensional control: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, making it ideal for complex arrangements like the one described. It allows for easy manipulation of both rows and columns simultaneously.\n\n2. Grid-template-areas: This powerful feature of CSS Grid allows for a visual representation of the layout structure, making it easier to understand and maintain. It also simplifies the process of reordering elements for different screen sizes.\n\n3. Flexibility: Grid layout can easily adapt to different screen sizes without the need for complex calculations or JavaScript interventions.\n\n4. Minimal code: Using grid-template-areas requires less code compared to other methods, especially when handling reordering for responsive designs.\n\n5. Performance: CSS Grid is handled natively by the browser, offering better performance compared to JavaScript-based solutions.\n\nThe flexbox approach (A) could work but would be more complex for this particular layout, especially when reordering elements. Absolute positioning (C) lacks the flexibility needed for responsive design and can lead to overlapping issues. The float-based layout with JavaScript (D) is an outdated approach that introduces unnecessary complexity and potential performance issues.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a real-world scenario, apply modern web development concepts, and choose the most efficient solution among multiple valid options.

My recommendation is to use `./config --prefix=/usr/local shared` (notice the space before \"shared\") so that it installs there (and builds the shared library, `libssl`), rather than its own private subdirectory. If you do not do this, you will have to add a file to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` with `/usr/local/ssl/lib` in it (see below for the significance of `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` files), and add `/usr/local/bin` to `$PATH`.\n\n---\n\nYou will need to run `ldconfig` after `make install` to add the libraries to the linker cache. If that doesn't work, read on.\n\n`make install` probably by default went to `/usr/local`, which *should* take precedence but may not. You can thus leave your distro's openssl install to avoid messing around with the package manager and prereqs, but still use your own locally built version as the default. To check:\n\n```\nldd $(which ssh) | grep libssl\n\n```\n\nIf you get no output, your `ssh` was statically linked and needs to be rebuilt (see Anton's answer). Otherwise, this should point to your `/usr/local` version. If it points to something else:\n\n```\nldconfig -p | grep libssl\n\n```\n\nThe `/usr/local` version should be shown, but after some other one. If so, skip down to \"/usr/local/lib does not have precedence\" below. If not, make sure `/usr/local` is in the linker path generally:\n\n```\nldconfig -p | grep \"/usr/local\"\n\n```\n\nIf not, `grep -r \"/usr/local\" /etc/ld.so.conf.d`.

If the `/usr/local/lib` file doesn't contain anything else, just rename it with something which will supersede the other files; numbers go first so `000-whatever` is good.\n\nBecause you have complete control over `/usr/local/lib`, it *should* take precedence over any paths used by the distro package manager (and usually does).\n\n1\\. /usr/lib is a default compiled into the linker, but it and other standard system places (/lib, etc) are added *last*, which allows you to supersede them.

The correct approach is to use the approximation method for error propagation in non-linear functions.\n\nFor y = 1/x, the standard deviation of y can be approximated as:\nSTDy \u2248 |dy/dx| * STDx = (1/x^2) * STDx = STDx / x^2\n\nThis results in STDy \u2248 0.01 / (0.05^2) = 4 L/mg\n\nThe relative uncertainty in x is (0.01 / 0.05) * 100% = 20%\nThe relative uncertainty in y is (4 / (1/0.05)) * 100% = 20%\n\nWhile the relative uncertainties are the same, the absolute uncertainty in y is indeed higher than in x, and the relationship between STDy and STDx is not a simple reciprocal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the relationship between STDy and STDx.\nOption B is partially correct about the relative uncertainty but doesn't fully capture the complexity of the relationship.\nOption D is incorrect because we can estimate the uncertainty in y using error propagation techniques without knowing the exact distribution of x.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply error propagation concepts to a real-world scenario, integrate multiple concepts (measurement, inverse relationships, error propagation), and critically evaluate different statements about uncertainty."}, "72": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/02", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/266931", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/61235/"], "docs_id": 266931, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say I started a `su` command, and I want to cancel it. `Control`\\+`C` doesn't work for `su` like it does for `sudo`...

You *could* `su` to another shell and kill it from the other shell. Also (depending on the system), it might respond to `SIGHUP` (a hangup signal) if you closed the terminal session where the awkward `su` is in progress.\n\nThere's more than one way that `su` can ignore your `^C`, e.g.,\n\n* establishing signal handlers or\n* running under a different controlling terminal.\n\nA quick read of [Debian's `su`](https://sources.debian.org/src/shadow/1:4.5-1.1/src/su.c/) seems that it uses the latter.

They try to cancel the operation using Control+C, but it doesn't work. Which of the following best explains why Control+C is ineffective and provides the most appropriate solution?\n\nA) The `su` command runs with standard user privileges, so Control+C should work but the terminal is likely frozen. Restarting the terminal is the best solution.\n\nB) Control+C sends a signal with the user's privileges, which `su` ignores due to its elevated status. The administrator should use another terminal to `su` to root and kill the process.\n\nC) The `su` command establishes its own signal handlers, making it immune to Control+C. The only solution is to enter the correct password or exhaust all attempts.\n\nD) `su` runs under a different controlling terminal, ignoring Control+C. The administrator should close the entire terminal session to send a SIGHUP signal.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of privilege escalation, process control, and signal handling in Unix-like systems. The correct answer is B because it accurately describes why Control+C doesn't work with `su` and provides a practical solution. \n\n`su` runs with elevated privileges, which means it can ignore signals sent by the user's standard privileges, including the interrupt signal sent by Control+C (SIGINT). This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized interruption of privileged operations.\n\nThe solution of using another terminal to `su` to root and then killing the process is the most appropriate because:\n1. It maintains security by requiring proper authentication to gain the necessary privileges to terminate the `su` process.\n2. It demonstrates understanding of process management in Unix-like systems.\n3. It's a practical, real-world solution that doesn't require closing the entire terminal session.\n\nOption A is incorrect because `su` doesn't run with standard user privileges. \nOption C is partially correct about signal handling but overstates the immunity and doesn't offer a valid solution. \nOption D touches on the concept of controlling terminals but oversimplifies the issue and suggests an overly drastic solution.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (privilege escalation, process control, signal handling) and tests critical thinking about real-world system administration scenarios, making it suitable for L3 or higher in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "73": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/30", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/947296", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/475163/"], "docs_id": 947296, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Microsoft OneNote has a handy shortcut (`Ctrl`\\+`A`) that I use all the time to select an entire line.\u00a0\nAnd if you click it a second time it selects the entire document.\n\nI really would like to use `Ctrl`\\+`A` as shortcut in Notepad\\+\\+ to select the current line, but its default is to select the entire document.\u00a0 Is there a way to make it select only the entire current line?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Press `Home` then `Shift`\\+`End`.\n\n`End` then `Shift`\\+`Home` can also be used.

Configure three **different** network ranges for the three subnets, not the same one.  \n\nFor example, use `192.168.2.0` for your 802\\.11g, `192.168.3.0` for your first 802\\.11ac, and `192.168.4.0` for your last network. This will allow you to setup routes between the different networks.\n2. In your control panel, you need to find the \"Routing\" settings. You need to configure static routes:  \n\nRoute A: Desination IP `192.168.2.0`, Subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, Interface \\[that network's interface]  \n\nRoute B: Destination IP `192.168.3.0`, Subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, Interface \\[that network's interface]  \n\nAnd repeat the same for the last network.\n\n> Surely it doesn't matter? Once the data enters the router, it should\n>  get shuttled to whichever IP it is directed to, shouldn't it?\n\nIt should be directed, yes. But that will happen only if they were 3 different networks and if the router knew the route to them. That is why you configure static route, to tell the router that for example all traffic for `192.168.3.4` must go through interface 3\\.  \n\nThree different networks, but with the same network range \\& subnet mask (as in your case) cannot be routed. They are on 3 different interfaces (since it's a tri\\-band router, each band has its own interface), thus every packet for the network `192.168.2.0` will stay in the same interface it was sent from, since it has the same IP address range. How should the router know whether the packet destined to `192.168.2.100` is for interface A, B, or C, if they're all the same? That is why it cannot happen this way, you need 3 different IP ranges for the networks, and static routing.\n\n**Note**: Your router may be smart enough (may support dynamic routing protocols) to route to its different interfaces automatically and you might not need to configure static routing."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is investigating disk usage in a timeshift backup system and encounters inconsistent results when using the `du` command. Which of the following best explains the discrepancy and provides a solution for accurately analyzing space usage in a specific snapshot?\n\nA) The `du` command is not designed to handle hard links, so it's reporting incorrect sizes for snapshots. Use `ls -l` instead to get accurate file sizes.\n\nB) The wildcard `*` expansion is causing `du` to double-count shared files across snapshots. Use `du -hd 1 <specific_snapshot>` to analyze a single snapshot accurately.\n\nC) Timeshift uses a copy-on-write system, causing `du` to misinterpret file sizes. Use a specialized tool like `timeshift-gtk` to analyze snapshot sizes.\n\nD) The `du` command is following hard links across snapshots, leading to inflated size reports. Use `du -x` to stay within a single filesystem and accurately measure a specific snapshot.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The discrepancy in `du` results is due to how timeshift creates snapshots using hard links. When `du` is used with a wildcard (`*`), it follows these hard links across all snapshots, effectively counting shared files multiple times and inflating the reported size. This explains why individual snapshots appear larger when measured separately.\n\nThe `-x` option for `du` tells it to stay on one filesystem, which in this context means it won't follow hard links to other snapshots. This allows for accurate measurement of space used by a specific snapshot. To drill down into the 910M snapshot, you would use:\n\n```\ndu -hsx 2018-10-06_07-04-27\n```\n\nThis command will:\n- `-h`: Display sizes in human-readable format\n- `-s`: Summarize (don't go into subdirectories)\n- `-x`: Stay on one filesystem (don't follow hard links to other snapshots)\n\nTo further analyze which folders/files within the snapshot are using the most space, you can remove the `-s` option and add a depth limit:\n\n```\ndu -hx --max-depth=2 2018-10-06_07-04-27\n```\n\nThis approach addresses the core issue of hard link traversal, provides a solution for accurate measurement, and offers a method to drill down into specific snapshots, meeting the user's stated goals."}, "75": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/07", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/155871", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/79163/"], "docs_id": 155871, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question about cluster analysis.

Then $(M,1\\)$ is interdefinable with $(F,\\+,\\\\cdot)$ and therefore rigid, but $M$ has $\\|F\\|$ automorphisms $x\\\\mapsto ax$ for each $a\\\\in F^\\\\times$.\nThere exist rigid fields of any infinite cardinality, see e.g. <https://mathoverflow.net/a/61082/12705>.\n\nGeneralizing this and Eric Wofsey\u2019s answer, if $(A,\\\\cdot,R\\_1,R\\_2,\\\\dots,F\\_1,F\\_2,\\\\dots)$ is any rigid structure such that $\\\\cdot$ is a group operation, we can take $M\\=(A,\\\\cdot',R'\\_1,\\\\dots,F'\\_1,\\\\dots)$, where\n\\\\begin{gather}\n\\\\cdot'(x,y,z)\\=xz^{\\-1}y,\\\\\\\\\nR'\\_i(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n,z)\\\\iff R\\_i(x\\_1z^{\\-1},\\\\dots,x\\_nz^{\\-1}),\\\\\\\\\nF'\\_i(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n,z)\\=F\\_i(x\\_1z^{\\-1},\\\\dots,x\\_nz^{\\-1})z.\n\\\\end{gather}\nThen $M$ has automorphisms $x\\\\mapsto xa$ for each $a\\\\in A$, but $(M,1\\)$ is rigid. Elementary constructions of rigid structures (e.g., graphs) of arbitrary cardinality are easy to find, and expanding the structure with a $\\\\cdot$ if necessary preserves rigidity.\n\nSince all answers given so far are instances of the construction above, let me also mention an example that works in a different way. Let $F$ be a rigid field, and let $M$ be the polynomial ring $F\\[x]$. Since $F^\\\\times\\=M^\\\\times$ is definable in $M$, every automorphism of $M$ fixes $F$, and is uniquely determined by the image of $x$. Thus, $M$ has automorphisms $f(x)\\\\mapsto f(ax\\+b)$ for $a\\\\in F^\\\\times$, $b\\\\in F$, whereas $(M,x)$ is rigid."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about rigid structures and automorphisms, I'll create a question that requires analysis and application of these concepts:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is studying a structure M of uncountable cardinality \u03ba.

M = (F, +, R) where F is a rigid field and R(x,y,u,v) \u2194 xy=uv. This structure has |F| = \u03ba automorphisms of the form x \u21a6 ax for each a \u2208 F\u00d7, and (M, 1) is rigid (interdefinable with the original rigid field).\n\nC) While this construction does provide \u03ba automorphisms and a rigid (M, 1), it's based on a group A rather than a field F, which doesn't match the given properties as closely as option B.\n\nD) This option doesn't provide the required properties.

In this case we can solve the Schrodinger equation analytically and we get the well known $1s$, $2s$, etc functions. Although these are often referred to as *orbitals* they are actually the *wavefunctions* that the single electron can have. For more on this read Emilio's answer to [What do atomic orbitals represent in quantum mechanics?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/607552/what-do-atomic-orbitals-represent-in-quantum-mechanics/607654#607654) As wavefunctions these have well defined properties associated with them e.g. $\\|\\\\psi\\_{1s}\\|^2$ gives us the probability distribution for the $1s$ state, and the energy of the $1s$ orbital is:\n\n$$ E\\_{1s} \\\\psi\\_{1s} \\= H \\\\psi\\_{1s} $$\n\nThis energy is the total energy of the atom i.e. of the electron\\-nucleus system. You can split it into kinetic, $T$, and potential, $V$, energy parts and you'll find it obeys the virial theorem $\\-2T \\= V$. So far so good.\n\nThe problem is that with more than one electron we have forces acting between electrons as well as forces between the electrons and the nucleus. The forces between electrons mean the force is no longer central, and they entangle all the electrons so we cannot write the wavefunction as a product of separate functions for each electron. Instead we get a single wavefunction $\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r\\_1, \\\\mathbf r\\_2, \\\\cdots, \\\\mathbf r\\_n)$, where $\\\\mathbf r\\_i$ is the position of the $i$th electron, and the energy we get from this wavefunction is the total energy of the whole system of the nucleus and all $n$ electrons. Since the electrons are all entangled individual electrons do not have a well defined energy or a well defined probability distribution. We can find only the total energy and total electron probability distribution in the atom.\n\nBut it turns out that the interactions between pairs of electrons can be averaged out to produce an approximately central force, and using this approximation we can divide our total wavefunction into separate wavefunctions for each electron. So for lithium we could write:\n\n$$ \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r\\_1, \\\\mathbf r\\_2, \\\\mathbf r\\_3\\) \\\\approx \\\\psi\\_{1s\u2191} \\~ \\\\psi\\_{1s\u2193} \\~ \\\\psi\\_{2s\u2191} $$\n\nAnd these functions $\\\\psi\\_{1s\u2191}$ etc are the *atomic orbitals*.\n\nEach orbital has an energy and an electron density associated with them, but these are not the energy and probability distribution of that electron because as we discussed above the electrons are all entangled and cannot be described separately. However if we add up the energies of all the orbitals we will get the total energy of the atom, and likewise for the probability density."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is designing an experiment to demonstrate relativistic effects to students.

Thus:\n\n* *Any* state is just a state, i.e. a vector in $\\\\mathcal H$, which means that it can be expressed as a linear combination of only one vector in $\\\\mathcal H$, which isn't really what you want to count as a 'superposition' state.\n* On the other hand, for every state $\\\\psi$ in the state space $\\\\mathcal H$, there exists a pair of states $\\\\phi$ and $\\\\chi$ (actually, an infinite set of such pairs), such that \n$$ \\\\psi \\= \\\\phi \\+ \\\\chi.$$\nSo, in any meaningful technical sense, *all* states are superpositions.\n\nIn practice, though, you've generally got more information about your system than just the fully abstract perspective, and in particular you've usually got a preferred set of states (usually a basis) in mind. And with that set of states $\\\\{\\\\varphi\\_j\\\\}$ in hand, it *does* make sense to ask \n\n> is $\\\\psi$ one of the $\\\\varphi\\_j$, or is it a superposition of several of them,\n\nand to call that second category the \"superposition states\" of your system.\n\nHowever, as above, if you change the set of states that you're holding as 'special', then the separation of which states are and are not \"superposition states\" will move.\n\nAs Chiral Anomaly points out in his (great) answer, when we're talking about entanglement between two qubits, it does make sense to pick a certain basis for each of the qubits and then hold the tensor product of the states in those bases as 'special'; as Chiral points out, with that set in hand, the answer is yes \\- every entangled state must be a superposition of states in that separable basis. (And as Dan and ZeroTheHero point out, that condition is necessary but it is not sufficient: there are states which are not superpositions of those chosen basis states, but which are still separable and therefore not entangled.)\n\nHowever, in general, the fact that \"$\\\\psi$ is a superposition state\" is such a fragile statement, which makes no sense without some very clearly delineated context, means that it is very rarely used in professional practice without a suitable qualifier that specifies the set of states that's being held as special."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A quantum physicist is explaining the concept of superposition to a group of students.

The correct answer is D because the documentation emphasizes that the concept of a state \"being in superposition\" only makes sense within a specific context, namely when a preferred set of basis states is specified.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that changing the set of states held as 'special' can change which states are considered to be in superposition.

Is there really much of a difference apart from Kronecker's methods being more constructive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can find a nice description of Kronecker's approach in an article by Harley Flanders,\n\"The Meaning of the Form Calculus in Classical Ideal Theory\" (Trans. AMS 95 (1960\\), 92\\-\\-100\\). It is at JSTOR [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1993332?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). I found that more to my tastes than Edwards' book.\n\nThere is a difference between the two approaches. Kronecker was thinking in very general terms, beyond the \"one\\-dimensional\" setting that Dedekind worked in. (Kronecker had a dream \\-\\- a second one I suppose \\-\\- of unifying number theory and algebraic geometry but the tools to achieve this would take a couple more generations to appear). That accounts in part for Kronecker's multivariable polynomials. He had bigger goals than just unique factorization in rings of integers.\n\nHere is one example of the difference between Kronecker and Dedekind. Suppose ${\\\\mathfrak a}$ is an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field $K$ and I ask you to compute its norm, i.e., the size of ${\\\\cal O}\\_K/\\\\mathfrak a$. How would you do it? From Dedekind's point of view, you find a ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-basis of ${\\\\cal O}\\_K$ and of ${\\\\mathfrak a}$, write the basis of the ideal in terms of the basis of the ring of integers, and then compute (the absolute value of) the determinant of the matrix expressing the ideal basis in terms of the ring basis. But as you may know, ideals usually are *not* given to us in terms of a ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-basis. More often they are given in terms of just two generators, say ${\\\\mathfrak a} \\= (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)$. How can you compute the norm of the ideal in terms of the two generators? In principle it should be possible, since the two generators determine the ideal they generate, so all the data you need is encoded in the numbers $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$.\n\nThere is a Dedekind\\-style way to write the norm of ${\\\\mathfrak a}$ in terms of the two generators: the norm of an ideal is the gcd of the norms of *all* elements of the ideal.\nWatch out: you can't get by using only the gcd of the norms of the two generators.\nFor example, in the Gaussian integers the ideal $(1\\+2i,1\\-2i)$ is the unit ideal $(1\\)$, so it has norm 1, but the two generators $1\\+2i$ and $1\\-2i$ have norm 5, whose gcd is not 1\\. (Of course the ideal also contains $1\\+2i \\- (1\\-2i) \\= 4i$, whose norm is 4, and the gcd of that with 5 is one and you're done.) In principle you only need to form the gcd of the norms of a finite number of elements in the ideal, but it's not clear which \"finitely many\" elements are practically enough. So I think it's fair to say Dedekind's point of view does not easily allow you to find the norm of an ideal in terms of two generators of the ideal, which is how one usually thinks about them concretely.\n\nNow here is how Kronecker would find the norm of the ideal (essentially). Form the polynomial $\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T}$ in ${\\\\cal O}\\_K\\[T]$. The field extension $K(T)/{\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$ is finite.\nTake the field norm of $\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T}$ down to ${\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$. The result is in ${\\\\mathbf Z}\\[T]$.\nThat integral polynomial has finitely many coefficients (which are *not* all norms of elements in $K$, so this isn't some disguised version of the previous paragraph). The gcd of the integral coefficients of ${\\\\rm N}\\_{K(T)/{\\\\mathbf Q}(T)}(\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T})$ is the norm of the ideal. And if the ideal is given to you with more than two generators, just let $f(T)$ be the polynomial with higher degree having those generators as its coefficients, one for each power of $T$ (it doesn't matter what order you use the generators as coefficients) and do the same thing as in the case of two generators: field norm down to ${\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$ and then gcd of the integral coefficients that pop out. I personally was blown away when I saw this method work, since practically no books on algebraic number theory discuss Kronecker's point of view, so this particular result isn't there. (To be honest, you do *not* need Kronecker's multivariable polynomial method to prove this norm formula. Once you know the formula, it can be derived by more orthodox techniques, but of course it leaves out the question of how anyone would have ever discovered this formula in the first place by orthodox methods. Any suggestions?)\n\nIn a sense this example is only a \"constructive\" dichotomy between Kronecker and Dedekind, but I think it still addresses the question that is asked, because each method of solving this problem (Dedekind's ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-bases and Kronecker's polynomials) is constructive but they feel so different from each other."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Kronecker's and Dedekind's approaches to ideal theory, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A number theorist is developing an algorithm to efficiently compute the norm of an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field K.

The correct answer, B, reflects Kronecker's approach, which is more efficient and elegant for this specific problem.\n\nOption A (Dedekind's method) is theoretically sound but practically inefficient, as it requires finding Z-bases which are not typically how ideals are presented.\n\nOption B (Kronecker's method) is the most effective approach.

I noticed the following things \\- \n\n1. Little or no comments in code.\n2. Method and variable names are not self describing.\n3. There is little or no documentation for how the code fits into the system or business processes.\n4. Hiring bad developers or not mentoring the good ones . They can't write simple and clean code. Hence its difficult or impossible for anyone, including the developer to document the code.\n\nAs a result, I have had to go through a lot of code and talk to many people to learn things. I feel this wastes everyone's time. It also creates the need for KT/Knowledge transfer sessions for newcomers to a project. \n\nI learned that documentation is not given the attention it deserves because of the following reasons: \n\n1. Laziness.\n2. Developers don't like to do anything but code.\n3. Job security. (If no one can understand your code easily, then you might not be easily replaceable.)\n4. Difficult deadlines leave little time to document.\n\nSo, I am wondering if there is a way to encourage and enforce good documentation practices in a company or project. What are the strategies to be used for creating decent documentation for the systems and code of any project, regardless of its complexity ? Are there any good examples of when minimal or no documentation is needed ? \n\nIMHO, I feel that we should have a documentation review after a project is delivered. If it is not simple, concise, illustrative and user friendly, the developer or technical documentation engineer own the responsibility for it and be made to fix it. I neither expect people to make reams of documentation, not hope that it will be user friendly like the head first books, but I expect it to eliminate the need for hours of analysis and wasteful KT sessions. \n\nIs there a way to end or alleviate this madness ? \"Document driven development\" perhaps ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How to document code?\n---------------------\n\nYou already have a hint: look at how Java API is documented.\n\nMore generally, there is no unique set of rules which apply to every project. When I work on business\\-critical large\\-scale projects, the documentation has nothing to do with the one I would write for a small open source library, which, in turn, has nothing to do with the documentation of my medium\\-scale personal project.\n\nWhy many open source projects are not documented well?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause most open source projects are made by people who contribute to those projects because it's fun. Most programmers and developers consider that **writing documentation is not fun enough** to be done for free.\n\nWhy many closed\\-source projects are not documented well?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause it costs a huge amount of money to (1\\) write good documentation and to (2\\) maintain it.\n\n1. The immediate cost (cost of writing the documentation) is clearly visible to the stakeholders: if your team asks to spend the next two months documenting the project, it's two additional months of salary to pay.\n2. The long term cost (cost of maintaining the documentation) becomes noticeable pretty easy too to the managers, and is often the first target when they must lower the cost or shorten the delays. This causes an additional problem of outdated documentation which quickly becomes useless, and is extremely expensive to update.\n3. The long term savings (savings from not having to waste a few days exploring the legacy code just to understand a basic thing which should have been documented years ago) are, on the other hand, difficult to measure, which confirms the feeling of some managers that writing and maintaining documentation is a waste of time.\n\nWhat I often observe is that:\n\n1. At the beginning, the team is willing to document a lot.\n2. Over time, pressure of deadlines and lack of interest make it more and more difficult to maintain the documentation.\n3. A few months later, a new person who joins the project practically can't use the documentation, because it doesn't correspond at all to the actual system.\n4. Noticing that, management blames developers for not maintaining the documentation; developers ask to spend a few weeks updating it.\n\n\t* If management grants a few weeks for that, the cycle repeats.\n\t* If management refuses, based on previous experience, it only increases the bad experience, since the product lacks documentation, but a few months were spent writing and maintaining it.\n\n**Documentation should be a continuous process, just like testing. Spend a week simply coding a few thousands of LOC, and getting back to tests and documentation is very, very painful.**\n\nHow to encourage the team to write documentation?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly to the ways to encourage people to write clean code, to do regular refactoring, to use design patterns or to add enough unit tests.\n\n* Lead by example. If you write good documentation, your pairs might start doing it too.\n* Do systematic code reviews, including formal code reviews targeted at inspecting the documentation.\n* If some members of the team are particularly antipathetic to good documentation (or documentation at all), discuss the subject with them privately, to understand what are the impediments which prevent them from writing better documentation. If they blame the lack of time, you see the source of the problems.\n* Make the presence or the lack of documentation measurable for a few weeks or months, but don't focus on that. For example, you may measure the number of lines of comments per LOC, but don't make it a permanent measure, otherwise, developers will start writing long but meaningless comments just to get rid of low scores.\n* Use gamification. This comes together with the previous point.\n* Use positive/negative [reinforcement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement).\n* (See [the comment by SJuan76](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/246917/how-to-do-documentation-for-code-and-why-is-software-often-poorly-documented/246920?noredirect=1#comment495953_246920)) Treat the lack of comments as errors. For example, in Visual Studio, you can check an option to generate XML documentation. If you also check that all warnings are treated as errors, the lack of a comment at the top of a class or a method will halt the compilation.\n\nAs for the three previous points, this one should be used with caution. I used it for a while with a particularly tough team of beginner programmers, and it ended up with StyleCop\\-compliant comments like that:\n\n```cs\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Gets or sets the PrimaryHandling.\n    /// </summary>\n    public Workflow PrimaryHandling { get; set; }\n\n```\n\nwhich were, hm..., not particularly helpful.\n\n**Remember: [nothing automated can help you pinpoint bad comments when programmers wants to screw with you](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/242656/6605).** Only code reviews and other *human* tasks will help.\n\nAre there any good examples of when minimal or no documentation is needed?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Documentation explaining the architecture and the design** is not needed:\n\n* For a prototype,\n* For a personal project written in a few hours to accomplish a task, while being pretty sure this project won't be maintained any longer,\n* For any project where it is obvious, given the small size of it, coupled with the particularly clean code, that you will spend more time writing documentation than all the future maintainers exploring the code.\n\n**In\\-code documentation** (code comments) is not needed according to some developers when the code is self\\-documenting. For them, the presence of comments is, except in the rare cases, not a good sign, but a sign that the code wasn't refactored enough to be clear without the need for comments.\n\n> I feel that we should have a documentation review after a project is delivered.\n\nIf your project is delivered at least once per week, it's the way to go.

Given that the MLE \u03b8\u0302 is asymptotically efficient and normally distributed, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between the asymptotic properties and the convergence of \u03c4(\u03b8\u0302) to \u03c4(\u03b8)?\n\nA) The consistency of \u03c4(\u03b8\u0302) is a direct consequence of its asymptotic efficiency, without need for further proof.\nB) The convergence of \u03c4(\u03b8\u0302) to \u03c4(\u03b8) in probability can be derived from the asymptotic normality of \u03b8\u0302, using the Delta method and properties of the Fisher Information.\nC) The asymptotic efficiency of \u03b8\u0302 is sufficient to prove the convergence of \u03c4(\u03b8\u0302) to \u03c4(\u03b8) without considering the asymptotic normality.\nD) The convergence of \u03c4(\u03b8\u0302) to \u03c4(\u03b8) requires a separate proof using Jensen's inequality, independent of the asymptotic properties of \u03b8\u0302.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about the relationships between asymptotic properties of MLEs. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The asymptotic normality of \u03b8\u0302 is given as \u221an(\u03b8\u0302 - \u03b8) \u2192\u1d30 N(0, I(\u03b8)\u207b\u00b9), where I(\u03b8) is the Fisher Information.\n2. The Delta method can be applied to extend this result to functions of \u03b8, such as \u03c4(\u03b8).\n3. Under regularity conditions, the Fisher Information exists and is bounded, which implies that the variance of \u03b8\u0302 goes to zero as n increases.\n4. The convergence of the variance to zero, combined with the asymptotic normality, implies mean-squared error consistency.\n5. Mean-squared error consistency, in turn, implies convergence in probability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because asymptotic efficiency alone is not sufficient to prove consistency. Option C is incorrect because it ignores the crucial role of asymptotic normality in the proof. Option D is incorrect because while Jensen's inequality is used in the original proof of consistency for MLEs, it's not necessary when starting from the given asymptotic properties.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the relationships between different asymptotic properties and apply them to a specific scenario, requiring a deep understanding of statistical theory beyond mere memorization."}, "97": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/25", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/472517", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/9331/"], "docs_id": 472517, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have my own (personal) domain where all email sent to this domain is forwarded to my Gmail account.

Then I used telnet to connect to port 25 of mail.zoneedit.com and test the connection and found that the mail server is rejecting connections due to it being unable to do a reverse address lookup on the IP address of the system attempting to connect, presumably a mail server attempting to send a message to the mail forwarder.\n\nI've already placed a couple of tech support calls with the company that owns Zoneedit, they're aware of the problem and tell me the guys that manage the server in Vancouver, BC are working on the problem.

I hope my idea would make it cheaper to construct paved roads in my region. So to start with, I want to **find out how expensive it is to construct road** today.\n\nI have access to **a listing of all roads constructed in the past few years**. What I want to do is **make a random sample of these roads**, then contact the relevant people to **find out how many feet were constructed, and at what total cost**. From this, I expect to be able to compute an **average dollar\\-cost per foot of road** in my region.\n\nThis sounds simple enough. Here's my problem: I can think of two ways of doing the computation:\n\n* Either I treat the roads themselves as units. Then I would compute dollars/feet for each, and then average together those numbers.\n* Alternatively, I treat the feet\\-of\\-paved\\-roads as units. This would result in each sampled road contributes a different number of feet to the average \u2013 hypothetically, if there's a really long road that turned out to be very expensive, it would drive up the average compared to the previous method.\n\nEither way, from what I can tell, each foot of road has an equal opportunity to end up in the sample. **So the decision is mainly \"do I count average foot\\-cost per road, or average cost per foot of road?\"**\n\nOn this, I have two questions:\n\n1. Which of these two approaches give the most correct result? I honestly cannot tell you if \"foot\\-cost per road\" or \"cost per foot of road\" is the more meaningful measurement. What am I missing?\n2. If the most meaningful measurement is \"cost per foot of road\" then the computation effectively becomes, for the entire sample, sum(dollars)/sum(feet) \u2013 how do I get the variance of this statistic?\n\nSorry if this sounds basic. I know I should know this stuff, but for some reason it escapes me and I haven't been able to figure it out the past few days. I've been looking both into Cochran's *Sampling Techniques* and Levy's *Sampling of Populations* \u2013 I know both books come close to this specific question, but they never linger on it and go deeper into it.\n\nI'll continue my research into the sampling literature I have at home, but in the meantime if any of you happen to know the answers \u2013 please share!\n\n---\n\nI'm aware stratifying the sample would allow me to treat very long roads separately in case they practically make up a separate population cost\\-wise, but that ends up being the same problem: do I weigh the strata by number of roads in each, or by the total length of road in each?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, notation. Suppose there are $N$ total roads constructed in the region, each with road length $x\\_i$ feet, total cost $y\\_i$, and cost per foot $r\\_i \\= y\\_i/x\\_i$. Let the population averages be $\\\\mu\\_r \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum r\\_i$, similarly for $\\\\mu\\_y$ and $\\\\mu\\_x$, the total length of all roads $T\\_x \\= \\\\sum x\\_i$, total cost $T\\_y \\= \\\\sum y\\_i$, and the overall cost per foot $R \\= T\\_y/T\\_x$ ($\\= \\\\mu\\_y/\\\\mu\\_x$). We sample $n$ of these roads. $r$ will be an estimate of $R$.\n\nFor question 1, You correctly notice that the average of the costs per foot is not the same as the overall ratio, $\\\\mu\\_r \\\\ne R$. This is not an issue of one being \"correct\" and the other being \"wrong\", both are perfectly well defined values that are useful in different scenarios. Different use cases and objectives will care more about one than the other, so subject matter experience is essential here. A lower value of $\\\\mu\\_r$ indicates that most projects had lower costs, while a lower value of $R$ indicates that the region's overall costs were lower.\n\nPersonally, I think $R$ is generally more useful/applicable, but it's possible to imagine situations where either would be desirable. For example, the region's financial manager cares about the total budget spent on roads, but is willing to pay higher expenses on many small projects to save on a large highway. Or conversely, a group of landowners care about the costs on their small individual projects, but don't care about the region's total spending.\n\nFor question 2, I'll dump the formulas for Ratio Estimation from *Elementary Survey Sampling, Scheaffer, Mendenhall, Ott, and Gerow, 2012*, section 6\\.3\\. These formulas assume simple random sampling. The estimate of $R$ is $r$,\n\n$$\nr \\= \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}y\\_i}{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}x\\_i} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\bar{y}}{\\\\bar{x}}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{V}\\[r] \\= \\\\left(1\\- \\\\frac{n}{N}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu\\_x^2}\\\\frac{s\\_r^2}{n} \\\\\\\\\ns\\_r^2 \\= \\\\frac{1}{n\\-1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}(y\\_i \\- r x\\_i)^2\n$$\n\n$\\\\mu\\_x$ can be replaced by $\\\\bar{x}$ if it's unknown, but Scheaffer et al recommend that it should be known as accurately as possible. (cv($\\\\bar{x}$) \\= SD($\\\\bar{x}$)/$\\\\mu\\_x$ should be less than 0\\.1\\) An approximate 95% confidence interval for $R$ can be constructed as $r \\\\pm 1\\.96\\*\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{V}\\[r]}$.\n\nA few closing thoughts, note that $r$ is a biased estimate of $R$ and the above confidence interval sometimes performs poorly. Various corrections are available, but they get more complicated. You can read more by searching for \"Ratio Estimation\". You will need to pay attention between resources for estimating the population ratio $R$ and estimating the population total, $T\\_y$, which is also commonly done with ratio estimates. The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_estimator) seems like a solid place to start."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about road construction cost analysis, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A regional planner is analyzing road construction costs to propose efficiency improvements.

Option D is the most comprehensive approach because:\n\n1. It addresses the core dilemma presented in the documentation between treating roads as units vs. treating feet of road as units.\n2. Ratio estimation, as mentioned in the top answer, provides a method to estimate the overall cost per foot (R = T_y / T_x) while accounting for variability in road lengths.\n3. It incorporates both individual road costs and overall regional totals, providing a more nuanced view than simple averages.\n4. The method allows for calculation of variance and confidence intervals, which are crucial for budget planning.\n5. It avoids potential biases that could arise from simple averaging methods (options A and B).\n6. While stratification (option C) could be useful, the ratio estimation approach is more sophisticated and doesn't require arbitrary decisions about stratification criteria.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate different statistical approaches in a real-world scenario, integrating concepts of sampling, estimation, and practical applicability for regional planning."}}
