We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, [visit the help center](https://askubuntu.com/help/reopen-questions) for guidance.\n\nAfter reading every answers, I am not sure why is this kind of question a violation of intergalatic rules. To summarize, the rules are :\n\n* Questions must be supported by :\n\t+ Facts\n\t+ References\n\t+ Expertise\n* Question must not solicit :\n\t+ Debate\n\t+ Arguments\n\t+ Polling\n\t+ Extended discussion\n\nHowever, in the answers that I've read, this question seems very legitimate and fits very well the established infrastructure of StackExchange and in its Q\\&A format. Saying that `this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format` is a lie.\n\nWhile the question remains a subjective one, one can draw objective conclusions by using subjective questions and answers or at least get something positive out of it. I don't think that this question is the Devil's spawn.\n\nThe answers are indeed supported by facts, references and users' own expertise and does solicit debate, polling and extended discussion. However, is that a bad thing? It you look at [In Android 6, how to deny an app permission to access the network?](https://android.stackexchange.com/q/138311/199649), you'll notice that, while there is indeed an objective answer to the question, there's also alternatives provided by the community to still answer the question in a subjective manner.\n\nBecause this website is so often a first hit on Google, I think that being open to discussion and seeking extended discussion is important.\n\nAnd, mostly, this question and its answers **are constructive**.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I may partly agree with you, in that the **not constructive** close reason was confusing and we don't use it anymore. I'm sorry it ever did exist\\-\\-or, really, mainly just that it was *called* that. It's not one of the close reasons that can be selected today. However, that question shouldn't be reopened. We would still close it if it were asked today, we would just be able to select a close reason that makes more sense. I think three of [our current close reasons](https://askubuntu.com/help/closed-questions) apply:\n\n* **Too broad.** There's really no limit to how many distinct answers could be posted. And if a single answer tried to address a large chunk of the question, it would be enormous, at least if it tried to explain its judgments. In the case of this particular sort of question, requesting a big list of answers, this overlaps with \"primarily opinion\\-based\" too (see below).\n* **Unclear.** What does \"must have\" mean? Does it mean \"greatly beneficial\"? Does it mean \"really cool and you will tell your friends\"? Does it mean \"your system isn't worth using without it\"? Does it mean \"good to know about\"? Does it mean \"more than X% of users will like it?\"\n* **Primarily opinion based.** There was hardly any standard by which to judge the appropriateness of the answers besides personal opinion. The question was not an explicit call for discussion, and to a limited extent facts and experience were *a factor* in determining what people would post and how people would vote on them. But mostly arbitrary opinions\\-\\-that is, personal preference\\-\\-was the *major factor* governing what answers would exist and how well they would be received. The top\\-voted answer recommended VLC. Why was that something people \"must have\"? Did those votes really reflect that VLC was the *most important* program to install? Did they reflect that it was important *at all*? Or did they just reflect that VLC is *generally well\\-liked*?\n\nThe question was not just subjective in the sense of not having any provably best answer, which is true of many perfectly good questions. It fell afoul of the problem that [just about every answer that might plausibly be posted was equally valid](https://askubuntu.com/help/dont-ask). This part of the existing closure explanation applied fully:\n\n> We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or expertise\n\nThe question itself contains some hints that it was never actually a good fit for our site:\n\n* If you look at what most of the text in the question is doing, it is mostly giving advice about *the special and different way one has to use the site* to answer it appropriately.\n* It emphasizes searching\\-\\-not reading, or skimming, or perusing, but *searching*\\-\\-the existing answers before posting another. That is, it was expected that most people would not actually consider what the existing answers said before writing their own. It was expected that there would be so many answers that most people who came to the question would not look at all of them.\n\nThis is to say that **the question was in effect a poll asking people what their favorite software was**, and not something that could practically answer a new Ubuntu user's question about what additional software they would be well advised to install on a fresh Ubuntu system.\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, the question was really a duplicate of [What are the most useful programs installed after setup of a vanilla Ubuntu?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1237/what-are-the-most-useful-programs-installed-after-setup-of-a-vanilla-ubuntu) which was subsequently deleted by a moderator. (If this question had remained open for longer, or if we were to reopen it now, more effort would go into and then it would still likely be closed eventually and then deleted, too, either by a moderator or from community members' delete votes.)\n\nThere's an argument to be made that the other, original, deleted question should not have been deleted by a moderator but should instead have been deleted through the gradual accumulation of community members' delete votes, or even that it should have been preserved with [a historical lock](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/13506/22949). But the question you've asked about was just a rehash of it, is unlikely to warrant special treatment, will likely be deleted eventually, and would likely have been deleted a while ago if it had captured more attention. After all, it says:\n\n> Inspired by this [question](https://superuser.com/questions/1241/what-are-some-must-have-windows-programs).

Let me illustrate what I mean with a graphical example:\n\nInput\n-----\n\nSuppose I have the following MultiLineString: `MULTILINESTRING ((120 105, 140 98),(160 103, 140 98),(100 100, 120 105))`\n[![Input MultiLineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqZne.png)\n\nNote how, to our human eyes, it seems out of order: the first (orange) segment is in the middle, the second (green) segment is coded backwards in relation to the other segments (i.e., pointing to the left instead of to the right).\n\nDesired Output\n--------------\n\nThe desired output would be the following LineString: `LINESTRING (100 100, 120 105, 140 98 160 103)`\n\n[![Output LineString](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRVbQ.png)\n\nNote how the output is now looks much more sensible.

My approach has two different steps:\n\n* Extract unique coordinates\n* Sort unique coordinates\n\nI've been able to do the first part quite easily, but it's not clear to me how to reorder the points.\n\nI thought about a heuristic that would find the point that is cumulatively furthest to all other points, label that as the starting point, add all other points to a pool of unsorted points and then sequentially find the next closest point until I run out of unsorted points.\n\nHowever, this sorting heuristic would fail in A BUNCH of cases: consider a geometry that describes a spiral. Or a strong zig\\-zagging pattern. Or a geometry with a bunch of self\\-intersections. This heuristic would just fail completely.\n\nTherefore, I suspect this approach of extracting unique points and sorting them isn't the right one.\n\nBack to the start\n-----------------\n\nSo, I'm back to my main question: how can I sort the coordinates of a `MultiLineString` such that they make more intuitive sense?\n\nReproducible example and code\n-----------------------------\n\nHere's the Python code for my very incomplete solution thus far.\n\n```py\nimport shapely\n\n# Write the MultiLineString WKT\nmls_wkt = 'MULTILINESTRING ((120 105, 140 98),(160 103, 140 98),(100 100, 120 105))'\n\n# Generate the shapely geometry\nmls = shapely.wkt.loads(mls_wkt)\n\n# Function that extracts unique coordinate values\ndef get_unique_points(input_multilinestring):\n    # Gets a nested list of coordinates\n    coords_nested = [list(this_geom.coords) for this_geom in input_multilinestring.geoms]\n\n    # Flattens the list\n    coords = [item for sub_list in coords_nested for item in sub_list]\n\n    # Gets only the unique coords\n    coords_set = set()\n    coords_final = []\n    for i,coord in enumerate(coords):\n        if coord not in coords_set:\n            coords_set.add(coord)\n            coords_final.append(coord)\n    return coords_final\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You might be able to just use [`shapely.ops.linemerge`](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#shapely.ops.linemerge).

Which approach is most likely to produce the desired result while handling various geometric complexities?\n\nA) Extract unique coordinates and sort them based on their cumulative distance from all other points\nB) Implement a custom algorithm to find the nearest neighbor for each point sequentially\nC) Use shapely.ops.linemerge to combine the MultiLineString geometries\nD) Convert the MultiLineString to a set of points and use a traveling salesman algorithm to order them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate and efficient approach to transform a MultiLineString into a continuous LineString is to use shapely.ops.linemerge. This function is specifically designed to handle the complexities of merging multiple line segments into a single, coherent LineString.\n\nOption A (extracting and sorting unique coordinates) would fail in many cases, as mentioned in the documentation.

The first result implies that the properties of the OLS estimator for the betas are not affected by the fact that we have approximated the non\\-linear function by its first order Taylor approximation. The second result implies that the approximation is optimal under the same criterion for which the conditional expectation is the optimal predictor (mean squared error, here mean squared remainder). \n\nBoth premises are needed for these results, namely, that we take the Taylor expansion around the expected value of the regressors, and that we use OLS."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Taylor approximations and expectations, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing a complex financial model where the expected value of a function of an exponential term, E(f(e^x)), needs to be approximated.

The documentation emphasizes that we cannot always assume the Taylor remainder term is negligible.

The correct answer is D because the noun \"approach\" typically requires the preposition \"to\" before its complement, regardless of whether it's followed by a gerund or a noun. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, while \"to reconstruct\" would be grammatically correct if \"approach\" were used as a verb, in this context \"approach\" is a noun, so \"to reconstruction\" is actually correct. \n\nOption B is partially correct in that the sentence structure could be improved, but it doesn't address the core grammatical issue being discussed.\n\nOption C is incorrect because removing \"to\" would make the sentence grammatically incorrect when \"approach\" is used as a noun.\n\nThe question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between \"approach\" as a noun vs. a verb, the use of prepositions with nouns, and the flexibility in constructing such sentences (e.g., using a gerund form as an alternative).

I guess it makes some sense that the $\\\\delta$\\-function is there, since I'm only concerned with $z\\=0$ anyways, but it of course shouldn't be the case that a physical quantity like the electric field is merely a mathematical 'distribution' i.e. delta function. However, I cannot just leave out the $\\\\delta$\\-function, since it carries a unit of $1/\\\\text{meter}$ which is crucial to make the units consistent.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here? As you can see, I tried to do this derivation *rigorously* by starting from Gauss' law in coordinate\\-free form, and then converting using the divergence theorem; in this step, the difference between 2D and 3D should arise. I have seen other questions on this website where people would instead simply say that the right\\-hand side becomes the \"enclosed charge\" $$Q\\_\\\\text{encl} \\= \\\\int\\_V \\\\text{d}^3 r \\\\,\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)$$ even in 2D (e.g. [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/264627/353438)), but they end up (as far as I can see) with inconsistent units (i.e. they miss a $1/\\\\text{meter}$ which I have in my $\\\\delta\\\\left(z\\\\right)$). Another common method of getting rid of this I see is that people use a 'line charge density' $\\\\lambda$ (units $\\\\text{C} \\\\, \\\\text{m}^{\\-1}$) (e.g. [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/376641)), but that is only if you have an infinitely long line with a charge per unit length $\\\\lambda$.

The researcher observes that the electric field strength decreases more slowly with distance compared to traditional 3D materials. Which of the following best explains this observation and its implications for Coulomb screening in 2D systems?\n\nA) The electric field in 2D follows a 1/r dependence, leading to stronger long-range interactions and less effective screening\nB) The electric field in 2D follows a log(r) dependence, resulting in infinite-range interactions and no effective screening\nC) The electric field in 2D follows a 1/r\u00b2 dependence, identical to 3D systems, but with a different prefactor\nD) The electric field in 2D cannot be properly defined due to the presence of a delta function in the z-direction\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The electric field in a truly 2D system follows a 1/r dependence, as opposed to the 1/r\u00b2 dependence in 3D systems. This slower decay of field strength with distance leads to stronger long-range Coulomb interactions in 2D materials.\n\nThe 1/r dependence arises from the fundamental differences in how Gauss's law applies in 2D versus 3D. In 2D, the electric flux through a closed loop (the 2D equivalent of a Gaussian surface) is proportional to the enclosed charge, but the circumference of this loop increases linearly with r, leading to the 1/r field dependence.\n\nThis has significant implications for Coulomb screening in 2D systems. The slower decay of the electric field means that charge carriers (electrons or holes) in 2D materials interact more strongly over longer distances compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, screening of charges is less effective in 2D systems, which can lead to different electronic properties and behaviors in 2D materials.\n\nThe presence of a delta function in the z-direction (option D) is a mathematical artifact of applying 3D formalism to a 2D system and does not accurately represent the physics of a truly 2D material. Options B and C are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the electric field behavior in 2D systems.\n\nThis question requires the integration of concepts from electrostatics, dimensional analysis, and materials science, testing the ability to apply physical principles to novel situations and understand their real-world implications."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/15", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/76843", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/29240/"], "docs_id": 76843, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today, I started learning AD Kayle top lane, and became excited about double AD comps.

If the given answer is correct won't it mean that there is ZERO work done in bringing water from the underground no matter how deep it is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I agree with JMac's comment that the question is highly ambiguous and cannot be answered definitively. Perhaps the required context or assumptions are provided by the previous sections in the textbook.\n\nIf the water level in the well remains 20m below ground level while water is pumped out, and that of the tank at 10m above, then every litre of water is raised through a height of 30m. The same reasoning applies if the water is initially at ground level and the depth of water in the well is 20m. Judging by the answer, perhaps the key insight is that the reservoir of water below ground is so vast that the level of water in the well is not affected by removing 22380 litres. This also assumes that the rate at which water is removed is less that the rate at which it can seep back into the well through its walls and base. \n\nHowever, if the level of water in the well and/or the storage tank changes, then the calculation is not so straightforward. You can only decide if this is the case from the situation described in the question.

The correct approach (D) recognizes the complexity and potential ambiguity in real-world pumping systems:\n\n1. Well-to-ground calculation: This accounts for the energy needed to lift water from the well to ground level. The actual energy required depends on whether the water level in the well remains constant or drops during pumping.\n\n2. Ground-to-tank calculation: This covers the energy needed to elevate water from ground level to the storage tank.\n\n3. System behavior analysis: The engineer must consider if the well water level remains constant (e.g., due to rapid refill from an aquifer) or if it drops during pumping. If constant, the calculations can be combined for a total 65m lift. If not, the energy requirement will change over time as the well level drops.\n\nThis approach avoids oversimplification (options A and C) and acknowledges that blindly adding depths (option B) may not always be correct.

It does not impose any specific slot population requirements.\nAdvanced Error Correction Code (ECC) mode extends SDDC from x4 DRAM based DIMMs to both x4 and x8 DRAMs. This protects against single DRAM chip failures during normal operation. The restriction is that memory modules must be identical in size, speed, and technology. Identical DIMMs are installed in matched pair. Since you can order a server from start with this type of module compliance, there's no problem using AECC instead of optimized.\n\nNote that both optimized and AECC modes will let the **full amount of memory** be usable.\n\nIf power is fine which it should be on a server, there is no actual reason for RAM modules to have problems, the probability of that is low.\n\nIf you want to make sure you don't have to open up the server in the low chance case of a memory failure, you may choose spare mode. In this mode, one rank per channel is reserved as a spare. If persistent correctable errors are detected on a rank, the data from this rank is copied to the spare rank, and the failed rank is disabled. The memory available to the operating system is reduced by one rank per channel.\n\nFor example, in a dual\\-processor configuration with 16x 4 GB single\\-rank memory modules, the available system memory is: **3/4** (ranks/channel) \u00d7 16 (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 48 GB, and not 16 1x (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 64 GB.\n\nMirroring is like a RAID 1 for memory. The bad part is that in a mirrored configuration, the total available system memory is one half of the total installed physical memory, exactly like with HDDs in RAID 1\\. So if you really need maximum protection you an choose this one but in your case you will have only 192 GB (**half**) to work with.\n\nFault Resilient Memory (FRM) is an operating mode introduced in newer PowerEdge servers. The mode establishes an area of memory that is fault resilient and can be used by hypervisors such as VMware ESXi to load vmkernel, critical applications or services to maximize system availability. The operating systems uses the resilient region exposed from the platform and map the process\u2019s address ranges to enforce resiliency. This is good to be used for ESXi installations. FRM creates a highly resilient memory zone for the hypervisor, protecting it from severe memory errors. With the VMware Reliable Memory feature, vSphere 5\\.5 and later revisions can take advantage of this zone, providing the hypervisor with a strong protection from memory faults that would bring down the entire system."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about server memory configurations, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is configuring a new PowerEdge server for a critical database application that requires high availability and maximum usable memory.

It provides robust error protection by extending Single Device Data Correction (SDDC) to both x4 and x8 DRAMs, protecting against single DRAM chip failures during normal operation.\n\n2. Unlike Mirroring mode, which would halve the usable memory to 128GB, AECC allows the full amount of installed memory (256GB) to be usable by the system.\n\n3. Spare mode would reduce the available memory by one rank per channel, resulting in less usable memory than AECC.\n\n4. FRM mode is primarily beneficial for hypervisor installations like VMware ESXi, which is not mentioned as a requirement for this database application.\n\n5.

The behavior of the derivative as n approaches infinity is complex and depends on the value of x:\n\n1. The sum contains n terms, each with a factor of $(\\log x)^{n-i}$ which grows with n for x > 1.\n2. However, the product term $\\prod_{j=i-1}^n f_{j-1}(x)$ in the exponent also grows rapidly with n.\n3. For some values of x > 1, the growth of the logarithmic term dominates, causing divergence.\n4. For other values of x > 1, the growth in the exponent can cause the terms to become very small, potentially leading to convergence.\n\nThe specific threshold where the behavior changes is related to the fixed point of the function $x^{1/x}$, which is approximately 1.44667. For x below this value, the derivative tends to converge, while for x above it, the derivative tends to diverge.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex mathematical expressions, understand limits and convergence, and recognize that seemingly simple changes in parameters can lead to dramatically different behaviors in advanced mathematical functions.

This bound is achieved through a specific process:\n\n1. Start with $p_1 \\to 0^+$ (approaching zero from the positive side). This makes the first term approach $N_1 p_1/(N_1 p_1) = 1$.\n2. Then let $N_1 \\to 0^+$. This sets up the second term to approach $N_2 p_2^2/(N_2 p_2^2 + \\ldots)$.\n3. Next, let $p_2 \\to 0^+$, making the second term approach 1.\n4. Continue this process for each i up to t.\n\nThis sequential approach of alternating between setting $p_i$ and $N_i$ to small positive values (approaching zero) for each i allows each term in the sum to approach 1, while minimizing its impact on subsequent terms. As there are t terms, and each approaches 1, the sum S approaches t.\n\nThis question requires understanding of limit concepts, optimization, and the behavior of fractions with small numerators and denominators.

question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A senior developer is reviewing the code for a new user registration system and notices that while the stored procedure execution is not throwing any exceptions, no new users are being created. Given the provided controller, Dapper repository, and stored procedure code, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The stored procedure name is incorrectly specified in the Dapper repository method\nB) The connection string is not properly configured for executing stored procedures\nC) The parameter names in the controller don't match those in the stored procedure\nD) The stored procedure is rolling back the transaction due to an unhandled error\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue is in the Dapper repository method. The code is specifying both the EXEC statement and the parameter list in the SQL string, while also setting the command type to StoredProcedure. This is incorrect usage of Dapper for executing stored procedures.\n\nIn the CreateUser method of the Dapper repository, we see:\n\n```csharp\nstring sproc = \"EXEC sproc_NewUser @Organisation, @Client1, @Team, @Email  @UserName, @Password, @FirstName, @LastName\";\nvar result = await conn.QueryAsync(sproc, parameters, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);\n```\n\nWhen using `commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure`, Dapper expects only the name of the stored procedure, not the EXEC statement or the parameter list. The correct way to call the stored procedure would be:\n\n```csharp\nstring sproc = \"sproc_NewUser\";\nvar result = await conn.QueryAsync(sproc, parameters, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);\n```\n\nThis question requires the candidate to:\n1. Analyze the given code across multiple components (controller, repository, and stored procedure).\n2. Understand the correct usage of Dapper for executing stored procedures.\n3. Identify the subtle error in the repository method that's preventing the stored procedure from executing properly.\n4. Apply knowledge of how different components interact in a typical web application architecture.\n\nThe distractors (B, C, and D) represent plausible issues that could prevent user creation, but careful analysis of the provided code reveals that these are not the primary cause in this scenario."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/04", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47576", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/21183/"], "docs_id": 47576, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Short version: Does anyone know if X.509 client certificates are *supposed* to work on the iPad for IMAP mail? Am I wasting my time trying to get a feature that doesn't work to work? If the built\\-in mail app doesn't support IMAP with X.509 client certs (ie: they only work with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync accounts), are there any 3rd party apps that do?\n\nOnly iOS 5\\.1 or newer is of interest; 5\\.1 is the version I've been testing with.\n\n---\n\nI'm the admin of a network that's required by policy to use X.509 client certificates to protect all external communication, including our IMAP mail server (Cyrus IMAPd) and SMTP server (postfix). Neither will accept a connection without the client presenting a valid X.509 client certificate. Disabling the client certificate requirement is not an option for me, and we aren't permitted to tunnel traffic in via VPN for similar reasons.\n\nWe now have iPad users who want to connect to our network, and are finding the iPad to be a bit of a problem.\n\nFor users on desktop machines we usually install Thunderbird, as it has rock solid IMAP with excellent client certificate support; it \"just works\" and is the same to support on every platform. This isn't an option for iPad.\n\nUnfortunately the iPad's built\\-in Mail app doesn't seem to cope with client certificates for IMAP. I can install our org's root cert and the user's client cert using the iPhone Configuration Utility. Both are shown as \"verified\" in Settings\\-\\>General\\-\\>Profiles. The iPad then accepts our server as trusted and omits any warnings about the server's identity not being verified.\n\nMail still fails to send a client certificate when one is demanded so the server terminates the handshake. It doesn't prompt the user to select one, nor does it automatically send the client certificate it has installed for the user that matches the CA certificate presented by the server.\n\nExamination of the traffic flow between client and server shows that the TLS negotiation fails when the iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates when client certificates are demanded by the server. See below.\n\nWhen connected to the internal network over encrypted WiFi, where no client cert is required to get mail, the device connects and downloads mail just fine. External access (public WiFi or over 3G) fails, whether I use the IMAPs port 993 with \"Use SSL\" checked or the IMAP\\+TLS port 143 with or without \"Use SSL\" checked. Other than the apparent lack of client certificate negotiation support for IMAP, it's perfect.\n\nReferences to client certificate support in [the documentation for Apple's \"Enterprise support\"](http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iPad_Business.pdf) only appear where Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync is discussed, and where Cisco VPN support is discussed.\n\nThere are a few questions on Apple's discussion forums, but no recent ones and no useful answers. I'd link to them, but Apple's forums are \"down for maintenance\" at the moment.\n\nAs a workaround I can probably set up a locked down VPN using the iPad's automatic VPN connection support to talk to a client\\-cert authed IPSec VPN that can *only* talk to the IMAP and SMTP servers on the appropriate ports plus DNS, nothing else. It'd be a pretty gruesome hack to have to perpetrate though.\n\n---\n\nBTW, the client\\<\\-\\>server conversation is:\n\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Client Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Server Hello\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Certificate, Certificate Request, Server Hello Done\n (Sends server cert, signing root cert, \n DN of accepted client cert signer which happens to be the same as the root that signed the server cert)\n* C \\-\\> S TLSv1 Certificate\n (empty set of certificates, zero certs included)\n* S \\-\\> C TLSv1 Handshake failure\n\nIn other words, the server says \"this is me, I expect you to provide a certificate signed by authority to prove who you are\" and the client replies with \"Um, my papers are in this empty envelope here. Look, a cassowary!\"\n\nThe client has the root cert installed, and has a client cert installed that has the signer DN demanded by the server.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On a MacBook with no number pad, the key combination `fn``return` produces the Enter key. Individual programs can decide whether to treat the two keys as separate or the same. Many programs treat them the same.\n\nThe only example I have been able to come up with that still treats the two keys separately is iTunes: when browsing tracks, `return` starts playing the track, while `enter` (or `fn``return`) enters track rename mode."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An organization requires X.509 client certificates for all external communication, including IMAP and SMTP.

The correct answer is A because the documentation clearly indicates that the iPad's built-in Mail app fails to send a client certificate when one is demanded by the server, even though the necessary certificates are installed and verified on the device. This is evidenced by the TLS negotiation failure described in the packet capture, where the iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the server is properly requesting client certificates, as shown in the TLS handshake details provided. Option C is also incorrect, as the documentation states that the client has the root cert installed and a client cert that matches the signer DN demanded by the server.

The correct answer, C, represents the most effective ensemble approach because:\n\n1. It utilizes multiple neural networks, which is the core concept of ensemble methods mentioned in the documentation.\n2. Using different architectures introduces diversity in the ensemble, which can capture different aspects of the problem and reduce overall bias.\n3. A weighted average allows for optimizing the contribution of each network based on its performance, potentially improving overall accuracy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't utilize the ensemble concept at all. While a larger network might perform well, it doesn't benefit from the error-reduction properties of ensembles.\n\nOption B is a valid ensemble method and is mentioned in the documentation as a common approach. However, it's less sophisticated than C because using identical architectures may lead to correlated errors across the ensemble.\n\nOption D is a distractor that represents a misunderstanding of both ensemble methods and neural network functioning. It doesn't create separate models and misuses the concept of neural network structure.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (ensemble methods, neural network architecture, and prediction optimization) and applies them to a real-world scenario (stock market prediction).

This approach is suggested in the top answer and provides several advantages:\n\n1. It minimizes the risk of damaging the barb fitting's ribs, which is crucial for preventing leaks when the fitting is reused.\n2.

This method doesn't require special tools or potentially damaging techniques.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a PEX pipe cutter's blade risks damaging the barb fitting's ribs, as mentioned in the user's concern. Option B is incorrect as heat could potentially damage both the pipe and the fitting, and is not a recommended method for PEX removal.

The developer has added a button to each product item and wants to trigger a custom JavaScript function `quickViewPopUp` when the button is clicked. Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate and aligned with Magento 2 best practices for implementing this feature?\n\nA) Add an inline `onclick` attribute to the button element in the PHTML template\nB) Use jQuery to bind a click event handler to the button in a `<script>` tag at the end of the PHTML file\nC) Implement the feature using Knockout.js bindings and a custom component\nD) Use the `x-magento-init` script type to load a custom module and initialize the quick view functionality\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate approach for implementing the \"Quick View\" feature in Magento 2 is to use the `x-magento-init` script type to load a custom module and initialize the functionality (option D). This method aligns with Magento 2's best practices for several reasons:\n\n1. Separation of concerns: It keeps the JavaScript logic separate from the HTML template, improving maintainability.\n\n2. Modular approach: It allows the quick view functionality to be encapsulated in a reusable module.\n\n3. Proper initialization: The `x-magento-init` script ensures that the JavaScript is loaded and executed at the right time, after the DOM elements are available.\n\n4. Performance: This method supports Magento 2's built-in JavaScript bundling and minification processes.\n\nOption A (inline `onclick` attribute) is discouraged as it mixes JavaScript with HTML and makes code maintenance difficult. Option B (using jQuery in a `<script>` tag) is not recommended as it doesn't follow Magento 2's module-based architecture and can lead to performance issues. Option C (using Knockout.js) could be a valid approach for more complex scenarios, but it might be overkill for a simple quick view feature and doesn't directly address the requirement to call the custom `quickViewPopUp` function.\n\nTo implement this correctly, the developer should:\n\n1. Create a custom JavaScript module for the quick view functionality.\n2. Use the `x-magento-init` script in the PHTML template to load and initialize the module.\n3. In the custom module, implement the `quickViewPopUp` function and bind it to the button click event using Magento 2's JavaScript patterns.\n\nThis approach ensures that the feature is implemented in a way that's consistent with Magento 2's architecture and best practices for JavaScript development."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/11/30", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/624448", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/257723/"], "docs_id": 624448, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jiu4F.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jiu4F.png)I am trying to define a command called \\\\vec{} that prints a bold and non\\-italic symbol in math environment.\n\n```\n\\renewcommand{\\vec}[1]{\\mathbf{#1}}\n\n```\n\nusually works for me, but not in the documentclass ifacconf.\nInstead,\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\vect}[1]{\\mathbf{#1}}\n\n```\n\nworks here.

This class defines a command called \\undo@AMS, which is used within the \\frontmatter environment. This command redefines the \\vec command to produce bold italic text, overriding the user's attempt to redefine it with \\renewcommand.\n\nThis explanation integrates multiple concepts:\n1.

The specific behavior of the 'ifacconf' class\n\nThe question requires analysis of the given information and application of LaTeX knowledge to a real-world scenario where a user is troubleshooting unexpected behavior. It tests critical thinking about LaTeX's command definition mechanisms and class-specific behaviors rather than simple memorization.\n\nThe distractors represent plausible misconceptions:\nA) While some classes do prohibit redefinitions, this isn't the core issue here.\nB) Introduces a red herring about package compatibility.\nD) Challenges the user's understanding of what's causing the unexpected behavior.\n\nThis question targets the Analysis/Application level of Bloom's taxonomy by requiring the integration of multiple LaTeX concepts and troubleshooting skills."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/30", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185342", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/79891/"], "docs_id": 185342, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that the model should generally consist of data manipulation and the view for data display from the model, but how do I keep my model and view layers decoupled?\n\nMy simple view has a few tables that display data. Its associated model manipulates the data based on the view's type of `TableModel`. Most of its methods involve using the `TableModel` type. Should the view generally \"breakdown\" the data into a more generic type of integers and strings for the model? Therefore all the model handles are simple generic lists of data without needing to use `TableModel` in case the view is changed into another interface.

If the integration test has failed recently, then there was a defect that was not caught by the unit tests.\n\nMy preference would generally be to increase the robustness of the integration tests, to the point where they can be reliably run unattended. If they take a long time to run, then run them overnight. They are still valuable even if they are only run occasionally. If these tests are too fragile or require manual intervention, then it may not be worth the time spent in keeping them running, and you may consider discarding those that succeed most often."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is refactoring a desktop application with a GUI interface to improve its architectural design. The current implementation tightly couples the model and view layers, making it difficult to change the user interface in the future.

The correct answer, C, best addresses the core issue of decoupling the model from the view.\n\nOption C suggests redesigning the model to work with generic data structures, which aligns with the principle that the model should be \"unaware\" of the view. This approach allows the model to perform its functions regardless of the interface type (GUI, command-line, etc.), promoting flexibility and maintainability.\n\nOption A is a distractor that attempts to solve the problem at the wrong layer. While it might work, it doesn't address the root cause of the coupling.\n\nOption B puts the responsibility of data transformation on the view, which is not ideal as it doesn't fully decouple the layers and may lead to duplication of logic if multiple view types are implemented.\n\nOption D introduces unnecessary complexity and goes against the principle of having a single, interface-agnostic model.\n\nThe correct approach (C) ensures that the model can work with any interface, allowing for easier transitions between different UI types (e.g., from GUI to command-line) without modifying the core business logic.

This has around 5K lines of codes.\n\nI'm now studying the microservice architecture and see how my application would/should look like if I was using it. After reading a lot of stuff, I came to two different solutions:\n\n1. In the first one, each microservice only serve one or a very few HTTP requests. This is good because if one microsevice is down, only a small part of my previous big app is down, but the rest is still working. However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. For example, each of them has more or less the same code to generate an XML template or send request to the southbound system. I know it can be overcome by using a shared library, but then each microservice needs to use the same programming language.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)\n2. Splitting the part of my app to smaller services. Here, I avoid code duplication and each service can use a different programming language, but if a single microservice is down, everything stops working. Moreover, this looks like a monolithic architecture, because I'm just separating the layer with HTTP request instead of a class/functions interface. It seems maybe a bit easier to understand and maintain, but not really giving anything more.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)\n\nI would like to have your opinion on my personal use case as I really struggle to understand how an application in a microservice world should be designed without a concrete example.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The objective of [microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) is to provide **independently deployable, loosely coupled, lean services**. This means that you shall be able to change one of the microservices however you want, and can deploy it in production without changing the others. \n\nYour scenario 1 indeed breaks the monolith down into smaller pieces. But these are not independently deployable: \n\n> However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. (...) I know it can be overcome by using a shared library,\n\nIf you change some functionality in the shared code, you no longer are sure that it's interoperable with the other service. And if shared library is changed, you're no longer sure that the other service still compiles and could be patched for an emergency issue within minutes. \n\nYour focus seems to be reliability and continuity of the microservices that you have extracted from your legacy monolith. But the common code weakens the independent continuity of services: if you have for example a vulnerability in your shared library, both services could easily be disrupted by the same hacker. Or suffer from the same nasty UB bug. \n\nThe reliability achieved with microservice is based on true independence on the functional axis. The focus is also more on scalability (see the [scale cube](https://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html)): microservices can offer horizontal duplication (i.e. several service instances for the same API \\- if one breaks down, the clones continue to work), not to speak about partitioning. \n\nFor scenario 2, you could consider implementing fault tolerance by implementing horizontal scalability, i.e. having several instances of the same service running on different nodes. It's a tough change since the services have to find each other dynamically. But then, if one of the service instance is down in the chain, the other services upstream can find another working instance. A trick for achieveing this is to move from a [synchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/rpi.html) to [asynchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html) via event queues or a message broker. \n\nIt's difficult based on the few elements you provide to confirm if approach 2 is the best one. Perhaps another [decomposition strategy](https://chrisrichardson.net/post/refactoring/2019/10/09/refactoring-to-microservices.html) could result in even lower coupling. \n\nI could for example think of this one, which combines both of your approaches: migrating your common XML generator features into a \"Service Proxy\" (the name is arbitrary: it seemed to be a relay between your new microservices and other applications), splitting the core of the monolith into [highly cohesive but loosely coupled capabilities](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/decompose-by-business-capability.html), and hiding the details of the split to the outside world behind an [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html): \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about microservices architecture, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A large e-commerce company is refactoring its monolithic application into microservices.

I study languages such as C, C\\+\\+, Python and Java (mainly focusing on C\\+\\+). I'm what you'd call \"young and inexperienced\" and I admit that because I can't claim otherwise. \n\nAs a student, I have many other problems besides programming. I practice programming as often as I can, and especially because my teacher gives me a lot more exercises than the rest of the class (it's a very low level), so oftentimes I spend weeks doing something else such as school projects or sports, or traveling, anything besides programming.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I love programming. I love to build functional code, to watch as a program comes alive at the push of a button, and to learn as much as I can. The thing is, I simply don't have much time for it.\n\nStraight to the question, now: does your programming knowledge decrease as time passes and you don't practice? You may ask \"how much time do you mean?\". I don't mean a specific amount of time, but for reference you could take a month\\-two or even a year as an example. \n\nBy knowledge I mean anything from syntax to language functionality.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Obviously, programming is something you learn to do, not a set of facts or information. That said, it's more like riding a bike or speaking a language. There are theories too, but it's more about putting them to practice.\n\nEven so, like anything, if you don't use it your brain will start to drop the information. Your brain is like a muscle that way. After a period of time you'll most likely remember broad concepts but not specifics about syntax and lesser\\-used functions. For example, you may want to do a `for` loop or iterate over a list and know that it's something like `while List.hasNext()` or `for item in list` or `for index, item of list` but not writing it very confidently.\n\nThe good thing is, you'll know what you want to do. You just need to look it up. So I wouldn't be too worried about it. It'll come back to you. The important thing is to learn how to solve problems with programs. All programming languages are usually capable of doing the same things, but most of the time in different ways. You might forget that Ruby or Python have comprehensions and write too many `for` loops instead, but you'll get the job done.\n\nAs for how much you'll forget or remember, I think that kind of depends on how active your mind is and how old you are. I don't think I developed a fully functional brain until I was 19\\. At that point memorizing anything for me was a snap. Everyone is different.\n\nIn sum: details always fade, the rate they fade depends on you, all languages are trying to make it easy to solve the same problems, so maybe it's more important to learn how to solve problems. :)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer has been working intensively on a complex C++ project for three months.

The main predicate is *be difficult*, a predicate adjective, which uses *be* as an auxiliary, like all predicate adjectives and nouns. The other clauses are subordinate to the main clause.\n\nIf *is difficult* is the main verb phrase, what's it's subject? Well, everything else in the sentence. \n\n> (Except *it*. The *it* is a meaningless dummy, introduced by the syntactic rule of [Extraposition](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/419328/15299).)\n\n*Knowing which one to pick* is also a clause, a gerund clause with *knowing* as the gerund main verb of the clause. But every English clause needs an English subject, so whose knowing are we talking about? It's not clear. \n\n*Anybody at all, everybody, somebody, whoever you like*. It's **indefinite** who the subject is (except it does have to be a ***Who***, not a ***What***, because that's required for the subject of *know*), and since it's not there, we just don't know. But we can tell that the subject is some indefinite human, and not somebody mentioned in the conversation, so we'll just call it `Indef`, which of course, is not pronounced. Like apostrophes.\n\nSo the subject of *is difficult* is the clause\n\n* *`Indef` knowing which one to choose*\n\nand together the sentence is pronounced \n\n* *Knowing which one to choose is difficult.*\n\nThis is the sentence that's left when you unwind Extraposition. That moves a heavy subject like a gerund clause to the end of the sentence where it's easier to process, and leaves behind a dummy *It* (normally contracted to *It's* when the predicate is an adjective, as here) behind to fool us into thinking there's a subject still there so we can get to the verb fast. There are a lot of rules in English that do this, in various ways to various kinds of construction, but always in order to put heavy stuff at the end of the sentence.\n\nBut we're not done. The gerund subordinate clause *knowing which one to choose* has a subordinate clause itself: *which one to choose* is a *Wh*\\-infinitive clause, and once again its subject is missing, and once again it's indefinite.\n\n*Somebody* (indefinite) is to choose *something* (also indefinite, so it may be *somebody* instead) from a limited set of things (or people). That's the sense of *which one* instead of *what*, which could be plural and isn't limited in scope.\n\n*Wh*\\-infinitives are very restricted and have extremely peculiar syntax. The subject of *choose* is `Indef`, but the object is *which one*, moved to the front as a relative pronoun. *One* in *which one* is the indefinite singular pronoun, standing for some noun that is understood in the discourse. We don't know what (or who) is being chosen, nor by whom, but the speaker is relying on the addressee knowing what noun *one* stands for. This is not \"indefinite\" in the same logical sense \\-\\- we still don't know which one, but we know what kind of ones we're talking about.\n\nThe *Wh*\\-infinitive is the direct object of *knowing*, so that makes it a noun clause, a complement of *know*. The gerund clause itself is the subject of *is difficult*, so that makes it a noun clause, too. And of course there's Extraposition. Pretty complicated structure for such a small sentence."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the grammatical structure of the sentence \"It's difficult knowing which one to choose,\" I'll create a question that tests understanding of complex sentence structures and gerund clauses.\n\nQuestion: A linguistics student is analyzing the sentence \"It's difficult knowing which one to choose.\" Which of the following best describes the grammatical structure and function of \"knowing which one to choose\" in this sentence?\n\nA) It's an infinitive phrase functioning as the subject of the main clause\nB) It's a gerund clause acting as the true subject of the sentence, with \"it\" serving as a dummy subject\nC) It's a participial phrase modifying the adjective \"difficult\"\nD) It's a noun clause functioning as the direct object of \"is difficult\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"knowing which one to choose\" is a gerund clause that functions as the true subject of the sentence. The sentence has undergone extraposition, a syntactic process where a heavy subject (in this case, the gerund clause) is moved to the end of the sentence for ease of processing. The \"it\" at the beginning of the sentence is a dummy subject, often called an expletive or pleonastic \"it,\" which takes the place of the true subject in the sentence's surface structure.\n\nThis structure is more complex than it initially appears:\n1. The main predicate is \"is difficult,\" with \"it\" serving as a placeholder subject.\n2. The gerund \"knowing\" is the main verb of the subordinate clause that forms the true subject.\n3. \"Which one to choose\" is a further embedded wh-infinitive clause functioning as the object of \"knowing.\"\n\nThis question requires the student to analyze the sentence structure beyond surface level, understand the concept of extraposition, recognize the function of gerund clauses, and differentiate between various types of clauses and their functions in complex sentences.

There are problems with estimating the likelihood of faster runners than Mr. Bolt from record\\-setting dash times that are both obvious and subtle. Humor me by imagining this not to be the case.\n\n---\n\nUsain Bolt is the fastest human measured for the 100m dash. However, given the small number of athletes, it seems likely that the \"true\" fastest human alive is sitting on a couch somewhere and has never attempted a competitive running career.\n\nI am trying to use the fact that the difference between samples at the tails of the normal distribution become smaller and smaller. I'm using this to compute the likelihood there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt by comparing Usain to the 2nd fastest, 3rd fastest and so on.\n\nTo do this, I'm trying to compute the largest value that exists beyond \"Usain Bolt\" by taking the derivative of the normal distribution's CDF with respect to $y$, raising that to the $n$th (where $n$ is about 7,000,000,000 or the number of samples less than the \"maximum\" \\- the logic behind this is described in the [German Tank Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem) Wikipedia page which generalizes among different distributions), e.g:\n\n$\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}y f\\_{Y\\_N} (y)dy \\= \\\\lambda n \\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty} y \\\\left \\[ \\\\tfrac12\\\\left\\[1 \\+ \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left( \\\\frac{y\\-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\right ]^{n\\-1} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}}\\\\, e^{\\-\\\\frac{(y \\- \\\\mu)^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}}dy$\n\n1. Is this a valid way to compute the probability that there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt?\n2. Is there a name for this sort of question outside of \"German Tank Problem for other distributions\"\n3. Is there a good way to estimate standard deviation from the extreme samples of a distribution? Finding information about the fastest 100m dashes of all time is easy, finding averages \\& variance is hard)\n\nThank you for your patience in dealing with a programmer without a background in the topic.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contrary to other answers, I'd argue that you can say something about Bolts abilities given the available data. First of all, let's narrow your question. You are asking about fastest human, but since there is a difference in the distributions of running speeds for men and woman, where the best woman runners woman seem to be slightly slower then the best man runners, we should focus on men runners. To get some data, we can look at the [best year performances on 100 run from the last 45 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres#Men). There are several things to notice about this data:\n\n* Those are the best running times, so they do not tell us about abilities of all humans, but about the *minimal* achieved speeds.\n* We assume that this data reflects sample of the best runners in the world. While it might have happened that there were even better runners that did not participate in the championships, this assumption seems to be fairly reasonable.\n\nFirst, let's discuss how **not** to analyze this data. You could notice that if we plot the running times against time, we would observe a strong linear relationship.\n\n[![Best running times vs time](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)\n\nThis could lead you to using linear regression to forecast how much better runners we could observe in the next years. This however would be a **very bad** idea, that would inevitable lead you to conclusion that in approximately two thousand years humans would be able to run 100 meters in zero seconds, and after that they would start achieving the negative running times! This is obviously absurd, as we can imagine that there is some kind of biological and physical limit of our capacities, that is unknown to us.\n\nHow could you analyze this data? First, notice that we are dealing with data about minimal values, so we should use appropriate model for such data. This leads us to considering [extreme value theory](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/158767/why-use-extreme-value-theory) models (see e.g. *An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values* book by Stuart Coles). You can assume for this data [generalized extreme value distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution) (GEV). If $Y \\= \\\\max(X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n)$ where $X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n$ are independent and identically distributed random variables, then $Y\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution. If you are interested in modeling minimas, then if $Z\\_1,Z\\_2,\\\\dots,Z\\_k$ are samples of minimas, then $\\-Z\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution for minimas. So we can fit GEV distribution to the running speeds data, what leads to pretty nice fit (see below).\n\n[![GEV distribution for running speeds](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)\n\nIf you look at at the cumulative distribution suggested by the model, you'll notice that the best running time by Usain Bolt is in the lowest $1\\\\%$ tail of the distribution. So if we stick to this data, and this toy\\-example analysis, we would conclude that the much smaller running times are unlikely (but obviously, possible). The obvious problem with this analysis is that ignores the fact that we saw year\\-to\\-year improvements of the best running times. This gets us back to the problem described in the first part of the answer, i.e. that assuming a regression model in here is risky. Another thing that could be improved is that we could use Bayesian approach and assume informative prior that would account for some out\\-of\\-data knowledge about the physiologically possible running times, that might not yet been observed (but, as far as I know, this is unknown at present moment). Finally, similar extreme value theory was already used in sports research, e.g. by Einmahl and Magnus (2008\\) in the [Records in Athletics Through Extreme\\-Value Theory](http://cdata4.uvt.nl/websitefiles/magnus/JRM082.pdf) paper.\n\nYou could protest that you didn't ask about probability of the faster running time, but about probability of observing faster runner. Unfortunately, here we can't do much since we don't know what is the probability that a runner will become a professional athlete and the recorded running times will be available for him. This doesn't happen at random and there is lots of factors contributing to the fact that some runners become professional athletes and some don't (or even that someone likes running and runs at all). For this, we would have to have a detailed population\\-wide data on runners, moreover since you are asking about the extremes of the distribution, the data would have to be very large. So on this, I agree with the other answers."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing Usain Bolt's 100m dash record to estimate the probability of an even faster human existing.

This method is superior for several reasons:\n\n1. It properly accounts for the nature of extreme value data, which is crucial when dealing with record-setting performances.\n2. GEV modeling avoids the pitfalls of linear regression, which could lead to absurd predictions like negative running times in the future.\n3. It allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about physiological limits, which is important given the unknown upper bounds of human performance.\n4. The use of Bayesian priors can help account for out-of-sample knowledge and uncertainty in the model.\n\nOption A is incorrect because linear regression would lead to unrealistic predictions and doesn't account for the asymptotic nature of human performance improvements.\n\nOption B is flawed because it assumes a normal distribution, which is not appropriate for extreme value data like world records.\n\nOption D is overly simplistic and doesn't account for the complex statistical properties of extreme values or the potential for unobserved faster runners.\n\nThe GEV approach (Option C) has been successfully applied in sports research, as mentioned in the documentation, and provides a more nuanced and statistically sound method for analyzing the likelihood of faster runners than Bolt existing, while acknowledging the limitations of available data and the complexities of estimating human performance extremes."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/09/09", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20962", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130066/"], "docs_id": 20962, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: People make mistakes.

While it shouldn't be punitive in theory, sometimes it is \\- especially when something is clearly out of scope. On main sites, question downvotes often indicate a lack of research, information, or something that simply isn't within the scope of the site. We often edit questions for new users if the issues are minor, and comment on how to make things better. Sometimes something simply isn't in scope\n\nUsing the *appropriate* tags is important because it makes it easier to find specific sorts of questions. We clear out bad tags cause its noise. As a new user, if you really *need* a tag, and can make a case for it, it'll be added. However [reputation](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/reputation \"show questions tagged 'reputation'\") [point](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/point \"show questions tagged 'point'\") [system](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/system \"show questions tagged 'system'\") [is](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/is \"show questions tagged 'is'\") [dumb](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/dumb \"show questions tagged 'dumb'\") [stupid](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/stupid \"show questions tagged 'stupid'\") [pointless](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/pointless \"show questions tagged 'pointless'\") [ridiculous](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/ridiculous \"show questions tagged 'ridiculous'\") are textbook invalid tags \\- tags are like salt. A little goes a long way, too much causes high blood pressures. [discussion](https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/discussion \"show questions tagged 'discussion'\") will do nicely. This is PRECISELY why you need reputation to post tags.\n\nThe problem with your *original* question is really that its essentially a broad purchase recommendation. While there's workarounds, there's no real way to post a proper, universal answer to handle 'why is my computer slow'. we *typically* handle this on chat, but yes, it kind of sucks that you can't do that, but once again, that low barrier of entry keeps spammers and all but the most persistent trolls out. \n\nHandling a high traffic site isn't easy. We have a fairly large team of moderators, we have community mods, and people *still* do things like use tags we've asked them not to use. \n\nGetting rep isn't hard. As I pointed out, you need ONE quality answer, or a good question. I've always pointed folk at ESR's [asking questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) or you could do what I did and look around. (I've asked bad questions. It isn't the end of the world).\n\nThe reputation system lets us do a few things. Firstly, its our first line of defence against spammers. Secondly, it ensures quality to an extent. Finally, people love imaginary internet points. \n\nI'd add, that the reputation point system is *integral* to how we do things here.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Power dissipation in a diode is given by P = VI, where V is typically 0.6 to 0.7V for a silicon diode.\n2.

The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules. Can anyone please explain this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The third law of motion:\n\n> [When one body exerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\n\n**Edit after revisit:**\n\n> The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules.\n\nThe basic misunderstanding here is in the notion of force. Acceleration for impacts will define the force, and it is best to think of the **[dp/dt definition of force.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force)** An incoming ball does not have 10 Newton's force , it has a constant velocity, so no force . **Force is generated on impact by dp/dt.** \nImpacts with solids distribute momentum and energy on the whole solid due to the cohesiveness of the electromagnetic interactions, and the total momentum energy balance can be calculated with the impact point , and dp/dt calculated to give the force of impact.\n\nImpact on air is coming in tiny scatters and tiny dp/dt. Impact on water is similar if the ball has enough energy, molecules bounce left and right with a small dp/dt slowly dissipating the energy and dispersing the momentum.\n\n**end edit** \n\nYou ask :\n\n> Then why does'nt it bounce back when it hits a water surface ?\n\nBouncing back depends on elasticity of surfaces deformations and dissipative motions of the surfaces which absorb the energy and momentum of impact , and have to be estimated for each individual case.\n\nHave you estimated the force that the steel ball exerts on the water molecules? dp/dt will transfer momentum to all the column of water it penetrates and dissipate the energy until it hits the bottom. At the surface little except ripples because the liquid is displace\\-able with little energy/momentum needs . [Look at the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF8aQHwcKN0) for a drop falling, which has the same density as the water and small energy/momentum to transfer to see how the third law is obeyed by dissipating the impulse and still a small drop bounces back.\n\nAir is a non thinker: individual molecules have very small mass with respect to the ball and pick up the tiniest fraction from the impact diminishing the motion of the ball very slightly at best. \n\nOne has to do the calculations to see that the third law is OK ?

When a steel ball is fired into a large tank of water:\n\n1. The force is still equal and opposite (adhering to Newton's Third Law), but the way this force is distributed and dissipated is complex.\n2. The water, being a fluid, is easily displaceable, resulting in little resistance at the surface.\n3. The momentum and energy of the ball are gradually dissipated through the column of water it penetrates, rather than being reflected back as in a bounce.\n4. The force is distributed over time (dp/dt) and space as the ball moves through the water, rather than being concentrated at a single point of impact.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates that while Newton's Third Law is still valid, its application to predicting macroscopic behavior like bouncing is not straightforward in fluid media.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a rigid iron plate would demonstrate a more direct application of the law, with clear bouncing behavior.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the interaction with air molecules would be minimal due to their low mass, making it a poor illustration of the law's limitations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it introduces some complexity with the rubber surface, it doesn't as clearly demonstrate the limitations in fluid media that the water scenario does.\n\nThis question challenges students to apply their understanding of Newton's Third Law to complex, real-world scenarios, analyzing how the nature of different materials affects the manifestation of equal and opposite forces."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/26", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/137532", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/57135/"], "docs_id": 137532, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Arkham Origins, the Environment Analysis hasn't been doing much.

This solution addresses several key points:\n\n1. It solves the primary issue of static methods not being mockable, which was highlighted in the answer: \"They're very testable, but they're not mockable and thus they are not test-friendly.\"\n\n2. By extracting an interface (IFileHelper), it allows for easy mocking in unit tests, enabling isolation of the unit under test from file system operations.\n\n3. Using dependency injection (preferably through the constructor) allows for better control over dependencies and facilitates easier testing by injecting mock objects.\n\n4. This approach follows the SOLID principles, particularly the Dependency Inversion Principle, making the code more modular and flexible.\n\n5. It maintains the existing functionality while improving the overall design and testability of the system.\n\nOption A (singleton) would still present issues with global state and make true unit testing difficult. Option B (facade) doesn't fully address the mockability issue.

You can always remove that part, in order to remove them manually after verifying your compressed files.\n\nIt is important that you're in relative folder to your `dir1/`, so all paths returned by `find` are relative to the current folder, so you don't have to [convert absolute paths into relative](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2564634/55075) (this still can be done by `realpath`, e.g. `realpath --relative-to=$absolute $current`, but it will just overcomplicate the above command).\n\nOn macOS, to use `-r` argument for `xargs`, you need to install GNU `xargs` (`brew install xargs`) and use `gxargs` command instead.

The current system is inefficient and prone to errors. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in addressing these issues while ensuring data integrity and efficient use of system resources?\n\nA) Use a simple shell script with a for loop to iterate through files, compress them with gzip, and move them to the new location\nB) Implement a Python script using the os and shutil modules to handle file operations and subprocess to call gzip\nC) Utilize find with xargs to parallelize the compression process, create directory structures, and handle file operations atomically\nD) Develop a custom C program to directly manipulate file descriptors for faster I/O operations during compression and relocation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach for this task is to utilize find with xargs (Option C). This solution addresses multiple aspects of the problem:\n\n1. Parallelization: xargs can process multiple files concurrently, significantly improving performance for large datasets.\n2. Atomic operations: By using a shell command within xargs, each file is processed as an atomic operation, reducing the risk of partial failures.\n3. Directory structure preservation: The mkdir -p command ensures that the directory structure is recreated in the target location.\n4. Resource efficiency: Using standard Unix tools (find, xargs, gzip) leverages optimized system calls and avoids unnecessary overhead.\n5. Error handling: The -print0 and -0 options handle filenames with spaces or special characters correctly.\n6. Flexibility: This approach can easily be modified to handle different file types or compression methods.\n\nWhile options A and B could work, they would likely be less efficient and more prone to errors when dealing with large datasets or complex directory structures. Option D, developing a custom C program, would be overkill for this task and introduce unnecessary complexity and potential for bugs without significant performance gains over the optimized Unix tools.\n\nThe find with xargs approach demonstrates a deep understanding of Unix philosophy and tools, showcasing the ability to solve complex problems with simple, composable commands \u2013 a key skill in DevOps and system administration."}, "62": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/28", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/65047703", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/14723525/"], "docs_id": 65047703, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've looked at about every article/question on this issue that I've been able to find, but no luck \\-\\- thanks in advance for your help:\n\nIn my \"This Workbook,\" I have the following:\n\n```\nOption Explicit\n\nPublic Sub Workbook_Open()\nApplication.OnKey \"+^%{+}\", \"Insert_Columns\"\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\nIn a Module, I have the following:\n\n```\nSub Insert_Columns()\n\nDim num As String\n\nnum = InputBox(\"How many columns do you want to insert?\")\n\nIf num <> \"\" Then\n    If num > 0 Then ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Resize(1, num).EntireColumn.Insert\nEnd If\n\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\nFor some reason, the shortcut is not working.

This solution combines several advanced TikZ techniques:\n\n1. Custom pic definition: The circs pic encapsulates the logic for creating individual tree structures, including conditional formatting for white/gray nodes based on numbering.\n\n2. Matrix library: This allows for organized placement of multiple trees and associated text in a grid-like structure, facilitating the overall layout of the algorithm steps.\n\n3. Parameterized node creation: The pic definition uses arguments to dynamically create nodes with appropriate numbering and coloring, allowing for easy modification of the tree structure across steps.\n\n4. Integrated arrow drawing: The pic includes internal commands to draw connections between nodes, ensuring consistent tree structure.\n\n5. Inter-diagram arrows: The matrix structure allows for easy addition of arrows between diagrams using node anchors.\n\nThis approach is superior to the other options because:\n- It's more flexible and maintainable than manual positioning (A)\n- It allows for better integration of trees and explanatory text than separate environments (C)\n- It's more suitable for tree structures than the graphs library, which is overkill for this application (D)\n\nThe solution demonstrates a high level of LaTeX and TikZ expertise, combining multiple advanced features to create a complex, yet easily modifiable visualization of the heap sort algorithm."}, "67": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/31", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/550399", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/339321/"], "docs_id": 550399, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Wondering what **shuffle** does if I set it to True when splitting a dataset into train and test splits.

Scikit\\-learn has the [`TimeSeriesSplit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) functionality for this.\n\nThe `shuffle` parameter is needed to prevent non\\-random assignment to to train and test set. With `shuffle=True` you split the data randomly. For example, say that you have balanced binary classification data and it is ordered by labels. If you split it in 80:20 proportions to train and test, your test data would contain *only* the labels from one class. Random shuffling prevents this.\n\nIf random shuffling would break your data, this is a good argument for not splitting randomly to train and test. In such cases, you would use splits on time, or clustered splits (say you have data on education, so you sample whole schools to train and test, rather than individual students).\n\nWhen should you use `shuffle=False`? TL;DR never.\n\n* Your data was randomly sampled or was already shuffled. But shuffling one more time wouldn't hurt you. I remember seeing multiple datasets that were supposed to be randomly shuffled but weren't.\n* Your dataset is huge, so shuffling makes the whole pipeline a little bit slower. If that is the case, you probably don't want to use scikit\\-learn pipelines for preprocessing as well. If you use instead something else that scales better, still you need to make sure that it shuffles the data.\n* You don't want to split randomly and your data is already arranged in the way how you want to split it, for example, you have data collected during the 2010\\-2020 period and you want to split in 80:20 proportions with years 2010\\-2018 in train set and 2019\\-2020 in test set. Here it makes sense, but you would probably would like to use the `TimeSeriesSplit` functionality instead or write the code by hand to have greater control on what you are doing. For example, if you want to split by years, you probably don't want by accident few days of one year to land in other set than the rest of the year\\-\\-so you would rather do the split manually."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working with a large financial dataset containing daily stock prices and trading volumes over the past 10 years.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The dataset is time-series data (daily stock prices over 10 years), which exhibits auto-correlation.\n2. The documentation explicitly states that for time-series data, \"you should not split the data randomly to train and test set, but you should rather split it on time.\"\n3. Scikit-learn's TimeSeriesSplit functionality is specifically mentioned as the appropriate tool for handling time-series data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because random shuffling would break the temporal structure of the data, which is crucial for predicting future stock prices based on historical patterns.\n\nOption C, while maintaining the temporal order, is less ideal than using TimeSeriesSplit(). The latter allows for multiple train-test splits, which can provide a more robust evaluation of the model's performance across different time periods.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as the documentation states, you should \"never\" use shuffle=False.

Given a point in an $n$\\-dimensional cloud of iid standard normals, shrink it radially a chosen proportion of the way to the corresponding fractile of a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball.\n\nFor iid standard normals in $n$ dimensions, the distance from the origin has a $\\\\chi\\_n$ distribution. Let $F\\_n(d)$ denote its cdf. For a uniform distribution in the unit\\-radius $n$\\-ball, the cdf of the distance from the origin is $d^n$, and the inverse cdf is $p^{1/n}$. So multiply each point's coordinate vector by $1 \\+ \\\\alpha(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}/d \\- 1\\)$, where $\\\\alpha$ is the chosen proportion and $d$ is the observed distance of the point from the origin.\n\nEDIT \\-\\- A minor improvement, that makes the results easier to interpret: Scale the ball so that the mean square distance of the points from the origin is the same as the normal, $n$. The corresponding multiplier on the vector of normals is $1 \\+ \\\\alpha\\\\,(F\\_n(d)^{1/n}\\\\sqrt{n\\+2}\\\\,/d \\- 1\\)$.\n\nI have no proof that the marginal distribution is unimodal, but I have looked at histograms of marginal distributions with $\\\\alpha \\= 0, .05, \\\\ldots, 1$ for $n \\= 1, \\\\ldots, 10$, and they all look as they should, varying smoothly from $\\\\mathrm{N}(0,1\\)$ to a shifted and scaled $\\\\mathrm{Beta}(\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2},\\\\frac{n\\+1}{2})$. For $n \\= 2$ I have also looked at scatter plots with the same set of $\\\\alpha$\\-values, and they too look as they should, with no \"bald spot\" in the middle.\n\nHere is Mathematica code whose results are organized to facilitate exploring the effect of $\\\\alpha$.\n\n```\n{m, n} = { sample size, # of dimensions };\nz = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {m, n}];\ny = z * With[{dd = Total[z^2, {2}]},\n    CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n], dd]^(1/n) * Sqrt[(n + 2)/dd]];\n\n```\n\nThen `x = alpha*y + (1-alpha)*z` will be a matrix that varies smoothly with `alpha` between iid normal (`alpha = 0`; pure `z`) and a uniform n\\-ball (`alpha = 1`; pure `y`). Here are scatter plots of 5000 points in 2 dimensions for `alpha = {0, .25, .50, .75, 1}`.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VSOTd.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about generating platykurtic, globular multivariate data, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist wants to generate a multivariate continuous dataset that is globular like a standard normal distribution but more platykurtic. They decide to use the method described in the documentation. Which of the following statements best describes the process and its implications?\n\nA) The method involves shrinking each point towards the origin by a fixed percentage, resulting in a uniformly distributed dataset within a hypersphere.\n\nB) The approach transforms standard normal data by adjusting points based on their distance from the origin, allowing for a smooth transition between normal and uniform distributions in a unit n-ball.\n\nC) The technique applies a non-linear transformation to each coordinate independently, resulting in marginal distributions that are always Beta-distributed.\n\nD) The method scales the entire dataset to maintain a constant volume, ensuring that the kurtosis decreases uniformly across all dimensions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately describes the key aspects of the method presented in the documentation. The approach starts with standard normal data and transforms each point based on its distance from the origin. This transformation involves shrinking points radially towards the corresponding fractile of a uniform distribution in a unit n-ball. \n\nThe method allows for a smooth transition between a standard normal distribution (when \u03b1 = 0) and a uniform distribution in the unit n-ball (when \u03b1 = 1). This is achieved by using the formula: x = \u03b1*y + (1-\u03b1)*z, where z is the original normal data point, y is the transformed point, and \u03b1 is the chosen proportion for the transformation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the method doesn't simply shrink points by a fixed percentage, nor does it result in a uniformly distributed dataset for all \u03b1 values.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the marginal distributions do approach a Beta distribution as \u03b1 increases, they are not always Beta-distributed, and the transformation is applied to the entire point, not to each coordinate independently.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the method doesn't focus on maintaining a constant volume. Instead, it adjusts the scale to maintain the same mean square distance from the origin as the original normal distribution.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding the transformation process, its effects on the distribution, and how it allows for varying degrees of platykurtosis while maintaining a globular shape."}, "70": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/26", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40230", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/7428/"], "docs_id": 40230, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One of our senior developers has stated that we should be using a naming convention for stored procedures with an \"objectVerb\" style of naming such as (\"MemberGetById\") instead of a \"verbObject\" type of naming (\"GetMemberByID\"). The reasoning for this standard is that all related stored procedures would be grouped together by object rather than by the action.\n\nWhile I see the logic for this way of naming things, this is the first time that I have seen stored procedures named this way.

They are considering two approaches: \"objectVerb\" (e.g., \"MemberGetById\") and \"verbObject\" (e.g., \"GetMemberById\"). Which of the following statements best reflects the advantages of the \"objectVerb\" approach in the context of modern software development practices?\n\nA) It improves query execution speed by optimizing database indexing\nB) It aligns with object-oriented programming principles and improves code-to-database mapping\nC) It enhances database security by obfuscating procedure names\nD) It reduces the overall number of stored procedures required in the database\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \"objectVerb\" naming convention (e.g., \"MemberGetById\") offers several advantages that align with modern software development practices, particularly in object-oriented programming environments. This approach groups related stored procedures by object rather than by action, which mirrors how methods are typically organized in object-oriented code.\n\nThe correct answer (B) highlights this alignment between database procedure naming and object-oriented programming principles. In OOP, methods are typically associated with objects, such as `MyObject.GetById(int)`. By using the \"objectVerb\" convention for stored procedures, developers create a naming structure that closely resembles this object-method relationship (e.g., `MyObjectGetById`).\n\nThis similarity facilitates easier mapping between application code and database procedures, improving code readability and maintainability. It allows developers to quickly identify all procedures related to a specific object, which is particularly beneficial in large systems with numerous stored procedures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the naming convention doesn't directly affect query execution speed or database indexing. Option C is a misconception; while obfuscation can be a security technique, it's not a primary goal or benefit of this naming convention.

After successfully addressing this issue with a planer, they discover a similar problem in another room, but this time spanning a larger area with nearby gas and electrical lines. What approach should the homeowner consider for this new challenge?\n\nA) Use the same planer method as before, working carefully around utility lines\nB) Apply a self-leveling compound over the entire subfloor area\nC) Remove and replace the affected subfloor sections, taking precautions around utilities\nD) Install a transition strip to bridge the height difference between the two areas\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of problem-solving skills in a new context. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The original solution (planing) worked well for a small area, but the question specifies this new problem spans a larger area, making planing less practical and potentially more risky.\n\n2. The presence of gas and electrical lines near the subfloor increases the complexity and risk of the situation. This calls for a more comprehensive approach that allows for careful inspection and protection of these utilities.\n\n3. Removing and replacing the affected subfloor sections is the most thorough solution for a larger area. It addresses the root cause of the unevenness and allows for proper installation of new, level subfloor material.\n\n4.

If I have a logistic regression model that gives the probability a sandwich is more than 12 inches how do I use that probability to estimate how long the sandwich actually is? If the model says the sandwich has a 65\\.5% chance of being more than 12 inches long does that imply a length the sandwich actually is?

And note that this already presupposes that there are no sandwiches of negative length, which sounds reasonable for sandwiches, but may not hold in non\\-sandwich applications.\n\nOn the other hand, your sandwich can be of any expected length larger than that, simply by shifting the probability mass of this simple example to the right of 12 inches.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The logistic regression model only provides a probability for a binary outcome (>12 inches or not), which is insufficient to directly estimate the actual length.\n\n2.

Which combination of actions would be most effective in achieving this goal while maintaining system stability and security?\n\nA) Uninstall OneDrive, disable Windows Defender, and remove Cortana from the taskbar\nB) Use Group Policy Editor to disable web search, turn off Windows Defender, and prevent installation of consumer content\nC) Run third-party debloating scripts, disable Bing search in the Start menu, and uninstall all pre-installed apps\nD) Change the default search engine in Edge, disable lock screen ads, and turn off Cortana\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most effective and balanced approach for creating a streamlined Windows 10 Pro environment while maintaining stability and security. Here's why:\n\n1. Using Group Policy Editor ensures that changes are applied system-wide and are less likely to be reversed by updates.\n\n2. Disabling web search in the Start menu improves privacy and reduces unnecessary network traffic without completely removing useful local search functionality.\n\n3. Turning off Windows Defender through Group Policy is a more robust method than simply uninstalling it, which could leave the system vulnerable if not replaced with an alternative security solution.\n\n4. Preventing installation of consumer content (like Candy Crush) stops unwanted apps from being automatically installed, reducing bloat.\n\nOption A is less effective because it doesn't address all the issues and may leave the system vulnerable without Defender. Option C is too aggressive and may cause stability issues by using third-party scripts and removing all pre-installed apps, some of which may be necessary. Option D addresses some user interface concerns but doesn't tackle the core bloatware and privacy issues.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about balancing system optimization with stability and security."}, "85": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/03", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/535837", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/101753/"], "docs_id": 535837, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Postfix server setup which works fine most of the time but between 100 \\- 200 mails gets deferred every day with the following errors:\n\n```\nstatus=deferred (lost connection with alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[74.125.142.27] while sending RCPT TO)\n\nstatus=deferred (lost connection with mta6.am0.yahoodns.net[66.196.118.34] while sending message body)\n\n```\n\nThat's around 10 % of all outgoing mails.

This isn't some form of grey\\-listing test to see how you implement queueing.\n\nAs others have pointed out, 99\\.9% of 554's are issued because you message failed an anti\\-spam test. The fact that you get the 554 after the end of DATA suggests that there is something in the content of the message that they don't like, although the server *could* have already decided that it's going to reject your message much earlier than that and has been configured to wait until the end for various reasons (1\\. waste your time/bandwidth/resources, and 2\\. gather as much information about your message as possible).\n\nThe hardest part of these situations is that you're failing policies that are developed and enforced by the receiving end; they might be rejecting your message because the body has the word \"apple\" in it and the last octet of your IP address is a multiple of 3 for all we know. Highly unlikely, but possible.\n\nMessages usually aren't rejected based on failure of 1 criteria, especially by \"the big boys\", so I would *guess* that you're failing multiple tests, but the only way to find out exactly (considering the lack of information in the rejection message) is to ask them unfortunately.\n\nI found [this page](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/69585?hl=en) for Google in relation to your problem which may be a good path to follow.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The problem is intermittent, affecting only 10% of outgoing emails, which suggests it's not a global configuration issue like DNS or MTU settings.\n\n2. The administrator confirmed that DNS settings, including reverse DNS, are correct, and the ISP verified MTU settings, ruling out options A and B.\n\n3. The key evidence is in the bounced email logs, which show a 554 5.7.1 error code after the DATA command. This typically indicates a content-based rejection rather than a connection or configuration issue.\n\n4. Both Gmail and Yahoo are returning similar 554 5.7.1 errors, suggesting a common anti-spam mechanism rather than a provider-specific issue.\n\n5. The administrator's test of sending a new email to the same recipient succeeds, while forwarding the problematic email fails. This strongly implies that the content of the original email is triggering spam filters.\n\n6. The SMTP dialogue anomaly (RSET after RCPT TO) observed in the tcpdump is likely a consequence of the server's attempt to handle the rejection, rather than the cause of the problem.\n\nOption D is a plausible distractor because of the SMTP dialogue anomaly, but it doesn't explain the content-based rejections or the success of newly composed emails.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex system interactions, understand email protocols and anti-spam mechanisms, and differentiate between symptoms and root causes in a real-world troubleshooting scenario."}, "86": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/12/30", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/96094", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/31547/"], "docs_id": 96094, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are three single\\-letter words.

The behavior of `wrap(fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4)` is equivalent to `partial(fn4, partial(fn3, partial(fn2, fn1)))`. Which of the following best describes the primary functional programming concept being employed, and what potential benefit does this implementation offer in real-world scenarios?\n\nA) Function composition with lazy evaluation, allowing for efficient pipeline creation in data processing workflows\nB) Currying with partial application, enabling flexible function customization for context management\nC) Monadic chaining, facilitating error handling and side effect management in complex operations\nD) Higher-order function folding, optimizing recursive operations in functional data structures\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The `wrap` function is primarily employing currying with partial application, which is a key concept in functional programming. Currying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. In this case, the `wrap` function is creating a chain of partially applied functions, where each function in the chain takes the previous function as an argument.\n\nThe implementation offers several benefits in real-world scenarios:\n\n1. Flexibility in function composition: It allows developers to create customized function pipelines by combining multiple functions in a specific order.\n\n2. Context management: As mentioned in the documentation, this pattern provides similar functionality to context managers or decorators in Python, allowing pre- and post-execution behaviors to be encapsulated in a single function.\n\n3. Layered functionality: It enables the creation of layered behaviors, where each function in the chain can add its own functionality or modify the behavior of the inner functions.\n\n4. Reusability: The pattern promotes the creation of small, reusable functions that can be combined in various ways to create more complex behaviors.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are related concepts in functional programming, they don't accurately describe the primary concept being used here. Lazy evaluation (A) is not explicitly mentioned or implemented. Monadic chaining (C) is a more specific pattern often used in languages like Haskell for managing effects, which is not the focus here. Higher-order function folding (D) is related but doesn't capture the essence of the currying and partial application being used.\n\nThe correct answer (B) best describes the concept and its practical applications in the given context, aligning with the developer's goal of creating a flexible way to layer functions and manage execution contexts."}, "88": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/22", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/247999", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/37429/"], "docs_id": 247999, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just learnt about the expression \"to bite the bullet\", meaning *Accept the inevitable impending hardship and endure the resulting pain with fortitude* (as seen in [its article](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/bite-the-bullet.html) in phrases.org).\n\nI have read about its origin, but it looks a bit unclear or disputed, since different historical reasons appear in [its Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite_the_bullet).\n\nIs there any authoritative or more relevant source to get to know its origin?

An interesting article appeared about a .50 caliber bullet found at the site of the Battle of Ox Hill. The 21st Massachusetts Regiment had fought at a local cornfield with extreme and horrifying injuries. Yet, they had no medical care. The bullet has molar tooth cusp imprints, reportedly from a patient biting during surgery without anesthesia.\n\nAn evidence possibly showing the origin of the phrase is the tooth marks found on a 200\\-year\\-old musket ball on display at *The Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry*:\n\n> ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcuwR.jpg)\n> \n> \n> The bullet on display at the museum was excavated from what is now the Northport section of Baltimore but is believed to have been a field hospital during the War of 1812\\. University of Maryland Dental School pathologist and forensic odontologist Dr. Bernard Levy analyzed the musket ball and verified the impressions are from a human\u2019s dentition.\n> \n> \n> This makes the musket ball a rare find because while many lead musket balls from the Civil War and prior conflicts have been found with teeth marks on them, Dr. Swank said the vast majority have been chewed on by feral hogs who rooted them from the ground. Spotting the difference between a bullet chewed by a hog and one a human chomped on to withstand a painful medical procedure takes some skill, but dental professionals are best equipped to notice.\n> \n> \n> *[http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting\\-bullet](http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting-bullet)*\n\nHere is another evidence, chewed bullets from [the Battle of Antietam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam).

They think that people wouldn't put easily swallowed bullets in their mouth during surgeries and bite marks on the bullets are mostly from animals and especially from hogs.\n\nHere is a plausible explanation from an antique medical, surgical \\& dental artifacts resource site:\n\n> So\\-called medical chewed or pain bullets are mis\\-identified. An easily swallowed bullet is the last thing that one would want to put in the mouth of any anxious patient. To bite the bullet is not a medical phrase, rather it is an old military term referring to loading a muzzleloader. The tip of a preloaded ball and powder paper cartridge was opened with the soldier's teeth, the powder and ball were then poured into the muzzle, the paper cartridge, itself, came next as packing, lastly, all was tamped down with a ram rod. In the heat of battle, it is possible that soldiers may have bitten the paper cartridge at the wrong end (bullet end) and this may have caused some of the marks.\n> \n> \n> *<http://www.antiquescientifica.com/alerts.htm>*\n\n*[Ciwilwarscholars.com](http://civilwarscholars.com/2011/10/myth-no-2-biting-on-the-bullet-for-pain-george-wunderlich/)* and *[civilwarvirtualmuseum.org](http://www.civilwarvirtualmuseum.org/medicine/field-medicine/bitten-bullets.php)* are among the sources that are against the *pain bullet* idea. For example, in one of the sources, it is mentioned that both chloroform and ether were available for administration before surgery. The first method of anesthesia, nitrite oxide, was introduced in 1844; ether as an anesthetic was first used by Horace Wells (an American dentist) in 1846; and the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson first used the anesthetic qualities of chloroform in 1847\\. But there is an evidence that there are chewed bullets with human bite marks that are older than the discovery of anesthesia.\n\nAlthough there are some plausible explanations against the theory, most authoritative sources favor it. So we can conclude that there is strong evidence from authoritative sources that pain bullets were used during surgeries; and it is the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet\".\n\n---\n\nBonus readings:\n\n* *<http://www.pochefamily.org/books/MeltedLead.html>*\n* *<http://www.mytreasurespot.com/main/read.php?5,92836,93227>*\n* *[http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain\\-bullet.25666/](http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain-bullet.25666/)*"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet,\" here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A historian is researching the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet\" and comes across conflicting evidence. Which of the following scenarios best explains the complexity surrounding the phrase's origin while demonstrating critical analysis of the available information?\n\nA) The phrase originated solely from military jargon related to loading muzzleloaders, with no connection to medical practices.\n\nB) The evidence of chewed bullets predating anesthesia discovery suggests multiple origins, including both medical and military contexts.\n\nC) The phrase's origin is definitively linked to Civil War medical practices, as evidenced by pain bullets found at battle sites.\n\nD) Modern dental forensics have conclusively disproven any connection between the phrase and historical medical practices.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about conflicting evidence. The correct answer, B, best reflects the complexity of the phrase's origin:\n\n1. It acknowledges the evidence of chewed bullets with human bite marks, some predating the discovery of anesthesia (1844-1847). This supports the medical origin theory.\n\n2. It recognizes the alternative explanation related to military practices of biting cartridges to load muzzleloaders, which is a plausible non-medical origin.\n\n3. It avoids oversimplification by not claiming a single definitive origin, reflecting the disputed nature of the evidence.\n\n4. It demonstrates critical thinking by considering the chronology of anesthesia discovery in relation to the evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the substantial evidence supporting the medical origin theory. Option C overstates the conclusiveness of the Civil War evidence, ignoring earlier examples and alternative explanations. Option D is incorrect because while some sources dispute the medical origin, modern forensics have actually supported the authenticity of some human-chewed bullets, not disproven the connection.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze conflicting historical evidence, consider multiple perspectives, and draw a nuanced conclusion based on available information \u2013 skills essential for historical and linguistic research."}, "89": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/18", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/8918877", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/896997/"], "docs_id": 8918877, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: in my android app, when i rotate/tilt my device, i want to rotate my button controls in the opposite direction, which compensates the device's orientation. kinda like the idea of screen orientation in android\n\nhere is my sensor class:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    synchronized (this) {\n        double alpha = 0.8;\n        double gravity[] = new double[3];\n        switch (event.sensor.getType()){\n            case Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER:\n                // alpha is calculated as t / (t + dT)\n                // with t, the low-pass filter's time-constant\n                // and dT, the event delivery rate                                  \n                //gravity[0] = alpha * gravity[0] + (1 - alpha) * event.values[0];\n                //gravity[1] = alpha * gravity[1] + (1 - alpha) * event.values[1];\n                //gravity[2] = alpha * gravity[2] + (1 - alpha) * event.values[2];\n\n                //sensorX = event.values[0] - gravity[0];\n                //sensorY = event.values[1] - gravity[1];\n                //sensorZ = event.values[2] - gravity[2];\n                    //ignore this section!\n            break;\n        case Sensor.TYPE_ORIENTATION:   \n                sensorZ = event.values[0];\n                sensorX = event.values[1];\n                sensorY = event.values[2];\n                outputZ.setText(\"Z:\"+Float.toString(event.values[0]));\n                outputX.setText(\"X:\"+Float.toString(event.values[1]));\n                outputY.setText(\"Y:\"+Float.toString(event.values[2]));\n                //Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"SWITCH TO \",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n                //RelativeLayout s_r_t = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.snap_r_t);\n                //RotateView r_flash = new RotateView(this , s_r_t.getWidth(), s_r_t.getHeight(), 90)(RotateView) findViewById(R.id.flash);\n                //RotateView r_flash = new RotateView(this , s_r_t.getWidth(), s_r_t.getHeight(), 90);\n                s_r_t.addView(r_flash);\n                //s_r_t.setLayoutParams(params)\n                //flash.getWidth();\n                //flash.getHeight();\n\n        break;\n\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nalong with my extended button:\n\n```\n public class RotateView extends Button {\n\nprivate float cx,cy;\nprivate double degree;\nprivate Button button;\n\npublic RotateView(Context context , int x, int y, double deg) {\n    super(context);     \n    cx = (float)x/2;\n    cy = (float)y/2;\n    degree = deg;\n}\n\npublic RotateView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {\n    super(context, attrs);\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {\n     canvas.save();\n     canvas.rotate((float)degree,cx,cy);\n     super.onDraw(canvas);\n     canvas.restore();\n\n}\n\n}\n\n```\n\nhow do i create my button with the extended button class?\n\nhere is my button:\n\n```\n flash = (Button)findViewById(R.id.flash);\n\n```\n\nbasically, this is what i want to achieve(pseudo code):\n\n```\nnew button = find my button id;\nonSensorChanged{\n set button rotation to sensor.getdata degrees;\n}\n\n```\n\nif possible, please give complete segments of the code, i've seen many answers almost answered my question, but missing the essential part of how to implement the extended button back to my button in my main class.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\n    ImageButton button= (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.test_image);\n    Bitmap bMap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.test);\n    Matrix mat = new Matrix();\n    mat.postRotate(deg);\n    Bitmap bMapRotate = Bitmap.createBitmap(bMap, 0, 0, bMap.getWidth(), bMap.getHeight(), mat, true);\n    button.setImageBitmap(bMapRotate);\n\n```"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer is implementing a feature to rotate UI controls in the opposite direction of device tilt to maintain a consistent visual orientation.

Here's why:\n\n1. The top answer in the documentation provides a solution using Matrix transformations on a Bitmap, which is more efficient than redrawing the entire view.\n\n2. This method allows for smooth, continuous rotation updates as the sensor data changes, rather than relying on discrete orientation changes.\n\n3. It doesn't require creating a custom View class (like RotateView), which can be more complex to implement and potentially less performant.\n\n4. The Matrix transformation can be applied directly to the existing Button without needing to replace it with a custom subclass.\n\n5. This approach integrates well with the sensor data provided by onSensorChanged, allowing for precise control over the rotation angle.\n\n6. It's more flexible than relying on screen orientation changes, which are limited to 90-degree increments and may affect the entire layout.\n\nWhile option A (using RotateView) could work, it's less efficient as it requires redrawing the entire view on each rotation.

Also, `A./B` occurs twice and could be done with a single AND.\n\nIf you're implementing in gates, you can pretty much directly convert to logic as shown in the circuit below. You may well find that some terms can be optimised because they are shared between segments: for example, I've shared `/A`, `/B` etc, but you can find shared terms after the AND gates. (NB: following is for common cathode seven\\-segment display, common anode would be similar but with some logic reversal, as you generate `/outa` etc, not `outa`.)

The correct answer is C because the lemma states that for any C\u00b9 isometry f on an open connected subset U of the hyperbolic plane, f can be represented as a M\u00f6bius transformation of the form (Aw+B)/(Cw+D) with AD-BC=1. This applies to our isometry u: \u03a9 \u2192 H\u00b2 since \u03a9 is given as a connected domain in H\u00b2, and u is a C\u00b9 orientation-preserving isometry. The lemma doesn't impose any additional conditions on the shape of the domain or geodesic preservation, making options B and D incorrect.

This equivalence is based on the principle of inverse transform sampling.\n\nIn Method A, we accept the new point \u03b8* with probability min(r,1), where r is the acceptance ratio. In Method B, we generate a uniform random number U and accept \u03b8* if U < r.\n\nThe equivalence can be proven as follows:\n1. When r \u2264 1, the probability of acceptance in Method A is exactly r. In Method B, P(U < r) = r when r \u2264 1, so the probability of acceptance is also r.\n2. When r > 1, the probability of acceptance in Method A is 1 (since min(r,1) = 1). In Method B, P(U < r) = 1 when r > 1, so the probability of acceptance is also 1.\n\nThis shows that for all values of r, the probability of accepting the new point is identical in both methods. The use of uniform random sampling in Method B is an application of inverse transform sampling, which allows us to generate samples from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they imply a difference in efficiency or effectiveness between the methods, which doesn't exist.
