Maximum current draw is 15 A or 20 A. Is this \"maximum\" expressed in terms of **RMS** or **peak**? The \"maximum\" seems to imply peak.\n\nExtension to this question: If I plug multiple devices into a power strip with a 15 A fuse, should I be worried about the **total peak** current or **total RMS** current of the devices?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like Brian said, it's measured in RMS.\n\nFor the extension: RMS again. For fast\\-blow fuses, the current rating is the **maximum current guaranteed at which the fuse will not blow.** But the fuse won't immediately blow at 15\\.1A \\-\\- the time vs. current graphs are provided for most fuses. Here's an example:\n\n[![Average Time Current graph](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZiGs.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZiGs.png)\n\nAs we can see, a 15A fuse is guaranteed not to blow at 15A. As the current increases, the time it takes for the fuse to blow decreases. A 15A fuse may take a minute to blow at 20A, but 0\\.3 seconds to blow at 30A.\n\nEven though your 15Arms current is actually over 21A peak, the time that it goes above the 15A rating (\\~4ms per half cycle) is not sufficient to blow the fuse. Due to the fuse's thermal inertia you may want to derate the curve a bit, but at 15Arms you should be fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A power strip with a 15 A fuse is used to connect multiple devices. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the current considerations?\n\nA) The total peak current of all devices should not exceed 15 A to avoid blowing the fuse.\nB) The total RMS current of all devices should not exceed 15 A for safe operation.\nC) The fuse will immediately blow if the total current exceeds 15 A at any instant.\nD) Peak current is more important than RMS current when considering fuse ratings.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The RMS (Root Mean Square) current is the relevant measure for fuse ratings and electrical safety in this context. The 15 A rating of the fuse refers to the RMS current, not the peak current. \n\nOption A is incorrect because peak current can exceed 15 A without blowing the fuse, as long as the RMS current stays within limits.\n\nOption C is false because fuses have thermal inertia and don't blow instantly. The time-current characteristics of the fuse determine how quickly it will blow based on the amount of overcurrent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because RMS current is more important than peak current for continuous operation and fuse ratings in AC systems.\n\nThe RMS current provides a measure of the heating effect and average power, which is what matters for the fuse and overall circuit safety in continuous operation. Users should ensure that the total RMS current draw of all connected devices doesn't exceed the 15 A rating of the power strip's fuse for safe and proper operation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/17", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/282537", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/150142/"], "docs_id": 282537, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently switched to Linux from Windows and really like Ubuntu but I have alot of Windows games I can't play anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Free solution\n-------------\n\nThere are several ways to run Windows games on Ubuntu. You could try [Play On Linux](http://www.playonlinux.com/en/), which is a front end of Wine.

They are not equivalent by any means, but have some important similarities. When you estimate a posterior mode, you're doing Bayesian \"maximum likelihood\". \n\nThe posterior mode is not often preferred because the sampling distribution of this value can be very irregular. That's for two reasons: the posterior may have many local maximae and mode estimation is very inefficient except when making strong assumptions. These points are moot when doing exact Bayes, in which case the posterior is known to fall into a parametric family. But doing Gibbs Sampling all higgeldy piggeldy will not guarantee that the posterior falls into any \"known\" family of distributions.\n\nIn basic probability problems, it's easy to obtain exact expressions for posteriors when there are constraining assumptions made about the distribution of sample data and the specification of the prior.

The hard surface encountered is likely the brick behind the plaster. The stud finder doesn't work because there are no wooden studs in a brick wall.

First, they are made of much harder metals \\- if you feel them compared to another deadbolt there is a noticable weight difference. These deadbolts also often have balls at the end that push out of the bolt when fully expanded so it cannot be forced back in. Also, the keys for these locks can only be made (not copied) by the locksmith who originally created them (each locksmith is assigned a \"keyway\" and is the only locksmith who can produce the keys), this is handy if you have a cleaning lady or other service person since you can rest assure they cannot make a copy of the key for their friends. There are also metal rings you can put around a deadbolt that spin so that someone cannot use a wrench to twist if off.\n\nIf your doors hinges are on the outside then you can also look at having bolts installed on the inside of the door.

There is a reason.\n\nI used \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$ in the same way and context as is found at [this Wiki page on RLC circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLC_circuit#Series_circuit). If you look at the first\\-order co\\-efficient in the denominator's quadratic, you'll see the expression, \\\\$2\\\\zeta\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\\\$. In my use and in the Wiki page's use, \\\\$\\\\alpha \\= \\\\zeta\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\\\$, picking up the last two factors of that expression.\n\nHowever, there are some writers discussing this very topic who use it to instead mean the first two factors, choosing to set \\\\$\\\\alpha\\=2\\\\zeta\\\\$. For an example, see [this electronics tutorial on active bandpass filters](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_7.html) and search for the term, \"Quality Factor,\" within it. In that context (not mine), \\\\$\\\\alpha\\=\\\\frac1{Q}\\\\$.\n\nI can't say I understand why this practice occurs. The damping factor, \\\\$\\\\zeta\\\\$, is by itself sufficient and arguably serves the purpose better. There's no need to create a nearly identical variable, differing only by a factor of 2\\. Let alone the fact that doing so, while re\\-purposing a symbol used in the same context, serves more to confuse than to clarify.

As the final circuit should be as small as possible, my component choices are very limited. \n\nFurthermore, the flyback switch should be driven by a max. voltage of 2V DC. My current problem is now, that there are currently no MOSFET devices available with a Vdss high enough.\n\nMy question now: Are BJTs feasible as a switch (higher breakdown voltage) and if so do they consume any power when turned off? (I am guessing not). Is it possible to drive them from only 2V?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have recently finished a similar design. We are now at the pre\\-production phase, having already validated the first prototypes, which operate perfectly under similar constraints as the ones you describe in your question. Because of IPR limitations, I can only give you some general guidelines.\n\nBased on the following assumptions:\n\n* You are trying to avoid the use of a transformer by all means (which may not be the case),\n* The power requirements of the load is in the miliwatt range,\n* You don't want to step\\-up the voltage supply first, but will use the 2VDC directly for powering your flyback design block.\n* You need to keep the cost and PCB space to the absolute minimum.\n\nI suggest the following approach:\n\n1. Rule out the MOSFET and use a fast switching high voltage BJT (rated at least to 200V, better yet to 300V).\n2. Select the most appropriate inductor for your constraints and depending on your requirements for maximum power delivered to the load.\n3. Calculate the maximum flyback voltage, and make sure you can get at more than 200V voltage flyback \"peaks\". The involved parameters here are: ILpk (inductor peak current), Cts (total sum of parasitic capacitances at the flyback node) and SWITCHING SPEED of the BJT.\n4. The last one is hugely important, and rarely mentioned in the technical literature. You may have a big ILpk and very little Cts, but if your switching (off) speed is not fast enough, the flyback voltage will suffer. Reminder: Vflyback \\= \\-L \\* dI/dt.\n\nThe above can be implemented with:\n\n1. A simple (single) inductor or\n2. A 1:1 coupled inductor.\n\nApparently, from the design equations point of view, there seems to be no need for the 1:1 coupled inductor, as the single inductor will work exactly as well, most probably with less resonance apparatus. However, using a 1:1 coupled inductor will help avoiding EMI generation. I suggest the use the 1:1 coupled inductor in case you have to EMI certify your final product.\n\n\\*\\* However the previous assumptions, should you want to explore the flyback transformer approach, there now exist very nice miniature (micro\\-power) SMD flyback transformers. \\*\\*\n\nFor instance, this Coilcraft model allows up to 1:100 turns ratio with 300Vrms isolation among primary and secondary coils:\n\n[http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235\\.cfm](http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235.cfm)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In designing a flyback circuit to charge a capacitor from 1.5V to 200V with size constraints, which of the following approaches is recommended according to the expert's advice?\n\nA) Use a MOSFET with high Vdss rating as the switch\nB) Implement a step-up converter before the flyback circuit to increase the supply voltage\nC) Utilize a fast-switching high voltage BJT rated at least 200V-300V as the switch\nD) Always use a flyback transformer with a high turns ratio instead of a single inductor\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert recommends using a fast-switching high voltage BJT rated at least 200V-300V as the switch. This is because MOSFETs with sufficiently high Vdss ratings are not readily available for this application, and BJTs can offer higher breakdown voltages. The expert specifically states to \"Rule out the MOSFET and use a fast switching high voltage BJT (rated at least to 200V, better yet to 300V).\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the expert advises against using MOSFETs due to Vdss limitations. \n\nOption B is not recommended as the expert assumes direct use of the 2V DC supply without stepping up the voltage first. \n\nOption D, while mentioned as a possibility, is not always necessary.

While not life-threatening, this condition is expected to last indefinitely and requires ongoing management. Which term best describes this type of illness?\n\nA) Acute\nB) Terminal\nC) Chronic\nD) Intermittent\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nC) Chronic is the correct answer. A chronic illness is defined as a long-lasting condition that persists over an extended period, often for the rest of a person's life. It is not necessarily fatal but requires ongoing management. This aligns with the description of the patient's condition.\n\nA) Acute is incorrect. Acute illnesses are characterized by sudden onset and typically short duration, often coming to a quick resolution or crisis. This doesn't match the long-term nature of the described condition.\n\nB) Terminal is incorrect. While the question states the condition is incurable, it specifically mentions it is not fatal. Terminal illnesses are those expected to lead to death, which doesn't apply in this case.\n\nD) Intermittent is incorrect. While some chronic conditions may have periods of remission and flare-ups, the term \"intermittent\" implies the condition comes and goes completely. The description suggests this condition is persistent, even if its severity might vary.\n\nThe use of \"chronic\" in this context is supported by the Oxford English Dictionary definition and examples provided in the documentation, which describe chronic conditions as \"lasting a long time, long-continued, lingering\" and contrasts them with acute conditions."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/169794", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4331/"], "docs_id": 169794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Globally Unique Identifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier) (GUID) are a grouped string with a specific format which I assume has a security reason.\n\n> A GUID is most commonly written in text as a sequence of hexadecimal\n>  digits separated into five groups, such as:\n> \n> \n> 3F2504E0\\-4F89\\-11D3\\-9A0C\\-0305E82C3301\n\nWhy aren't GUID/UUID strings just random bytes encoded using hexadecimal of X length?\n\n> This text notation contains the following fields, separated by\n>  hyphens:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> | Hex digits | Description\n> |-------------------------\n> | 8            | Data1\n> | 4            | Data2\n> | 4            | Data3\n> | 4            | Initial two bytes from Data4\n> | 12           | Remaining six bytes from Data4\n> \n> ```\n\nThere are also [several versions of the UUID standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).\n\n> Version 4 UUIDs are generally internally stored as a raw array of 128\n>  bits, and typically displayed in a format something like:\n> \n> \n> uuid:xxxxxxxx\\-xxxx\\-4xxx\\-yxxx\\-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From [RfC4122\u00a0\u2013 A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace](http://Tools.IETF.Org/html/rfc4122/)\n\n> The formal definition of the UUID string representation is provided by the following ABNF:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> UUID                   = time-low \"-\" time-mid \"-\"\n>                          time-high-and-version \"-\"\n>                          clock-seq-and-reserved\n>                          clock-seq-low \"-\" node\n> \n> ```\n\nSo, those are just the different fields from the original [time and MAC\\-based UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_1_.28MAC_address.29).

Some examples from the NOW Corpus. I also add in some examples that suggest that whether *tell the truth* is felicitous also depends on whether the speaker has told \"the whole truth\" (e.g., they are not being deceptive through misplaced emphasis):\n\n> We want people to start **telling the truth** as it relates to my client\n>  and what she's been put through  \n> \n>  I believe they are each **telling the truth** as experienced and/or researched.

Without this reformulation of qm and the associated Lagrangian\\-techniques much of QFT would be ridiculous to formulate/calculate.\n\nGeometric quantum mechanics: In this language ones identify all the rays of hilbert space and considers the resulting infinite dimensional manifold (the quantum phase space). By doing this, one can find some 'axioms', which characterize the quantum phase space (these are not axioms in the general meaning; they are more or less properties of the manifold and it is not yet proven, that they define it uniquely). Then one can examine weaker axioms and so extend quantum mechanics in some way. (I think extending a existing theory is the most profound intension behind axiomatization.)\nSee eg [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr\\-qc/9706069](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9706069)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the potential impact of new interpretations or reformulations of quantum mechanics?\n\nA) They primarily aim to make quantum mechanical calculations easier for practical applications.\n\nB) They have no practical value beyond philosophical discussions about the nature of reality.\n\nC) They can provide new mathematical frameworks that enable advancements in related fields like quantum field theory.\n\nD) They are focused solely on resolving paradoxes like the measurement problem without broader implications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: New interpretations or reformulations of quantum mechanics, while not necessarily changing the fundamental predictions, can provide valuable new perspectives and mathematical frameworks. As exemplified by Feynman path integrals, these new formulations can enable significant advancements in related fields like quantum field theory by offering more intuitive or computationally useful ways to approach problems. The geometric quantum mechanics approach shows how reformulations can lead to new \"axioms\" or characterizations that may allow for extensions or generalizations of quantum theory.

Do you know any good site which goes into detail on both latest practical and theoretical development of this interstellar flight?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The link you posted refers to a design which would supposedly make use of *faster than light travel*. After reading this, I immediately stopped reading, since this is not possible. I don't care if it's a NASA\\-affiliated person who says this, it is simply misguided! \n\nBefore continuing, I should draw your attention to the fact that I will *not* be discussing the [Alcubierre drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), a [highly speculative method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive#Difficulties) of achieving very fast space travel which I personally think is more based on wishful thinking than anything else. Instead, I will stick to methods of travel that to not depend on manipulating spacetime in an exotic way.\n\nA different question is whether it might be possible without using faster than light travel, although the answer is almost certainly still no. From [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates) we learn that the closest *possibly* habitable planet would be around 12 light years away. This means that, traveling at $c\\=299792\\.458\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\text{km}}{\\\\text{s}}$ one would take about twelve years to get there. \n\nLet's assume a best\\-case scenario, where this planet turns out to be absolutely perfect \\- with minimal issues pertaining to adjustment to a different atmosphere etc. \\- while we also ignore any logistical issues like building enough spacecrafts to transport a significant number of humans (note that these issues alone will probably already make moving to a different planet an infeasible plan in a realistic scenario!). Let us just focus on the travel time.\n\nFrom some further wikipedia research (notably [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons)) we can conclude that our fastest (unmanned!) spacecrafts currently have a speed around $20\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\text{km}}{\\\\text{s}}$.

This energy goes into two main forms:\n\n1. Heating the exhaust gases as they are expelled from the rocket.\n2. Imparting kinetic energy to the exhaust gases.\n\nThe work is actually being done on the exhaust gases and the surrounding atmosphere. The kinetic energy of the exhaust eventually dissipates through friction with the atmosphere and the ground, ultimately turning into heat. This scenario demonstrates that even when an object appears stationary, energy can still be expended and work can be done on other parts of the system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because energy is being used to produce thrust.\nOption B is partially correct about energy expenditure but fails to recognize the work done on other parts of the system.\nOption C is incorrect because the rocket is not moving, so d = 0 in the work equation for the rocket itself."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/13", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111967", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/161808/"], "docs_id": 111967, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Would it be possible to (or do you think there should be) place a grace period on the reversal / removal of a bounty, and (past the grace period) have a time limit on changing the description for the bounty?\n\n**For example:**\n\nSay I create a quesiton in Flex, and nobody's seen it for a week.

Namely, *if* the assumptions are true (and this is not so uncommon) then it provides a solution that is (on average) more accurate.\n\nMaximum likelihood\n------------------\n\nLeast squares regression and quantile regression (when performed by minimizing the absolute residuals) can be seen as maximizing the likelihood function for Gaussian/Laplace distributed errors, and are in this sense very much related.\n\n* Gaussian distribution:\n\n$$f(x) \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^2}} e^{\\-\\\\frac{(x\\-\\\\mu)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}}$$\n\nwith the log\\-likelihood being maximized when minimizing the sum of squared residuals\n\n$$\\\\log \\\\mathcal{L}(x) \\= \\-\\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\log (2 \\\\pi) \\- n \\\\log(\\\\sigma) \\- \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n (x\\_i\\-\\\\mu)^2}\\_{\\\\text{sum of squared residuals}} $$\n* Laplace distribution:\n\n$$f(x) \\= \\\\frac{1}{2b} e^{\\-\\\\frac{\\\\vert x\\-\\\\mu \\\\vert}{b}}$$\n\nwith the log\\-likelihood being maximized when minimizing the sum of absolute residuals\n\n$$\\\\log \\\\mathcal{L}(x) \\= \\-n \\\\log (2\\) \\- n \\\\log(b) \\- \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n \\|x\\_i\\-\\\\mu\\|}\\_{\\\\text{sum of absolute residuals}} $$\n\nNote: the Laplace distribution and the sum of absolute residuals relates to the median, but it can be generalized to other quantiles by giving different weights to negative and positive residuals.\n\n### Known error distribution\n\nWhen we know the error\\-distribution (when the assumptions are likely true) it makes sense to choose the associated likelihood function. Minimizing that function is more optimal. \n\nVery often the errors are (approximately) normal distributed. In that case using least squares is the best way to find the parameter $\\\\mu$ (which relates to *both* the mean and the median). It is the best way because it has the lowest sample variance (lowest of all *unbiased* estimators). Or you can say more strongly: that it is stochastically dominant (see the illustration in [this question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/386337/are-unbiased-efficient-estimators-stochastically-dominant-over-other-median-un) comparing the distribution of the sample median and the sample mean). \n\n**So, when the errors are normal distributed, then the sample mean is a better estimator of the distribution median than the sample median**. The least squares regression is a more optimal estimator of the quantiles. It is better than using the least sum of absolute residuals. \n\nBecause so many problems deal with normal distributed errors the use of the least squares method is very popular. To work with other type of distributions one can use the [Generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model). And, the method of iterative least squares, which can be used to solve GLMs, also works for the Laplace distribution (ie. [for absolute deviations](http://doi.org/10.2307/2284512)), which is equivalent to finding the median (or in the generalized version other quantiles).\n\nUnknown error distribution\n--------------------------\n\n### Robustness\n\nThe median or other quantiles have the advantage that they are very robust regarding the type of distribution. The actual values do not matter much and the quantiles only care about the order. So no matter what the distribution is, minimizing the absolute residuals (which is equivalent to finding the quantiles) is working very well. \n\nThe question becomes complex and broad here and it is dependent on what type of knowledge we have or do not have about the distribution function. For instance a distribution may be approximately normal distributed but only with some additional outliers. This can be dealt with by removing the outer values. This removal of the extreme values even works in estimating the location parameter of the [Cauchy distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) where the truncated mean can be a better estimator than the median. So not only for the ideal situation when the assumptions hold, but also for some less ideal applications (e.g. additional outliers) there might be good robust methods that still use some form of a sum of squared residuals instead of sum of absolute residuals.\n\nI imagine that regression with truncated residuals might be computationally much more complex. **So it may actually be quantile regression which is the type of regression that is performed because of the reason that it is computationally simpler** (not simpler than ordinary least squares, but simpler than *truncated* least squares). \n\n### Biased/unbiased\n\nAnother issue is biased versus unbiased estimators. In the above I described the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean, ie the least squares solution, as a good or preferable estimator because it often has the lowest variance of all unbiased estimators (when the errors are normal distributed). But, biased estimators may be better (lower expected sum of squared error). \n\nThis makes the question again broad and complex. There are many different estimators and many different situations to apply them. The use of an adapted sum of squared residuals loss function often works well to reduce the error (e.g. all kinds of regularization methods), but it may not need to work well for all cases. Intuitively it is not strange to imagine that, since the sum of squared residuals loss function often works well for all unbiased estimators, the optimal biased estimators is probably something close to a sum of squared residuals loss function."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of linear regression and quantile regression, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Quantile regression always provides more accurate results than linear regression, regardless of the error distribution.\n\nB) Linear regression is computationally simpler than quantile regression, which is its main advantage.\n\nC) When errors are normally distributed, linear regression (least squares method) provides a better estimator of the distribution median than quantile regression.\n\nD) Quantile regression is always preferable because it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When the errors are normally distributed, the least squares method (used in linear regression) provides a more optimal estimator of the quantiles, including the median, than quantile regression. This is because the sample mean (used in linear regression) is a better estimator of the distribution median than the sample median (used in quantile regression) when errors follow a normal distribution.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because linear regression can be more accurate when its assumptions are met, particularly with normally distributed errors.\n\nAnswer B is not the most accurate. While computational simplicity was often cited as an advantage of linear regression, the documentation suggests that quantile regression might actually be computationally simpler in some cases, especially compared to more complex robust regression methods.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it overstates the case for quantile regression.

You've set up color aliases for grep as shown in the documentation. Which of the following statements is true about using these aliases in a pipeline?\n\nA) You can chain multiple color-grep commands to highlight different patterns in various colors within the same match.\n\nB) The color highlighting will persist through multiple grep commands in a pipeline, allowing for nested color highlights.\n\nC) Using color-grep aliases in a pipeline will always result in the last color overriding all previous color highlights.\n\nD) The color-grep aliases can only be used individually, not in a pipeline, to highlight different patterns.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of how grep's color highlighting behaves in pipelines. The correct answer is C because, as explained in the documentation, grep resets the color to normal at the end of each match. In a pipeline, this means that the last grep command's color will override any previous color highlighting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because chaining multiple color-grep commands won't preserve nested color highlights due to the color reset issue.\n\nOption B is false for the same reason - color highlighting doesn't persist through multiple grep commands in a pipeline.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the color-grep aliases can be used in a pipeline, they just won't produce the nested color effect one might expect.\n\nThis question challenges students to understand the limitations of grep's color highlighting in pipelines and how it affects attempts to use multiple colors for different patterns in the same text."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/17", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1764", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/144/"], "docs_id": 1764, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Users are often tempted to break axis values to present data of different orders of magnitude on the same graph (see [here](http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Charts/BrokenYAxis.html)).

The problem is that you have to choose a starting point of the axis, and this is almost always arbitrary. You can choose to make two bars have very different heights, or almost the same height, merely by changing the minimum value on the axis. These three graphs all plot the same data:\n![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzVdD.png)\n\nAn alternative to discontinuous axes, that no one has mentioned yet,is to simply show a table of values. In many cases, tables are easier to understand than graphs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is preparing a presentation on income inequality, comparing the average incomes of CEOs to those of entry-level employees in various industries. The income values differ by several orders of magnitude. Which of the following methods would be the most appropriate and least misleading way to present this data?\n\nA) Use a bar graph with a logarithmic y-axis to show all income levels on one chart\nB) Create a bar graph with a broken y-axis to accommodate the large difference in values\nC) Present the data in a simple table format showing exact income values for each group\nD) Use multiple pie charts to represent the income distribution within each industry\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While logarithmic scales can display data of different magnitudes, they can be misleading in bar graphs as the choice of axis starting point can dramatically alter the visual representation of differences.\nB) Broken y-axes are often discouraged as they can be visually misleading and may exaggerate or understate the actual differences in the data.\nC) A simple table is often the clearest and most accurate way to present data with large magnitude differences. It allows for precise comparison without the risk of visual misinterpretation.\nD) Pie charts are not well-suited for comparing values across different categories and would not effectively show the magnitude of differences between CEO and entry-level incomes.\n\nThe table format (C) provides the most straightforward and least misleading representation of the data, allowing readers to see and compare the exact values without risking misinterpretation due to scale manipulations or visual tricks."}}
