Try printing out your script with:\n\n```\nLC_ALL=c cat -vet starter.sh\n\n```\n\nThis will show any weird (non\\-plain\\-ASCII or nonprinting) characters in the file. If it prints something like:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash$\nSTRING=?M-^@M-^\\this is a test?M-^@M-^]$\necho $STRING$\n\n```\n\n... the \"?M\\-^@M\\-^\\\\\" and \"?M\\-^@M\\-^]\" bits are fancy quotes in UTF\\-8 encoding.

The variable is then used in a script. The Feature class has 200,000 rows and the script takes a very long time to complete. Is there a way to do this quicker? At the moment I think I would just do it by hand rather than write a script due to the length of time it takes.\n\n```py\nimport arcpy\nfc = arcpy.env.workspace = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nXfield = \"XKoordInt\"\ncursor = arcpy.SearchCursor(fc)\nListVal = []\nfor row in cursor:\n    ListVal.append(row.getValue(Xfield))\nvalue = min(ListVal)-20\nprint value\nexpression = \"(!XKoordInt!-{0})/20\".format(value)\narcpy.CalculateField_management (fc, \"Matrix_Z\" ,expression, \"PYTHON\")\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can see several things that may be causing your script to be slow. The thing that is likely being very slow is the `arcpy.CalculateField_management()` function. You should use a cursor, it will by several magnitudes faster. Also, you said you are using ArcGIS Desktop 10\\.3\\.1, but you're using the old ArcGIS 10\\.0 style cursors, which are also much slower.\n\nThe min() operation even on a a list of 200K will be pretty quick. You can verify this by running this small snippet; it happens in the blink of an eye:\n\n```\n>>> min(range(200000)) # will return 0, but is still checking a list of 200,000 values very quickly\n\n```\n\nSee if this is any faster:\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nfc = arcpy.env.workspace = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nXfield = \"XKoordInt\"\nwith arcpy.da.SearchCursor(fc, [Xfield]) as rows:\n    ListVal = [r[0] for r in rows]\n\nvalue = min(ListVal) - 20\nprint value\n\n# now update\nwith arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, [Xfield, 'Matrix_Z']) as rows:\n    for r in rows:\n        if r[0] is not None:\n            r[1] = (r[0] - value) / 20.0\n            rows.updateRow(r)\n\n```\n\nEDIT:\n\nI ran some timing tests and as I suspected, the field calculator took almost twice as long as the new style cursor. Interestingly, the old style cursor was \\~3x slower than the field calculator. I created 200,000 random points and used the same field names.\n\nA decorator function was used to time each function (may be some slight overhead in the setup and tear down of functions, so maybe the [timeit](https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html) module would be a little more accurate to test snippets).\n\nHere are the results:\n\n```\nGetting the values with the old style cursor: 0:00:19.23 \nGetting values with the new style cursor: 0:00:02.50 \nGetting values with the new style cursor + an order by sql statement: 0:00:00.02\n\nAnd the calculations: \n\nfield calculator: 0:00:14.21 \nold style update cursor: 0:00:42.47 \nnew style cursor: 0:00:08.71\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I used (broke everything down to individual functions to use the `timeit` decorator):\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nimport datetime\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef timeit(function):\n    \"\"\"will time a function's execution time\n    Required:\n        function -- full namespace for a function\n    Optional:\n        args -- list of arguments for function\n        kwargs -- keyword arguments for function\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        st = datetime.datetime.now()\n        output = function(*args, **kwargs)\n        elapsed = str(datetime.datetime.now()-st)[:-4]\n        if hasattr(function, 'im_class'):\n            fname = '.'.join([function.im_class.__name__, function.__name__])\n        else:\n            fname = function.__name__\n        print'\"{0}\" from {1} Complete -

As with that list, there should be some rules.\u00a0\n\n1. **The inequality should not be too well known.** This is to rule out things like Cauchy\\-Schwarz or the Sobolev inequalities. The inequality should be unfamiliar to a majority of mathematicians.\n2. **The\u00a0inequality should represent research level mathematics.** This is taken straight from the other list, and feels like a good rule.\n3. **The inequality should be important.**\u00a0\u00a0Since it is easier to come up with inequalities versus exact formulas, this should be more restrictive than in the other list. The idea is to have inequalities which played an important role in the development of some field.\n4. **An answer can be a class of inequalities.** As noted in the comments, often what is important is a family of inequalities which all convey the same idea but where no single result is *the* fundamental example. This is perfectly acceptable, and perhaps even encouraged since any such examples will likely have lots of applications.\n\nTo give an idea of what I mean, let me give an example which I think satisfies the first three criteria; the Li\\-Yau estimate.\n\nThe Li\\-Yau inequality is the estimate $$ \\\\Delta \\\\ln u \\\\geq \\- \\\\frac{\n n}{ 2t}.$$\n\nHere $u: M \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^\\+ $ is a non\\-negative solution to the heat equation\n$ \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\= \\\\Delta u, $ $(M^n,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with non\\-negative Ricci curvature and $\\\\Delta$ is the Laplace\\-Beltrami operator.\n\nThis inequality plays a very important role in geometric analysis. It provides a differential Harnack inequality to solutions to the heat equation, which integrates out to the standard Harnack estimate.\nThere are many results strengthening the original inequality or adapting it to a different setting. There are also results which are not generalizations of the original inequality but which bear its influence.\u00a0For instance, Hamilton proved a tensor version of the Li\\-Yau inequality for a manifold which has non\\-negative sectional curvature and evolves by Ricci flow. Furthermore, one of Perelman's important breakthroughs was to prove a version of the Hamilton\\-Li\\-Yau inequality for a solution to time\\-reversed heat flow when the metric evolves by Ricci flow. These results are not at all corollaries of the original Li\\-Yau estimate, but they are similar in spirit.\u00a0\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The class of [concentration of measure inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure) is a fundamental tool in modern probability (and any field that uses probability, e.g., random matrix theory, theoretical computer science, statistics, high\\-dimensional geometry, combinatorics, etc.). As explained in [this blog post of Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3712), these are basic ways in which one \"upper bounds the probability of something bad\", and often the bounds are exponential or even gaussian in nature when one is far away from the mean (or median) and there are many independent (or somewhat independent) variables involved.

The Summary Statistics tool is built to handle large datasets, and joining the results allows for easy identification of all duplicate instances.\nOption D, while possible, would be less efficient than using ArcGIS's built-in tools for such a large dataset.\n\nThe Summary Statistics approach allows for processing of large datasets efficiently, handles all instances of duplicates correctly, and utilizes existing ArcGIS functionality, making it the best choice for this scenario."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/05", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/414945", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/268974/"], "docs_id": 414945, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I saw this security vulnerability on the Debian website: [https://security\\-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE\\-2017\\-5754](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5754)\n\n```\nstretch (security)  4.9.65-3+deb9u2 fixed\n\n```\n\nI tried to update it using:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n```\n\nThe output was:\n\n```\nPreparing to unpack .../linux-compiler-gcc-6-x86_4.9.65-3+deb9u2_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking linux-compiler-gcc-6-x86 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) over (4.9.65-3+deb9u1) ...\nPreparing to unpack .../linux-kbuild-4.9_4.9.65-3+deb9u2_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking linux-kbuild-4.9 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) over (4.9.65-3+deb9u1) ...\nPreparing to unpack .../linux-libc-dev_4.9.65-3+deb9u2_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking linux-libc-dev:amd64 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) over (4.9.65-3+deb9u1) ...\nSetting up linux-libc-dev:amd64 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) ...\nSetting up linux-compiler-gcc-6-x86 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) ...\nSetting up linux-kbuild-4.9 (4.9.65-3+deb9u2) ...\n\n```\n\nThe output for `uname -a` is:\n\n```\n4.9.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.65-3+deb9u1 (2017-12-23) x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n```\n\nThe output when I used `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` was `4.9.65-3+deb9u2`, but in `uname -a` it's `4.9.65-3+deb9u1`.

After the first concave lens, the ray should diverge instead of converge.\n\nThere are few disadvantage of using lens to create such large angle. (1\\) The angular resolution decrease, assuming the projector are of the same distance from the screen. (2\\) The brightness decrease by the same factor. (3\\) To obtaining such large angle using lens will cause severe [dispersion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_%28optics%29), that is the color of each pixel now spreading out and might overlap with other pixel. (4\\) The image at the edges would be distorted by most lens.\n\nThe brightness is usually adjustable, but not the angular resolution. But your aim seems to be have a larger image in a screen so it is not a problem whatever scheme you are using. So the (3\\) and (4\\) are the problems caused by using lens.\n\nIf you want a large image, my suggestion is to simply move your projector further away from the screen.

GeoDjango takes this a step further and provides you a way to easily view and edit geospatial data using an Openlayers map.\n* GeoRSS/GeoAtom feeds: Creating GeoRSS/GeoAtom feeds is relatively easy.\n* KML/GML/GeoJSON support: GeoDjango supports KML, GML, and GeoJSON serialization.

Also, you have access to a wide variety of Python libraries. As an example, there is a project called Haystack that provides full\\-text search capability. If you are using an external search index like Solr or Elasticsearch, you can use Django to do geospatially enabled full\\-text searches. Personally, Elasticsearch is a great replacement for PostGIS for spatial searches.

That is, a vector is defined as a certain representation of the rotation group.\n\nThat said, however, the use of the term vector clearly is just a matter of convention. Why vectors in nonrelativistic and relativistic physics are treated differently is to some extent a matter of sociology, but there can also be more concrete reasons for doing so.\n\nFirst, the philosophy whereby physical laws are derived from their symmetries, and not vice versa, was historically only introduced along with relativity, hence the focus on manifest Lorentz invariance in relativity. Second, it is a mathematical fact that the classification of representations of the Galilei group is much more tricky than the same problem for the Lorentz group (the reason being that the Galilei group is not semisimple). See for instance [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/39/29/026): the Galilei group has not only 3\\-vectors, but also two different types of 4\\-vectors, and 5\\-vectors, among others. The construction of invariants for a given representation is likewise a nontrivial task. I believe this is the main practical reason why representations of the Galilei group and their use are much less frequently discussed than those of the Lorentz group.\n\nTo answer the original question, velocity is a vector under rotations.

In non-relativistic physics, the term \"vector\" typically refers to how a quantity transforms under spatial rotations, not necessarily under all Galilean transformations. Both force and velocity transform as 3-vectors under rotations, which is sufficient to classify them as vectors in this context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because force and velocity do not transform identically under boosts. Force transforms trivially under boosts, while velocity does not.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the definition of a vector in non-relativistic physics is primarily based on rotational properties, not boost properties. Velocity's non-trivial transformation under boosts doesn't disqualify it from being a vector.\n\nOption C is partially correct but overstates the case. While force does transform trivially under all Galilean transformations, making it a \"true\" 3-vector in this sense, the classification of velocity as part of a 5-vector is a more advanced concept not typically used in basic non-relativistic physics. Additionally, both are still considered 3-vectors based on their rotational properties.\n\nThe key point is that in non-relativistic physics, the vector nature of quantities is typically defined by their behavior under rotations, which both force and velocity satisfy."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/29", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/59438", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/22566/"], "docs_id": 59438, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a Mechanical Engineering student and I'm working on my senior project, so I need help.

What I'm struggling to know is: How to calculate the Power at the focal point?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The upper bound is easy. The [solar constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant) through the atmosphere is about $970W \\\\over m^2$ so you're gathering at most $\\\\pi\\\\cdot((0\\.75m)^2 \\\\cdot 970W / m^2 \\= 1\\.7kW$ \n\nIf your focal point is perfect (it isn't) then you'd have infinite [power density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density).\n\nYou will need to measure the actual power produced (and therefor the efficiency) because it depends on a lot of factors like the reflectivity of the coper and so forth.\n\n*Edit: [fixed solar constant to account for atmospheric absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_%28solar_energy%29)*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A solar dish with a diameter of 1.5 meters and a focal length of 60cm is being designed for a senior engineering project.

Given that the solar constant through the atmosphere is approximately 970 W/m\u00b2, calculate the maximum theoretical power that could be collected by this dish. Then, determine which of the following statements is correct regarding the power at the focal point.\n\nA) The maximum theoretical power collected is 1.7 kW, and the power density at the focal point will be infinite if the focus is perfect.\n\nB) The maximum theoretical power collected is 2.3 kW, and the power density at the focal point will always be finite due to material limitations.\n\nC) The maximum theoretical power collected is 1.7 kW, and the actual power at the focal point can be precisely calculated without experimental measurements.\n\nD) The maximum theoretical power collected is 2.3 kW, and the power density at the focal point will be exactly equal to the solar constant.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe maximum theoretical power collected can be calculated using the formula:\nPower = \u03c0 * (diameter/2)\u00b2 * solar constant\nPower = \u03c0 * (1.5m/2)\u00b2 * 970 W/m\u00b2 \u2248 1.7 kW\n\nThis matches the value given in option A. Additionally, in a theoretically perfect focal point, the power density would approach infinity as the area approaches zero. However, in reality, this is impossible due to various factors such as material imperfections and the physical limits of energy concentration.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the calculated power is wrong, and while the power density will indeed be finite in reality, a perfect focus would theoretically yield infinite density.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the maximum theoretical power is correct, the actual power at the focal point depends on various factors like reflectivity and cannot be precisely calculated without experimental measurements.\n\nOption D is incorrect on both counts - the calculated power is wrong, and the power density at the focal point would be much higher than the solar constant due to the concentration effect of the dish."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/13", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/700849", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/222517/"], "docs_id": 700849, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My audio is routed through a second device (default), which then feeds to the primary.

It doesn't really have anything to do with whether the model is nonlinear or if you use a mixed model. The easiest way to get your model returned fitted with level means coding instead of reference level coding is to suppress the intercept when you have a factor variable. In R, this can be done with either `+0` or `-1`. Consider: \n\n```\nset.seed(123)                 # this makes the example exactly reproducible\nx = runif(30, min=0, max=10)  # x is a continuous variable\ng = as.factor(sample(rep(c(\"C\",\"T\"), 15), 30, replace=F))  # g is categorical\ny = 3 + .3*x + 2*ifelse(g==\"T\",1,0) + rnorm(30)            \n\n## this is the typical way, which uses reference level coding:  \nmod.refL = lm(y~x+g)\nsummary(mod.refL)\n# ...\n# Coefficients:\n#             Estimate Std.

It gives it the aura of a parent, a teacher, a policeman, a pastor, or governor, which is odd. At the same time, it's understandable: as the ulcer becomes stronger, it exerts more control over the man and his life.\n\nThe man's authority didn't necessarily grow: the *ulcer's* power over his life did.\n\n> ...over the years of his career as an interpreter of America to provincial and ignorant notables from backwaters of civilization.\n\nThis section has nothing to do with the authority, except by ironic contrast. \n\n...*of his career*... modifies the *years* and, given the timing, indirectly states that his ulcer is due to his career.\n\n...*as an interpreter*... modifies the *career* and explains what it is. \n\nYou seem to be taking it literally, though, and ...*an interpreter of America*... is obviously not a translator of languages but a tour guide, cultural professor, \\&c. who metaphorically acts as an interpreter.\n\n...*to provincial and ignorant notables from backwaters of civilization* explains to whom he is interpreting America. On the surface, it's a very jingoistic way to phrase it that may make the author seem to be very pro\\-American. In fact, given (a) that this is Vonnegut, (b) the content of the rest of this book, and (c) the content of the rest of this sentence (the man's job is so unhealthy as to have taken control of his life via his ulcer), it is unquestionably ironic and anti\\-American.

This API will be used internally to perform some server side actions that were triggered by AJAX calls.\n\nTo make things easier for me, I thought of using the Chain\\-of\\-Command/Responsibility pattern.\n\nHere are more details about what I want to do: \n\nI am creating a \"dashboard\" where admins of my app will be able to update information (meta data) about items stored in a database. \n\nTo make things easy and simple for the admins, I chose to use AJAX. So, if an admin wants to delete an item, (s)he clicks on the \"delete button\". A POST request is then sent to `edit.php` page with all the information needed to perform the deletion (action : delete, element : link, id : xx ...). Where `action`, `element` and of course `id` can change. \n\nThis is why I opted for a mini\\-API that will, depending on the `action` and the `element` data, call a different function from a different class. \n\nNow, to implement the API, I decided to use Chain\\-of\\-Responsibility design pattern. Why? Because I can easily add, delete or update classes without having to modify the API itself. \n\nIs the Chain of Responsibility design pattern good fit for my case? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The idea of the chain\\-of\\-command pattern is to build a chain of handlers and pass a command along this chain until one of the handlers handles the command. This behavior is typically found in event processing, where, say, a click event from a UI button bubbles up the hierarchy of UI elements till it reaches an element that has a respective handler attached. This handler can then decided whether it handles the command \\-\\- effectively ending the event processing \\-\\- or not \\-\\- in which case the event is propagated further along the chain.\n\nLet's now assume we use that pattern for you web API. What you describe sounds like a classical [CRUD(L)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) interface to me, where your actions are (a subset of) create, read, update, and delete. You say you have delete requests and I'm assume that you want some kind of update requests, too. Let's assume further that you wrote respective handlers **hupd** and **hdel** for these kinds requests. Following the chain\\-of\\-command pattern, you then build the chain **\\[hupd,hdel]** to handle requests to your API. What happens is that every update request passed into the chain gets immediately handled by **hupd**, while every delete request is rejected by **hupd** and passed along to **hdel**, which handles it. This behavior shows a fixed mapping between actions and handlers that actually makes the chain unnecessary. (In fact, the chain even lowers your system's performance, because of the check and the passing along of every delete request). Why does this happen? Because there are no two handlers responsible for different subsets of requests with the same action type. What you really want to have here is a direct mapping **\\[\"update\" \\=\\> hupd, \"delete\" \\=\\> hdel]** and a dispatcher that takes respective requests and passes them directly to the respective handler. Such a design can still be extendible with regard to new actions, if there is a dynamic registry holding the mapping.\n\nNow you could say, that you want to have different handlers for, say, the deletion of elements of type A and B. What gives you handlers for subsets of requests with the same action type. But once again, you have a direct and fixed mapping between the handlers and the element type, i.e., you can repeatedly dispatch requests based on the target element type. This gives you a two\\-level dispatch, where with a chain\\-of\\-command you would pass the request through number\\-of\\-actions times number\\-of\\-element\\-types handlers, in the worst case.\n\n*Conclusion:* I would not recommend the chain\\-of\\-command pattern to implement this kind of API.

In this case, there's likely a direct mapping between actions (like update, delete) and their respective handlers. Using a chain would mean that every request would need to be passed through multiple handlers until it reaches the correct one, even when there's a clear, direct relationship between the action and its handler.

The ground wire leading to the switch was raw copper without any insulation.\n\nAfter replacing the switch, and turning on the circuit breaker, the breaker sparked and tripped. I'm thinking one of two things explain why:\n\n1. The new FEIT switch was defective (which would be my 4th defective switch from the big carton of FEIT switches I bought).\n2. The naked ground wire touched the contacts of the other switch in the box.\n\nI turned off the breaker, put it a completely different switch, and did my best to get that naked ground wire as far away as possible from the other switch. Then I flipped the breaker on (shielding my eyes, and standing away from the breaker box), and everything worked.\n\nSo my question: Why are ground wires sometimes installed without any insulation?

NM, because it's made in large quantities, uses a bare grounding wire to save cost (likewise with UF and most SE cables, as those pennies add up at industrial scales). On the other hand, if your house is wired using armored cable (AC), there are no ground wires, because the metal cable armor serves as the ground with the aid of a thin \"bonding strip\" to prevent \"choking\" of fault currents caused by stray inductive interactions. That lack of grounding wires is also a notable feature of many installs done in metal conduit, as the *conduit itself* then becomes the grounding conductor.\n\nFurthermore, some wiring methods aren't uniform in how they handle this; it's legal (and occasionally required) to run a separate equipment grounding conductor in metal conduit, and in most (albeit not all!) cases, equipment grounding conductors inside conduits can be either bare or insulated. Likewise, metal\\-clad cable usually uses an insulated grounding conductor, but can sometimes be found with a bare grounding conductor, or in configurations where the armor is the grounding means."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In residential electrical wiring, which of the following statements about grounding conductors is most accurate?\n\nA) Grounding conductors are always insulated to prevent accidental contact with other wires.\nB) The use of bare copper grounding wires in NM (non-metallic) cable is primarily driven by aesthetic considerations.\nC) Armored cable (AC) uses a separate insulated grounding wire for enhanced safety.\nD) The choice between bare and insulated grounding conductors can vary depending on the wiring method used.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation indicates that the use of bare or insulated grounding conductors depends on the wiring method employed. For example, NM cable typically uses bare grounding wires to reduce costs, while metal-clad cable often uses insulated grounding conductors. In some cases, like with armored cable (AC), the metal armor itself serves as the grounding means. The choice between bare and insulated grounding conductors is not uniform across all wiring methods and can be influenced by factors such as cost, specific requirements, and the physical characteristics of the wiring system."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/17", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4065019", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/901436/"], "docs_id": 4065019, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If there are two nonlinear systems with stable equilibria $x\\_1 \\= x\\_2 \\= 0$\n$$\\\\dot x\\_1 \\= f(x\\_1, u) \\\\qquad \\\\dot x\\_2 \\= g(x\\_2, u)$$\nwith identical inputs $u$, is the difference between the system states $x\\_1, x\\_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n$\n$$e \\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2$$\nstable?\n\nTrivial case\n------------\n\nIf the systems are LTI with identical system and input matrices $A$ and $B$\n$$f(x\\_1 \\= x, u) \\= g(x\\_2 \\= x, u) \\= Ax \\+ Bu,$$\nthe system dynamics is\n$$\\\\dot e \\= Ae.$$\nA Lyapunov function\n$$V(e) \\= e^T P e$$\nresults in\n$$\\\\dot V(e) \\= \\\\dot e P e^T \\+ e^T P \\\\dot e \\= e^T (A^T P \\+ P A) e.$$\nIf $A$ is Hurwitz, then $A^T P \\+ P A \\= \\-Q$ with a positive definite real symmetric $P$ and a positive definite $Q$.

That is you are considering that you can make the error asymptotically stable with the appropriate choice of $u.$ My interpretation of your question is:\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two IO stable systems IO stable? (Where IO Stable can mean whatever type of stability you want it to mean)\n\nFor all practical purposes this is what you are asking since we can always absorb a sign into one of the system's outputs and ask that question for $e' \\= y\\_1 \\+ y\\_2\\.$ Now, this is still not obviously true. For example, Arastas' combined system is not controllable. In particular, note that the stacked system is\n\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\dot{x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\&\\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\-1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} {x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ {x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\ \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix} u, \\\\\\\\ y \\&\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the Kalman Controllability Conditions and verify a lack of controllability. However, it is stabilizable! The eigenvalues of the system matrix remain negative. In fact, this is true for any stacked systems that are otherwise **decoupled**. The eigenvalues of the combined system are necessarily the union of eigenvalues. So if you have two systems whose system matrix is Hurwitz, then the stacked state also has a Hurwitz system matrix. Moreover, if both systems are controllable, you at the minimum have stabilizability. And, of course, if all the states decay, clearly the output $y :\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2 \\\\to 0$ as well.\n\nOf course, by stacking the system, it should be made clear that the feedback used to stabilize the system *may be different* than the feedback used to stabilize the individual subsystems. As does the nature of the stability. That shouldn't be surprising. However, my interpretation of your question is that $u$ is the same in both, but not a\\-priori fixed. So under that interpretation this is reasonable.\n\nNow, what about in the nonlinear case. Clearly, even in the linear case, you are going to lose modes of controllability and so that is likely to highly constrain the nonlinear case (and being nonlinear the problem gets harder). First off, recognize that if both systems can be linearized, have Hurwitz jacobians and are controllable we can just defer to the above result. So let us consider the other cases. This is where it gets tricky. One place to look is passivity and that is not a bad place to look since you are already considering Lyapunov stability. Assuming you absorb a sign in the right place and prove that the sign flipped system is passive (i.e. you proved the map $u\\_2\\\\mapsto \\-y\\_2$ is passive) you can consider\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two passive systems, passive?\n\nAlways. Once the combined system is passive, you can stabilize it with a strictly passive feedback to get $L\\_2$ stability ($L\\_2$ inputs produce $L\\_2$ outputs).\n\nYou can also consider feedback interconnections and cleverly organize your inputs and outputs to get some input to the error is passive probably. However all of these considerations depend highly on the system you are considering as they are quite restrictive! There are a wide variety of tools available that, once you have determined a system and specific category of stability, could be leveraged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider two nonlinear systems with stable equilibria at x1 = x2 = 0:\n\n\u1e8b1 = f(x1, u)\n\u1e8b2 = g(x2, u)\n\nWhere u is an identical input to both systems.

The problem is that `statusBar` does not register the events of `Hooks.manageDocks` properly. Once `xmonad` is running all works well because `manageDocks` is able to update the `Struts` on every window event. But in the moment that `xmonad` is starting the event of making the first windows fullscreen happens before the events from `manageDocks`. This mages that first open window to ignore the existence of `xmobar`.\n\n`manageDocks` has its event handler that **must** be set as the last event handler, therefore `statusBar` cannot be used. Instead, it is necessary to make `xmonad` call and configure `xmobar` manually through `dynamicLog`, `manageHook`, `layoutHook` and `handleEventHook`. A minimalistic configuration for this would be:\n\n```\nmain = do\n    xmproc <- spawnPipe \"xmobar\"\n    xmonad $ defaultConfig\n      { modMask            = mod4Mask\n      , manageHook         = manageDocks <+> manageHook defaultConfig\n      , layoutHook         = avoidStruts  $ layoutHook defaultConfig\n      -- this must be in this order, docksEventHook must be last\n      , handleEventHook    = handleEventHook defaultConfig <+> docksEventHook\n      , logHook            = dynamicLogWithPP xmobarPP\n          { ppOutput          = hPutStrLn xmproc\n          , ppTitle           = xmobarColor \"darkgreen\"  \"\" . shorten 20\n          , ppHiddenNoWindows = xmobarColor \"grey\" \"\"\n          }\n      , startupHook        = setWMName \"LG3D\"\n      } `additionalKeys`\n      [ ((mod4Mask, xK_b), sendMessage ToggleStruts) ]\n\n```\n\nThis makes all events to be processed by `docsEventHook` and ensures that layout changes made by `docsEventHook` are the last ones applied.

This interpretation aligns with the explanation provided in the StackExchange answer, which states that the phrase can refer to \"the end of any given period of time in this context.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because while it could be a literal interpretation, it's less common in this type of context. \nOption C is incorrect as it assumes a literal day-long timeframe, which is unlikely given the nature of political endeavors. \nOption D is incorrect because the phrase doesn't imply suddenness or unexpectedness, but rather a final outcome after a period of effort.\n\nThe correct interpretation (B) allows for the metaphorical condensing of a longer time period into the concept of a \"day,\" similar to how the Riddle of the Sphinx uses a day to represent a human lifetime."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/07", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/343606", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/252421/"], "docs_id": 343606, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\npublic class TaskA implements Runnable {\n....\n}\npublic class TaskB implements Runnable {\n....\n}\n\n```\n\nI have two runnable class as TaskA, TaskB.

I am a big fan of the open\\-source concept \\- especially in research, where transparency and reproducibility is already a big part of the culture. I gladly contribute as much as I can to the community, and releasing my code for anyone to use is part of that.\n\nHowever, in research there is always a certain measure of uncertainty about what the stuff you produce will be used for. I fully understand that I can't copyright any results or conclusions \\- but I can protect how others use my code, and I would like to make sure that there is no (legal) way to incorporate software I produce in military applications.\n\nI've read through a few of the shorter ones of the common OSS licenses, and summaries of some more, but they all seem to focus solely on the questions \"do you earn money on my code?\" and \"do you make my code available with your program?\" \\- nothing about what the program actually does with the code.\n\nAre there any good open\\-source licenses that explicitly prohibit all kinds of military applications?\n\n### Update:\n\nAfter reading up some more on how OSS works, I've realized that a license that meets my needs by definition will not be open\\-source, since open\\-source licenses cannot discriminate against fields. Thus, I'm rather looking for a license that is *like* an open\\-source license, except that it prohibits military use. I want this license to be already existing, authored or at least reviewed by someone who actually knows licensing, since I don't.\n\nAlso, in response to a couple of remarks that this will be difficult to enforce: yes, I realize that. But this is more for myself than for the legal implications; if I use a license like this, and a military organization uses my code anyway, they are breaking the law and they are doing it despite my explicit instructions not to. Thus, the potentially gruesome things that they do with applications that include software I've written are no longer \"on my conciousness\", since they stole the software from me. (And somewhere I have a na\u00efve hope that if they need something I've done, and my license prohibits them from using it legally, they'll get someone elses program that does the same thing and allows them to use it. Not that governments always do, but they always *should* abide by the law...)\n\nIt's a moral safeguard, so to speak, rather than something I actually expect to bring up in court (if my mediocre code is ever used by CIA...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How would one enforce such a license?\n\nWould you prohibit *any* military use? If the software checks air pressure in tires, and someone decides to use it on a military Hummer, is that a prohibited use? Can people in the military industrial complex use it to plan their monthly picnic?\n\nWould it be an acceptable use if the software improved ballistic missile trajectories, and the improved accuracy of the weapon prevented civilians from being killed? Or would any use in a weapon be prohibited?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions you have to ask yourself, if you want to make a software license that satisfies your sensibilities.\n\nNevertheless, I'd try an keep it simple. [Yahoo's Terms of Use](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/desktopsearch/desktopsearch-300.html) state that their software must not be used \n\n> *\"to operate nuclear facilities, life support or other mission critical applications where human life or property may be at stake.\"*\n\nThat's probably as good a clause as any, if you add the word \"weapons\" to the prohibited list of uses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher wants to create an open-source license for their software that prohibits military applications.

Open-source licenses, by definition, cannot discriminate against fields of endeavor, including military applications.\n2. The researcher realized that a license meeting their needs would not be considered open-source.\n3. They are looking for a license that is similar to open-source but prohibits military use.\n4.

The sum S is related to the m-th powers of the imaginary parts of the n-th roots of -1. These can be expressed as polynomials in elementary symmetric functions of the imaginary parts. This is because the n-th roots of -1 satisfy the equation (x+iy)^n + 1 = 0, and by eliminating x, we can obtain a polynomial in y (the imaginary part) whose roots are the imaginary parts of the n-th roots of -1. The sum S can then be expressed in terms of these elementary symmetric functions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sum typically results in an algebraic expression, not a transcendental function. Option B is incorrect because the sum is related to the imaginary parts, not the real parts, of the n-th roots of -1. Option D is incorrect because for odd m and real arguments (\u03c0k/n), sin^m(\u03c0k/n) is always real, so the sum S is also real."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/18", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/214682", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/13965/"], "docs_id": 214682, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\nfrom shapely.geometry import MultiLineString\ncoords = [((0, 0), (3, 3)), ((-1, 0), (1, 0))]\nlines = MultiLineString(coords)\npt1 = lines.interpolate(1)\npt2 = lines.interpolate(2)\n\n```\n\nHow would I find the distance, along the line, between these two points?

Two points are interpolated on this MultiLineString: pt1 at distance 0.5 and pt2 at distance 1.5. Which of the following statements is correct about these interpolated points?\n\nA) pt1 and pt2 will be on different line segments of the MultiLineString\nB) The Euclidean distance between pt1 and pt2 will be exactly 1.0\nC) pt1 and pt2 will both be located on the line segment from (0,0) to (3,3)\nD) The distance along the MultiLineString between pt1 and pt2 will be less than 1.0\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nWhen using the interpolate() method on a MultiLineString, it only considers the first line segment in the collection. In this case, both pt1 and pt2 will be interpolated along the line segment from (0,0) to (3,3), ignoring the second line segment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because both points will be on the same line segment.\nOption B is incorrect because the Euclidean distance between the points will be 1.0 only if measured along the line, not as a straight line between them.\nOption C is correct as explained above.\nOption D is incorrect because the distance along the line between pt1 and pt2 will be exactly 1.0 (from 0.5 to 1.5 on the first line segment)."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/67022", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 67022, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know it's for the linux program patch, but if I try to use it, I get the following error:\n\nmissing header for unified diff at line 4 of patch\n\nmalformed patch at line 5: quit\n\nInstead, I'd like to just cut out the middleman and edit it by hand, but I don't know what any of the symbols mean.\n\n```\na/com.ibm.celldt.simulator.profile.default_3.1.0.200809010950/simulator_init.tcl\n\n+ b/com.ibm.celldt.simulator.profile.default_3.1.0.200809010950/simulator_init.tcl\n@@ -701,9 +701,9 @@ proc CellDT_ShutdownComplete { args } {\nquit\n}\n\n-mysim trigger set console \"The system is going down for system halt NOW!\" CellDT_ShutdownNotified\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: Switching to runlevel: 0\" CellDT_ShutdownStarted\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel\" CellDT_ShutdownComplete\n+mysim trigger set console \"init: rcS main\" CellDT_ShutdownNotified\n+mysim trigger set console \"Sending all processes the TERM signal\" CellDT_ShutdownStarted\n+mysim trigger set console \"md: stopping all md devices.\" CellDT_ShutdownComplete\n\nproc writeConsole { t } {\nmysim console create console_id in string $t\n@@ -740,8 +740,8 @@ proc CellDT_BootNearlyReady { args } {\n}\n\nmysim trigger set console \"Starting Linux\" CellDT_BootedBios\n-mysim trigger set console \"Welcome to Fedora Core\" CellDT_BootedLinux\n-mysim trigger set console \"INIT: Entering runlevel: 2\" CellDT_BootNearlyReady\n+mysim trigger set console \"Welcome to Fedora\" CellDT_BootedLinux\n+mysim trigger set console \"Starting login process\" CellDT_BootNearlyReady\n\n# # CONFIGURATION:\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Unified diff format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format): basically '\\-' means removed line, '\\+' means added line.

This approach prevents the accumulation of warnings over time, which can lead to important issues being overlooked amidst numerous trivial warnings. By dealing with warnings promptly, developers maintain a clean codebase and ensure that new, potentially critical warnings are easily noticeable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ignoring all warnings can lead to overlooking serious issues. Option B is problematic as it relies on subjective judgment and may allow less obvious but still important warnings to persist. Option C is a poor practice as it eliminates the benefit of having warnings altogether, potentially hiding important issues.\n\nThe correct answer, D, aligns with the advice given in the documentation. It suggests addressing all warnings immediately, which includes the possibility of disabling specific rules if they are deemed irrelevant to the project context.

However, the system fails to boot properly when this new drive is connected, asking for the root password and then displaying an error message stating \"file system ext3.fsck not found.\" What is the most likely cause of this issue and how should it be resolved?\n\nA) The new drive is not properly formatted. The administrator should reformat the drive using the mkfs.ext3 command.\n\nB) The /etc/fstab file is misconfigured. The administrator should check and correct the file system type specified for the new drive in /etc/fstab.\n\nC) The ext3 file system module is not loaded. The administrator should add ext3 to /etc/modules to load it at boot time.\n\nD) The new drive has bad sectors. The administrator should run fsck on the drive to repair the file system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is a misconfiguration in the /etc/fstab file. The error message suggests that the system is looking for an \"ext3.fsck\" file, which is not a standard Linux component. This implies that the file system type may be incorrectly specified in /etc/fstab.\n\nThe correct approach is to check the /etc/fstab file and ensure that the entry for the new drive correctly specifies \"ext3\" as the file system type, not \"ext3.fsck\" or any other incorrect value. The line should look similar to:\n\n/dev/sdXX   /<mount point>    ext3   defaults    0  0\n\nWhere sdXX is the device identifier for the new drive, and <mount point> is where it should be mounted.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are less likely to be the cause of this specific error message, although they could be potential issues in other scenarios."}}
