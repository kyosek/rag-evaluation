Changing area codes manually can cause conflicts and is not recommended. The error message \"Area code is already set\" indicates this is not the proper way to handle cross-area functionality.\n\nB) While it's possible to access order data directly from the session, it's not the most modular or extensible approach.

Magento provides the 'checkout_onepage_controller_success_action' event specifically for this purpose. By creating an observer for this event, you can cleanly extend the functionality without modifying core code or risking conflicts with other modules.\n\nD) Modifying core Magento classes is never recommended as it can lead to upgrade issues and conflicts with other modules.

I know it is a poorly written headline, but which way is the more common way to read it? (In other words, is it likely that no\\-one at the newspaper noticed the ambiguity?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a type of ambiguous headline known as a *[crash blossom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_blossom#In_headlines)*. From the Wikipedia link:\n\n> Newspaper headlines are written in a telegraphic style (headlinese) which often omits the copula and therefore lends itself to syntactic ambiguity, usually of the garden path type. The name 'crash blossoms' was proposed for these ambiguous headlines by Dan Bloom and Mike O'Connell in the Testy Copy Editors discussion group in August 2009 based on a headline \"**Violinist linked to JAL crash blossoms**\".\\[3] The Columbia Journalism Review regularly reprints such headlines in its \"The Lower case\" column, and has collected them in the anthologies **Squad helps dog bite victim**\\[4] and **Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge**.\\[5]\n\nOne of my favorites from the list there is\n\n> **The British left waffles on Falklands** (Did the British leave waffles behind, or was there waffling by the British Left?)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the linguistic phenomenon exemplified by the headline \"Gadhafi forces retreat\"?\n\nA) Dangling modifier\nB) Crash blossom\nC) Spoonerism\nD) Malapropism\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe headline \"Gadhafi forces retreat\" is an example of a crash blossom, which is a type of ambiguous headline that can be interpreted in multiple ways due to its telegraphic style. In this case, \"forces\" can be read as either a noun or a verb, leading to two possible interpretations:\n\n1. Gadhafi's forces (noun) are retreating\n2. Gadhafi forces (verb) someone or something to retreat\n\nThis ambiguity is characteristic of crash blossoms, which often arise from the omission of articles, prepositions, or other grammatical elements in headline writing. The term \"crash blossom\" itself comes from a similarly ambiguous headline: \"Violinist linked to JAL crash blossoms.\"\n\nOption A (Dangling modifier) is incorrect because the ambiguity doesn't stem from a misplaced modifying phrase.\nOption C (Spoonerism) is incorrect as it refers to the transposition of initial sounds in a phrase, which is not present here.\nOption D (Malapropism) is incorrect because it involves the mistaken use of a word in place of a similar-sounding one, which is not the case in this headline."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/10/01", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/49412", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/12894/"], "docs_id": 49412, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'd like to swap the `Fn` and `Ctrl` keys on my ThinkPad W500 (like many others!

Numerous folks indicate that Windows doesn't register the `Fn` key as a keypress but using [Mihov ASCII Master 2\\.0](http://www.mihov.com/eng/am.html), that gives the ASCII value of a keypress, I see the Fn key returning FF (perhaps FF in this case means 'not registered'). I also see that keys like `Ctrl` register with one ASCII code when pressed alone and another when pressed in combo with another key. `Fn` will only register when pressed alone, so Windows definitely isn't seeing the combo. This took a solution like AutoHotKey off the table.\n2. I ran [KeyTweak](http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/) (which shows you the hardware scan codes of a keypress and the `Fn` key registerd as 57443\\). Using this program I remapped `Fn` to the `Ctrl` key; this worked perfectly. However, I suspect that because of the issue in \\#1, the combo of, for example, `Fn` \\+ `C` did *not* execute a copy.\n\nShort of retraining my pinky I'm actually considering removing the keyboard and resoldering the connections to swap those keys.\n\nI'd love to get some input as to the root technical issue(s) and possible solutions here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Apparently the FN key is not handled by the Windows keyboard driver, but rather by drivers developed by Lenovo. Hence remapping of the FN key is impossible by any Windows utility that switches keys, because the Fn key doesn't generate any scan\\-codes.\n\nApparently Lenovo is currently considering a modification to the BIOS that will make this possible. See this article: [\"Switch Mode for Fn/Ctrl Keys\"](http://blog.lenovo.com/design/switch-mode-for-fn-ctrl-keys-follow-up).\n\nIn conclusion you should (1\\) regard your BIOS to see if such an option already exists, and if not (2\\) check the Lenovo site for BIOS upgrades from time to time (just note that BIOS upgrades need to be done very very carefully, since a mistake means bricking your computer).\n\nIn the meantime, you can use this solution (just joking):\n\n![image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mDOBO.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user wants to swap the Fn and Ctrl keys on their ThinkPad W500 laptop.

The documentation indicates that the Fn key is handled by Lenovo-specific drivers rather than the standard Windows keyboard driver. This means it doesn't generate typical scan codes that can be easily intercepted or modified by standard Windows keyboard remapping utilities. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation specifically mentions that AutoHotKey is not a viable solution due to how the Fn key is handled.\n\nOption B is misleading. While the Fn key may register as FF in some utilities, this likely indicates that it's not being registered as a standard keypress, rather than being a usable ASCII code.\n\nOption D is too extreme. While physically modifying the keyboard was considered by the user, it's not the only potential solution. The documentation mentions that Lenovo was considering a BIOS modification to allow this remapping, suggesting that software solutions may be possible in the future.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the core issue: the unique handling of the Fn key by Lenovo-specific drivers, which explains why typical remapping methods don't work and points towards why manufacturer-specific solutions (like potential BIOS updates) might be necessary."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/09", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/18009", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/5818/"], "docs_id": 18009, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes, Steam puts contradictory information on when exactly a game will become available (and/or unlocked).\n\nFor example, right now, Dragon Age 2 is reported to become available on March 10th, 2011 \u2014 that's roughly an hour.

The documentation mentions that one advantage of using text editors like Vim or Emacs is the ability to \"run a debugger on a remote machine two firewalls away (via ssh), or on a tiny embedded system.\" This flexibility for remote debugging can be particularly useful in low-level programming scenarios.\n\nOption A is incorrect because IDEs typically have more advanced built-in debugging tools compared to text editors.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the documentation actually states that superior source code handling, including navigation and refactoring, is a strong point of IDEs, not text editors.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while text editors can work with various build systems, the documentation doesn't suggest they are inherently better than those integrated into IDEs.\n\nThe question tests the understanding of the trade-offs between IDEs and text editors, particularly in the context of low-level programming and remote debugging capabilities."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/17", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/293106", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/109251/"], "docs_id": 293106, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am doing research on the protected areas of the Amazon rainforest and I need to create a single polygon layer that has all the forested non\\-protected areas in one attribute row.

You also need to be careful in how you describe it because you can only make inferences about the performance of the individual subject and not subjects in general.\n\nIf you're analyzing multiple subjects then you need to actually have paired data, which means aggregating across subjects to comparable paired measures, such as how many cookies/day or mean cookies/hr. You're not allowed to have more than one measure per predictor/level in a paired test for each subject. You have two levels, stamina0 and stamina\\+. Therefore, you can only have two measures / subject.\n\nAlternatively, you could use mixed effects modelling that will allow you to use the number of cookies and hours and generate a much more precise model of what is going on."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the effect of a stamina-enhancing treatment on cookie production. Before treatment, subjects could work for 4 hours, and after treatment, they could work for 7 hours.

What is the most appropriate approach?\n\nA) Use a paired Wilcoxon test, adding NA values to the pre-treatment data to match the length of post-treatment data\nB) Use an unpaired Wilcoxon test, since the number of observations is different before and after treatment\nC) Aggregate the data to comparable paired measures (e.g., cookies/hour) for each subject, then use a paired Wilcoxon test\nD) Use the raw data with different lengths in a paired Wilcoxon test, as R will automatically handle the discrepancy\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to aggregate the data to comparable paired measures for each subject before using a paired Wilcoxon test. This is because:\n\nA) Adding NA values artificially inflates the dataset and may lead to incorrect results.\nB) An unpaired test is not appropriate when the data are from the same subjects before and after treatment.\nC) Aggregating the data (e.g., to cookies/hour) allows for a proper paired comparison while accounting for the different working hours.\nD) R will not automatically handle data with different lengths in a paired test, and this approach would lead to an error or incorrect results.\n\nThe key is to ensure that each subject has only one measure per condition (before and after treatment) that can be directly compared.

We've created mapped logins in SQL Server to these groups and given them access to the database for the application.

I had a large\\-ish training set and so I randomly (stratified random sampling) set aside a test set. I fitted $m$ different methods to the training set samples and using the $m$ resulting models I predicted the response for the test set samples and computed a RMSEP over the samples in the test set. This is a single **run**.\n\nI then repeated this process a large number of times, each time I chose a different training set by randomly sampling a new test set.\n\nHaving done this I want to investigate if any of the $m$ methods has better or worse RMSEP performance. I also would like to do multiple comparisons of the pair\\-wise methods.\n\nMy approach has been to fit a linear mixed effects (LME) model, with a single random effect for **Run**. I used `lmer()` from the **lme4** package to fit my model and functions from the **multcomp** package to perform the multiple comparisons. My model was essentially\n\n```\nlmer(RMSEP ~ method + (1 | Run), data = FOO)\n\n```\n\nwhere `method` is a factor indicating which method was used to generate the model predictions for the test set and `Run` is an indicator for each particular **Run** of my \"experiment\".\n\nMy question is in regard to the residuals of the LME.

The results between runs will definitely be dependent, since they are based on the same data and you have overlap between your train/test sets. The question is whether this should matter when you come to compare the methods.\n\nLet's say you would perform only one run, and would find that one method is better than the others. You would then ask yourself \\- is this simply due to the specific choice of test set? This is why you repeat your test for many different train/test sets. So, in order to determine that a method is better than other methods, you run many times and in each run compare it to the other methods (you have different options of looking at the error/rank/etc). Now, if you find that a method does better on most runs, the result is what it is. I am not sure it is helpful to give a p\\-value to this.

In fact, not long ago I took up the task of learning Spring/MVC\\+Hibernate.

So, an alternative approach is to user `super`, which uses the MRO (see Option 1\\) to determine which base implementation to use. By using MRO, it avoids diamond inheritance problems. However, it has to be used systematically on all classes and even then it has its caveats.\n\n```\nclass CommonBase(object):\n    def create(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Base1(CommonBase):\n    def create(self):\n        super(Base1, self).create()\n\nclass Base2(CommonBase):\n    def create(self):\n        super(Base2, self).create()\n\nclass C(Base1, Base2):\n    def create(self):\n        super(C, self).create()\n\n```\n\nHere, `C().create()` will call all four `create` methods, each once."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the following class hierarchy:\n\n```python\nclass BaseClient(object):\n    def create(self):\n        print(\"BaseClient create\")\n\nclass Account(BaseClient):\n    def create(self):\n        print(\"Account create\")\n\nclass User(BaseClient):\n    def create(self):\n        print(\"User create\")\n\nclass MainClass(Account, User):\n    def create(self):\n        super(MainClass, self).create()\n\nmc = MainClass()\nmc.create()\n```\n\nWhat will be printed when `mc.create()` is called?\n\nA) BaseClient create\nB) Account create\nC) User create\nD) Account create\n   User create\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In this case, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) comes into play.

Yep, it's `true`, the closure returns `null` because `this` is not initialized when it executes.\n\n**Edit**\n\nI was curious about Thomas's statement, thinking that maybe they'd changed the behaviour in a subsequent VS release.

It was closed as \"won't fix.\" Odd.\n\nAs Microsoft says in their response, it is normally invalid to use the `this` reference from within the argument list of a base constructor call; the reference simply does not exist at that point in time and you will actually get a compile\\-time error if you try to use it \"naked.\" So, arguably it *should* produce a compile error for the closure case, but the `this` reference is hidden from the compiler, which (at least in VS 2008\\) would have to know to *look* for it inside the closure in order to prevent people from doing this.

Redshift.\n\nYour question is a tricky one because you from the observer's view cannot have a moving chain and a frozen chain at the same time.\n\n> Arbitrarily close hovering observers will never see anything cross the horizon because of the extreme redshift\n\n[When looking for a black hole, will we always find a collapsing star instead?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/496050/when-looking-for-a-black-hole-will-we-always-find-a-collapsing-star-instead/496068#496068)\n\nThe answer to your question is extreme redshift. Not only is there extreme time dilation at the horizon, but also extreme redshift. So the links that are closest to the horizon will disappear because the photons coming from them are redshifted so that we cannot detect them any more.\n\nSo there is no discrepancy, the observer sees the chain moving, and the links that are closest to the horizon will disappear (because the photons coming from them are redshifted so that we cannot detect them)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An observer watches a long chain falling into a black hole. As the chain approaches the event horizon, what phenomenon primarily explains why the observer cannot see the end of the chain crossing the horizon, even though the chain continues to move from the observer's perspective?\n\nA) Time dilation\nB) Gravitational lensing\nC) Extreme redshift\nD) Tidal forces\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C) Extreme redshift. As the chain approaches the event horizon of the black hole, the light emitted from the links closest to the horizon experiences extreme redshift. This means that the photons from these links are shifted to such long wavelengths that they become undetectable to the observer. \n\nWhile time dilation (A) does occur near a black hole, it doesn't directly explain why the observer can't see the chain crossing the horizon. Gravitational lensing (B) can distort the appearance of objects near a black hole but doesn't cause them to disappear. Tidal forces (D) can affect objects near a black hole but don't explain the visual phenomenon described.\n\nThe extreme redshift effectively makes the end of the chain invisible to the observer, creating the illusion that the chain is frozen near the horizon while still moving at a distance. This resolves the apparent paradox of how a long length of chain can seem to fit into a smaller space from the observer's perspective."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/03/27", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19495", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/4721/"], "docs_id": 19495, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was told that one of the most efficient tools (e.g. in terms of computations relevant to physics, but also in terms of guessing heuristically mathematical facts) that physicists use is the so called \"Feynman path integral\", which, as far as I understand, means \"integrating\" a functional (action) on some infinite\\-dimentional space of configurations (fields) of a system.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that, except for some few instances like Gaussian\\-type integrals, the quotation marks cannot be eliminated in the term \"integration\", cause a mathematically sound integration theory on infinite\\-dimensional spaces \u2014 I was told \u2014 has not been invented yet.\n\nI would like to know the state of the art of the attempts to make this \"path integral\" into a well\\-defined mathematical entity.\n\nDifficulties of analytical nature are certainly present, but I read somewhere that perhaps the true nature of path integral would be hidden in some combinatorial or higher\\-categorical structures which are not yet understood...\n\nEdit: I should be more precise about the kind of answer that I expected to this question. I was not asking about reference for books/articles in which the path integral is treated at length and in detail. I'd have just liked to have some \"fresh\", (relatively) concise and not too\\-specialistic account of the situation; something like: \"Essentially the problems are due to this and this, and there have been approaches X, Y, Z that focus on A, B, C; some progress have been made in ... but problems remain in ...\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not accurate to say that no theory of integration on infinite\\-dimensional spaces exists. The Euclidean\\-signature Feynman measure has been constructed \\-\\- as a measure on a space of distributions \\-\\- in a number of non\\-trivial cases, mainly by the Constructive QFT school in the 70s. \n\nThe mathematical constructions reflect the physical ideas of effective quantum field theory: One obtains the measure on the space of field histories as the limit of a sequence/net of \"regularized\" integrals, which encode how the effective \"long distance\" degrees of freedom interact with each other after one averages out the short distance degrees of freedom in various ways. (You can imagine here that long/short distance refers to some wavelet basis, and that we get the sequence of regularized integrals by varying the way we divide the wavelet basis into short distance and long distance components.)\n\nI don't think the main problem in the subject is that we need some new notion of integration. The Feynman measures we mathematicians can construct exhibit all the richness of the \"higher categories\" axioms, and moreover, the numerical computations in lattice gauge theory and in statistical physics indicates that the existing framework is at the least a very good approximation. \n\nThe problem, rather, is that we need a better way of constructing examples. At the moment, you have to *guess* which family of regularized integrals you ought to study when you try to construct any particular example. (In Glimm \\& Jaffe's book, for example, they simply replace the interaction Lagrangian with the corresponding \"normally ordered\" Lagrangian. In lattice gauge theory, they use short\\-distance continuum perturbation theory to figure out what the lattice action should be.) \n\nThen \\-\\- and this is the really hard and physically interesting part \\-\\- you have to have enough analytic control on the family to say which observables (functions on the space of distributions) are integrable with respect to the limiting continuum measure.

Create a layer (layerA) with some dragable features. Create a DragFeature control for this layer. Activate the control. Add the layerA to the map.\n\nNOTE: Do not create more than one control per layer, that screw\\-up everything at the last step for some reason.\n2. Create an other layer (layerB) with some dragable features. Create a DragFeature control for this layer as well. Activate the control. Add the layerB to the map.\n\nNOTE: At this point, only the last added layer, layerB, will have working Drag events.\n3. Create a SelectFeature control, even if you don't need one, for both layerA and layerB:\n\nnew OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature(\\[layerA, layerB], {...});\n4. Activate the SelectFeature. This will \"magically\" enable the DragFeature control for both layerA and layerB.\n\nNOTE: The SelectFeature MUST be activated after the two DragFeature, otherwise it won't work.\n\nI think this procedure is quite strait forward. But I can provide some example if needed.\n\nIt also works with more than 2 layers.\n\nIf the dragable layers are added dynamically, you must use the method setLayer() of the SelectFeature to set the new array of layers, after activating the drag feature control of the new layer. This will re\\-activate the SelectFeature layer and everything should continue to works as expected.\n\n\\[edit] Layer.setOpacity(opacity) will stop working for all layers added to the SelectFeature.

To achieve maximum dimming, a combination of techniques is needed to expand the control range, which option D best addresses."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/01/22", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/687436", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/87918/"], "docs_id": 687436, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can ping *google.com* for several seconds and when I press `Ctrl` \\+ `C`, a brief summary is displayed at the bottom:\n\n```\n$ ping google.com\nPING google.com (74.125.131.113) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=46.7 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=45.0 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=4 ttl=56 time=54.5 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 3 received, 25% packet loss, time 3009ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 44.965/48.719/54.524/4.163 ms\n\n```\n\nHowever, when I do the same redirecting output to log file with `tee`, the summary is not displayed:\n\n```\n$ ping google.com | tee log\nPING google.com (74.125.131.113) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=34.1 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=57.0 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=3 ttl=57 time=50.9 ms\n^C\n\n```\n\nCan I get the summary as well when redirecting output with `tee`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `ping` shows the summary when it is killed with `SIGINT`, *e.g.* as a result of `Ctrl``C`, or when it has transmitted the requested number of packets (the `-c` option). `Ctrl``C` causes `SIGINT` to be sent to all processes in the foreground process group, *i.e.* in this scenario all the processes in the pipeline (`ping` and `tee`). `tee` doesn\u2019t catch `SIGINT` (on Linux, look at `SigCgt` in `/proc/$(pgrep tee)/status`), so when it receives the signal, it dies, closing its end of the pipe. What happens next is a race: if `ping` was still outputting, it will die with `SIGPIPE` before it gets the `SIGINT`; if it gets the `SIGINT` before outputting anything, it will try to output its summary and die with `SIGPIPE`. In any case, there\u2019s no longer anywhere for the output to go.\n\nTo get the summary, arrange to kill only `ping` with `SIGINT`:\n\n```\nkillall -INT ping\n\n```\n\nor run it with a pre\\-determined number of packets:\n\n```\nping -c 20 google.com | tee log\n\n```\n\nor (keeping the best for last), [have `tee` ignore `SIGINT`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/687672/86440), as you discovered."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the `ping` command with output redirection through `tee`, why doesn't the summary statistics typically appear when you press Ctrl+C?\n\nA) The `tee` command actively suppresses the summary statistics\nB) The `ping` command cannot generate statistics when its output is piped\nC) The SIGINT signal terminates both `ping` and `tee`, preventing `ping` from outputting the summary\nD) The `tee` command modifies the output format of `ping`, removing the summary\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When you use `ping` with `tee` (e.g., `ping google.com | tee log`), pressing Ctrl+C sends a SIGINT signal to both `ping` and `tee`. The `tee` command doesn't catch this signal, so it terminates immediately, closing its end of the pipe. This creates a race condition where `ping` may either die from a SIGPIPE before receiving SIGINT, or try to output its summary but fail due to the closed pipe. In either case, the summary doesn't appear in the output. This behavior is different from running `ping` alone, where it has time to output the summary before terminating. The other options are incorrect: `tee` doesn't actively suppress or modify the output (A and D), and `ping` is capable of generating statistics when piped (B), but the issue is related to signal handling and process termination."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/11", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/46696948", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2851914/"], "docs_id": 46696948, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to find the total count of rows in SQL Server.\nBelow query returns me 1 in all rows.\nCan I use sub query to calculate the RowCounts Column?

Let me assume that $E$ is modular. Then there will be some level 1 Hilbert modular form over $F$ corresponding to $E$. But my understanding is that the cohomology of $E$ will not show up in any of the \"usual suspect\" Shimura varieties associated to this situation (the level 1 Hilbert modular surface, or any Shimura curve \\[the reason it can't show up here is that a quaternion algebra ramified at precisely one infinite place must also ramify at one finite place]).\n\nIf you want a more concrete assertion, I am saying that the Tate module of $E$, or any twist of this, shouldn't show up as a subquotient of the etale cohomology of the Shimura varieties attached to $GL(2\\)$ or any of its inner forms over $F$ (my knowledge of the cohomology of Hilbert modular surfaces is poor though; I hope I have this right).\n\nBut here's the question. I have it in my head that someone once told me that $E$ (or perhaps more precisely the motive attached to $E$) should not show up in the cohomology of *any* Shimura variety.

And I believe I was once assured by an expert that the kind of variety for which problems might occur is the elliptic curve over $F$ mentioned above. At the time I did not understand the reasons given to me for why this should be the case, so of course now I can't reproduce them.\n\nHave I got this right or have I got my wires crossed?\n\nEDIT (more precisely, \"addition\"): Milne's comment below seems to indicate that I did misremember, and that in fact I was probably only told what Milne mentions below.

Shimura's paper \"Construction of class fields and zeta functions of algebraic curves\" suggests (according to MathSciNet) how to construct a Shimura variety of dimension 2 that isn't a curve but is associated to the relevant quaternion algebra. Shimura lets the quaternion algebra act on the product of two copies of the upper half plane instead of 1, and is able to show the relevant variety is defined over Q by using Siegel modular forms.

Option A is incorrect because the cohomology of E is not expected to show up in the usual Shimura varieties associated with this situation, including the Hilbert modular surface.

The solution is to install a water pressure booster pump.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The symptoms described (cold water fixtures not working in winter, but functioning when weather warms up) strongly suggest frozen pipes. The fact that the problem recurs each winter and affects only cold water fixtures in a specific area indicates that the cold water pipes are likely poorly insulated in a cold space, such as the attic or an exterior wall. \n\nWhile temporary measures like heating the room or insulating the exterior wall might provide some relief, the best long-term solution is to properly insulate the cold water pipes throughout their entire run.
