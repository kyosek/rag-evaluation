Using a series diode and a flyback diode provides the most effective protection for the power supply against reverse voltage from inductive loads like motors.\n\nThe series diode prevents current from flowing back into the power supply, while the flyback diode provides a path for the inductive kickback current to dissipate safely when the motor is switched off.\n\nOption A (TVS diode) is incorrect because while it can protect against voltage spikes, it doesn't prevent reverse current flow.\n\nOption B (RC snubber) can help reduce voltage spikes but doesn't fully protect against reverse current.\n\nOption D (bridge rectifier) is unnecessary and doesn't specifically address the reverse voltage issue from inductive loads.\n\nThe schematic provided in the original answer illustrates the correct implementation of the series and flyback diodes, making it the most suitable solution for protecting the power supply."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/09", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/471535", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/223029/"], "docs_id": 471535, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to find a creative solution to the problem:\n\n**Find the electric potential energy of a uniformly charged sphere of radius $R$ possessing a charge $Q$.** \n\nMy attempt at a solution:\n\nConsider a gaussian surface, basically a sphere of radius $x$ concentric with the complete charged sphere.

In fact, it seems you are not very clear with the concept of energy density. \n\nEnergy density is the energy per unit volume. What is important for this question is to realise is that you can use the energy density as a function of $x$ as long as it agrees with the value the electric field would have inside the sphere, and then outside the sphere. \n\nClearly, as you have derived the E\\-field is varying directly as $x$ inside. If you apply Gauss' law for a region outside the sphere, you get that the electric field varies as $1/x^2$.\n\nThese fields are clearly different in their functional forms. So what you need to do while calculating the potential energy of the sphere is to add the contribution inside and outside the sphere. \n\ni.e. $ U\\_1 \\= \\\\int \\\\Omega\\_1 dV$ having the limits of $x\\=0$ to $x\\=R$ (inside the sphere)\n\nAnd $U\\_2 \\= \\\\int \\\\Omega\\_2 dV$ having the limits of $x\\=R$ to $x \\\\to \\\\infty$. \n\nThe required potential energy will be: $U\\=U\\_1 \\+U\\_2$. You would find that $U\\_1$ is having a number factor of 1/40 as you have found already. And $U\\_2$ would have a factor of 1/8\\. Add them together and you get $\\\\frac{3Q^2}{20 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon R}$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A uniformly charged sphere of radius R and total charge Q is given.

This result comes from considering both the energy stored inside the sphere and outside it.\n\nOption A only accounts for the energy inside the sphere, which gives a factor of 1/40.\nOption B is correct, combining both internal and external contributions.\nOption C represents only the external contribution, with a factor of 1/8.\nOption D is incorrect and doesn't match any part of the calculation.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that the electric field behaves differently inside and outside the sphere, necessitating separate calculations for each region and then summing the results."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/26", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/37715", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/8234/"], "docs_id": 37715, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was brushing up on usage of **if\\-clauses** and came across one misunderstanding. M. Swan provide some sentences as an example in the lesson about unrealised present and future possibilities:\n\n> 1. If my mother had been alive, she would have been 80 next year.\n> 2. If my mother were alive, she would be 80 next year.\n\nThese two sentences have exactly the same meaning and it's more\\-or\\-less clear to me. \n\nHe also provides the following example:\n\n> 3. If I became President, I'd be a good one. \\-\\- (said by schoolboy)\n\nCan it be said as:\n\n> 4. If I had become President, I'd have been a good one.\n\nwith the same meaning?\n\nI think, no it can't. This is because the situation is pure\\-imaginary at the moment and it doesn't relate to some unrealised past, present or future possibilities. Is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are three kinds of *if\\-clauses*. In each kind of *if\\-clause*, the tense of the verb communicates two important ideas about the *condition* that affects the main clause of the sentence. The tense of the verb in the *if\\-clause* communicates:\n\n1. The *time perspective* of the condition\n\n**AND**\n\n2. The *nature* of the condition\n\n---\n\nLet's consider the pair of Presidential conditions first:\n\n> *If I became President, I'd be a good one. \\-\\- (said by schoolboy)*\n\n* *Became* is the ***past tense*** of *become*.\n* The *past tense* creates a ***present time perspective***, as in *\"If I knew, I would tell you,\"* or, *\"If I had some money, I would buy that,\"* (but the word *became* directs our attention to the future **within** that present time perspective).\n* The *past tense* implies that the condition is ***improbable*** or *impossible*.\n* The **meaning** of the sentence is:\n\n\"*Probably, I am **not** becoming President, but I would be a good one, if I did*.\"\n\nIt makes sense for a school boy's imagination to present that idea in a sentence. A school boy would not be in a position to say the second sentence about becoming President (of the United States) with any credibility:\n\n> *If I had become President, I'd have been a good one.*\n\n* *Had become* is the ***past perfect tense*** of *become*.\n* The *past perfect tense* creates a ***past time perspective***.\n* The *past perfect tense* implies that the condition is ***impossible***.\n* The **meaning** of the sentence is:\n\n\"*I did **not** become President, but I would have been a good one, if I had*.\" \n\nSince a school boy is not old enough to run for President of the United Staes, it would have been nonsense, if he had said that. The sentence is something a loosing candidate might say.\n\n---\n\nThe second pair of conditions communicates some *impossible alternatives* to a death condition:\n\n> *If my mother were alive, she would be 80 next year.*\n\n* *Were* is the ***past tense*** of *is*.\n* The *past tense* creates a ***present time perspective***\n* The *past tense* implies that the condition is *improbable* or ***impossible***.\n* The **meaning** of the sentence is:\n\n\"*My mother is **not** alive, but she would be 80 next year, if she were*.\"\\*\n\nThe words *next year* could create the same kind of time confusion as the word *become* did in the Presidential pair, but *next year* is in reference to the present time perspective. The other if clause communicates a similar meaning from a different perspective:\n\n> *If my mother had been alive, she would have been 80 next year.*\n\n* *Had had been* is the ***past perfect tense*** of *is*.\n* The *past perfect tense* creates a ***past time perspective***.\n* The *past perfect tense* implies that the condition is ***impossible***.\n* The **meaning** of the sentence is:\n\n\"*My mother was **not** alive, but she would have been 80 next year, if she had been.*\"\n\nThis construction is awkward, because the words *next year* seem to conflict with the *past time perspective*, but because death is a permanent condition, the meaning of the sentence survives well enough in the readers mind.\n\n---\n\nConditional clauses can be confusing because:\n\n1. The **time perspective** of *if\\-clauses* does not always match the **tense**\nof the verb.\n\nAND\n\n2. The verb also does the unique work of implying the\n**nature of the condition**.\n\n---\n\nThis question only compared the second and third conditional clauses, but to put them in perspective.\n\n**First conditional:**\n\n> * uses the **present** tense of the verb\n> * creates a **present** or **future** time perspective\n> * implies an **open** condition, that is something considered real or possible\n\n**Second conditional:**\n\n> * uses the **past** tense of the verb\n> * creates a **present** time perspective\n> * implies an **unreal**, **improbable** or **impossible** condition\n\n**Third conditional:**\n\n> * uses the **past perfect** tense of the verb\n> * creates a **past** time perspective\n> * implies an **unreal** **impossible** condition\n\nSome instructors refer to a [zero conditional](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verbs-conditional_5.htm) as a special case of the first conditional."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about conditional clauses is NOT correct?\n\nA) The past tense in a second conditional clause creates a present time perspective and implies an unreal, improbable, or impossible condition.\n\nB) In a third conditional clause, the past perfect tense creates a past time perspective and implies an impossible condition.\n\nC) The tense of the verb in an if-clause communicates both the time perspective and the nature of the condition.\n\nD) In a first conditional clause, the present tense always creates a present time perspective and implies a condition that is considered impossible.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is incorrect because it misrepresents the first conditional clause.

Don't forget to include whether this suggestion is **global** (ie. synchronized meetups), or only for your location.\n3. If it's a suggestion for only a single location, *include the location*.\n4. Add in any extra details that might be relevant.\n5. Try to lead it out by a couple months, at least. It will take some time to arrange everything for us responsible adults. Plus, I have to dump the framework for later parts. Less lead time \\= less chance I can get pull it all together.\n\n---\n\n**Instructions for voters**\n\n* Upvote if you can make it.\n* Leave a comment (or upvote someone else's comment) if it's your preferred date range. (Especially if we get multiple time frames for the same location)\n* Downvote a suggestion if you *can't* make it. This includes synchronized date ranges.\n\n---\n\n**Closing**\n\nRemember, this whole thing is to get all of us into the same location(s) so we can put faces to these crazy internet handles of ours. This is going to be pretty fluid, so no guarantees on when Part 4 goes live. The date ranges selected will dictate how much time we have to figure things out.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Philadelphia Meetup\n-------------------\n\nIf anyone is interested in a Philadelphia meetup, I can help out to scout out locations, as I'm located in the suburbs near Philadelphia.\n\n**Transportation**:\n\n* For those in the neighboring states such as NY, NJ, DE, or MD, I would recommend the buses (Greyhound \\[drops off near Chinatown], Bolt \\[drops off outside of 30th street Station, Philadelphia's closest equivalent to NYC's Grand Central Station]) over Amtrak (very pricey). From NJ you can take NJ Transit in, but their high speed rail line.\n* For those flying in Philadelphia's SEPTA transportation system offers regional rail transportation to and from Philadelphia International Airport.\n\n**For places of interest:**\n\n* [University Pinball](http://www.yelp.com/biz/university-pinball-philadelphia) located near UPenn's campus in West Philadelphia\n* [Barcade](http://www.yelp.com/biz/barcade-philadelphia) located in NE Philly, near Fishtown. It's within walking distance of The Girard St. Subway Station\n* [North Bowl](http://www.yelp.com/biz/north-bowl-philadelphia) located in Northern Liberties, north of Spring Garden St.\n* (**New!**) [Boardwalk Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/boardwalk-bar-philadelphia) A new outdoor/indoor arcade bar in Northern Liberties that just open in September.\n\n**Some places to eat, relax, and have fun:**\n\n* [National Mechanics](http://nationalmechanics.com/philadelphia-old-city-bar) This place is one of my personal favorites. They hold regular events monthly and quizzo on Wednesdays.\n* [Nodding Head](http://www.ripsneakers.com/nodding/) Good food and great beer (some they brew themselves!).\n* [The Standard Tap](http://news.standardtap.com.s86406.gridserver.com/) This is the place to sample local brews and great food. It is said that it was them that started the gastropub movement in Philadelphia back in 1994\\.\n* [Monk's Belgian Cafe](http://www.monkscafe.com/) Come in for some good mussels of their special duck salad sandwich, or perhaps sit down and sample from their great selection of brews (perhaps the largest in the city?).\n\n**Meeting places**:\n\nDepending on how large the crowd is, some good places to meet are:\n\n* [30th Street Station](http://goo.gl/maps/eDKkq), convenient access to SEPTA transportion (subways, rail lines, and buses) and AMTRAK trains.\n* [Suburban Station](http://goo.gl/maps/lMPPe), located near the center of the city, quick access to the Avenue of the Arts, if you in enjoy music and theater and a variety of great restaurants.\n* [Market East Station](http://goo.gl/maps/uatMO), located neat the Greyhound/Peter Pan bus terminal, convenient to the subways, and it's very close to Philadelphia's Chinatown, and it's famous [Reading Terminal Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/reading-terminal-market-philadelphia). It's access is also available to the PA Convention Center.\n* [Washington Square](http://goo.gl/maps/8n41U), it's a great outside location to gather and hangout.\n\nThere's also many other touristy spots to visit while in the city. If anyone is interested, I'll add a guide to the various spots in and around the city (including the location of ALL the Philly Phanatic statues).\n\n**On cheese steaks**\n\nPersonally, I think Pat's and Geno's are very overrated. Their steaks are not particularly good compared to the better places, especially the quality of the meat. It's more of a cultural experience than anything else.\n\nYou can try:\n\n* [Tony Luke's](http://www.tonylukes.com/) on Oregon Ave.\n* [Chink's](http://www.chinksteaks.com/store/magento/) on Torresdale Ave in the Northeast.\n* [Delassandro's](http://dalessandros.com/) on Wendover St.\n\nAll of the above will provide a superior steak expereince.\n\n* I hear that [John's Roast Pork](http://www.johnsroastpork.com/) on Snyder Ave has some quality steaks as well, but I haven't been there personally.\n\n**On ramen**\n\nBelieve it or not, Philadelphia as some pretty decent ramen places.\n\n* [Hiro Ramen](http://hiroramen.com/hiro/): 1102 Chestnut St.\n* [Terakawa Ramen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/terakawa-ramen-philadelphia)\\*: 204 N. Ninth St.\n* [Nom Nom Ramen](http://www.nomnomramen.com/)\\*: 20 S. 18th St.\n* [Green Wasabi](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-green-wasabi-philadelphia): 20 S. 18th St.\n* [Ramen Bar](http://www.ramenbarphilly.com/): 4040 Locust St.\n\n\\* I like these places.\n\n**Date of meetup**:\n\n* A Saturday would work best, giving people some time to recover and head back Sunday.\n* Perhaps a Friday evening or Saturday morning icebreaker for those that can make it.\n* As for the day and month, I'm open to suggestions.\n\n**Inquires**\n\nIf you are looking to go sight\\-seeing around Philadelphia, I can give you suggestions and tips on how to get there, what to do, and what you want to steer clear of."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: You are planning a meetup in Philadelphia for a group of online friends.

It's a bit surprising that this doesn't contain any discussion of equivalence testing. To me it's somewhat obvious and reasonable that the p\\-value maintains its uniform distribution when the null is true considering larger and larger $n$. Large $n$ means having sensitivity to detect smaller and smaller effects, while the false positive error rate remains fixed. So under the somewhat constrained setting of the null being *exactly* true, the behavior of the $p$\\-value distribution doesn't depend on $n$ at all.\n\n1. NHST is, in my mind, desirable specifically because there's no way of declaring a null hypothesis to be true, as my experimental design is setup specifically to disprove it. A non\\-significant result may mean that my experiment was underpowered or the assumptions were wrong, so there are risks associated with accepting the null that I'd rather not incur.\n2. We never actually believe that the null hypothesis is true. Typically failed designs arise because the truth is too close to the null to be detectable. Having too much data is kind of a bad thing in this case, rather there's a subtle art in designing a study to obtain only enough sample size so as to reject the null when a *meaningful* difference is present.\n3. One can design a frequentist test that sequentially tests for differences (one or two tailed), and depending on a negative result, performs an equivalence test (declare that the null is true as a significant result). In the latter case one can show that the power of an equivalence test goes to 1 when the null is in fact true."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the relationship between p-values and sample size when the null hypothesis is true.

Start from expanding the L.H.S to have $$L.H.S\\=\\\\sum y\\_i^2\\+\\\\sum(\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\+\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}x\\_i)^2\\-2\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\\\sum y\\_i\\-2\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}\\\\sum (y\\_ix\\_i)$$ which is $$L.H.S\\=\\\\Big\\[\\\\sum y\\_i^2\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\\\sum y\\_i\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}\\\\sum (y\\_ix\\_i)\\\\Big]\\+\\\\sum(\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\+\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}x\\_i)^2\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\\\sum y\\_i\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}.\\\\sum (y\\_ix\\_i).$$ Now what we have inside the bracket is actually the R.H.S. So you need to show that the rest is zero i.e. $$\\\\sum(\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\+\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}x\\_i)^2\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}\\\\sum y\\_i\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}\\\\sum (y\\_ix\\_i)\\=0\\.$$ Now to show this, I will give you some hints. You need to do them correctly and step by step.\n\n1. Replace $\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_0}$ by $\\\\bar{y}\\-\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}\\\\bar{x}$ to re\\-write it all based on $\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}$.\n2. Expand the terms and simplify (some terms will be canceled out).\n3. Now use two facts:  \n\n(1\\): $\\\\hat{\\\\beta\\_1}\\=\\\\dfrac{S\\_{xy}}{S\\_{xx}},$ where $S\\_{xy}\\=\\\\sum(x\\_i\\-\\\\bar{x})(y\\_i\\-\\\\bar{y})$ and $S\\_{xx}\\=\\\\sum(x\\_i\\-\\\\bar{x})^2$ and  \n\n(2\\): $S\\_{xy}\\=\\\\sum (x\\_iy\\_i)\\-\\\\dfrac{\\\\sum x\\_i .\\\\sum y\\_i}{n}$  \n\nto write everything in terms of $S\\_{xy}$ and $S\\_{xx}$.\n4. Simplify to show that it is zero."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of simple linear regression, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the sum of squared residuals and the estimated coefficients?\n\nA) The sum of squared residuals can be expressed as \u03a3(yi - \u03b2\u03020 - \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 = \u03a3yi\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3xiyi + \u03a3(\u03b2\u03020 + \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2\n\nB) The term \u03a3(\u03b2\u03020 + \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3(xiyi) always equals zero when \u03b2\u03020 and \u03b2\u03021 are the least squares estimates\n\nC) The relationship \u03a3(yi - \u03b2\u03020 - \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 = \u03a3yi\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3xiyi holds true regardless of how \u03b2\u03020 and \u03b2\u03021 are calculated\n\nD) The proof of the identity \u03a3(yi - \u03b2\u03020 - \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 = \u03a3yi\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3xiyi requires using the fact that \u03b2\u03021 = Sxy / Sxx, where Sxy and Sxx are the sample covariance and variance respectively\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct. The term \u03a3(\u03b2\u03020 + \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3(xiyi) indeed equals zero when \u03b2\u03020 and \u03b2\u03021 are the least squares estimates. This is a crucial step in proving the identity \u03a3(yi - \u03b2\u03020 - \u03b2\u03021xi)\u00b2 = \u03a3yi\u00b2 - \u03b2\u03020\u03a3yi - \u03b2\u03021\u03a3xiyi. The proof involves substituting \u03b2\u03020 = \u0233 - \u03b2\u03021x\u0304, expanding terms, and using the relationships \u03b2\u03021 = Sxy / Sxx and Sxy = \u03a3(xiyi) - (\u03a3xi * \u03a3yi)/n. After these substitutions and simplifications, the term can be shown to equal zero, which is essential for the identity to hold.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it adds an extra term to the right side of the equation, which doesn't belong in the correct identity.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the relationship only holds true when \u03b2\u03020 and \u03b2\u03021 are the least squares estimates, not for arbitrary values.\n\nOption D is partially correct but incomplete. While the proof does use the fact that \u03b2\u03021 = Sxy / Sxx, this alone is not sufficient to prove the identity. Additional steps and relationships are needed for the complete proof."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/165489", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/46609/"], "docs_id": 165489, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have one problem with enumerating.

Consistency: By defining a custom environment (like 'roster' in the example), you ensure that enumerations look the same in both theorem-like environments and proofs.\n\n2.

The issue is caused by macOS assigning system-wide shortcuts that conflict with the application-specific shortcuts in Microsoft Word. By disabling the Mission Control shortcuts in System Preferences \u2192 Keyboard \u2192 Shortcuts, the user can restore the Control + Arrow key functionality for word-by-word navigation in Word documents. This solution directly addresses the conflict between the operating system shortcuts and the desired application behavior without requiring software reinstallation or system upgrades.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reinstalling Word would not address the system-level shortcut conflict. Option B is unnecessary and may not solve the issue, as the problem is with shortcut assignments, not the OS version. Option D is unrelated to the shortcut conflict and would not resolve the issue."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/07", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/154217", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/83295/"], "docs_id": 154217, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I installed a bunch of applications via SSH on a Debian Wheezy server.

I would reason as follows:\n\n1. Let $I$ be the annihilator of $L\\_1(G)$ in $M$. Then a) $I$ is weakly closed (obvious); b) $I$ is an ideal. To prove the second thing, consider the quotient map $Q: M\\\\to L\\_1(G)^\\*$.

For example, if you consider the model of random regular graphs of degree $d$ (graphs chosen uniformly from all $d$ regular graphs on $n$ vertices), and let $X\\_i$ denote the number of cycles of length $i$, then Bollob\u00e1s and Wormald independently showed that the $X\\_i$ behaved asymptotically as independent Poisson variables with mean \n$(d\\-1\\)^i/(2i)$. \n\nIn other words: There's a positive probability that a graph contains each of $3$\\-cycles, $4$\\-cycles, etc. Because these events are asymptotically independent, \"most\" $d\\-$regular graphs have bounded girth. On the other hand, the number of cycles of each fixed length on average remains bounded even as the size of the graph tends to infinity. So if I fix a single vertex and look in the neighborhood of that vertex, I have to look at farther and farther distance before I see any cycles at all. (But not too far...as Louigi noted, we can't expect to go much past the $\\\\log n$ diameter of the graph).

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the local structure and cycles in such a graph as n approaches infinity?\n\nA) The girth of the graph (length of the shortest cycle) is always O(log n).\n\nB) Most vertices are contained in multiple short cycles of length O(log n).\n\nC) The expected number of cycles of any fixed length k remains bounded as n increases.\n\nD) The graph is guaranteed to be acyclic in any local neighborhood of radius O(log n) around a typical vertex.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. For sparse random graphs:\n\n1. The expected number of cycles of any fixed length k remains bounded as n increases. This is similar to the behavior described for random regular graphs, where the number of cycles of each fixed length on average remains bounded even as the graph size grows.\n\n2. Option A is incorrect because while the diameter of such graphs is typically O(log n), this doesn't guarantee that the girth (shortest cycle) is of this order. In fact, short cycles can exist with positive probability.\n\n3. Option B is incorrect because although short cycles can exist, most vertices are not contained in multiple short cycles. The locally tree-like property suggests that short cycles are relatively rare in the local neighborhood of a typical vertex.\n\n4. Option D is too strong. While the graph is locally tree-like, meaning that cycles become rarer in local neighborhoods, it's not guaranteed to be acyclic within any O(log n) radius. There's still a positive probability of finding cycles, albeit with decreasing likelihood as we consider smaller radii.\n\nThe correct answer captures the essence of the locally tree-like property: fixed-length cycles remain bounded in expectation, allowing for some cycles but ensuring they're relatively rare in local neighborhoods as the graph grows."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/26", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1149885", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/655224/"], "docs_id": 1149885, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a way to create a virtual machine based on an actual device, if so, how would someone do it?\n\nNote: The emulator should have the same ROM as the device.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not the answer you're looking for and maybe you already know but Android Studio let's you select various devices for virtual emulation and if you really want you can create your own hardware profiles."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a multi-form question for an exam:\n\nQuestion: A developer wants to create a virtual machine that closely mimics their physical Android device for testing purposes.

For example, my e\\-book reader use an unpartitioned space to store uboot, kernel and other data.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general it is not safe. The FS assumes that operations are written in certain order so it can write new data of file and then make a pointer to it from other data, the exact details depend on filesystem. Imagine if following happens:\n\n1. `dd` reads from location X which contains garbage or some data\n2. Filesystem writes to location X\n3. Filesystem writes to location X\\+1 pointer to location X\n4. `dd` reads from location X\\+1 link to location X\n\nFrom the point of view of backup you get a garbage data. However there are several ways to workaround it:\n\n* Freeze filesystem by filesystem specific command (I believe `xfs_freeze` is one and I don't know any other \\- but such option exists at least in theory)\n* Create a lvm snapshot and copy from it. The copy will be as\\-if you rebooted the computer (minus the HDD reordering) so it will be a dirty filesystem but the copy will be atomic. Note that some filesystems like XFS needs to be frozen first.\n* Use rsync as suggested by others. Now the copy is safe and you don't need LVM but the copy is not atomic. So while it avoids the above problem on filesystem level it might still run into problems with files (rather unlikely but one can imagine missing files while mv is executed in background for example)\n* Use filesystem with snapshoting such as [btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/), [tux3](http://www.tux3.org/), [zfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS), [nilfs](http://nilfs.sourceforge.net/en/)... Then you avoid both problems \\- you can just create a snapshot and copy from it by rsync having full atomicity. Note however that such filesystem often tend to be experimental.\n\nAs a last note \\- `dd` might not be a best way of backup. It copies a full disk which is often wasteful as you copy the 'garbage' as well. If you need to have a disk images something like [partimage](http://www.partimage.org/Main_Page) might be better. If you don't a better option is using either using a rsync, tar in differential/incremental mode etc. or a full backup system such as [bacula](http://blog.bacula.org/), [tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/index.html) or one of many others.

The other options (A, B, and D) are all valid methods for creating consistent backups of live filesystems.\n\nOption A involves freezing the filesystem to prevent changes during the backup. Option B uses LVM snapshots to create a point-in-time copy. Option D leverages filesystems with built-in snapshot features.

Then the next step is developing efficient/fast inference/learning algorithm based on this statistical model. So I want to ask which statistical model is behind the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can often write a model that corresponds to a loss function (here I'm going to talk about SVM regression rather than SVM\\-classification; it's particularly simple)\n\nFor example, in a linear model, if your loss function is $\\\\sum\\_i g(\\\\varepsilon\\_i) \\= \\\\sum\\_i g(y\\_i\\-x\\_i'\\\\beta)$ then minimizing that will correspond to maximum likelihood for $f\\\\propto \\\\exp(\\-a\\\\,g(\\\\varepsilon))$ $\\= \\\\exp(\\-a\\\\,g(y\\-x'\\\\beta))$. (Here I have a linear kernel)\n\nIf I recall correctly SVM\\-regression has a loss function like this:\n\n[![plot of epsilon-insensitive loss](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Gxao.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Gxao.png)\n\nThat corresponds to a density that is uniform in the middle with exponential tails (as we see by exponentiating its negative, or some multiple of its negative).\n\n[![plot of corresponding density](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBl57.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBl57.png)\n\nThere's a 3 parameter family of these: corner\\-location (relative insensitivity threshold) plus location and scale.\n\nIt's an interesting density; if I recall rightly from looking at that particular distribution a few decades ago, a good estimator for location for it is the average of two symmetrically\\-placed quantiles corresponding to where the corners are (e.g. [midhinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhinge) would give a good approximation to MLE for one particular choice of the constant in the SVM loss); a similar estimator for the scale parameter would be based on their difference, while the third parameter corresponds basically to working out which percentile the corners are at (this might be chosen rather than estimated as it often is for SVM).\n\nSo at least for SVM regression it seems pretty straightforward, at least if we're choosing to get our estimators by maximum likelihood.\n\n(In case you're about to ask ... I have no reference for this particular connection to SVM: I just worked that out now.

Higher values will increase aggressiveness, lower values\ndecrease the amount of swap.\n\n```\n\nHowever this is kind of vague. I'm trying to figure out exactly what the parameter ultimately controls. I know it adjusts how aggressively the kernel tries to swap out pages, but what decision making process in the kernel code does it affect?\n\nDoes it adjust how long ago a page must have been accessed before the kernel swaps it out? If so what does the default value of 60 represent? And how much is changed by a increment/decrement of 1 (a formula would be nice)?  \n\nOr does it swap out pages based on their access frequency?  \n\nOr something else?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since kernel version 2\\.6\\.28, Linux uses a [Split Least Recently Used](http://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign \"Page Replacement Design\") (LRU) page replacement strategy. Pages with a filesystem source, such as program text or shared libraries belong to the file cache. Pages without filesystem backing are called anonymous pages, and consist of runtime data such as the stack space reserved for applications etc. Typically pages belonging to the file cache are cheaper to evict from memory (as these can simple be read back from disk when needed). Since anonymous pages have no filesystem backing, they must remain in memory as long as they are needed by a program unless there is swap space to store them to. \n\nThe [`vm.swappiness`](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt \"Kernel tree documentation for /proc/sys/vm/*\") option comes into play in `get_scan_count()` defined in `mm/vmscan.c`. `get_scan_count()` determines how aggressively the anonymous and file LRU lists should be scanned when looking for pages to evict. The value of each case is is determined by the floating average of recently rotated and recently scanned ratios where more recent references have more weight than older ones in order take into account the changing workload of the system.\n\nThe `vm.swappiness` is a modifier that changes the balance between swapping out file cache pages in favour of anonymous pages. `vm.swappiness` is the priority value given to anonymous pages, [by default set to 60](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88693/why-is-swappiness-set-to-60-by-default/88820 \"Why is swappiness set to 60 by default?\"). The file cache is given an priority value of 200 from which the `vm.swappiness` modifier is deducted (`file_prio=200-anon_prio`). This means that, by default, the priority weights stand moderately in favour of anonymous pages (`anon_prio=60`, `file_prio=200-60=140`). However, when the system is close to an [out\\-of\\-memory condition](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87732/linux-reboot-out-of-memory/87769#87769 \"Linux reboot out of memory\"), the both anonymous and file LRU lists are scanned equally, unless `vm.swappiness` is set to zero. \n\nWhen `vm.swappiness` is set to 100, the priorities would be equal (`anon_prio=100`, `file_prio=200-100=100`). Setting `vm.swappiness` to zero will prevent the kernel from evicting anonymous pages in favour of pages from the file cache."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Linux kernel's page replacement strategy, what is the primary function of the vm.swappiness parameter?\n\nA) It directly controls how long a page must be inactive before being swapped out\nB) It determines the absolute number of file cache pages to be swapped out\nC) It modifies the priority balance between swapping out file cache pages and anonymous pages\nD) It sets a hard limit on the maximum amount of swap space that can be used\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The vm.swappiness parameter modifies the priority balance between swapping out file cache pages and anonymous pages. It doesn't directly control inactivity time (A), set absolute numbers of pages to swap (B), or limit swap space usage (D). \n\nSpecifically, vm.swappiness is subtracted from a base priority of 200 for file cache pages, while being used directly as the priority for anonymous pages. This creates a weighted system that influences how aggressively each type of page is considered for swapping. The default value of 60 gives a slight preference to keeping anonymous pages in memory (60 priority for anonymous vs. 140 for file cache), while a value of 100 would make them equal priority."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/24", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/198142", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/90325/"], "docs_id": 198142, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to know that why is damn considered a swear word while dang and darn are never considered swear words. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your confusion likely comes from seeing all three of these words used as expletives. When someone is upset, they might say any of these three words, and yet **Damn** is considered very offensive, while the other two are considered less so. (**Darn** and **Dang** are still never used in formal English)\n\nThis is because **Damn** is considered a swear word in English, for historical and religious reasons (as SamBC mentioned earlier). When you want to say a swear word, but don't want to be offensive, people create \"[Minced Oaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minced_oath)\". A minced oath is created by changing one or more sounds of the swear word, but not so much that a native speaker can't tell that it's been changed. The words are similar *enough* that the intent is conveyed without actually saying the offensive word in question.\n\nEnglish has many swear words. English has many MORE minced oaths in order to avoid saying the swear word. For any given swear word, there is likely at least one, if not dozens of minced oath versions of that swear word.\n\nWhat makes a word a swear word? Culture. Typically religious taboos and gross violations of social norms. Swear words vary from language to language and culture to culture, and even within a single language you might find some regions consider a word more or less offensive than another region. (For instance, **Cunt** is considered *extremely* and *excessively* offensive in America, to the point where it's almost *never used* even by coarser types of people, while in England and Australia it might be considered a mild swear at worst, or even simply a casual word causing no offense outside of formal situations)\n\nWhat makes a minced oath acceptable? The fact that it is not the original word. That said, be careful of your audience, as *SOME* groups and individuals consider *some* minced oaths to be as bad as the original swear. For example, if someone is offended by the use of **Jesus** as a swear, **Jeebus** (a minced version) may still be offensive, yet **Jiminy Cricket** (a slightly archaic minced version of the same) could be acceptable.\n\nWhat makes a minced oath understandable? The fact that it sounds similar to the original word without sounding more similar to any other word. (This is why typically only native speakers can make new minced oaths... your working vocabulary has to be large enough to know that your minced oath isn't more similar to a different word instead)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the relationship between \"damn\" and its minced oath versions \"dang\" and \"darn\"?\n\nA) \"Dang\" and \"darn\" are considered more offensive than \"damn\" in formal settings.\n\nB) \"Damn\" is a minced oath derived from \"dang\" and \"darn\" to make it less offensive.\n\nC) \"Dang\" and \"darn\" are minced oaths created to convey the intent of \"damn\" without using the actual swear word.\n\nD) \"Damn\", \"dang\", and \"darn\" are all equally offensive in most English-speaking cultures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. \"Dang\" and \"darn\" are examples of minced oaths, which are created by altering the sounds of a swear word (in this case, \"damn\") to convey the same intent without actually using the offensive word. This allows speakers to express themselves similarly without violating social or religious taboos associated with the original swear word.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \"dang\" and \"darn\" are generally considered less offensive than \"damn\", not more offensive.\n\nAnswer B reverses the relationship; \"damn\" is the original swear word, not a minced oath derived from the others.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is a clear difference in the level of offensiveness between \"damn\" and its minced oath versions \"dang\" and \"darn\" in most English-speaking cultures."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/06/30", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/141354", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/87220/"], "docs_id": 141354, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a house built in 2000\\.

(And obviously we want the performance of the cached plan, so `WITH RECOMPILE` is out)\n\nThe exception here is that if there is ALSO at least one MANDATORY filter on the query which is HIGHLY selective and properly indexed, in addition to the optional parameters, then the above PROC will perform fine.\n\nHowever, if ALL the filters are optional, the rather awful truth is that parameterized dynamic sql actually performs better (unless you write N! different static PROCS for each permutation of optional parameters). \n\nDynamic SQL like the below will create and cache a different plan for each permutation of the Query parameters, but at least each plan will be 'tailored' to the specific query (it doesn't matter whether it is a PROC or Adhoc SQL \\- as long as they are parameterized queries, they will be cached)\n\nSo hence my preference for :\n\n```\nDECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX)        \n\n-- Mandatory / Static part of the Query here\nSET @SQL = N'SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE 1 = 1'\n\nIF @OptionalParam1 IS NOT NULL        \n    BEGIN        \n        SET @SQL = @SQL + N' AND MyColumn1 = @optionalParam1'    \n    END        \n\nIF @OptionalParam2 IS NOT NULL        \n    BEGIN        \n        SET @SQL = @SQL + N' AND MyColumn2 = @optionalParam2'    \n    END        \n\nEXEC sp_executesql @SQL,        \n    N'@optionalParam1 NVARCHAR(50), \n      @optionalParam2 INT'\n    ,@optionalParam1 = @optionalParam1\n    ,@optionalParam2 = @optionalParam2\n\n```\n\netc. It doesn't matter if we pass in redundant parameters into `sp_executesql` \\- they are ignored.\nIt is worth noting that ORM's like Linq2SQL and EF use parameterized dynamic sql in a similar way.\n\nThe awful `1 == 1` hack can also be avoided if you keep track of whether any predicates have yet been applied or not, and then conditionally apply the first `AND` only on the second and subsequent predicates. If there are no predicates at all, then `WHERE` disappears as well.\n\nNote that despite the dynamic query, we are still `parameterizing` the filters, if present, so we have at least a first line of defence against SQL Injection attacks."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When implementing a filtered search form for a large SQL Server table with multiple optional search parameters, which approach is most likely to provide the best performance?\n\nA) Create a stored procedure with a single query using OR conditions for each optional parameter (e.g., WHERE (@param1 IS NULL OR column1 = @param1))\n\nB) Create a stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL based on which parameters are provided, using sp_executesql to execute the final query\n\nC) Create separate stored procedures for each possible combination of search parameters\n\nD) Use a single stored procedure with all possible parameters and add WITH RECOMPILE option\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A, while simple, can lead to poor performance as SQL Server may cache an execution plan that's not optimal for all parameter combinations. \n\nOption B, using dynamic SQL within a stored procedure, allows SQL Server to generate and cache optimized execution plans for each unique combination of parameters.

Problem is, I really don't get any usable information from knowing `StartFlying` is IFly type. However, knowing that `StartFlying` is a function inside Airplane and Bird, is more informative, as I can decide which instance (Airplane or Bird ) to use. \n\nAny lights on this: how saying `StartFlying` is a function of type IFly, can help a programmer understanding how to use the function?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think your confusion comes from the fact that you named your interface `IFly`. Any recent programming book recommends to **not** name your interfaces with **I** in front. Give your interface a proper name.\n\nIn your particular example it would be a little bit harder to do this, but let's take this situation:\n\n* Interface is: `FlyingObject`\n* Implementation1: `Airplane implements FlyingObject`\n* Implementation2: `Helicopter implements FlyingObject`\n* Implementation3: `UFO implements FlyingObject`\n\nIf you do this and you try to write a documentation for it, it will be quite clear what `StartFlying on FlyingObject` means.\n\nIn some extreme cases, when it's impossible to find the proper abstraction, you may name your interface with a concrete name like `Foo` and than the implementation `FooImplementation` or `FooImpl`.\n\n**UPDATE:** Of course it always depends on what you are documenting and how. If you document your business logic, you can simply say that any `FlyingObject` has a `startFlying()` method. Your business logic will not create those objects, so you don't care what are they exactly. In fact, this makes things much more clearer once you document that your business logic can use any object that has the `startFlying()` method and you connect that knowledge to the interface. You don't care who creates the `Airplane` or `Helicopter`. All you know and document from the point of view of the business logic is that you can start flying if you have an object capable doing so.\n\nOn the other hand if you document your factories or whatever logic you have that decides what type of flying object to create, there you can document something like 'Airplane, Helicopter, etc. must implement FlyingObject, otherwise they can't take you to Japan'. \n\nI hope this update clarifies all the question you were asking."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented programming, when designing an interface for flying objects and its implementations, which of the following approaches is considered best practice according to modern programming guidelines?\n\nA) Create an interface called IFly, with implementations like Airplane and Bird.\n\nB) Create an interface called FlyingObject, with implementations like Airplane and Helicopter.\n\nC) Create a base class called FlyingThing, with subclasses like Plane and Avian.\n\nD) Create separate classes for each flying object without using interfaces or inheritance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it follows modern programming guidelines for interface design. The documentation specifically mentions that recent programming books recommend not naming interfaces with \"I\" in front, which eliminates option A. Instead, giving interfaces proper, descriptive names (like FlyingObject) is preferred. This approach makes the purpose of the interface clearer and allows for more intuitive implementation names (Airplane, Helicopter, etc.).\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests using inheritance with a base class, which is not the same as using interfaces and may not provide the same level of flexibility. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't utilize the benefits of interfaces or inheritance, which are important concepts in object-oriented programming for creating abstraction and promoting code reuse.\n\nThe approach in option B also aligns with the documentation's emphasis on clear abstraction and how it helps in writing more understandable and maintainable code, especially when documenting business logic that interacts with these objects."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16708917", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/912588/"], "docs_id": 16708917, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can anyone guide me to how do I include variables in my VagrantFile?

It would also be less flexible for distributing configurations to colleagues compared to the YAML file approach.\n\nThe YAML approach (B) provides a clean separation of configuration from code, makes it easy to maintain different configurations (e.g., 'home' and 'office'), and allows for simple distribution and modification of configs without altering the Vagrantfile."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/19", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/210349", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/90086/"], "docs_id": 210349, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know how to record with OBS, but when I try to record my League of Legends games, the video just turns black with only the mouse icon seen.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recording or streaming League of Legends is somewhat tricky. The game uses 2 different windows: one for the client and one for the game. \n\nThe easiest way to stream/record League of Legends is by running the game in (borderless) windowed mode. \n\nNow depending on whether you want to just record the game or the game and the client you might want to use the [**OBS Scene Switcher Plugin**](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/simple-scene-switcher.12616/). This plugin allows you to automatically switch to the right scene when changing your focus. However If you're only interested in recording the game it's not necessary.\n\nFor the game recording itself you just have to add a scene with **window capture**. The window you have to select in order to stream or record the game is called **League of Legends (TM) Client**. If you have done this you should be able to record your games. \n\nI would also recommend saving these settings in your scene collection since it's really annoying to configure these settings all over again if you have to restart the program."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to record League of Legends gameplay using OBS, which of the following is the most effective method to ensure proper capture of the game?\n\nA) Use display capture and select the entire screen\nB) Use game capture and select League of Legends\nC) Use window capture and select \"League of Legends (TM) Client\"\nD) Use scene collection and select League of Legends\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) Use window capture and select \"League of Legends (TM) Client\". According to the documentation, League of Legends uses two different windows: one for the client and one for the game. The most reliable method to capture the game is by using window capture in OBS and specifically selecting the window titled \"League of Legends (TM) Client\". This ensures that OBS captures the correct window, avoiding the black screen issue mentioned in the original question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because display capture might capture unnecessary elements and could cause performance issues. Option B is incorrect because game capture might not work reliably with League of Legends due to its dual-window structure. Option D is incorrect because scene collection is a feature for saving settings, not a capture method.\n\nAdditionally, the documentation recommends running the game in (borderless) windowed mode for easier capture, and suggests using the OBS Scene Switcher Plugin for more advanced setups involving both the client and the game."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/04/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/164269", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/39212/"], "docs_id": 164269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Having access to those references, accumulating many results in one domain is always a bless, like Feller's book in probability, Dembo\\-Zeitouni's large deviation, Grimmett's percolation and recent Optimal Transport of Villani. \n\nThere are variants of asymptotic results in probability theory: law of large numbers, central limit theorem and laws of iterated logarithm.
