The output of this device is bursts of frequency around 50kHz, with an envelope of 100Hz and RMS 15Volt measured by scope. \n\nUnder these conditions, why does the diode become extremely hot even with a pure ohmic load that requires just 120mA? \n\nAlso, what is the effect is we are use a fast\\-diode to rectify a low frequency waveform i.e. 50\\~160Hz.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every diode needs some time to recover its reverse resistance after voltage polarity changes. During the recovery time there is high reverse current through the diode. This reverse current makes the diode to produce some heat.\nThe higher the frequency is, the more time is spent in the recovery state and so the more heat is produced by the reverse\\-recovery process. Low\\-frequency diodes (like 1N4007\\) have relatively long reverse recovery time, and you've seen what it leads to. Higher\\-frequency diodes (like HER or FR series, for example) have much shorter recovery time which allows them to operate at about 300 kHz.\nUsing a high frequency diode to rectify a low\\-frequency waveform will produce even less heat by reverse\\-recovery than in case with a low\\-frequency diode, but in both cases it will be negligable to heating by forward\\-current. So the only drawback of using a high\\-frequency diode to rectify a low\\-frequency waveform is the diode's price."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a rectifier circuit for an electronic transformer with the following output characteristics:\n- Frequency bursts around 50 kHz\n- Envelope of 100 Hz\n- RMS voltage of 15V measured by oscilloscope\n- Load current of 120 mA\n\nThe engineer initially used a 1N4007 diode, which became extremely hot. Based on this information and diode behavior, answer the following:\n\n1. What is the primary reason for the 1N4007 diode overheating in this application?\n2. Which type of diode would be more suitable for this circuit?\n3. If a high-frequency diode is used in a low-frequency (50-160 Hz) rectifier circuit instead, what would be the main consequence?\n\nA) 1. Excessive forward current\n   2. Schottky diode\n   3. Significantly increased power consumption\n\nB) 1. Long reverse recovery time\n   2. Fast recovery diode (e.g., HER or FR series)\n   3. Higher component cost with negligible performance impact\n\nC) 1. Insufficient voltage rating\n   2. Zener diode\n   3. Reduced rectification efficiency\n\nD) 1. High junction capacitance\n   2. PIN diode\n   3. Increased electromagnetic interference (EMI)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n1. The primary reason for the 1N4007 diode overheating is its long reverse recovery time. At high frequencies (50 kHz in this case), the diode spends more time in the recovery state, leading to higher reverse current and heat generation.\n\n2. A fast recovery diode, such as those from the HER or FR series, would be more suitable. These diodes have much shorter recovery times, allowing them to operate efficiently at frequencies up to about 300 kHz.\n\n3. Using a high-frequency diode in a low-frequency rectifier circuit would result in higher component cost but with negligible performance impact. The fast recovery characteristics would produce even less heat during reverse recovery than a low-frequency diode, but at low frequencies, this difference is minimal compared to the heating caused by forward current."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/15", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/226001", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/63517/"], "docs_id": 226001, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have one bigger website it has lot's of products, orders and customers.\n\nI have to export database without products, orders and customers.\nAnd have to import database in my local machine.\n\nI follow this command to export data. this example for single table only.\n\n> mysqldump \\-u root \\-p database\n>  \\-\\-ignore\\-table\\=database.frst\\_catalogrule\\_product \\> export.sql\n> \n> \n> mysqldump \\-u root \\-p database \\-\\-no\\-data frst\\_catalogrule\\_product \\>\\>\n>  export.sql\n\nNow my question is \n\n> How many tables are effected for product,orders and\n>  customer?

"answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer needs to export a Magento database without including product, order, and customer data. Which of the following MySQL commands would be most appropriate to accomplish this task?\n\nA) mysqldump -u root -p database --ignore-table=database.catalog_product_entity --ignore-table=database.sales_order --ignore-table=database.customer_entity > export.sql\n\nB) mysqldump -u root -p database --exclude-table-data=catalog_product_entity --exclude-table-data=sales_order --exclude-table-data=customer_entity > export.sql\n\nC) mysqldump -u root -p database --no-data catalog_product_entity sales_order customer_entity >> export.sql\n\nD) mysqldump -u root -p database $(mysql -N -u root -p database -e \"SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME NOT LIKE 'catalog_%' AND TABLE_NAME NOT LIKE 'sales_%' AND TABLE_NAME NOT LIKE 'customer_%'\") > export.sql\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate command for this task. The --exclude-table-data option allows the developer to export the database structure for the specified tables without including their data. This approach ensures that the schema for product, order, and customer tables is included in the export, but without the actual data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it completely ignores the specified tables, excluding both their structure and data.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it only exports the structure of the three specified tables, but doesn't handle related tables or other data in the database.\n\nOption D is a creative approach using a subquery, but it's overly complex and may exclude too many tables based on naming conventions, potentially missing important data not directly related to products, orders, or customers."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/25", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/192439", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/106699/"], "docs_id": 192439, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I use the result of a find command in an if statement and compare with true or false?\n\nSomething like this: \n\n```\nif [ `find . -name test.txt -size 156c`=\"true\" ]; then echo Found; fi\n\n```\n\nThis is the whole script:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ $# -ne 2 ]\nthen\n    echo Not enough params\nfi\n\nif [ `find . -name $1 -size $2c | grep -q .` -eq 0 ]\nthen\n    echo OK\nfi  \n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Perhaps simply piping the output of `find` into `grep` would do the trick:\n\n```\nif find . -name test.txt -size 156c | grep -q .; then echo Found; fi\n\n```\n\nThe call to `find` will have no output unless a file matching the name and size conditions you set is found, and `grep .` will have exit status 0 (\"true\") only if its input is non\\-empty.

The Chow group a la Fulton.\n\n**2**. The classical Grothendieck group of vector bundles or coherent sheaves.\n\n**3**. The $\\\\gamma$\\-graded Grothendieck group.\n\nI was just wondering where the idea of \"the splitting principle\" comes from. I'm guessing somewhere in topology when one wanted to define Chern classes and show some properties. But I don't know.\n\nAnd above that, is there some more general way of looking at this? I know there is a theorem that connects higher K\\-groups with Chow groups in a sense. So I ask, is there a way of deducing the splitting principle for one of the above objects from the other? (It's easy if we want to do this modulo torsion, of course.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can think of the splitting principle as a *condition* on a \"cohomology theory\" (of some sort) $E^\\*$, coming about when working with Chern classes for instance, and then ask: When does $E^\\*$ satisfy this condition? First, let's make the condition more precise and reformulate it:\n\n**Condition 1:** Given $X$ and a vector bundle $V$ on $X$, there exists $f: X' \\\\to X$ such that $f^\\* V'$ has a filtration with subquotients line bundles, and $f^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(X')$ is injective.\n\nBut there is a *universal* choice for $X'$, namely the *flag variety of $V$*: $p: Fl(V) \\\\to X$. Any $f: X' \\\\to X$ with $f^\\* V'$ filtered with line bundle subquotients will factor through $p$, and so we're really just asking if $p^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V))$ is injective.\n\n**Condition 1':** For all $X$ and $V$, $p^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V))$ is injective.\n\nAt this point there are two ways this answer can go, depending on ones tastes:\n\n1. $Fl(V)$ is a very geometric object over $X$, so we might as well ask that we actually have a formula for $E^\\*(Fl(V))$ in terms of $E^\\*(X)$. If $E^\\*$ is \"reasonable\" (i.e., has Chern classes giving rise to a \"projective bundle formula\") then iteratively applying the projective bundle formula will give such a thing, and in fact show that $E^\\*(X)$ is a direct summand of $E^\\*(Fl(V))$.\n2. (My favorite:) There's a nice way of strengthening Condition 1' that also holds in all reasonable cases, and that looks rather natural. You can ask that $Fl(V) \\\\to X$ behave like a \"covering\", i.e. that\n(**Condition 2:**)\n$$ E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V)) \\\\to E^\\*\\\\left(Fl(V) \\\\times\\_X Fl(V)\\\\right) $$\nis an equalizer diagram.

(Though this second approach is not so great, since those relationships hold under much more stringent hypotheses than are necessary to run the argument.)\n\nOne could also ask to generalize this in another direction, replacing vector bundles and $Fl(V)$ by more general $G$\\-bundles and their associated $G/B$\\-bundles.

Nevertheless, I will leave the question as stated in case it continues to receive interesting answers.\n\n### Justification\n\nThis coming academic year I will be supervising a fourth\\-year undergraduate project on Category Theory. As should be clear to MO regulars, I'm far from an expert in this topic, but I am keen to improve my fluency in this language: hence the project.\n\nMaybe it's only me, but I find that the unifying beauty of category theory can best be appreciated when one has lots of concrete (not necessarily in the categorical sense!) examples. Most books I've seen take this view as well and present a number of examples taken from algebra and topology, mostly. Given the origins of the subject, this is of course not surprising. From time to time, though, I find myself wanting more \"realistic\" examples for certain concepts. This question is about one such concept.\n\n### Background\n\nRecall that a *bimorphism* in a category is a morphism which is both monic (i.e., left cancellable) and epic (i.e., right cancellable). A closely related notion to (and, in a concrete category, a special case of) bimorphism is that of isomorphism: a morphism $f:A \\\\to B$ is an isomorphism if there exists a morphism $f^{\\-1}: B \\\\to A$ such that $f \\\\circ f^{\\-1} \\= 1\\_B$ and $f^{\\-1} \\\\circ f \\= 1\\_A$, with $1\\_{A,B}$ the corresponding identity morphisms. Categories in which all bimorphisms are isomorphisms are said to be *balanced*.\n\nWe say that two objects $A,B$ in a category are isomorphic if $\\\\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ contains an isomorphism. Now, if the category is not balanced, it could very well be that $\\\\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ contains a bimorphism even if it does not contain an isomorphism. For lack of a better name, let us call such objects *bimorphic* and let us speak of bimorphism classes of objects,...\n\nNeedless to say, the concept of isomorphism classes is very important and sits at the centre of any classification problem, but what about the concept of bimorphism classes?\n\n### Question\n\nIs there a natural context in which one is compelled to relax the notion of isomorphism to that of bimorphism? In particular, any geometric context?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to be deliberately provocative and say that I don't really know of *any* use for the concept of bimorphism as such. (I also don't really like the name; it sounds to me like something that's both a morphism and a comorphism.)\n\nOne use that's been proposed is \"to find situations in which bimorphism \u21d2 isomorphism.\" Such situations may be interesting, but as far as I can tell they are rarely (if ever) used. What seems to happen much more often is that we have some factorization system (E,M) and we use the fact that E\\+M\\=iso, which is true for any factorization system. The most common case is probably (extremal epi, mono), followed perhaps by (epi, extremal mono); both of these are factorization systems as soon as the relevant factorizations exist.\n\nIt might *happen*, in some case, that E consists of exactly the epimorphisms and M of exactly the monomorphisms (such as when all epis, or all monos, are extremal). But as far as I can tell this fact \\-\\- especially the epi part of it \\-\\- is hardly ever relevant, because in practice it's quite hard to characterize the epis in a given category or to check that a given morphism is epi, nor is the answer often especially meaningful. Since monadic functors also create limits, and in particular monomorphisms, a morphism in a category monadic over Set is monic iff it is injective \\-\\- but this is not true for epis, and even in quite nice categories the epis can be fairly bizarre. It's usually the extremal epis which coincide with the \"surjections\" and form a factorization system with the monos.\n\nFor instance, Andrew cited vector spaces as an example of a balanced category. But as I pointed out in my comment, do we ever use that fact? What we actually teach our undergraduates is that injective\\+surjective\\=iso for vector spaces; we (or, at least, I) don't tell them anything about why surjective\\=epi, or even what epi means. And when doing linear algebra, I might occasionally use the fact that surjections are in particular epi (which just follows because the forgetful functor to Set is faithful), but never the converse. It's just as true for groups, rings, fields, monoids, etc. that injective\\+surjective\\=iso, and we use that fact in doing algebra all the time \\-\\- but does the non\\-surjective ring epimorphism Z \u2192 Q, showing that rings (unlike vector spaces) are not balanced, ever actually bother us in practice?\n\nIn the topological situation, it's true that the epimorphisms in Top are precisely the surjective continuous maps. But does that fact really help you when looking for conditions ensuring that a continuous bijection is an isomorphism, or using that fact in practice? Odds are the property of a continuous bijection you're going to use is that it's continuous and a bijection, not that it's monic and epic in the category Top.\n\nThe categorical version of \"continuous bijection in Top\" is \"inverted by the forgetful functor to Set,\" and I think that in general the property of \"being inverted by a forgetful functor\" is quite interesting and important. For instance, a forgetful functor with the property that any morphism inverted by it is already an isomorphism is called *conservative*, and these include all monadic functors. The question about all the different topologies one can put on a given set also seems to me to really be about morphisms inverted by the forgetful functor; is it really important here that continuous surjections are the epis in Top? I expect that if you modify the definition of Top a little, then it may no longer be true that epis coincide with continuous surjections, and in that case I bet that it is the continuous surjections which are of more interest.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the most interesting thing I know about bimorphisms is that they often form the middle class of a [ternary factorization system](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/07/ternary_factorization_systems.html).

The author argues that factorization systems (like extremal epi and mono) and properties related to forgetful functors (such as being conservative) are more commonly used and meaningful in practice.

The compiler / runtime is free to choose *how* to calculate it, and optimize as it sees fit. Thanks to Linq this same code will run efficiently whether run an a list in memory, or if the list is in a database.

This standard is 600 \u03a9. All \"line level\" audio in such a setup is expected to drive 600 \u03a9. This is also the impedance of the microphones.\n\nHowever, many many amps don't follow this. In fact, most amps try to be \"high\", which means to not appreciably load the output stage of whatever they think is producing the signal. Of course everyone's idea of \"high\" is different. The most common is probably around 10 k\u03a9.\n\nThat's what I've done with audio gear aimed at consumers. Anything that produces a consumer audio signal won't be damaged, loaded to the point of distortion, or even appreciably attenuated by 10 k\u03a9.

For consumer-grade audio amplifiers, a relatively high input impedance of around 10 k\u03a9 is often used. This high impedance serves several purposes:\n\n1.

I'm using two projects here to debug; 1\\.climvar and 2\\.usaid. If I load up climvar after restarting Tomcat my wfs features display. If I load up climvar after restarting Tomcat, BUT visit usaid first, no wfs features display. I looked at the responses in more detail.

There is no difference between the request payloads. In the unsuccessful response, all the prefixes are null.

In GeoServer, both workspaces have the namespaces set correctly, both are enabled, both have WFS enabled.

Therefore, $$\\\\angle COE\\=2\\\\cdot 72^\\\\circ\\=144^\\\\circ\\=3\\\\cdot 48^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$ Since $COE$ is an isosceles triangle, we have\n$$\\\\angle OCE\\=\\\\angle OEC\\=18^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\n\nAs $CDE$ is an isoscels triangle with $\\\\angle CDE\\=108^\\\\circ$, we conclude that $$\\\\angle DCE\\=\\\\angle DEC\\=36^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$ Because $\\\\angle FCD\\=\\\\angle FED\\=42^\\\\circ$, we obtain\n$$\\\\angle FCE\\=\\\\angle FEC\\=6^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\nTherefore, $FC$ and $FE$ are angular trisectors of the triangle $COE$.\n\nLet the angular bisector of $\\\\angle FCO$ meet the circumcircle of the triangle $BOC$ at $P$. Then, $\\\\angle OCP\\=6^\\\\circ$, so that $$\\\\angle OBP\\=\\\\angle OCP\\=6^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\nBecause $\\\\angle BOC\\=72^\\\\circ$ and $BOC$ is an isosceles triangle, we have\n$$\\\\angle OCB\\=\\\\angle OBC\\=54^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\nErgo,\n$$\\\\angle COP\\=\\\\angle PBC\\=\\\\angle OBC\\-\\\\angle OBP\\=54^\\\\circ\\-6^\\\\circ\\=48^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\n\nBy symmetry, if $Q$ is the image of reflection of $P$ with respect to the line $OD$, then $$\\\\angle EOQ\\=48^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$ Therefore, $OP$ and $OQ$ trisect $\\\\angle COE$. Moreover, $CF$ and $CP$ trisect $\\\\angle OCE$, and $EF$ and $EQ$ trisect $\\\\angle OEC$. By Morley's Trisector Theorem, $FPQ$ is an equilateral triangle.\n\nBy symmetry, $OP\\=OQ$.

Similarly, $Q$ lies on $FA$. Thus,\n$$\\\\angle AFB\\=\\\\angle PFQ\\=60^\\\\circ\\\\,.$$\n\n---\n\nIf you do not wish to invoke Morley's Trisector Theorem, you can still prove that $FPQ$ is an equilateral triangle.

The claim is that thanks to \"an advanced technology\" the battery life in those watches is extended to ten years.\n\nNow if you look at different models you see that they are rather complicated hence likely energy consuming \\- for example, [AW\\-80\\-1AV model](https://www.casio.com/products/watches/sports/aw80-1av) has both a liquid crystal display and hands and also it has LED illumination and a sound alarm.\n\nI first thought that maybe the battery is the key. Model AW\\-80\\-1AV runs on CR2025\\. Energizer CR2025 datasheet specifies that this battery has nominal output voltage of 3 volts and nominal capacity of 163 mAh, so it stores 0,489 volt\\-ampere\\-hours of energy.\n\nFor comparison, typical basic model of Swatch run about three years on Renata silver oxide 390 (SR1130SW) battery that has nominal output voltage of 1,55 volts and nominal capacity of 60 mAh and so stores 0,093 volt\\-ampere\\-hours of energy.\n\nSo CR2025 stores about five times more energy, but the basic model of Swatch only has hands \\- no digital display, no illumination, no alarm, so it likely consumes less energy.\n\nThere clearly must be something more than a bigger battery that makes 10 years battery life possible.\n\nHow is 10 years battery life possible in a rather energy consuming wristwatch?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 10 years \\=\\~ 87650 hours.  \n\n 1 uA drain will require 87\\.75 mAh in 10 years.  \n\n With som shelf life degradation that's close enough to  \n\n \\= 10 mAh / uA / year or  \n\n \\= 100 mAh / uA / 10 years \n\nSo your cited 163 mAh battery will supply 1\\.63 uA mean.  \n\n Pushing technology, size and luck may get you to say 5 uA mean.\n\nThere are 86400 seconds/day. \nThere are 1440 minutes/day.\n\nYou will find that eg alarm use is much restricted in the allowable use to get 10 years. If 1 uA of the drain is for alarm use then you get 24 uA.hr/day or 86400 uA.seconds or 86 mA.seconds. That's about 240 mW seconds at 3 V. Or say 5 x 50 mW x 1 second burst/day.\n\nAn LED can provide ample lighting at 1 mA. Use it 5 times/day x 1 second \\= 5 mA.sec \\= 5000 uA.sec or \"only\" 5000/86400 \\= 0\\.06 uA mean drain. Increase as desired and allowed.\n\nCan you run a time keeping IC on say 1 uA?  \n\nProbably yes.\n\nSo overall it all falls in the area of \"notionally possible if really really really clever and careful\".  \n\n Casio can be expected to be quite clever by now.\n\nNote that if any sort of energy harvesting is being used then all bets are on.

Option B correctly identifies the main strategies:\n\n1. Implementing deep sleep modes: The documentation mentions that microcontrollers like the EFM32 can operate in deep sleep (EM2) mode, consuming as little as 1 \u03bcA while still maintaining essential functions like timekeeping.\n\n2. Using energy-efficient peripherals: Low-power components such as LCD displays and RTC (Real-Time Clock) are mentioned as being operational in low-power modes.\n\n3. Limiting high-power functions: The answer notes that features like alarms and LED illumination must be used sparingly to maintain long battery life.\n\nOption A would consume far too much power for a 10-year battery life.

You had copper wires from a premise (office or home) to an exchange (initially manual, then automated), wires from exchange to exchange (possibly several), and again wires from the last exchange to the destination premises. Beyond some amplification and other treatments such as noise filtering or echo cancellation, it was the same original analog signal that was sent all the way through.\n\nNote that when you used modems, you sent a digital signal as analog, and it had to deal with the bad quality of an analog link and all the complications introduced by the systems that were meant to optimise voice, but could be a problem for digital.\n* then, in the core of the network, the links between the exchanges were replaced with digital links. The exchanges at both ends performed analog\\-to\\-digital and digital\\-to\\-analog conversion. The link between the user premises and the exchange was still analog, while in between the links were converted to digital.\n* ISDN is the extension of that digital conversion to the end\\-user premises. Use the same copper wires, but transmit digital signals on them, not analog. Digital/analog conversion is done on premises (depending on the exact architecture, it may be done by several different pieces of equipment).\n* the low\\-level technology of ISDN is DSL, by definition a \"Digital Subscriber Line\". BRI (T0\\) used very low speed DSL (144\\-160 kbit/s IIRC). PRI (T1/T2\\) higher speeds (1\\.5\\-2 Mbps). PRIs initially used special cabling (thicker wires, more shielding), but that was then replaced with SDSL which uses the old regular thin copper wiring that was original used for phone service.\n\nHowever, contrary to modern xDSL services, the core circuit\\-switched network of PSTN was still used. Yes, there was a little bit of packet\\-switched data possible on the D channel, but that remains minimal.\n* Further improvements to xDSL were introduced, including ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2\\+, VDSL, VDSL2\\... The principle is still the same: use the existing copper wiring (often decades old) between exchanges and customer premises, but with higher and higher speeds. The difference however is that instead of carrying (mostly) voice over switched circuits (the base of PSTN), data is carried which is packet\\-switched (IP) or cell\\-switched (back in the days of long\\-distance ATM).\n\nSo:\n\nPSTN \\= premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring \\+ circuit\\-switched exchange\\-to\\-exchange network.\n\nPOTS \\= analog voice service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring.\n\nISDN \\= digital service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring. Still using circuit\\-switched network.\n\nMost xDSL technologies: digital service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring, packet\\-switched network.\n\n```\nTech | End-user/Exchange | Long-distance network\n-----+-------------------+--------------------------\nPOTS | Analog            | Analog, circuit-switched\nPOTS | Analog            | Digital, circuit-switched\nISDN | Digital           | Digital, circuit-switched\nxDSL | Digital           | Digital, packet-switched\n\nPSTN = End-user/Exchange wiring + circuit-switched network.\n\n```\n\nTo answer your questions more specifically:\n\n* **How significant is PSTN today?** It's still used for all voice calls to/from a landline, and even mobile calls are mostly routed through the core of the PSTN\n* **How significant is POTS today?** Nearly all consumer landlines are POTS. Medium and large business use ISDN or VoIP. Some consumer landlines use VoIP (if you connect your phone to the back of your DSL or cable box it's VoIP).\n* **Is ISDN any relevant today?** For data (which was one of the primary selling points for ISDN in the consumer/SoHo market), it's probably as good as dead. For voice, it's used for medium/large businesses which haven't switched to VoIP yet.\n* **How significant is the PSTN today for internet connections?** Very very marginal.\n* **How significant is the PSTN today for telephone?** Still the backbone of the telephone system.\n* **Doesn't DSL use the PSTN?** Modern xDSL technologies use the \"last\\-mile\" part of the PSTN, the exchange\\-to\\-premises copper wiring, to carry data. But instead of having the line connected to a telephone exchange that does circuit\\-switching, it is connected to a modem in a DSLAM which is then connected (directly or indirectly) to the Internet."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the evolution of telecommunications technology?\n\nA) POTS uses digital signals from end-to-end, while ISDN uses analog signals for the last mile.\n\nB) PSTN refers only to the circuit-switched network between exchanges, not including the wiring to premises.\n\nC) Modern xDSL technologies use packet-switching for long-distance networks, while still utilizing the copper wiring of PSTN for the last mile.\n\nD) ISDN was developed to replace analog voice services and is still widely used for consumer internet connections today.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately describes how modern xDSL technologies work.

And most of it is correct, and you have covered everything you need to cover.\n\nThe biggest flaw is a detail at the start: You're phrasing it as though you're using regular (weak) induction, but it is necessary here to use (and you are indeed actually doing) strong induction.\n\nYou say\n\n> Assume that for some $m$ in $Z^\\+$ the statement is true. Now consider $m\\+1$.\n\nwhich is weak induction. But then, the assumption that you actually *use* is\n\n> Since $l\\=h\u00b72^k$\n\nwhich is not what you've assumed, as $l$ is not $m$. (Here you also ought to specify that $h$ is odd, for clarity, especially since that is the fact on which this whole proof hinges; it must be stated explicitly.)\n\nSo if you start your inductive step with\n\n> Assume that for some $m$ in $Z^\\+$ the statement is true for every positive integer less than or equal to $m$. Now consider $m\\+1$.\n\nand specify that $h$ is odd, then this will be a whole lot more correct."}, "answer": "Question: Which of the following statements best describes the key issue with the inductive approach presented in the original proof?\n\nA) The proof incorrectly assumes that the statement is true for all positive integers, rather than just for m.\n\nB) The proof fails to specify that h is an odd number, which is crucial for the validity of the argument.\n\nC) The proof uses weak induction instead of strong induction, which is insufficient for this particular problem.\n\nD) The proof incorrectly defines l as equal to m, leading to a logical inconsistency in the inductive step.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key issue identified in the feedback is that the proof attempts to use weak induction when strong induction is necessary. The original statement \"Assume that for some m in Z+ the statement is true. Now consider m+1\" indicates weak induction. However, the proof actually relies on the assumption being true for all positive integers up to and including m, which is characteristic of strong induction. This mismatch between the stated inductive approach and the actual reasoning used is the primary flaw in the proof structure.\n\nWhile option B is also mentioned as an important point (specifying that h is odd), it is not the main issue with the inductive approach itself.

We might need some more development help and are looking at an Indian company which comes recommended by someone we know (although they are not very technical).\n\nI'll be having an informal chat with them, and thought I'd see if people here had some wisdom regarding what to look for and good questions to ask.\n\nAt least I thought I'd try to get some:\n\n* Code examples\n* Info on any policies they might have regarding documentation of code\n* Some background on the people we will be working with\n\nIf you guys can think of anything else I should be particularly on the lookout for, or have any other tips to run the conversation, your input would be much appreciated!\n\n\\*\\* **Update** \\*\\*\n\nTo be clear: I have some about what questions to ask a sole developer/freelancer. In this instance I will be talking to a an Indian company offering outsourcing services. I'm curious to know whether there is any particular issues I should be aware of, and if someone with this kind of experience have any hard earned wisdom to share. See MainMa's answer for one such point, although it's not developer\\-specific.\n\nI see the title of the question has been slightly modified so it no longer correctly conveys what I was trying to ask.. maybe this was the wrong place for this question. :/\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think an interview with a developer off\\-shore must be very different from an interview with, say, a freelance developer from USA. After all, **you search for a person with the same profile and the same skills, doing the same tasks**.\n\nStill, I noticed personally and often read that Indian developers have a different approach of a relation with a customer. When you ask them to do something which doesn't make any sense or will be overly expensive or has a high risk of breaking something, they will still do it, instead of \\[politely] explaining to you that you're stupid and don't know what you're really asking.\n\nSince you're a developer, it may not bother you too much. If I were you, I would still talk to them about this point and how they approach it, in other words if they understand that it's better to say \"No\" to their customer than to implement something substantially broken.\n\n---\n\nMore generally, when you search for a developer, try to determine following things:\n\n* **Does the person have the right technical skills?**\n\nThis is done by asking the right questions, and depends a lot of the specific job. It may be something basic, as \"What is the difference between stack and queue? Which one do you use to replace a recursion and how?\" to something very advanced in a specific language.\n\nAsking to write code is a good idea (see Joel Test), but may be difficult in an interview by phone. You will feel stupid staying at phone waiting for twenty minutes for a person to solve a problem, and it will stress the interviewed person. You also cannot know if the person is actually solving the problem or asking for help on Stack Overflow.\n* **What about communication skills?**\n\nPartially you get the idea by talking to the person, but this may be not enough. Often written skill is more important, and you may want to ask if the person has a blog, a high\\-rep account on Stack Exchange, etc.\n* **Is the candidate THE candidate you want?**\n\nThis one is the most difficult to answer, and the risk of making a mistake is high (in both ways). Some questions you may ask include:\n\n\t+ In C\\#, do you use StyleCop? Code Analysis? Code Metrics? Can you talk a bit more about it?\n\t+ What are the five things/features you lack the most in your preferred programming language? How would you implement them?\n\t+ How much do you spend actually writing code? What do you do the rest of the time?\n\t+ Do you use Waterfall? Agile? Can you describe how do you use them?\n\t+ Why QA matters? Have you worked with testers? According to you, what do they do?\n\t+ If an end user asks you for support with a question you find completely stupid, how do you answer?\n\t+ Why the question \"Which language is better, PHP or Java?\" doesn't make sense?\n\t+ etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When interviewing an offshore development company, which of the following approaches is most advisable according to the top answer?\n\nA) Focus solely on technical skills and coding ability\nB) Prioritize communication skills over technical expertise\nC) Treat it the same as interviewing any other developer, while being aware of potential cultural differences\nD) Only ask about their policies and documentation practices\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that interviewing an offshore developer should not be fundamentally different from interviewing any other developer, as you are looking for the same skills and profile.

One of those aspects which is relevant to the linked post is when a feature\\-request is made.\n\nFeature\\-requests are actual requests that the SE team reviews to see if they should be implemented. As a result of the implications of implementing features, questions tagged with feature\\-request are voted on based on the feasibility of the feature on a per user basis.\n\nUsers who disagree with a feature\\-request indicate their disagreement with a downvote. Users who agree with a feature\\-request indicate their agreement with an upvote.\n\nAs for the downvotes, I hope that user did not get discouraged as it is not meant to be directed at them so much as at the feature itself.

They are used to indicate disagreement with the proposed feature, rather than to critique the quality of the post itself. This can be counter-intuitive to newcomers, but it's an established practice within the Meta community. Upvotes, conversely, indicate agreement with the proposed feature. This voting mechanism allows the Stack Exchange team to gauge community sentiment about potential new features or changes to the platform.

You've implemented the code, but all markers are showing the same image. What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The imageLoader.DisplayImage() method is not working correctly\nB) The for loop in getInfoContents() is overwriting the image for each marker\nC) The marker.getSnippet() is not returning the correct index\nD) The URL for the hotel images is invalid\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe issue is likely caused by the for loop in the getInfoContents() method. This loop iterates through all markers for each info window, ultimately setting the image to the last item in the list. To fix this, you should remove the loop and use the specific index for the clicked marker.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\nA) If the imageLoader.DisplayImage() method wasn't working, no images would appear at all.\nC) While the snippet parsing could be improved, it's not the root cause of showing the same image for all markers.\nD) If the URL was invalid, no images would load, rather than the same image for all markers."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/317087", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/187290/"], "docs_id": 317087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a series of reference codes that my end users create during the course of the day.

Am I better off doing something like this\n\n```\nvar transactionCode = $('input[name=TransactionCode]').val();\nvar referenceCode = $('input[name=ReferenceCode]').val();\n\n// Do this type of test for all 15 types of reference codes until I\n// succeed\nif (transactionCode === 'BB01') {\n    var results = /\\d{8}/.test(referenceCode);\n    // if results is true, blah blah blah\n}\n\n```\n2.

But both moon and earth attract themselves towards them. So why doesn't earth goes round the moon? It is feeling a force too. So it should also accelerate around the moon.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It *does*.** The Earth and Moon both rotate \"around each other\" as modelled here (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter)):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oW3ZR.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oW3ZR.gif)\n\nNote that this is just and example model. The effect on Earth is in reality even smaller than visualized here (and the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular). \n\nHad the two objects had the same masses, then the orbital motions would have been equal:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBEO7.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBEO7.gif) [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zv7vE.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zv7vE.gif)\n\nThe issue is what \"rotating around something\" exactly means. You could say that neither of the objects rotate around each other in any of the cases shown \\- because in fact they rotate around their shared \"mid\\-point\", so to say. This point is called the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter). The barycenter is the point that their gravitational influences \"average down to\", if we were to imagine a stationary non\\-orbiting object that they both rotated around.\n\nA smaller (less massive) object gives a weaker gravitational pull, thus causing a smaller centripetal acceleration of the more massive object, giving it a smaller orbit and smaller orbital speed. This is the case for the Earth\\-Moon system.\n\nAlthough the mechanism is the same, and they both still rotate around the barycenter, the more massive Earth is rather \"wobbling\" than rotating/orbiting. It **is** still orbiting about the barycenter, but that barycenter is located **inside it** not far from it's own centre.\n\nSome good illustrations of the real barycenter location in the Earth\\-Moon system are found in [this answer](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/14370) on the Astronomy SE site, visualizing how close that barycentre is to Earth's own centre and therefore how little an effect the Moon has on Earth."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the orbital relationship between the Earth and the Moon?\n\nA) The Moon orbits around the Earth, while the Earth remains stationary.\n\nB) The Earth and Moon both orbit around their common barycenter, with the Moon's motion being more pronounced due to its smaller mass.\n\nC) The Earth and Moon orbit each other with equal orbital motions, regardless of their mass difference.\n\nD) The Moon orbits the Earth, while the Earth orbits the Sun independently of the Moon's influence.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Earth and Moon both orbit around their common barycenter, which is the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system. Due to the significant mass difference between the two bodies (Earth being much more massive), the barycenter is located inside the Earth, close to its center. This results in the Moon's orbital motion being much more noticeable, while the Earth appears to \"wobble\" slightly. The motion is not equal (ruling out option C), the Earth is not stationary (ruling out option A), and the Earth's orbit around the Sun is indeed influenced by the Moon, albeit slightly (ruling out option D). Option B correctly captures the essence of their orbital relationship, acknowledging both bodies' motion around the barycenter and the difference in their apparent motions due to their mass disparity."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/25", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/191452", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/12138/"], "docs_id": 191452, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How many elements of $\\\\mathrm{SL}\\_n(\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p)$ have all nonzero entries?
