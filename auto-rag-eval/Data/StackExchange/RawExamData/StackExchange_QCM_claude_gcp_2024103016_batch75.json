And the destination has \\~500GB of space free!\n\nIs there some way to get to the cause of this strange error?

The documentation shows that restarting the udev service with \"sudo service udev restart\" is sufficient to apply the changes.\n\nThe correct answer is D because while the other steps are necessary, rebooting the entire system is not required according to the provided instructions. Restarting the udev service is enough to apply the changes without a full system reboot."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/08", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/85733", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/31923/"], "docs_id": 85733, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My items are not showing an out of stock message/label on the catogroy pages, if you click a sold out item it does state as out of stock on the product page..\n\nI installed an app to move all of the out of stock items last.\nI also edited my theme a little and I am wondering if I have excellently clicked the wrong settings or removed some code. I can't find any information about this online, as I am sure its not something that normally goes wrong, or I am just being stupid.\n\nThis is very annoying because people do not know what is out of stock until they click items and then they may just think everything is out of stock and give up looking.\n\n---\n\n\\=\\=\\=\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Magento\n *\n * @category    design\n * @package     meigeetheme_default\n * @copyright   Copyright (c) 2012 MeigeeTeam.

To prove this (using forcing) one seems to need a countable transitive model of ZFC. The texts I am reading avoid this by proving Con(T \\+ CH) for all (suitable) finite fragments T of ZFC using the Reflection principle to prove the existence of a countable transitive model of T. But doesn't the Reflection principle operate outside of ZFC? From what I understand it just shows how, given a list of axioms of ZFC, one can write down a proof that constructs a model of these axioms.\nAm I confused here or is there an other way to achieve this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reflection principle is a theorem scheme; each of its instances is provable in ZFC. \n\nThe following proof works entirely in ZFC:\n\n1. Assume Con(ZFC) together with not\\-Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) and aim for a contradiction.\n2. By assumption plus completeness theorem, there is a model (M,E) of ZFC. M may be nonstandard in the sense that its ordinals (even its natural numbers) are not well\\-founded.\n3. By compactness, there is some finite sub theory ZFC\\* of ZFC such that ZFC\\*\\+non\\-CH is inconsistent.\n4. Find a (slightly larger) finite sub theory ZFC\\*\\* of ZFC such that ZFC\\*\\* proves all theorems you need about forcing, including that ZFC\\* plus non\\-CH holds in the extension.\n5. (M,E) satisfies reflection for ZFC\\*\\* , so there is some x in M which M thinks is a ctm (countable transitive model) of ZFC\\*\\* . So M can find a Cohen extension y of x which satisfies ZFC\\* plus non\\-CH.\n6. By the easy direction of the completeness theorem, M therefore thinks that ZFC\\*\\+non\\-CH is consistent.\n7. But then this theory is really consistent. (Because any proof of an inconsistency would be coded by a natural number, which is represented in M.)\n\nBtw, I think the sketch I just gave is not ideal since it seems to rely on the existence of infinite sets. The implication from Con(ZFC) to Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) can really be shown in ZF minus infinity, or even in a weak version of Peano arithmetic."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the process of proving Con(ZFC) \u2192 Con(ZFC + \u00acCH) within ZFC?\n\nA) It requires the use of a large cardinal axiom that cannot be proven in ZFC.\n\nB) It can be done using the reflection principle, which is a theorem scheme provable in ZFC, along with forcing and the completeness theorem.\n\nC) It is impossible to prove within ZFC and requires a stronger system.\n\nD) It can only be proven by constructing an actual model of ZFC + \u00acCH.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The proof can be done entirely within ZFC using the reflection principle (which is a theorem scheme in ZFC), forcing techniques, and the completeness theorem. The process involves assuming Con(ZFC) and not-Con(ZFC+non-CH), then using a model of ZFC, applying compactness and reflection to find a countable transitive model within the model, performing forcing within this model, and finally using the completeness theorem to show consistency. This method avoids the need for large cardinal axioms or stronger systems, and doesn't require constructing an actual model of ZFC + \u00acCH in the real world.

You have a frame 80 and frame 90 motor there, so they will be slightly different.\n\n> How is it they have the same max RPM?\n\nTheir max rpm, under no load, will approach 1500 rpm, this is the synchronous speed with a 50 Hz mains frequency.\n\n> Shouldn't more power mean higher speed in the absence of other variables (e.g. weight)? What is the extra current spent on if not speed? Torque? Or is the extra current only drawn under load; in response to a physical resistance (i.e. drag) on the driveshaft?\n\nSpeed is nominally constant, due to the AC frequency being constant, so the other variable, torque, changes. 'Slip' is defined as the % reduction in speed below synchronous. The current drawn by the motor is more or less proportional to the slip. As the motor load increases, the speed will drop, the slip increases, the current and so torque increases, until it reaches the rated speed of 1440 rpm at the rated power, either 1 or 2 hp depending on the motor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is comparing two induction motors with different power ratings but the same nominal speed of 1440 rpm at 50 Hz.

The higher power motor will likely have a different number of turns on the stator windings to achieve its higher power rating while maintaining the same nominal speed. \n\nOption A is incorrect because current draw is proportional to slip and load, not just power rating. \nOption B is incorrect because within the same frame size, rotor diameter typically remains constant. \nOption C is incorrect because both motors will approach the same synchronous speed (close to 1500 rpm) under no load, determined by the mains frequency. \nOption D is correct because changing the number of stator windings is a common way to alter a motor's power characteristics without changing its synchronous speed."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/18", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151308", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/92169/"], "docs_id": 151308, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently upgraded to OS X Yosemite.

I do this because I switch between a couple different devices with these speakers. At one point I plugged them into the speaker port and noticed a very slight difference in the volume. Now both volumes in the properties are at the same level, but the noise coming out was slightly different. \n\nSo do the 2 ports have different \"levels\" of output? Volume, bass, treble...?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on what hardware you have in the computer, but **there usually is a difference between speaker and headphone ports** \\- specifically, relating to the max/min speaker/headphone impedance values you can use with either port.\n\nCertain sound cards, for example the [Auzentech X\\-Fi\\-Forte](http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-fi_forte.php), include a built\\-in headphone amplifier on the headphone port. Taking a look at the actual output port specifications, we can also see different loading levels for the headphone and other line\\-out ports:\n\n```\nHeadphone Load Impedance: 16 - 600 \u03a9\nLine Output    Impedance: 330 \u03a9\nLine/Aux Input Impedance: 10 k\u03a9  (10,000 \u03a9)\n\n```\n\nThis is why many sound cards specify to **not** use a passive (i.e. unamplified) speaker with certain ports, as the lower impedance may cause too much current draw, and possibly damage the particular port. \n\n---\n\nThe general thing to note here, though, is **impedance matching your speakers/headphones to the appropriate port**, and in general, your speakers go to the speaker port, and your (unpowered) headphones go to the headphone port, precisely for the reasons outlined above. This also explains why you might notice a slight difference in the volume levels between the two ports."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A sound engineer is troubleshooting a client's computer audio setup. The client reports a slight difference in volume when switching their 2.1 speaker system between the headphone and speaker ports. Which of the following best explains this observation and provides the most appropriate solution?\n\nA) The difference is due to software settings. Adjust the volume levels in the computer's audio properties to match.\n\nB) The speaker and headphone ports have identical output characteristics. The perceived difference is likely psychoacoustic and can be ignored.\n\nC) The ports have different impedance ranges, which affects the output. The speakers should be connected to the speaker port for optimal performance and to avoid potential damage.\n\nD) The headphone port has a built-in amplifier, making it superior for all audio devices. Always use the headphone port for best results.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that there are usually differences between speaker and headphone ports, particularly in terms of impedance ranges. The headphone port often has a wider impedance range (e.g., 16 - 600 \u03a9) and may include a built-in amplifier, while the speaker port has a different impedance (e.g., 330 \u03a9). This difference in impedance can cause slight variations in volume and overall sound quality.\n\nConnecting speakers to the appropriate port (the speaker port) ensures proper impedance matching, which optimizes performance and reduces the risk of damaging the audio hardware. This approach also explains the slight volume difference the client observed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while software settings can affect volume, they don't address the underlying hardware differences. Option B is wrong as it ignores the real physical differences between the ports. Option D is incorrect because while the headphone port may have an amplifier, it's not necessarily superior for all devices, especially powered speakers."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/30", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/26649361", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 26649361, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have created a web api 2 and I'm trying to do a cross domain request to it but I'm getting the following error:\n\n> *OPTIONS <http://www.example.com/api/save> 405 (Method Not Allowed)*\n\nI have had a look around and most resolutions for this problem are saying that I need to install CORs from NuGet and enable it so I have installed the package and marked my controller with\n\n```\n[EnableCors(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\")]\n\n```\n\nBut this still hasn't resolved the problem.\n\nMy `ApiController` only has the following `Save` method in:\n\n```\n[ResponseType(typeof(int))]\npublic IHttpActionResult Save(Student student)\n{\n    if (ModelState.IsValid)\n    {\n        using (StudentHelper helper = new StudentHelper())\n        {\n            return Ok(helper.SaveStudent(student));\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return BadRequest(ModelState);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is my js from a different domain:\n\n```\n$.ajax({\n    type: \"POST\",\n    crossDomain: true,\n    data: JSON.stringify(student),\n    crossDomain: true,\n    url: 'http://www.example.com/api/save',\n    contentType: \"application/json\",\n    success: function (result) {\n        console.log(result);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\nIs there something else I need to do to enable this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Via nuget make the installation of the CORS web API package for your project:\n\n> **Install\\-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors**\n\nIn WebApiConfig add the following lines:\n\n```\nvar cors = new EnableCorsAttribute (\"*\", \"*\", \"*\");\nconfig.EnableCors (cors);\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is trying to implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in their Web API 2 project to allow cross-domain requests.

"Here's a multi-form question based on the provided TikZ code and diagram:\n\nQuestion: In the control system diagram shown, what is the primary function of the block labeled \"Ki.Kd\" in relation to the overall system performance?\n\nA) It acts as a proportional controller to reduce steady-state error\nB) It introduces derivative action to improve transient response\nC) It provides integral action to eliminate steady-state error\nD) It combines integral and derivative actions to enhance both steady-state accuracy and dynamic response\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The block labeled \"Ki.Kd\" in the diagram represents a combination of integral (Ki) and derivative (Kd) control actions. This type of controller, often referred to as a PID controller when combined with proportional action, serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. The integral (Ki) component helps eliminate steady-state error by accumulating the error over time and applying a correction based on the historical error.\n\n2. The derivative (Kd) component improves the system's dynamic response by anticipating future error based on the rate of change of the error.\n\nBy combining these two actions, the \"Ki.Kd\" block enhances both the steady-state accuracy (through integral action) and the dynamic response (through derivative action) of the control system. This makes option D the correct answer, as it accurately describes the dual function of this block in improving overall system performance.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they only partially describe the function, focusing on either proportional or integral action alone. Option B is also incorrect because it only mentions the derivative action, neglecting the integral component."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/03", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/36371", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/9750/"], "docs_id": 36371, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I plan to install an under\\-counter hot water dispenser and want to pre\\-filter the water.

Specifically, I'd like a filter that removes chlorine, or at least its smell and taste. Could there be problems with insufficient water pressure or other problems I'm not aware of?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You want to get an activated carbon filter (see [this answer](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/31974/157) for an overview of how it works). \n\nYou'll probably want to look at a standard 10\" filter housing and a matching carbon filter, both of which are readily available online and in retail everywhere, including the big box stores. \n\n![filter housing](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pz53.png)\n\nThis can go under your sink or elsewhere upstream. There are clear models available, though these are really only useful for a sediment filter, and even then monitoring the pressure drop across the filter(s) is a better way. \n\nBe sure to install an upstream shut\\-off nearby (if there's not one already) so you can turn it off to change the filter. And pro\\-tip: if you're installing under the sink or other confined location, dry fit it and ensure you'll have enough room to replace the cartridge.\n\n![activated carbon filter block](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yk2qI.png)\n\nFor activated carbon, all you can really do is monitor for taste, and/or change it on a schedule (off the top of my head, at least every 6 months seems reasonable, but check what the manufacturer recommends). The filters are actually rated based on flow rate and the total volume they can handle. \n\nYou can also put the filter upstream of more than just the hot water dispenser (eg, include your kitchen sink cold water as well), and depending on your plumbing and space this might be easier or make more sense. Just be aware of the flow rate (gpm) rating, and total volume. I'd guess for most uses serving the kitchen cold tap only, a 10\" filter would still be fine for this but you do have the option to go to 20\" if you need more volume/flow and have the space."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are installing an under-counter hot water dispenser and want to pre-filter the water to remove chlorine taste and odor.

An activated carbon filter in a standard 10\" housing is recommended for removing chlorine taste and odor from water. It's a widely available and cost-effective solution. The documentation suggests changing the filter at least every 6 months or according to manufacturer recommendations. While there's a mention of being aware of flow rate, there's no indication of significant pressure issues. Sediment filters (A) are not specifically designed for chlorine removal. There's no evidence that only proprietary systems are safe (D), and the question actually seeks alternatives to proprietary options. While pressure should be considered, the text doesn't suggest that an activated carbon filter would cause significant pressure issues (B)."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/30", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/88694", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/33495/"], "docs_id": 88694, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It's may day 2016 and every student can wear graduated cap this weekend in Finland. \n\nI read, that the word \"cap\" is deprecated and the synonym for \"cap\" would be \"headwear\".\n\nI'm going to tell my followers in English that I'm going to have a party with my college graduating cap or \"Going to party wearing my college graduating headwear\".

So I am leaning towards interrupt is not a good idea for radio control.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you've determined that kind of receiver will have a PWM output to control a servo, the Wikipedia [Servo Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control) article has some good information about it. If you wanted to use it anyway the normal neutral position will be 1\\.5mS so you could use something like the following code that uses the [pulseIn](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/pulseIn) function to treat a pulse of 1\\.75mS or longer as being on:\n\n```\n#define MY_PIN 0\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(9600);\n    pinMode(MY_PIN, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n   if (pulseIn(MY_PIN, HIGH) >= 1750)\n      Serial.println(\"TX on\");        \n}\n\n```\n\nNote that the typical period between pulses is 20mS so your code will be stalled in `pulseIn` for around that period. If that's a problem you could go back to using the interrupt and set it for `CHANGE` and keep track of the time between when the line goes high and low again. It would be something like the following untested code:\n\n```\n#define MY_PIN 0 // Make sure this matches the interrupt line\nunsigned long start_micros = 0;\nunsigned long last_duration = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(9600);\n    pinMode(MY_PIN, INPUT);\n    attachInterrupt(0 , PWM_handler, CHANGE);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n   if (last_duration >= 1750)\n      Serial.println(\"TX on\");        \n}\n\nvoid PWM_hander()\n{\n    if (digitalRead(MY_PIN) == HIGH)\n        start_micros = micros();\n    else\n        last_duration = micros() - start_micros;\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using an RC receiver with an Arduino for radio control, which of the following approaches is most appropriate for reading the signal?\n\nA) Using an interrupt triggered on CHANGE to constantly read the signal\nB) Connecting the receiver's output directly to an analog pin and using analogRead()\nC) Using the pulseIn() function to measure the pulse width of the PWM signal\nD) Implementing a software-defined radio protocol using the Arduino's built-in radio module\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) While using an interrupt can be a valid approach, it's not ideal for RC receivers as they continuously output a PWM signal, leading to constant interrupts.\nB) RC receivers typically output a PWM signal, not an analog voltage, so analogRead() would not be appropriate.\nC) This is the correct approach.

A particle in a magnetic field becomes magnetized, and experiences two forces: a *torque* due to the face that its (induced) dipole moment is not aligned with the magnetic field, and a *force* due to the *gradient* of the magnetic field.\n\nNow on a macroscopic level, the gradient is strongest near the poles of the magnet, and you will see a considerable quantity of filings pile up there; but as you get further from the poles, the gradient becomes very weak (roughly as the fourth power of the distance). \n\nThe induced dipole itself is proportional to the strength of the field, and the force is the product of dipole and gradient. This means that the gradient effect becomes **much** weaker with distance: for a bar magnet, field falls roughly with distance cubed (at sufficiently large distance), so gradient falls with fourth power and the attractive force with the **seventh power** of distance. By contrast, the torque that aligns the particles goes as the **sixth power**. That sounds really bad as well, until you realize that a metal filing will act as a local \"field amplifier\": it \"pulls the field lines towards it\", leading to a concentration of field lines at the tip \\- and a strong (but very localized) gradient. This gradient means that nearby filing particles will **strongly** attract each other, and align into the characteristic pattern you are familiar with. But there is no such amplification at a distance \\- so the particles won't move on a large scale, as there are no large scale gradients to push them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student conducts an experiment with iron filings and a bar magnet.

Iron filings in a magnetic field experience two main effects: a torque that aligns them with the field, and a force due to the field gradient that attracts them towards the poles. Near the poles, the gradient is strong, causing filings to pile up. However, the gradient weakens rapidly with distance (approximately as the fourth power of distance for a bar magnet). The attractive force diminishes even more quickly (with the seventh power of distance), while the aligning torque decreases with the sixth power. This rapid decrease in attractive force explains why not all filings move to the poles. Additionally, the filings act as local field amplifiers, creating strong but localized gradients that cause nearby filings to attract and align into the characteristic field line patterns.

Both implement the interface IFly. IFly declares a function `StartFlying()`. Thus both Airplane and Bird have to define the function, and use it as per their requirement. \n\nNow when I make a manual for class reference, what should I write for the function `StartFlying`?\n\n1\\) `StartFlying` is a function of type IFly . \n\n2\\) `StartFlying` is a function of type Airplane \n\n3\\) `StartFlying` is a function of type Bird. \n\nMy opinion is 2 and 3 are more informative. But what i see is that class references use the 1st one. They say what interface the function is declared in. Problem is, I really don't get any usable information from knowing `StartFlying` is IFly type. However, knowing that `StartFlying` is a function inside Airplane and Bird, is more informative, as I can decide which instance (Airplane or Bird ) to use. \n\nAny lights on this: how saying `StartFlying` is a function of type IFly, can help a programmer understanding how to use the function?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think your confusion comes from the fact that you named your interface `IFly`. Any recent programming book recommends to **not** name your interfaces with **I** in front. Give your interface a proper name.\n\nIn your particular example it would be a little bit harder to do this, but let's take this situation:\n\n* Interface is: `FlyingObject`\n* Implementation1: `Airplane implements FlyingObject`\n* Implementation2: `Helicopter implements FlyingObject`\n* Implementation3: `UFO implements FlyingObject`\n\nIf you do this and you try to write a documentation for it, it will be quite clear what `StartFlying on FlyingObject` means.\n\nIn some extreme cases, when it's impossible to find the proper abstraction, you may name your interface with a concrete name like `Foo` and than the implementation `FooImplementation` or `FooImpl`.\n\n**UPDATE:** Of course it always depends on what you are documenting and how. If you document your business logic, you can simply say that any `FlyingObject` has a `startFlying()` method. Your business logic will not create those objects, so you don't care what are they exactly. In fact, this makes things much more clearer once you document that your business logic can use any object that has the `startFlying()` method and you connect that knowledge to the interface. You don't care who creates the `Airplane` or `Helicopter`. All you know and document from the point of view of the business logic is that you can start flying if you have an object capable doing so.\n\nOn the other hand if you document your factories or whatever logic you have that decides what type of flying object to create, there you can document something like 'Airplane, Helicopter, etc. must implement FlyingObject, otherwise they can't take you to Japan'. \n\nI hope this update clarifies all the question you were asking."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented programming, you're designing a system for flying objects. You have an interface called FlyingObject with a method startFlying(), and multiple classes implementing this interface (Airplane, Helicopter, UFO). When documenting the startFlying() method for a module that uses these objects, which approach is most appropriate and why?\n\nA) Document startFlying() separately for each implementing class (Airplane, Helicopter, UFO)\nB) Document startFlying() only in relation to the FlyingObject interface\nC) Document startFlying() in both the interface and each implementing class\nD) Avoid documenting startFlying() altogether, as the method name is self-explanatory\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Documenting startFlying() in relation to the FlyingObject interface is the most appropriate approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Abstraction: It emphasizes the abstract concept of a flying object, rather than tying the documentation to specific implementations.\n\n2. Flexibility: It allows for future additions of new flying object types without needing to update the documentation.\n\n3. Polymorphism: It supports the principle of programming to an interface, not an implementation, which is a key concept in object-oriented design.\n\n4. Clarity: It clearly communicates that any object implementing the FlyingObject interface will have this method, regardless of its specific type.\n\n5. Maintainability: It centralizes the documentation, making it easier to maintain and update.\n\nOption A is less ideal because it would lead to repetitive documentation and doesn't emphasize the shared interface. Option C is redundant and could lead to inconsistencies.

But I am not sure of the idea carrying to the necessity in the decimal system \\-\\- why not start an index from 1?\n\nDoes anyone have historical knowledge of programming languages where the decision to begin indexes at zero may have been explained?\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: The Dijkstra writings are further helpful from a mathematical standpoint, but even has he noted, not all languages are zero\\-indexed. WBT's explanation also makes sense as to why one would start with zero based on memory addresses. (I know some languages handle indexing slightly different based on array manipulation.)\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for the *why* (which I very much appreciate because it helps further an understanding) but more along the lines of *when* did this become the convention and/or whether it can be traced to a specific language.\n\nSo, for instance in K\\&R's C, when discussing array indexes, K or R matter\\-of\\-factly explains, \"Array subscripts always start at zero in C...\" (p. 22\\) Later, in discussing a function to process character arrays, \"... a more useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end\\-of\\-file return because it never is a valid line length.\" (p. 127\\)\n\nBased on K\\&R, I gather a) the convention is adopted from elsewhere, so C is not the inspiration behind zero\\-indexing and b) there are possibly deeper reasons for its use based on the second example. I know K\\&R is so widely regarded for its clear prose, so that's another reason I include it, to give an example of what I had hoped another documented language would do to explain the reason behind zero\\-indexing.\n\nI think both WBT and btilly offer equally good reasons; I wondered if anyone who perhaps knew old (pre\\-C?) languages which documented the design decision. And at the same time I recognize such information may not exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's about offsets. You have an address, which points to the location in memory where the array begins. Then to access any element, you multiply the array index by the size of the element and add it to the starting address, to find the address for that element. \n\nThe first element is at the starting point, so you multiply the size of the element by *zero* to get *zero* which is what you add to the starting address to find the location of the first element.\n\nThe convention spread because programmers started working in very low\\-level languages where memory addresses were directly manipulated and in most cases building up from there, maintaining the same convention at each step so that they wouldn't have to relearn or be prone to mistakes when switching between conventions. It's still important to understand how this addressing works especially when working with lower\\-level languages. I agree this can be a stumbling block for people who are first learning to program in a higher\\-level language. \n\nThe [Wikipedia article on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#Origin) also cites a common machine instruction used when working \"backwards\" and detecting the end of a loop, namely \"decrement and jump if zero.\" \n\nAn exception: MATLAB [and some other languages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1499749/list-of-1-indexed-programming-languages) bucked the trend and went with an index starting at 1, apparently under the impression that it would be a first programming language for a lot of their target users and that for those folks, starting with 1 makes more intuitive sense. This causes some frustrations for the (relatively small subset of?) programmers who frequently switch between programming languages that start counting at different values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the historical reason for zero-based indexing in most programming languages?\n\nA) It was invented by Dijkstra for mathematical elegance\nB) It aligns with how memory addresses and offsets work in computer architecture\nC) It was first introduced in the C programming language by Kernighan and Ritchie\nD) It originates from the binary number system used in computers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) While Dijkstra did write about zero-based indexing, this wasn't the historical origin.\nB) This is correct.

Names are only auxiliary thing, designed to allow easier access for us humble human beings. For the service to be independent, it has to have a dedicated IP/IPv6 address.\n\nOnly HTTP was extended somewhat to give host names extended meaning. Absolutely any other protocol only gives meaning to addresses and ports. Also NAT appeared that allows several hosts to hide behind a single address; previously if you wanted the host to communicate with the Internet you had to assign some globally unique routed (public) address to it.\n\nConsequently, you can't rely on names so much, and you **absolutely** have to use different IP addresses and/or ports to direct traffic to different services. You can't distinguish anything just by names.\n\n---\n\nFor HTTP **only**, it is possible to run name\\-based reverse proxy (any will do: Nginx, Caddy, Haproxy, Apache), so all websites will be available without the need to specify port names. However, for HTTPS, you'll terminate the TLS layer on the reverse proxy, therefore you'll need to have all the globally trusted certificates and their corresponding private keys on the reverse proxy, it's natural to run it on the front end node. (With Haproxy it might be possible to also analyse the ALPN and SNI in the ClientHello and directly pass HTTPS traffic to back end servers based on name, but that's really advanced topic.)\n\nFor all other protocols the best you have is this:\n\n```\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3389 -> 192.168.1.10:3389\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3390 -> 192.168.1.20:3389\nTCP 88.101.10.30:3391 -> 192.168.1.30:3389\n\n```\n\nand so on. Notice different ports are mapped to different servers. Basically there is **no way to go around** this.\n\nWhile each of those servers can run its own VPN service, it might be better to run a single service on the front end system and provide different access (different firewall rules) to different back end servers for different clients, based on client certificate DNs. This way, after connecting to the VPN, each of them will see and use internal server addresses (192\\.168\\.1\\.x) directly without any NAT.\n\nAlso, for the SSH access you may employ SSH Jump Host configuration so it'll *appear* to the users as if they connect to the internal servers directly. For that, you create a limited user on the front end node. Each user generates a SSH key and you install these keys as usual on the back end nodes. Additionally, you install this key to the front end system into that limited user's authorized\\_keys, and further limit it to only permit that connection for TCP port forwarding. The users then configure their SSH clients to automatically use public IP as a jump host when connecting to the back end systemd (using e.g. ProxyJump option).\n\n---\n\nI'd like to also incorporate @davidgo suggestion: change IP addressing away from 192\\.168\\.1\\.x, because it is configured on many SOHO devices by default (also, don't use 192\\.168\\.0\\.x, 192\\.168\\.88\\.x, and so on).

For most protocols, including non-HTTP services, the company needs to use different ports on the public IP address to map to different internal servers. This is because the Internet primarily runs on IP addresses and ports, not hostnames. While HTTP(S) can use name-based virtual hosting with a reverse proxy, other protocols typically require unique IP:port combinations to distinguish between services.

After the second cut the pipe should be 3/4\\-1 inch protruding from the ground. Next make 2 cuts so that the pipe is cut in quarters. With a cold chisel and short handled sledge pound each of the 4 quartered pipe sections inwards to the pipe.  Hammer each section at a time until they touch the inside of the pipe. When done the pipe will be below ground level and ready to be filled with asphalt.  Alternately, once the pipe has been cut so that it is close to the ground cut the inside wall with a new saw\\-zall metal blade and again at 30 degrees from the first.

The new version lets you create groups of hosts and groups of VMs then create one of four different rules against these. The rules are;\n\n* VM members in a named VM group *must* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *should* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *mustn't* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *shouldn't* run on hosts members in a named host group\n\nNow this is far from the ideal I was looking for which was to have the ability to store the enclosure and/or rack number with the host meta data then define VM groups and apply a rule saying 'spread these VMs as evenly as possible amongst these hosts' \\- but beggars can't be choosers etc.\n\nSo the way I've done it, and this might sound crude but it works and is easy to maintain, was to create a host group called something like 'evens' and another called 'odds' I can then fill these host groups out with hosts that live in racks that are even or odd numbered. For instance all hosts in rack VV041 go into the 'odd's group, whereas hosts in rack 'FF068' go into the 'even's group.\n\nWhat I then did was do the same for VMs', for instance servers 'web01', 'sql1' \\& 'app75' go into the 'odds' VM group and 02's, 24's, 98's etc. go into the 'even's group.\n\nAfter that all you need to do is create two rules, one that says 'odd numbered VMs should live on odd numbered hosts' and vice versa. Expect a vMotion storm if you manually run DRS :)\n\nSo that works ok for me, I have a roughly even balance of VMs across hosts and importantly no two\\-member clusters could ever live in the same enclosure/rack as I'd always name them sequentially (i.e. 01 and 02\\). Does the job and is easy to manage.\n\nHope this helps the 0\\.000002% of IT geeks this addresses :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In vCenter 4.1's updated DRS rule system, which of the following accurately describes the new capabilities for creating rules between host groups and VM groups?\n\nA) You can create rules that force VMs to run on specific hosts, but cannot create rules to prevent VMs from running on certain hosts.\nB) You can create four types of rules: must run on, should run on, must not run on, and should not run on.\nC) You can create rules to spread VMs evenly across all hosts in a cluster automatically.\nD) You can assign rack numbers to hosts and use these to create rules for VM placement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, vCenter 4.1's updated DRS rule system allows users to create four different types of rules between VM groups and host groups:\n1.

Who **has** already read three English novels?\n> 2. Who **have** already read three English novels?\n\nOr could both be correct?\n\nPlease also provide the grammatical reasons for your answers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The OP's question involves the topic of interrogative pronouns (e.g. **\"who\"** and **\"what\"**) and the question of whether they could be considered to be singular or plural.\n\n***In general***, the interrogative pronoun **\"who\"** takes the **default value of singular**; and when it does take the value of singular, its question can allow both singular and plural answers. And so, that's why we often see questions using the default singular (that is, singular subject\\-verb agreement).\n\nBut when the speaker is expecting only a plural answer, then the speaker could use a **plural override** when forming their question \\-\\- but usually that is not obligatory, and usually the speaker can still use the default singular in their question. But, sometimes there are exceptions, when the plural override is **obligatory**, and that obligatory plural override often occurs when the grammar of the question requires or strongly prefers a plural verb (e.g. a predicative complement realized by a plural noun phrase).\n\nSo, with that as a grammatical background, let's look at the OP's context for those candidate questions. The OP's context is described as:\n\n> The situation is that: We've already read three English novels.\n\nwhere I'm assuming that two or more of the addressees have read at least 3 novels. It is possible that the \"we\" includes only the speaker and one other person, but I'd think it more feasible that there are three or more people involved here (e.g. a classroom with more than one teacher and two students). The rest of my post will work with that assumption: there is a speaker and at least two addressees.\n\nIf the speaker doesn't really know whether the answer will be singular or plural, or is willing to expect either a singular or plural answer, then the speaker will (in general) use the **default singular** for their question:\n\n> 1\\) Who **has** already read three English novels?\n\nbecause that allows both a singular and a plural answer.\n\nBut if the speaker expects that more than two (students) will respond in the affirmative, then, often the speaker might choose to use the **optional plural override:**\n\n> 2\\) Who **have** already read three English novels?\n\nbecause the speaker is expecting to get two or more affirmative answers. But, this is optional to the speaker; the speaker can still use the default singular version, because this is not one of the exceptions that I had mentioned earlier.\n\n**ANSWER:** So, to answer the OP's questions:\n\n> Which is the correct question for that situation? Or could both be correct?\n\nfor the specific candidate questions, it seems that both versions could be considered to be grammatical for that given context. It would be up to the speaker as to which one they would want to use.\n\n\\= \\= \\= \\= \\= SOME VETTED GRAMMATICAL INFO \\= \\= \\= \\= \\=\n\nOP asked:\n\n> Please also provide the grammatical reasons for your answers.\n\nFor more information on this topic, there is the 2002 reference grammar by Huddleston and Pullum et al., *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* (CGEL), pages 505\\-6\\.\n\nRelated excerpt from *CGEL* pages 505\\-6:\n\n> **(d) Interrogatives**\n> \n> \n> In general, the interrogative pronouns *who* and *what* take the default value of singular.

In \\[ii], with determinative *which* as fused determiner\\-head, we have a singular or plural verb according to whether the answer is presupposed to be singular or plural.\n> \n> \n> The default singular values for *who* and *what* can, however, be overridden when there is a presupposition that the answer is plural:\n> \n> \n> \\[20]\n> \n> \n> * i. *What are going to be the deciding factors?*\n> * ii. *Who haven't yet handed in their assignments?*\n> * iii. *Who have excelled themselves in this year's coxed pairs?*\n> * iv. *What have pointed ears and long tails?*\n> \n> \n> In \\[i] the override is obligatory: this case is similar to those discussed for fused relatives such as \\[18\\.i], with the plural PC *the deciding factors* forcing a plural construal of *what*.\n> \n> \n> A likely context for \\[20\\.ii] is one where I'm addressing a group of students and assuming that a plurality of them haven't handed in their assignments; singular *hasn't* would be possible (but without indicating any expectation of a plural answer and favouring singular *assignment* if there is only one each).\n> \n> \n> In \\[20\\.iii], coxed pairs involve three people (two rowers and the cox), so the presupposition is again that the answer is plural. The reflexive has to be plural, and this favours a plural verb.\n> \n> \n> Finally, \\[iv] presupposes a generic bare plural as answer, e.g. *foxes*, but the motivation for a plural override is relatively small since the answer could be given in the form of a generic singular, e.g. *a fox*.\n\n---\n\nThere's also some related information in the older 1985 reference grammar by Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, Svartvik, *A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language* (1985 Quirk et al.). On page 371, footnote \\[a]:\n\n> **\\[a]** *Who* has both singular and plural reference, but when neither is explicit in the linguistic context, singular concord is the unmarked term. Thus, even though several voices are heard outside, the natural question will be *Who's there?* rather than ?\\* *Who're there?*\n\nNote that the *?\\** symbol means: *tending to unacceptability, but not fully unacceptable.* Also, on page 756, footnote \\[a]:\n\n> **\\[a]** . . . Similarly, interrogative *who* and *what* as subjects normally take a singular verb even when the speaker has reason to believe that more than one person or entity is involved: *Who is making all that noise?* However, a plural verb may be used if other words in the sentence indicate that a plural subject is expected in the answer (*Who have not received their passes?*). . . .\n\n---\n\nEDITED: As a commenter has [mentioned](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/30443/which-is-the-correct-question-who-has-vs-who-have/31139#comment57766_31139), there are also echo questions, where the \"who\" question can easily use a plural verb.

While \"who\" often takes a singular verb by default, it can also take a plural verb in certain contexts:\n\n1. When the speaker expects a plural answer: \"Who have already read three English novels?\"\n2. When other words in the sentence indicate a plural subject: \"Who haven't yet handed in their assignments?\"\n3. In echo questions: \"Who are coming to my party?\"\n4. When a plural verb is grammatically required: \"Who haven't faced each other in the competition yet?\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"who\" doesn't always take a singular verb. Option B is too restrictive, as \"who\" can take a singular verb even when referring to multiple people. Option D is partially true but overly limited, as plural verbs with \"who\" are not restricted to echo questions.\n\nOption C correctly captures the flexibility of \"who\" in taking either singular or plural verbs, depending on the context and the speaker's intention."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/18", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/327376", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/114102/"], "docs_id": 327376, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is super frustrating. I literally cannot grasp the concept of what proper time is and I have no idea why.

I get that.\n\nBut who measures proper time? I don't get it at all. The definition given everywhere makes no sense to me. My book says that the proper time interval is \"the time interval between two events measured by an observer who sees the events occur at the same point in space.\" At **what** same point in space? For whom? What does this even mean at all? Can both the observer on earth and the observer in the space ship **both** have a proper time? By the time dilation formula it's obvious that it refers to the *minimum* time that's possible I guess. Would one the proper time in the ship be the improper time on earth?

In special relativity, proper time is the time measured by an observer in their own reference frame. Each observer (Earth-based and spaceship) measures the proper time of their own clock directly. However, due to time dilation, they can only calculate the proper time elapsed on the other observer's clock using relativistic formulas. This highlights the principle that proper time is specific to each observer's own frame of reference, and that time dilation affects how each observer perceives the passage of time in other reference frames."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/08", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/90954", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4881/"], "docs_id": 90954, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes I spend ridiculous amounts of time (hours) agonizing over making code \"look pretty\".

I was wondering if I am going downhill on my mountain bike without any peddling, will I travel faster or slower because I am fat?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Heavier objects do not fall faster per se. But for heavy objects the influence of the air resistance will be smaller, if they have a similar surface area compared to the light objects.\n\nThe answer depends on the properties of your tyres and the road. But on an even road the air resistance will typically dominate once you reach a certain speed (the friction of the wheels $F\\_W$ will be more or less independent of speed, but not of weight as a heavier person deforms the tyres more, generation more friction, but as it is not the dominant part we will ignore it for now).\n\nThe air resistance of a person will vary approximately like $m^{2/3}$ or $m^{1/3}$ in dependence of the mass. The air resistance in turbulent flow is given by $F\\_R \\= \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\rho c\\_D A v^2$, where $\\\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $c\\_D$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient depending on the form, $A$ is the area of the object perpendicular to the flow and $v$ the velocity relative to the fluid. Your mass scales like $L^3$, so your area scales like $L^2 \\= m^{2/3}$ assuming isotropic growth, the drag coefficent $c\\_D$ will be roughly independent of your weight but highly dependent on your position and clothing, which also influence your surface area).\n\nYour acceleration will be given by:\n$$ a \\= g \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\+ F\\_\\\\text{W} \\- \\\\frac 1 2 c\\_D \\\\rho v^2 \\\\frac{A}{m} \\= \\\\text{const} \\- O(m^{\\-1/3}). $$\n\nThis means you are at an advantage if you are heavier (or rather: larger and therefore heavier), as the influence of the drag scales like $m^{\\-1/3}$.\n\nIf we assume that your weight is not distributed equally in all directions you gain even more. But still, as the range of typical human weights which a bike can support is from about $50\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg} \\\\ldots 150\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$ a light person in a aerodynamic position with tight clothes will probably still be faster than a heavy person sitting upright (as they will reduce their area to a fraction and lower their $C\\_D$)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A mountain biker is coasting downhill without pedaling.

While heavier objects don't fall faster in a vacuum, they do tend to overcome air resistance more easily when falling or moving through air. In this case, Rider B (100 kg) has an advantage over Rider A (60 kg) because the influence of air resistance scales approximately with m^(-1/3), where m is mass. This means the heavier rider experiences proportionally less air resistance.\n\nHowever, the difference in speed may not be dramatic, and other factors play important roles:\n\n1. The rider's position (upright vs. aerodynamic) significantly affects the drag coefficient and frontal area.\n2. Clothing choices can alter aerodynamics.\n3. Tire deformation and resulting friction increase with weight, partially offsetting the air resistance advantage.\n\nThus, while the heavier rider (B) is likely to have a slight speed advantage due to better overcoming air resistance, the difference could be minimal or even negated if the lighter rider (A) adopts a more aerodynamic position or wears more aerodynamic clothing.

Here, combining a convenient architecture with static analysis and some testing may be optimal:\n\n* abstract over the IO registers so that they are only manipulated through macros, functions, or variables with a few easily distinguishable names.\n* find all places that use the airbag\\-related registers. If possible, move them into a single source file.\n* Implement a kind of static analysis to ensure that:\n\n(1\\) no code accesses the registers without going through the abstraction layer\n\n(2\\) no code except for specific files uses the airbag\\-related registers\n\nThis might be as simple as a shell script that greps all source files for specific pattern, and compares the matching file list:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file in `find src/ include/ \\\n    -type f \\( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' \\) \\\n    -exec grep -l 'REG_TRIGGER_AIRBAG' {} +`\ndo\n  case \"$file\" in\n    include/registers.h) ;;  # ok\n    src/airbags.c) ;;  # ok\n    *)\n      echo \"unexpected file is accessing airbag registers: $file\"\n      exit 1\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\n```\n* Those source files that do use the airbag\\-related registers, test thoroughly. Consider using white\\-box techniques to construct a test suite with high coverage. This can be simplified by organizing the code linearly, and expressing the preconditions through guard clauses:\n\n```c\n/* called every 5ms */\nvoid trigger_airbag_if_necessary(bool A, bool B, bool C) {\n  if (!A) return;\n  if (!B) return;\n  if (C) return;\n  SET_REGISTER(REG_TRIGGER_AIRBAG, 1);\n}\n\n```\n\nIf the conditions are linear, it is easier to build a mental model of the conditions leading up to the event being triggered. Also, we only need 4 test cases for complete coverage of that function. More complex conditions do not fit into this schema, and the tests could be based on a flowchart or a truth table.\n\nThis strategy of isolating the relevant code is not perfect. It is possible to subvert these checks. But this should protect against *accidental* mistakes. E.g. if I set the airbag\\-related registers in a different part of the code, the static analysis will alert you quickly to the problem.\n\nYour first hunch that we would have to verify the complete program state is not entirely wrong. But fortunately, we can shape that state space so that airbag\\-triggering events must go through a specific area, and we can pay extra attention to that area."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A critical safety system in an automobile requires the following condition to be met:\n\"If and only if A and B and not C, then D must happen within 10ms\"\n\nWhich of the following approaches would be most effective in ensuring this requirement is met while managing the complexity of testing?\n\nA) Implement exhaustive testing of all possible program states to verify the condition is always met.\n\nB) Use formal verification methods to mathematically prove the correctness of the entire system.\n\nC) Isolate the critical code, use static analysis to restrict access, and focus thorough testing on the isolated components.\n\nD) Rely solely on simulation-based testing to approximate real-world conditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most practical and effective approach.

At very large scales, it distances along the surface are more curved and therefore the difference between the incorrect Pythagorean Theorem and the correct Haversine Formula is greater.\n\nDoes anyone know a formula or rule of thumb that tells you the difference between the two distance measures based on the scale of the distance you are trying to measure? \n\nI think having this explicitly would help in:\n\n1. explaining why the Pythagorean Theorem isn't perfect; and\n2. in letting people who are looking for more \"rough\" distances know when Pythagoras actually will serve their purposes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using the Pythagorean formula on positions given in latitude and longitude makes as little sense as, say, computing the area of a circle using the formula for a square: although it produces a number, there is no reason to suppose it ought to work.\n\nAlthough at small scales *any* smooth surface looks like a plane, the accuracy of the Pythagorean formula depends on the *coordinates* used. When those coordinates are latitude and longitude on a sphere (or ellipsoid), we can expect that\n\n1. Distances along lines of longitude will be reasonably accurate.\n2. Distances along the Equator will be reasonably accurate.\n3. All other distances will be erroneous, in rough proportion to the differences in latitude and longitude.\n\nThe error depends on the start and end point of the distance calculations. However, because both the sphere and ellipsoid have a circular symmetry around the axis, the error depends only on the *difference* of the longitudes, so to study this error we might as well take the point of origin to be at the Prime Meridian. Because both the sphere and ellipsoid are symmetric under a north\\-south reflection, we only need to study points of origin in the southern hemisphere. For any such point we may draw a contour map of the relative error, equal to \\[Pythagorean calculation] / \\[True distance].\n\nThe Pythagorean formula, using the mean radius of the earth, is\n\n```\nPythagorean distance =  6371000. * Sqrt[dx^2 + dy^2]] * pi / 180 meters\n\n```\n\nwhere *dx* is the difference in longitudes and *dy* is the difference in latitudes, both in degrees. (The difference in longitude values is reduced modulo 360 to give the correct value of *dx* when crossing the antimeridian; not doing so would introduce artificially large errors that tell us nothing about the Pythagorean formula itself.)\n\nThe following plots show the relative error compared to the correct distance on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for latitudes from \\-70 to 0 in increments of 10 degrees. The horizontal coordinate is the difference in longitudes and the vertical coordinate is the latitude of the destination. Light regions have relatively small error: the contour lines are at 1, 1\\.01, 1\\.02, 1\\.05, 1\\.1, 1\\.2, 1\\.5, 2, etc. (The pure white areas in the corners are places where the error goes beyond the range of these contours.) The red dots show the point of origin.\n\n![Plots](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UX2wR.png)\n\nThe vertical white bands testify to the correctness of expectation (1\\): Pythagorean distances are accurate when there is a small difference in longitudes. The horizontal white bands at low latitudes confirm expectation (2\\): near the Equator, horizontal distances are reasonably accurate. Otherwise, as witnessed by the extensive darker regions, at *all* other distances the Pythagorean formula is bad.\n\n---\n\nWe can make quantitative estimates of the *maximum* error attained for pairs of nearby points (within, say, a few hundred kilometers of each other). Scale\\-\\-using an appropriate value for the radius\\-\\-is true along the meridian but along a circle of latitude it errs approximately by the secant of the latitude. For example, at a latitude of 40 degrees the secant is 1\\.31, implying the Pythagorean formula will give distances about 31% too large in the east\\-west direction. (This is evident in the upper right contour plot, for a point of origin at \\-40 degrees latitude, where the region immediately east\\-west of the red dot lies between the 1\\.2 and 1\\.5 contours.) Short distances in all other directions will be too large by some amount between 0% and 31%; longer distances may err by even more (as the contour plots show)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A geographer is calculating distances between two points on Earth using latitude and longitude coordinates.

This is because:\n\n1. At very small scales, Earth's surface approximates a plane, making the Pythagorean theorem more accurate for short distances.\n2. Along the equator and lines of longitude, the Pythagorean theorem provides reasonably accurate results.\n3. The error increases with latitude due to the curvature of the Earth. At higher latitudes, the error in east-west distances can be significant (e.g., about 31% too large at 40 degrees latitude).\n4.

All you need is the [`tr` utility](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tr.1.html), plus a loop and redirections to act on the files that are passed as arguments to the script.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file do\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$file.safe\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nWith the option `-d`, `tr` removes the specified characters. The characters to remove are passed together as the first non\\-option argument. You can use backslash escapes to represent special characters: `\\n` for a newline (^J), `\\r` for a carriage return (^M), `\\t` for a tab (^I), etc.\n\nI haven't reproduced the code for asking the user because it's pointless. Directories will cause an error with redirection anyway, and it's really the job of the caller not to request a nonsensical action such as treating a directory as a regular file, so I also skipped that part.\n\nIf you want to replace the original file, write to a temporary file then move the result in place.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file do\n  tmp=\"$(TMPDIR=$(dirname -- \"$file\") mktemp)\"\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nThe temporary file name is constructed using `mktemp` so that the script is robust. It will work as long as you have write permission to the directory containing the file, without risking overwriting an existing file. It's secure even if that directory is writable by other users who might try to inject other data (a potential problem in `/tmp`).\n\nThe `mv` command is only invoked if the call to `tr` succeeded, so there's no risk of losing data if `tr` fails, e.g. because the disk becomes full midway through.\n\nIf you want to avoid replacing the file by a new, identical file if it doesn't contain any special characters, there are two ways:\n\n* You can check for the special characters first. There are several ways to do it. One way is to remove everything except those special characters and count the number of resulting characters. As an optimization, pipe through `head -c 1` so that you don't need to go through the whole file if a special character is found close to the top: that way the count is 0 if there's nothing to do and 1 otherwise.\n\n```\nif [ \"$(tr -dc '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" | head -c 1 | wc -c)\" -ne 0 ]; then\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\nfi\n\n```\n* You can do the transformation, then check if it's identical to the original. This can be slower if the files are often already in the desired state. On the other hand, this technique generalizes to cases where it isn't easy to determine whether the file is in the desired state.\n\n```\ntr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" &&\nif cmp -s \"$tmp\" \"$file\"; then\n  rm -- \"$tmp\"\nelse\n  mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\nfi\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following code snippets most efficiently removes carriage return (^M) and tab (^I) characters from a file while ensuring data integrity and handling potential errors?\n\nA) \n```bash\nfor file in *; do\n    sed 's/\\r//g;s/\\t//g' \"$file\" > \"$file.tmp\"\n    mv \"$file.tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nB) \n```bash\nfor file do\n  tmp=\"$(TMPDIR=$(dirname -- \"$file\") mktemp)\"\n  tr -d '\\r\\t' <\"$file\" >\"$tmp\" && mv -f -- \"$tmp\" \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nC)\n```bash\nfor file in *; do\n    if grep -q $'\\r\\t' \"$file\"; then\n        tr -d '\\r\\t' < \"$file\" > \"$file.safe\"\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\nD)\n```bash\nfor file do\n    sed -i 's/\\r//g;s/\\t//g' \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and safest approach.
