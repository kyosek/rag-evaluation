This results in information set in one that the other doesn't know about. Years ago when I still used `aptitude`, I found myself doing update checks in both because I was getting confusing results. Using `aptitude` exclusively would hide this problem, but as soon as you something else, it becomes apparatnt.\n\nSolution: either use *only* `aptitude` or *never* use `aptitude`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has recently upgraded their Debian system from Lenny to Squeeze using apt-get. They typically use aptitude for package management due to its automatic handling of unused packages. After the upgrade, they notice discrepancies in package handling between apt-get and aptitude. What is the best course of action to maintain consistency in package management?\n\nA) Continue using both apt-get and aptitude interchangeably, as they should synchronize automatically over time.\nB) Use aptitude exclusively for all future package management tasks.\nC) Use apt-get exclusively for all future package management tasks.\nD) Manually mark all packages as \"Auto\" in aptitude to match apt-get's handling.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that aptitude keeps additional state information beyond what apt-get uses, leading to inconsistencies when both tools are used. To avoid confusion and maintain consistent package management, it's recommended to either use aptitude exclusively or never use it at all. Since the administrator prefers aptitude's automatic handling of unused packages, the best course of action is to use aptitude exclusively for all future package management tasks.

For example:\n\n> Kate **has** a relationship with the guy.\n> \n> \n> Kate **is having** a ralationship with the guy.\n\nI thought that the use of *have* in the present continuous in this context is totally incorrect, but the teacher in this [video](https://youtu.be/YJZBcL-9gsA) uses it in the progressive. It is at 4 minutes and 3 seconds. Is that some kind of new American grammar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whoever told you that *have* isn't used in the present continuous was wrong \\- or more likely, what you were told was incomplete.\n\nWhen we use *have* to mean *possess*, we don't use it in the present continuous. But in other uses, the present continuous is possible and even common:\n\nI am having (eating) lunch  \n\nI am having a good time  \n\nI am not having any luck with this  \n\nI am having second thoughts about this  \n\nI am having a baby  \n\nI am having people over for dinner  \n\n...\n\nWhen we say *I am having a relationship*, the word *have* does not mean *possess*; rather, the phrase means *I am in a relationship*.\n\nThis particular phrase is more complicated than some of the examples listed above, because you *can* possess a relationship \\- or something close. If I say, \"I have a relationship with my father,\" this is (more or less) the *possession* meaning of *have*. So I cannot say, \"I am having a relationship with my father.\" Or rather, I can, but it would sound strange, because it would imply that I am in a romantic relationship with my father.\n\nThis is just another of those annoying things about English. *Relationship* has multiple meanings \\- one being romantic, one being platonic or familial. Typically, we use a different verb for those two meanings: *be* in a relationship is romantic; *have* a relationship is not. \n\nAnd, if that weren't already confusing enough, *having* a relationship means *being in a romantic relationship*.\n\nSorry!"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"have\" in relation to relationships is most accurate?\n\nA) \"Have\" can never be used in the present continuous when talking about relationships.\n\nB) \"I am having a relationship\" always implies a romantic involvement, while \"I have a relationship\" always indicates a platonic or familial connection.\n\nC) The phrase \"Kate is having a relationship with the guy\" is grammatically incorrect in all contexts.\n\nD) The use of \"have\" in the present continuous for relationships depends on the intended meaning and can be correct in certain contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the use of \"have\" in the present continuous when talking about relationships is nuanced and context-dependent. While it's true that \"have\" isn't typically used in the present continuous for possession, it can be used this way for other meanings, including relationships.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"have\" can be used in the present continuous for relationships in certain contexts, especially to imply an ongoing romantic involvement.\n\nOption B oversimplifies the issue. While \"I am having a relationship\" often implies a romantic involvement, and \"I have a relationship\" is more commonly used for platonic or familial connections, these aren't absolute rules. Context plays a crucial role in determining the meaning.\n\nOption C is too absolute. While \"Kate is having a relationship with the guy\" might sound unusual in some contexts, it's not grammatically incorrect. It can be used to emphasize the current, ongoing nature of a romantic relationship.\n\nThe correct answer, D, acknowledges the complexity of the issue.

I understand that there are three ways of handling objects:\n\n* By value (objects are copied or moved when passed into and out of functions)\n* By reference\n* By shared or unique pointer (raw pointers are frowned upon unless you really need them)\n\nIn general I see it as good practice to avoid using shared pointers but as I'm developing a lot of code recently I'm finding that I initial define something as a value type and then end up having to make it a shared pointer. This situation occurs so frequently that almost every object in my system is in a shared pointer! This seems wrong.\n\nMost of my classes look somewhat like this:\n\n```\nclass Container\n{\npublic:\n    // ...other functions\n\n    std::shared_ptr<Thing> GetThing() const;\n    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Thing>> GetThings() const;\n\nprivate:\n    std::shared_ptr<Thing> thing;\n    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Thing>> things;\n}\n\n```\n\nInitially this class would have contained value objects of type Thing, but then other classes need access to these objects and so to avoid copying them when they get returned from the 'getter' functions I've put them into shared pointers. This means that if any changes occur to these objects their state will be consistent to the container and those objects currently accessing the 'things'.\n\nWhy does this feel wrong, and how can I improve this approach? What is the correct 'C\\+\\+' way of doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not clear what you do with those objects.\n\nIf you want to copy the non\\-copyable class, then using shared\\_ptr is fine as you did.\n\nIf you want to copy objects, then return a value.\n\nIf you just want to provide access to those objects, then use references :\n\n```\nclass Container\n{\npublic:\n    // ...other functions\n\n    const Thing& GetThing() const;\n    const std::vector<Thing>& GetThings() const;\n\nprivate:\n    Thing thing;\n    std::vector<Thing> things;\n};\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In C++, when designing a class that needs to provide access to its member objects, which of the following approaches is generally considered the best practice for getter methods, assuming the objects don't need to be copied or shared ownership is not required?\n\nA) Return shared pointers to the objects\nB) Return raw pointers to the objects\nC) Return const references to the objects\nD) Return copies of the objects\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the best practice in this scenario. Returning const references provides access to the objects without unnecessary copying or ownership transfer. It's efficient and maintains encapsulation.\n\nOption A (shared pointers) is often overused and introduces unnecessary overhead when shared ownership isn't required. \n\nOption B (raw pointers) is generally discouraged in modern C++ due to potential memory management issues.\n\nOption D (returning copies) can be inefficient, especially for large objects, and doesn't allow the caller to see changes made to the original object.\n\nThe correct approach, as shown in the documentation, would be:\n\n```cpp\nclass Container\n{\npublic:\n    const Thing& GetThing() const;\n    const std::vector<Thing>& GetThings() const;\n\nprivate:\n    Thing thing;\n    std::vector<Thing> things;\n};\n```\n\nThis pattern provides efficient access while maintaining proper encapsulation and const-correctness."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/07/27", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1420658", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1618202/"], "docs_id": 1420658, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just installed Ubuntu 22\\.04 and copied all my music files to the Music folder.

I had a large\\-ish training set and so I randomly (stratified random sampling) set aside a test set. I fitted $m$ different methods to the training set samples and using the $m$ resulting models I predicted the response for the test set samples and computed a RMSEP over the samples in the test set. This is a single **run**.\n\nI then repeated this process a large number of times, each time I chose a different training set by randomly sampling a new test set.\n\nHaving done this I want to investigate if any of the $m$ methods has better or worse RMSEP performance. I also would like to do multiple comparisons of the pair\\-wise methods.\n\nMy approach has been to fit a linear mixed effects (LME) model, with a single random effect for **Run**. I used `lmer()` from the **lme4** package to fit my model and functions from the **multcomp** package to perform the multiple comparisons. My model was essentially\n\n```\nlmer(RMSEP ~ method + (1 | Run), data = FOO)\n\n```\n\nwhere `method` is a factor indicating which method was used to generate the model predictions for the test set and `Run` is an indicator for each particular **Run** of my \"experiment\".\n\nMy question is in regard to the residuals of the LME. Given the single random effect for **Run** I am assuming that the RMSEP values for that run are correlated to some degree but are uncorrelated between runs, on the basis of the induced correlation the random effect affords.\n\nIs this assumption of independence *between* runs valid?

The results between runs will definitely be dependent, since they are based on the same data and you have overlap between your train/test sets. The question is whether this should matter when you come to compare the methods.\n\nLet's say you would perform only one run, and would find that one method is better than the others. You would then ask yourself \\- is this simply due to the specific choice of test set? This is why you repeat your test for many different train/test sets. So, in order to determine that a method is better than other methods, you run many times and in each run compare it to the other methods (you have different options of looking at the error/rank/etc). Now, if you find that a method does better on most runs, the result is what it is. I am not sure it is helpful to give a p\\-value to this.

In this sense there is no drift term.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a way think of the extra term $\\\\mu$ coming from the connection. For a smooth function $f : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$, from the smooth structure alone, you can always form the differential $Df \\\\in \\\\Gamma^{\\\\infty}(T^{\\\\ast} M)$ as smooth section of the cotangent bundle. Without a connection, you can think of $Df : TM \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ as a map between smooth manifolds, differentiate again, and this gives\n$$\nD^2 f : TTM \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nI used $D$ for the differential so as not to confuse this with the exterior derivative $d$ which would have $d^2 \\= 0$.\n\nNow if you have a [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection), you can split $TTM$ as\n$$\nTTM \\\\simeq VTM \\\\oplus HTM\n$$\ninto [vertical and horizontal sub\\-bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_and_horizontal_bundles). In this particular case both $VTM$ and $HTM$ are isomorphic to $TM$. $VTM$ is the kernel of the map $d\\\\pi : TTM \\\\to TM$ where $\\\\pi: TM \\\\to M$ is the bundle projection and this is isomorphic to $TM$. The connection allows you to \"split\" the map $d\\\\pi : TTM \\\\to TM$ obtaining an injective bundle morphism $TM \\\\to TTM$ complementary to $VTM \\\\simeq TM$ whose image I'll denoted $HTM$. The vertical bundle consists of elements of $TTM$ that are tangent to the fibres of $TM$ while the horizontal bundles consists of elements of $TTM$ that are tangent to the base $M$.\n\nTo help clarify, for a general vector bundle $\\\\pi : E \\\\to M$, the kernel $VE$ of $d\\\\pi : TE \\\\to TM$ is isomorphic to $E$ and a connection gives a splitting $TM \\\\to TE$ whose image is denoted $HE$ and such that $TE \\\\simeq VE \\\\oplus HE \\\\simeq E \\\\oplus TM$.\n\nNow, what this all has to do with \"drift\" is that under the identification $TTM \\\\simeq TM \\\\oplus TM$, the $g^{ij} \\\\partial\\_{ij}$ term comes from $VE$ \\- it's the term tangent to the fibre and corresponds to $\\\\partial\\_{ij} f \\= D^2 f$. The other term \\- the one with the connection coefficients $\\\\Gamma$ corresponds to the part that is tangent to the base $M$.\n\nIn other words, the $g^{ij} \\\\partial\\_{ij}$ part arises from differentiating while moving along the fibres of $TM$ and the $\\\\Gamma$ part arises from moving along the base $M$.\n\n**Thus the drift is measuring the change in the fibres of the bundle $TM$ as measured by the connection as the basepoint $x \\\\in M$ varies.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold (M,g), what is the geometric interpretation of the term \u03bc^\u2113 = -g^jk \u0393^\u2113_jk?\n\nA) It represents the curvature of the manifold at each point.\nB) It measures the change in the fibres of the tangent bundle TM as the basepoint on M varies, as measured by the connection.\nC) It is solely responsible for the self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\nD) It represents the average of the Hessian \u2207^2f contracted with the metric g.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The statement in option B correctly captures this concept, noting that while P(X < 0.5) = P(X \u2264 0.5) - P(X = 0.5) is technically true, the subtraction of P(X = 0.5) is unnecessary as it equals zero.

Do the packages handle multicollinearity automatically? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At first, please remember, that multicollinearity is not a binary thing, therefore it can not be *handled* or *not\\-handled* as 0 and 1\\. Every method used to handle multicollinearity will handle it to some extent \\- better or worse \\- often risking removing of important variables, when the filter is stronger or just by bad luck. One may think about it as of a trade\\-off and every cure at some point might be worse than disease.\n\nThis is the reason of such articles as [Performance of some variable selection methods when multicollinearity is present](http://automatica.dei.unipd.it/public/Schenato/PSC/2010_2011/gruppo4-Building_termo_identification/IdentificazioneTermodinamica20072008/Biblio/Biblio-PLS/Performance%20of%20some%20variable%20selection%20methods%20when%20multicollinearity.pdf), which give more complex, but better\\-than\\-general answers. The main conclusion from their existence is that different methods may perform differently in different contexts.\n\nThere are are also many methods and their variants. You should look at every method separately. You mentioned two methods \\- LASSO and forward selection:\n\n**LASSO**\n\nLASSO is a special case of *Penalized Regresion* methods. These methods were designed to handle multicollinearity. The question is if what they do is what you want. The basic property of LASSO is that from a bunch of correlated variables it tends to pick one of them and discard the others. You do not have to be satisfied with LASSO picks (see comments). You can control them to some extent with trade\\-off parameter $\\\\lambda$, which describes the strength of penalty for the coefficient values. It controls how severe levels of multicollinearity LASSO will address, but do not control what variables will be picked, when multicollinearity is met.\n\nFor a quick informations about LASSO in R, I would suggest [Glmnet Vignette](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) by Hastie \\& Qian.\n\n**Forward selection**\n\nThis method is part of group of methods called *Stepwise Regression*. They differ not only by step procedure (forward, backwards, all possibilities and others), but also by criterion \\- they use for example p\\-values, R$^2$, MSE, AIC, BIC. Then they will perform differently when challenged by multicollinearity.\n\nTo show the last very shortly \\- forward selection adding variables by R$^2$ is said to be good choice for cases with multicollinearity, while backward elimination removing by p\\-value will never drop two collinear variables in situation when they both are significant, especially when highly biased. As in the case of LASSO, you might not be satisfied with the chosen variables for many reasons.\n\n---\n\nPRACTICAL NOTE: Sometimes is much easier just to run some things and then look how they performed.

The documentation emphasizes that multicollinearity is not a binary issue and that different methods for addressing it can perform differently depending on the context. It states that \"different methods may perform differently in different contexts\" and that there's often a trade-off involved.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while LASSO does tend to select one variable from a group of correlated predictors, it's not guaranteed to always select the most important one, and its behavior can be influenced by the penalty parameter \u03bb.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect.

Therefore its complement\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{Q} \\= 1 \\- \\\\mathbb{H}$$\n\n(as given in the question) also is a projection operator. The trace of $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is its rank $h$ (see below), whence the trace of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ equals $n\\-h$.\n\nFrom its very formula it is apparent that $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is the matrix associated with the composition of two linear transformations $$\\\\mathbb{J}\\=(X^\\\\prime X)^{\\-}X^\\\\prime$$ and $X$ itself. The first ($\\\\mathbb{J}$) transforms the $n$\\-vector $y$ into the $p$\\-vector $\\\\hat\\\\beta$. The second ($X$) is a transformation from $\\\\mathbb{R}^p$ to $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ given by $\\\\hat y \\= X\\\\hat \\\\beta$. Its rank cannot exceed the smaller of those two dimensions, which in a least squares setting is always $p$ (but could be less than $p$, whenever $\\\\mathbb{J}$ is not of full rank). Consequently the rank of the composition $\\\\mathbb{H}\\=X\\\\mathbb{J}$ cannot exceed the rank of $X$. **The correct conclusion**, then, is\n\n> $\\\\text{tr} (\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\= n\\-p$ if and only if $\\\\mathbb{J}$ is of full rank; and in general $n \\\\ge \\\\text{tr} (\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\ge n\\-p$.

The difference $\\\\mathbb{Q}\\=1\\-\\\\mathbb{H}$ shows how to decompose any $n$\\-vector $y$ into a sum of vectors $$y \\= \\\\mathbb{H}(y) \\+ \\\\mathbb{Q}(y),$$ where the first can be \"predicted\" from $X$ and the second is perpendicular to it. When the $p$ columns of $X$ generate a $p$\\-dimensional space (that is, are not collinear), the rank of $\\\\mathbb{H}$ is $p$ and the rank of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n\\-p$, reflecting the $n\\-p$ additional dimensions of variation in the response that are not represented within the independent variables. The trace gives an algebraic formula for these dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### Linear Algebra Background\n\nA projection operator on a vector space $V$ (such as $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$) is a linear transformation $\\\\mathbb{P}:V\\\\to V$ (that is, an *endomorphism* of $V$) such that $\\\\mathbb{P}^2\\=\\\\mathbb{P}$.

We may therefore construct a basis $E \\\\cup F$ for $V$ for which $E \\\\subset \\\\text{Ker}(\\\\mathbb{P})$ and $F \\\\subset \\\\text{Im}(\\\\mathbb{P})$. When $V$ is finite\\-dimensional, the matrix of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ in this basis will therefore be in block\\-diagonal form, with one block (corresponding to the action of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ on $E$) all zeros and the other (corresponding to the action of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ on $F$) equal to the $f$ by $f$ identity matrix, where the dimension of $F$ is $f$. The trace of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ is the sum of the values on the diagonal and therefore must equal $f\\\\times 1 \\= f$. This number is the *rank* of $\\\\mathbb{P}$: the dimension of its image.\n\nThe trace of $1\\-\\\\mathbb{P}$ equals the trace of $1$ (equal to $n$, the dimension of $V$) minus the trace of $\\\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nThese results may be summarized with the assertion that **the trace of a projection equals its rank.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the linear regression model y = X\u03b2 + \u03b5, Q = I - X(X'X)^(-1)X' is known as the residual projection matrix.

As in most cases, I had to split big parts of code into smaller, cleaner and readable functions. I ended with many functions, that had multiple, weird parameters. Let me show an example:\n\n```\npublic void SendOrder(Order order, XmlOrder xmlOrder, Insider insider)\n{\n    string customerCode = CustomerServices\n                 .Get(insider.CustomerId)\n                 .Code;\n\n    OutputData outputData = CreateOutputData(order, xmlOrder, customerCode);\n    CreateReservations(order, customerCode, outputData);\n    PlaceOrder(order, xmlOrder, outputData, customerCode);\n}\n...\nprivate void CreateReservations(Order order, string customerCode, OutputData outputData)\n{\n    ...\n    try\n    {\n        ReservationServices.AddReservation(reservation);\n    }\n    catch (BusinessException ex)\n    {\n        Logger.Log(ex);\n        outpuData.Status = Statuses.BusnessError;\n        throw;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n(That is just demonstration code, not real one)\n\nThe problem is I had to pass for example outputData to other functions just to change it's status if an exception happens or pass customerCode to multiple functions. Class is responsible of sending multiple, not connected messages to WebService, so when I was creating it, I didn't plan to put variables connected to given order as a class state. Is it a good practice to exclude such variables from function and make them class members? Are there any guidelines for situations like this? What are your practices and solutions for such problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Should one create shareable private class member or keep variable in method scope to pass it as a second method argument?\n\nThere is a third option, which is to formally address logically separate abstractions by introducing another class.\n\n> Class is responsible of sending multiple, not connected messages to WebService, so when I was creating it, I didn't plan to put variables connected to given order as a class state.\n\nIt looks to me like you are dealing with several abstractions here.\n\nSometimes we use multiple parameters instead of creating a formal abstraction. For example, we have an `x` coordinate and a `y` coordinate, and use those as parameters in several places. They are meant to be taken as a pair \u2014 they are thus an informal abstraction. To make the a formal abstraction we can create a `Point` class that binds the `x` and `y` together. Now where ever we had passed the two variables, we pass the single abstraction. A single abstraction is better than the variable pairs in that the client using these has fewer things to worry about, and the `Point` is more type safe and less error prone that the individual coordinate values (which might have been `int`s, for example). For example, one could accidentally swap `x` and `y`; one could use `x` with the wrong `y` when dealing with multiple points.\n\nGenerally speaking, it would be a mistake to include the fields of a logically different abstraction as members of some other abstraction. While it is hard to see from the code in your example, what the class in question is doing, it doesn't look like a good home just for passing parameters to these other functions (methods?).\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to add fields to an existing class vs. create create another class, here is one way to think about it. If they are logically separate abstractions then the should have separate classes. If they are one and the same abstraction, then add the fields to the class. Check the lifetime of the individual fields. If they all have the same lifetime (and all the same lifetime as object (the class's instances)), that is consistent with being a single logical abstraction. However, if some of the fields are uninitialized after the others are properly initialized (e.g. in the constructor or an init method), and the other fields are only initialized and valid during certain operation sequences, then they belong to a logically separate abstraction, which indicates separate classes.\n\nIn your example, `order` and `xmlorder` possibly form a logically separate abstraction for you to receive as parameter in the first method.\n\nFurther, `outputData` could be upgraded (either by adding fields to it or by creating a wrapper \u2014 use the above lifetime analysis to determine) to capture (`order` and `xmlorder`) and `outputData` and `customerCode`.\n\nThus, your code could look like this:\n\n```\npublic void SendOrder(OrderBundle orderBundle, Insider insider)\n{\n    string customerCode = CustomerServices\n                 .Get(insider.CustomerId)\n                 .Code;\n\n    OutputDataBundle outputBundle = CreateOutputData(orderBundle, customerCode);\n    outputBundle.CreateReservations();\n    outputBunlde.PlaceOrder();\n}\n\n```\n\n(Quality type \\& variable names notwithstanding.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In refactoring legacy code with multiple parameters and shared variables, which approach is recommended according to the top answer?\n\nA) Always make shared variables class members to reduce parameter passing\nB) Keep all variables in method scope and pass them as parameters\nC) Create a new class to encapsulate logically separate abstractions\nD) Use global variables to avoid parameter passing altogether\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer recommends creating a new class to formally address logically separate abstractions. This approach is preferred over simply making variables class members or keeping everything in method scope. It suggests that when dealing with multiple related parameters, creating a new class (like 'OrderBundle' or 'OutputDataBundle') can improve code organization, reduce parameter passing, and make the code more maintainable.

The term \"pink\" is used because, unlike the furry animals or hair-covered monkeys they're familiar with, humans appear to have exposed skin. This unfamiliar sight of hairless, pink-skinned creatures is strange and \"freaky\" to them.

Generally I'd like to allow them to get comfortable talking about what they like rather than what they think I'd like. However, that might not work this time as the student is a non\\-native english speaker and may get less comfortable as I try to get him/her to talk more.\n\nThus far I'm thinking about watching how he/she solves different problems in different areas of math, but I would like to know if anyone has done this before or has any suggestions for evaluating a student who might not be comfortable talking much.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, I'm a non\\-native English speaker, so I can provide some insight. \n\nI think that one of the first problems would be names and notation in general. As far as I can see, there is no easy way to solve this unless you already know the customs of the country the student is coming from, but your education will probably make it easier to guess what means what. For example in my country we use $log\\_{base}number$ for general case logarithms, $lg$ for $log\\_{10}$ and $ln$ for $log\\_e$. Another example would be popular sets. In some countries 0 is a natural number and in some other countries it isn't. Another example would be popular trigonometric functions. In my country for example secant and cosecant are considered deprecated and aren't used. Same thing with grads as angle measurement units.\n\nProblems with this part can be especially tricky because they can stay undetected for a long time. I've seen some math problems whose solutions depend on whether zero is a natural number or not. Another example here can be integrals. As far as I can see the most popular name in English for operation opposite of finding a derivative is antiderivation. In my area that's called indefinite integration and the indefinite part if often omitted.\n\nStill I think that most of the notational problems can be solved with Wikipedia.\n\nNext part would be names of fields of mathematics and popular theorems. How big problems this is going to be is closely related to which language terms come from. Sometimes terms are going to be shared between languages and sometimes there will be no direct translation. For example in my language, there is no term for calculus. Instead we use mathematical analysis, which as far as I know is superset of calculus.  \n\nAlso in some cultures some theorems are named after famous mathematicians and in some other cultures they are named after what the theorem describes. I can't find any examples right now, but I know I encountered such problems when asking few questions here. \n\nAnother problem could be non\\-existence of a concept. For example I was unable to find any mention of [Ivan Vsevolodovich Meshcherskiy's equation](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=sr&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fru.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%25D0%25A3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE) [(original article here](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE)) for bodies with variable mass in any English language web\\-sites. Here it's considered one of the fundamental rocketry equations, right next to Tsiolkovsky's formula. While the example is related more to physics than mathematics, be prepared to find similar examples in mathematics if the student is coming from a different culture.\n\nSince you said that student knows some English, here's my recommendation: Try starting a conversation about some topic in English and see if student is familiar with it. If it doesn't ring a bell, be ready to provide simple examples related to the area. I sometimes had problems finding exact name for some field of mathematics but immediately recognized it as soon as I saw a few simple problems. Another good idea would be to make a list of alternative names for every operation and see if some of them are familiar.\n\nYet another important thing is to have at least some familiarity with mathematics program which the student followed. Sometimes focus of what's studied in classes can be a bit different than what's written on paper. I remember now back when I was in secondary school we had formal mathematical proofs in books and they were supposed to be a part of the curriculum, but teachers in schools just decided that proofs are not important and did not teach them. Also in some schools less attention was payed to proper use of terminology. I know some of my friends who didn't know what was derivative and it's graphical representations, but knew that $x^2{'}\\=2x$ and same thing for integrals. Another point can be some obvious areas which may have been skipped. When was in secondary school, we didn't learn almost any probability and statistics and did very little work with percentages. On the other hand I see that in some other countries it's expected that someone who has graduated from primary school can without any problems calculate his interest rate.\n\nI can't think of anything else to add at the moment..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A math professor is interviewing a non-native English speaking high school student to assess their mathematical knowledge and interests.

This method maximizes the use of the screen's vertical resolution and takes advantage of the percent marks often provided on oscilloscope screens, making the measurement more accurate and easier to perform.\n\nOption A is incorrect because increasing amplitude beyond screen limits would make measurement impossible.

Regarding cases 1 and 2 I'm not sure, but I'm thinking only changes of type 2 (Theirs) should prompt manual inspection.

From the wiki article:\n\n> Valley Girl (or Val, Val Gal) is a stereotype leveled at a socio\\-economic and ethnic class of American women who can be described as colloquial English\\-speaking, materialistic, self\\-centered, hedonistic, and often sexually promiscuous. Valspeak is also a form of this trait, based on an exaggerated version of '80s California English.\n\nThe phrase is used as an expression of disgust.

The phrase gained popularity as part of the broader Valley Girl culture and was featured in Frank Zappa's song \"Valley Girl,\" but it wasn't coined by him.

So I created LiveCD, booted from it, plugged external SSD. \n\nWith the help of GParted I converted the SSD to GPT and created partitions. Then I started installation as usual. Of course, I used the EFI partition and installed the bootloader on an external SSD.\n\nAfter installation, and upon rebooting, in the UEFI I found 2 boot entries \"Ubuntu\". Each of them works great: Kubuntu loads and works. But, when I choose UEFI boot entry \"UEFI TS512\\...\" (the label of my external SSD), for a moment (less than second) the string `Couldn't open /EFI/BOOT/fallback.efi 14` appears and then it changes to a screen showing `Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported`. \n\nSo, what do I need to do in order to make this system work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your SSD is considered \"removable media\" by UEFI, so the place for the bootloader which UEFI runs is actually /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi from the SSD's EFI partition. You might have to copy the Ubuntu bootloader(s) from /EFI/ubuntu there and rename them to bootx64\\.efi. If you are running secure boot, copy /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi and also copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/grubx64\\.efi (that's the signed version). Without secure boot, just copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64\\.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64\\.efi (the unsigned version). The grub.cfg file should be in /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg (and that should be just a 3 liner which brings in the maintained grub.cfg from the regular /boot/grub location.\n\n---\n\nThe removable media's EFI partition is set up just like the hard disk's EFI. FAT filesystem, flagged bootable, (and created with the efi type, \"ef\", check the type list, might have zeros too in some tools). Look at the live install media, it meets the criteria. (FAT filesystem, flagged bootable, directory /EFI/Boot, efi bootloader).\n\n---\n\nWith the SSD booting alone, you might have to edit the grub.cfg files after you add two hard disks. The two grub.cfg files are in (EFI partition)/EFI/ubuntu.grub.cfg (a three liner) and /boot/grub/grub.cfg (the full config file). Change any hd0 references to hd2 (assuming the hard disks now get 0 and 1\\), and if you see any /dev/sda references, change those to /dev/sdc...

When an external SSD is treated as removable media by UEFI systems, the bootloader needs to be in a specific location: /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi on the SSD's EFI partition. Simply installing the bootloader to the EFI partition (option A) is not sufficient, as UEFI looks for a specific file name and location for removable media. \n\nOption C is incorrect because GPT is preferred for UEFI systems, and converting to MBR would not solve the bootloader location issue. Option D is also incorrect, as creating multiple boot entries doesn't address the core problem of the bootloader's location.\n\nThe correct procedure involves copying the Ubuntu bootloader (either shimx64.efi for Secure Boot or grubx64.efi for non-Secure Boot) from /EFI/ubuntu to /EFI/Boot and renaming it to bootx64.efi.
