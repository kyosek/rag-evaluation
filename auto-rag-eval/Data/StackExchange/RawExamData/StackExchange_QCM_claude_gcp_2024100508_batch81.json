I'm assuming your actual code has it.\n\nThe reason your code fails with a syntax error is because the command within the FOR IN() clause is executed via a `cmd /C yourCommandHere` command. When the implicit `cmd /C` command is parsed, it treats `=` as a token delimiter unless it is escaped or quoted. Any consecutive string of token delimiters is converted into a single `<space>` before your command is actually executed in a new CMD thread using command line semantics. The list of token delimiters is `,` `;` `=` `<space>` `<non-breaking space>` and `<tab>`.\n\nSo quoting the command will eliminate the syntax error:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A \"RND=%%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1\"') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nAs will escaping the `=`:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A RND^=%%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nBut you don't really need to assign the random number to a variable. The FOR IN() command is executed within a command line context, and SET /A will print the computed value to stdout when run within a command line context. So the following also eliminates any syntax error with effectively the same results:\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A %%RANDOM%%*5/32768+1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nHere is a simpler method to give a result from 1 to 5 (random mod 5 \\+ 1\\):\n\n```\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO FOR /F %%j IN ('SET /A %%RANDOM%% %% 5 + 1') DO ECHO SOME[%%i] %%j\n\n```\n\nBut I seriously doubt any of the above fixes give your desired result.\n\nThere is something very peculiar going on with the value of `%RANDOM%`. Your use of `%%RANDOM%%` properly causes the expression to be evaluated each iteration. But for some reason, the random number is nearly constant for any given run. Once in a while, one of the iterations will vary, but for most runs, each iteration gets a constant value. I think it must have something to do with the random number generator seed value. Perhaps the random number generator is initiated with a seed value each time a CMD session starts, and the seed value is only changing very slowly. Remember that the FOR IN() clause is executed in a new CMD session.\n\nHere is a test program that demonstrates that the `%%test%%` is properly getting re\\-evaluated each iteration. It also shows how `%%random%%` is remaining nearly constant within a run.\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal\nset test=0\nfor /l %%I in (1 1 5) do for /f \"delims=\" %%J in ('echo %%test%% %%random%%') do (\n  echo %%J\n  set \"test=%%I\n)\n\n```\n\nHere is the output from 2 runs of the above code. Note how the 1st run has one variation in the random number. The 2nd run has a constant random value.\n\n```\nC:\\test> test\n0 20369\n1 20373\n2 20373\n3 20373\n4 20373\n\nC:\\test> test\n0 20379\n1 20379\n2 20379\n3 20379\n4 20379\n\n```\n\nThere really is no reason to put the random number computation within a FOR /F IN('command') clause. Everything is much simpler if you use SET /A with delayed expansion directly within your outer loop.\n\nI believe the following may be what you are looking for:\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal enableDelayedExpansion\nSET SOME[1]=\"AA\"\nSET SOME[2]=\"BB\"\nSET SOME[3]=\"CC\"\nSET SOME[4]=\"DD\"\nSET SOME[5]=\"EE\"\nFOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO (\n  set /a rand=!random!%%5+1\n  for %%N in (!rand!) do echo %%i: SOME[%%N]=!SOME[%%N]!\n)\n\n```\n\nHere is some sample output:\n\n```\nC:\\test>test\n1: SOME[3]=\"CC\"\n2: SOME[5]=\"EE\"\n3: SOME[2]=\"BB\"\n4: SOME[2]=\"BB\"\n5: SOME[5]=\"EE\"\n\n```\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHere is better evidence that the randomizer for CMD session is reseeded, and the seed changes only slowly.\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal enableDelayedExpansion\n\necho Within a single CMD session, every ^^!random^^! gets a new value.\nfor /l %%N in (1 1 10) do call echo !time! !random! !random!\n\necho(\n\nsetlocal disableDelayedExpansion\necho But each CMD session !random! is reseeded,\necho and the seed only changes once per second,\necho and the inital value changes slowly:\nfor /l %%N in (1 1 30) do cmd /v:on /c \"echo !time! !random! !random!&for /l %%A in (1 1 50000) do @rem\"\n\n```\n\n\\-\\-OUTPUT\\-\\-\n\n```\nWithin a single CMD session, every !random! gets a new value.\n11:12:10.37 17810 1733\n11:12:10.37 8919 24464\n11:12:10.37 9931 2137\n11:12:10.37 28574 16630\n11:12:10.37 30379 23234\n11:12:10.37 22410 31740\n11:12:10.38 15479 14080\n11:12:10.38 812 23616\n11:12:10.38 1384 25909\n11:12:10.38 2733 1947\n\nBut each CMD session !random! is reseeded,\nand the seed only changes once per second,\nand the inital value changes slowly:\n11:12:10.39 4552 6316\n11:12:10.50 4552 6316\n11:12:10.61 4552 6316\n11:12:10.71 4552 6316\n11:12:10.82 4552 6316\n11:12:10.92 4552 6316\n11:12:11.03 4555 17064\n11:12:11.14 4555 17064\n11:12:11.24 4555 17064\n11:12:11.35 4555 17064\n11:12:11.45 4555 17064\n11:12:11.56 4555 17064\n11:12:11.67 4555 17064\n11:12:11.77 4555 17064\n11:12:11.88 4555 17064\n11:12:11.99 4555 17064\n11:12:12.09 4559 27813\n11:12:12.20 4559 27813\n11:12:12.30 4559 27813\n11:12:12.41 4559 27813\n11:12:12.51 4559 27813\n11:12:12.62 4559 27813\n11:12:12.73 4559 27813\n11:12:12.83 4559 27813\n11:12:12.94 4559 27813\n11:12:13.04 4562 5793\n11:12:13.15 4562 5793\n11:12:13.26 4562 5793\n11:12:13.36 4562 5793\n11:12:13.47 4562 5793\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Windows batch script, you want to generate random numbers between 1 and 5 for each iteration of a loop.

It performs the random number generation within the loop, not in a separate CMD session (unlike options A and B).\n3. It avoids the issue of the random seed being reset for each iteration, which can happen with options A and B due to their use of FOR /F.\n4. Option D doesn't use delayed expansion, so it would evaluate %RANDOM% only once at the beginning of the script execution.\n\nThe documentation shows that when using FOR /F to execute commands, a new CMD session is started for each iteration, which can lead to the same or very similar random numbers being generated due to how the random seed is initialized in new CMD sessions.

BBEdit does not only run your script, but also adds an `exit`. There is no option in BBEdit to remove this `exit` command. But BBEdit is highly scriptable and there are some workarounds. You can create a BBEdit Script (from the Scripts menu) that runs, but personally I think creating Service is the easiest one (run some AppleScript that opens your script in the Terminal as you would have done manually).\n\nIn this treat you have provided a [script](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/300968/55028) that actually does what you want."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is using BBEdit to write and test Python scripts.

Which of the following approaches would best achieve this goal?\n\nA) Modify BBEdit's internal configuration to remove the automatic 'exit' command\nB) Create a BBEdit Script from the Scripts menu to run the Python code\nC) Use the default \"Run in Terminal\" command in BBEdit\nD) Create an AppleScript-based Service that opens the script in Terminal manually\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. BBEdit doesn't provide a built-in option to remove the automatic 'exit' command that it adds when running scripts.\n\nB) Partially correct, but not the best solution. While creating a BBEdit Script is possible, the question suggests this isn't the easiest method.\n\nC) Incorrect. The default \"Run in Terminal\" command in BBEdit will still add the 'exit' command, closing the terminal after script execution.\n\nD) Correct. Creating an AppleScript-based Service that opens the script in Terminal manually is described as the easiest workaround. This method would mimic the process of manually running the script in Terminal, allowing the environment to remain active after script completion.\n\nThis solution addresses the user's desire to have an active prompt after script execution, similar to running the script directly from the shell or Python interpreter.

It uses the `x-magento-init` script type, which is the recommended way to initialize JavaScript components in Magento 2. This approach:\n\n1. Separates the JavaScript logic into its own file (quick-view.js).\n2. Uses the Magento 2 module structure (Vendor_Module).\n3.

So to apply this one must embed a complex algebraic variety as a real subvariety of a Euclidean space.

You can't finish anything until that is done \\- As others have suggested marksdwarfs are the way to get this done. Even an untrained marksdwarf may hit something sometimes so make a squad and just tell them to station on the floor above. They will fire through the holes and eventually kill all the goblins.\n\nOnce they are dead, you can build your hatch and be happy in the fact the goblins are now doomed.\n\nPersonally, i'd make a ramp and have the hatch a floor higher, so they drop 2z levels into the water \\- the first drop will stun them, and you'll be able to fill it to 7/7 and make sure they drown without them climbing back out :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Dwarf Fortress, a player has created a pit to trap goblins and attempted to fill it with water to eliminate them. However, the plan was unsuccessful due to incomplete construction.

First, using marksdwarfs to kill the goblins from above is safe and effective, even with untrained dwarves. This eliminates the immediate threat. Once the goblins are dead, the dwarves can safely complete the construction by adding hatch covers over the holes without fear. Finally, filling the pit with water to level 7/7 and ensuring a floor above will create an effective drowning trap for future use. This approach addresses the current problem and improves the trap's design for future effectiveness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the pit isn't properly constructed for drowning, and goblins can survive in partially filled water. Option B is dangerous and unnecessary. Option D is impossible due to the dwarves' fear and the presence of live goblins.

If the drawing are wrong, could you please explain how we would draw the full circuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Your first picture is almost correct, but you can't connect the top and ground parts directly. If you would connect them you would build a short circuit and you had no voltage over your transistor circuit anymore.  \n\nThe way the diagram in the book is drawn is a typical way to show where the (\\+) and the (\\-) of the voltage source is connected. I have drawn a battery (red) in the circuit to show what exactly that means. At the top you have the positive voltage of say 1\\.2V and the ground symbols are connected to the negative terminal and are interpreted as 0V.\n2. C is not connected to 1\\.2V or ground at the output (like you have drawn it), but by the transistors. That's the whole purpose of this circuit. C is the output that (dependent on the input signals) is either connected by the upper two transistors to the positive terminal (1\\.2V) or the negative terminal (0V). I have drawn these two paths in blue and green.  \n\nThis way the circuit fulfills the role as a logic gate: The two inputs A and B both have to be at LOW potential for the upper two transistors to be conductive. So with both inputs LOW, the output C is connected to logic HIGH (the supply voltage). The lower two transistors are not conductive in this case. But if one of the inputs is at HIGH potential, one of the two upper transistors does not conduct anymore, so the output is not connected to the supply. Instead one of the lower transistors gets conducting and the outputs is \"pulled LOW\".  \n\nThe circuit is representing a NOR gate.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mk6Rx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mk6Rx.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the CMOS NOR gate circuit described, what would happen to the output C if input A is set to HIGH (1.2V) and input B is set to LOW (0V)?\n\nA) C would be connected to 1.2V (HIGH) through the upper two P-type transistors\nB) C would be connected to ground (LOW) through both lower N-type transistors\nC) C would be connected to ground (LOW) through only one of the lower N-type transistors\nD) C would be floating, not connected to either 1.2V or ground\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When input A is HIGH (1.2V), it turns off the upper-left P-type transistor and turns on the lower-left N-type transistor. The upper-right P-type transistor remains on (because B is LOW), but it can't pull C up to 1.2V due to the upper-left transistor being off. Meanwhile, the lower-left N-type transistor provides a path from C to ground. The lower-right N-type transistor remains off because B is LOW. Thus, C is connected to ground (LOW) through only one of the lower N-type transistors, specifically the one controlled by input A."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/23", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/143167", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/58848/"], "docs_id": 143167, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to build my Tiny Death Star as fast as possible, and I check in on it a couple times each day.

As explained in the documentation, iOS caches TLS sessions to improve performance. Adding a \".\" character at the end of the host for the first connection tricks the system into treating it as a different host, forcing a new TLS session.

However, it emphasizes the importance of considering your audience and using such phrases wisely. The advice given is to be mindful of who you're communicating with and to have a good reason for using Latin terms.

Sync logs with the upstream WSUS show no errors.\n\n**update 2**: So it seems as if there's something weird with my upstream. I've found that if I install a new WSUS instance \\& sync it from Microsoft, all works perfectly well. If I make it a downstream replica of my existing WSUS server, either during the configuration, or afterwards, it breaks. Even more strange, my upstream itself and another existing replica appear to be functioning just fine. It looks as if I'm just going to build new WSUS instances in all 3 sites and start fresh, ignoring the existing upstream.\n\n**update 3**: I built a new WSUS upstream server, started clean so as to not bring over whatever weirdness was going on in the original upstream's DB. Pointed my 2 replicas at my new upstream. Everything was fine for several days. 5 days ago the replicas stopped getting status updates from clients again. WTF?!?!\n\n**update 4**: I have logged a support request with Microsoft on this, hopefully some good will come out of it.\n\n**update 5**: After Microsoft product support spent countless hours checking and re\\-checking all the same stuff I'd already checked, I suspect I have stumbled upon the cause. Our Junior sysadmin recently discovered [Local Update Publisher](http://localupdatepubl.sourceforge.net/) and started using it to push Adobe \\& Java updates to workstations. The time of Local Update Publisher's installation coincides perfectly with the time the downstream clients last reported status. I am going through the product documentation to determine what I need to do to fix this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I had a similar issue not to long ago when migrating to WSUS 3\\.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2008 R2\\. After quite a few frustrating hours I finally resolved it with KB2720211\\. I'm not sure why it worked since it doesn't seem to directly address the error code I was receiving from clients at the time (800b0001\\), however it seemed logical to make sure the WSUS version was fully patched before getting further into diagnostics.\n\nYou can use the instructions from <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2720211>\n\nSince my setup only involved one WSUS server I only had to use the following instructions from the site after downloading the patch.\n\n1\\.Set up WSUS. To do this, at a command prompt, type one of the following commands, as applicable to your system:  \n\n`WSUS-KB2720211-x64.exe /q C:\\MySetup.log  \n\nWSUS-KB2720211-x86.exe /q C:\\MySetup.log` \n\nThe update will install immediately, without any prompts. \n\n2\\.Review the setup log to verify the upgrade was successful. To do this, at a command prompt, type `C:\\MySetup.log`.\n\n3\\.Make sure that IIS and the WSUS service are stopped. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands:\n\n`iisreset/stop  \n\nnet stop wsusservice`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is experiencing issues with a newly migrated WSUS 3.0 SP2 server on Windows Server 2008 R2. Clients are unable to find updates and don't report status. After investigating, the administrator discovers error code 0x8024400E in the WindowsUpdate.log file. What is the recommended first step to resolve this issue?\n\nA) Decline, approve, and then decline the Office 2003 SP1 update\nB) Run the Microsoft WSUS client & server diagnostic tools\nC) Install KB2720211 patch on the WSUS server\nD) Rebuild all WSUS instances and start fresh\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C) Install KB2720211 patch on the WSUS server. \n\nAccording to the top answer in the documentation, a similar issue was resolved by applying KB2720211 to the WSUS server. Even though the error code mentioned (800b0001) doesn't exactly match the one in the question (0x8024400E), the responder suggests that ensuring the WSUS version is fully patched is a logical first step before proceeding with further diagnostics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while declining/approving/declining the Office 2003 SP1 update was mentioned as a potential fix in old blogs, it didn't resolve the issue for the original poster.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation states that the Microsoft WSUS client & server diagnostic tools don't run on x64 systems, which is likely the case for a Windows Server 2008 R2 installation.\n\nOption D, while potentially a solution, is an extreme measure and should not be the first step. It's better to try less drastic solutions, such as patching, before completely rebuilding the WSUS infrastructure."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/10", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/145746", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/72711/"], "docs_id": 145746, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am familiar with the basics of how to present a problem to a machine learning algorithm using binary encodings. I am also familiar with, but still learning about, feature selection/extraction and construction. However, **I am wondering if there is a term or keyword for the way in which you deicde to encode your problem for an algorithm, and how someone can improve their ability to present this problem to an algorithm.** I believe this to be related to, but **distinct from feature selection and construction**. I am looking for a general answer, and a topic/keyword to continue learning afterwards, but I have provided a few examples below to illustrate where I have found difficulties:\n\nFor example, a common problem is how to solve a maze in under 100 steps by representing each step (forward, left, right, backwards) using binary values 00, 01, 10, 11\\. When presenting this to a genetic algorithm you would then use two bits for every step for 200 total bits. But I'm not sure I could easily present this same problem to a neural network.\n\nFor a neural network, days of the year could be represented by using 365 individual nodes, of which only one would be activated and the rest would have a value of 0\\. When combined with other features, perhaps one or two, they seem to be dwarfed by the number of other dimensions created using 365 input nodes to represent a year. We could reduce the dimensions by using th 52 weeks of the year, but at the cost of losing information about individual days of the week. Surely, there must be a better way to think of this problem.\n\n**\\*Also if there are other methods than binary encodings, please indulge.**\n\nADDEDUM:\n\nTruth be told, what I am asking is so basic it seems to be glossed over as trivial in many machine learning tutorials. They may give an example, such as the maze above, and quickly explain how to encode this to the algorithm at hand, but I have seen very little material which focuses solely on the many different ways a problem can be encoded and presented to an algorithm... or else I am not looking in the right places which is why I asked for some keywords. This lack of focus is surprising to me considering how important it is to ask the machine the proper question and in the correct form, which in my opinion, supercedes even the subject of feature selection which would come after the encoding patterns have been figured out; technically, the features are selected first and then they are encoded second. Surely there are more ways than one to think of a given problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell from the comments on the original post, analyzing a 2 x 2 contingency table doesn't make sense for these data. Instead you would want to compare the count of *c1* out of the total observed count, and compare that to 0\\.10\\. \n\nYou might use an exact binomial test or a chi\\-square test goodness\\-of\\-fit test. So in R, for group 3:\n\n```\nyes = 13\nno  = 19\nbinom.test(yes, (yes+no), 0.1)\n\n   ### number of successes = 13, number of trials = 32, p-value = 5.507e-06\n   ### alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.1\n   ### 95 percent confidence interval:\n   ###  0.2369841 0.5935508\n   ### sample estimates:\n   ### probability of success \n   ###                0.40625 \n\nyes = 13\nno  = 19\nchisq.test(c(yes, no), p=c(.10, .90))\n\n   ### Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n   ### \n   ### X-squared = 33.347, df = 1, p-value = 7.709e-09\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is investigating the prevalence of a rare genetic trait in a population. The trait is known to occur in 10% of the general population. In a sample of 32 individuals from a specific ethnic group, 13 were found to have the trait. Which statistical test and conclusion is most appropriate for determining if this group's prevalence differs significantly from the general population?\n\nA) A 2x2 contingency table analysis should be used. The result shows no significant difference from the general population.\n\nB) An exact binomial test should be used. The p-value of 5.507e-06 indicates the trait prevalence in this group is significantly different from 10%.\n\nC) A chi-square goodness-of-fit test should be used. The result (X-squared = 33.347, p-value = 7.709e-09) is not statistically significant.\n\nD) A t-test should be used to compare the sample mean to the population mean of 10%. The result shows no significant difference.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The exact binomial test is appropriate for this scenario as we're comparing a single proportion to a known population value. The very low p-value (5.507e-06) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the true proportion in this group is 0.10.

I'be been thinking about this and I am not coming up with anything. My understanding is that extensive variables (at least wrt usual energies) scales with mass or length (system size). It also seems that some 'energies' depend upon the model used, such as how strong the interactions are in neighbors of atoms or dipoles, etc., or whether one is considering chemical potential or not, etc.\n\nAny good suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, that is entirely true. All this \"junk\" is usually separated in two categories: *space debris* (man\\-made), and *micro\\-meteoroids* (natural origins). \n\nMicro\\-meteoroids\n-----------------\n\nMicro\\-meteoroids are not as common as you might think. Even when you fly straight through the asteroid belt, micrometeorite impacts will be extremely unlikely. This is because small objects (dust, comet debris,\u00a0...) get pushed out of the Solar system by solar radiation pressure, are very likely to fall on a nearby asteroid, be caught in some planet's gravity field (Jupiter, mostly), etc. In short, small celestial bodies (in the order of cm or less) generally have a very short life span on astronomical time scales. \n\nThey *can* however be a problem near Jupiter for instance, which, because of its large mass, is a gravitational sink for these small objects. Even though they won't live there for very long, there are just so many of them flowing into Jupiter's gravity well all the time that they might just pose a problem. They haven't caused any major problems in exploration missions yet, but nevertheless, the [Galileo spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_%28spacecraft%29) and most others flying to or past Jupiter were equipped with micro\\-meteoroid impact protection systems around the most critical components. \n\nSpace debris\n------------\n\nSpace debris is a very active field of study. As it is man\\-made, it is only a problem of any size for spacecraft *near the Earth*. The importance of most near\\-Earth satellites and the threat space debris poses to them is why [NORAD keeps track of most space debris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#NORAD.2C_Gabbard_and_Kessler) in the vicinity of Earth. Information gathered by NORAD is used by space mission designers, so that they can design a spacecraft's trajectory such that it avoids collisions with larger (\\>\\~10cm) chunks of space debris. \n\nAlthough this prevents most catastrophic collisions, it is very difficult if not impossible to track all the smaller objects (\\<\\~10cm). There are unfortunately many millions of such things close to the Eartch, which sometimes indeed leads to impact. Solar panels from the ISS returned to Earth are riddled with holes, dents, scratches, etc., all resulting from impacts with space debris. The ISS has a lot of shields all over able to withstand impact with objects smaller than a few mm. For instance, the windows of the ISS are not simply a few layers of glass; there's pressure panes, primary shield, secondary shield, scratch panes, etc. Teh overall thickness of a window can exceed 40cm. The shield in front of a window is designed to be strong enough to break any impacting particle up into lower\\-mass dust, which then sprays out over the deliberate spacing between the primary shield and auxiliary pressure pane, the latter of which is then able to withstand the lower energy impact of the dust. It's kind of like bullet\\-proof glass, but then for bullets travelling several km/s :) \n\nSpace debris is not *really* a problem yet, because even though there is a large number of objects orbiting the Earth, the volume they fly through is so vast that the average density is still very low. But, when things like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#China) happen, there is a *major* impact on many space missions, existing and future ones. When not taken seriously between now and \\~15 years, space debris might indeed become a real threat, possibly even leading to the [Kessler syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary difference between micro-meteoroids and space debris in terms of their impact on space missions?\n\nA) Micro-meteoroids pose a greater threat to missions near Jupiter, while space debris is mainly a concern for Earth-orbiting satellites.\n\nB) Micro-meteoroids are tracked by NORAD, while space debris is too small to be tracked effectively.\n\nC) Micro-meteoroids have a longer lifespan in space compared to space debris.\n\nD) Space debris is more likely to cause damage to the International Space Station than micro-meteoroids.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The passage indicates that micro-meteoroids are more of a concern near planets like Jupiter due to its strong gravitational pull, which concentrates these natural particles. The Galileo spacecraft, for instance, had special protection against micro-meteoroids when exploring Jupiter. In contrast, space debris is described as a man-made problem primarily affecting spacecraft near Earth. The text mentions that NORAD tracks space debris near Earth, and that it poses a significant threat to Earth-orbiting satellites and the International Space Station. While both can potentially impact space missions, their areas of primary concern differ based on their origin and location in space."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/24", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/152127", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/19294/"], "docs_id": 152127, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to create a circle shapefile feature in QGIS, like it is possible to do in ArcMap?\n\nI am trying to digitise a map wich features roundabouts, which I'd like to be part of the same polyline as the rest of the road.

It also works well over combined symbols like `AB` in most cases.\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\makeatletter\n\\let\\save@mathaccent\\mathaccent\n\\newcommand*\\if@single[3]{%\n  \\setbox0\\hbox{${\\mathaccent\"0362{#1}}^H$}%\n  \\setbox2\\hbox{${\\mathaccent\"0362{\\kern0pt#1}}^H$}%\n  \\ifdim\\ht0=\\ht2 #3\\else #2\\fi\n  }\n%The bar will be moved to the right by a half of \\macc@kerna, which is computed by amsmath:\n\\newcommand*\\rel@kern[1]{\\kern#1\\dimexpr\\macc@kerna}\n%If there's a superscript following the bar, then no negative kern may follow the bar;\n%an additional {} makes sure that the superscript is high enough in this case:\n\\newcommand*\\widebar[1]{\\@ifnextchar^{{\\wide@bar{#1}{0}}}{\\wide@bar{#1}{1}}}\n%Use a separate algorithm for single symbols:\n\\newcommand*\\wide@bar[2]{\\if@single{#1}{\\wide@bar@{#1}{#2}{1}}{\\wide@bar@{#1}{#2}{2}}}\n\\newcommand*\\wide@bar@[3]{%\n  \\begingroup\n  \\def\\mathaccent##1##2{%\n%Enable nesting of accents:\n    \\let\\mathaccent\\save@mathaccent\n%If there's more than a single symbol, use the first character instead (see below):\n    \\if#32 \\let\\macc@nucleus\\first@char \\fi\n%Determine the italic correction:\n    \\setbox\\z@\\hbox{$\\macc@style{\\macc@nucleus}_{}$}%\n    \\setbox\\tw@\\hbox{$\\macc@style{\\macc@nucleus}{}_{}$}%\n    \\dimen@\\wd\\tw@\n    \\advance\\dimen@-\\wd\\z@\n%Now \\dimen@ is the italic correction of the symbol.\n    \\divide\\dimen@ 3\n    \\@tempdima\\wd\\tw@\n    \\advance\\@tempdima-\\scriptspace\n%Now \\@tempdima is the width of the symbol.\n    \\divide\\@tempdima 10\n    \\advance\\dimen@-\\@tempdima\n%Now \\dimen@ = (italic correction / 3) - (Breite / 10)\n    \\ifdim\\dimen@>\\z@ \\dimen@0pt\\fi\n%The bar will be shortened in the case \\dimen@<0 !\n    \\rel@kern{0.6}\\kern-\\dimen@\n    \\if#31\n      \\overline{\\rel@kern{-0.6}\\kern\\dimen@\\macc@nucleus\\rel@kern{0.4}\\kern\\dimen@}%\n      \\advance\\dimen@0.4\\dimexpr\\macc@kerna\n%Place the combined final kern (-\\dimen@) if it is >0 or if a superscript follows:\n      \\let\\final@kern#2%\n      \\ifdim\\dimen@<\\z@ \\let\\final@kern1\\fi\n      \\if\\final@kern1 \\kern-\\dimen@\\fi\n    \\else\n      \\overline{\\rel@kern{-0.6}\\kern\\dimen@#1}%\n    \\fi\n  }%\n  \\macc@depth\\@ne\n  \\let\\math@bgroup\\@empty \\let\\math@egroup\\macc@set@skewchar\n  \\mathsurround\\z@ \\frozen@everymath{\\mathgroup\\macc@group\\relax}%\n  \\macc@set@skewchar\\relax\n  \\let\\mathaccentV\\macc@nested@a\n%The following initialises \\macc@kerna and calls \\mathaccent:\n  \\if#31\n    \\macc@nested@a\\relax111{#1}%\n  \\else\n%If the argument consists of more than one symbol, and if the first token is\n%a letter, use that letter for the computations:\n    \\def\\gobble@till@marker##1\\endmarker{}%\n    \\futurelet\\first@char\\gobble@till@marker#1\\endmarker\n    \\ifcat\\noexpand\\first@char A\\else\n      \\def\\first@char{}%\n    \\fi\n    \\macc@nested@a\\relax111{\\first@char}%\n  \\fi\n  \\endgroup\n}\n\\makeatother\n\\newcommand\\test[1]{%\n$#1{M}$ $#1{A}$ $#1{g}$ $#1{\\beta}$ $#1{\\mathcal A}^q$\n$#1{AB}^\\sigma$ $#1{H}^C$ $#1{\\sin z}$ $#1{W}_n$}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\test\\widebar\n\n\\test\\overline\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nHere is my previous simpler implementation; the intended use is for single symbols.

Whatever is the favored treatment to reduce negative outcomes among those with the highest scores, that treatment should be applied to everyone above a certain cutpoint, determined by resources. E.g., if we have the resources to treat only one tenth, then we set a single cutpoint to include one tenth. \n\nBeing one\\-dimensional, the risk score, I contend, can tell us nothing about the best alternative for each person among some set of multiple treatment options. If we truly want to reduce incidence of infection, we offer the best treatment we have, to everyone we have the resources to treat. \n\nTo put it another way, I think it would be illogical to use two cutpoints to create three risk groups (high, medium, and low); to give the high group the most reliable treatment; and to give the medium group some alternative treatment.

So go to your instance and check if your network card is correctly bridged. You can configure that in your Vagrantfile. For example my line for my Macbook to bridge the network to my WLAN card. \n\n```\nserver.vm.network \"public_network\", bridge:'en0: WLAN (AirPort)'\n\n```\n\nperhaps that help for your problem. \n\n<http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/public_network.html>\n\nCheck your VBox settings.

The apt-get errors mention inability to connect to 192.168.0.0:59875\n3. The routing table shows a default gateway of 10.0.2.2\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of the installation failure and the recommended solution?\n\nA) The VM's network interface is not properly bridged. The solution is to add a public network configuration in the Vagrantfile.\n\nB) The package manager is misconfigured. The solution is to run apt-get update and try again.\n\nC) The Ubuntu security repositories are down. The solution is to wait and try again later.\n\nD) The VM's DNS settings are incorrect.

While the VM can ping google.com, it's trying to reach Ubuntu repositories through an incorrect IP (192.168.0.0). The recommended solution is to add a public network configuration in the Vagrantfile to properly bridge the network.

I greatly doubt that is what you are trying to say.\n\nHere is what I suspect you mean by your first example:\n\n> Do not claim that your intelligence justifies your idleness.\n\nMore simply\n\n> Your intelligence does not justify your idleness.\n\nYour mention of an \"instrumental case\" suggests to me that you are trying to use a form that exists in your native language. Case is seldom a useful concept in English, which has only remnants of inflection.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI shall not try to explain differences between Russian and English because I know no Russian. I know that Russian that suffixes on the ends of words (inflections) heavily affect meaning. English is much, much less reliant on suffixes to create meaning. English, however, is heavily dependent on lexical means to create meaning. For example,\n\n\"Justify\" may be used in the following way\n\n> Person X justified his actions\n\nmeans \n\n> Person X argued **successfully** that his actions were correct.\n\nNotice that the subject is a person, and the meaning relates to the phyical **action** of speaking or writing as well as **implying** a result from that action.\n\nSome people also say\n\n> Person X justified his actions\n\nto mean\n\n> Person X tried to argue that his actions were correct, but was not successful\n\nI prefer using \"try to justify\" in that case to avoid ambiguity. But again, a person is the subject, and the meaning relates to a physical action.\n\nHowever, \"justify\" can be used in a different way\n\n> Y justifies X's actions\n\nmeans \n\n> Y is the reason that X's actions were correct\n\nNow the subject is not a person, and the meaning does not relate to a physical action, but rather to a logical relationship.\n\nYour example was trying to squeeze both meanings into a single sentence. \n\nNow you can do many things in English, but you cannot make a single utterance of one word convey two different meanings in the same sentence. You could use a word in two different senses in one sentence if the word is used two different times. That would be grammatical, but would **usually** be bad style. \n\n> Don't try to justify your idleness by saying that your intelligence justifies it\n\nThat is grammatical, but I would never write it. The shifting meanings of \"justify\" make it confusing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best expresses the idea \"Do not claim that your intelligence justifies your idleness\" while avoiding ambiguity and maintaining proper grammar?\n\nA) Do not justify your laziness that you are smart.\nB) Do not justify your laziness by your intelligence.\nC) Your intelligence does not justify your idleness.\nD) Do not try to justify your idleness by saying that your intelligence justifies it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) This option is not grammatically correct and its meaning is unclear.\nB) While grammatically correct, this implies an order not to use intelligence to find valid reasons for idleness, which is likely not the intended meaning.\nC) This option clearly expresses the intended meaning without ambiguity or grammatical issues.

If you have a high impedance (or use something like a 1K resistor) then you are essentially causing the frequency response of the headphones to go from hopefully flat to something not even close. \n\nThink of it like this... \n\nImpedance is basically a frequency\\-dependent resistance. Your headphones have an impedance that can change a lot depending on frequency. However, they are also designed so that (hopefully) the frequency response is mostly flat for a given voltage input, despite the wacky impedance graph.\n\nNow you put a 1K ohm resistor in series with the headphone. That resistor, plus the impedance of the headphone, form a voltage divider. But the dividing ratio changes over frequency because the impedance changes over frequency.

This is how it should be done:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage[absolute,overlay]{textpos}\n\\begin{document}\n  \\begin{textblock}{7}(7,7)                   %% adjust position\n        \\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{photo}\n\\end{textblock}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YhLkJ.jpg)\n\nAnother option will be to use `tikz` with `remember picture, and`overlay\\` options:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{calc}\n\\begin{document}\n  \\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]\n        \\node at ($(current page.north) +(0,-6in)$){\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{photo}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nHere you can use page location hooks so that job becomes easy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When adding a photo to a LaTeX document using the moderncv template, which of the following approaches is most appropriate and likely to work correctly?\n\nA) Use the wrapfigure environment to position the photo:\n```latex\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\\textwidth}\n    \\vspace*{-2.3cm}\n    \\hspace*{-2cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\adjustbox{cframe=color1}{\\includegraphics[scale=0.07]{photo}}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n```\n\nB) Use the textpos package with a figure environment:\n```latex\n\\begin{textblock}{7}(7,7)\n    \\begin{figure}\n        \\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{photo}\n    \\end{figure}\n\\end{textblock}\n```\n\nC) Use the textpos package without a figure environment:\n```latex\n\\begin{textblock}{7}(7,7)\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{photo}\n\\end{textblock}\n```\n\nD) Use the tikz package with remember picture and overlay options:\n```latex\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]\n    \\node at ($(current page.north) +(0,-6in)$){\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{photo}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach for adding a photo in this context. The wrapfigure environment (option A) is not suitable for the moderncv template as it demands too much for proper placement. Option B incorrectly uses a figure environment within textblock, which causes errors as figure is a float and shouldn't be used here. Option C correctly uses the textpos package to overlay the photo without a figure environment, which is the recommended approach in the documentation. While option D (using tikz) is also a valid approach, the textpos method in option C is simpler and directly addressed in the given context."}}
