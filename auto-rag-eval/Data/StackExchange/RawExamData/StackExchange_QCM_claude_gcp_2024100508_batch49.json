If a fiber over a closed point of $Y$ is reduced is the generic fiber reduced?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's impose a flatness hypothesis (whose necessity is explained in Jason Starr's answer). The answer is still negative, but to explain the context for the counterexample it is instructive to first record some necessary features of any counterexample, so we know where to look.\n\nIn view of my above comment about geometric fibers, any search for a counterexample will necessarily have to involve a special fiber that is reduced yet not geometrically reduced. In other words, any counterexample will have to involve an imperfect residue field at the special point in the base. \n\nMoreover, the answer is affirmative if the base $Y$ is Dedekind. Indeed, we can assume in such a case that the base $Y$ is Spec($R$) for a dvr $R$ with uniformizer $t$, so $X$ is a proper flat $R$\\-scheme having reduced special fiber $X\\_0$. If $N$ is the coherent sheaf of nilpotents inside $O\\_X$ then for any section $f \\\\in N(U)$ over an open $U \\\\subset X$ we know that $f\\_0 \\= f\\|\\_{U\\_0}$ vanishes since $X\\_0$ is reduced, so $f$ is a section of $tO\\_X$. In other words, $N \\\\subset tO\\_X$. By $R$\\-flatness of $X$, it is clear (check!) that $N \\\\cap tO\\_X \\= tN$, so $N \\\\subset tN$. Hence, by Nakayama's Lemma along points of the special fiber, it follows that $N$ has vanishing stalks along the special fiber $X\\_0 \\\\subset X$. The closed support of the coherent $N$ inside the $R$\\-proper $X$ is therefore disjoint from the special fiber. But every non\\-empty closed set in $X$ must meet $X\\_0$ due to $R$\\-properness of $X$ and locality of $R$. Thus, the support is empty, which is to say $N \\= 0$. Then $X$ is reduced, so its localization given by the generic fiber over the integral base $Y$ is also reduced. That settles the question affirmatively when $Y$ is Dedekind (and $X$ is any proper flat $Y$\\-scheme).\n\nIn view of the preceding observations, an \"optimal\" counterexample should involve a local base $Y \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(R)$ where $R$ is a non\\-Dedekind 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain having imperfect residue field with characteristic $p \\> 0$. And in fact there *are* counterexamples over such $R$, as we now construct. This shows that the EGA result with reducedness for *geometric* fibers is essentially \"best possible\". We will give counterexamples in equicharacteristic $p$. Maybe someone else can address the story with generic characteristic 0\\. (**SEE THE END FOR SUCH AN EXAMPLE**)\n\nThe idea is to make such an $R$ that is an order in a dvr of characteristic $p$ whose fraction field contains a certain $p$th root but for which $R$ does not contain that $p$th root. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p \\> 0$ and let $A \\= k(t)\\[x]\\_{(x)}$, a dvr with uniformizer $x$ and residue field $k(t)$ that is obviously not perfect. Let $F \\= {\\\\rm{Frac}}(A) \\= k(t,x)$ and let $A' \\= A\\[T]/(T^p \\- t) \\= k(T)\\[x]\\_{(x)}$, so the dvr $A'$ with uniformizer $x$ is the integral closure of $A$ in $F' \\= F\\[T]/(T^p \\- t) \\= F(t^{1/p})$. Note that $A \\\\rightarrow A'$ is an example of a finite extension of discrete valuation ring whose ramification degree is 1 but residual extension is not separable (so it is not \"unramified\").\n\nThe residue field of $A'$ is $k(T)$ in which the element $t$ from the residue field of $A$ has image $T^p$ that *is* a $p$th power, but we can \"fix\" that (or rather, \"ruin\" it) by considering the order\n$R \\= A \\+ xA'$. Concretely, $R$ is the preimage of $k(t)$ under the reduction map $A' \\\\twoheadrightarrow k(T)$.\n\nClearly $R$ is a 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain whose fraction field is $F'$, residue field is $k(t)$, and normalization is $A'$. Note that the element $T \\= t^{1/p}$ in the fraction field $F'$ of $R$ does *not* lie in $R$. \n\nInside $\\\\mathbf{P}^2\\_A$ with homogeneous coordinates $\\[U,V,W]$, consider the closed subscheme $Z$ defined by $U^p \\+ t V^p$. This is $A$\\-flat since $A$ is Dedekind. Its special and generic fibers are the \"same\" projective scheme over the residue field $k(t)$ and fraction field $k(t,x)$ respectively, and as such these fibers are both *reduced* (as $t$ is not a $p$th power in either the residue field or fraction field of $A$, each of characteristic $p$) and are also both geometrically irreducible. The base change\n$X \\= Z\\_R$ is certainly $R$\\-flat (since $Z$ is $A$\\-flat) and projective with special fiber that is the *same* as that of $Z$ since $R$ and $A$ have the same residue field by design. In particular, $X\\_0$ is reduced (though not geometrically so!). The generic fiber $X\\_{F'} \\= Z\\_{F'}$ is non\\-reduced since $t$ is a $p$th power in $F'$. Note however that the $R$\\-flat $X$ has irreducible generic fiber, so $X$ is also irreducible. Voila.\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**:\nHere is an even better example in the same spirit, but with a twist on the idea so that it works in generic characteristic 0\\. It will use an order in \n$\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[T]\\_{(p)}$ as I had been hoping. This example was pointed out to me by somebody \"offline\". \n\nLet $A \\= \\\\mathbf{Z}\\[t]\\_{(p)}$, a dvr with uniformizer $p$, residue field $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$, and fraction field $F \\= \\\\mathbf{Q}(t)$. Let $A'\\= \\\\mathbf{Z}\\[T]\\_{(p)}$ made into an $A$\\-algebra via $t \\\\mapsto T^p$, so its fraction field $F'$ is $F(t^{1/p})$.\nLet $R \\= A \\+ pA'$, a 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain with residue field $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$ and fraction field $F'$.\n\nConsider the polynomial $f(U,V) \\= (U \\+ T V)^p \\\\in U^p \\+ t V^p \\+ pA'\\[U,V]\n\\\\subset R\\[U,V]$.\nObviously $f$ is a $p$th power over $F' \\= \\\\mathbf{Q}(T)$, but it is *not* a (unit multiple of a) $p$th power over $R$ since the reduction of $f$ over the residue field of $R$ is $U^p \\+ t V^p \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)\\[U,V]$, which is even irreducible. \n\nLet $X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{P}^1\\_R$ be defined by the vanishing of the homogeneous $f$. \n(The equicharacteristic\\-$p$ example above ought to have been considered inside $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$ just as well; I mistakenly thought being in $\\\\mathbf{P}^2$ would provide better irreducibility properties, but those hold already with $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$.) \nThe $R$\\-scheme is $R$\\-flat because each of $U^p$ and $V^p$ have coefficients that are units in $R$ (ensuring that after dehomogenization, the coordinate ring of the affine open chart of $X$ is a finite free $R$\\-module). In fact, we see that $X$ is finite flat over $R$, with degree $p$.\n\nThe special fiber of $X$ is the zero scheme of $U^p \\+ t V^p$ in $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$ over $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$, and this is visibly reduced. On the other hand, the generic fiber is $(U\\+TV)^p\\=0$ in $\\\\mathbf{P}^1\\_{F'}$, and this is visibly not reduced (but is irreducible, and likewise $X$ is irreducible; in fact, $X\\_{\\\\rm{red}} \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(R)$!)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let f : X \u2192 Y be a projective morphism between irreducible Noetherian schemes, where Y = Spec(R) and R is a 1-dimensional local Noetherian domain.

'*.R'`, but it doesn't return any results. What modification should be made to correctly use this function for finding R scripts?\n\nA) Change the function call to `ff . 'R$'`\nB) Modify the function to use `grep -E` instead of `grep -i`\nC) Call the function with `ff . '**.R'`\nD) Add quotes around $1/* in the function definition\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The issue lies in how grep interprets the wildcard character (*) in basic regular expressions. By default, grep uses basic regular expressions, where a single asterisk doesn't have the same meaning as in shell globbing. \n\nUsing '**.R' instead of '*.R' provides a pattern that grep can interpret correctly in this context. The double asterisk (**) is often used in zsh for recursive matching, and in this case, it helps grep to match the desired R script files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 'R$' would only match files ending exactly with 'R', potentially missing files like 'script.R'.\nOption B wouldn't solve the core issue of pattern matching.\nOption D is unrelated to the pattern matching problem and wouldn't resolve the issue."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/07", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/30907", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/5101/"], "docs_id": 30907, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One way to define toric varieties is as quotients of affine $n\\-$space by the action of some torus.

Let $\\\\mathbb{G}\\_m$ act on $\\\\mathbb{A}^n$ in the obvious way. Then the quotient of $\\\\mathbb{A}^n$ by this action is a single point, as \"everything is rescaled to the origin\". More rigously the only functions invariant under this action are the constants, thus the quotient is the spectrum of the ground field.

Usually callbacks are handled in a continuation style, so the callback will be executed in the thread of the consumer, not producer.\n\n**thread, blocking based programming:** using classic OS threads and mutexes and semaphores. Waiting is handled by blocking the calling thread. Although not usually used, in my perspective this requires *cooperative threads* to be effective.\n\nThe status quo from my POV\n--------------------------\n\nIt seems like more and more people turn away from the classic way of using syncrhonization/cooperation primitives for threading and from blocking (as in making current thread sleep) in general. Their problems seems to be mainly based on the following (italics are my thoughts on the matter):\n\n* Blocking synchronization is prone to deadlocks (*async code can livelock too*)\n* Too many threads cause oversubscription and OS scheduler makes latency sky high (*fixable?*)\n* Whatever libraries that use threading do not provide any way of cooperation, thus causing the problem above\n* High cost of a thread spin\\-up (*perceived?*)\n* Not usable if sleep/wakeup is noticeable compared to active time (*true*)\n\n\\#5 is not fixable without patching kernel and \\#3 could be fixed by better teaching.\n\nThe can of worms\n----------------\n\nAsync systems usually rely on events that trigger something else, thus cascading. Even if the above problems were fixed by async event based programming, it creates harder issues that are solvable by blocking thread based programming:\n\n* Starvation (very hard to achieve fairness without OS support, which in turn utilizes hardware clocks to enforce CPU time slices)\n* Can break when only one worker is allocated (this is mostly true of lock free queues, nothing can cause progress condition when the worker is not giving CPU time to another task, although this is solved with coroutines)\n* Exclusivity and ABA problems (with OS threads no thread can be scheduled on multiple CPUs at the same time, while with event based programming some event might be fired more than needed)\n* Complexity either goes into the library (which, if written with poor interface, pretty much doubles the mental complexity) or into the user code\n\nWhy reinvent the wheel?\n-----------------------\n\nFor most complaints I have seen with thread based blocking programming, I couldn't find any reason why it couldn't be solved with classic approach. The only problem is when a thread needs to run for so small amount of time that typical \\~10 microsecond delay will start becoming noticable. It is usually I/O bound applications. On all other cases I found that non\\-blocking code is usually less efficient on the normal path (non contending), because it does more operations to ensure atomicity. It seems like almost all problems could be solved by using blocking in a better way (don't hold lock for more than very few operations) and exposing parallelism instead of just spawning threads (algorithms could use task queues, for example). Real\\-time is not possible without preemption, so async event driven code is not real\\-time by definition. Even the coroutine based frameworks pretty much duplicate the OS scheduler and synchronization primitives.\n\nExamples when threads are superior\n----------------------------------\n\nOn one occasion I had to utilize only 2 CPU cores for a stream of tasks, where some tasks take about 100 times longer than the others. Having two of those would pretty much stop anything from making progress. I did the following:\n\n1. Allocate two threads for lightweight tasks and make the producers put lightweight tasks into a queue\n2. Spin up a thread for every heavy task\n3. Put everything under `SCHED_RR` with a timeslice set to upperbound of a lightweight task, so that even in case of heavier tasks, lighter ones could make progress\n\nFor async event based programming, this would require support from the callee, and it would have predefined amount of preemption points, while OS based one is a pretty much coroutine with as many preemption points as possible, albeit with less control over where exactly it will be preempted.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\nSince async event driven programming offers so little benefits, why is there shift towards it? What am I missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"async\" approach better facilitates human reasoning.\n========================================================\n\nWhen most people drive, they don't need to concern themselves with how every element of the car is interacting. Forget the tires \\- when you turn the steering wheel, the car turns. Sure, there are exceptional cases where you need to remember that the tires exist, and you need to keep the big picture in your head to avoid big errors. But for the most part, that's background knowledge that won't help you get to the store and back.\n\nTechnology grows to cover the pain points\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn computing as a whole, things tend to move from \"easy for the machine\" to \"easy for the person\". User\\-friendliness (noting that developers are the users of programming technologies) is obviously valuable, so as technology and discipline develop, patterns tend toward the human.\n\nIn programming languages, for example, we've generally moved from \"low\" to \"high\"; machine to assembly to `C` to `C++` to `C#`, for example (not that each is specifically an iteration of its predecessor, but as a general direction). Early languages tended to be more dynamic, because it's easy to interpret a dynamic language, whereas many modern languages tend to come with more compile\\-time checks and pre\\-processing. Obviously dynamic and low\\-level languages are still valuable \\- especially in specific situations \\- but the benefits of things like generic types, garbage collection, and syntactic sugar are undeniable for most software development.\n\nSeparate the model from the mechanism\n-------------------------------------\n\nAlso look at cloud computing \\- have you heard the buzzword \"serverless\"? Obviously there's still a server, but the details of its hardware can be safely ignored in most situations. With architectural patterns like microservices, there's more and more push toward completely isolating different areas of an application domain; each piece is maintained as a black box and coordination is only required at the edges. This is supported and enforced by cloud resources like Azure Functions or AWS Lambda that may not run anywhere near one\\-another in time and space. Coordinating all of these pieces turns out to be *a distraction* from software design and development rather than a fundamental building block.\n\nThis extends naturally to concurrent programming. It's easier to think \"pick up here when data is available\" than it is to think about scheduling whose turn it is and ensuring that timing works out. Software design principles suggest focusing on a single responsibility, and part of that is keeping the details coordination out of a given chain of events.\n\nFeatures like `async` and `await` or promise `then` callbacks build upon low\\-level thread coordination the way loops build on `goto`. They behave in a structured, consistent way that is more limited and with somewhat more overhead, but are ultimately more predictable and quick to use in typical scenarios. When I write `getValue().then(useValue)`, I can assume that code will execute in that order as time progresses, albeit with a time disconnect.

It allows developers to focus on the logical sequence of operations without getting bogged down in the details of thread management and coordination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage mentions that async code can still suffer from livelocks, and it doesn't completely eliminate synchronization issues.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage suggests that the cost of thread spin-up might be more perceived than real, and async programming isn't necessarily more efficient for all types of applications.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that \"Real-time is not possible without preemption, so async event driven code is not real-time by definition.\"\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to understand the core argument of the passage and differentiate it from other claims that might seem plausible but are not supported by the given information."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/27", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/63608178", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/11254964/"], "docs_id": 63608178, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to see if there is any way to implement a counter or some solution that will make the page refresh only once upon the 404 event.\n\nIn line 90 of the code that I will share with you at the end I have the problem since a loop is formed with the 404 error and the page is refreshed indefinitely.\n\nLine 90:\n\n`} else if (this.status === 404) { location.reload(); console.log(\"Error 404\")}`\n\nComplete code:\n\n```\nthis.refreshCover = function (songIt = '', artistIt) {\n        // Default cover art\n        var urlCoverArt = DEFAULT_COVER_ART;\n\n        // URL of proxy for lyrics Api CORS Allow Origin *\n        var proxy_URL = PROXYURL;\n\n        var itunes_api = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n\n        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhttp.onreadystatechange = function () {\n            var coverArt = document.getElementById('currentCoverArt');\n            var coverBackground = document.getElementById('bgCover');\n            var backgroundDefault = 'img/background.jpg';\n\n            // Get cover art URL on iTunes API\n            if (this.readyState === 4) { \n\n                if (this.status === 200) {\n                var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);\n\n                var artworkUrl100 = (data.resultCount) ?

In this case, the array 'a' is filled with values from 0 to 23, with one NaN value at position (2,1). The maximum value is 23, which is at index 22 when the array is flattened.\n\nC) Incorrect. This would be the result if nanargmax() returned a tuple of indices for the maximum value in a 2D array, but it actually returns a flat index.\n\nD) Incorrect. nanargmax() is specifically designed to handle arrays with NaN values, so it won't raise a ValueError in this case.\n\nThe key points to remember are:\n1. nanargmax() ignores NaN values\n2.

It uses the $block->getImageUrl() method, which is specifically designed to retrieve product images in Magento 2 order views.\nD) While $block->getProduct() might work to get the product, using getSmallImage() directly is not the recommended way to retrieve a formatted image URL in Magento 2.\n\nThe key takeaway is that Magento 2 has different methods for handling product images in order views compared to Magento 1, and developers should avoid using Mage:: class methods in Magento 2 projects."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/08/19", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/128087", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/3454/"], "docs_id": 128087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In *Animal Crossing: New Leaf*, is there a way to gain a particular villager?\n\nFor example, if I want Benjamin to join my town, how do I increase the chance of that villager moving in?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No**, nothing like this is in the game.\n\nIf you have a certain villager, no restriction will be placed on your friends (which of course is true the other way around, too).

This $\\\\theta$ could be population mean for example. Usually you can't get all the data from the population. So you draw a sample $X$ of size $N$ from the population. Let's assume you have i.i.d. sample for simplicity. Then you obtain your estimator $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\=g(X)$. You want to use $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ to make inferences about $\\\\theta$, so you would like to know the variability of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. \n\nFirst, there is a *true* sampling distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Conceptually, you could draw many samples (each of them has size $N$) from the population. Each time you will have a realization of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\=g(X)$ since each time you will have a different sample. Then in the end, you will be able to recover the *true* distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Ok, this at least is the conceptual benchmark for estimation of the distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Let me restate it: the ultimate goal is to use various method to estimate or approximate the *true* distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$.\n\nNow, here comes the question. Usually, you only have one sample $X$ that contains $N$ data points. Then you resample from this sample many times, and you will come up with a bootstrap distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. My question is: how close is this bootstrap distribution to the *true* sampling distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$? Is there a way to quantify it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bootstrap is based on the convergence of the empirical cdf to the true cdf, that is,\n$$\\\\hat{F}\\_n(x) \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n\\\\mathbb{I}\\_{X\\_i\\\\le x}\\\\qquad X\\_i\\\\stackrel{\\\\text{iid}}{\\\\sim}F(x)$$ converges ***(as $n$ goes to infinity)*** to $F(x)$ for every $x$. Hence convergence of the bootstrap distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}(X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n)\\=g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$ is driven by this convergence which occurs at a rate $\\\\sqrt{n}$ for *each* $x$, since $$\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\{\\\\hat{F}\\_n(x)\\-F(x)\\\\}\\\\stackrel{\\\\text{dist}}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\mathsf{N}(0,F(x)\\[1\\-F(x)])$$ even though this rate and limiting distribution does not automatically transfer to $g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$. In practice, to assess the variability of the approximation, you can produce a bootstrap evaluation of the distribution of $g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$ by double\\-bootstrap, i.e., by bootstrapping bootstrap evaluations.\n\n***As an update,*** here is an illustration I use in class:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0V4Y.jpg)\nwhere the lhs compares the true cdf $F$ with the empirical cdf $\\\\hat{F}\\_n$ for $n\\=100$ observations and the rhs plots $250$ replicas of the lhs, for 250 different samples, in order to measure the variability of the cdf approximation. In the example I know the truth and hence I can simulate from the truth to evaluate the variability. In a realistic situation, I do not know $F$ and hence I have to start from $\\\\hat{F}\\_n$ instead to produce a similar graph.\n\n***Further update:*** Here is what the tube picture looks like when starting from the empirical cdf:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GOyN.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the bootstrap method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic \u03b8\u0302.

The bootstrap method's effectiveness is based on the convergence of the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) to the true CDF as the sample size increases. This convergence occurs at a rate of \u221an for each point x in the CDF. However, this rate of convergence doesn't automatically transfer to all statistics \u03b8\u0302 = g(F\u0302n) derived from the empirical CDF. The convergence rate and limiting distribution can vary depending on the specific statistic and the function g(). \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the empirical CDF converges at a rate of \u221an, this rate doesn't necessarily apply to all statistics derived from it.\n\nAnswer C is too restrictive. The bootstrap can be effective for many types of statistics, not just simple ones like the mean.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the convergence rate is not always faster than \u221an and can vary depending on the statistic.\n\nThe key point is that while the bootstrap is based on a fundamental convergence property, its performance can vary for different statistics, and additional techniques (like double-bootstrap) may be needed to assess its accuracy in specific cases."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/16", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16577763", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1642385/"], "docs_id": 16577763, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using Java 1\\.7, and Hibernate 4\\.1\\.9\\.

One as transmitter and the other as receiver. In order to do that, I combined each with a MCP2551 transceiver. As long as the CAN operating Mode was set to LOOPBACK everything seemed to be good: The controller were able to send CAN messages, receive them(their own), and send it via UART to my PC (worked well). As next step I wanted to let them communicate with eachother. I set the operating mode of them to NORMAL. While the transmitter was sending the same messages as in Loopback Mode, and the Receiver was sending nothing (just waiting for any messages to come in), nothing happened. A measurement showed constant 2,5V at the transceivers output (Recessive State), and constant 3,3V at the STM32 TX (PA12\\). Anyone an idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> One as transmitter and the other as receiver\n\nIt doesn't work that way. CAN is a peer to peer network. Any node can send a message at any time, and all the other nodes on the network receive the message.\n\n> constant 3,3V at the STM32 TX\n\nThis is clearly a firmware bug. The signal isn't getting to the CAN bus transceiver chip, let alone the CAN bus itself.\n\nThings to be aware of:\n\n- The CAN lines need to be pulled together by about 60 \u03a9. That should be 120 \u03a9 at each end of the bus. If the bus is really short, like a few inches on a single PC board, then a single 60 \u03a9 resistor can be acceptable.\n\nOn a real bus, this terminates the line to avoid reflections. However, this \"termination\" is still required even when the whole system is lumped. The resistance functions as a pull\\-together to keep the bus in the recessive state when not explicitly driven to the dominant state. This termination is not optional, even when it has nothing to do with terminating the transmission line.\n\n- You need at least two functioning nodes to have a working CAN bus. This is because the transmitter of a message expects to see the ACK bit asserted. With nothing but the transmitter on the bus, nothing will assert ACK, and the transmitter will think the message was corrupted and resend it. But see point 3\\.\n\n- The CAN standard attempts to prevent broken nodes from taking down the whole bus. If a node sees too many error conditions, it will shut itself down for a while. If you have only one node that never sees ACK, some of this error logic might get tripped after a while. I don't remember off the top of my head what conditions cause what level of disabling, but not having a full bus could cause the single node to disable itself, at least somewhat."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When setting up CAN communication between two STM32 microcontrollers, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) CAN communication requires one device to be set as a transmitter and the other as a receiver.\n\nB) A constant 3.3V on the STM32 TX pin indicates proper signal transmission to the CAN bus.\n\nC) CAN bus termination is optional when the entire system is on a single PCB.\n\nD) CAN is a peer-to-peer network where any node can send a message at any time, and all other nodes on the network receive the message.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. CAN (Controller Area Network) is designed as a peer-to-peer network where any node can transmit or receive messages at any time.

It uses grep to find the device line and the line immediately following it, then checks for a pattern of all \"U\"s (up devices) between brackets, indicating that all devices are up and the rebuild is complete.

In this case, one obvious possibility that I can see (especially as you don't securely clear the $password or $estring variables in the code you have shown) is that the contents of those might be written out to swap space. That would mean that they are committed to permanent storage at least for a while even not in the presence of an active attacker. This can be largely mitigated by either disabling swap entirely, or running swap encrypted with a random encryption key, which makes the swap inaccessible after a reboot (because the decryption key needed to make sense of it is lost when the system RAM is cleared).\n\nI would *imagine* that 7zip is well\\-behaved enough to clear out the password from its command line quickly and then further from its internal variables as soon as it is no longer needed, but things like expanded key schedules might be kept for a longer period of time thus increasing the potential for them being swapped out. Those won't necessarily allow recovery of the password, but they may very well allow recovery of the plaintext from the encrypted archive. A simple `ps axw` issued at just the right moment will show someone who is logged in the password in plain text from the command line, but it isn't *stored* and the window of opportunity is small.\n\nWhen you send the e\\-mail, I presume that it contains the password in clear text form (or something that is easily derived into the corresponding plaintext, such as a Base64 encoded message body). **That e\\-mail almost certainly *will* be temporarily written to the system's mail queue**, which means that the password does end up on disk (unless you have the mail queue directory on a RAM disk, which besides the fact that the mail queue is supposed to be on persistent storage presents its own set of problems operationally). Especially if you are running a smarthost setup the queue file will likely be deleted very soon afterwards, but since it has been written to disk, \"the damage is done\" so to speak. Something like `strings /dev/sd?` on any server the mail passes through will probably recover the password to anyone who knows what to look for unless you take specific steps to mitigate this threat.\n\nOf course, e\\-mail in the first place isn't designed to be completely secure. The only way to have reasonable confidentiality assurances with e\\-mail over SMTP (even if you are using SMTP over SSL, or STARTTLS, *throughout the entire chain* of mail servers) is end\\-to\\-end encryption like S/MIME or OpenPGP.\n\n**TL;DR:** Your web application *probably* doesn't deliberately store anywhere the command including the password, or the password itself, but other components it relies on very well might during the course of normal operations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a PHP web application, a randomly generated password is used to encrypt files and then emailed to a user.

The thing about the T\\-shirt effect sizes is that, despite their widespread use, there's nothing to recommend them beyond \"Cohen said so\". (Meanwhile, Cohen said a lot of other, more important things about data analysis, but these have been largely ignored, probably because they would require taking data analysis more seriously.) A $d$ of .2 could be small in one context and large in another, which is unavoidable considering that $d$ is standardized and hence throws away the original units.\n\nIn general, if you're confronted with an effect and want to know how big it is in an intuitive sense, you should compare it to a plot of the data it came from, rather than standardizing it and looking for T\\-shirt sizes for the standardized form."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the current understanding of effect size interpretations like Cohen's d?\n\nA) Effect size interpretations are universal and can be applied consistently across all research contexts.\n\nB) Cohen's effect size interpretations (small ~0.20, medium ~0.50, large ~0.80) are the gold standard and should always be used.\n\nC) Effect size interpretations should be tailored to the specific context of the research and compared to visualizations of the data.\n\nD) Cliff's delta and Cramer's V have well-established, universally accepted effect size interpretations similar to Cohen's d.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer C is correct because the documentation emphasizes that effect size interpretations like Cohen's \"T-shirt sizes\" are arbitrary and not universally applicable.

It seems to be a general view that resistance has to be constant for Ohm's Law to be obeyed, but I don't understand why this is and how this is implied from the equation. Why can't the equation just be said to link three *variables*?\n\nHere are my thoughts: this equation is, in some ways, analogous to $s\\=vt$ (where $s$ is distance, $v$ is velocity and $t$ is time). We may need to use calculus to find $v$ if it is not constant, just as we may need to use calculus to find $R$ if it is not constant. (I understand that $\\\\frac {dV}{dI}$ is known as dynamic resistance, but do not understand why we can't just call it resistance). The difference I see with $s\\=vt$ is that distance cannot be seen as an instantaneous property, so we cannot say that $s\\=vt$ always applies. However, it seems to me that voltage and current are instantaneous properties, so at any instant in time why can we not say that $V\\=IR$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The equation:\n$$\\\\frac{dV}{dI} \\= R$$\nis a definition of $R$. Ohm's law is the statement that $R$ is constant over all voltages and currents (with $I \\= 0$ when $V \\= 0$), thereby giving:\n$$V \\= IR$$\n\nWith this definition, it is all but impossible to say $V \\= IR$ for any electrical component other than Ohmic resistors. Consider the Shockley equation: $$I \\= I\\_0(e^{aV}\\-1\\)$$ which describes an ideal diode. We have $$R \\= \\\\frac{dV}{dI} \\= \\\\frac{1}{aI} \\\\ne \\\\frac{V}{I}$$\n\nYou can, of course, go ahead and define $R' \\= \\\\frac{V}{I}$ as your resistance. However, the major advantage of the original definition, small\\-signal analysis (i.e. that small changes in voltages or currents may be treated as if a circuit is linear and approximately obeys Ohm's law for these changes) is lost when using $R'$.\n\nFor example, going back to the diode, if we know that $I(V\\_1\\) \\= I\\_1$, and we want the change in current $\\\\Delta I\\_1$ for a small change in the applied voltage: $V\\_1 \\\\rightarrow V\\_1 \\+ \\\\Delta V\\_1$, we can approximately write:\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V\\_1}{\\\\Delta I\\_1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{dV}{dI}(V\\_1\\)$$\nor $$\\\\Delta I\\_1 \\\\approx aI\\_1\\\\Delta V\\_1 \\= R \\\\Delta V\\_1$$\n\nThis means that you can effectively treat the diode as a resistor of resistance $R \\= aI\\_1$ for all 'small signals' added to the circuit over a given 'operating point'. This greatly simplifies the analysis of complex networks with diodes. The quantity $R'$ is of little use in such cases."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit contains a non-linear component described by the equation I = I\u2080(e^(aV) - 1), where I is current, V is voltage, and I\u2080 and a are constants.

However, for small changes around an operating point, its behavior can be approximated as linear using the concept of dynamic resistance, defined as R = dV/dI. This allows for small-signal analysis, where the component can be treated as having a resistance of R = 1/(aI) for small variations around a given operating point. This approximation is useful for analyzing complex circuits with non-linear components, even though the component does not strictly follow Ohm's law across its entire operating range."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/30", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/503961", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/108771/"], "docs_id": 503961, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need some advice.\n\nWe have an e\\-commerce website hosted at HostGator. Yesterday I ordered a RapidSSL certificate and they auto\\-configured it for me which made <https://www.ourdomain.com> work fine. I thought everything was going well and continued over night to push the application live and work on some tests with the payment gateway.\n\nThis morning I found out that people were having issues accessing the site, although it worked fine for me. It appeared that adding the SSL certificate invalidated the DNS and it had to re\\-propagate. HostGator did mention that they would be giving us a dedicated IP address along with the certificate. \n\nUsing <http://www.startping.com> to try to ping the domain from various places around the world, I'm seeing that only half or so point to the correct IP. The rest are pointing to some random IP that we weren't even using in the first place.\n\n**TLDR:** I added an SSL certificate to our website and now the site is unavailable to several places around the world. Is this a DNS propagation issue or some other \"gotcha\" I'm not aware of?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is normal \\- they should have warned you though \\- and you should expect interruptions for at least the next day (if you're lucky; and the next month if you're unlucky). \n\nOlder versions of SSL require their own IP. SNI is a \"modern\" technology that lets multiple sites share an IP, in the same way that standard HTTP can share via Virtual Hosts. SNI has about 80% support however, and 20% is enough to guarantee that no major hosting site will support it. So when you implement SSL, you require your own IP address (you're probably paying more for this too).\n\nSince you're switching IP addresses, it will take time for anyone who has the old IP cached to grab the new IP. Your TTL is 4 hours, so anyone who hasn't visited your site in the last 4 hours *should* be working now. Some DNS servers don't play by the rules (and it's too hard to identify them to do anything about it \\- as much as I'd really like to) and will cache your entry as long as they'd like (which could mean malfunctioning patrons for some time to come).\n\nThis is all very common among the hosting industry, though my host gave a huge red warning about interruptions and stuff (they went out of their way to explain the issues, very likely they got tired of having to explain it to people who didn't know already). I'd like to be surprised that your hosting provider didn't, but in honest they're probably charging \\<$5 a month for basic hosting packages (SSL, Domain name, IP, etc all extra) and are betting they wont piss you off enough to make you leave."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An e-commerce website owner recently added an SSL certificate to their site hosted on HostGator.

You're not allowed to have more than one measure per predictor/level in a paired test for each subject. You have two levels, stamina0 and stamina\\+.

What is the most appropriate approach to analyze this data?\n\nA) Use a paired Wilcoxon test with NA values added to the pre-treatment data to match the length of post-treatment data\nB) Use an unpaired Wilcoxon test to compare the two conditions\nC) Aggregate the data to comparable paired measures (e.g., cookies/hour) for each subject before running a paired test\nD) Run the paired Wilcoxon test as is, allowing R to automatically fill in blank values with NA\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to aggregate the data to comparable paired measures for each subject before running a paired test. This is because:\n\n1. Paired tests require an equal number of observations in each group.\n2. Adding NA values or allowing R to fill in blanks could lead to incorrect results.\n3. Using an unpaired test would ignore the within-subject nature of the data.\n4. Aggregating to a common measure (like cookies/hour) allows for a fair comparison between the pre- and post-treatment conditions while maintaining the paired structure of the data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because artificially adding NA values can skew the results. Option B is inappropriate because it ignores the paired nature of the data. Option D is problematic because it relies on R's automatic handling of missing values, which may not accurately represent the experimental design."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/28", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/296345", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/88558/"], "docs_id": 296345, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to write lines including tokens to an external file and read them again in a different document.

If you want to have the \\-1th and 0th branch of the Lambert W function drawn in different colours; you'll need to plot them separately.

(Mobile devices are not supported.)\nThe PDF version uses `media9` for playing the embedded sound file [`click.mp3`](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/animate/files/click.mp3), taken from the `animate` package which already provides a ticking metronome example in its manual.\n\nThe standalone **SVG** version runs in most contemporary Web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera ...), even on mobile devices. Here, the sound is embedded as a Base64\\-encoded Blob using the HTML5 `<audio>` tag. (`click.mp3` was encoded with \"`base64 click.mp3`\" on the command line.) The physically embedded sound file makes the SVG self\\-contained.\n\nIn either case, playback of the sound is started by JavaScript on every frame change of the running animation. The \"timeline\" feature of `animate` is used to associate the JS code with each frame (timeline input `frames.txt`).\n\nThe tempo marker is implemented with a second `animateinline` environment. It provides 39 typical metronome speeds that can be stepped trough with the \\+/\\- buttons. The buttons make use of the `animate` JavaScript interface to increment and decrement the tempo marker frame number. Another timeline file, `tempo.txt`, associates each marker frame with a JS snippet that scales the metronome speed accordingly, again using the JS interface of `animate`.\n\n**PDF** version, to be compiled with `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, `latex+dvips+ps2pdf`, or

The electric field provides a constant force perpendicular to the initial velocity, resulting in a parabolic path similar to projectile motion under gravity.\nC) is incorrect.

It's not a practical solution for most users.\nD) A voltage regulator wouldn't effectively control the power consumption of the hot plate and could lead to inefficiencies or improper operation of the heating element.\n\nThe gas burner solution (B) addresses the core issue of energy efficiency in an off-grid situation without requiring complex electrical modifications or risking compatibility issues with the inverter."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/02/19", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/60294649", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/12923710/"], "docs_id": 60294649, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new in `flexbox`.

For desktop screens, it uses 'left main main right' to create a layout with sidebars on either side of a wider main content area. For mobile screens, it uses 'left main main' followed by 'right main main' on the next row, which places the left sidebar above the main content and the right sidebar below it.

Split the data before instantiating the Leaflet GeoJSON layers, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// Assuming that you've already fetched the data off the network\nvar data = {\n  roads: {\n    type: \"FeatureCollection\",\n    features: .....\n  },\n  pois: {\n    type: \"FeatureCollection\",\n    features: .....\n  },\n  .......\n};\n\nfor (var featureLayer in data) {\n    console.log(featureLayer); // e.g. \"roads\", \"pois\", etc\n    var geoJson = data[featureLayer]; // This is now a valid geojson object\n\n    // Now we can spawn Leaflet layers based on valid GeoJSON\n    var layer = L.geoJson(geoJson, {...}).addTo(map);\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using TileStache to combine multiple vector layers into a single Multi-Response GeoJSON tile, which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for rendering the data in Leaflet?\n\nA) Use the TileLayer.GeoJSON plugin directly with the Multi-Response GeoJSON tile URL\n\nB) Parse the Multi-Response GeoJSON on the client-side and create separate L.geoJson layers for each feature type\n\nC) Modify TileStache to output standard GeoJSON format instead of Multi-Response GeoJSON\n\nD) Use a custom Leaflet plugin specifically designed to handle Multi-Response GeoJSON tiles\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct approach is B. The Multi-Response GeoJSON format produced by TileStache is not standard GeoJSON and cannot be directly rendered by Leaflet or common GeoJSON plugins. The best solution is to parse the Multi-Response GeoJSON on the client-side, separating each feature type (e.g., roads, pois, etc.) into its own valid GeoJSON object. Then, create separate L.geoJson layers for each feature type and add them to the map.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the TileLayer.GeoJSON plugin expects standard GeoJSON, not the Multi-Response format.\n\nOption C could work but requires modifying the server-side code, which may not always be possible or desirable.\n\nOption D is hypothetical and not a readily available solution, making it less practical than client-side parsing."}}
