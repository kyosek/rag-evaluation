They've been closing in on us all\n>  night.\n\nIn colloquial English, the emphatic **damned** as it is used there in conjunction with the Olympics has very concentrated meaning. \n\nConsider this analogous example:\n\n> You were arguing with the professor in class today about the role of\n>  amino acids in biosynthesis. The guy **wrote the damned textbook** on the subject!\n\nIn the *Tears of the Sun* example we can discern the context: the speaker and his group are being chased by some others who are narrowing the gap between them. These others are \"closing in\" or catching up. They are outrunning the speaker and his group.\n\nThe Olympics in your example, and the textbook in the analogous example, serve as *paradigms* of excellence and achievement. Using the word **damned** as modifier emphasizes that fact, and in emphasizing it, the meaning that results is:\n\nYou, with your limited knowledge of biosynthesis, *are nothing* compared to him with his great knowledge of the subject.\n\nWe, with our limited running ability, *are nothing* compared to them with their great athletic abilities.\n\nP.S. In the original statement, \"to run\" means \"to control\", although there is some wordplay since athletic running is actually involved. We could change the verb **run** to **own** (They own the Olympics, meaning \"they dominate the competition\") and the meaning would remain much the same: they are in charge because they always excel in these competitions. \n\nP.P.S.

It uses the Olympics as a paradigm of athletic excellence to emphasize how formidable the pursuers are. The word \"damned\" serves as an emphatic modifier, stressing the speakers' frustration at being outmatched. This interpretation aligns with the context of the chase scene and the subsequent dialogue about the closing gap between the groups.

My question is the following: Wikipedia gives three assumptions that need to hold for the Wilcoxon signed rank test (slightly modified for my questions):\n\nLet Zi \\= Xi\\-Yi for i\\=1,...,n.\n\n1. The differences Zi are assumed to be independent.\n2. (a.) Each Zi comes from the same continuous population, and (b.) each Zi is symmetric about a common median;\n3. The values which Xi and Yi represent are ordered...so the comparisons 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to' are useful.\n\nThe documentation for ?wilcox.test in R, however, seem to indicate that (2\\.b) is actually something that is tested by the procedure:\n\n\"...if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a Wilcoxon signed rank test of the null that the distribution ... of x \\- y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed.\"\n\nThis sounds to me as though the test is performed for the null hypothesis that \"Z is distributed symetrically around median mu\\=SomeMu\" \\-\\- such that rejection fo the null could be *either* a rejection of the symmetry *or* a rejection that the mu around which Z is symmetric is SomeMu.\n\nIs this a correct understanding of the R documentation for wilcox.test? The reason this is important, of course, is that I am conducting a number of paired\\-difference tests on some before\\-and\\-after data (\"X\" and \"Y\" above). The \"before\" and \"after\" data individually are highly skewed, but the differences are not skewed nearly as much (although still skewed somewhat). By that I mean that the \"before\" or \"after\" data considered alone has skewness \\~7 to 21 (depending on the sample I am looking at), while the \"differences\" data has skewness \\~\\= 0\\.5 to 5\\. Still skewed, but not nearly as much. \n\nIf having skewness in my \"differences\" data will cause the Wilcoxon test to give me false/biased results (as the Wikipedia article seems to indicate), then skewness could be a big concern. If, however, the Wilcoxon tests are actually testing whether the differences distribution is \"symmetric around mu\\=SomeMu\" (as ?wilcox.test seems to indicate) then this is less of a concern.\n\nThus my questions are:\n\n1. Which interpretation above is correct? Is skewness in my \"differences\" distribution going to bias my Wilcoxon test?\n2. If skewness *is* a concern: \"How much skewness is a concern?\"\n3. If the Wilcoxon signed rank tests seem grossly inappropriate here, any suggestions for what I should use?\n\nThanks so much. If you have any further suggestions about how I might do this analysis I am more than happy to hear them (although I can also open another thread for that purpose). Also, this is my first question on Cross Validated; if you have suggestions/comments on how I asked this question, I am open to that as well!\n\n---\n\nA little background: I am analyzing a dataset that contains observations on what I'll call \"errors in firm production.\" I have an observation on errors occuring in the production process before and after a surprise inspection, and one of the goals of the analysis is to answer the question, \"does the inspection make a difference in the oberved number of errors?\"\n\nThe data set looks something like this:\n\n```\nID, errorsBefore, errorsAfter, size_large, size_medium, typeA, typeB, typeC, typeD\n0123,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0 \n2345,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0\n6789,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0\n1234,8,8,0,0,1,0,0,0\n\n```\n\nThere are roughly 4000 observations. The other variables are catagorical observations that descrie characteristics of the firms. Size can be small, medium, or large, and each firm is one and only one of those. Firms can be any or all of the \"types.\"\n\nI was asked to run some simple tests to see if there were statistically significant differences in observed error rates before and after the inspections for all firms and various sub\\-groupings (based on size and type). T\\-tests were out because the data was severely skewed both before and after, for example, in R the before data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore)\n# Min.  1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# 0.000  0.000    4.000  12.00    13.00  470.0\n\n```\n\n(These are made up \\-\\- I'm afraid I can't post the actual data or any actual manipulations of it due to proprietary/privacy issues \\-\\- my apologies!) \n\nThe paired differences were more centralized but still not very well fit by a normal distribution \\-\\- far too peaked. Differences data looked something like this:\n\n```\nsummary(errorsBefore-errorsAfter)\n# Min.   1st Qu.  Median   Mean  3rd Qu.    Max\n# -110.0  -2.000   0.000  0.005   2.000   140.0\n\n```\n\nIt was suggested that I use a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and after a brief persusal of ?wilcox.test and Wikipedia, and here, this seems like the test to use. Considering the assumptions above, I believe (1\\) is fine given the data generating process. Assumption (2\\.a) is not strictly true for my data, but the discussion here: [Alternative to the Wilcoxon test when the distribution isn't continuous?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4834/alternative-to-the-wilcoxon-test-when-the-distribution-isnt-continuous) seemed to indicate that this wasn't too much of a concern. Assumption (3\\) is fine. My only concern (I believe) is Assumption (2\\.b).\n\n**One additional note**, some years later: I eventually took an excellent non\\-parametric stats course and spent a lot of time on the rank\\-sum tests. Embedded in assumption (2\\.a), \"Each Zi comes from the same continuous population\", is the idea that both samples mush come from populations with *equal variance* \\-\\- this turns out to be *extremely* important, practically speaking. If you have concerns about differing variance in your populations (from which you draw the samples), you should be concerned about using WMW.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Wikipedia has misled you in stating \"...if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a Wilcoxon signed rank test of the null that the distribution ... of x \\- y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed.\"\n\nThe test determines whether the RANK\\-TRANSFORMED values of $z\\_i \\= x\\_i \\- y\\_i$ are symmetric around the median you specify in your null hypothesis (I assume you'd use zero). Skewness is not a problem, since the signed\\-rank test, like most nonparametric tests, is \"distribution free.\" The price you pay for these tests is often reduced power, but it looks like you have a large enough sample to overcome that.\n\nA \"what the hell\" alternative to the rank\\-sum test might be to try a simple transformation like $\\\\ln(x\\_i)$ and $\\\\ln(y\\_i)$ on the off chance that these measurements might roughly follow a lognormal distribution\\-\\-so the logged values should look \"bell curvish\". Then you could use a t test and convince yourself (and your boss who only took Business Stats) that the rank\\-sum test is working. If this works, there's a bonus: the t test on means for lognormal data is a comparison of medians for the original, untransformed, measurements.\n\nMe? I'd do both, and anything else I could cook up (likelihood ratio test on Poisson counts by firm size?). Hypothesis testing is all about determining whether evidence is convincing, and some folks take a heap of convincin'."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on paired before-and-after data.

It does not require the original data or the differences to be symmetrically distributed. The test is \"distribution-free,\" meaning it's not affected by the skewness of the original data.

This practice helps make questions more comprehensive and reduces the need for readers to sift through comments for important details.

This approach benefits both the post's author and future readers by creating a more complete and easily understood question or answer."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/07/07", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/533632", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/258239/"], "docs_id": 533632, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When using the method of moments to fit a symmetric mean zero distribution, does it make more sense to fit higher order moments or lower order absolute moments? I could not find any resources which discuss/compare the merits of these two approaches.\n\nMy intuition is that with fewer observations it would be preferable to fit the absolute lower order moments which will be a more stable estimation (just a guess). In practice (in industry not academia) I have seen both methods used (usually the method that is easier to solve analytically...).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Partial answer \\-\\-\\- for the reader to complete.*\n\nWe can simplify the question a bit by considering the relationship between the moments. Consider a random variable $X$ and $m\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(X^r)$ denote the $r$th raw moment and let $a\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(\\|X\\|^r)$ denote the $r$th absolute moment. For simplicity, we will assume that all the required moments exist. For a distribution that is symmetric around zero, we have:\n\n$$\\\\begin{matrix}\nm\\_r \\= 0 \\\\ \\\\ \\& \\& \\& \\\\text{for odd } k, \\\\ \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\nm\\_r \\= a\\_r \\& \\& \\& \\\\text{for even } k. \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{matrix}$$\n\nSo, essentially, the question becomes, should we fit using the lowest order absolute moments or only every second absolute moment (i.e., those with even order). The lower absolute moments are usually going to be more robust, and may have lower variance, but estimators on the lower order absolute moments are also often biased. There may be a trade\\-off between bias and variance in such cases, and you will need to derive the bias and variance of your estimators in the case under consideration to be sure.\n\nUltimately, the relative merits of two competing estimators is assessed by their statistical properties (e.g., bias, variance, MSE, consistency, other asymptotic properties). Usually this process entails looking at the moments of the estimator (or even its full distribution in some cases) in a class of problems under consideration and seeing how the estimator performs at different sample sizes under different parametric inputs. I am not aware of any specific literature comparing the two estimators here (though there may well be some), but it is possible to make a comparison using ordinary techniques for the assessment of estimators.\n\n---\n\n**Example:** Consider data $X\\_1,...,X\\_n \\\\sim \\\\text{N}(0, \\\\sigma^2\\)$ from a normal distribution with zero mean.

It uses a couple of the `stringstrings` package's string manipulation routines, including its horrendously time\\-expensive `\\addlcwords` to identify the words you'd prefer to typeset in lower case. The rest of the code hooks this into APA's sectioning commands (it's tedious but it does the trick). \n\nNote that although this should get you going, it isn't completely ready for prime time, mainly because the work will take some time which, if it weren't something you wanted to proceed with, would divert me from things I'm actually supposed to be doing `:)`. Nevertheless, if this were something you wanted to proceed with, you'll need to let `stringstrings` know that '\\-' (as in 'Knock\\-on') should be treated the same way as a space character (run the code below to see what I mean). That work would probably involve handing '\\-' to `stringstrings`'s `\\encodetoken` command and involve providing some extra buttressing code \\-\\- although I wouldn't be surprised if there were several ways to skin that particular cat.\n\nAnyway, although there's still some work remaining, I hope it takes you in the direction you set out to go. (NB, don't forget: `stringstrings`'s `\\addlcwords` seems to scale time\\-exponentially.

Here's why:\n\n1. It uses `libxml_use_internal_errors(true)` to enable user error handling, allowing for detailed error reporting.\n2. It employs a `RecursiveIteratorIterator` with `RecursiveDirectoryIterator`, which efficiently traverses all subdirectories.\n3. It checks for the XML file extension explicitly.\n4. It uses `simplexml_load_file()` to attempt loading each XML file.\n5. It captures and logs all LibXMLError objects using `libxml_get_errors()`, providing detailed error information.\n6. It clears errors after logging with `libxml_clear_errors()`, ensuring clean error handling for each file.\n\nWhile the other options attempt to solve the problem, they have limitations:\nA) Uses glob(), which may not work for deeply nested directories.\nC) Relies on shell execution, which may not be available or secure in all environments.\nD) Uses a recursive function which is less efficient than the iterator approach and doesn't provide detailed error information."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/16", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/63435818", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/14113827/"], "docs_id": 63435818, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had to make an account to post this, but I\u2019m making an `!addrole` command to my bot and I\u2019m having some troubles figuring out how to add the role to the member, it keeps giving me this error\n\n`TypeError: Cannot read property \u2018roles\u2019 of undefined` \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working on:\n\n```js\nif (!message.content.startswith(prefix) || message.author.client) return;\nconst arguments = message.content.slice(prefix.length).split(\u2018\u2018);\nconst command = arguments.shift().toLowerCase();\n\nif (command === \u2018addrole\u2019) {\n    const role = message.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === \u2018ROLE\u2019)\n    const userId = arguments[0].slice(2, 19) // users id from the message\n    const user = message.guild.members.cache.get(userId) // user itself \n    user.roles.add(role)\n}\n\n```\n\nBut it keeps giving me the error above, please help.\nAlso, excuse my capitalization and indexing, I just copied the code from my computer to my phone, my browser was a bit glitchy.\nYou can also dm on Ralphiboy22\\#7118\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This code ensures that the file adheres to the expected format, which is that every line that does not begin with 'address\\-family' must be preceded by a line that does and that a line that begins with 'address\\-family' must be eventually followed by a line that does not begin with 'address\\-family'.\n\n```\nprevious_line = None\nwith open('out_put.txt', 'r') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        if line.startswith('address-family'):\n            previous_line = line\n        else:\n            if not previous_line:\n                raise Exception('Unexpected file format')\n            print(previous_line, end='')\n            print(line, end='')\n            previous_line = None\nif previous_line is not None:\n    raise Exception('Unexpected file format')\n\n```\n\nPrints:\n\n```\naddress-family ipv4 vrf vrf2\n neighbor 10.244.120.202 route-map LOCAL_PREF in\naddress-family ipv4 vrf vrf3\n neighbor 10.249.34.129 route-map LOCAL_PREF in\naddress-family ipv4 vrf vrf6\n neighbor 10.242.120.202 route-map LOCAL_PREF in\naddress-family ipv4 vrf vrf9\n neighbor 10.246.88.2 route-map LOCAL_PREF in\n\n```"}, "answer": "Question: Which of the following best describes the purpose of the code snippet provided in the StackExchange answer?\n\nA) To add a role to a user in a Discord server\nB) To validate and reformat the contents of a configuration file\nC) To implement an address family routing protocol\nD) To create a new text file with modified content\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The code snippet is designed to read a file named 'out_put.txt' and validate its format.

Modern C++ programming encourages the use of smart pointers or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) techniques for managing resources like network sockets.

But why is log convexity important? How does it affect the Gamma function's applicability in other areas of mathematics?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, let me mention that log convexity of a function is implied by an analytic property, which appears to be more natural than log convexity itself. Namely, if $\\\\mu$ is a Borel measure on $\\[0,\\\\infty)$ such that the $r$th moment \n$$f(r)\\=\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}z^r d\\\\mu(z)$$\nis finite for all $r$ in the interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$, then $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$.\n\nLog convexity can be effectively used in derivation of various inequalities involving the gamma function (particularly, two\\-sided estimates of products of gamma functions). It is linked with the notion of [Schur convexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorization) which is itself used in many applications.\n\n**An appetizer.** Let $m\\=\\\\max x\\_i$, $s\\=\\\\sum x\\_i$, $x\\_i \\> 0$, $i \\= 1,\\\\dots,n$, then\n$$\\[\\\\Gamma(s/n)]^n\\\\leq\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{1}^{n}\\\\Gamma (x\\_i)\\\\leq \\\\left\\[\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{s\\-m}{n\\-1}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{n\\-1}\\\\Gamma(m).\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1\\)$$\n\n(1\\) is trivial, of course, when all $x\\_i$ and $s/n$ are integers, but in general the bounds do not hold without assuming log convexity.\n\n**Edit added: a sketch of the proof**. Let $f$ be a continuous positive function defined on an interval $I\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R$. One may show that the function $\\\\phi(x)\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^{n}f(x\\_i)$, $x\\\\in I^n$ is Schur\\-convex on $I^n$ if and only if $\\\\log f$ is convex on $I$. Thus the function \n$$\\\\phi(x)\\=\\\\prod\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^n \\\\Gamma(x\\_i),\\\\quad x\\_i\\>0,\\\\qquad \\\\quad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\quad (2\\)$$ \nis Schur\\-convex on $I^n\\=(0,\\\\infty)^n$.

I don't know exactly when it unit was installed, but it seems to be showing its age. I noticed an excessive amount of rust flakes and, now that the gas heater is flexing its muscles for the cold this season, some ash. I honestly don't know much about HVAC systems in general, so I took some pictures. Is the condition of my system any cause for concern?\n\n[![Rusty ledge](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/in2Hk.jpg)\n\nThis is where most of the rust would pile up.

It was a little difficult to get a good picture of these holes, so please excuse the poor camera work on my part. This is the left one. I'm not sure what the larger bits once were, but they don't look or feel like metal or rust.

My question is, should I be concerned about the excessive amount of rust accumulating through this system?

And yes, I do say it something similar to that. I hold back only enough to let them feel as if the decision is theirs. I also make valid statements about things should work, vs how it currently is working, even if I have to research that info first (like you are doing).\n\nIf your landlord is honest, and not a slumlord, you have a good chance to get at least some work done to it, if not replaced. Most furnaces are designed to last around 20 years, so it's a good chance it's been replaced sometime in those 34 years since the building was built. It may simply need a good cleaning and some basic maintenance.\n\nFurnaces usually smell of burnt rust and dust when they first come on for the season. If that odor continues past the first week of steady use, then it's not normal, in my experience.\n\nAgain, letting your landlord make the decision will make you sound like less of a jerk tenant (or worse) and more of a concerned person who knows what you/they're talking about. Just because you got your information of the Interwebs doesn't have to mean anything to them. ;\\-)\n\nSimply making them away of a situation before it becomes a problem will, eventually and hopefully, will get you on their good side.

This approach allows the landlord to assess the situation and make informed decisions about maintenance or replacement. It's the tenant's responsibility to report issues, but not to diagnose or repair them. Option A is an overreaction without evidence of immediate danger.

So fast they're often gone before I click the little flag notification. Comment flags are handled slow. Only mods can see them and they're quite low priority. Like chat flags they *can* be auto\\-handled if enough flags pile up...but that's not a common situation.\n\nSolution? **Show comment flags to 10k users** and allow them to be acted on more like chat flags; users can add a flag to valid flags to help bring bad comments to their doom, and users can mark flags invalid just like Chat flags. \"Other\" flags would still show up for moderator\\-only intervention, but Spam/Offensive/Chatty/Obsolete comments could easily be handled by the community...if only they could see them.\n\n**Show context** to allow users to see the Post that was commented on and all the other comments.

It seems like extra, unnecessary overhead when the point is to help clear out the ephemeral aspects of the sites. Just let the reviewer skip that particular comment and move on to the next in the queue.\n* Likewise, I don't think we need the gamification aspects like we have with the main review queues.

Each letter in the label is treated separately, resulting in individual backgrounds per letter. Switching to a fixed size type for the label background, as mentioned in the StackExchange answer, is the most effective solution.

The dynamics for $r$ can be analyzed separately from dynamics of $\\\\phi$: it is a linear monotonous mapping which has exactly one fixed point at $r\\=1$ and no other periodic or fixed points. So, if any periodic points of full mapping do exist, they must be contained in $r\\=1$. Let's see what happens when $r \\=1$: $(1, \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}) \\\\mapsto (1, \\\\tilde{\\\\phi} \\+ \\\\theta \\\\mod 2\\\\pi)$, so the set $r \\=1$ is an invariant set. Because of \nmonotonicity, it is possible to show that the image of any set $\\\\alpha \\< r \\< \n\\\\beta$ with $\\\\alpha \\< 1 \\< \\\\beta$ lies in the interior of itself. You can recognize that these properties are enough to call $r \\= 1$ an attractor in the common sense (see [the beginning of Scholarpedia article](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Attractor#Classical_Attracting_Sets:_Three_equivalent_definitions)). However, what happens exactly on the attractor? As we've already shown, the dynamics on this attractor is described by the mapping $\\\\tilde{\\\\phi} \\\\mapsto \\\\tilde{\\\\phi} \\+ \\\\theta \\\\mod 2\\\\pi$. This is known as an [irrational rotation of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_rotation), and for our choice of $\\\\theta$ ($\\\\theta$ and $2\\\\pi$ are rationally inconsummerate, i.e. $\\\\theta / \\\\pi \\\\not \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$) it has no periodic or fixed points."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the discrete dynamical system defined by:\n\n$\\overline{r} = 1 + \\alpha (r - 1)$\n$\\overline{\\phi} = \\phi + \\theta \\cdot \\frac{1+r^2}{2} \\mod 2\\pi$\n\nWhere $0 < \\alpha < 1$, $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$, and $\\frac{\\theta}{\\pi} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true about this system?\n\nA) The system has no attractors because it lacks fixed points and periodic orbits on the entire phase space.\n\nB) The set $r = 1$ is an attractor, but it contains fixed points and periodic orbits.\n\nC) The system has a fixed point attractor at $(r, \\phi) = (1, 0)$.\n\nD) The set $r = 1$ is an attractor that contains neither fixed points nor periodic orbits.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The set $r = 1$ is indeed an attractor for this system.

The input is read, parsed, and the contents are stored on a structure for later use.\n\nNow, in general you want to keep into account transformation of the data from the input, such as adding default values when not specified, or adding full path information to relative path specified in the input. There are two different strategies to achieve this.\n\nThe first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time. In practice, you put all the intelligence into the input parser, and your application has no logic to deal with unexpected circumstances, such as an unspecified value. You lose the information of what was specified and what wasn't, but you gain in black\\-boxing the details. Your \"running code\" needs that information in any case and in a proper form, and is not concerned if it's the default or a user\\-specified information.\n\nThe second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior. unspecified values are not filled (which may however be a problem in languages not supporting None) and data is stored verbatim from the file. The intelligence for recovery must now go into the \"running code\", which must check what was specified in the file, eventually fall back to a default, or modify the input properly before using it. \n\nI would like to know your opinion on these two approaches, and in particular which one you found the most frequently implemented. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is, of course, a false dichotomy. The real answer is not this simple.\n\nAlso the presence or absence of `None` or `Null` isn't interesting (or even relevant).\n\n> The first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time.\n\nIn the long run, this becomes a maintenance nightmare. \"black\\-boxing the details\" is a bad policy.\n\n> The second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior.\n\nThat's a very weird way to put it, but that's one small part of a good architecture.\n\n**None**. `None` or `Null` is what you can call a *domain independent null* \\-\\- a universal nothing value. Some languages (like C) lack a domain independent null. That doesn't mean anything, because you have at least two ways forward.\n\n1. Domain\\-specific null. Input values like zero\\-length fields, or `999-99-9999` for a Social Security Number and stuff like that are domain\\-specific null values. You may have this kind of thing.\n2. Flags. The embedded SQL folks decided that the best way to handle SQL NULL in languages which don't have a domain\\-independent NULL is to provide an array of flags as null indicators. Applications in C (or COBOL or even FORTRAN) would have to check the null indicator for the presence of a SQL NULL. The actual field could have any random junk in it if the indicator said it was really a NULL.\n\n**Transformation**. For information on this, read up on ETL (Extract Transform Load) processing.\n\nApplications that process files naturally form a pipeline.\n\n1. Input reading. This byte\\-to\\-character processing. The least you can do to read. If you have Unicode decoders, they go here. Nothing more.\n2. Some kind of lexical scanning \\-\\- the basis for syntax recognition. If it's a CSV file, this is the comma or tab recognition.\n3. Some kind of file object parsing. This creates Domain Objects based on the file representation. For CSV or tab\\-delimited files, it creates a list of row values. \n\nFor XML files, 1, 2 and 3 are combined into an XML parser.\n4. Some kind of application object parsing. For CSV files, this is where you'd transform a sequence of objects into something more usable by your application. \n\nFor JSON, YAML or files, this creates the objects. Often, 2, 3 and 4 are all done by the load operation.\n\nAt this point you have an object in your application domain. Processing from this point forward is independent of the initial input format. In the applications I support, all of the previous processing is a separate library that handles XLS, XLSX, CSV and a few other formats for the inputs.\n\nOnce you have a application domain object, you then have to apply your application's rules. This varies a lot, of course. But here's the strategy.\n\n1. Write down the \"outer\" processing loop. `for object in source(): process( object )`. Maybe it involves decision making. `for object in source(): if valid( object): process( object )`. Whatever the high\\-level, end\\-user, easy\\-to\\-understand summary is.\n2. Odds are good that none of the input objects are actually suitable for this kind of processing. You have things like cleansing, filtering, validation, derived data calculation, foreign\\-key reference lookups and the final stage of persistence (update/insert/delete) processing. This forms a natural pipeline. \n\nDefine this pipeline from \"back to the front\". \n\nWhat must be true of the objects so they can fit with your ideal outer loop? \n\nWrite down all the conditions that must be true. (cleaned this way and that way, filtered for this that and the other, calculations done for this and that, etc., etc.)\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for the persistence step?\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for that?\n\netc. \n\nUntil you've run out of \"last thing to be done to prepare\" and you're looking at the input objects and a pipeline of steps to prepare them for their final persistence.\n3. For each stage in the pipeline, design the simplest transformation function you can get away with to do just that operation on each input object, cleaning, filtering, validating, deriving data, doing lookups and finally doing whatever persistence thing must be done.\n\nEach of these stages will have to make use of the null indicators, BTW. \n\nSome of these will be generic and reusable. Some won't be. Don't think about reuse. Discover reuse after you've written the same code 3 or more times.\n\n**Object Updates**. There are at least two ways to handle the transformations.\n\n1. Update the objects as you go. This is classic \"OO\" design. Stateful objects.\n2. Create new objects from old objects. This is more of the functional programming design. Immutable objects. In some languages, this requires more memory management. On the other hand, if each object is immutable, the pipeline becomes simpler because each stage expects a specific data type and creates an object of a different specific data type."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing an application that processes input files and transforms data, which of the following approaches is most recommended according to the documentation?\n\nA) Perform all data transformations and apply default values during the initial file reading stage, creating a black-box parser.\n\nB) Use a one-to-one mapper for file reading, storing data verbatim, and handle all transformations in the main application code.\n\nC) Implement a pipeline approach, separating concerns such as input reading, parsing, and domain-specific transformations into distinct stages.\n\nD) Always use a domain-independent null value like None or Null to represent missing data, regardless of the programming language used.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation argues against the simple dichotomy of approaches A and B, describing them as potentially problematic.

I think it's been solved now, all thanks to hours of googling, testing and stubbornness.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, I've fixed the read only filesystem problem by upgrading my Kernel to 3\\.8\\.2 but then it caused problems with my wifi drivers (Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802\\.11b/g LP\\-PHY \\[14e4:4315] (rev 01\\)). I could not get the wifi working as it seemed to be the problem with the wl module.\n\nNevertheless, I've found this article ([http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless\\-bcm4312\\-with\\-the\\-3\\-4\\-and\\-3\\-5\\-kernel/](http://www.mindwerks.net/2012/06/wireless-bcm4312-with-the-3-4-and-3-5-kernel/)), which helped me fix the wifi problem. So I've decided to give kernel 3\\.8\\.2 one more try with the wifi fix and it worked.\n\nTo summarise:\nIf you have read only filesystem issues and nothing is working, check what version of kernel you are running `uname -a`. If its below 3\\.8\\.2 then upgrade to it by following these steps:\n\nThe simplest set of instructions I always used for kernel upgrade / downgrade are by ubuntuforums.org user by the name of lykwydchykyn (url modified by me for this post):\n\n> ```\n> Go here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n> \n> Download 3 (maybe 4) debs to a folder somewhere:\n> \n> linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_all.deb\n> linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n> linux-image-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n> linux-image-extra-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb   # if available\n> \n> Install the debs with whatever package manager front-end you use (is gdebi still around?), or use these commands:\n> \n> cd /path/to/folder/where/you/put/the/debs\n> sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n> \n> ```\n> \n> Source: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p\\=11391743\\#post11391743](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11391743#post11391743)\n\nIf you have wifi problems after upgrading the kernel. Then try these steps:\n\n> ```\n> Download the 32 or 64-bit version:\n> http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php\n> Download my patches: bc_wl_abiupdate.patch and switch_to.patch\n> Extract the sources:\n> cd ~/Downloads; mkdir -p wl; cd wl; tar xf ../hybrid-portsrc*.tar.gz\n> Patch and compile the sources:\n> patch -p0 src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c < ~/Downloads/switch_to.patch; patch -p0 src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c < ~/Downloads/bc_wl_abiupdate.patch;\n> make; sudo make install; sudo depmod; sudo modprobe wl \n> \n> ```\n> \n> Give Ubuntu a few seconds after loading the \u201cwl\u201d kernel module, then\n>  eventually the Network Manager will start looking for wireless\n>  networks.\n\nThat's it, should work.\n\nGood luck to all of you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing random system problems with their Dell Inspiron 1545 running Linux. The system frequently requires a restart and file system checks on boot. After upgrading the kernel to version 3.8.2, the read-only filesystem issue was resolved, but WiFi stopped working. What series of steps should the user take to fully resolve both the filesystem and WiFi issues?\n\nA) Downgrade the kernel to version 3.5.0, modify the fstab file, and reinstall the operating system.\n\nB) Upgrade the kernel to version 3.8.2, then download and patch the Broadcom WiFi drivers, compile them, and load the new module.\n\nC) Replace the SSD drive, perform a clean install of the latest Ubuntu version, and use the default kernel provided.\n\nD) Modify the fstab file to include \"errors=remount-ro\" option for all partitions, then update the WiFi drivers through the package manager.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach involves two main steps:\n\n1. Upgrading the kernel to version 3.8.2 resolves the read-only filesystem issue. This can be done by downloading the appropriate .deb files from the Ubuntu kernel PPA and installing them using dpkg.\n\n2. After the kernel upgrade, the WiFi issues can be resolved by downloading the Broadcom drivers, applying the necessary patches (bc_wl_abiupdate.patch and switch_to.patch), compiling the sources, and loading the new \"wl\" module.\n\nThis solution addresses both the filesystem corruption problem and the subsequent WiFi driver compatibility issue with the new kernel.

I'be been thinking about this and I am not coming up with anything. My understanding is that extensive variables (at least wrt usual energies) scales with mass or length (system size). It also seems that some 'energies' depend upon the model used, such as how strong the interactions are in neighbors of atoms or dipoles, etc., or whether one is considering chemical potential or not, etc.\n\nAny good suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, that is entirely true. All this \"junk\" is usually separated in two categories: *space debris* (man\\-made), and *micro\\-meteoroids* (natural origins). \n\nMicro\\-meteoroids\n-----------------\n\nMicro\\-meteoroids are not as common as you might think. Even when you fly straight through the asteroid belt, micrometeorite impacts will be extremely unlikely. This is because small objects (dust, comet debris,\u00a0...) get pushed out of the Solar system by solar radiation pressure, are very likely to fall on a nearby asteroid, be caught in some planet's gravity field (Jupiter, mostly), etc. In short, small celestial bodies (in the order of cm or less) generally have a very short life span on astronomical time scales. \n\nThey *can* however be a problem near Jupiter for instance, which, because of its large mass, is a gravitational sink for these small objects. Even though they won't live there for very long, there are just so many of them flowing into Jupiter's gravity well all the time that they might just pose a problem. They haven't caused any major problems in exploration missions yet, but nevertheless, the [Galileo spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_%28spacecraft%29) and most others flying to or past Jupiter were equipped with micro\\-meteoroid impact protection systems around the most critical components. \n\nSpace debris\n------------\n\nSpace debris is a very active field of study. As it is man\\-made, it is only a problem of any size for spacecraft *near the Earth*. The importance of most near\\-Earth satellites and the threat space debris poses to them is why [NORAD keeps track of most space debris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#NORAD.2C_Gabbard_and_Kessler) in the vicinity of Earth. Information gathered by NORAD is used by space mission designers, so that they can design a spacecraft's trajectory such that it avoids collisions with larger (\\>\\~10cm) chunks of space debris. \n\nAlthough this prevents most catastrophic collisions, it is very difficult if not impossible to track all the smaller objects (\\<\\~10cm). There are unfortunately many millions of such things close to the Eartch, which sometimes indeed leads to impact. Solar panels from the ISS returned to Earth are riddled with holes, dents, scratches, etc., all resulting from impacts with space debris. The ISS has a lot of shields all over able to withstand impact with objects smaller than a few mm. For instance, the windows of the ISS are not simply a few layers of glass; there's pressure panes, primary shield, secondary shield, scratch panes, etc. Teh overall thickness of a window can exceed 40cm. The shield in front of a window is designed to be strong enough to break any impacting particle up into lower\\-mass dust, which then sprays out over the deliberate spacing between the primary shield and auxiliary pressure pane, the latter of which is then able to withstand the lower energy impact of the dust. It's kind of like bullet\\-proof glass, but then for bullets travelling several km/s :) \n\nSpace debris is not *really* a problem yet, because even though there is a large number of objects orbiting the Earth, the volume they fly through is so vast that the average density is still very low. But, when things like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#China) happen, there is a *major* impact on many space missions, existing and future ones. When not taken seriously between now and \\~15 years, space debris might indeed become a real threat, possibly even leading to the [Kessler syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the difference between micro-meteoroids and space debris, and their potential impacts on space missions?\n\nA) Micro-meteoroids are more common than space debris and pose a greater threat to missions near Jupiter, while space debris is only a concern for Earth-orbiting satellites.\n\nB) Space debris is tracked by NORAD and can be avoided by careful mission planning, whereas micro-meteoroids are too small to track and require specialized shielding on spacecraft.\n\nC) Micro-meteoroids are primarily a concern near Earth, while space debris is a major issue for missions to outer planets like Jupiter.\n\nD) Both micro-meteoroids and space debris pose equal threats to all space missions, regardless of their location in the solar system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the key differences between micro-meteoroids and space debris as described in the passage. Space debris, being larger and near Earth, can be tracked by NORAD and avoided through mission planning. Micro-meteoroids, on the other hand, are too small to track individually and require specialized shielding on spacecraft, such as the multi-layered windows on the ISS designed to break up small particles on impact.\n\nOption A is incorrect because micro-meteoroids are actually less common than space debris near Earth, and space debris is not limited to Earth-orbiting satellites. \n\nOption C reverses the locations where these threats are most prominent - micro-meteoroids are more of a concern in outer solar system locations like near Jupiter, while space debris is primarily an Earth-orbit issue.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the threats are not equal across all locations; space debris is mainly a near-Earth problem, while micro-meteoroids vary in prevalence throughout the solar system."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/18", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/56740", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/341/"], "docs_id": 56740, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a sentinel, and one of my primary reasons for picking the class was I liked the idea of having an ability that improved my shields, since I'm not so great at avoiding being hit.

It's kind of easy to miss, so I've at times set it off when I was trying to activate it. If you're playing on single player, you might be able to go by the powers that are active on the power wheel.

The first activation reduces damage taken by the player but also increases power cooldowns as a trade-off. The second activation detonates the Tech Armor, causing damage to nearby enemies.

The simpler ones have a fully diff output, i.e. the output is not referenced to ground but is the difference between two terminals. You build the usual non inverting amp with the inputs and the positive output, and feed \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V to the negative output. This *might* work but not all op amps like an output to be set to a specific voltage.\n\nIf you can use an instrumentation amplifier that would be much better. It is not an opamp but it is a single component. INAMPS need no external feedback, that's built in, and they usually have some very precise preset gain, or you can set it eithger with a control voltage or digitally. The output usually have a reference terminal: that is where you want to hook your \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V, and that terminal is though exactly for this purpose.\n\nTo vary the offset you can set the ref voltage with a potentiometer, maybe add some safety resistors in order to not let the ref terminal swing the full \\\\$\\\\pm 15\\\\$V: the inamp might not like it as well as your subsequent circuit.\n\nAs hinted in the comments, if your supplies are not well regulated using a mere divider to get the \\\\$\\-4\\.25\\\\$V won't work: you will need a linear regulator and a divider after that.\n\nIf you absolutely need to do that with a single ended, single op amp there is a circuit:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4Icl.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fU4Icl.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nSome analysis leads to:\n$$\nV\\_{out} \\= \\\\left(1\\+\\\\frac{R\\_2}{R\\_1}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{R\\_3\\+R\\_4}\\\\left(V\\_sR\\_4\\+ER\\_3\\\\right) \n$$\nthat is in the form \\\\$V\\_{out}\\=\\\\alpha V\\_s \\+ \\\\beta E\\\\$ with \\\\$\\\\alpha\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\beta\\\\$ positive. \n\nJust work out some values for the resistors if you want to build this last circuit, but the INAMP solution is the best you can get.\n\n**pros and cons** of each solution:\n\n**INAMP** pros: it's designed to do what you want, your only concern is the offset voltage but that is a concern for every solution. cons: costs and power consumption.\n\n**FULLY DIFF AMP** pros: it's easy and cheap to set up, costs and power are just like a single ended opamp. cons: it probably won't work since you try to set one of the output rails to a fixed voltage\n\n**SINGLE OPAMP** pros: dirty cheap and easy, fits the spec. cons: do you see that ton of resistors? they are bad. they are not precise, they need space, they are bad creatures.

Points falling close to the line is evidence of normality, not evidence in favor of being Cauchy distributed (EDIT: Disregard these last 2 sentences; a QQ Cauchy plot \\- not a QQ norm plot \\- was used, which is fine.) The Poisson distribution, used for modeling count data, is inappropriate since the variance is much larger than the mean. The Binomial distribution is also inappropriate since theoretically, your response variable has no upper bound. I'd look into the negative binomial distribution. \n\nAs a final note, your data does not necessarily have to come from a well known, \"named\" distribution.

The reduced holonomy implies that these manifolds have vanishing Ricci curvature and hence are automatically solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity.\n\nHowever, physics does not take place on a Riemannian manifold, but rather on a Lorentzian one. Thus my question is: what is known about special holonomy manifolds for metrics of general signature? (I am most interested in the (1,n) case!) In particular I would like to know if there is a classification of allowed holonomy groups and further if there are interesting examples that I should be aware of.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it would be more accurate to say that the real reason why\nCalabi\\-Yau, hyperk\u00e4hler, $G\\_2$ and $\\\\mathrm{Spin}(7\\)$ manifolds are of\ninterest in string theory is not their Ricci\\-flatness, but the fact\nthat they admit parallel spinor fields. Of course, in\npositive\\-definite signature, existence of parallel spinor fields\nimplies Ricci\\-flatness, but the converse is still open for compact\nriemannian manifolds, as discussed in [this\nquestion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16818/are-there-ricci-flat-riemannian-manifolds-with-generic-holonomy), and known to fail for noncompact manifolds as pointed\nout in an answer to that question.\n\nThe similar question for lorentzian manifolds has a bit of history.\nFirst of all, the holonomy principle states that a spin manifold\nadmits parallel spinor fields if and only if (the spin lift of) its\nholonomy group is contained in the stabilizer subgroup of a nonzero\nspinor. Some low\\-dimensional (i.e., $\\\\leq 11$, the cases relevant to\nstring and M\\-theories) investigations (by [Robert Bryant](http://arXiv.org/abs/math.DG/0004073) and [myself](http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/9904124),\nindependently) suggested that these subgroups are either of two types:\nsubgroups $G \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n) \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(1,n)$, whence $G$ is\nthe ones corresponding to the cases 5\\-8 in the question, or else $G \\=\nH \\\\ltimes \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\-1}$, where $H \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n\\-1\\)$ is one of\nthe groups in cases 5\\-8 in the question. Thomas Leistner showed that\nthis persisted in the general case and, as Igor pointed out in his\nanswer, arrived at a classification of possible lorentzian holonomy\ngroups. Anton Galaev then constructed metrics with all the possible\nholonomy groups, showing that they all arise. Their work is reviewed\nin [their\npaper](http://dx.doi.org/10.4171/051-1/2) ([MR2436228](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2436228)).\n\nThe basic difficulty in the indefinite\\-signature case is that the de\nRham decomposition theorem is modified. Recall that the de Rham\ndecomposition theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a complete, connected\nand simply connected positive\\-definite riemannian manifold and if the\nholonomy group acts reducibly, then the manifold is a riemannian\nproduct, whence it is enough to restrict to irreducible holonomy\nrepresentations. This is by no means a trivial problem, but is\ntractable.\n\nIn contrast, in the indefinite signature situation, there is a\nmodification of this theorem due to Wu, which says that it is not\nenough for the holonomy representation to be reducible, it has to be\n*nondegenerately* reducible. This means that it is fully reducible\nand the direct sums in the decomposition are orthogonal with respect\nto the metric. This means that it is therefore not enough to restrict\noneself to irreducible holonomy representations. For example,\nB\u00e9rard\\-Bergery and Ikemakhen proved that the only lorentzian holonomy\ngroup acting irreducibly is $\\\\mathrm{SO}\\_0(1,n)$ itself: namely, the\ngeneric holonomy group.\n\nIt should be pointed out that in indefinite signature, the\nintegrability condition for the existence of parallel spinor fields is\nnot Ricci\\-flatness. Instead, it's that the image of the Ricci\noperator $S: TM \\\\to TM$, defined by $g(S(X),Y) \\= r(X,Y)$, with $r$ the\nRicci curvature, be isotropic. Hence if one is interested in\nsupersymmetric solutions of supergravity theories (without fluxes) one\nis interested in Ricci\\-flat lorentzian manifolds (of the relevant\ndimension) admitting parallel spinor fields.

In Lorentzian manifolds, the existence of parallel spinor fields does not necessarily imply Ricci-flatness, unlike in the Riemannian case. The integrability condition for parallel spinors in Lorentzian geometry is that the image of the Ricci operator be isotropic, which is a weaker condition than Ricci-flatness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the classification of holonomy groups for Lorentzian manifolds is different from that of Riemannian manifolds, as shown by the work of Leistner and Galaev.\n\nOption B is false because, as mentioned in the text, Ricci-flatness is not the integrability condition for parallel spinors in Lorentzian geometry.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the de Rham decomposition theorem is modified in the indefinite signature case, as explained by Wu's theorem."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/263054", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/23935/"], "docs_id": 263054, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a general (integral) solution to $du(t)\\= \\-a(t)u(t)\\\\,dt \\+\\\\sigma(t)\\\\,dz$?

Such reference points **may** mark a division between two items, but they don't always do; that is not a part of the meaning of *landmark*. Eiffel Tower, for example, is a landmark, in the literal sense, but it does not divide Paris into two parts in any significant way. Consequently, if one uses *landmark* metaphorically for an event in somebody's life, it only means that the event is noteworthy, memorable, suitable to use as a reference point. Although turning points usually serve as landmarks in that metaphorical sense, calling something a landmark does not mean that it is a turning point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the difference between 'watershed' and 'landmark' when used metaphorically to describe events in someone's life?\n\nA) A watershed always implies a significant change, while a landmark is simply a memorable event.\nB) A landmark always divides life into two distinct periods, but a watershed doesn't necessarily do so.\nC) Both watershed and landmark always indicate turning points in life, with no significant difference in meaning.\nD) A watershed implies a division or separation, while a landmark may or may not represent a turning point.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key difference between 'watershed' and 'landmark' when used metaphorically is that a watershed always implies a division or separation between two periods or states, much like its literal meaning in geography. A landmark, on the other hand, simply refers to a noteworthy or memorable event that can serve as a reference point. While a landmark can sometimes represent a turning point or division, this is not inherent to its meaning. Therefore, option D accurately captures this distinction, highlighting that a watershed necessarily implies a division, while a landmark may or may not represent a turning point in someone's life."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/168486", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/39294/"], "docs_id": 168486, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The context: \nWe are working on a multi\\-threaded (Linux\\-C) application that follows a pipeline model. \n\nEach module has a private thread and encapsulated objects which do processing of data; and each stage has a standard form of exchanging data with next unit. \n\nThe application is free from memory leak and is threadsafe using locks at the point where they exchange data.

It provides a centralized logging mechanism (solving the multiple file issue), doesn't block the main application threads (improving performance), and maintains event ordering. The producer-consumer model allows for efficient gathering of log messages without creating a global lock, making it suitable for high-performance, multi-threaded applications."}}
