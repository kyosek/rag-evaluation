While option A (relying on user flags) is mentioned as being sufficient for larger sites, it's noted as potentially problematic for beta sites.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it provides a practical solution that doesn't require changes to the Stack Exchange system. The top answer suggests using a Greasemonkey script to display the number of spam/offensive flags in the top bar, allowing moderators to quickly see if there are potential spam posts needing attention, even when not in \"mod mode\".\n\nOption C, while related to the original user's suggestion, is not presented as an implemented or guaranteed solution in the documentation.\n\nOption D is impractical and time-consuming, especially for busy moderators managing multiple sites.\n\nThe Greasemonkey script solution (B) offers a balance between moderator awareness and efficient use of existing tools, making it the most effective approach based on the information provided."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/07", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/278448", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/2689/"], "docs_id": 278448, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to get a better understanding of how one would structure an API in C. \n\n* I create a struct `Person`\n* I have a `init` function that sets data on that struct\n* I have multiple \"helper\" functions that work on that struct\n\nI'm wondering if the following code in C can be considered idiomatic from the point of view of more seasoned C developers.\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\ntypedef struct Person Person;\n\nstruct Person\n{\n    unsigned int age;\n    unsigned int weight;\n    Person *next_person;\n};\n\nvoid person_init(Person *p, unsigned int age, unsigned int weight, Person *next_person) \n{\n    p->age = age;\n    p->weight = weight;\n    p->next_person = next_person;\n}\n\nvoid person_print(Person *p)\n{\n    printf(\"person is %dy old\\n\", p->age);\n    printf(\"person weight is %dkg\\n\", p->weight);\n}\n\nint main(void) \n{\n    Person p1, p2, p3, p4;\n    Person *p_cur;\n\n    person_init(&p1, 28, 80, &p2);    \n    person_print(&p1);\n\n    person_init(&p2, 58, 93, &p3);  \n    person_print(&p2);\n\n    person_init(&p3, 60, 60, &p4);  \n    person_print(&p3);\n\n    person_init(&p4, 78, 50, NULL);  \n    person_print(&p4);\n\n    printf(\"==================\\n\");\n\n    p_cur = &p1;\n\n    while (p_cur != NULL) {\n        person_print(p_cur);\n        p_cur = p_cur->next_person;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nIn particular I'm unsure about the **signature of the functions** in general and about the use of a `Person *` pointer. \n\nWhen is it OK to not\\-pass a pointer but the struct/char array directly? \n\nIn most APIs I have seen so far, a pointer to the struct/char array is passed, like [`snprintf(char * s, ... )`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/snprintf/). But sometimes, like in [`getline(char **lineptr, ...)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getline.3.html) even a `char **` is passed. Why? When make the distinction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on what kind of I/O you're after. I think that table is primarily looking at system calls, and the stdin/stdout interface to a console windows or terminal. System calls simply don't exist in Javascript, and there's no stdin/stdout\\-style console window either, so I assume that's why it's not listed (though you can make a case for node.js here).\n\nThe closest thing I know of to failsafe\\-ness in vanilla Javascript is that calling a function that doesn't exist or accessing a resource that hasn't been loaded will throw an exception. But everything that is available generally \"just works\" without any error codes or exceptions. Assigning text to innerHTML or using HTML5 canvas methods won't throw if the browser \"fails to render\" the result somehow (at least, if it does, that's not documented/standardized behavior). Also note that Javascript has no (cross\\-browser) filesystem API, which is the one thing I can think of where error codes/exceptions would effectively be mandatory. And, Javascript's closest equivalent to console I/O\\-\\-the console.log() function\\-\\-also isn't standard, meaning you're never supposed to use it in production code anyway.\n\nSo as far as I can tell, the sort of \"I/O\" where \"failsafe\" is a meaningful property to ask about doesn't really exist in Javascript. Simply leaving it out of the table probably was the best way to represent it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In C programming, when designing an API with structs and functions, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding function parameters and pointers?\n\nA) Functions should always pass structs by value to ensure data integrity.\nB) Using double pointers (e.g., char **) is the preferred method for all string operations.\nC) The choice between passing a pointer or passing by value depends on the specific use case and performance considerations.\nD) Pointers should never be used when working with structs to avoid potential memory issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

So, an alternative approach is to user `super`, which uses the MRO (see Option 1\\) to determine which base implementation to use. By using MRO, it avoids diamond inheritance problems.

The main predicate is *be difficult*, a predicate adjective, which uses *be* as an auxiliary, like all predicate adjectives and nouns. The other clauses are subordinate to the main clause.\n\nIf *is difficult* is the main verb phrase, what's it's subject? Well, everything else in the sentence. \n\n> (Except *it*. The *it* is a meaningless dummy, introduced by the syntactic rule of [Extraposition](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/419328/15299).)\n\n*Knowing which one to pick* is also a clause, a gerund clause with *knowing* as the gerund main verb of the clause. But every English clause needs an English subject, so whose knowing are we talking about? It's not clear. \n\n*Anybody at all, everybody, somebody, whoever you like*. It's **indefinite** who the subject is (except it does have to be a ***Who***, not a ***What***, because that's required for the subject of *know*), and since it's not there, we just don't know. But we can tell that the subject is some indefinite human, and not somebody mentioned in the conversation, so we'll just call it `Indef`, which of course, is not pronounced. Like apostrophes.\n\nSo the subject of *is difficult* is the clause\n\n* *`Indef` knowing which one to choose*\n\nand together the sentence is pronounced \n\n* *Knowing which one to choose is difficult.*\n\nThis is the sentence that's left when you unwind Extraposition. That moves a heavy subject like a gerund clause to the end of the sentence where it's easier to process, and leaves behind a dummy *It* (normally contracted to *It's* when the predicate is an adjective, as here) behind to fool us into thinking there's a subject still there so we can get to the verb fast. There are a lot of rules in English that do this, in various ways to various kinds of construction, but always in order to put heavy stuff at the end of the sentence.\n\nBut we're not done. The gerund subordinate clause *knowing which one to choose* has a subordinate clause itself: *which one to choose* is a *Wh*\\-infinitive clause, and once again its subject is missing, and once again it's indefinite.\n\n*Somebody* (indefinite) is to choose *something* (also indefinite, so it may be *somebody* instead) from a limited set of things (or people). That's the sense of *which one* instead of *what*, which could be plural and isn't limited in scope.\n\n*Wh*\\-infinitives are very restricted and have extremely peculiar syntax. The subject of *choose* is `Indef`, but the object is *which one*, moved to the front as a relative pronoun. *One* in *which one* is the indefinite singular pronoun, standing for some noun that is understood in the discourse. We don't know what (or who) is being chosen, nor by whom, but the speaker is relying on the addressee knowing what noun *one* stands for. This is not \"indefinite\" in the same logical sense \\-\\- we still don't know which one, but we know what kind of ones we're talking about.\n\nThe *Wh*\\-infinitive is the direct object of *knowing*, so that makes it a noun clause, a complement of *know*. The gerund clause itself is the subject of *is difficult*, so that makes it a noun clause, too. And of course there's Extraposition.

That will get you above the 2930 psi from your friend's calculations. So let's start there.\n\nThat LVL comes in (among other sizes) 3\\.5\" x 7\\.25\", which is really close to your existing doubled 2x8\\. In fact, it's enough bigger that it'll give you I (\\=bh3/12\\)) of 111\\.1 in4, up from the 90\\.4 in4 of your current beam.\n\nBending\n=======\n\nSo then your bending stress (fb\\=MC/I) becomes (74390 \\* 3\\.625\\)/111\\.1 \\= 2426\\.2 psi. That's below the 2930 psi allowable, so that will work.\n\nShear\n=====\n\nThe allowable shear for that LVL is 4821 pounds \\-\\- well above the 1725 pounds that you need to carry.\n\nDeflection\n==========\n\nThe LVL also has a higher modulus of elasticity (E) than typical dimensional lumber, but will have a smaller I than the triple 2x12, so let's check.\n\nDeflection \\= 5WL4/384EI \\= 5 \\* 20 \\* 172\\.54 / 384 \\* 2,000,000 \\* 111\\.1 \\= 1\\.04 inches. That's slightly over the 0\\.96 inches allowed.

This approach involves:\n\n1. Running tasks that need to interact with the RDS database against the \"localhost\".\n2. Using separate variable files for each environment (e.g., production.yml, staging.yml) that contain RDS endpoints and credentials.\n3. Loading the appropriate variable file at the beginning of the play using vars_files.\n4. Specifying the environment variable when running the playbook (e.g., ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars \"env=production\").\n\nThis method is flexible, maintains separation of concerns, and doesn't require modifying core Ansible scripts or creating complex custom inventory solutions. It also allows for easy management of different environments by simply switching the variable file used.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modifying core Ansible scripts is not recommended and can lead to maintenance issues.\nOption B is less efficient as it requires maintaining separate inventory files and doesn't solve the dynamic aspect of the problem.\nOption D is overly complex and would require significant custom development, which is unnecessary given the simpler solution available."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/07/18", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/42438", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/12106/"], "docs_id": 42438, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to the comments in Xen's `network-bridge` script, the process of starting the bridge with external interface eth0 is thus:\n\n```\n# Creates the bridge\n# Copies the IP and MAC addresses from eth0 to veth0\n# Renames eth0 to be peth0\n# Renames veth0 to be eth0\n# Enslaves peth0, veth0 to bridge\n\n```\n\nNOTE: that doesn't actually seem to be what the script does.

For instance, you have a stereographic projection tangent at lat/long (1,2\\), so if your data is not somewhere in Central Africa, then your projection is likely to be inappropriate. \n\nWhat makes me think that there is a potential problem with your projection is the value of your false easting and northing (\\+x\\_0 and \\+y\\_0\\). With your unit being meters, a shift of 6 or 7 meters does not make sense. Those values could be degrees, so you should convert them into meter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS analyst is working with a TIF file that has a stereographic projection. The projection string is '+proj=stere +lat_0=1 +lon_0=2 +k=1 +x_0=6 +y_0=7 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'. What is the most likely issue with this projection, and what should be the first step to verify its correctness?\n\nA) The projection is incorrect because stereographic projections are not suitable for Central Africa. The analyst should immediately reproject the data to a UTM zone.\n\nB) The false easting and northing values (x_0 and y_0) are suspiciously small for meter units. The analyst should first visually compare the data with reference data from another projection to check for consistency.\n\nC) The latitude and longitude of origin (lat_0 and lon_0) are incorrect. The analyst should change these values to the center coordinates of the dataset.\n\nD) The scale factor (k) should not be 1 for a stereographic projection. The analyst should adjust this value based on the standard parallel of the area of interest.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely issue with this projection is that the false easting and northing values (x_0=6 and y_0=7) are unusually small if they're meant to be in meters. Typically, these values would be much larger to avoid negative coordinates. The first step to verify the projection's correctness is to visually compare it with reference data from another known projection. This allows the analyst to check for consistency and identify any obvious misalignments or distortions before making any changes. The other options either make assumptions that aren't necessarily true (A and C) or suggest changes that may not be necessary or correct (D)."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/11/27", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/278006", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/650405/"], "docs_id": 278006, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From the 3 most important things I use 2 is already on the top\\-bar (well done):\n\n* The Inbox\n* The Reputation (Achievements)\n\nThe 3rd thing I frequently need is the *Activity tab*.\n\nI often get new ideas/solutions, or realize that I made a mistake, or want to make some edits, see what others posted, etc. You get the idea.

I'll get to it later. Once you have the script, all you have to do is to execute it. As suggested before, edit your \\~/.bashrc file and add at the end a line containing the path to your script. For example, if you have the script in your home folder and the script's filename is \"cowscript\", then you could add the following line at the end of your \\~/.bashrc file:\n\n```\n$HOME/cowscript\n\n```\n\nNow, the script used in Linux Mint 9 is the following:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nRANGE=4\n\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        cow=\"small\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        cow=\"tux\"\n        ;;\n    2)\n        cow=\"koala\"\n        ;;\n    3)\n        cow=\"moose\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nRANGE=2\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowsay\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowthink\"\n        ;;\nesac\n/usr/games/fortune | $command -f $cow\n\n```\n\nBasically, it will display a random cow (either *small*, *tux*, *koala*, or *moose*) and the message will be taken from fortune. Also, this script will execute wither *cowsay* or *cowthink*, the only difference being that *cowthink* will display a thinking cow instead of a talking cow.\n\nNow, the fun thing is that you can modify the script to show more cows or to show different cows. To do that, you first need to know what cows you have installed. In a terminal, run:\n\n```\ncowsay -l\n\n```\n\nYou can use any of those cows. All you have to do is to edit the script: if you want to add a new cow, just copy the lines containing \"cow\" (plus the number and semi\\-colons) and paste them before the line that says \"esac\". Then, change the number and name of the cow, so for instance, if you want to add a cow called \"udder\", all you have to do is to add these lines before the first \"esac\":\n\n```\n4)\n    cow=\"udder\"\n    ;;\n\n```\n\n**Important**: the second line of the file, \"RANGE\\=4\", must be changed also. If you add one cow, then instead of 4 use 5, also if you delete one cow, then you must use 3, and so on. Also note that the numbers that you see must be in the range from 0 to *RANGE \\- 1*. That's why RANGE is 4 and the numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3\\.\n\nYou could also create your own cows, although that might take a bit more of work. All you have to do is to get any ASCII art you like and edit it, but it is a bit tricky. You can see how it's done here: [http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow\\-to\\-make\\-a\\-cow\\-talk\\-on\\-terminal\\-startup/](http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow-to-make-a-cow-talk-on-terminal-startup/) However, consider that any **@** and **\\\\** symbols need to be backslashed, that is, you must put before that symbol this other symbol: **\\\\**. This might be the case for **\\#**, too (but not always). If your ASCII Art contains **\\#**, you could backslash it too, but sometimes it would be enough with just one of them... I'm not sure how to explain it, sorry. I guess you will have to try to see if it works. Also, make sure that the file you edit has the extension \".cow\"\n\nFinally, once you have your own cows, you can either add them to the default location (you probably will need to be superuser for that) at /usr/share/cowsay/cows, or you could add to your \\~/.bashrc file this lines:\n\n```\nexport COWPATH=\"/usr/share/cowsay/cows\"\n# set COWPATH so it includes user's cows\nif [ -d \"$HOME/cowfiles\" ] ; then\n    COWPATH=\"$COWPATH:$HOME/cowfiles\"\nfi\n\n```\n\nBe sure to add those lines before you call your \"cowscript\". This also assumes that you have a folder called \"cowfiles\" on your home folder. Change the path if you want so it points to the folder where you have your cowfiles."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to customize your Linux terminal to display a random cowsay message on startup.

You may have a look there to get some arguments, however please answer this question in an objective way as you should on Stackoverflow.\nIf you want to participate into the discussion please comment on GitHub instead.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a key difference between an issue tracker and the repository itself:  \n\n**The issue tracker isn't distributed with the repository**\n\nWhen one downloads the library or does a `git clone https://github.com/jsmith/acme`, the license that the library and code is distributed under *needs to be there*. Consider the situation where someone had their code on Google Code, or Source Forge with the license in the issue tracker over there and then migrated the project to github... and there's no hint of a license file any more.\n\nSpecifically with GitHub and its culture of forking, one should also look at what one sees when downloading or cloning from a *fork*. There isn't even a hint of an issue containing the license in the forked code. For that matter, the fork might have enabled its *own* issues on there and claiming a WTFPL license on it (anyone downloading from the fork and going to `https://github.com/sjane/acme/issues/97` hinted at by someone as containing the license in it could see something completely different than the MIT).\n\nThe license needs to be distributed with the library and source files. Otherwise there is no license on them and it makes the legal department rather twitchy.\n\nFurthermore, issue trackers aren't tied to a revision. Consider if jsmith later decides to switch from MIT to GPL (as the only author, perfectly acceptable). And now... what's the license? There's one issue here that says its MIT and another one there that says its GPL. If I clone from revision 1, what license is it under? What about if I clone from revision 2?\n\nThe only way to resolve this is if the license is part of the distribution itself. Posting it in an issue tracker doesn't actually identify the license that a given revision is under. Nor does posting it in an issue tracker allow me to redistribute the code under the license I (might have) received it under when that issue tracker is gone."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is considering placing the license for their open-source project in the issue tracker of their GitHub repository instead of a traditional LICENSE file.
