I read that Einstein first thought of this tensor to be the one that goes into his field equation but it didn't fit. Now, I know why this was problematic. There is a clear explanation of that. What I am asking is, is there a formulation of theory of gravity where equations give us directly $R$ and not $G$? $G$ is Einsteins tensor and $R$ Riemanns. Because, non\\-relativistic equation was used and directly translated, with energy\\-momentum tensor. Is there some other tensor related to the physics which would give $R$ instead of $G$? $G$ itself is not curvature...but from $G$ I guess we could calculate $R$ so there should be some equation that gives $R$ directly?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The formulation you are looking for exists. Starting off from Einstein's field equations: ($R\\_{ik}$ Ricci tensor, $R$ curvature scalar and $T\\_{ik}$ the stress tensor and $g\\_{ik}$ the metric tensor, $\\\\kappa\\=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}$ with $G$ gravitational constant)\n\n$$R\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2}g\\_{ik} R \\= \\\\kappa T\\_{ik}$$\n\nOne can alternatively move one index up in all tensors:\n\n$$R\\_i^k \\-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta\\_i^k R \\= \\\\kappa T\\_i^k$$\n\nand then taking the trace (we put the indices $i$ and $k$ equal and sum over it according to Einstein's summation convention):\n\n$$ R \\= \\- \\\\kappa T$$\n\nwith $T \\= T\\_i^i\\\\equiv\\\\sum^3\\_{i\\=0} T\\_i^i$. We substitute this expression for $R$ in Einstein's original field equations and bring the term with $T$ on the right side:\n\n$$ R\\_{ik} \\= \\\\kappa\\\\left(T\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} g\\_{ik} T\\\\right)$$ \n\nand if you like with the Riemann curvature tensor according to the definition of the Ricci tensor $R\\_{ik}:\\=g^{lm} R\\_{limk}$\n\n$$ g^{lm} R\\_{limk} \\= \\\\kappa\\\\left(T\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} g\\_{ik} T\\\\right)$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In an alternative formulation of Einstein's field equations, the Riemann curvature tensor is directly related to the stress-energy tensor. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this formulation?\n\nA) The equation g^lm R_limk = \u03ba(T_ik - 1/2 g_ik T) shows that the Riemann curvature tensor is directly proportional to the stress-energy tensor.\n\nB) The trace of the alternative formulation R = -\u03baT implies that the curvature scalar is inversely proportional to the trace of the stress-energy tensor.\n\nC) In this formulation, the Ricci tensor R_ik is expressed solely in terms of the stress-energy tensor T_ik, without involving the metric tensor g_ik.\n\nD) The equation R_ik = \u03ba(T_ik - 1/2 g_ik T) demonstrates that the Ricci tensor is a linear combination of the stress-energy tensor and its trace, scaled by the gravitational coupling constant.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the equation R_ik = \u03ba(T_ik - 1/2 g_ik T) directly expresses the Ricci tensor R_ik in terms of the stress-energy tensor T_ik, its trace T, and the metric tensor g_ik, all scaled by the gravitational coupling constant \u03ba. This formulation shows a clear relationship between spacetime curvature (represented by the Ricci tensor) and the distribution of matter and energy (represented by the stress-energy tensor).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the equation involves the Riemann curvature tensor, it's not directly proportional to the stress-energy tensor. The relationship is more complex.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while R = -\u03baT does show an inverse relationship, it's not about proportionality but equality with a negative sign.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the formulation still involves the metric tensor g_ik in the second term."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/12/18", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/466397", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/178025/"], "docs_id": 466397, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was looking at [this page](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3907111) for how to set up a short bibliography in LaTeX.

The arrow will open the box and release the item.\n* Whip a wearable item to move it forward in front of the trap.\n* Blow up the trap with a bomb. Watch out for the arrow, as this will not be destroyed and can sometimes fly up into the air.\n* Destroy the trap with a mattock.\n* Throw a rope down in front of the trap. If you crouch next to a ledge and use a rope it will go downwards.\n* You can pick up critters (rat, frog, penguin, cricket) and drop them down in front of the arrow trap to set it off. Critters you are carrying will also soak up arrows, like bodies.\n* You can hit an arrow with your whip as long as there is at least two spaces between you and the trap.\n* It is possible to trigger an arrow trap but avoid the arrow if you are falling fast enough and there are enough spaces between you and the trap. Be careful, however, as the arrow can ricochet off walls and spear you anyway.\n\nYou will always begin the game next to a throwable item.

The first variable (X1) is from NWP software and has a strong correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.564). When adding a second variable (X2), the overall R\u00b2 increases only marginally to 0.565. However, due to the large sample size (n = 2949), the partial F-test indicates statistical significance. Which of the following statements best describes how to interpret these results and proceed with the analysis?\n\nA) The researcher should include X2 in the model because the partial F-test shows statistical significance, regardless of the small increase in R\u00b2.\n\nB) The researcher should disregard the partial F-test results and only consider the change in R\u00b2 when deciding whether to include X2 in the model.\n\nC) The researcher should determine a substantively meaningful change in R\u00b2 for their specific field and base the decision to include X2 on whether the observed change meets this threshold, rather than relying solely on statistical significance.\n\nD) The researcher should reduce the sample size to make the partial F-test less sensitive, allowing for a fairer assessment of X2's contribution to the model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to determine what change in R\u00b2 is substantively meaningful in the context of solar radiation prediction. Statistical significance, especially with large sample sizes, doesn't always indicate practical importance.

I suggest you use a transconductance amplifier such as the TI LM13700 to implement a simple audio filter for an analog synthesizer. They are widely used for this application. Basically the transconductor gives you a gm (kind of a 1/R) and you dump the resulting current into a cap. This gives you the C for your 1/RC cutoff. Check out the datasheet for this part here: [TI LM13700 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm13700.pdf)\n\nFigure 3 in the datasheet will give you a starting point for a very simple VCF.

In this sense there is no drift term.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a way think of the extra term $\\\\mu$ coming from the connection. For a smooth function $f : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$, from the smooth structure alone, you can always form the differential $Df \\\\in \\\\Gamma^{\\\\infty}(T^{\\\\ast} M)$ as smooth section of the cotangent bundle. Without a connection, you can think of $Df : TM \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ as a map between smooth manifolds, differentiate again, and this gives\n$$\nD^2 f : TTM \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nI used $D$ for the differential so as not to confuse this with the exterior derivative $d$ which would have $d^2 \\= 0$.\n\nNow if you have a [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection), you can split $TTM$ as\n$$\nTTM \\\\simeq VTM \\\\oplus HTM\n$$\ninto [vertical and horizontal sub\\-bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_and_horizontal_bundles). In this particular case both $VTM$ and $HTM$ are isomorphic to $TM$. $VTM$ is the kernel of the map $d\\\\pi : TTM \\\\to TM$ where $\\\\pi: TM \\\\to M$ is the bundle projection and this is isomorphic to $TM$. The connection allows you to \"split\" the map $d\\\\pi : TTM \\\\to TM$ obtaining an injective bundle morphism $TM \\\\to TTM$ complementary to $VTM \\\\simeq TM$ whose image I'll denoted $HTM$. The vertical bundle consists of elements of $TTM$ that are tangent to the fibres of $TM$ while the horizontal bundles consists of elements of $TTM$ that are tangent to the base $M$.\n\nTo help clarify, for a general vector bundle $\\\\pi : E \\\\to M$, the kernel $VE$ of $d\\\\pi : TE \\\\to TM$ is isomorphic to $E$ and a connection gives a splitting $TM \\\\to TE$ whose image is denoted $HE$ and such that $TE \\\\simeq VE \\\\oplus HE \\\\simeq E \\\\oplus TM$.\n\nNow, what this all has to do with \"drift\" is that under the identification $TTM \\\\simeq TM \\\\oplus TM$, the $g^{ij} \\\\partial\\_{ij}$ term comes from $VE$ \\- it's the term tangent to the fibre and corresponds to $\\\\partial\\_{ij} f \\= D^2 f$. The other term \\- the one with the connection coefficients $\\\\Gamma$ corresponds to the part that is tangent to the base $M$.\n\nIn other words, the $g^{ij} \\\\partial\\_{ij}$ part arises from differentiating while moving along the fibres of $TM$ and the $\\\\Gamma$ part arises from moving along the base $M$.\n\n**Thus the drift is measuring the change in the fibres of the bundle $TM$ as measured by the connection as the basepoint $x \\\\in M$ varies.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold (M,g), what is the geometric interpretation of the term \u03bc^\u2113 = -g^jk \u0393^\u2113_jk?\n\nA) It represents the curvature of the manifold and has no relation to the connection.\n\nB) It is a measure of how the fibres of the tangent bundle TM change as the basepoint on M varies, as measured by the connection.\n\nC) It is solely responsible for the self-adjoint property of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\n\nD) It represents the part of the operator that is tangent to the fibres of TM and corresponds to \u2202_ij f = D^2 f.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The term \u03bc^\u2113 = -g^jk \u0393^\u2113_jk, often referred to as the \"drift\" term, arises from the connection on the manifold. It measures how the fibres of the tangent bundle TM change as the basepoint on M varies.

The entire operator, including both the g^ij \u2202_ij term and the \u03bc^\u2113 term, contributes to its properties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it describes the g^ij \u2202_ij part of the operator, not the \u03bc^\u2113 term.

Nevertheless I am also interested in the answer.\n\nThe question concerns relationships between Hilbert's 10th Problem (over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ and over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$) and the **Equations Problem** (EP) in certain groups. The EP in a group $G$ is (apparently; I am not an expert here) to algorithmically decide whether an equation with parameters in a group has a solution. In other words, let $G$ be a countably infinite group and let $\\\\{g\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}$ be an enumeration of the elements of $G$. An **equation** in $G$ is a word in the $g\\_i$'s and in some formal variables $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_N$ and their inverses, which is set equal to $1$. The EP is whether there is an algorithm which upon being given an equation, decides whether the equation has a solution in $G$, i.e., whether we can evaluate the indetermines to elements of $G$ so as to get a true identity. (Maybe this depends on the enumeration of the elements of $G$. If $G$ has a solvable word problem \\-\\- which I think is true for the groups which are coming \\-\\- then it shouldn't matter.)\n\n**Added**: It seems I didn't get the formalism right. Let's restrict to finitely presented groups with solvable word problem, and enumerate the elements as distinct words in the generators with respect to some reasonable lexicographic ordering. Or, if you like, part of the question is to ask exactly what EP means in this context: certainly it means something, as it has been studied by many people.\n\nMore formally, in the language of groups augmented by a constant for each element $g\\_i$ of $G$, the EP is asking whether the *positive existential theory* of $G$ is decidable.\n\nThe questions concern a much\\-cited 1979 paper of Romankov:\n\n---\n\nRoman\u02b9kov, V. A.\nUniversal theory of nilpotent groups. (Russian)\nMat. Zametki 25 (1979\\), no. 4, 487\u2013495, 635\\. \n\n---\n\nA feature of the situation is that I haven't been able to get my hands on the entire paper, so but here is the MathReview by O.V. Belegradek:\n\n> A finitely generated nilpotent group has a decidable theory if and only if it is abelian\\-by\\-finite \\[Ju. L. Er\u0161ov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 203 (1972\\), 1240\u20131243; MR0297840 (45 \\#6892\\)]. The author gives an example of a finitely generated 4\\-step nilpotent group with undecidable universal theory. The proof depends on Matijasevi\u010d's undecidability result for the universal theory of the ring of integers. A. I. Mal\u02b9cev \\[Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 50 (92\\) (1960\\), 257\u2013266; MR0118677 (22 \\#9448\\)] showed the undecidability of the theory of a free 2\\-step nilpotent group. The author proves that the decidability of the universal part of this theory is equivalent to the decidability of the universal theory of the field of rationals. {Reviewer's remark: A. M. Slobodsko\u012d and \u00c8. I. Fridman \\[5th All\\-Union Conference on Mathematical Logic, p. 140, Akad. Nauk SSSR Sibirsk. Otdel., Inst. Mat., Novosibirsk, 1979] have announced the decidability of the universal theory of the field of rationals.}\n\n**First Question**: There are many free $2$\\-step nilpotent groups: one such group, call it $N(2,m)$ for each rank $m \\\\geq 1$. Thus e.g. $N(2,2\\)$ is the standard Heisenberg group over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. Which group(s) does Romankov's decidability result refer to? \n\nMy guess on this: it should refer to $N(2,\\\\infty)$, the free $2$\\-step nilpotent group of countably infinite rank. I also guess that it shouldn't matter much, in that the universal theories of $N(2,n)$ should be the same for all $2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq \\\\infty$: I saw very similar results in the literature with solvable groups, and it seems very plausible.\n\n**Transition to the Second Question**: There are many places in the literature where Romankov's result is characterized as: \"Solving the equations problem in a free $2$\\-step nilpotent group is equivalent to Hilbert's 10th Problem over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\" Here are some instances:\n\n[Page 1 of this arxiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.1830.pdf), which has since been published.\n\n[This 1997 paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2275737)\n\nIn the MathScinet reivew of a 1995 paper: MR1351615\\. The reviewer is Romankov.\n\nBut now I'm a little confused. Hilbert's 10th problem (over any ring) concerns the positive existential theory of that ring: it's about whether solutions exist to polynomial equations. Similarly for the EP. If we could omit the word \"positive\" then, sure, the full existential theory of any structure is decidable iff the full universal theory is, since \n\n$\\\\exists x P(x)$ is true exactly when $\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\neg P(x)$ is false.\n\nSo let's define E/IP to be the group theory problem with equations or inequations. So it seems to me that Romankov's result is rather that decidability of E/IP for $N(2,\\\\infty)$ (and so perhaps also for $N(2,2\\)$ is my guess at Q1 is correct) is equivalent to the decidability of all polynomial equations *and inequations* over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$. It seems to me though that \"H10 over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$\" concerns equations only, so I wonder whether these inequations are actually necessary.\n\nThis question is equivalent to the definability of the set $R^{\\\\bullet} \\= R \\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}$ by a positive existential formula. Over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ this is well known to be the case: via Lagrange's Theorem that set is defined by \n\n$\\\\{y \\\\mid \\\\exists x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3,x\\_4 \\\\ x\\_1^2 \\+ x\\_2^2 \\+ x\\_3^2 \\+ x\\_4^2 \\+1\\= y^2\\\\}$\n\nI found in a survey article of T. Pheidas that for $R \\= \\\\mathbb{C}\\[\\[t]]$, $R^{\\\\bullet}$ is *not* positively existentially definable. But what about over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$?\n\n**Second Question**: Is it really true that EP for $H(2,2\\)$ is equivalent to H10/$\\\\mathbb{Q}$? Or just that E/IP is equivalent to the undecidability of polynomial equations and inequations over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more of a comment than an answer, since I want to engage only with some of the issues you mention at the very beginning of your post. I believe that you need to take more care in formulating the Equations Problem. \n\nSpecifically, I claim that with your way of describing the equations problem, *every* infinite group has an enumeration for which the EP is not decidable. So this property can depend on the enumeration, even when the group has another presentation with a decidable word problem. This is because we may find an enumeration $g\\_0,g\\_1,g\\_2,\\\\ldots$ of the elements of the group for which the group operation $g\\_ig\\_j\\=g\\_k$ is not decidable (equivalently, the function $(i,j)\\\\mapsto k$ is not computable). To find such an enumeration, we simply diagonalize against the possible programs that might compute the group operation: any given finite partial enumeration can be extended so as to disagree with the next program offered as a candidate for computing the operation. And if we have enumerated the group in such a way that the group operation is not computable, then we cannot decide the corresponding EP, since we cannot decide whether $x^{\\-1}x g\\_ig\\_j\\=g\\_k$ has a solution or not. \n\nThis suggests that you probably want to insist on having a computable presentation of your group, in the sense of computable model theory. So you should only consider enumerations where the group operation is computable. It follows that the inverse operation is also computable, since for any element we can search for the element that multiplies with it to the identify (a fixed parameter of the algorithm)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Equations Problem (EP) for groups, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The EP is always decidable for any infinite group, regardless of the enumeration of its elements.\n\nB) The EP is undecidable for all infinite groups, regardless of the enumeration of its elements.\n\nC) The EP can depend on the enumeration of the group's elements, even for groups with a solvable word problem.\n\nD) The EP is only meaningful for finitely presented groups with a solvable word problem.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the post demonstrates that the decidability of the Equations Problem (EP) can indeed depend on the enumeration of the group's elements, even for groups that have a solvable word problem with a different presentation. \n\nThe post shows that for any infinite group, it's possible to construct an enumeration where the group operation is not computable, making the EP undecidable for that particular enumeration. This is true even if the same group has another presentation with a solvable word problem.\n\nA is incorrect because the post explicitly shows that not every enumeration leads to a decidable EP. B is incorrect because while the EP can be made undecidable for any infinite group with a particular enumeration, it's not necessarily undecidable for all enumerations. D is too restrictive, as the EP can be meaningful for other types of groups as well, though the post suggests that focusing on finitely presented groups with solvable word problems might be a more practical approach.\n\nThe correct formulation of the EP should involve a computable presentation of the group, where the group operation is computable.

Without a minimal working example, it's difficult to say for certain, but if you're using `\\include` then it may be possible that you're using a command like `\\includeonly` to only selectively include chapters. If the excluded files contain commands like `\\gls` they'll be skipped when the file is skipped, which means that they won't be written to the glossary file and no glossary will appear.\n\nHere's an example. The main file `test.tex`:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{report}\n\n\\usepackage{glossaries}\n\n\\makeglossaries\n\n\\loadglsentries{example-glossaries-brief}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch1}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch2}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch3}\n\n\\printglossaries\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nIn the `chapters` directory (folder) the files are:\n\n`test-ch1.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{Sample}\n\n\\gls{lorem}\n\n```\n\n`test-ch2.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{Another}\n\n\\gls{dolor}\n\n```\n\n`test-ch3.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{No Glossary Entries Here}\n\n```\n\nNow the following document build sequence:\n\n```\npdflatex test\nmakeglossaries test\npdflatex test\n\n```\n\nwill correctly generate the glossary. However, suppose I now add\n\n```\n\\includeonly{chapters/test-ch3}\n\n```\n\nto the preamble. This excludes the two chapters that use `\\gls` and only includes the chapter that doesn't contain any `\\gls` (or similar) command. This means that nothing is written to the glossary. Now recompile (rebuild) the document:\n\n```\npdflatex test\nmakeglossaries test\n\n```\n\nThis produces an error message from `makeglossaries`:\n\n```\nmakeglossaries version 2.15 (2014-07-30)\nadded glossary type 'main' (glg,gls,glo)\nWarning: File 'test.glo' is empty.\nHave you used any entries defined in glossary 'main'?\nRemember to use package option 'nomain' if you\ndon't want to use the main glossary.\n\n```\n\nThis is because nothing has been written to `test.glo` because all the commands that perform that write have been skipped.\n\nWhat should you do? Well, if you're excluding chapters, that means you're still working on the document, in which case it doesn't matter. The document is already an incomplete draft since there are some chapters missing, so just skip the `makeglossaries` step until you're ready to check the entire document rather than just the particular chapter you're working on. Once you go back to including the files that contain glossary references, then go back to building the glossary.\n\n**Edit:** Another possibility is that you may be using an old version of `makeglossaries` which didn't pick up `\\@input` from the `.aux` file. This was corrected in `makeglossaries` version 1\\.9 (distributed with `glossaries` v2\\.07 2010/07/10\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a LaTeX document using the glossaries package, why might the glossary fail to appear in the final document despite using \\printglossaries in the main .tex file?\n\nA) The \\makeglossaries command was not used in the preamble\nB) The glossary entries were defined in separate files from the main .tex file\nC) The \\gls commands were placed in chapter files that were excluded using \\includeonly\nD) The \\printglossaries command was placed before the \\begin{document} statement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When using \\includeonly to selectively include chapters, any \\gls commands in excluded chapters are skipped. This means that the glossary information for those entries is not written to the external files, resulting in an empty or incomplete glossary. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the question states that the glossary aspect was good, implying \\makeglossaries was likely used. \n\nOption B is not the cause, as defining glossary entries in separate files is a common and valid practice. \n\nOption D is incorrect because \\printglossaries should be placed within the document environment, not before it, and the question implies it was placed correctly.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how LaTeX builds glossaries and the impact of selective chapter inclusion on glossary compilation."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/592650", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/143253/"], "docs_id": 592650, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have googled for well over an hour, and cannot find and information that simply explains the protocol/concept. Re\\-binding seems to occur several times during the process of [LDAP authentication and authorization](http://thecarlhall.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/ldap-authentication-authorization-dissected-and-digested/). \n\nCan anyone help me understand this concept or share better well explained resources on this...? Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An LDAP client transmits a BIND request to a server in order to change the authorization state of the client connection. When a client first connects to an LDAP directory server, the server sets the authorization state of the connection to `unauthenticated`. When the server receives a BIND request, the server sets the authorization state of the connection to `unauthenticated` immediately. Should the BIND request be successful, the server sets the authorization state of the connection to the state associated with the distinguished\\-name in the BIND request. LDAPv3 allows a connection to change states any number of times, with the caveat that no requests be outstanding when the BIND request is received.\n\nsee also\n========\n\n* [LDAP: Authentication Best Practices](http://web.archive.org/web/20130801091446/http://www.ldapguru.info/ldap/authentication-best-practices.html)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LDAP documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of LDAP authentication, which of the following statements best describes the process of re-binding?\n\nA) Re-binding is the process of repeatedly authenticating a user to increase security.\nB) Re-binding occurs when a client changes its authorization state by sending a new BIND request to the server.\nC) Re-binding is a method to reset the connection to an unauthenticated state after each request.\nD) Re-binding is the process of connecting to multiple LDAP servers simultaneously for load balancing.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Re-binding in LDAP refers to the process where a client changes its authorization state by sending a new BIND request to the server. This is accurately described in option B. The LDAP protocol allows a connection to change states multiple times, as long as there are no outstanding requests when the new BIND request is received. \n\nOption A is incorrect because re-binding is not about repeatedly authenticating for increased security. Option C is incorrect because while a BIND request initially sets the state to unauthenticated, it doesn't reset after each request. Option D is incorrect as re-binding is not related to load balancing or connecting to multiple servers."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/14", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/150212", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/42297/"], "docs_id": 150212, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I'm on Checkout Page.

Setting 'secure: false' in the Nodemailer configuration allows it to use STARTTLS instead of SSL, which can resolve the \"unknown protocol\" error. This change doesn't compromise security but rather uses a more modern and flexible encryption method.\n\nC) While enabling STARTTLS in Postfix can be beneficial, the error is occurring on the Nodemailer side, so changing the Postfix configuration alone wouldn't solve this specific issue.\n\nD) Updating OpenSSL might help in some cases, but it's not the most direct or likely solution to this specific error, which is more related to how Nodemailer is configured to connect to the mail server.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the 'secure: true' option in Nodemailer forces it to use older SSL methods, which can cause compatibility issues. Changing it to false allows for the use of STARTTLS, which is more widely supported and can resolve the connection error while maintaining security."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/33026", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1646/"], "docs_id": 33026, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to configure my router so I can access the website I have running on my computer from the outside world.\n\nHow can I do this?

Port 80 is the standard port for HTTP traffic, which is what most basic websites use.\n3.

Just copy config/application.properties along with your other deployment artifact(s) to your deployment location.\n3. Use a shared config file in your multi\\-module project. As far as I know, Quarkus only supports one instance each of application.properties, microprofile\\-config.properties, and application.yaml. You could store application properties in any one of them and the shared properties in one of the remaining two property files that is copied in during a build. Yuck, I know, and I've never tried it :\\-) I don't think you can point to a config file outside of the project directory, except for \\#2 exception above.

Using a shared service like Consul or Vault with the appropriate Quarkus extension offers several advantages:\n\n1. Centralization: It provides a single source of truth for configuration, making it easier to manage and update across all applications.\n2. Scalability: As the project grows, a shared service can easily accommodate new modules or applications without requiring changes to individual deployment processes.\n3. Runtime updates: Many of these services support dynamic configuration updates, allowing changes without redeploying applications.\n4. Security: Services like Vault offer built-in security features for sensitive configuration data.\n5. Integration: Quarkus provides extensions for these services, making implementation straightforward.\n\nOption A, while simpler, doesn't scale well for larger projects and lacks the flexibility of a dedicated configuration service.

This allows you to engage them one at a time, preventing them from surrounding you. By circling and creating distance, you can manage the fight more effectively, attacking a few times before moving again to avoid being overwhelmed.

To be clear, it is my MacBooks storage space that gets filled up when I plug it in, since this happens every time I can't use the drive on my Macbook anymore either, because every time I can only use it a few minutes before I get warned that \"My macbook is almost out of storage space, please remove some files\".

The wheel (blue torus) will continue spinning about its axis with angular velocity \u03c9.\n2. The astronaut (orange cylinder) will begin spinning in the opposite direction with a different angular velocity \u03c9' to conserve angular momentum.\n3.

I've started remodeling and in tearing out my kitchen I discovered the wall between me and my neighbors is only that: a wall. No fire protection just drywall, regular (old) insulation and drywall. Any simple suggestions besides tearing down all the drywall?\n\nI'll be installing Roxul Safe'n'Sound\u2122 in the interior walls. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Type X drywall, which is typically 5/8\" thick (as opposed to 1/2\") and contains fiberglass within the gypsum is typically used for fire protection. I believe it increases the burn through time to around 1 hour, and it increases the impact resistance (there's often falling debris in a fire). For further protection, every electrical junction box should be enclosed around the back, top, and bottom with 2x4's and plywood to prevent fires from burning through the box, or a fire that starts in the box from spreading quickly to the other side. Additionally, every penetration in the wall should be sealed with fire rated caulking (it's typically orange in color, and they also have a similar expanding foam of the same color, so it's easy for the building inspector to verify you used the correct product).\n\nThe safe and sound insulation is a great addition. The only other thing you could do is to add a 1\" air gap and a second wall on your side, which would help with both the spread of fire and sound, but the downside is that you'd lose almost 6\" of space in your kitchen.\n\nRealize that no structure will be fire proof, the goal is to slow the spread until the fire department can get there.

Type X drywall is specifically designed for fire resistance, offering about 1 hour of burn-through time. Sealing penetrations with fire-rated caulking prevents fire from spreading through openings in the wall. Roxul Safe'n'Sound\u2122 insulation adds an extra layer of fire protection and sound insulation.

There are two options:\n\n* Install a fully functional local TeX system. For that the obvious candidates would be MiKTeX, MacTeX, or TeXlive, and in terms of ease of installation for most students either MiKTeX (Windows) or MacTeX (OSX). (Linux users would probably want TeXlive, and may need to be warned about the tendency for distribution packages to be considerably out of date.)\n* Use a cloud\\-based system, of which the most commonly used is now [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)\n\nAlthough there are pros and cons to all these choices, there is a lot to be said for beginners in using a cloud\\-based approach in terms of your criteria. It offers a straightforward LaTeX compiler and editor, with nothing to install, and it works pretty intuitively. It's free for personal use. It's \"real LaTeX\" and mostly any document that compiles there will compile on other systems in the same way. There are good reasons for experienced users to prefer to maintain a local system and their are occasional disadvantages to being in the cloud: but as a way to get going quickly without installing anything, it may have much to say for it.\n\nTo my mind the main **practical** downsides are (1\\) occasionally the cloud\\-based systems lag behind bleeding edge TeX development (but that is unlikely to be a problem for most users) and (2\\) Overleaf seems to encourage the use of non\\-standard \"templates\", some of which are of dubious quality or utility, and which may not be portable. But (1\\) is unlikely to bite new users, mostly, and (2\\) can be avoided by encouraging people to use **Standard** templates.\n\nThere are obviously more principled reasons why people might refuse to use cloud\\-based systems and circumstances (e.g. confidentiality concerns) in which they would not be appropriate. But if your students are not handling sensitive personal data, or commercial or government secrets, and do not have rooted objections to the use of anything in the cloud, those do not seem to be deal killers. Some might have other personal views (for instance preferring to use a particular editor).\n\nIn the long run, if someone is going to use LaTeX a lot, there are very sound reasons to move away from such systems to something more controllable. At that point the sort of information provided [at the LaTeX project page](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and [by TUG](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free) is useful.\n\nArguably as important (and here again the cloud based systems tend to help) is encouraging users to use modern practices (such as UTF encoding) and packages from the start."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A professor wants to introduce LaTeX to their students for a technical writing course.

If I look at the cartesian values, `x`, `y` and `z` are of order `1e6`, `1e6` and `1e2` for the GCRS frame, but they are of order `1e20`, `1e10` and `1e17`, respectively, for the Galactic frame. \n\nGiven a precision of `1e-15` for 8 byte floating point numbers (`numpy.finfo('f8').eps`), that means the `x`\\-value of the Galactic coordinate can only be precise to about `1e5` (meters). Then taking the norm (with the `x`\\-value uncertainty dominating), would lead to an accuracy of order `1e5` meters as well, much more than the actual separation.\n\nThe fact that the calculated values are still close to each other is largely luck (though it'll have an underlying reason, such as deviations averaging out somewhat). \n\nThis also agrees with the fact that you don't see a problem (or less of a problem) for larger offsets. Though testing it myself, I still see difference, of order `1e4`\\~`1e5`). To be precise, using 0 and 10 latitude, I obtain:\n\n```\nGCRS:     1104451.74511518\nGalactic: 1108541.8206286128\n\n```\n\nIf my assumption is correct, then my advice is simple: use the appropriate coordinate system for your coordinates, and take into account the relevant uncertainties (both machine precision and that of the coordinate system used)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is experiencing an error with Scrollspy on a webpage that includes both internal section links and an external link. The error message states: \"Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: https://example.com/page2\". What is the most likely cause of this error and the best solution to implement?\n\nA) The Scrollspy initialization is incorrect. The developer should modify the offset value in the Scrollspy initialization to fix the error.\n\nB) The external link is being misinterpreted by Scrollspy. The developer should add a class to the external link and modify the Scrollspy initialization to ignore elements with this class.\n\nC) The smooth scrolling function is conflicting with Scrollspy. The developer should remove the smooth scrolling function to resolve the error.\n\nD) The error is caused by a floating point precision problem. The developer should convert all coordinates to a different coordinate system to fix the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The error is occurring because Scrollspy is trying to interpret the external link (https://example.com/page2) as an internal page section, which it cannot recognize. The best solution is to add a class to the external link (e.g., \"external-link\") and modify the Scrollspy initialization to ignore elements with this class. This allows Scrollspy to function correctly for internal links while ignoring the external link that's causing the error.\n\nOption A is incorrect because changing the offset won't address the fundamental issue of Scrollspy misinterpreting the external link.

For example, we start with supposing $z\\_1\\=z\\_2\\=z\\_3\\=z\\_4\\=z\\_5\\=0$, then first deduce $z\\_6\\=0$ and $z\\_9\\=0$ and next $z\\_7\\=0$ and $z\\_8\\=0$. If it can be shown that with any initial assignment of zeros satisfying (i)\\-(iii) we will succesfully deduce all the $z\\_k$'s are zero, then the answer for $m\\=10$ is true. This may hopefully lead to a more efficient algorithm for our system than using Groebner basis method. \n\n**Edit:** My attempt to this problem illustrated earlier is in fact considering if there exist $\\\\emptyset\\\\neq N\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the following three conditions.\n\n(I) $(N\\+\\\\frac{m}{2})\\\\cap N\\=\\\\emptyset$;\n\n(II) $(\\-N)\\\\cap N\\=\\\\emptyset$;\n\n(III) for each $k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$, $(2k\\-N)\\\\cap N\\\\neq\\\\{k\\\\}$.\n\nIf there does not exist such nonempty $N$ for some fixed $m$, then the polynomial system is zero\\-dimensional for this $m$.\n\nIn order to show that if the above mentioned $N$ does not exist then $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ for the corresponding $m$, we suppose $V$ contains a nonzero point $z\\=(z\\_0,z\\_1,\\\\dots,z\\_{m\\-1})$ and let $N\\_1$ consist of all the indices $s$ (modulo $m$) with $z\\_s\\\\neq0$. It is easy to see that $N\\_1$ satisfies (I), because $z\\_s$ and $z\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}}$ cannot be nonzero simultaneously for any $s$ since $z\\_sz\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}\\+s}\\=0$. Similarly, $N\\_1$ satisfies (II). To show (III) for $N\\_1$, assume on the contrary that $(2k\\-N\\_1\\)\\\\cap N\\_1\\=\\\\{k\\\\}$ for some $k$. Then $z\\_k\\\\neq0$ and so $z\\_{\\\\frac{m}{2}\\+k}\\=0$. Moreover, for any $j\\\\neq k$, $j\\\\not\\\\in(2k\\-N\\_1\\)\\\\cap N\\_1$. Hence $2k\\-j\\\\not\\\\in N\\_1$ or $j\\\\not\\\\in N\\_1$, which is to say, $z\\_{2k\\-j}\\=0$ or $z\\_j\\=0$. So $z\\_jz\\_{2k\\-j}\\=0$ for any $j\\\\neq k$, contradicting $\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{s\\=0}^{m\\-1}z\\_sz\\_{2k\\-s}\\=0$.\n\n**Edit after two answers have been posted:** Will Sawin's answer saves me from going in the previous edited way. Lev Borisov wrote $f\\_t$ into product of two linear factors and then suggested showing all the possible linear systems are zero\\-dimensional. I tried to follow Lev Borisov's way, but still see no light. (If anyone knows how to probably do it, point out for me please.) However, I figured out how to show the system is zero\\-dimensional for $m\\=10,12,14$. I will upgrade here my study progress to this problem.\n\nHereafter, I will use the mod $m$ indices. The following observations will be useful.\n\n**Claim 1:** Let $a\\\\in(\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times$. If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$, then $(x\\_0,x\\_a,\\\\dots,x\\_{a(m\\-1\\)})$ and $(x\\_{m/2},x\\_{1\\+m/2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1\\+m/2})$ are both in $V$.\n\nIn light of Claim 1, define maps $\\\\phi\\_a$ and $\\\\psi\\_a$ on $\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z}$ for each $a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times$ by\n$$\n\\\\phi\\_a(x):x\\\\mapsto ax\\+m(1\\+\\\\rho(a))/4,\\\\quad\\\\psi\\_a(x):x\\\\mapsto ax\\+m(1\\-\\\\rho(a))/4,\n$$\nwhere $\\\\rho$ is the Jacobi symbol mod $m$. Then all the $\\\\phi\\_a$ and $\\\\psi\\_a$ form an abelian group $G$ of order $2\\\\varphi(m)$, and all the $\\\\phi\\_a$ form a subgroup $H$ of order $\\\\varphi(m)$. Let $G$ act on $\\\\mathbb{C}\\[z\\_0,\\\\dots,z\\_{m\\-1}]$ by action on the indices of $z\\_k$'s. \n\n**Claim 2:** If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$ satisfies $x\\_2\\=x\\_4\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-2}\\=0$, then $x\\_1\\=x\\_3\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-1}\\=0$.\n\nClaim 2 follows from the convolution formula of discrete Fourier transform on $(x\\_1,x\\_3,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})$. Similarly we have\n\n**Claim 3:** If $(x\\_0,x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_{m\\-1})\\\\in V$ satisfies $x\\_1\\=x\\_3\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-1}\\=0$, then $x\\_2\\=x\\_4\\=\\\\dots\\=x\\_{m\\-2}\\=0$.\n\n**Case $m\\=10$:** Multiply $z\\_1$ on both sides of $f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3\\+2z\\_1z\\_4z\\_8\\=0$. Further multiply $z\\_3$ on both sides gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$. Hence by Claim 1, $z\\_8z\\_4\\=\\\\phi\\_3(z\\_1z\\_3\\)\\=0$. This leads to $z\\_1^3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1\\=0$. Therefore, $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ by Claim 1 since $G$ acts transitively on $\\\\mathbb{Z}/10\\\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Case $m\\=12$:** $z\\_1z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, which is equivalent to $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$.

Therefore, $z\\_4\\=z\\_{10}\\=0$ by Claim 1, and so $V\\=\\\\{0\\\\}$ by Claim 2\\.\n\n**Case $m\\=14$:** $z\\_1z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\+2z\\_1z\\_3z\\_4z\\_{12}\\=0$, and $z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3f\\_1\\=0$ gives $z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3\\=0$. The latter implies $z\\_4z\\_1z\\_{12}\\=\\\\psi\\_{11}(z\\_1z\\_2z\\_3\\)\\=0$ by Claim 1, which leads to $z\\_1^3z\\_3\\=0$, i.e. $z\\_1z\\_3\\=0$.

Will reading from 2 disks be faster than 1? And the obvious answer is yes. If one disk is only capable of reading 100MBps, two disks naturally can read at 200MBps. And that's why the theoretical read speed of raid 0 is n, where n is the number of disks in the array. The same goes for raid 1 with reads. There are n number of disks and you can read from all of them at the same time for greater speed.\n\nHowever, raid 0 is faster than raid 1 because there's not only reads but also writes. Raid 0 is striped, so only half the data is in one disk and the other half on the other disk. Raid 1 is cloned, so the data is on both sides. This means that when you write, you need to write to both disks of all the data in raid 1\\. So, the write speed in raid 0 is again n, here n is the number of disks in the array versus raid 1, where the write speed is always 1; same as writing to non\\-raid disk.\n\nAlso touching on the original question's misconception. You don't scan the disk to find the file's data, ever. Files have pointers which point to a block in the drive of where that file is stored in. Once you have the file in question, you fetch the data from that position and retrieve the relevant information from that block.\n\nI suggest you read more about it in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) about RAID.\n\nAlso, you can try playing around with raid calculator to see theoretical read/write speeds in [wolfram alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=raid)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about RAID 0 is correct?\n\nA) RAID 0 scans the entire array for every read request, making it slower than a single disk.\n\nB) RAID 0 offers improved read performance but write speeds remain the same as a single disk.\n\nC) RAID 0 provides both improved read and write performance compared to a single disk.\n\nD) RAID 0 is slower than RAID 1 for both read and write operations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: RAID 0 offers improved performance for both read and write operations compared to a single disk. It achieves this by striping data across multiple disks, allowing parallel access. The theoretical read and write speeds of RAID 0 are n times that of a single disk, where n is the number of disks in the array. This is because data is split and stored across different drives, enabling simultaneous access. The misconception about scanning the whole array for every read request is addressed in the documentation - files have pointers to specific blocks, so the system doesn't need to scan the entire array to find data. RAID 0 is faster than RAID 1 for writes, as RAID 1 requires writing the same data to multiple disks for redundancy."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/31", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/277867", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/102327/"], "docs_id": 277867, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In F3 Framework Controller I wrote a function checking whether MySql data are saved in a file, otherwise loading a form to ask users for that data (similar to Wordpress Installation).\n\nThis function is loaded **every time** that a page / method is called:\n\n```\nabstract class Controller\n{\n\n    /* F3 */\n    protected $f3;\n    protected $file_configuration = 'setup.cfg';\n\n    function __construct()\n    {\n        $f3 = Base::instance();\n        $this->f3 = $f3;\n        $this->setDatabase();\n        $this->setup();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nand `setDatabase()` is a simple:\n\n```\nprivate function setDatabase()\n    {\n        $search = 'TEST';\n        $file = $this->file_configuration;\n        // Read from file\n        $lines = file('app/config/'.$file);\n        $found = false;\n        foreach($lines as $line)\n        {\n            // Check if the line contains the string we're looking for, and print if it does\n            if(strpos($line, $search) !== false)\n            {\n                $found = true;\n            }\n        }\n        if ($found===false)\n        {\n            $fh = fopen('app/config/'.$file, 'a') or die(\"can't open file\");\n            $stringData = \"\\n\";\n            fwrite($fh, $stringData);\n            $stringData = \"New Stuff 1\";\n            fwrite($fh, $stringData);\n            $stringData = \"\\n\";\n            fwrite($fh, $stringData);\n            $stringData = \"New Stuff 2\";\n            fwrite($fh, $stringData);\n            fclose($fh);\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n(Please don't see the values of variables... only test at the moment) ;\\-)\n\nMy question is: \n\nOthers classes start extending Controller, will I put too much strain on my server reading every time the file?\n\nCan you hint me a best approach?\n\nImagine wordpress: I think that every time you call the page, it checks if database exists / is properly configured, otherwise stop / ask for insert connection data (username, password, etc)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could be (too) heavy for my server performs that check every time?\n\nThis is just not good practice in general.

What are the arguments for and against the existence of a bug\\-free system?\n\nBecause there is some notion that every fix you make creates more bugs, but I don't think that's true.\n\nBy bugs I meant from the simplest typos in the UI, to more serious preventative bugs that has no workaround. For example a particular scripting function calculates normals incorrectly. Also even when there are workarounds, the problem still has to be fixed. So you could say you can do this particular thing manually instead of using the provided function but that function still has to be fixed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As Mikey mentioned, writing bugless code is not the goal. If that is what you are aiming for, then I have some very bad news for you.\n\nThe key point is that you are vastly underestimating the complexity of software.\n\nFirst things first\\-\\-You're ignoring the bigger picture of how your program runs. It does not run in isolation on a perfect system. Even the most basic of \"Hello World\" programs runs on an operating system, and therefore, even the most simple of programs is susceptible to bugs that may exist in the operating system.\n\nThe existence of libraries makes this more complex. While operating systems tend to be fairly stable, libraries are a mixed bag when it comes to stability. Some are wonderful. Others ... not so much ... If you want your code to be 100% bug free, then you will need to also ensure that every library you run against is completely bug free, and many times this simply isn't possible as you may not have the source code.\n\nThen there are threads to think about. Most large scale programs use threads all over the place. We try to be careful and write threads in such a way where race conditions and deadlock do not occur, but it simply is not possible to test every possible combination of code. In order to test this effectively, you would need to examine every possible ordering of commands going through the CPU. I have not done the math on this one, but I suspect that enumerating all of the possible games of Chess would be easier.\n\nThings go from hard to impossible when we look at the machine itself. CPU's are not perfect. RAM is not perfect. Hard drives are not perfect. None of the components within a machine are designed to be perfect\\-\\-they're designed to be \"good enough\". Even a perfect program will eventually fail due to a hiccup by the machine. There's nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nBottom line: Can you write \"Bug free software\"?\n\nNO\n==\n\nAnyone who tells you otherwise is clueless.\n\nJust try to write software that is easy to understand and maintain. Once you've done that, you can call it a day.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Some people commented about an excellent point that I had completely overlooked: the compiler.\n\nUnless you are writing in assembly, it is entirely possible that the compiler will mess up your code (even if you prove that your code is \"perfect\").\n\nA list of bugs in GCC, one of the more commonly used compilers: [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product\\=gcc\\&component\\=c%2B%2B\\&resolution\\=\\-\\-\\-](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=gcc&component=c%2B%2B&resolution=---)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the possibility of creating completely bug-free software for a large-scale application with millions of lines of code?\n\nA) It is possible to create bug-free software if given enough time and resources to fix all issues.\n\nB) Bug-free software is achievable by focusing solely on the application's codebase and ignoring external factors.\n\nC) Creating bug-free software is impossible due to various factors beyond the control of the developers.\n\nD) Bug-free software can be guaranteed by using perfect hardware components and a flawless operating system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because creating truly bug-free software is impossible due to various factors beyond the control of developers. These factors include:\n\n1. Dependencies on potentially buggy operating systems and libraries\n2. Complexity of multi-threaded applications and inability to test all possible scenarios\n3. Imperfections in hardware components like CPUs, RAM, and hard drives\n4. Potential compiler errors, even with perfect source code\n5.

For instance, I can define successor as the minimal cardinal greater than the given cardinal. \n\nObviously, I need to make some assumptions as to the basic cardinal arithmetics, so that it looks like the standard one in $ZFC$ \\+ (possibly) generalized continuum hypothesis. \n\nNow, assuming one has done all of the above, it appears that the \"small\" large cardinals, such as weak inaccessible, Mahlo, etc are definable in this theory (even in standard presentations, such as Drake, their definition is arithmetic ). \n\nBut what about the others, the heavy\\-weight ones? Do I necessarily have to resort to the ambient set theory ( stationary points, elementary embeddings, etc ) to talk about very large cardinals, or there is always a direct (algebraic/arithmetical/topological) way to provide their definition? \n\nPrima facie, it looks like the answer is no, but maybe there is a clever path to answer in the affirmative. Or perhaps, there is some kind of intrinsic boundary, beyond which you need to think of cardinals within the context of set theory\n\nAny thought, refs, or known fact? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most of the large cardinals have a variety of equivalent\nformulations in ZFC, and some of them are characterized by long\nlists of diverse equivalent properties. For a few examples, take a\nlook at the [Cantor's Attic](http://cantorsattic.info) entries for [weakly compact](http://cantorsattic.info/Weakly_compact),\n[strongly compact](http://cantorsattic.info/Strongly_compact) and [weakly measurable](http://cantorsattic.info/Weakly_measurable) cardinals.\n\nThere is a phenomenon, however, that in weaker set theories such\nas ZF some of these characterizations are no longer equivalent.\nFor example, one cannot expect to prove the embedding\ncharacterization of measurable cardinals from the ultrafilter\ncharacterization in ZF, since one needs the axiom of choice in\norder to establish the Los theorem on ultrapowers. A similar situation arises with most all of the larger large cardinals. There has been some work understanding the various large cardinals in ZF worlds, for example, under the axiom of determinacy, which implies that many successor cardinals including $\\\\omega\\_1$ are measurable according to the ultrafilter definition. \n\nSecondly, most of the largest large cardinals are defined by second order\nproperties, such as the existence of proper class objects, often\nembeddings of a particular kind. These definitions cannot be made\nin ZFC, which has no capacity for second\\-order quantifiers, but\nrather are usually made in G\u00f6del\\-Bernays set theory or\nKelly\\-Morse set theory. It turns out, however, that these\nsecond\\-order definitions in every case (except [Reinhardt\ncardinals](http://cantorsattic.info/Reinhardt#Reinhardt_cardinal)) have a first\\-order equivalent. For example, a cardinal $\\\\kappa$ is measurable if and only if\n(second\\-order) it is the critical point of an elementary embedding\n$j:V\\\\to M$, if and only if (first\\-order) there is a\n$\\\\kappa$\\-complete ultrafilter on $\\\\kappa$. These equivalences are\nnot provable in ZFC, and not even statable in ZFC, but are proved\nin GBC.\n\nMeanwhile, the theory $\\\\text{ZFC}^\\-$, meaning ZFC without the\npower set axiom (see my paper, [What is the theory of ZFC without\npower set axiom?](http://jdh.hamkins.org/what-is-the-theory-zfc-without-power-set/) for some subtleties about how to axiomatize\nthis theory properly) is sufficient to formalize the basic\nproperties of those large cardinals with a $\\\\Sigma\\_2$ definition,\nsuch as inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly compact, measurable,\nsuperstrong, Woodin and huge cardinals, whose existence is\nabsolute between $H\\_\\\\delta$ and $V$. Meanwhile, notions such as\ntall, strong and supercompact cardinals involve another quantifier\nthrough all the ordinals, which makes them not usually absolute\nbetween $H\\_\\\\delta$ and $V$.\n\nAlthough you seem to object to the embedding characterization of\nlarge cardinals, I would say that it is the embedding\ncharacterizations that have proved the most fruitful in their use\nand analysis. It is surely the embedding outlook that unifies an\nenormous part of the theory."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about large cardinal axioms is NOT correct?\n\nA) Most large cardinals have multiple equivalent formulations in ZFC, but these equivalences may not hold in weaker set theories like ZF.\n\nB) The largest large cardinals are typically defined using second-order properties, but these usually have first-order equivalents.\n\nC) The theory ZFC- (ZFC without the power set axiom) is sufficient to formalize the basic properties of all large cardinals, including those with higher-order definitions.\n\nD) The embedding characterizations of large cardinals have proven to be particularly fruitful in the development and analysis of large cardinal theory.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is correct: The text mentions that in weaker set theories like ZF, some characterizations of large cardinals that are equivalent in ZFC may no longer be equivalent.\n\nB is correct: The passage states that most of the largest large cardinals are defined by second-order properties, but \"these second-order definitions in every case (except Reinhardt cardinals) have a first-order equivalent.\"\n\nC is incorrect: ZFC- is only sufficient to formalize the basic properties of large cardinals with a \u03a32 definition, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly compact, measurable, superstrong, Woodin, and huge cardinals.
