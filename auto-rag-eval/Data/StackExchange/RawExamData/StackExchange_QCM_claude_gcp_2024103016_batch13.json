The software needs to run in a user context, so there is a domain account created for each of these desktops. They are left logged in all the time with the screen locked.\n\nThe software also has a reporting feature built in, so every few days a staff member logs into that computer to perform a report, then sends it to a manager. Because the person who regularly does this is sometimes away, there are actually about three people that need to know the password to log into this machine.\n\nThere are several problems I would like to address:\n\n* If the computer is restarted, I need to manually log\\-in all the accounts.\n* Users can barely remember one good password, let alone two.\n* Best practice dictates a 1\\-1 mapping between people and accounts for auditing purposes.\n\nHave you encountered any software like this, and if so, how have you dealt with it? The only idea I've been able to come up with is finding better software. I'd like to avoid that route if possible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For starters you should try to run the application as a service, so that you don't need to have the machines logged into all the time. I'm sure this is not possible with the software itself but you can use a number of methods to get around that. I generally use [srvany](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137890). This will also solve the problem of starting th esoftware after a reboot.\n\nQuite often the reporting software can be installed and run on a separate machine, so that's worth investigating as well. Ideally the machine(s) running the monitoring software would reside in a server room or other secure area, therby eliminating most of your issues. Beyond that you can use normal file and folder permissions to limit who can get to the software. Then the permissions can be adjusted to grant access as and when necessary."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is facing challenges with their call monitoring software that runs on desktop computers.

Running the application as a service eliminates the need for manual login after restarts.\n2. It removes the need for users to remember additional passwords for the monitoring software.\n3. Using file and folder permissions allows for proper access control without compromising individual user accounts.\n4. This approach doesn't require changing the existing software, which was a preference mentioned in the original question.\n\nOption A doesn't solve the restart issue and still requires manual logins. Option B violates the best practice of 1-1 mapping between people and accounts.

There are a couple of ways you can do it:\n\n* Raster Calculator \\- simply use the raster calculator and you can set the resolution and extent there and can make them match another raster by selecting the raster band you want to match in the Raster Bands list and then clicking the \"Current layer extent\" button. The columns and rows fields will let you set the resolution. However, this method gives you no control over the resampling method.\n* Using [GDAL\\_Warp](http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html) \\- this tool lets you set the output resolution either by specifying the width and height of the output raster or by specifying the \\-tr switch (see the documentation). You can get to the GDAL\\_warp tool by going Raster\\-\\>Projections\\-\\>Warp (I did say it wasn't obvious from a resampling point of view!). \n\n\t+ (v2\\.x) If you want to use the \\-tr switch, fill in all the boxes for input raster and output etc (your source and target SRS values will presumably be the same in this case \\- though don't have to be if you're reprojecting as well). Then click the little pencil icon at the bottom and edit the auto\\-generated gdal\\-warp commandline to include your \\-tr switch. Gdal\\_wrap lets you specif the algorithm you want to use for the resampling and so is a little less of a blunt instrument than using the raster calculator.\n\t+ (v3\\.x) The \\-tr switch is enabled by using the *Output file resolution in target georeferenced units* box. For example, to downsample a 1m DEM to a 2m DEM, you can enter 2 in that field. However, there is no option to pass two different arguments for non\\-square pixels. Say your target pixel size is `0.3125,0.25`, meaning the `xres` is `0.3125` and the `yres` is `0.25`. If you now pass the value `0.3125` in that box, it will set `-tr 0.3125 0.3125` in the command. To counter this limitation, simply copy the code, paste to the command line, edit the \\-tr flag and run. For example: \n\n\t`gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 -tr 0.3125 0.25 -r near -te 71.40625 24.875 84.21875 34.375 -te_srs EPSG:4326 -of GTiff foo.tiff bar.tiff`\n\n\t(depending on your instalation and environment variables, you may also need to explicitly state the path to gdalwarp)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to resample two geotiff images to the same resolution in QGIS.

If a fiber over a closed point of $Y$ is reduced is the generic fiber reduced?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's impose a flatness hypothesis (whose necessity is explained in Jason Starr's answer). The answer is still negative, but to explain the context for the counterexample it is instructive to first record some necessary features of any counterexample, so we know where to look.\n\nIn view of my above comment about geometric fibers, any search for a counterexample will necessarily have to involve a special fiber that is reduced yet not geometrically reduced. In other words, any counterexample will have to involve an imperfect residue field at the special point in the base. \n\nMoreover, the answer is affirmative if the base $Y$ is Dedekind. Indeed, we can assume in such a case that the base $Y$ is Spec($R$) for a dvr $R$ with uniformizer $t$, so $X$ is a proper flat $R$\\-scheme having reduced special fiber $X\\_0$. If $N$ is the coherent sheaf of nilpotents inside $O\\_X$ then for any section $f \\\\in N(U)$ over an open $U \\\\subset X$ we know that $f\\_0 \\= f\\|\\_{U\\_0}$ vanishes since $X\\_0$ is reduced, so $f$ is a section of $tO\\_X$. In other words, $N \\\\subset tO\\_X$. By $R$\\-flatness of $X$, it is clear (check!) that $N \\\\cap tO\\_X \\= tN$, so $N \\\\subset tN$. Hence, by Nakayama's Lemma along points of the special fiber, it follows that $N$ has vanishing stalks along the special fiber $X\\_0 \\\\subset X$. The closed support of the coherent $N$ inside the $R$\\-proper $X$ is therefore disjoint from the special fiber. But every non\\-empty closed set in $X$ must meet $X\\_0$ due to $R$\\-properness of $X$ and locality of $R$. Thus, the support is empty, which is to say $N \\= 0$. Then $X$ is reduced, so its localization given by the generic fiber over the integral base $Y$ is also reduced. That settles the question affirmatively when $Y$ is Dedekind (and $X$ is any proper flat $Y$\\-scheme).\n\nIn view of the preceding observations, an \"optimal\" counterexample should involve a local base $Y \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(R)$ where $R$ is a non\\-Dedekind 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain having imperfect residue field with characteristic $p \\> 0$. And in fact there *are* counterexamples over such $R$, as we now construct. This shows that the EGA result with reducedness for *geometric* fibers is essentially \"best possible\". We will give counterexamples in equicharacteristic $p$. Maybe someone else can address the story with generic characteristic 0\\. (**SEE THE END FOR SUCH AN EXAMPLE**)\n\nThe idea is to make such an $R$ that is an order in a dvr of characteristic $p$ whose fraction field contains a certain $p$th root but for which $R$ does not contain that $p$th root. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p \\> 0$ and let $A \\= k(t)\\[x]\\_{(x)}$, a dvr with uniformizer $x$ and residue field $k(t)$ that is obviously not perfect. Let $F \\= {\\\\rm{Frac}}(A) \\= k(t,x)$ and let $A' \\= A\\[T]/(T^p \\- t) \\= k(T)\\[x]\\_{(x)}$, so the dvr $A'$ with uniformizer $x$ is the integral closure of $A$ in $F' \\= F\\[T]/(T^p \\- t) \\= F(t^{1/p})$. Note that $A \\\\rightarrow A'$ is an example of a finite extension of discrete valuation ring whose ramification degree is 1 but residual extension is not separable (so it is not \"unramified\").\n\nThe residue field of $A'$ is $k(T)$ in which the element $t$ from the residue field of $A$ has image $T^p$ that *is* a $p$th power, but we can \"fix\" that (or rather, \"ruin\" it) by considering the order\n$R \\= A \\+ xA'$. Concretely, $R$ is the preimage of $k(t)$ under the reduction map $A' \\\\twoheadrightarrow k(T)$.\n\nClearly $R$ is a 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain whose fraction field is $F'$, residue field is $k(t)$, and normalization is $A'$. Note that the element $T \\= t^{1/p}$ in the fraction field $F'$ of $R$ does *not* lie in $R$. \n\nInside $\\\\mathbf{P}^2\\_A$ with homogeneous coordinates $\\[U,V,W]$, consider the closed subscheme $Z$ defined by $U^p \\+ t V^p$. This is $A$\\-flat since $A$ is Dedekind. Its special and generic fibers are the \"same\" projective scheme over the residue field $k(t)$ and fraction field $k(t,x)$ respectively, and as such these fibers are both *reduced* (as $t$ is not a $p$th power in either the residue field or fraction field of $A$, each of characteristic $p$) and are also both geometrically irreducible. The base change\n$X \\= Z\\_R$ is certainly $R$\\-flat (since $Z$ is $A$\\-flat) and projective with special fiber that is the *same* as that of $Z$ since $R$ and $A$ have the same residue field by design. In particular, $X\\_0$ is reduced (though not geometrically so!). The generic fiber $X\\_{F'} \\= Z\\_{F'}$ is non\\-reduced since $t$ is a $p$th power in $F'$. Note however that the $R$\\-flat $X$ has irreducible generic fiber, so $X$ is also irreducible. Voila.\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**:\nHere is an even better example in the same spirit, but with a twist on the idea so that it works in generic characteristic 0\\. It will use an order in \n$\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[T]\\_{(p)}$ as I had been hoping. This example was pointed out to me by somebody \"offline\". \n\nLet $A \\= \\\\mathbf{Z}\\[t]\\_{(p)}$, a dvr with uniformizer $p$, residue field $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$, and fraction field $F \\= \\\\mathbf{Q}(t)$. Let $A'\\= \\\\mathbf{Z}\\[T]\\_{(p)}$ made into an $A$\\-algebra via $t \\\\mapsto T^p$, so its fraction field $F'$ is $F(t^{1/p})$.\nLet $R \\= A \\+ pA'$, a 1\\-dimensional local noetherian domain with residue field $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$ and fraction field $F'$.\n\nConsider the polynomial $f(U,V) \\= (U \\+ T V)^p \\\\in U^p \\+ t V^p \\+ pA'\\[U,V]\n\\\\subset R\\[U,V]$.\nObviously $f$ is a $p$th power over $F' \\= \\\\mathbf{Q}(T)$, but it is *not* a (unit multiple of a) $p$th power over $R$ since the reduction of $f$ over the residue field of $R$ is $U^p \\+ t V^p \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)\\[U,V]$, which is even irreducible. \n\nLet $X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{P}^1\\_R$ be defined by the vanishing of the homogeneous $f$. \n(The equicharacteristic\\-$p$ example above ought to have been considered inside $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$ just as well; I mistakenly thought being in $\\\\mathbf{P}^2$ would provide better irreducibility properties, but those hold already with $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$.) \nThe $R$\\-scheme is $R$\\-flat because each of $U^p$ and $V^p$ have coefficients that are units in $R$ (ensuring that after dehomogenization, the coordinate ring of the affine open chart of $X$ is a finite free $R$\\-module). In fact, we see that $X$ is finite flat over $R$, with degree $p$.\n\nThe special fiber of $X$ is the zero scheme of $U^p \\+ t V^p$ in $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$ over $\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p(t)$, and this is visibly reduced. On the other hand, the generic fiber is $(U\\+TV)^p\\=0$ in $\\\\mathbf{P}^1\\_{F'}$, and this is visibly not reduced (but is irreducible, and likewise $X$ is irreducible; in fact, $X\\_{\\\\rm{red}} \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(R)$!)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let f : X \u2192 Y be a projective morphism between irreducible Noetherian schemes, where Y = Spec(R) and R is a 1-dimensional local Noetherian domain.

FROM [Table]\nWHERE \n  (@optionalParam1 IS NULL OR MyColumn1 = @optionalParam1)\n  AND (@optionalParam2 IS NULL OR MyColumn2 = @optionalParam2)\n\n```\n\nwill cache the first execution plan it is run with (e.g. `@optionalParam1 = 'Hello World', @optionalParam2 = NULL`) but then perform miserably if we pass it a different set of optional parameters (e.g. `@optionalParam1 = NULL, @optionalParam2 = 42`). (And obviously we want the performance of the cached plan, so `WITH RECOMPILE` is out)\n\nThe exception here is that if there is ALSO at least one MANDATORY filter on the query which is HIGHLY selective and properly indexed, in addition to the optional parameters, then the above PROC will perform fine.\n\nHowever, if ALL the filters are optional, the rather awful truth is that parameterized dynamic sql actually performs better (unless you write N! different static PROCS for each permutation of optional parameters). \n\nDynamic SQL like the below will create and cache a different plan for each permutation of the Query parameters, but at least each plan will be 'tailored' to the specific query (it doesn't matter whether it is a PROC or Adhoc SQL \\- as long as they are parameterized queries, they will be cached)\n\nSo hence my preference for :\n\n```\nDECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX)        \n\n-- Mandatory / Static part of the Query here\nSET @SQL = N'SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE 1 = 1'\n\nIF @OptionalParam1 IS NOT NULL        \n    BEGIN        \n        SET @SQL = @SQL + N' AND MyColumn1 = @optionalParam1'    \n    END        \n\nIF @OptionalParam2 IS NOT NULL        \n    BEGIN        \n        SET @SQL = @SQL + N' AND MyColumn2 = @optionalParam2'    \n    END        \n\nEXEC sp_executesql @SQL,        \n    N'@optionalParam1 NVARCHAR(50), \n      @optionalParam2 INT'\n    ,@optionalParam1 = @optionalParam1\n    ,@optionalParam2 = @optionalParam2\n\n```\n\netc. It doesn't matter if we pass in redundant parameters into `sp_executesql` \\- they are ignored.\nIt is worth noting that ORM's like Linq2SQL and EF use parameterized dynamic sql in a similar way.\n\nThe awful `1 == 1` hack can also be avoided if you keep track of whether any predicates have yet been applied or not, and then conditionally apply the first `AND` only on the second and subsequent predicates. If there are no predicates at all, then `WHERE` disappears as well.\n\nNote that despite the dynamic query, we are still `parameterizing` the filters, if present, so we have at least a first line of defence against SQL Injection attacks."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is tasked with implementing a filtered search form for a large table in SQL Server.

You can do this with the COUNT, COUNTIF, COUNTA and the like.

What specific purpose does it serve?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can some help me understand why the class is inheriting from a base of same type?\n\nIt's not, it's inheriting from `Page<T>`, but `T` itself is constrained to be parameterized by a type that is derived from `BasePage<T>`.\n\nTo infer why, you have to look at how the type parameter `T` is actually used. \nAfter some digging, as you move up the inheritance chain, you'll come up upon this class:\n\n([github](https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core/blob/4904258837af83f795ddd94ed4a05ca1c2bb3327/core/Piranha/Models/GenericPage.cs))\n\n```\npublic class GenericPage<T> : PageBase where T : GenericPage<T>\n{\n    public bool IsStartPage {\n        get { return !ParentId.HasValue && SortOrder == 0; }\n    }\n\n    public GenericPage() : base() { }\n\n    public static T Create(IApi api, string typeId = null)\n    {\n        return api.Pages.Create<T>(typeId);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAs far as I can see, the only purpose for the generic constraint is to make sure that the `Create` method returns the least abstract type possible.\n\nNot sure if it's worth it, though, but perhaps there's some good reason behind it, or it could be only for convenience, or maybe there's no too much substance behind it and it's just an overly elaborate way to avoid a cast (BTW, I'm not implying that is the case here, I'm just saying that people do that sometimes).\n\nNote that this doesn't allow them to avoid reflection \\- the `api.Pages` is a repository of pages that obtains `typeof(T).Name`, and passes it as the `typeId` to the `contentService.Create` method ([see here](https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core/blob/4904258837af83f795ddd94ed4a05ca1c2bb3327/core/Piranha/Repositories/PageRepository.cs))."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Piranha CMS codebase, what is the primary purpose of the generic constraint T : BasePage<T> in the class definition public abstract class BasePage<T> : Page<T> where T : BasePage<T>?\n\nA) To prevent compilation errors by ensuring type safety\nB) To allow the Create method to return the most specific type possible without casting\nC) To enable reflection-based page creation in the CMS\nD) To avoid inheritance from the same type\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The generic constraint T : BasePage<T> is used primarily to ensure that the Create method in derived classes (such as GenericPage<T>) can return the most specific type possible without requiring an explicit cast. This pattern, known as the curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP), allows for static polymorphism and enables methods to return the correct derived type.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the constraint does contribute to type safety, it's not the primary purpose in this context.\nOption C is incorrect because reflection is still used in the page creation process, as evidenced by the implementation in the PageRepository.\nOption D is incorrect because the class is not inheriting from the same type; it's inheriting from Page<T> with a constraint on T.\n\nThe correct answer, B, reflects the main benefit of this pattern in the Piranha CMS codebase, which is to provide a convenient way to create and return specific page types without the need for explicit casting."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/16", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184637", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/165931/"], "docs_id": 184637, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are changes rolling out the week of June 17 2013 to add custom close reasons.\n\n* [Closing changes: on hold, unclear, too broad, opinion\\-based, off\\-topic reasons, bye\\-bye to Too Localized](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons)\n\nWhat (and when) do site moderators need to do to configure these custom off\\-topic close reasons for each individual site?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Introduction\n------------\n\nPer\\-site off\\-topic reasons were created to reduce the amount of confusion and debate surrounding what *specifically* is on\\- or off\\-topic for a given site. Folks asking questions for the first time are often unclear on what is allowed or expected; by explaining common misconceptions in a clear manner, you can help these people better understand and learn to become productive members of your community.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n### You need to be aware of what's on\\- and off\\-topic for your site\n\nIf you've already had multiple discussions about what should go into your site's [on\\-topic](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) and [about](https://stackoverflow.com/about) pages, then you probably have a reasonable idea of where the boundaries sit here. If your community has worked to provide a solid set of FAQs on your meta site, then you're in great shape. But if you're still relying on the default \"audience description\" that came from Area51, you might have some work to do...\n\n### You need to know what the most common *misconceptions* are\n\nYou can find a list of recently\\-closed questions in [the 10K tools](https://stackoverflow.com/tools?tab=close). I've found it useful to look at a random sampling of recent questions closed as off\\-topic and too\\-localized. You can do the same using [this query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/120940)... but be aware that it excludes *deleted* posts, so the results will be somewhat skewed; also, beta sites aren't in SEDE. If you want a list for your site, ping me in chat.\n\n**Don't try to brainstorm on what you *think* should be or might be off\\-topic.** Critically examine what you're seeing in practice instead \\- this should be driven by the community, not by your own personal preferences or prejudices.\n\nDiscuss it with your community\n------------------------------\n\nClosing should be something that has wide\\-spread support on a site. If folks disagree as to what is on\\- or off\\-topic, then that's something that needs to be resolved before going further. In particular, topics that are allowed *with restrictions* need to have those restrictions hashed out and documented, either on your meta or on your [on\\-topic](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) page.\n\nSo take your ideas for off\\-topic reasons, throw them into a meta post and let folks discuss them.\n\nCreate the wording for each reason as it will appear on the site\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis can be tricky; your goal here is to communicate clearly with the people whose questions are being closed, with the people who are closing questions *and* with the people who will later read those questions and wonder why they were closed.\n\nAt a bare minimum, **off\\-topic reasons should identify a *specific* topic considered inappropriate**. If you're struggling to be specific, find an example of a question that is off\\-topic and discuss the factors that make it inappropriate for the site.\n\nWhenever possible, **try to explain *why* a given topic is not allowed** \\- this is your chance to answer the inevitable question *once* rather than repeating it every time a question must be closed.\n\n**Provide resources that will aid askers in solving their problems**: either instructions for asking the question in a more suitable fashion, links to a different site where the question may be considered on\\-topic.\n\n**Be as concise as possible**. Save *lengthy* explanations and examples for meta FAQs that can be discussed and refined over time, and then include links to these in the off\\-topic reasons. Don't depend on anyone following these links though; keep critical information and guidance in the reason text itself.\n\nDo all of this on your meta site so that folks can critique the wording and suggest improvements.\n\nPick the top three reasons\n--------------------------\n\nLarge lists make selection tedious and difficult. Fortunately, most sites do not attract an extremely high volume of off\\-topic questions, and those that are asked tend to be about a relatively small number of topics \\- therefore, we limit the number of active reasons to 3\\. A few sites do get a regular influx of off\\-topic questions in a larger number of distinct categories; if you find this to be the case on your site, post a feature\\-request on your meta site with examples of questions that would benefit from a predefined off\\-topic option \\- we'll verify the need for this and work with you to make more reasons available.\n\nAdd the reasons, approve them and activate them\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![The off-topic reason admin page can be accessed from the off-topic close dialog](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zS1ZR.png \"The off-topic reason admin page can be accessed from the off-topic close dialog\")\n\nAny moderator can [add a new off\\-topic reason](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186031/how-do-moderators-update-custom-off-topic-reasons-for-their-site), and an unlimited number of reasons can be added.\n\n![The reason editor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VX3bM.png)\n\nOnce you've settled on the wording for a reason, a moderator will need to approve it.\n\n![approve link available only to mods other than the author](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDItY.png)\n\nThe moderator who created a reason cannot approve it himself; we want *at least* two people to be reviewing these before making them available. Approving a reason also activates it, and as noted above, only 3 reasons can be active at any one time on most sites \\- to approve more than this, an existing reason will have to be deactivated first.\n\n![the deactivated reason list](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJKT3.png)\n\nOff\\-topic reasons can never be completely removed from the system \\- this prevents reasons that have been used on closed questions from disappearing and causing confusion. However, moderators can deactivate reasons at any time, which will prevent them from being used in the future (unless re\\-activated).\n\nYou can also drag active reasons to change the order in which they appear on the close dialog.\n\nMonitor the use of your off\\-topic reasons\n------------------------------------------\n\n**[A tool for monitoring the usage of these reasons](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257449/new-10k-tool-question-close-statistics) is available to moderators and 10K users on every site.**\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on how off\\-topic is being used on a site. If good questions are being closed incorrectly, the predefined reasons may be too vague; if too many bad questions are being left open or closed with \"other\" (custom comments left by the close\\-voter), then you may have picked the wrong reasons. If you see something amiss, don't hesitate to bring it up for discussion on your meta."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a moderator of a Stack Exchange site, you're tasked with setting up custom off-topic close reasons.

This software is often only available for Windows, which can be inconvenient for Linux users. After changing the mode, the drive should appear as a single 3TB device in Ubuntu.

So we've to intercept the mail before they arrive to the external SMTP.\nFor this, we've configured a local Postfix to substitute to the external SMTP.

Class is responsible of sending multiple, not connected messages to WebService, so when I was creating it, I didn't plan to put variables connected to given order as a class state. Is it a good practice to exclude such variables from function and make them class members? Are there any guidelines for situations like this? What are your practices and solutions for such problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Should one create shareable private class member or keep variable in method scope to pass it as a second method argument?\n\nThere is a third option, which is to formally address logically separate abstractions by introducing another class.\n\n> Class is responsible of sending multiple, not connected messages to WebService, so when I was creating it, I didn't plan to put variables connected to given order as a class state.\n\nIt looks to me like you are dealing with several abstractions here.\n\nSometimes we use multiple parameters instead of creating a formal abstraction. For example, we have an `x` coordinate and a `y` coordinate, and use those as parameters in several places. They are meant to be taken as a pair \u2014 they are thus an informal abstraction. To make the a formal abstraction we can create a `Point` class that binds the `x` and `y` together. Now where ever we had passed the two variables, we pass the single abstraction. A single abstraction is better than the variable pairs in that the client using these has fewer things to worry about, and the `Point` is more type safe and less error prone that the individual coordinate values (which might have been `int`s, for example). For example, one could accidentally swap `x` and `y`; one could use `x` with the wrong `y` when dealing with multiple points.\n\nGenerally speaking, it would be a mistake to include the fields of a logically different abstraction as members of some other abstraction. While it is hard to see from the code in your example, what the class in question is doing, it doesn't look like a good home just for passing parameters to these other functions (methods?).\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to add fields to an existing class vs. create create another class, here is one way to think about it. If they are logically separate abstractions then the should have separate classes. If they are one and the same abstraction, then add the fields to the class. Check the lifetime of the individual fields. If they all have the same lifetime (and all the same lifetime as object (the class's instances)), that is consistent with being a single logical abstraction. However, if some of the fields are uninitialized after the others are properly initialized (e.g. in the constructor or an init method), and the other fields are only initialized and valid during certain operation sequences, then they belong to a logically separate abstraction, which indicates separate classes.\n\nIn your example, `order` and `xmlorder` possibly form a logically separate abstraction for you to receive as parameter in the first method.\n\nFurther, `outputData` could be upgraded (either by adding fields to it or by creating a wrapper \u2014 use the above lifetime analysis to determine) to capture (`order` and `xmlorder`) and `outputData` and `customerCode`.\n\nThus, your code could look like this:\n\n```\npublic void SendOrder(OrderBundle orderBundle, Insider insider)\n{\n    string customerCode = CustomerServices\n                 .Get(insider.CustomerId)\n                 .Code;\n\n    OutputDataBundle outputBundle = CreateOutputData(orderBundle, customerCode);\n    outputBundle.CreateReservations();\n    outputBunlde.PlaceOrder();\n}\n\n```\n\n(Quality type \\& variable names notwithstanding.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When refactoring legacy code that results in methods with multiple parameters, which of the following approaches is recommended according to the top answer?\n\nA) Create private class members to store shared variables and reduce method parameters\nB) Keep all variables in method scope and pass them as arguments to other methods\nC) Introduce new classes to formally address logically separate abstractions\nD) Combine all related parameters into a single large object and pass it around\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that when faced with multiple parameters that represent logically separate abstractions, the best approach is to introduce new classes to formally address these abstractions.

The relationship between Watts (W) and Volt-Amperes (VA) is: W = VA * Power Factor (PF)\n2. The given power factor is 0.7, which is typical for most UPS systems.\n3. The PSU is rated at 700W, but it's important to note that the actual power consumption is usually less than the PSU's maximum rating.\n4.

This time I want to focus on motion. I've got a laser accelerometer on my desk. It tells me that I'm accelerating at $9\\.8\\~\\\\rm m/s^2$. For the first experiment I'm travelling in space. I pick a nearby star and discover that I move about $490$ meters in $10$ seconds from that star. For the next experiment I'm on the surface of Earth. I measure the same acceleration with my laser accelerometer. I pick a spot (the center of the Earth) and discover I don't move at all in $10$ seconds. How is acceleration without motion possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In relativity (both flavours) we consider trajectories in four dimensional spacetime, and acceleration is a four\\-vector not a three\\-vector as in Newtonian mechanics. We call this [four\\-acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration) while the Newtonian acceleration is normally referred to as *coordinate acceleration*.\n\nSupoose we pick some coordinate system $(t,x,y,z)$ and measure the trajectory of some observer in these coordinates. The way we usually do this is to express the value of the coordinates as a function of the [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time) of the observer, $\\\\tau$. That is the position is given by the functions $\\\\left(t(\\\\tau), x(\\\\tau), y(\\\\tau), z(\\\\tau)\\\\right)$. The proper time $\\\\tau$ is just the time recorded by a clock travelling with the observer, so we are describing the trajectory by how the position in our coordinates changes with the observer's time.\n\nIf we start by considering special relativity, i.e. flat spacetime, then the four\\-velocity and four\\-acceleration are calculated by differentiating once and twice respectively wrt time, just like in Newtonian mechanics. However we differentiate wrt the proper time $\\\\tau$. So the four\\-velocity $U$ and four\\-acceleration $A$ are:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf U \\= \\\\left( \\\\frac{dt}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dx}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dy}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dz}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right) $$\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf A \\= \\\\left( \\\\frac{d^2t}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2x}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2y}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2z}{d\\\\tau^2} \\\\right) $$\n\nThe four acceleration defined in this way is coordinate independent, and it behaves in a very similar way to Newtonian acceleration. For example we can (though we usually don't) write a relativistic equivalent of Newton's second law:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf F \\= m \\\\mathbf A $$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf F$ is the [four\\-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-force).\n\nTo complete the comparison with Newtonian mechanics we can choose our $(t,x,y,z)$ to be the coordinates in which the accelerating observer is momntarily at rest, and in these coordinates the four\\-acceleration becomes the [proper acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration), which is just the acceleration felt by the observer. Let me emphasise this because we'll use it later:\n\n> the four\\-acceleration is equal to the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame.\n\nAnyhow, this is all in flat spacetime, and in flat spacetime a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration means that in every inertial frame the position of the observer is changing with time. This ties up with the first part of your paragraph where you're talking about your position relative to a star changing with time. However in general relativity the expression for the four\\-acceleration has to include effects due to the curvature, and it becomes:\n\n$$ A^\\\\alpha \\= \\\\frac{d^2x^\\\\alpha}{d\\\\tau^2} \\+ \\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu \\\\tag{1} $$\n\nI've written this using Einstein notation as it's rather long to write out otherwise. The index $\\\\alpha$ is zero for $t$, one for $x$, two for $y$ and three for $z$. The new parameters $\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ in the equation are the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols) that describe how the spacetime is curved.\n\nThe difference from flat spacetime is that now we can have a (locally) inertial frame, where the spatial coordinates are not changing with time, and we can still have a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration. That is even if $x$, $y$ and $z$ are constant, so $d^2x/d\\\\tau^2$ etc are zero, the contribution from the Christoffel symbols means the four\\-acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$ can still be non\\-zero.\n\nAnd in general relativity it's still true that the four acceleration is the same as the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame, and this is the link to the second part of your question. Because of the curvature you can be (spatially) at rest on the surface of the Earth with respect to the distant star but still have a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration. But remember that above we said:\n\n> the four\\-acceleration is equal to the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame.\n\nThat means even though you are at rest in your coordinates your non\\-zero four\\-acceleration means you still feel an acceleration. That acceleration is of course just what we call gravity.\n\n**Response to comment: Moving in a straight line**\n\nThe obvious way to define motion in a straight line is to say that the acceleration is zero. In Newtonian mechanics this is just Newton's first law, where the acceleration is the coordinate acceleration $\\\\mathbf a$. Likewise in relativity (both flavours) a straight line means the four\\-acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$, defined by equation (1\\) above, is zero. Looking at equation (1\\), the only way for $\\\\mathbf A$ is if the $dx^\\\\alpha/d\\\\tau^2$ term exactly balances out the Christoffel symbol i.e.\n\n$$ \\\\frac{d^2x^\\\\alpha}{d\\\\tau^2} \\= \\-\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu \\\\tag{2} $$\n\nThis equation is called the [geodesic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_in_general_relativity), and it describes the trajectory of a freely falling particle in a curved spacetime. That is, it is the equation for a straight line in curved spacetime or more formally a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic).\n\nActually solving the geodesic equation is usually hard (like most things in GR) but for an overview of how this equation describes things falling in Earth's gravity see [How does \"curved space\" explain gravitational attraction?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/222390/how-does-curved-space-explain-gravitational-attraction).\n\n**Footnote: The elevator, the rocket, and gravity: the equivalence principle**\n\nThe above discussion provides a nice way to understand the elevator/rocket description of the equivalence principle. [See this article for a full discussion](http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/equivalence_principle), but in brief suppose you are inside a lift with the doors closed so you can't see out. You can feel a force pulling you down with an acceleration of $1$g, but you can't tell if the lift is stationary on the Earth and you're feeling gravity, or if you're in outer space and the lift has been attached to a rocket accelerating at $1$g.\n\nTo see why this is we take equation (1\\) and rewrite it as:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf A \\= \\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR} \\+ \\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR} \\\\tag{3} $$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$ is the term we get from special relativity, $d^2x^\\\\alpha/d\\\\tau^2$, and $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ is the term we get from general relativity, $\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu$.\n\nBut all you can measure is $\\\\mathbf A$. Remember that $\\\\mathbf A$ is equal to the acceleration in your rest frame, so if you have a set of scales in the lift you can measure your weight, divide by your mass, and you get your proper acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$.\n\nThe point is that although you can experimentally measure the left side of equation (3\\) the equivalence principle tells us that you can't tell what is on the right hand side. If the elevator is blasting through space on a rocket $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ is zero and all your acceleration comes from $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$. Alternatively if the elevator is stationary on Earth $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$ is zero and your acceleration comes from the $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ term. The equivalence principle tells us that there is no way for you to tell the difference."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An astronaut is inside a sealed spacecraft and experiences a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2.

Notice that to apply it you *need* to know either [conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability), or joint probabilities. This is a basic application of Bayes theorem and it has many nice applications (see e.g. [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/185817/interpretation-of-bayes-theorem-applied-to-positive-mammography-results)).\n\nNow important thing to notice: [applying Bayes theorem is **not the same** as using Bayesian statistics](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/243109/how-to-do-bayesian-updating-for-a-simple-practical-problem/243138#243138). $P(S)$ in your example is not more *prior*, then $P(R)$. Moreover, to calculate the \"posterior\" probability you need to know the joint or conditional probabilities. If you are thinking of some simple example like *\"there is 0\\.7 probability that Jack has stolen an orange from the shop\"*, you cannot apply Bayes theorem to such problem by assuming that in your opinion the probability is, for example, 0\\.3, unless you also know the joint probabilities (probability that he is guilty when you assume he is etc.), or conditional probabilities (probability that you assume that he is guilty given the fact that he is guilty). This is *not* the way how we use *priors* in statistics.\n\nWhen applying Bayes theorem in statistics we have some data $X$ that can be described using probability density function $f\\_\\\\theta$, but we do not know the value of it's parameter $\\\\theta$. To estimate $\\\\theta$ we can use many different statistical approaches, for example, [maximum likelihood estimation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/112451/maximum-likelihood-estimation-mle-in-layman-terms) by maximizing the likelihood function\n\n$$ \\\\DeclareMathOperator\\*{\\\\argmax}{arg\\\\,max} \\\\argmax\\_{\\\\theta} f\\_\\\\theta( X ) $$ \n\nOther approach to the problem is to include some *prior* information into the process of estimating the parameter and use a Bayesian approach. This is done by using Bayes theorem, but in a different way. First, we assume some probability distribution for $\\\\theta$, let's call it $g$, and then assume *a priori* that the unknown parameter follows this distribution. We use Bayes theorem to combine the two sources of information: our *a priori* assumptions about $\\\\theta$, that is our *prior* $g$; and the information that is contained in the data, that is [*likelihood*](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224037/wikipedia-entry-on-likelihood-seems-ambiguous/224299#224299) function $f\\_\\\\theta(X)$, so to obtain *posterior* estimate $g(\\\\theta \\| X)$: \n\n$$ g(\\\\theta \\| X) \\\\propto f\\_\\\\theta(X) \\\\, g(\\\\theta) $$\n\nIf this still sounds complicated, you can start by going through multiple other questions tagged [bayesian](/questions/tagged/bayesian \"show questions tagged 'bayesian'\") for lots of examples.

The more gear reduction you have the slower the motor will turn but with higher torque.\n\nWhen using a gearbox you are trading motor speed for torque. It is quite simple calculating the RPM from the reduction ratio. Assuming you motor spins at 500 RPM and your gear is 1:46 then the motor with gear will spin at 500/46 \\= 10\\.86RPM.\nIn stepper motors it is not so simple to determine what is the motor top speed as it depends on the voltage you use, the driver (better drivers can drive the motor faster) and the quality of the motor. It is also important to know that stepper motors have different torques in different RPMS and \"Usually\" (but not always) the slower you go the more torque you have.\n\nGearbox does not affect the motor life no mater what is the gear ratio.

What is the maximum output speed of the gearbox shaft, and how does this affect the system's performance?\n\nA) 20 RPM; increases torque but reduces positioning speed\nB) 18,000 RPM; increases both speed and torque\nC) 600 RPM; no change in speed or torque\nD) 30 RPM; decreases torque but increases positioning accuracy\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is A. To calculate the output speed of the gearbox shaft, we divide the motor's maximum speed by the reduction ratio:\n\n600 RPM / 30 = 20 RPM\n\nThis reduction in speed results in an increase in torque, as per the principle of gear reduction mentioned in the passage.

I know some category theory (at the level of Simmons) and differential and Riemannian geometry (at the level of Lee's series) but I don't have any background in categorical logic or model theory.\n\nI've recently come across some interesting [surveys](http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/sdg-pizza-seminar.pdf) and articles on synthetic differential geometry (SDG) that made the approach seem very appealing. Many of the definitions become very elegant, such as the definition of the tangent bundle as an exponential object. The ability to argue rigorously using infinitesimals also appeals to the physicist in me, and seems to yield more intuitive proofs.\n\nI just have a few questions about SDG which I hope some experts could answer. How much of modern differential geometry (Cartan geometry, poisson geometry, symplectic geometry, etc.) has been reformulated in SDG? Have any physical theories such as general relativity been reformulated in SDG? If so, is the synthetic formulation more or less practical than the classical formulation for computations and numerical simulations?\n\nAlso, how promising is SDG as an area of research? How does it compare to other alternative theories such as the ones discussed in [comparative smootheology](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/comparative_smootheology.html)? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One point of [synthetic differential geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+differential+geometry) is that, indeed, it is \"synthetic\" in the spirit of traditional [synthetic geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic%20geometry) but refined now from incidence geometry to differential geometry. Hence the name is rather appropriate and in particular highlights that SDG is more than any one of its models, such as those based on formal duals of [C\\-infinity rings](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+algebra) (\"[smooth loci](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+locus)\"). Indeed, traditional algebraic geometry with [formal schemes](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/formal%20scheme) is another model for SDG and this is where the origin of the theory lies: William Lawvere was watching Alexander Grothendieck's work and after abstracting the concept of [elementary topos](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topos) from what Grothendieck did with sheaves, he next abstracted the [Kock\\-Lawvere axioms](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kock-Lawvere%20axiom) of SDG from what Grothendieck did with [infinitesimal extensions](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinitesimal+extension), formal schemes and [crystals](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/crystal)/[de Rham spaces](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/de%20Rham%20space). The idea of SDG is to abstract the essence of all these niceties, formulate them in terms of elementary topos theory, and hence lay mathematical foundations for differential geoemtry that are vastly more encompassing than either algebraic geometry or traditional differential geometry alone. For instance there are also models in [supergeometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+differential+supergeometry), in complex analytic geometry and in much more exotic versions of \"differential calculus\" (such as Goodwillie calculus, see below).\n\nRegarding applications, a curious fact that remains little known is that Lawvere, while widely renowned for his work in the foundations of mathematics, has from the very beginning and throughout the decades been directly motivated by, actually, laying foundations for continuum physics. See [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/William%20Lawvere#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysics) for commented list of pointers and citations on that aspects. In particular SDG was from the very beginning intended to formalize mechanics, that's why one of the earliest texts on the topic is titled \"[Toposes of laws of motion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Toposes+of+laws+of+motion)\" (referring to SDG toposes).\n\nA little later Lawvere tried another approach to such foundations, not via the KL\\-axioms this time, but via \"[axiomatic cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive%20topos)\". One may recover SDG in axiomatic cohesion in a way that realizes it in close parallel to modern [D\\-geometry](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/D-geometry) with axiomatic [de Rham stacks](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/de+Rham+space), jet\\-bundles, D\\-modules and all. I like to call this [differential cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/differential%20cohesion) but of course it doesn't matter what one calls it.\n\nViewed from this perspective the scope of models for the SDG axiomatics becomes more powerful still. For instance [Goodwille tangent calculus](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Goodwillie%20calculus) is now also part of the picture, in terms of synthetic [tangent cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tangent+cohesion). Another model is in spectral derived geometry that knows about structures of relevance in arithmetic geometry, chromatic homotopy theory and class field theory, this is discussed at *[differential cohesion and idelic structure](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/differential%20cohesion%20and%20idelic%20structure)*.\n\nAll this synthetic reasoning is maybe best viewed from the general perspective that it is useful in mathematics to stratify all theory as much as possible by the hierarchy of assumptions and axioms needed, try to prove as much as possible from as little assumptions as necessary and pass to fully concrete models only at the very end. If you are interested only in one specific model, such as derived geometry over $C^\\\\infty$\\-rings, then such synthetic reasoning may offer some guidance but might otherwise seem superfluous. The power of the synthetic method is in how it allows to pass between models, see their similarities and differences, and prove model\\-independent theorems. As in \"I don\u2019t want you to think all this is theory for the sake of it, or rather for the sake of itself. It\u2019s theory for the sake of other theory.\" ([Lurie, ICM 2010](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/08/31/icm2010-spielman-csornyei-lurie/)) Synthetic geometry is \"inter\\-geometric\", to borrow a term\\-formation from Mochizuki. If you run into something like the [function field analogy](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/function%20field%20analogy) then it may be time to step back and ask if such analogy between different flavors of geometry maybe comes from the fact that they all are models for the same set of \"synthetic\" axioms."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between synthetic differential geometry (SDG) and other areas of mathematics and physics?\n\nA) SDG is primarily useful for reformulating classical differential geometry, with limited applications to other fields.\n\nB) SDG is a narrow field focused solely on providing rigorous foundations for infinitesimal reasoning in physics.\n\nC) SDG serves as a unifying framework that connects various areas of mathematics and provides foundations for continuum physics.\n\nD) SDG is mainly used in algebraic geometry and has little relevance to other branches of mathematics or physics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the text emphasizes that SDG serves as a broad, unifying framework that connects multiple areas of mathematics and provides foundations for continuum physics. \n\nThe passage mentions that SDG was inspired by and abstracts concepts from algebraic geometry, traditional differential geometry, and even supergeometry.

According to the StackExchange documentation, it's best to model the relationship in one direction in your code and let the database handle the consistency when dealing with many-to-many relationships. This approach avoids circular reference and consistency issues that can arise from modeling both directions simultaneously in code.

I guess NO, can anyone explain why?\nin this case is there a way to relate the different predictors' coefficients to have a comparative understanding?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that normalizing the coefficients will not affect the predictions, but it will mess up the estimated class probabilities. Don't do it.\n\nThe coefficients don't represent the *odds ratios* but rather the *feature weights*. They can be negative. If a coefficient is strongly positive, it means that the corresponding feature is very much correlated with the positive class. If it is strongly negative, then its means that the feature is strongly correlated with the negative class. If the coefficient is close to zero, then it means that the feature is not correlated much with either the positive or the negative class.\n\nSo if you want to compare the importance of each feature, you should compare the absolute values of the coefficients (and you can normalize them just for convenience, if you want, but don't use these normalized absolute coefficients to make predictions, only use them to compare feature importance). (**Edit**: this assumes that the features have been normalized prior to training)\n\nThis is probably all you need to know. Read on if you want to understand what would happen if you tried to normalize the coefficients.\n\nThe decision function for logistic regression is:\n\n$h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\= \\\\sigma(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i)$\n\nwhere $\\\\sigma(t) \\= \\\\dfrac{1}{1 \\+ \\\\exp(\\-t)}$ (the *logistic function*)\n\nand $\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}$ is the parameter vector, and $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is the feature vector (including a bias term $x\\_0 \\= 1$) and $n$ is the number of features.\n\nThe model's prediction $\\\\hat{y}$ for the instance $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is given by:\n\n$\n\\\\hat{y} \\=\n\\\\begin{cases}\n 0 \\& \\\\text{ if }h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\< 0\\.5\\\\\\\\\n 1 \\& \\\\text{ if }h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\ge 0\\.5\n\\\\end{cases}\n$\n\nNotice that $\\\\sigma(t) \\\\ge 0\\.5$ when $t \\\\ge 0$, and $\\\\sigma(t) \\< 0\\.5$ when $t \\< 0$ so the prediction simplifies to:\n\n$\n\\\\hat{y} \\=\n\\\\begin{cases}\n 0 \\& \\\\text{ if }\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i \\< 0\\\\\\\\\n 1 \\& \\\\text{ if }\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i \\\\ge 0\n\\\\end{cases}\n$\n\nIf you normalize the feature vector, you get the new parameter vector $\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}} \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}}{K} $. Since the coefficients can be negative, it would not make sense to divide them by the sum of coefficients (the sum could be negative or zero). So instead, let's define $K$ as the range of values (anyway, even if you choose another method for normalization, it does not change what follows).\n\n$K \\= \\\\underset{i}\\\\max(\\\\theta\\_i) \\- \\\\underset{i}\\\\min(\\\\theta\\_i)$\n\nLook at what happens to the sum used for predictions:\n\n$\n\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\_i x\\_i \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\dfrac{\\\\theta\\_i}{K} x\\_i \\= \\\\dfrac{1}{K}\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i\n$\n\nEverything just got multiplied by the constant $\\\\dfrac{1}{K}$.\n\nIf $K \\> 0$, the predictions don't change a bit, since $\\\\dfrac{1}{K} \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i$ has the same sign as $\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i$. If $K \\= 0$ (which can only happen if all coefficients are equal), then $K$ is not defined (you can't normalize the coefficients). If you use another normalization technique, and end up with $K\\<0$, then all predictions get reversed, which is probably not a good idea!\n\nSo normalizing the coefficients (by dividing them by their range of values) will not affect predictions. However, it will mess up the decision function $h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}$. This function is used to estimate the probability of the positive class. By multiplying all coefficients by $\\\\dfrac{1}{K}$, you will end up making the same predictions (since the sign is not affected), but the estimated probability will be higher or lower depending on the value of $K$. For example, if $K \\= 2$ then:\n\n$h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{\\\\theta}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\= \\\\sigma(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\_i x\\_i) \\= \\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{2} \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i\\\\right)$\n\nThis can't be simplified much: if you plot the curve of $\\\\sigma(t)$ and compare it to $\\\\sigma(\\\\frac{1}{2}t)$, you will find that this updated model will be much less confident about its predictions. For no good reason."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In logistic regression, what is the effect of normalizing the coefficients (dividing each by the overall range) on the model's predictions and probability estimates?\n\nA) It changes both the predictions and the probability estimates.\nB) It changes the predictions but doesn't affect the probability estimates.\nC) It doesn't change the predictions but affects the probability estimates.\nD) It has no effect on either the predictions or the probability estimates.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nNormalizing the coefficients in logistic regression by dividing them by their overall range does not change the model's predictions. This is because the sign of the decision function (\u2211\u03b8\u1d62x\u1d62) remains the same after normalization, which determines the class prediction.\n\nHowever, this normalization does affect the probability estimates. The logistic function \u03c3(t) is used to convert the decision function into probabilities. When the coefficients are normalized, it's equivalent to scaling the input to this function, which changes the shape of the probability curve. This means that while the class predictions remain the same, the confidence (probability) associated with those predictions will be different.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the predictions don't change. Option B is incorrect because it's the opposite of what actually happens. Option D is incorrect because while the predictions are unchanged, the probability estimates are affected. Therefore, C is the correct answer, accurately describing that the predictions remain the same but the probability estimates are altered."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/17", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/90302", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/12982/"], "docs_id": 90302, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: i have to remove \"My account\" \\& \"Log out\" links from some phtml pages.\nfor removing my account, i am using following code :\n\n```\n<marketplace_marketplaceaccount_myproductslist>\n<reference name=\"top.links\">\n   <remove name=\"account_link\"/>\n</reference>\n</marketplace_marketplaceaccount_myproductslist>\n\n```\n\nfor removing Login and log out , i am using following code :\n\n```\n<marketplace_marketplaceaccount_myproductslist>\n<action method=\"removeLinkByUrl\">\n<url helper=\"customer/getLoginUrl\"/>\n</action>\n</marketplace_marketplaceaccount_myproductslist>\n\n```\n\nbut both are not working\n\n**Update :header.phtml**\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Magento\n *\n * NOTICE OF LICENSE\n *\n * This source file is subject to the Academic Free License (AFL 3.0)\n * that is bundled with this package in the file LICENSE_AFL.txt.\n * It is also available through the world-wide-web at this URL:\n * http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-3.0.php\n * If you did not receive a copy of the license and are unable to\n * obtain it through the world-wide-web, please send an email\n * to license@magentocommerce.com so we can send you a copy immediately.\n *\n * DISCLAIMER\n *\n * Do not edit or add to this file if you wish to upgrade Magento to newer\n * versions in the future.

This method is called when a customer initiates the checkout process, making it the ideal place to add custom validation logic.\n\nBy rewriting this controller method, you can add code to check the total quantity of items in the cart and determine if it's a multiple of 12.

This can be determined from several key pieces of information in the description:\n\n1. The hinge is described as \"overlay,\" meaning the door sits on the front of the faceframe when closed.\n2.

Though sinks usually connect to 1\\-1/2\" pipe, anything below slab level is usually upsized to 2\" for clog avoidance and easier cleaning. You'd reduce it above floor level. It's positioned to be either in the wall or in the cabinet.\n\nThe center is the toilet. 4\" stubs are often used so that you can install an inside (hub) flange, reducing the inlet to a standard 3\" toilet connection. You'd cut it off and install a cement\\-in flange over your flooring. It's positioned to be centered 12\" off your finished wall surface.\n\nThe right one is for a shower. They're typically left with a box around them so you can fine\\-tune position for the pan or tub you select by adding a trap assembly. The pail is simply a concrete form/barrier.\n\nIf you're going to eliminate the shower, just cut the stub below floor level, cap it, and fill in the boxed area with concrete. There's nothing to bust up.\n\n*Disclaimer: Plumbing is like a box of chocolates. You never know.... The pipe on the left could be a vent for the toilet.

What is the most appropriate course of action for the homeowner regarding these pipes?\n\nA) Cut and cap all three pipes below floor level, then pour concrete over them.\nB) Use the left pipe for a sink, the center for a toilet, and remove the right pipe completely.\nC) Use the center pipe for a toilet, cap the right pipe below floor level, and investigate the left pipe's purpose before deciding.\nD) Use all three pipes as-is, installing a shower even though it wasn't in the original plan.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The center pipe, being 4\" in diameter, is most likely for a toilet. The right pipe, surrounded by a box, is typically for a shower drain. Since the homeowner doesn't want a shower, this can be cut below floor level, capped, and covered with concrete. The left pipe could be for a sink, but it could also be a vent for the toilet. Its proximity to the wall (14.5\") makes it worth investigating further before deciding its use. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to use the center pipe for the toilet, cap the right pipe, and investigate the left pipe's purpose before making a final decision on its use."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/06", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/337490", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/4997921/"], "docs_id": 337490, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Why does Stack Exchange penalize people that ask questions that call for a discussion.
