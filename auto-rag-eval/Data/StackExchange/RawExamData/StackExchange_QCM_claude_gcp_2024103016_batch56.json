The ship is traveling with half the speed of light. The astronaut will find, if he makes the proper measurements, that the beam is still passing him at its usual velocity of 299,800 kilometers per second! ***Think about this for a moment and you will soon realize that this must indeed be the case if the notion of an ether wind is discarded. If the astronaut found that light slowed down relative to his motion, he would have detected the very ether wind that Michelson and Morley failed to detect.*** Similarly, if his spaceship travels directly toward a source of light, moving with half the speed of light, will he find the beam approaching him twice as fast? No, it is still moving toward him at 299,800 kilometers per second. Regardless of how he moves relative to the beam, his measurements will always give the beam the same speed\n\nI cannot follow the reasoning of this statement. The Michelson and Morley experiment proved that there was no ether wind, but I cannot see how it proves anything else.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sorry, but the Michelson\\-Morely did not prove that there is no ether wind. It proved that, if there is an ether wind, it is at rest with respect to the surface of the earth, regardless of the motion of the earth with respect to the rest of the universe. \n\nWhile it is extremely difficult to imagine how this could possibly be, since it requires that the ether be entrained by the surface without affecting the momentum of the earth, this has not stopped various folk from trying, and some of them have been extremely ingenious.\n\nGardner's statement simply reflects this hypothesis, and suggests that, far from the surface of a large body, any ether should not be entrained, and the MM experiment would give different results \\- assuming that the ether wind exists. He rejects the idea that this is going to happen, since he is in fact explaining SR.\n\nSince Gardner wrote his book, it's worth pointing out that various aspects of space travel, including the behavior of the GPS system and communications with probes to other planets, make the entrained ether wind very, very hard to support. GPS, for instance, requires that the ether wind be entrained at considerable distances from the earth, and it's hard to see how this can be."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation given, what is the primary significance of the Michelson-Morley experiment in relation to the concept of ether wind?\n\nA) It conclusively disproved the existence of ether wind\nB) It proved that ether wind exists but is undetectable near Earth's surface\nC) It demonstrated that ether wind, if it exists, is at rest relative to Earth's surface\nD) It showed that ether wind varies depending on the speed of light\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Michelson-Morley experiment did not definitively disprove the existence of ether wind. Instead, it showed that if ether wind exists, it appears to be at rest relative to Earth's surface, regardless of Earth's motion through space. This finding was unexpected and difficult to explain, as it would require the ether to be somehow entrained by Earth's surface without affecting Earth's momentum. While this result made the concept of ether wind problematic, it did not completely rule it out. The answer highlights the nuanced interpretation of the experiment's results, rather than the common misconception that it outright disproved ether wind.

The residuals (differences between all possible pairs?) should be distributed normally.\n\nI found this statement in multiple answers on CV ([1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/15245/68423), [2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/115618/68423)). By analogy of rANOVA to [the paired t\\-test](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15940/can-i-use-a-paired-t-test-when-the-samples-are-normally-distributed-but-their-di), this might also seem intuitive.\n3. Multivariate normality should be satisfied.\n\nWikipedia and [this source](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/repeated_ut.htm) mention this. Also, I know that rANOVA can be [swapped](http://www.mlrv.ua.edu/2002/VOL_28_1/vol28_n1_a1.pdf) with MANOVA, which might merit this claim.\n\nAre these equivalent somehow? I know that multivariate normality means that *any* linear combination of the DVs is normally distributed, so 3\\. would naturally include 2\\. if I understand the latter correctly. \n\nIf these are not the same, which is the \"true\" assumption of the rANOVA? Can you provide a reference?\n\nIt seems to me there is most support for the first claim. This is not in line, however, with the answers usually provided here.\n\n---\n\nLinear mixed models\n-------------------\n\nDue to @utobi's hint, I now understand how rANOVA can be restated as a linear mixed model. Specifically, to model how blood pressure changes with time, I would model the expected value as:\n$$\n\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left\\[y\\_{ij}\\\\right]\\=a\\_{i}\\+b\\_i t\\_{ij},\n$$\nwhere $y\\_{ij}$ are measurements of blood pressure, $a\\_{i}$ the average blood pressure of the $i$\\-th subject, and $t\\_{ij}$ as the $j$\\-th time the $i$\\-th subject was measured, $b\\_i$ denoting that the *change* in blood pressure is different across subject, too. Both effects are considered random, since the sample of subjects is only a random subset of the population, which is of primary interest.\n\nFinally, I tried to think about what this means for normality, but to little success. To paraphrase McCulloch and Searle (2001, p. 35\\. Eq. (2\\.14\\)):\n\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left\\[y\\_{ij}\\|a\\_i\\\\right] \\&\\= a\\_i \\\\\\\\\\[5pt]\ny\\_{ij}\\|a\\_i \\&\\\\sim \\\\mathrm{indep.}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(a\\_i,\\\\sigma^2\\) \\\\\\\\\\[5pt]\na\\_i \\&\\\\sim \\\\mathrm{i.i.d.}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(a,\\\\sigma\\_a^2\\)\n\\\\end{align}\n\nI understand this to mean that \n\n**4\\.** each individual's data needs to be normally distributed, but this is unreasonable to test with few time points. \n\nI take the third expression to mean that \n\n**5\\.** averages of individual subjects are normally distributed. Note that these are another two distinct possibilities on top of the three mentioned above.\n\n---\n\nMcCulloch, C. E. \\& Searle, S. R. (2001\\). *Generalized, Linear, and Mixed models*.

However, I'm not convinced this implies normality of residuals ($3 \\\\rightarrow 2$), given residuals are determined by independent variables (groups, in ANOVA) as well.

This aligns with the general assumption in linear models, including ANOVA and regression. \n\nOption A is a common but somewhat simplified interpretation. Option C (multivariate normality) is a stronger condition than necessary and is more relevant to MANOVA. Option D relates to a random effects interpretation in mixed models, which is not the primary focus of traditional repeated measures ANOVA.\n\nThe correct answer (B) emphasizes the importance of normally distributed residuals, which is consistent with the underlying statistical theory and allows for valid inference in repeated measures designs.

This is the part i am currently stuck on. any suggestion or help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Use another timer and set it up to expire after a period equal to the period of the lowest frequency you intend to detect. For example, say you want the \"no signal\" LED to light when the input frequency is less than 1 Hz. Then set the period of this new timer to 1 second. Anytime an edge is detected, reset this timer's counter so that it will expire in 1 second. This way the timer will never expire as long as you're getting edges more often than once per second. But when you don't get an edge within one second than this timer will expire and in the timer's ISR you can light the \"no signal\" LED."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An embedded systems engineer is designing a frequency detection system using an ATmega328P microcontroller. The system currently detects square wave frequencies and lights up LEDs based on specific frequency thresholds. The engineer now wants to add a feature to indicate when no signal is being received. Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient and reliable way to implement this \"no signal\" detection?\n\nA) Continuously poll the interrupt pin in the main loop and set a flag if no change is detected for a certain period.\n\nB) Use a software counter in the main loop that increments every cycle and resets on each interrupt, lighting the LED when the counter reaches a threshold.\n\nC) Implement a watchdog timer that resets the microcontroller if no interrupt is received within a set time period, using the reset as an indicator of no signal.\n\nD) Set up an additional timer to expire after a period equal to the lowest detectable frequency, resetting it on each edge detection, and trigger the LED in the timer's ISR if it expires.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most efficient and reliable approach. By using an additional hardware timer, the solution offloads the timing responsibility from the main CPU, allowing for more precise timing and lower power consumption. The timer can be set to expire after a period corresponding to the lowest frequency of interest (e.g., 1 second for 1 Hz). Each time an edge is detected on the input, the timer is reset. If no edge is detected within the set period, the timer expires, and its Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) can be used to light the \"no signal\" LED. This method is more accurate than software polling (A), more efficient than a software counter (B), and less disruptive than using a watchdog timer reset (C)."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/28", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/55406772", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4192179/"], "docs_id": 55406772, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Swift iOS app which I want to avoid the process of creating a login/signup authentication for user.

By definition 1, if we move the lens closer to the sensor to focus, it will change the focal length. But by definition 2, the focal length is intrinsic to the lens and will never change.\n\nHow do these two definitions relate?

It doesn't change when focusing on different objects. However, focus breathing, a minor effect where the apparent focal length slightly changes during focusing, may occur. This effect is usually negligible in still photography but can be noticeable in video work. Options A and B incorrectly suggest that focal length directly changes with lens movement.

According to the documentation, iOS doesn't actually keep apps \"running in the background\" in the traditional sense. When a user presses the Home button, apps enter a Background state and are then typically moved to a Suspended state where they're not using system resources. The multitasking tray is merely a list of recently used apps, not necessarily currently running apps. There's no need to manually manage apps in this tray except in rare cases where an app needs to be forcibly restarted. This approach allows iOS to efficiently manage system resources without requiring user intervention."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/17", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/28250", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4598/"], "docs_id": 28250, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to design a 1 GHz low\\-pass filter. I have tried to find a COTS lowpass filter at such high frequencies but I can't find one. \n\nHence, I have decided to design one using microstrip lines. So, can someone guide me through the process of designing microstrip based filters? or suggest any other alternative way to achieve this filter? I could not find a good tutorial online for the same. If such a tutorial exists, please give me the link.\n\nRequirements for the filter: \n\n1. Flat band response throughout the 1 GHz frequency range with a ripple of less than 2\\-3 dB.\n2. Transition band of less than 50 MHz.\n3. Attenuation in the rejection band of atleast 15 dB.\n4. Attenuation in the pass band is at maximum 2 dB.\n5. Input signal strength in the pass band is of the range of \\-10 dBm to \\-30 dBm.\n\nPlease note that I am not very strict on the above conditions but this is roughly the type of filter that I need.\n\n**Edit\\-1**\n\nThis is the frequency spectrum of my input signal. I want to retain the information which is present upto 1 GHz frequency range. As you notice, the signal is already weak at higher frequencies, so the attenuation required at higher frequencies is much lower.\n\n![Frequency spectrum of input signal](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wJUg.jpg)\n\nPlease note that the photograph has been taken using a very bad camera, but the spectrum is from 0 to 4\\.5 GHz and hence 450 MHz/division on x\\-axis. The reference for the measurements in dB is 20 dBm and each unit on y\\-axis is 10dB.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't answer this authoritatively but my gut tells me your spec is going to be \"very difficult\".\n\nIn particular, your transition band of 50 MHz is only 0\\.02 decades at 1 GHz, so you're looking for a drop of 714 dB/decade between your pass band edge and your rejection band. Which implies something like a 71\\-pole filter, requiring 71 active elements.\n\nFor reference, here's what can be done with a reasonable number of elements:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUtpm.png)\n\n(Graph from TI's App Guide \"[Op\\-Amps for Everyone](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slod006b/slod006b.pdf)\") The graph is in terms of \"normalized frequency\", meaning you can scale the filter elements in such a way as to make a frequency of \"1\" on the graph correspond to any frequency you choose, for example 1 GHz in your case.\n\nAt lower frequencies, we normally construct multi\\-pole filters by cascading 1 and 2\\-pole active sections to obtain some desired response. \n\nAt 1 GHz, you may, just be able to do that using rf amplifiers to buffer between stages. But more likely, you'll be stuck falling back on older techniques of constructing an LC ladder to get an approximation of the response you want. The problem with this technique is it tends to make the filter response more sensitive to small variations in the component values, caused by manufacturing differences or temperature sensitivities.\n\nUsing microstrip elements, you might have less trouble with L and C variability, but you're likely to find that the range of L and C values required are outside of what can be sensibly constructed in microstrip. In addition, my (very limitted) experience suggests that microstrip filters are only likely to be effective over about an octave frequency range. So if you want a 1 GHz LPF, you might find you get an unwanted blocking band below 500 MHz, or an unwanted pass\\-band above 2 GHz. In any case you don't want to jump in to designing microstrip filters without access to some kind of reasonable CAD tool. Agilent's ADS or Genesys jump to mind. Genesys would be particularly helpful for you, if you can get access to it, because it provides special tools for generating filter designs given a spec like you've given in your question.\n\nOf course, a combination of lumped and microstrip elements is also possible.\n\n**Edit:**\nOne reasonable design approach would be to use a tool like Matlab or Octave to see what kind of filter (Butterworth, Chebychev, etc, and how many poles) can come close to meeting your requirements. If you have access to a good library, look for a book with a title like \"filter design handbook\". This will give you lookup tables for the pole and zero locations of various types of filter of different orders. This will make it \"easy\" to calculate the response even if you don't have a high\\-priced tool like Matlab with the right toolbox to get the filter parameters from software. \n\nThen, once you know where you want your poles and zeros, use a tool like ADS, or Genesys, or even SPICE, to design a filter using real L and C elements to create the mathematical response you optimized in Matlab. Then, be sure to do a sensitivity analysis to be sure the response stays in spec under normal variation of the part characteristics. Finally, depending on the L and C values you come up with, decide whether you want to implement some or all of those elements in microstrip instead of with discrete components. If you do decide to use microststrip, then use an rf design tool like ADS or Genesys (those are just two tools I've used myself, but there are others that could do this) to simulate and optimize the microstrip layout to achieve the behavior you want.\n\nAnother late note: You can see in the graph that for a Chebychev filter, the slope immediately after cut\\-off is steeper than the eventual slope of the skirt, so my statement of needing a 71\\-pole filter is probably too strong. But nonetheless, its clear you need at least 10 poles to meet your spec, and doing that with only passives is very challenging because of the stage\\-to\\-stage interactions and the required tight tolerances on the component values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer wants to design a 1 GHz low-pass filter with a transition band of less than 50 MHz. Based on the information provided, what is the most accurate statement about the feasibility and design approach for this filter?\n\nA) The filter can be easily designed using standard off-the-shelf components due to the common frequency range.\n\nB) A microstrip-based design alone would be sufficient to meet all the specified requirements.\n\nC) The filter specifications are challenging and may require a combination of techniques, including active elements, LC ladder, and possibly microstrip elements.\n\nD) A simple 2-pole active filter cascade would be adequate to achieve the desired frequency response.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the filter specifications, particularly the narrow transition band of 50 MHz at 1 GHz, are very demanding. The documentation suggests that this would require a very high-order filter (potentially 10 poles or more), which is challenging to implement with passive components alone. The answer states that a combination of techniques might be necessary, which aligns with the expert's suggestion of possibly using active elements, LC ladder designs, and microstrip elements. This approach would allow for the best compromise between performance and feasibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because off-the-shelf components for such a demanding filter at 1 GHz are not readily available, as mentioned in the original question.\n\nOption B is not correct because the documentation indicates that microstrip alone might not be sufficient and could introduce unwanted effects like blocking bands at lower frequencies or pass-bands at higher frequencies.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a simple 2-pole active filter cascade would not provide the steep roll-off required for the narrow transition band specified."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/01", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/819478", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/374288/"], "docs_id": 819478, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The solution I want to solve is to discover newly connected ip (and preferably mac and vendor) on the local network.\n\nSo far I've tried arp\\-scan and nmap. \n\nI like arp\\-scan mainly because it's fast and pretty easy to create output from a bash script to a file. \n\nHowever, it doesn't seem to discover more than one of the connected computers, where there is is actually 3\\. nmap makes a better job but it's more complex to create the wanted output and it's way slower. \n\nThis is run in a bash script (in a loop):\n\n```\nsudo arp-scan --interface=wlan0 --localnet | sed '1, 2d' | head -n -3 > ipDump.lst \n\n```\n\nThe pipes are just for formatting and to print it to a file (ipDump.lst).\n\nI'm quite stuck in only discovering one computer. \n\nMy questions: \n\nWhat I'm I doing wrong with arp\\-scan? \n\nIs there any other program that fits my needs better?\n\nIs my best solution nmap and if so: how should I configure it to be fast (I don't need port information or any other info) and create output that can pratically be outputed as ip adresses on each row to a file?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is an `arpwatch` daemon which does this quite well.

It is very possible to gain 1000 AP in a game with veigar with a normal build but I wouldn't recommend buying Lichbane a lot but I'll include it here for the highest possible burst damage in under 2 seconds.\n\nNow If you open up with DFG you'll already have 20% of the enemies HP and a 20% magic damage increase. \n\nThis means you can hit for a total of: **20% HP \\+ 1381\\.95 \\+ 392% AP \\+ 96% Enemy AP** with DFG, Your Skills and an autoattack.\n\nLet's say you're up against a Syndra on level 18 with 2000 HP, 600 AP and 100 Magic resistance while you have farmed up to get exactly 1000 AP. \n\nIf you full Combo Her you'd hit her for: \n\n```\n400 (20% HP) +\n3920 (392 % of your AP) +\n576 (96% of her AP) +\n1382 (Base damage rounded up)\n_______________________________\n6278 Raw damage\n\n```\n\nNow even if you take her Magic resistance into account you'll still deal **3139 damage** which is pretty much an overkill.

One can build a counter example simply by choosing appropriate initial conditions.\n\nIf your are asking about a stationary state, I can not prove anything but I can argue that the answer is no as well: A stationary flow along the tube, must be driven by a pressure gradient. The definition of a homoentropic fluid is that, up to an additive constant, the pressure and the density are proportional to each other (and the proportionality constant is positive). Then there is as well a gradient of density along the tube. The density is greater upstream and lower downstream. The mass flux is the product of the density and velocity and must be the same at both ends of the tube. If not the system is gaining or loosing particles and is not stationary. Then if there is a high density at the inlet and a low density at the outlet the velocity must compensate in order for the mass fluxes to be the same.

Disabling iptables (option B) is part of a good troubleshooting process, but it's not comprehensive enough on its own. Reinstalling Tomcat (option C) is a drastic measure that should be considered only after other troubleshooting steps have failed.\n\nOption D provides the most comprehensive approach to troubleshooting the issue. It covers multiple potential problem areas:\n1. Checking application listeners can reveal if any specific configurations are causing conflicts.\n2. Disabling iptables helps rule out firewall-related issues.\n3. Verifying IP bindings ensures there are no network configuration problems.\n4.

According to the StackExchange documentation, the Bosch Colt Palm Router's motor shaft is likely too small to support a 1/2\" collet. The specs and accessories for this model only show a 1/4\" collet as being available, indicating that the motor shaft size is insufficient for safely using larger bits. This limitation is important for safety and performance, as the documentation emphasizes that at high speeds, a large, well-supported drive shaft is crucial.
