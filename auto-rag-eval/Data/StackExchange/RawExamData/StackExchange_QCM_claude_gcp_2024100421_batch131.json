So what have I neglected? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I started trying to puzzle this one out and wonder if I fully understand what you are looking for, but I'll throw in my two cents anyway.\n\nYou can use the \"girls' and boys'\" example in at least two cases. One would be as in the team the girls are a part of and the team the boys are a part of as separate entities. Most likely because they are segregated by gender and the two groups (the boys and girls) both have their own team, distinct from the other. While in this case you would likely write \"The girls' and boys' teams,\" I have seen it in singular form many times.\n\nThe original example is similarly noted [here](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/compound-possession) as being **compound possession vs separate possession**, that is, two owners of the same thing or two owners of two instances of a thing. The author then also give a counterexample where the object possessed (religious beliefs, in her example) are of the same type, but different instances. Both Hinduism and Christianity are \"religious beliefs\" but distinct from one another.\n\nEchoed [here](https://writingtips.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/possessive-with-two-nouns/), referencing *The Chicago Manual of Style*.\n\nThe second way would be if the writer is referring to two specific groups (known to the reader) of girls and boys that are forming one team. That is: \"The girls' (of class A) and the boys' (of class B) team\" I imagine though that this would be unlikely to be phrased as such and instead would be combined into a plural noun. i.e.: \"The students' team...\" There would also likely be more context before or after the sentence to explain which two groups are the subjects. This is another instance of joint possession, but while unorthodox, could be understood by the reader if they have proper context.\n\nThose might be stretching because there are easier ways to phrase them, but they would probably be understood with foreknowledge."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the phrase \"the girls' and boys' team\", which of the following best explains the use of the apostrophes?\n\nA) It indicates that there are two separate teams, one for girls and one for boys\nB) It shows compound possession, where both girls and boys own the same team\nC) It's a grammatical error and should be written as \"the girl's and boy's team\"\nD) It implies that the girls own the boys who own the team\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. This phrase demonstrates compound possession, where both the girls and boys jointly possess or are part of the same team. The apostrophe after both \"girls\" and \"boys\" indicates that they share ownership or membership of a single team.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if there were two separate teams, it would typically be phrased as \"the girls' and boys' teams\" (plural).\n\nOption C is incorrect because it changes the meaning to singular possessives, which would imply only one girl and one boy.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it misinterprets the possessive structure and creates an illogical ownership hierarchy.\n\nThis question tests understanding of compound possession and the correct use of apostrophes in complex possessive constructions."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/18", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/755747", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/324508/"], "docs_id": 755747, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My PCLinux system occasionally boots to (after login on the regular login screen) two white xterm windows with grey scrollbars on their lefts and NO system buttons (maximize,minimize,etc.) This screen does not have any of the normal KDE buttons, simply two frameless xterm windows on the default desktop background, no menubar, no nothing.

I never used PCLinuxOS or KDE, but here is what I suggest, all of this should work.\n\nFirst install Xfce:\n[http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic\\=105496\\.0](http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=105496.0)\nor, synaptic \\> Settings \\> Repositories \\> Section xfce4\n\nBefore anything else try Xfce by switching your default desktop (log out, and select Xfce before logging in, or change it by whatever interface KDE uses for a login manager)\n\nRemoving KDE is trickier since Synaptic is PART of KDE, so you first need to logout KDE to the terminal. Again, I never used KDE, but as I understand KDE is going to return you to run level 3 upon LOGOFF, which is the single\\-user console. If not, issue the command \"init 3\" as root in the xterm which will most certainly get it done.\n\nThen visit this page which is Ubuntu but both PCLinuxOS and Ubuntu are using the same package managers (apt\\-get). You are also going to read some warnings as well about what you are considering to do. \n[https://askubuntu.com/questions/79636/how\\-to\\-remove\\-all\\-traces\\-of\\-kde\\-installed](https://askubuntu.com/questions/79636/how-to-remove-all-traces-of-kde-installed)\n\nThen in Xfce go to Settings \\> Session and Startup, and make sure the \"Automatically save session on logout\" is ticked, and leave the Xterms open before you log off.

The growth is clearly faster than linear but does not appear to be super-exponential (C), as the ratios between consecutive terms are not increasing dramatically.\n\nThe correct answer is D because:\n\n1) The growth pattern is clearly exponential, as evidenced by the rapidly increasing numbers.\n\n2) The form of growth appears similar to Tutte's formula for spherical triangulations, which is also exponential with some polynomial factors.\n\n3) However, the exact constants are different from those for the sphere, as we would expect for a different genus surface.\n\n4) This aligns with the questioner's hypothesis that for fixed genus g, the growth might be of the form exp(c1*n + c2*log(n) + c3 + o(1)) with constants depending on g.\n\nB is incorrect because while the growth is indeed exponential, there's no evidence from this data alone that it's slower than for spherical triangulations.

I could do it by only having one cluster member per enclosure or rack but that limits me in many other ways than I'm prepared to accept.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well I finally, kind\\-of, sorted this problem \\- not exactly the way I wanted but it's good enough.\n\nBasically vCenter 4\\.1's updated DRS rule system has been upgraded a lot. The new version lets you create groups of hosts and groups of VMs then create one of four different rules against these. The rules are;\n\n* VM members in a named VM group *must* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *should* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *mustn't* run on hosts members in a named host group\n* VM members in a named VM group *shouldn't* run on hosts members in a named host group\n\nNow this is far from the ideal I was looking for which was to have the ability to store the enclosure and/or rack number with the host meta data then define VM groups and apply a rule saying 'spread these VMs as evenly as possible amongst these hosts' \\- but beggars can't be choosers etc.\n\nSo the way I've done it, and this might sound crude but it works and is easy to maintain, was to create a host group called something like 'evens' and another called 'odds' I can then fill these host groups out with hosts that live in racks that are even or odd numbered. For instance all hosts in rack VV041 go into the 'odd's group, whereas hosts in rack 'FF068' go into the 'even's group.\n\nWhat I then did was do the same for VMs', for instance servers 'web01', 'sql1' \\& 'app75' go into the 'odds' VM group and 02's, 24's, 98's etc. go into the 'even's group.\n\nAfter that all you need to do is create two rules, one that says 'odd numbered VMs should live on odd numbered hosts' and vice versa. Expect a vMotion storm if you manually run DRS :)\n\nSo that works ok for me, I have a roughly even balance of VMs across hosts and importantly no two\\-member clusters could ever live in the same enclosure/rack as I'd always name them sequentially (i.e. 01 and 02\\). Does the job and is easy to manage.\n\nHope this helps the 0\\.000002% of IT geeks this addresses :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In vCenter 4.1's updated DRS rule system, which of the following combinations of rule types and group configurations would best achieve the goal of spreading VMs across different blade enclosures or racks for redundancy?\n\nA) Create host groups based on rack numbers (odd/even) and VM groups based on server names (odd/even), then apply a rule stating \"VM members in the odd VM group must run on hosts in the odd host group\"\n\nB) Create host groups based on enclosure IDs and VM groups based on application types, then apply a rule stating \"VM members in each application group should run on hosts in different enclosure groups\"\n\nC) Create host groups based on rack numbers (odd/even) and VM groups based on server names (odd/even), then apply two rules: \"VM members in the odd VM group should run on hosts in the odd host group\" and \"VM members in the even VM group should run on hosts in the even host group\"\n\nD) Create a single host group containing all hosts and a single VM group containing all VMs, then apply a rule stating \"VM members in the VM group must not run on hosts in the same host group\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct answer because it best implements the solution described in the documentation. By creating odd and even groups for both hosts and VMs based on rack numbers and server names, and then applying \"should\" rules (rather than \"must\" rules), this configuration allows DRS to spread VMs across different racks while still maintaining flexibility. This approach ensures that no two-member clusters would live in the same enclosure/rack, as sequential naming (01 and 02) would place them in different groups. The use of \"should\" rules instead of \"must\" rules provides a balance between the desired spread and allowing DRS to make optimal decisions in other scenarios.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses \"must\" rules, which are too restrictive and may prevent DRS from making optimal decisions in certain situations.\n\nOption B is close but doesn't match the specific solution described, which uses odd/even groupings rather than enclosure IDs and application types.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't achieve the goal of spreading VMs across different enclosures or racks, and the rule as stated doesn't make logical sense in the context of DRS."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2023/01/08", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/601115", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/15661/"], "docs_id": 601115, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What\u2019s the origin of *unagreed*?\n\nI can find the word in [*Collin's Dictionary*](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/unagreed), used in [parliamentary publications](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmbeis/1000/100005.htm#:%7E:text=few%20issues%20remain-,unagreed,-upon.%20These%20issues), as well as in [American news articles](https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56536995&itype=CMSID#:%7E:text=illegal%2C%20unconstitutional%2C%20and-,unagreed,-upon%20by%20the).\n\nHowever it's lacking from [*Merriam\\-Webster*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unagreed) and there's no detail about it on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unagreed).\n\nIs this a Britishism that has started leaking across to American publications?

Thanks in advance on guiding a newbie!\n\nIn particular, I am looking forward to some guidance how to:\n\n1. Some sample longitudinal data that would illustrate k\\-means grouping\n2. how to include time dimension into the analysis? Say if I collected 10 days worth of data, capturing long/lat every 5 minutes, I would expect at hour x every day there is a pattern.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of very good references on this matter. Three I can immediately think of are:\n\n1. [Functional clustering and identifying substructures of longitudinal data](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00605.x/pdf) by Chiou and Li (2007\\)\n2. [Clustering for Sparsely Sampled Functional Data](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/fclust.ps) by James and Sugar (2003\\) and\n3. [Distance\\-based clustering of sparsely observed stochastic processes](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1223908052) by Peng and Mueller (2008\\)\n\nFor your particular problem, I would argue (in very short) that instead of doing the $k$\\-means on the data matrix themselves you calculate the principal components of your data (clearly you do this after smoothing and interpolating your data on a common grid). You would then perform the $k$\\-means clustering on the principal components' scores. This two\\-step approach will almost certainly allow you to visualize your data clustering more effectively.\n\nOther approaches (mostly on non\\-parametric clustering) also exist but I think they are an overkill at this point. Jacques and Preda (2013\\) have recently provided an excellent survey on the matter: [Functional data clustering: a survey](http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/77/10/30/PDF/RR-8198.pdf) (I tried to link to author\\-provided reprints where possible)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher has collected longitudinal data on the geographical locations (latitude and longitude) of individuals over a 10-day period, with measurements taken every 5 minutes.

Finally, k-means clustering can be applied to the principal component scores. This two-step approach (PCA followed by clustering) is recommended in the literature for functional data clustering and allows for more effective visualization of the clusters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because applying k-means directly to raw coordinates doesn't account for the temporal nature of the data or potential noise.\n\nOption B oversimplifies the data by using daily averages, losing important temporal information.\n\nOption D, while potentially useful for some movement data, is not the recommended approach for this specific clustering task and doesn't align with the methods discussed in the provided literature.\n\nThe correct answer (C) aligns with the guidance provided in the top answer, which suggests using PCA before clustering for longitudinal data, and is supported by the cited literature on functional data clustering."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/07/25", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/319563", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 319563, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do (1\\) and (2\\) below differ?

In the first sentence, \"Lacking medical education\" implies that the stockbroker's lack of medical knowledge is the reason for their prediction about monkeypox. This suggests that their prediction stems from ignorance. In the second sentence, \"Despite lacking medical education\" indicates that the stockbroker made the prediction even though they lack medical education.

I suspect that 95% of applications do not require it.\n\nwhich is something I strongly disagree with. Maybe I've got the terminology wrong, but for me DI framework means just \"something wiring my objects together\". Am I missing something?\n\nI'm using [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) even for really tiny projects (like 10 classes) in order to *simplify* them. Sure, it's a 400 kB JAR file, but this isn't what I'd care about. For a small project I hardly ever need any configuration and the only \"overhead\" is adding the `@Inject` annotation.\n\nSo I really wonder, what added complexity do DI frameworks cause?\n\n### Update addressing the answers\n\nIn a 82 class project, I have\n\n* 32 `@Inject` annotations\n* 15 `@Singleton` and 1 `@ProvidedBy` annotations\n* 4 Providers (all of which I'd need also without DI as they're my factories)\n* 1 Module containing a single line\n* 0 lines XML !!!\n\nThat's all.

The additional work was a few *words* rather than *lines*.\n\nI'm using solely constructor injection in order to get immutable \"easygoing\" objects. Whenever a new dependency appears, I add a final field, let Lombok's [RequiredArgsConstructor](http://projectlombok.org/features/Constructor.html) take care of the declaration, and let Guice take care of calling it properly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of compromises that are to be made when using DI frameworks as far as I can see.\n\nThe most worrying for me is that your application code is usually spread between a main programming language (like Java) and XML/JSON configuration code (it **is** code). This means that in the case of problems with your application you need to look in two places. Often the configuration code is not easily related to the main application code.\n\nOf course the configuration is also outside the bounds of what the compiler (and often the IDE) can check for you, meaning that it is much easier to make mistakes in this configuration than if you were writing a main class that handled the wiring. In effect this means that wiring issues are pushed from being compile\\-time issues to being runtime issues.\n\nAs well as splitting the application, using DI Frameworks also often mean that you use `@Inject` or similar within your code, instead of traditional DI techniques (CTOR interface injection in Java/C\\+\\+, template injection in C\\+\\+). The downside of this is that you **must** then use a DI framework with the application. An alternative would be to design your application without expecting a DI framework and then allow the DI framework to re\\-use the traditional CTOR/setter injection of your classes.\n\nThe downside to the traditional injection mechanism comes when a complex and properly encapsulation classes demands a number of other relatively complex injections at CTOR time. This is usually solved by incorporating a `Builder`, but it can be a pain.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nThe lads below have mentioned that `Guice` does not need a separate XML/JSON config.

It hums too. \n\nForums discussing transformer hum in amplifiers tend to be populated by audiophiles so I am a little skeptical of the suggestion that it's down to DC offset. I can't find a definite answer one way or another here \\- possibly I don't know the right terms to search for. \n\nIs this right? Could the problem with three humming transformers be that the house supply has DC offset? Is checking it as simple as measuring a wall socket on a DC range?\n\nAnd could this DC offset, in causing the transformers to hum, be accelerating the aging of these transformers making them more likely to hum even if the DC is gone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Step One: Jamming just any sort of multimeter into a wall socket \\= NO! Jamming a reasonably proper one into a wall socket is slightly less no, but they still might not like high voltage AC when set on DC. The normal hobby\\-type multi\\-meters are not for high voltage or high power, way too dangerous.\n\nTo add to it, it means nothing if you do anyway, you may get a reading close to what would be a fair approximation, you may get something way off, nothing is fully guaranteed in DC mode on a normal multimeter. You'll need a true RMS meter to get some real info, or an oscilloscope for good information to act on.\n\n\"Humming\" in a transformer itself can mean many things and even if you think you can \"hear the difference\" between all those, chances are beyond good that actually you can't. The majority of the power in your system is AC at the rated frequency, because that is what's supplied. So the transformer will always hum mostly that frequency.\n\nBut there can be mains contamination that causes it to hum more loudly, this is most likely caused by one or more devices drawing power with a non\\-unity power factor or by clunky old\\-fashioned triac dimmers (especially when dimming \"affordable\" LED lights). It's likely they are in your own house, but it's not guaranteed. Those contaminations can also be periodical, so they may not introduce any DC effect, but run at 2Hz, 100Hz, 500Hz, 10Hz, many kHz, or just occur balanced at the same periodicity as the mains frequency, but with sharp edges. A (much) higher than mains frequency is less likely to have enough power in a mains line to cause a laminated transformer to make any more sound, but it isn't impossible. Either way, measuring it as DC setting will still give 0V if there is any periodicity balanced around 0 that's \"faster\" than the meter's update rate, so DC is a very deceptive term to use here.\n\nA power factor is a number that tells you how neatly the voltage and current signal match each other in phase. If they are exactly equal, i.e. the current is 0 when the voltage is 0 and the current is \\+max at a \\+max voltage, then the power factor is 1\\. When they are out of phase (i.e. the current is \\+max when the voltage is 0\\) the power factor is 0\\. While a power factor of \\-1 would just mean you are supplying energy, i.e. your solar inverter is doing its work: \\-max current at \\+max voltage. \n\nCapacitors and inductors in an AC system will cause the voltage and current to go out of phase, because they can store energy, but one will supply when the other takes, so they can compensate each other when you do the maths right. \n\nThe rules for power factor are quite strict these days, but used to be slightly slack in \"the early days\". Power companies don't like it if you have a low power factor in your house, because it means you are using more current than is registered as power in watts, and that current determines how thick they have to make the cables, while watts determine what you pay. Their transformers will become less efficient at low power factors as well.\n\nI would not be surprised if the autotransformer is a partial or possibly full cause of noise in your mains, they are commonly messy. Basically what you do is:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ecW8L.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fecW8L.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nWhich means you have an inductance L1, that is over\\-dimensioned (to allow you to \"tap\" some power) to move towards transformer effect. The inductance then has an effect on the power factor, but even worse, when loaded it can have all kinds of effects, depending on what your load asks from it.\n\n---\n\nAll that said; overloading also causes excessive humming..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio enthusiast notices that multiple devices with transformers in their home are humming, including an integrated amplifier and an autotransformer.

The foam can disperse either by the bubbles popping as they are exposed to the 'air' above the surface, or by the vapour in the bubble cooling and the bubble collapsing (if the surface of the liquid and surrounding air is below the liquid's boiling point).\n\nBut if it is heated too quickly then the foam doesn't disperse as fast as it collects. New bubbles are trapped below a surface layer of existing foam \\- because they are not exposed to the air they don't pop, and because the foam is a good insulator they don't cool so quickly and therefore don't collapse. Even if foam production is initially only slightly faster than foam dispersion there can be a runaway reaction as the gathering foam has a negative feed\\-back on foam dispersion. \n\nAt he same time, the foam layer now reduces evaporation from the surface of the milk, so it heats faster for the same thermal input from your stove element. The upper surface in particular will heat up rapidly as that was the region that was kept coldest by evaporation before the foam layer started to form. So the foam layer (as well as acting as negative feedback on foam dispersal) also acts as positive feedback on liquid temperature and therefore on foam production rate. \n\nWhen cooking pasta \\- a common 'trick' to stop the pasta water from boiling over in the same way, is to add a teaspoon of oil to the water \\- that stops foam from forming so the feedback effect never starts."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A chef is boiling milk for a recipe and notices it's starting to boil over.

Otherwise, if it's essential information, there needs to be an auxiliary verb.\n\nBut while either of these would correct the conjugation, the meaning would be a little strange:\n\n> \u2754 We, starting early, arrived at noon.  \n> \n>  \u2754 We who were starting early arrived at noon.\n\nEither the first part should be in the past, or the second part in the present or future:\n\n> \u2714 We, **having started** early, arrived at noon.  \n> \n>  \u2714 We, starting early, **would arrive** at noon. \n> \n> \n> \u2714 We **who were starting** early **would arrive** at noon.  \n> \n>  \u2714 We who **had started** early **were arriving** at noon.\n\nNote, too, that in the answer key, using (*starting* / *having started*) only works if *we* is dropped:\n\n> \u2718 **We** starting early, we arrived at noon.  \n> \n>  \u2718 **We** having started early, we arrived at noon.\n\nWithout the *we* both of those sentences become grammatical. However, the first one suffers from the same questionable interpretation of mixed tenses as I mention above. Really (at least in terms of semantics), only the *having started early* construction is both grammatical and explicitly understandable:\n\n> \u2754 Starting early, we arrived at noon.  \n> \n>  \u2714 Having started early, we arrived at noon.\n\n---\n\n> \u2754 The wolf wishing to pick a quarrel with the lamb said, \"How dare you make the water muddy?\"\n\nThis is fine, but, at least stylistically, you should either have a comma after *wolf* and *said*, or you should rephrase it so that it's obviously conveying syntactically necessary information:\n\n> \u2714 The wolf***,*** wishing to pick a quarrel with the lamb***,*** said, \"How dare you make the water muddy?\"  \n> \n>  \u2714 The wolf **who was** wishing to pick a quarrel with the lamb said, \"How dare you make the water muddy?\"\n\nThe second version makes sense if there is more than one wolf, and you're talking about the specific one who is wishing to pick a quarrel."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sentences correctly combines the two given sentences using a participle construction while maintaining proper tense agreement and grammatical structure?\n\nOriginal sentences: We started early.

Its general operation is as follows: We start with a set of quantitative variables whose proportions we want to represent and we use these values to generate a filling pattern (see figure 1\\). These patterns are always similar, we represent each variable by a band whose width is proportional to the value of the variable and we juxtapose all these bands. It is important to note that the total width of the figure (e.g. Band **A** \\+ **B** \\+ **C**) must always be the same size (manualy choosed). It is only the part occupied by each of the different bands that should vary. Figure 1 illustrates what this representation would look like if variable **A** represented 50% of the total, variable **B** 10% and variable **C** 40%.\n\n[![Patern](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SS52.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SS52.png)\n\nThis pattern, must then be applied for each polygon (fig 2\\). As the polygons are not necessarily the same size as the pattern, they are repeated and if they are larger than the pattern, they are cut off (as shown on the right in fig 2\\). The only constraint is that the strips must be aligned vertically to avoid shifts that are painful to read.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UkWK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UkWK.jpg)\n\nI managed to approach this result on a regular mesh using the geometry generator. In this case the size of pattern is the size of polygon (ei. xmax \\_xmin).

A single photon may be emitted when an electron in an atom returns down to the ground state from an excited state. In a reciprocal event, such a photon could be subsequently absorbed by a similar atom causing an electron to jump from the ground state up to the excited state.   \n\nA single photon has a wavefunction associated with it. In the case of emission, the wavefunction suddenly appears in the vicinity of the atom and then radiates out from that source. In the case of absorption, the wavefunction may be initially present over a large volume but is said to suddenly disappear (collapse) at the instant the atom gets excited. Both these events are probabilistic and follow the rules of quantum mechanics.   \n\nIn most cases, physics runs equally well forwards or backwards. Presumably this applies to the emission of a photon by one atom and its absorption by a nearby atom. However the wavefunction description of this process is dramatically asymmetric in time. If I try to run it backwards, I see a wavefunction that abruptly appears in a large volume around one atom and then magically converges towards the other and disappears.   \n\nMaybe is just part of the mystery, but is there no quantum\\-mechanical description of such an event where the description itself has time\\-symmetry?\n\n\\[Edit]   \n\n**Quantum\\-mechanical example with spatial and time symmetry:**   \n\nFor what it's worth, the following picture shows a perfect ellipsoidal cavity with two atoms \\- one at each focus. This is a pathological case, but it does seem like the transfer of the excited state from one atom to the other would involve a time\\-symmetric evolution of the wave function.  \n\n[![symmetry between initialization and measurement?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Emission and absorption of a photon aren't instantaneous processes as long as you don't perturb the system by measuring its state. If you do, the system collapses in a non\\-reversible way. Let me explain how it evolves in the case you don't measure:\n\n### Spontaneous emission\n\nAn atom in the excited state $\\| a \\\\rangle$ emits light in the same spatial pattern as a [classical dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna):   \n\n[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HxfN.png \"Dipole emission pattern, Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg\")](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg)  \n\nAs you correctly state in your question the emission starts out from the position of the atom and moves away from it at the speed of light. Similar to an antenna which is not damped by electrical resistance, but only by the energy it loses due to radiation, the power it emits decays over time. For the case of the atom the state $\\| a, 0 \\\\rangle$ in which the atom is in the excited state and there is no photon present evolves towards the state in which the atom is in the ground state $\\| b \\\\rangle$ and there is a photon in a superposition of many modes with different wavevectors $\\\\vec{k}$. This happens smoothly:\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi (t) \\\\rangle \\= c\\_a (t) \\\\, \\| a, 0 \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\sum\\_{\\\\vec{k}} c\\_{b, \\\\vec{k}} (t) \\\\, \\| b, 1\\_{\\\\vec{k}} \\\\rangle\n$$\nThe temporal evolution is exponential, i.e. $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2 \\= e^{\\- \\\\Gamma t}$, so that after infinite time the atom is completely in the ground state and the photon is completely emitted. For a more rigorous description see the [Wigner\\-Weisskopf theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01336768) as described for example in [Scully \\& Zubairy \u2013 Quantum Optics (1997\\)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511813993) chapter 6\\.3\\.\n\n### Time\\-reversed spontaneous emission\n\nAll of the described evolution happens unitarily, hence it can happen backwards as well as forwards. If you have an atom in the ground state and prepare a photon in a spatial mode matching the emission pattern of the atom having the right temporal profile you can deterministically drive the atom into the excited state. This is described in [Stobi\u0144ska *et al.* EPL **86** (2009\\)](https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/86/14007). It is of course very difficult to do, because you need to focus the light from the full $4 \\\\pi$ solid angle onto the atom and find a way to shape the photon to an exponentially rising wavepacket.\n\n### Absorption of a spread\\-out photon\n\nComing back to the apparent paradox of your question: If the wavefunction of a photon is extended over a large area how does it excite the atom as if it was localized there? The answer is \"It doesn't.\". Like in the case of spontaneous emission the state of the overall system evolves in a superposition of the atom being in the ground state / the photon flying around and the atom being excited by the photon. Just that in the case of a photon not matching the spatio\\-temporal radiation pattern of the atom the probability of the atom being excited $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2$ is very low. So the majority of the wavefunction still describes a free\\-flying photon.\n\nOnly when you measure the state of the atom (or the presence of the photon) you force the system to be in either of the states. This is the moment when the whole spread\\-out photon collapses to be either absorbed or detected somewhere on a camera. The whole mystery is in the description of collapse due to measurement. But this is another topic, covered in questions like \"[Practically, how does an 'observer' collapse a wave function?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/509803/169454)\".\n\n### Is the absorption also a measurement?\n\nThere is a connection between the (partial) absorption of the photon and a projective measurement. By their interaction the atom and the photon become entangled, just like in more advanced collapse models the detector becomes entangled with the observed system. As an example consider an animal\\-friendly version of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat: A radioactive atom, which can trigger a detector and an experimentalist monitoring the detector. If the atom was alone it would evolve into a superposition of decayed and not decayed\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nIf you include the detector into the Hilbert space you can model the system of detector plus atom as an entangled state\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nInvolving the experimentalist as well then yields the state\n$$\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\|\\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector \\+ experimentalist}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\quad \\&\\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\n\\+ \\&\\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{no decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n\\\\end{align}\n$$\nBecause the experimentalist is part of the superposition, in each branch of the wavefunction it appears to the experimentalist as if the atom is now in a definite state \u2013 as if it had collapsed from the initial superposition.\n\nSo in the end the distinction between the atom and a macroscopic detector is artificial. But it's justified, because the atom can be coherently manipulated to unentangle it from the photon. For macroscopic systems like the detector (and experimentalist) this is pretty hopeless because they have too many degrees of freedom.\n\n### Absorption of a focused photon\n\nIn the case of the elliptic cavity the emission of atom $A$ is indeed reshaped to match the spatial emission pattern of atom $B$. Despite this the probability that atom $B$ absorbs the photon is still less than $1$, because the temporal profile of the emitted photon is exponentially decaying, while perfect absorption (time\\-reversed spontaneous emission) requires an exponentially rising profile.   \n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIP7N.png)   \n\nIf the cavity size is reduced such that the emission of the photon takes significatly longer than a round\\-trip of in the cavity, the excitation being initially in atom $A$ can be fully transfered to atom $B$ and vice versa.\n\nThe following is a simulation starting in the state\n$$\n\\| a\\_A \\\\rangle \\| b\\_B \\\\rangle \\| 0 \\\\rangle \\\\text{,}\n$$\ni.e. atom $A$ in the excited state, $B$ in the ground state and $0$ photons in the cavity.

This occurs because the system is in a closed cavity where the photon can be repeatedly absorbed and emitted by both atoms.

A Windows and Linux user before, I'm now getting quite used to the differences with using Apple's desktop environment.\n\nOne thing that is still slowing me down a little is the requirement to explicitly click in an application window to make it active, before the UI elements inside that window can be interacted with.\n\nFor example, if I have two browser windows open side by side with the left one active, it takes two clicks to follow a link in the right hand window: one to make the window active, one to click the link.\n\nThis is in contrast to Windows or Linux, where you can click on a UI element in a inactive window and that single click will both activate the window and the element in it.\n\nA similar issue is trying to copy and paste text between windows. I can select and copy text in an active terminal or editor, then paste it into another with 'right\\-click, Paste' but that doesn't activate the window. I still need to left\\-click the window to activate it before I can type into it.\n\nIn Windows and Linux, the right\\-click to paste would also activate the window. If I was pasting a command into a terminal, I could then just hit Enter to run it, whereas an extra mouse click is required on my Mac. This feels a little cumbersome.\n\nCan this behaviour be adjusted to resemble Windows and Linux?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer, in general, is \"no\". There are some exceptions/workarounds though, for example: \n\n* You can click through to any control in an unfocused window using Cmd\\-Click. This will directly operate that control without focusing the window, which might save you a click in your side\\-by\\-side browser window scenario. Unfortunately it's up to each application developer to make this work sensibly, and some unfocused applications will still perform any special action assigned to Cmd\\-Click, rather than treating it as a simple click.\n* In Terminal.app, Cmd\\-Right Click will paste the contents of the primary selection (the last text you highlighted in any terminal window) into the same or another terminal, whether that terminal is focused or not.\n* Specifically for X11 applications running under XQuartz.app (which isn't very many these days), you can specify the \"focus follow mouse\" option so that X11 windows are focused as you mouse over them. (There also used be a [hidden focus\\-follows\\-mouse option](http://osxdaily.com/2011/04/18/terminal-focus-follow-mouse-mac/) for Terminal.app windows, don't know if it still works in El Capitan or Sierra.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: On a MacBook Pro, which of the following methods allows you to interact with a UI element in an inactive window without first clicking to activate that window?\n\nA) Right-clicking on the UI element\nB) Shift-clicking on the UI element\nC) Cmd-clicking on the UI element\nD) Alt-clicking on the UI element\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C) Cmd-clicking on the UI element.

As described in the documentation, for a simplex $\\sigma$ where the cone point appears at vertices with indices greater than $k$, the map sends $\\sigma$ to a degenerate simplex $s_{n-1} \\cdots s_{k+2} s_{k+1} \\tau$ if and only if $k < n$.\nD is incorrect because, as stated in the last sentence of the documentation, this map definition works for $M^{\\otimes}$ being any quasicategory, not just correspondences between operads."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/19", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269510", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/143137/"], "docs_id": 269510, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The hyperlinks in Notes on macOS are essentially yellow on white, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n[![Default Hyperlink Color in macOS Notes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YK9A.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YK9A.png)\n\nI would like to change the color to any darker color to improve the contrast, but how? I have tried to highlight hyperlinks to change their color, but the color remains the same even after selecting a color for them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As someone who's done a lot of UX (user experience) work over the years, I have to admit I was very surprised when I first saw the hyperlink colour in Apple's Notes app. Not so surprised that someone would actually propose it, but very surprised it passed through all the review processes at Apple.\n\nAnyway, I do have a couple of workaround options that *may* help you until Apple addresses this, as I fully expect they will at some point. These options are far from perfect, but if the default hyperlink colour is enough of an issue, they are worth considering.\n\n**Hyperlinks displaying the actual URL**\n\nIf your hyperlink text displays the actual URL (e.g. \"apple.stackexchange.com\" instead of \"Ask Different\") you can do this:\n\n1. Right\\-click on the yellow link\n2. From the context menu, select *Remove Link*\n\nYou will notice that the link text now changes to black\\* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double\\-click) and then right\\-clicking to select the *Open URL* option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.\n\n\\*If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with *http:* etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link. \n\n**Hyperlinks displaying words**\n\nIf your hyperlink text displays words instead of an actual URL (e.g. \"Ask Different\" instead of \"apple.stackexchange.com\") you can do this:\n\n1. Right\\-click on the yellow link\n2. From the context menu, select *Edit Link...*\n3. This will open up the Link Destination window with the full URL already selected. Copy (`command``C`) or cut (`command``X`) the link and click on the OK button.\n4. In your note, Paste (`command``V`) the URL over the original hyperlink text\n5. Right\\-click on what is still a yellow link\n6. From the context menu, select *Remove Link*\n\nOnce again you will notice that the link text now changes to black\\* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double\\-click) and then right\\-clicking to select the *Open URL* option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.\n\n\\*If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with *http:* etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the Apple Notes app on macOS, what is a viable workaround to change the color of hyperlinks that display words instead of URLs (e.g., \"Ask Different\" instead of \"apple.stackexchange.com\")?\n\nA) Highlight the hyperlink text and select a different color from the text formatting options.\nB) Right-click the hyperlink, select \"Edit Link...\", copy the URL, paste it over the original text, then remove the link and manually change the text color.\nC) Go to System Preferences and adjust the default hyperlink color for all applications.\nD) Use a third-party plugin to modify the appearance of hyperlinks in the Notes app.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, this method allows users to change the appearance of hyperlinks in the Apple Notes app when the link text displays words instead of URLs. The process involves editing the link, replacing the text with the actual URL, removing the link formatting, and then manually changing the text color. This workaround addresses the issue of poor contrast with the default yellow hyperlink color.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation states that simply highlighting and changing the color doesn't work for hyperlinks in the Notes app. Option C is not mentioned as a possibility in the given information, and macOS doesn't typically offer system-wide hyperlink color changes. Option D, while plausible, is not mentioned in the provided documentation and would not be an official solution."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/04", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/139255", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/42297/"], "docs_id": 139255, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I refer [Magento 2 \\- Export/Import Product Attributes](https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/104399/magento-2-export-import-product-attributes) but no one answered :(\n\nI have already created new Attribute Set \\& it's Attributes.

It doesn't make sense.\n2. The factory that should instantiate the object will throw a \"circular dependency\" exception.\n\nI'll start with the second point.  \n\nIf you do it like that, when you try to instantiate your helper, the dependency injection container (DIC) will look for an instance of your class to pass it to your class constructor.  \n\nBut that class instance does not exist, so DIC will try to instantiate it and you are back at the previous step. \n\nAnd here is why it doesn't make sense.  \n\nYou would need a dependency on your class because you need to call a method from that dependency, but you can already call methods from your class inside your class. You don't need an other instance to call methods from that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 2, a developer is attempting to export a newly created Attribute Set and its Attributes from a local environment to a server.

The documentation indicates that there is no straightforward method to export only a specific Attribute Set and its Attributes in Magento 2 without involving the entire product catalog or database. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Magento's default Import/Export functionality exists for Products, it deals with all products and not just specific Attribute Sets.\n\nOption B is misleading. Although the question asks about managing through CSV or custom code, there's no indication in the documentation that this is possible for isolated Attribute Sets without affecting the whole catalog.\n\nOption C is incorrect and addresses a different issue.
