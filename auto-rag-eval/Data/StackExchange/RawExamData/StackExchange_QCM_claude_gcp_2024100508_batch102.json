Is it during take\\-off, landing or during (light/moderate/severe) turbulence? \n\nWith \"stress\" I mean the load applied to the aircraft structure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Landing \\- stress is highest on the pilot, because he/she can't afford to be too fast/too slow, or too high/too low.\n\nTakeoff \\- stress is highest on the engines. They are at full power and have to hoist a heavy aircraft as high as possible in as short a time as possible.\n\nCruise \\- stress is highest on the airframe when encountering up/down drafts at cruising speed (bumpy air).\nLook at it this way, every plane in level flight, for a specific weight and configuration (flaps, etc.) has a *stall speed*. That is the slowest speed at which it can support its own weight.\nIf it is going twice that speed, it can support four times its own weight (and the passengers will feel 4G, and it can go negative as well).\nIf it is going three times that speed, in principal its wings could support nine times its own weight *if they were strong enough*.\nTypically they are not strong enough, and they will break instead, if they encounter a strong enough updraft or downdraft.\nThat is why every aircraft has a particular speed, a fairly low speed, called \"maneuvering speed\", that they slow down to if they stupidly stumble into a storm cell.\nAt that speed, there is no amount of up or down draft that can cause structural damage.\nTechnically, it's the speed at which maximum control deflections cannot cause structural damage. Remember the accident in Far Rockaway NY?\nThe pilot tore off the tail fin by stomping the rudder pedals too hard from one side to the other.\n\nBy contrast, military fighters and aerobatic stunt planes are built for high\\-G turns (12G is possible).\nYou can see, since available lift is proportional to velocity squared, it is not at all difficult to go fast enough to get that kind of lift.\n\nAlso, don't forget a jetliner is a pressurized air bottle, for high\\-altitude flight with passenger comfort.\nIt cycles from un\\-pressurized to pressurized every time it climbs to cruise altitude and back.\nThis has been known to cause metal fatigue cracks, resulting in some accidents."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An aircraft engineer is analyzing the stress factors on a commercial airliner during different phases of flight. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the highest stress on various components of the aircraft?\n\nA) The airframe experiences the highest stress during takeoff due to the rapid increase in altitude.\nB) The engines undergo the most stress during cruise, especially when encountering turbulence.\nC) The wings experience the highest stress during landing due to the sudden deceleration and ground impact.\nD) The airframe faces the highest stress during cruise when encountering strong updrafts or downdrafts at high speeds.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The airframe experiences the highest stress during cruise, particularly when encountering strong updrafts or downdrafts at high speeds. This is because the lift force is proportional to the square of the aircraft's velocity. At cruising speeds, sudden vertical air movements can generate forces that approach or exceed the structural limits of the airframe.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while takeoff does put stress on the aircraft, it's primarily on the engines rather than the airframe.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the engines are under the highest stress during takeoff, not cruise.\n\nOption C is inaccurate because although landing does stress the landing gear and structure, it doesn't typically produce the highest overall stress on the wings or airframe compared to high-speed encounters with turbulence during cruise.\n\nThis question tests understanding of aerodynamic forces, flight phases, and structural limitations of aircraft."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/18", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/26130", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/12115/"], "docs_id": 26130, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a house with a sunroom heated by a Vermont Castings gas stove with a problem the HVAC/stove repair person hasn't solved by replacing the thermocouple, valve($$$) and taking apart and cleaning.

In fact it's very common, especially when wiring ceiling fans. The power (2 wire /w ground) enters the switch box, then a switched hot and unswitched hot are supplied to the fan (3 wire /w ground). This allows the light to be toggled by the wall switch, while the fan is toggled by the switch on the fixture. It's also a common practice to wire duplex receptacles this way, where one half of the device is always powered and the other half is controlled by a switch (in which case the tab separating the two halves should be removed on the ungrounded (hot) side). \n\nThe grounded (neutral) conductor will carry the combined current of the two ungrounded (hot) conductors, so any inductive coupling will still be canceled out. Since the circuit is protected by an overcurrent device (circuit breaker/fuse), there is no way to overload the grounded (neutral) conductor.

I will be using this network to connect several (4\\-6\\) computers together in a typical (geek) home setting. \n\nI have worked out the topology and most of the components, but there is one I am stuck on: the sockets. The quote I received from the electrician includes Cat 7 cables (probably overkill, but the difference in price to Cat 6 was minimal) and Cat 5 (RJ\\-45\\) sockets. I have a fairly good handle on Cat 5 / 6 / 7 cables, but the sockets have me stumped:\n\n* What does the Category (Cat) of an Ethernet socket signify?\n* If I connect Cat 5 sockets to Cat 7 cables, will I be limited to \"Cat 5\" speeds? Is the difference even likely to be noticeable in a home network?\n* My electrician claims that Cat 6 or Cat 7 sockets are very rare and almost never used. Is this the case? Some Googling has turned up the [GG45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GG45) socket, which seems to be a backwards\\-compatible (with RJ\\-45\\) socket for Cat 7 cables \\- is this what I should be looking for? Or can I replace my Cat 5 sockets with Cat 7 sockets at a later date?\n\nI'm still trying to get my head around this, so I apologise for the somewhat confusing questions, and would be most grateful if anyone can point me onto the correct path! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cat7 connectors are compatible with Cat5, with enhancements and caveats\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCat5, Cat5e, Cat6 and Cat7 are physically and electrically compatible. It's when you try to do 10Gb/s or higher signaling on the cable that the Cat5e standard falls over. Even at that, though, Cat5e will do 10Gbps out to 150 feet.\n\nThe physical connectors for Cat6 and Cat7 cables are still RJ45 plugs, but they're shielded and the standard calls for much less untwisting at the ends of the cable in the connectors than what is permissible for Cat5e. It's \"harder\" to do a proper Cat6 or Cat7 termination.\n\nAside from the wire twist requirements, in order for shielded connectors to work as designed, the grounding conductor in the cable has to be permanently in contact with the metal shield on the plug or jack when it is connected to the cable. You'll also see shielded Cat5e in installations like outdoor radio connections. Properly shielded cables also open up a whole new realm of potential issues like ground loop interference, so all of your equipment needs to be properly grounded, as well.\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nAnyhow... if you connect your Cat7 cable to Cat5e jacks, presuming your Cat5e jacks let you jam the thicker Cat7 wires in (which they *almost* certainly will), you can expect Cat5e performance. Cat5e performance is 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet, or about 125 Megabytes per second). Properly terminated Cat5e will handle 10Gbps out to 150 feet, and Cat6 will handle 10Gbps out to 180 feet. Cat6 is often more than a job calls for, and costs twice as much.\n\nJust for reference, if you have a mechanical hard drive in your computer, it's going to struggle to push more than 120 Megabytes per second. Gigabit Ethernet is every bit as fast as your internal hard drive throughput. If you have an SATA SSD, you may see 500 Megabytes per second, which is \"faster\" than Gigabit Ethernet. With the right switch, you can aggregate ports to create a 2 Gb/s, 3Gb/s, 4Gb/s or faster channel, but any single copy operation will only be able to saturate one of those aggregated links. If you have a PCI express SSD, it may be able to push over a Gigabyte per second, at which point you would need a 10Gbps network to come close to supporting the full throughput of that drive. But in practice, it's rare that you would need that kind of throughput over the network. A RAID built out of PCI express SSD's will support an absurd amount of throughput, at which point you would need to aggregate multiple 10Gbps links to fully support the throughput of the RAID array. But you don't need anything like that unless you're a big datacenter with big SANs and heavy virtualized workloads.\n\nPersonally, just to future\\-proof, I would consider running at least 2 Cat6 or Cat7 cables to every room if I was pulling new cable. But the chances of ever actually needing all that bandwidth are pretty low.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10Gbps Ethernet still costs over $100 per port right now, which is expensive for home use (you could get an 8 port 10Gbps switch for about $850\\).\n\nIt's unlikely that you need bigger bandwidth at your house than what Gigabit Ethernet provides today. On the other hand, I'd check the cost of Cat6 or Cat7 jacks and if you can bear the extra cost, have those installed instead of the Cat5e jacks.\n\nBear in mind that if your installer doesn't terminate those Cat6 or Cat7 jacks correctly (properly bonding the grounding conductor in the cable to the shielding, wire twist rules, etc.), then they aren't really Cat6/7 jacks, anyway. Your installer might know this, and might not want to go to the extra trouble if terminating those cables in full compliance with the standard.\n\nFuture of copper Ethernet\n-------------------------\n\nBy the way, copper network cable has plenty of life ahead of it, out to 50 Gb/s or 100 Gb/s (well over 10 Gigabytes per second), depending on the standard and the cable. Ethernet over optical fiber follows essentially the same roadmap\\-\\-same speeds\\-\\-running out for several years, then jumps to bandwidth like 400Gb/s and higher. Who knows if copper will continue to support those kinds of speeds. But are you really worried about being able to move so much data around your home network that 50Gb/s or 100Gb/s couldn't meet your needs? So you can install fiber if you really want to, but you're going to pay a lot more for every port for a zero or negligible benefit if you go that route.\n\n**Having said all that, I actually do strongly agree with the notion of running conduit so that you can pull new cable later**. Because who knows what's really coming a few years out? One reasonable way to do this is to run the conduits straight up the wall channel from the wall boxes into the attic. You can pull cable straight up into the attic, then run it through the attic suspended from the roof trusses or even strung across the joists.\n\nBut in terms of future\\-proofing, take a look at the [Ethernet Roadmap document from the Ethernet Alliance](http://www.ethernetalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ethernet-Roadmap-2sides-Final-5Mar.pdf)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: You are planning to install Ethernet wiring in your home and have received a quote for Cat 7 cables with Cat 5 (RJ-45) sockets. Which of the following statements is true regarding this setup?\n\nA) The network will be limited to Cat 5 speeds due to the Cat 5 sockets, significantly reducing performance compared to Cat 7 capabilities.\n\nB) Cat 7 sockets are necessary to achieve the full potential of Cat 7 cables, and using Cat 5 sockets will render the Cat 7 cables useless.\n\nC) The network will likely perform at Cat 5e speeds (1000 Mb/s or Gigabit Ethernet), which is sufficient for most home networking needs.\n\nD) Cat 7 cables are incompatible with Cat 5 sockets and will not function at all in this configuration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat7 are physically and electrically compatible. When connecting Cat7 cables to Cat5e jacks, you can expect Cat5e performance, which is 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet). This speed is sufficient for most home networking needs, as it matches or exceeds the throughput of typical hard drives and is adequate for most home applications. While the setup doesn't take full advantage of Cat7 capabilities, it still provides high-speed networking that meets the requirements of a typical home network.

I'm using SVM with RBF kernel. \nSince I'm doing a ten 10 cross\\-validation to report precision,recall, do I perform this grid search in the training data of each holdout (there are 10 holdouts, each having 10% test and 90% training data) ? Wouldn't that be too time consuming ? \n\nIf I use the gamma and C of the first holdout and use it for the rest of 9 holdouts of the k\\-fold cross\\-validation, is that a violation because I would have used the train data to get gamma and C and again use the portion of train data as test in second holdout ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, this would be a violation as the test data for folds 2\\-10 of the outer cross\\-validation would have been part of the training data for fold 1 which were used to determine the values of the kernel and regularisation parameters. This means that some information about the test data has potentially leaked into the design of the model, which potentially gives an optimistic bias to the performance evaluation, that is most optimistic for models that are very sensitive to the setting of the hyper\\-parameters (i.e. it most stongly favours models with an undesirable feature).\n\nThis bias is likely to be strongest for small datasets, such as this one, as the variance of the model selection criterion is largest for small datasets, which encourages over\\-fitting the model selection criterion, which means more information about the test data can leak through.\n\nI wrote a paper on this a year or two ago as I was rather startled by the magnitude of the bias deviations from full nested cross\\-validation can introduce, which can easily swamp the difference in performance between classifier systems.

If you follow that rule, you probably can't go too far wrong.

This ensures that hyperparameter tuning is treated as an integral part of the model fitting process for each fold, preventing information leakage between folds and avoiding bias in performance evaluation.\n\nOption A would introduce bias because the test data in folds 2-10 would have been part of the training data used to determine hyperparameters in fold 1, potentially leading to optimistic performance estimates.\n\nOption C, while time-efficient, would not optimize the model's performance and might lead to suboptimal results.\n\nOption D would cause significant data leakage, as the entire dataset (including what will become test data in each fold) would influence the hyperparameter selection, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n\nThe correct approach, though computationally expensive, is necessary to obtain unbiased performance estimates, especially for small datasets where the risk of overfitting during model selection is higher."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/26", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/491623", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/166537/"], "docs_id": 491623, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Running into an issue using two VM's running REL6\\.

You had copper wires from a premise (office or home) to an exchange (initially manual, then automated), wires from exchange to exchange (possibly several), and again wires from the last exchange to the destination premises. Beyond some amplification and other treatments such as noise filtering or echo cancellation, it was the same original analog signal that was sent all the way through.\n\nNote that when you used modems, you sent a digital signal as analog, and it had to deal with the bad quality of an analog link and all the complications introduced by the systems that were meant to optimise voice, but could be a problem for digital.\n* then, in the core of the network, the links between the exchanges were replaced with digital links. The exchanges at both ends performed analog\\-to\\-digital and digital\\-to\\-analog conversion. The link between the user premises and the exchange was still analog, while in between the links were converted to digital.\n* ISDN is the extension of that digital conversion to the end\\-user premises. Use the same copper wires, but transmit digital signals on them, not analog. Digital/analog conversion is done on premises (depending on the exact architecture, it may be done by several different pieces of equipment).\n* the low\\-level technology of ISDN is DSL, by definition a \"Digital Subscriber Line\". BRI (T0\\) used very low speed DSL (144\\-160 kbit/s IIRC). PRI (T1/T2\\) higher speeds (1\\.5\\-2 Mbps). PRIs initially used special cabling (thicker wires, more shielding), but that was then replaced with SDSL which uses the old regular thin copper wiring that was original used for phone service.\n\nHowever, contrary to modern xDSL services, the core circuit\\-switched network of PSTN was still used. Yes, there was a little bit of packet\\-switched data possible on the D channel, but that remains minimal.\n* Further improvements to xDSL were introduced, including ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2\\+, VDSL, VDSL2\\... The principle is still the same: use the existing copper wiring (often decades old) between exchanges and customer premises, but with higher and higher speeds. The difference however is that instead of carrying (mostly) voice over switched circuits (the base of PSTN), data is carried which is packet\\-switched (IP) or cell\\-switched (back in the days of long\\-distance ATM).\n\nSo:\n\nPSTN \\= premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring \\+ circuit\\-switched exchange\\-to\\-exchange network.\n\nPOTS \\= analog voice service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring.\n\nISDN \\= digital service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring. Still using circuit\\-switched network.\n\nMost xDSL technologies: digital service over the premises\\-to\\-exchange wiring, packet\\-switched network.\n\n```\nTech | End-user/Exchange | Long-distance network\n-----+-------------------+--------------------------\nPOTS | Analog            | Analog, circuit-switched\nPOTS | Analog            | Digital, circuit-switched\nISDN | Digital           | Digital, circuit-switched\nxDSL | Digital           | Digital, packet-switched\n\nPSTN = End-user/Exchange wiring + circuit-switched network.\n\n```\n\nTo answer your questions more specifically:\n\n* **How significant is PSTN today?** It's still used for all voice calls to/from a landline, and even mobile calls are mostly routed through the core of the PSTN\n* **How significant is POTS today?** Nearly all consumer landlines are POTS. Medium and large business use ISDN or VoIP. Some consumer landlines use VoIP (if you connect your phone to the back of your DSL or cable box it's VoIP).\n* **Is ISDN any relevant today?** For data (which was one of the primary selling points for ISDN in the consumer/SoHo market), it's probably as good as dead. For voice, it's used for medium/large businesses which haven't switched to VoIP yet.\n* **How significant is the PSTN today for internet connections?** Very very marginal.\n* **How significant is the PSTN today for telephone?** Still the backbone of the telephone system.\n* **Doesn't DSL use the PSTN?** Modern xDSL technologies use the \"last\\-mile\" part of the PSTN, the exchange\\-to\\-premises copper wiring, to carry data. But instead of having the line connected to a telephone exchange that does circuit\\-switching, it is connected to a modem in a DSLAM which is then connected (directly or indirectly) to the Internet."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the evolution of telecommunication technologies?\n\nA) POTS uses digital signaling between the user premises and the exchange, while ISDN uses analog signaling.\n\nB) ISDN was developed to replace packet-switched networks with circuit-switched networks for improved data transmission.\n\nC) Modern xDSL technologies utilize the existing copper wiring of PSTN's \"last-mile\" but connect to packet-switched networks instead of circuit-switched exchanges.\n\nD) PSTN is no longer significant for voice calls, as all landline and mobile calls now use VoIP technology exclusively.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately describes how modern xDSL technologies have evolved.

I won't speak too much to your power supply issue, but really think you should invest in a UPS to mitigate any power related damages to your equipment.\n\nNow lets correct a few mistakes in the previous answer. \n\nThe 120VAC legs of your electrical service are supplied by two separate hot feeds from the power company. The neutral is not there to split the 220VAC, but rather to supply a return path to the service panel and ultimately earth ground. \n\nThe neutral should be at the same potential as ground. An open neutral is checked by measuring neutral to ground, if line voltage appears, then in fact the neutral path to ground is open. Unless you have a situation where both 120VAC legs are in contact with one hot connection, you cannot produce more than 120VAC on any open neutral. If you were to see 140VAC on any hot to ground or neutral, or neutral to ground, then you have some serious problems and time to call the landlord before you fry all your lights, appliances, and electronics. This situation is very rare, and I don't think it is your problem. Your problem sounds more like a bad connection, either hot or neutral in some device that feeds your downstairs outlets. \n\nThis can be a frustrating and time consuming job to track down this type of problem. It may involve pulling several devices out of the boxes and testing voltages with the power on, and also testing conductivity with the POWER OFF.

In this case we can solve the Schrodinger equation analytically and we get the well known $1s$, $2s$, etc functions. Although these are often referred to as *orbitals* they are actually the *wavefunctions* that the single electron can have. For more on this read Emilio's answer to [What do atomic orbitals represent in quantum mechanics?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/607552/what-do-atomic-orbitals-represent-in-quantum-mechanics/607654#607654) As wavefunctions these have well defined properties associated with them e.g. $\\|\\\\psi\\_{1s}\\|^2$ gives us the probability distribution for the $1s$ state, and the energy of the $1s$ orbital is:\n\n$$ E\\_{1s} \\\\psi\\_{1s} \\= H \\\\psi\\_{1s} $$\n\nThis energy is the total energy of the atom i.e. of the electron\\-nucleus system. You can split it into kinetic, $T$, and potential, $V$, energy parts and you'll find it obeys the virial theorem $\\-2T \\= V$. So far so good.\n\nThe problem is that with more than one electron we have forces acting between electrons as well as forces between the electrons and the nucleus. The forces between electrons mean the force is no longer central, and they entangle all the electrons so we cannot write the wavefunction as a product of separate functions for each electron. Instead we get a single wavefunction $\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r\\_1, \\\\mathbf r\\_2, \\\\cdots, \\\\mathbf r\\_n)$, where $\\\\mathbf r\\_i$ is the position of the $i$th electron, and the energy we get from this wavefunction is the total energy of the whole system of the nucleus and all $n$ electrons. Since the electrons are all entangled individual electrons do not have a well defined energy or a well defined probability distribution. We can find only the total energy and total electron probability distribution in the atom.\n\nBut it turns out that the interactions between pairs of electrons can be averaged out to produce an approximately central force, and using this approximation we can divide our total wavefunction into separate wavefunctions for each electron. So for lithium we could write:\n\n$$ \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r\\_1, \\\\mathbf r\\_2, \\\\mathbf r\\_3\\) \\\\approx \\\\psi\\_{1s\u2191} \\~ \\\\psi\\_{1s\u2193} \\~ \\\\psi\\_{2s\u2191} $$\n\nAnd these functions $\\\\psi\\_{1s\u2191}$ etc are the *atomic orbitals*.\n\nEach orbital has an energy and an electron density associated with them, but these are not the energy and probability distribution of that electron because as we discussed above the electrons are all entangled and cannot be described separately.

Read on...\n\nNote:\n-----\n\nAs my understanding of this problem has evolved, so has this question. As a result the question itself is similar but the code example and underlying details/reasoning in the following body of text have changed significantly since the question was first asked.\n\n### Context\n\nI have an incredibly basic application (code at the bottom) that draws a single elipses in the drawRect: method of a custom UIView. The application demonstrates the difference in performance when the size of the elipses being drawn remains the same but the size of the custom UIView gets larger:\n\n![Small UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeyrI.png)\n\n![Large UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RdFE.png)\n\nI ran the application on both an iPod 4th Gen running iOS 4\\.3\\.5 and an iPad 1st Gen running iOS 5\\.1\\.1 a series of times using custom UIViews of different sizes.  \n\nThe following table displays the results taken from the time profiler instrument:\n\n![Time profiler results](https://i.stack.imgur.com/53aLc.png)\n\nThe following instrument traces display the details of the two extremes for each device:\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9aUSA.png)\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HL6WF.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhWR0.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JweVL.png)\n\nAs you can (*hopefully*) see in 3 out of the 4 cases we get what we'd expect: the majority of time was spent performing the custom UIViews drawRect: method and each held 10fps.  \n\nBut the forth case shows a plumet in performance with the application struggling to hold 7fps while only drawing a single shape. The majority of time was spent copying memory during the UIView's CALayer's display method, specifically:\n\n\\[CALayer display] \\>  \n\n\\[CALayer \\_display] \\>  \n\nCABackingStoreUpdate \\>  \n\nCA::Render::ShmemBitmap::copy\\_pixels(CA::Render::ShmemBitmap const\\*, CGSRegionObject\\*) \\>  \n\nmemcpy$VARIANT$CortexA8\n\nNow it doesn't take a genius to see from the figures that something seriously wrong here. With a custom UIView of size 960 x 1380, iOS 4\\.3\\.5 spends over 4 times the amount of time copying memory around than it does drawing the entire view's contents.\n\n### Question\n\nNow, given the context, I ask my question again:\n\n**Why, on iOS 4\\.3\\.5, do 'large' (960 x 1380\\) custom UIView's perform CABackingStoreUpdate so inefficiently and how can I improve the performance of drawing operations?**\n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nI have also posted this question on the [Apple Developer forums](https://devforums.apple.com/message/791651#791651).\n\n### The Real Deal\n\nNow, obviously, I've reduced my real problem to the simplest reproducible case for the sake of this question. I'm actually attempting to animate a portion of a 960 x 1380 custom UIView that sits inside a UIScrollView.\n\nWhilst I appreciate the temptation to steer anyone towards OpenGL ES when they're not achieving the level of performance they want through Quartz 2D I ask that anyone that takes that route at least offer an explanation as to why Quartz 2D is struggling to perform even the most basic of drawing operations on iOS 4\\.3\\.5 where iOS 5\\.1\\.1 has no problem. As you can imagine I'm not thrilled about the idea of re\\-writing everything for this cornerstone case.\nThis also applies for people suggesting using Core Animation. Although I've used an elipses changing colour (a task perfectly suited for Core Animation) in the demo for the sake of simplicity, the drawing operations I'd actual like to perform are a large quantity of lines expanding over time, a drawing task Quartz 2D is ideal for (when it is performant!). Plus, again, this would require a re\\-write and doesn't help explain this odd performance problem.\n\n### Code\n\n> TViewController.m (Implementation of a standard view controller)\n\n```\n#import \"TViewController.h\"\n#import \"TCustomView.h\"\n\n// VERSION 1 features the custom UIView the same size as the screen.\n// VERSION 2 features the custom UIView nine times the size of the screen.\n#define VERSION 2\n\n@interface TViewController ()\n@property (strong, nonatomic) TCustomView *customView;\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSTimer *animationTimer;\n@end\n\n@implementation TViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    // Custom subview.\n    TCustomView *customView = [[TCustomView alloc] init];\n    customView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\n#if VERSION == 1\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 460.0f);\n#else\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 960.0f, 1380.0f);\n#endif\n\n    [self.view addSubview:customView];\n\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *singleTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];\n    [customView addGestureRecognizer:singleTap];\n\n    self.customView = customView;\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapGesture\n{\n    self.customView.value = 0.0f;\n\n    if (!self.animationTimer  || !self.animationTimer.isValid) {\n        self.animationTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.1 target:self selector:@selector(animationLoop) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];\n    }\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)animationLoop\n{\n    // Update model here.

Originally 1024x1024 was the maximum size a UIView could be, and whilst this restriction has since been lifted it is entirely likely that views larger than this only became efficient in iOS5 and later.\n\nI'd conjecture that the excess memory copying you are seeing in iOS4 is due to UIKit using a full size memory buffer for the large UIView, but then having to copy appropriate sized tiles of it before they can be composited; and that in iOS5 and later they've either removed any restriction on the size of the tiles that can be composited, or changed the way UIKit renders for such large UIViews.\n\nIn terms of working around this bottleneck on iOS4 you can try tiling the area you want to cover with smaller UIViews. If you structure it as:\n\n```\n\n  Parent View - contains drawing and event related code\n    Tile View 1 - contains drawRect\n    ...\n    Tile View n - contains drawRect\n\n```\n\nIn each tile view, you can ask the parent view to render its contents after adjusting the graphics context's transform appropriately. This means you don't have to change the drawing code, it will just be invoked multiple times (there is a small overhead for this, but remember each invocation will be drawing only a portion of the whole view).\n\nNote that its important that the parent view does not have a drawRect method \\- otherwise UIKit will think you want to draw into it directly and it will create a backing store thus putting you back in the same situation.\n\nThere is also CATiledLayer that you could look into \\- this does the tiling for you but asynchronously; meaning that your drawing code and such has to handle being executed from one or more background threads."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the performance difference observed between iOS 4.3.5 and iOS 5.1.1 when rendering large custom UIViews (960 x 1380 pixels)?\n\nA) iOS 4.3.5 has less powerful hardware capabilities than iOS 5.1.1\nB) The drawRect: method is implemented inefficiently in the custom UIView\nC) iOS 4.3.5 uses an unoptimized code path for views larger than 1024 pixels on any side\nD) Core Animation is not properly utilized in the iOS 4.3.5 implementation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect.

Now if we increase $\\\\theta$ even slightly, the denominator becomes $\\-ve$ and the function value suddenly changes to `-infinity`. \n\nI'm finding it hard to wrap my head around this. Is there anything in real life that behaves like this? that is, changes its value from high positive to high negative abruptly..\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not entirely sure that this is a question about mathematics, but nature does not seem to have any essential discontinuities except (maybe) around a black hole. However, a black hole doesn't have a sign problem as you are having trouble with.\n\nIn particular, there don't seem to be any truly infinite amounts in the real world, at least not of anything involving mass or energy in any (even tiny) amounts, since an infinite amount of even tiny things yields a universe\\-swallowing black hole (again, maybe).\n\nThe fact is that infinity is a mathematical concept. And, it happens to be one that you're using slightly incorrectly. You say that at $\\\\theta\\=\\\\pi / 2$, $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ becomes $\\+\\\\infty$, but this isn't entirely true. The output of the function is *never* $\\+\\\\infty$! The more correct statement is that *for values of $\\\\theta$ between $\\-\\\\pi/2$ and $\\\\pi/2$*, as $\\\\theta$ approaches $\\\\pi/2$, $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ grows without bound. But, it never \"becomes\" $\\+\\\\infty$.\n\nThere is a similar statement on the other side of the discontinuity. For values of $\\\\theta$ between $\\\\pi/2$ and $3\\\\pi/2$, as $\\\\theta$ approaches $\\\\pi/2$, the value of $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ decreases without bound. But again, it is never actually $\\-\\\\infty$.\n\nPerhaps what might help is the fact that these two vastly different results actually have a very solid wall$\\-$a boundary$\\-$between them! The values of $\\\\theta$ which are below $\\\\pi/2$ are separated from the values of $\\\\theta$ which are above $\\\\pi/2$ by the one number which *actually is* $\\\\pi/2$. At this one value of $\\\\theta$, the expression $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ does not lean towards *either* side, but is rather totally undefined! That one input is actually a boundary between the two vastly\\-different results from both sides.\n\nHowever, this sort of behavior is rife through many different functions. Vertical asymptotes are very common in many functions in mathematics, and many of them experience this behavior of having opposite unbounded behavior immediately on either side of them, just like the tangent function."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the behavior of the tangent function tan(\u03b8) as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from both sides?\n\nA) The function becomes exactly +\u221e at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and then abruptly changes to -\u221e for values slightly larger than \u03c0/2.\n\nB) The function grows without bound as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from below, is undefined at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, and decreases without bound as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from above.\n\nC) The function oscillates rapidly between large positive and negative values as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from either side.\n\nD) The function reaches a maximum finite value at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and then smoothly transitions to negative values for \u03b8 > \u03c0/2.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B correctly describes the behavior of tan(\u03b8) near \u03c0/2. As \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from below, tan(\u03b8) grows without bound (approaches +\u221e). Exactly at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, tan(\u03b8) is undefined. For values of \u03b8 slightly larger than \u03c0/2, tan(\u03b8) decreases without bound (approaches -\u221e).

While there could be multiple causes for this, the successful solution involved uninstalling Java completely and downloading the Minecraft Java Edition directly from the Minecraft website. This suggests that the root cause was likely an outdated or conflicting Java installation on the user's system. \n\nOption A is unlikely as the crash occurs before graphics initialization.

Thank You \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If $B$ is a Boolean algebra with $\\\\bot$ as its bottom element (your $F$), an element $a\\\\in B$ is an *atom* of $B$ if $a\\\\ne\\\\bot$ and $\\\\{b\\\\in B:\\\\bot\\<b\\<a\\\\}\\=\\\\varnothing$. In other words the atoms of $B$ are the minimal non\\-$\\\\bot$ elements.\n\nYou can\u2019t show that $D\\_{30}$ by itself is a Boolean algebra, but you can show that it becomes one when you give it the right operations and order. The join of two elements of $D\\_{30}$ is their least common multiple, and the meet is their greatest common divisor: $m\\\\land n\\=\\\\gcd\\\\{m,n\\\\}$ and $m\\\\lor n\\=\\\\operatorname{lcm}\\\\{m,n\\\\}$. This means that the lattice order on $D\\_{30}$ is the divisibility relation: if $\\\\preceq$ denotes the lattice order ($m\\\\preceq n$ iff $m\\\\land n\\=m$), then $m\\\\preceq n$ iff $m\\\\mid n$. It\u2019s not hard to see that this means that $\\\\bot\\=1$ and $\\\\top\\=30$. The minimal elements of $D\\_{30}\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\}$ are then $2,3$, and $5$: every other member of $D\\_{30}\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\}$ has a non\\-trivial divisor and therefore fails to be minimal.\n\nTo show that $D\\_{30}$ with these operations really is a Boolean algebra, you simply have to verify that the operations have the required properties: each distributes over the other, and the lattice is complemented. The only part of this that perhaps isn\u2019t completely routine is figuring out what the complement of $n\\\\in D\\_{30}$ is. You need an element $m$ such that $n\\\\land m\\=\\\\bot$ and $n\\\\lor m\\=\\\\top$, i.e., such that $\\\\gcd\\\\{n,m\\\\}\\=1$ and $\\\\operatorname{lcm}\\\\{n,m\\\\}\\=30$; what\u2019s a simple description of that $m$ in terms of $n$?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Boolean algebra D\u2083\u2080 = {1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30}, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The complement of 6 in D\u2083\u2080 is 5\nB) The atoms of D\u2083\u2080 are 2, 3, and 6\nC) The join operation in D\u2083\u2080 is defined as the greatest common divisor\nD) The bottom element (\u22a5) of D\u2083\u2080 is 1\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. The complement of 6 should be an element m such that gcd(6,m) = 1 and lcm(6,m) = 30. This would be 5, but we need to verify both conditions before asserting this.\n\nB) Incorrect.

Mid players place wards on their own side of the mid lane, on top of the ledge, to gain vision of the opponent's high ground and movements. This placement offers several advantages:\n\n1. It provides vision of the opponent when creeps are fighting in the river, which otherwise would block sight of the enemy's high ground.\n2.

I am comfortable with these manipulations, and with the basic math of linear algebra in terms of understanding $\\\\Bbb{R}^3$ and $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ as abstract vector spaces over $\\\\Bbb{R}$ and $\\\\Bbb{C}$ respectively. Usually the manipulations in the complex domain are justified by appealing to the linearity of Maxwell's equations so that we can just \"keep track\" of the real part of the complex vector in question. This is where I don't quite follow. It seems that textbooks implicitly use some map (which I will refer to as $Re$) from $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ to $\\\\Bbb{R}^3$ in order to \"get back to the real field\" such that, for $(c\\_1,c\\_2,c\\_3\\) \\\\in \\\\Bbb{C}^3$,\n$$Re(c\\_1,c\\_2,c\\_3\\)\\=(Re(c\\_1\\),Re(c\\_2\\),Re(c\\_3\\))\\\\in \\\\Bbb{R}^3\\.$$ Is there any resource which you are aware of which is very careful about this correspondence, and which makes clear at every step of the way why a given operation on $\\\\Bbb{C}^3$ does not break this correspondence effected by $Re$? I suppose that ultimately this question is about phasors more generally, but I was hoping for a resource specifically for electromagnetism since here we have complex vectors, as opposed to just complex numbers in, say, AC circuit theory.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose we have some equation involving complex variables, such as $a \\= b \\+ c$ or $a \\= bc$. You simply want to know when the equation remains true if we replace all the complex variables with their real parts. (Of course, here we are defining the real part of a complex vector to be a vector whose entries are the real parts of the entries of the complex vector, the real part of a complex vector field to be the real vector field whose value at each point is the real part of the complex vector field, and so on. In all cases we extend the definition of the phrase \"the real part\" naturally.)\n\nThe general rule is that it works whenever we only perform linear operations, which means multiplication by scalars and adding complex variables together, which follows from high school algebra. Thus, $a \\= b \\+ c$ implies $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(c)$, as well as $\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha b) \\+ \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha c)$ for any complex number $\\\\alpha$, while $a \\= bc$ does not imply $\\\\text{Re}(a) \\= \\\\text{Re}(b) \\\\, \\\\text{Re}(c)$ in general.\n\nIs it really so simple? Don't the textbooks do all kinds of operations, like time derivatives, divergences, curls, gradients, and Laplacians as well? If you recall the definition of a derivative,\n$$f'(x) \\= \\\\lim\\_{\\\\Delta x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x \\+ \\\\Delta x) \\- f(x)}{\\\\Delta x}$$\nyou'll see that a derivative is merely a particular example of subtracting two complex variables and then dividing by a scalar. That's true for all kinds of derivatives, so you're allowed to take any kind of derivative of both sides while preserving the desired property. There's really not much to it, which is why textbooks don't keep careful track of it.\n\nOf course, the fact that you can't multiply variables together means you need to be careful when dealing with quantities that are quadratic in the field, such as the power, energy, or momentum."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In electromagnetic wave propagation, complex analysis is often used to simplify calculations.

My initial inclination would be to place the move method in the Item class since it is the item that is actually moving.\n\nHowever, that would create a circular dependency.

It's ok to have non\\-entity items, such as MoveManager, and call it part of your domain.

I am sure about my gradient function calculation, I have also check it with the `DerivativeCheck` option. So, that leaves the possibility of data not being standardized. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it is desirable to standardize the data while learning Gaussian processes regression. There are a number of reasons:\n\n1. In common Gaussian processes regression model we suppose that output $y$ has zero mean, so we should standardize $y$ to match our assumption.\n2. For many covariance function we have scale parameters in covariance functions. So, we should standardize inputs to get better estimation of parameters of covariance functions.\n3. Gaussian processes regression is prone to numerical problems as we have to inverse ill\\-conditioned covariance matrix. To make this problem less severe, you should standardize your data.\n\nSome packages do this job for you, for example GPR in sklearn has an option *normalize* for normalization of inputs, while not outputs; see [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20150317010512/http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcess.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which of the following statements best describes the importance and implications of data standardization?\n\nA) Standardization is unnecessary for GPR and can lead to inaccurate predictions at test time.\n\nB) Standardization is crucial for GPR, but should only be applied to the input features and not the target variable.\n\nC) Standardization is important for GPR, helping with numerical stability, parameter estimation, and model assumptions, but requires careful handling for test data.\n\nD) Standardization in GPR is only necessary when using certain optimization algorithms like minFunc.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Answer C is correct because it accurately captures the importance and nuances of data standardization in GPR.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they either misrepresent the changes or confuse the two types of invariants."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/27", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/177617", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/80556/"], "docs_id": 177617, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> The movie was **excited**.\n\nvs.\n\n> The movie was **exciting**.\n\nWhat situation we need to use \"\\-ed\" or \"\\-ing\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's passive (be excited) vs. adjective (exciting).\n\n> The movie was **exciting**.

This follows the pattern explained in the documentation.\n\nB) This is incorrect because it reverses the usage. \"Excited\" should describe the audience, not the movie, and \"exciting\" should describe the audience's feeling, not the movie.\n\nC) This is incorrect because it misuses both forms. Movies can't be \"thrilled\" or \"excited\" (these describe feelings), and people aren't typically described as \"thrilling.\"\n\nD) This is incorrect because it swaps the usage. The movie should be described with the -ing form (exciting) and the audience with the -ed form (excited).\n\nThe key is to remember that -ing forms often describe the cause of a feeling (the exciting movie), while -ed forms describe the resulting feeling in people (the excited audience)."}}
