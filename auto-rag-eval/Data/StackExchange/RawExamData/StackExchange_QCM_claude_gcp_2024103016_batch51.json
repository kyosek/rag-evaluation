I had planned for a standard size of 4 x 8 and maybe 2 3/4 inches tall. However, the brick that I like comes in this size: 2\\-1/4 x 3\\-5/8 x 7\\-5/8\\. I first thought that this was a smaller size specifically meant to be installed with a concrete foundation and mortar base. I would think that a shorter height makes it more susceptible to rotating if laid in sand, but this is not a problem when embedded in mortar. And they are skinnier to fit into a standard brick size when surrounded by mortar.\n\nOr, it doesn't matter. The brick manufacturers picked one particular size to sell, and its up to the installer to decide sand or mortar bedding. \n\nCan I still use the smaller bricks with a sand bed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Depends. I use substantial amounts of chipped wood in my tree farm operation. I find that I like to wear gloves working with it because the ends are sharp, and it's a source of splinters. It's painful to walk on barefoot.\n\nIf you use it as garden mulch, it should be composted for about 3 months first. Pine in particular is loaded with terpenes which is tough on other plants. 3 months kept damp and the terpenes decompose or leach out.\n\nIf you have a garden plot, or an annuals bed, compost it for one season, then spade it into the plot. Wood chips hold moisture and will reduce the needed frequency of watering.\n\nDo NOT use it as a thin layer in muddy areas. It mixes with the mud, and you end up with a region that never dries out. If you wish to use it this way, put down a layer of geotextile first, then put a layer of wood chips on that.\n\nYou can also just spread it out with a rake, and after a rain go over it with a roller. It will gradually decompose into your sod."}, "answer": "This documentation seems to be a mix of unrelated topics, combining information about brick pavers and wood chips. I'll create a question based on the wood chip information, as it's more coherent:\n\nQuestion: When using wood chips in landscaping, which of the following practices is recommended?\n\nA) Use fresh wood chips as garden mulch immediately after obtaining them\nB) Apply a thin layer of wood chips directly on muddy areas to improve drainage\nC) Compost wood chips for about 3 months before using as garden mulch\nD) Avoid using wood chips in tree farming operations due to splinter risks\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that when using wood chips as garden mulch, they should be composted for about 3 months first. This is especially important for pine chips, which contain terpenes that can be harmful to other plants. Composting allows these compounds to decompose or leach out.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because fresh wood chips, especially from pine, can be harmful to plants due to their terpene content.\n\nAnswer B is discouraged in the text, which warns against using wood chips as a thin layer in muddy areas without a geotextile barrier.\n\nAnswer D contradicts the information provided, as the text mentions using wood chips in tree farming, though it does recommend wearing gloves due to potential splinters."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/18", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7805862", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1000898/"], "docs_id": 7805862, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can anyone help???\n\nI want to implement in my application.\n\nThanks, In advance\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The `AjaxControlToolkit` has a `CascadingDropDown` control:\n\n[CascadingDropDown Demonstration](http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/AjaxControlToolkitSampleSite/CascadingDropDown/CascadingDropDown.aspx)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is building a web application that requires dependent dropdown lists. They want to implement cascading dropdowns where selecting an option in one dropdown populates the next dropdown with relevant choices. Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient and user-friendly solution for this requirement?\n\nA) Implement custom JavaScript functions to manually handle AJAX calls and DOM manipulation for each dropdown change event\n\nB) Use the AjaxControlToolkit's CascadingDropDown control to automatically manage the dependent dropdowns\n\nC) Reload the entire page each time a dropdown selection is made to update the subsequent dropdowns\n\nD) Create separate web forms for each possible combination of dropdown selections\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe AjaxControlToolkit's CascadingDropDown control is specifically designed for this purpose and offers the most efficient solution. It automatically handles the AJAX calls and updates to dependent dropdowns without requiring custom JavaScript or full page reloads. This approach provides a smooth user experience and reduces development time.\n\nOption A, while possible, would require more code and be more prone to errors compared to using a pre-built solution. \n\nOption C would result in a poor user experience due to constant page reloads. \n\nOption D is impractical and would lead to an excessive number of web forms, making the application difficult to maintain."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/31", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/233451", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/259214/"], "docs_id": 233451, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Look [there](https://stackexchange.com/users/3548243/nicael?tab=reputation).

According to the documentation, the service responsible for aggregating network activity across the StackExchange network stopped working, causing the filters to appear \"frozen\" and not updating with new content. The issue was resolved by identifying and fixing the bug in this service, allowing it to resume normal operation and update the filters with current information. This also explains why filter emails resumed after the fix and why some users may have received duplicate emails during the recovery process.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no mention of intentional freezing or manual updates.

It directly states the total number of homework instances completed without any ambiguity.\n\nD) This statement, while creative, is still unclear and could be misinterpreted.

There are many reasons for it to settle. Most are due to the surrounding earth getting removed or saturated (soft and compressed). Either leaves the concrete/block unsupported.

The top answer suggests that these cracks are likely due to foundation settling caused by changes in the surrounding earth. \n\nThe immediate recommended action is to caulk the crack in the exterior brick. This serves two purposes:\n1. It prevents water from entering the structure, which could cause further damage.\n2. It allows for future monitoring - if the caulk cracks again, it indicates ongoing movement.\n\nWhile option A might seem plausible, calling a structural engineer immediately is not the first recommended step.

A \"cheese build\" in StarCraft 2 is characterized as an unstable strategy that aims to exploit a specific weakness in the opponent's play. This aligns with the definition provided in the documentation, which states that a cheese build is \"generally unstable in the long-run, but is used to exploit a single weakness.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because cheese builds are typically not sophisticated or complex, but rather straightforward strategies aimed at catching the opponent off-guard.\n\nOption B is the opposite of a cheese build. Cheese builds sacrifice long-term stability for short-term advantages, unlike the description in this option.\n\nOption D describes a more standard, well-rounded approach to the game, which is not characteristic of a cheese build. Cheese builds often focus heavily on offense at the expense of defense or economic development.\n\nThe term \"cheese\" in this context relates to the informal use of \"cheesy,\" implying a strategy that might be seen as low-quality, overdramatic, or inelegant, but potentially effective in exploiting a specific weakness."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/29", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/163957", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/31536/"], "docs_id": 163957, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I installed porcelain floor tile with this [single component grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Fusion-Pro-381-Bright-White-1-Gal-Single-Component-Grout-FP3811-2T/203705529).

It was not the only victim of the culling. \n\n**EDIT**  \n\nThe comment which was deleted was, I felt, useful, it was not idle chatter. It was useful to point out that the incriminating post was invisible for users like myself who do not have 10K on Stack Overflow, it was complimenting the OP on the amount of care and attention they spent in composing the question and at the same time reminding users that a post so well thought out and argued takes considerable time. Then there was something else, but I've completely forgotten what it was, too bad, I suppose. If ever there was a more conciliatory comment then that was it.\n\nOn a closely related issue, anything can be interpreted in the wrong light by one or more users, this inevitably leads to prejudicial treatment, and that risk increases when the person commenting is a non\\-native speaker. A number of non\\-native users' posts and comments are weak on nuance, tone and \u2018diplomacy\u2019, and some languages adopt a more direct, perhaps brusque, approach than the pleasantries the English language employs. **This missing tone can make or break a post or a comment.** \n\nHere is one such [question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/327041/4) which I recently edited because the downvotes seemed to be a knee\\-jerk reaction to the OP's original title. After the not insignificant edit, the upvotes started to arrive. \n\nMods and CMs alike should always be fair, even towards users they may personally dislike or find particularly annoying, and recent events have led me to believe that I fit into that category. I have been warned of misusing comments and the veiled threat of suspension has been used as a stick to dissuade me from actively participating. This sounds like sour grapes, doesn't it? It's not. My reaction on finding that a comment (which did not violate CoC and was not off\\-topic) of mine was yet again deleted is of stunned disbelief. \n\nI thought comments on Meta were viewed differently from those on the main site. I found the following [topic](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/270427/when-should-comments-be-flagged-deleted-on-per-site-metas), posted in 2015 by a highly respected mod on a number of SE sites and very recently also appointed as a mod on Meta. \n\n\\[Emphasis in bold mine]\n\n> We all know what comments are for \\-\\- and aren't, but that guidance is, naturally, geared toward main sites, where we want to keep things clean and focused. Meta, on the other hand, is a site's \"second place\", with some different rules and conventions. For example, questions on main sites can be closed as primarily\\-opinion\\-based, **but meta is all about opinions. There's a \"discussion\" tag and such questions collect many opinions. Meta is different.**\n\nThe OP of *Stack Overflow has engaged in ideological censorship and unwelcoming behavior* also expressed perplexity on the deletion of several comments beneath their post. The mod who undertook this action, replied \n \\[Emphasis in bold mine] \n\n> Anything that provided context, potential clarifications/requests that didn't feel like they'd fit into an answer that was on topic but were useful or talked about possible reasons to close (since they are automatic)\\- and a few more that felt like they wouldn't be answers. I *could* have purged them all, and it was tempting, but if you're going to argue out points in comments, that's not what they are there for. **And now, I'll be doing a second round of cleanups**\n\nLater, they added this further explanation\n\n> So, We'll be rather agressively pruning the comments here. Its not social commentary, just housekeeping \\- **but feel free to post any substancial information that's of interest on this topic as a *post***.\n\nI 100% disagree, it is still social commentary. Only the comments agreeing with the deletion of the answer were allowed to stand. How is that not social commentary?\n\nIt's also worth noting that it is impossible to post an answer on a question that has been placed on hold, so that comment was poorly thought out. It happens. \n\nHenceforth\u2013*lovely word*\u2013I shall be taking screenshots of every comment I post on MSE, especially those which express disagreement with a decision undertaken by the team and *do not* violate the CoC.

And eventually those comments add up.\n\nI could comment on your post, and not actually need to worry about folks downvoting. I'd also lose the ability to have any flavour of nuance. In short, any comment at all could *plausibly* be deleted. SE's toyed with renaming comments clarifications and that's what they are for. Its worth remembering that a post getting over 20 comments is an auto flag, and we often wait, and see before we clear out comments on MSE.\n\nAs for clearing the comments themselves \\- the decision wasn't based on my agreement or disagreement with the comments, but rather how useful they seemed.. I cleared out most of them \\- as is common practice here and elsewhere. Considering the content being about *censorship*, its worth remembering I cleared out comments on *both* sides of the debate that seemed argumentative, keeping a few that felt like they provided useful context.\n\nIf a comment was afoul of the COC, we'd do *much* more than simply clear out the comment\n\n> Mods and CMs alike should always be fair, even towards users they may personally dislike or find particularly annoying, and recent events have led me to believe that I fit into that category.

I'd totally get a second opinion if it was about a *specific* user. *Its not about you* but a *general cleanup of comments*. If you somehow feel its about you, and you've constantly been reminded about the appropriate use of comments, well, maybe you might want to consider why. As a whole *36* comments were deleted, many of them were not yours. Its certainly nothing personal. \n\nSome posts are tricky. The extra clarification was *precisely* because I figured someone would decide to *turn it political* when it wasn't. I also wanted to make it clear that, well *I* made the call, simply cause of the sheer amount of emotion over the issue. \n\nThe closure was a hard call. At the end of the day, this *entirely* seemed like a reaction to a post on MSO, involving issues that have been hashed out in detail on MSO, involving SO community culture.

But, put that aside for now, just know they don't really switch, but that in many my\\-first\\-schematic designs they can be seen as a switch because you are allowed to ignore the tiny bit of behaviour that makes it not exactly that.\n\nSo in the following we are going to assume the transistor actually is a switch, which switches the current path between its collector and emitter on when a current flows in the right direction through the base. Because I'm going to take some care in my images to make sure that assumption will work.\n\nA transistor:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oihob.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2foihob.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIt's a single NPN type transistor. There's two types: NPN and PNP, they work almost entirely the same, just the PNP has the currents flowing the other way around. Again, for now, ignore PNPs exist, no running before walking, we only know NPN.\n\nLet's make it do something: Let's let it control a LED. (feel free to go along with this, if you happen to have a bread\\-board handy, by the way).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1Sgr.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fG1Sgr.png)\n\nThe LED is pink, because pink LEDs are cool.\n\nNow, if the transistor turns on, the LED will turn on: In an NPN transistor no current is \"allowed\" to flow from the collector to the emitter if the base is not activated. If the base *is* activated, the current will be allowed to flow and the transistor would really like it if you designed it so the current goes from collector to emitter in an NPN type.\n\nHow do we activate the base? By forcing a little current into it. So, step one, let a human control the base:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyaex.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fKyaex.png)\n\nWhen you push the switch, the current goes from the \\+5V through R2 into the base of transistor Q1\\. Then the collector will allow current to flow to the emitter, because the LED will also want to conduct current in that direction, the LED will now turn on.\n\nNow, this is about where you get stuck: What if \"*I*\" don't want to push a button?\n\nWell.... we could have another transistor in there:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxas9.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fqxas9.png)\n\nBut... same difference! Now we just have another base to control!\n\nYes.\n\nBut;\n\nIt's already become more interesting! Imagine our switch back into that circuit, but now connected with another 10k resistor to the base of Q2\\. If you push the switch, Q2 will turn on, right? Right! Now, the base of the Q1 will be pulled to ground, because the Q2 will happily conduct enough current to have nearly all of the 5V fall across the R2\\. So Q1 will actually turn off. So when you push the button the LED goes off. If you release the button, Q2 will turn off. Which will let the current from R2 flow into the base of Q1 in stead of into the collector of Q2\\. Now Q1 will turn on and the LED will turn on.\n\nThis behaviour we summarise with the name \"Inverter\".\n\nWhat's more than 2 transistors? 3!\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXbKv.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fnXbKv.png)\n\nCan you see that when you push switch SW1, Q2 will turn on and everything will be as we said just now? Can you also see that the same will happen when you press SW2? SW2 turns on Q3, then Q3 pulls the current into its collector and it will not go into Q1, so Q1 will be off. If you push no switches, the current through R2 will be able to go into Q1 and turn it on. If you push both switches, Q2 and Q3 will find a way between them to share the current through R2 and again Q1 will go off.\n\nso if you press SW1 OR you press SW2 OR you press both, the LED will go off, else it will go on.\n\nIf you consider the LED's light as the output we call this an OR\\-gate with an inverting output.\n\nCan you see where this is going? If transistors can control each other when they are used as a switching element, we can start to build logic gates.\n\nIn the same way:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jvo4p.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fJvo4p.png)\n\nIs another type of logic gate.\n\nIf you press neither button, the LED will be on. If you press only SW1 the base of Q2 will want to take the current and Q2 will then want to conduct, but it cannot, because Q3 isn't conducting, so nothing happens.\n\nIf you press only SW2, the base of Q3 will be able to take some current, it will then allow current to go from its collector to the emitter, but Q2 is now turned off, so again, no current can flow and the resistor R2 keeps turning on Q1, so the LED stays on.\n\nIf you now press SW1 and SW2, both Q2 and Q3 will want to conduct, because there is no more obstruction, the current from R2 can flow through both Q2 and Q3 to ground and will not go into Q1's base, so Q1 will turn off.\n\nThis is called an AND\\-Gate with inverting output.\n\nNow we can start using the gates we just \"invented\" and several other ones to build other bigger blocks. We know how gates can work, so we can take it one step further. Imagine the switches are inputs and the LED is an actual electrical output and you pretty much have a working gate. In \"the real world\" they are designed much more efficiently for lower power, higher speed and such, but the idea in broad lines is the same.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of transistor-based logic gates, which of the following statements is correct regarding the behavior of the circuit shown in the last schematic (with Q1, Q2, Q3, and the LED)?\n\nA) The circuit functions as a NAND gate with the LED as output.\nB) The LED will turn on only when both SW1 and SW2 are pressed.\nC) The circuit functions as a NOR gate with the LED as output.\nD) The LED will turn off only when both SW1 and SW2 are pressed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The circuit in the last schematic functions as an AND gate with an inverting output. The LED (output) will be on by default due to current flowing through R2 into Q1's base. When either SW1 or SW2 is pressed individually, the LED remains on because the current path through Q2 and Q3 is not complete. Only when both SW1 and SW2 are pressed simultaneously does the current from R2 flow through Q2 and Q3 to ground, preventing it from reaching Q1's base.

Are both suitable to use with Time Series or which one is more suitable?\n\nThanks beforehand!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have never worked with recurrent networks, but from what I know, in practice, some RNN and TDNN can be used for the same purpose that you want: Predict time series values. However, they work different.\n\nIt is possible with TDNN:\n\n* Predict process' values\n* Find a relationship between two processes.\n\nSome RNN, like [NARX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_autoregressive_exogenous_model) also allow you to do that, and it is also used to predict financial time series, usually better than TDNN.\n\nA TDNN looks more like a feedforward network, because time aspect is only inserted through its inputs, unlike NARX that also needs the predicted/real future value as input. This characteristic makes TDNN less robust than NARX for predicting values, but requires less processing and is easier to train.\n\nIf you are trying to find a relationship between a process $X(t)$ and a process $Y(t)$, NARX requires you to have past values of $Y$, while TDNN does not.\n\nI recommend reading Simon Haykin's Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation (2nd Edition) and this [FAQ](ftp://ftp.sas.com/pub/neural/FAQ.html). There are lots of neural networks architectures and variations. Sometimes they have many names or there is no consensus about their classification."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A financial analyst wants to predict stock prices using neural networks. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for this task?\n\nA) TDNNs are always superior to RNNs for financial time series prediction due to their simpler architecture.\n\nB) RNNs, particularly NARX models, generally outperform TDNNs in predicting financial time series, but require more processing power and are harder to train.\n\nC) TDNNs and RNNs perform identically for financial time series prediction, with no significant differences in their capabilities or requirements.\n\nD) RNNs are unsuitable for financial time series prediction because they cannot maintain internal state information.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it accurately reflects the information provided. RNNs, especially NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous) models, are generally considered to perform better than TDNNs for predicting financial time series. However, they do require more processing power and are more challenging to train.\n\nOption A is incorrect because TDNNs are not always superior. While they may be simpler, they are often less robust for prediction tasks.\n\nOption C is false because there are significant differences between TDNNs and RNNs in terms of their architecture, capabilities, and requirements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because RNNs are actually well-suited for maintaining internal state information, which is one of their key advantages in time series prediction."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/27", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5793", "https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/users/39260/"], "docs_id": 5793, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is general question regarding guideline of where to post non\\-technical questions.\n\nI had non\\-technical question at\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15653199/free\\-compiler\\-ide\\-for\\-writing\\-windows\\-app\\-in\\-c\\-for\\-students](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15653199/free-compiler-ide-for-writing-windows-app-in-c-for-students) and it was marked as off\\-topic and asked to move to softwareengineering.stackexchange.com.\n\nSo I did [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/193138/free\\-compiler\\-ide\\-for\\-writing\\-windows\\-app\\-in\\-c\\-for\\-students?noredirect\\=1](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/193138/free-compiler-ide-for-writing-windows-app-in-c-for-students?noredirect=1)\n\nand then it got marked as off\\-topic and migrated back to stackoverflow.\nKnowing clear guideline will prevent me asking question in a wrong venue next time.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are at the whims of the community when it comes to borderline questions.

The fifo has a fixed width of 64K by which if the buffer is filled by that point further writes will block until the reader has caught up.\n3. The pipe writer will by killed with SIGPIPE if the reader dies or exits.\n\nThis will mean that your problem (emulate buffered I/O on a non\\-buffered write) will be resolved. That is because the new 'limit' on your FIFO will in effect become the speed of whatever utility is writing what is in the pipe to disk (which presumably will be buffered I/O).\n\nNevertheless, the writer becomes dependant on your log reader to function. If the reader stops suddently reading, the writer will block. If the reader suddenly exits (lets say you run out of disk space on your target) the writer will SIGPIPE and probably exit.\n\nAnother point to mention is if the server panics and the kernel stops responding you may lose up to 64k of data that was in that buffer.\n\nAnother way to fix this will be to write logs to tmpfs (/dev/shm on linux) and tail the output to a fixed disk location. There are less restrictive limits on memory allocation doing this (not 64K, typically 2G!) but might not work for you if the writer has no dynamic way to reopen logfiles (you would have to clean out the logs from tmpfs periodically). If the server panics in this method you could lose a LOT more data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software team is implementing a logging solution for an application where they don't have access to the source code. They decide to use a FIFO (named pipe) approach. Which of the following is NOT a potential caveat or limitation of this method?\n\nA) The application's writes to the FIFO may block indefinitely if there's no active reader at the other end.\nB) The FIFO has a fixed buffer size of 64KB, beyond which writes will block until the reader catches up.\nC) If the reader process (e.g., 'cat') dies or exits, the writer (the application) will receive a SIGPIPE signal.\nD) The FIFO approach guarantees that all log messages will be preserved even if the kernel panics or the system crashes suddenly.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and C are all valid caveats or limitations of using a FIFO for logging as described in the documentation. However, option D is incorrect. The FIFO approach does not guarantee that all log messages will be preserved in case of a kernel panic or sudden system crash. In fact, the documentation mentions that up to 64KB of data in the FIFO buffer could be lost in such scenarios. Therefore, D is not a caveat or limitation of this method, making it the correct answer to the question asking which is NOT a potential issue."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/22", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/299696", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/98677/"], "docs_id": 299696, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need help with clustering algorithm.

From my understanding of the Geohash algorithm you can't just select all the points inside a given bounding box by simple string comparison.\n\nThis image might help understanding it a bit better:\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6LYk.jpg)  \n\n(image from [http://www.movable\\-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg))\n\nIf you have a bounding box going covering a region in Canada for instance within the `c` and `f` regions, string comparison would necessarily select regions in `d` and `e` regions as well, which are geographically at a very different place. So if you are able to design a correct query, it would probably be close to a Geohash decoding algorithm which is computationally quite expensive for big data sets.\n\nFor your question regarding a simple clustering algorithm, the problem is similar. Clustering algorithms all work based on some distance metrics. And a Geohash does not provide a generic way for conveniently computing the geographical distance between two far\\-away hashes.\n\nHowever there are probably two paths you can take.\n\nOne option is to store your data (maybe additionally to the Geohash format, depending on your requirements), in simple indexed lat and lng columns, or as geometries (with a spatial index). In the case of using geometries, you can use the [Spatial Relation Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html) in MySQL (e.g. `MBRContains`).\n\nThe other option is if you only want to cluster the markers in Leaflet, similarly to the Leaflet MarkerClusterer, you could just group by the first character in the Geohash for zoom level 0\\. For more fine grained clustering, you might need more computation and be better off with the previous option."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a web mapping application that needs to cluster 60,000 markers efficiently. The data is stored in a MySQL database with columns for latitude, longitude, and geohash (12 characters). Which approach would be most effective for implementing server-side clustering that performs well at various zoom levels?\n\nA) Use string comparison on geohash prefixes to select points within a bounding box, grouping by the first N characters of the geohash based on zoom level.\n\nB) Store data as geometries with a spatial index and use MySQL Spatial Relation Functions like MBRContains for querying points within a bounding box.\n\nC) Implement a custom PHP algorithm that decodes geohashes to calculate distances between points for clustering.\n\nD) Use the existing geohash column with LEFT() function to group markers, combined with BETWEEN for bounding box queries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most effective approach for this scenario. Storing the data as geometries with a spatial index allows for efficient querying of points within a bounding box using MySQL's Spatial Relation Functions like MBRContains. This method scales well for large datasets and various zoom levels.\n\nOption A is incorrect because string comparison on geohash prefixes can lead to inaccurate results, including points outside the actual bounding box.\n\nOption C would be computationally expensive and inefficient for large datasets, especially at lower zoom levels.\n\nOption D, while using the existing geohash column, doesn't provide accurate bounding box queries and may not perform well with a large number of markers.\n\nThe correct approach (B) leverages MySQL's built-in spatial capabilities, providing both accuracy and performance for clustering large numbers of markers across different zoom levels."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/10/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/400269", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/43536/"], "docs_id": 400269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The theory is that access modifiers improve code safety because they support encapsulation of internal state. When doing OOP, every language I've used implements some kind of access restriction. I like some access models better than others.\n\nI am on a team of Java developers. Our projects spend time in code reviews considering the access modifiers, their appropriateness, and the use of things like @VisibleForTesting (a Java annotation). Our projects also occasionally spend time de\\-finalizing or de\\-privatizing something in a 3rd party library if a source\\-code change is not feasible.\n\nI went looking for the research that shows how the use of access modifiers affects defect density or occurrences of run\\-time errors. I cannot find any studies on it. Maybe my Google\\-Fu is weak. What is the evidence that access modifiers actually provide the benefits we assume they do? Where are the studies that quantify the problems with how access modifiers are used?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me give you a real world example of when access modifiers \"mattered\" that I ran into personally:\n\nOur software is primarily python, and one way that python differs from most other OO languages is that there are no explicit access modifiers. Instead, it is convention to prefix methods and attributes that should be private with an underscore.\n\nOne day, a developer was working on a particular feature, and could not make it work with the interface of the object he was working with. But he noticed that if he worked with a particular attribute that was marked private, he could do what he wanted to do. So he did it, checked it in, and (unfortunately) it slipped past code review, and into the master branch.\n\nFast forward two years. That developer had moved on. We updated to a newer version of an underlying library. Code that had been reliably suddenly stopped working. This resulted in lots of debugging and back\\-and\\-forth messages with another team in a different time zone. \n\nEventually we figured out the issue: the developers who owned that underlying object changed the way it worked in a very subtle way. Subtle enough that no exceptions were thrown, no other errors occurred. The library just became flaky. This happened because the developers of that library had no clue that they were doing anything that would cause any troubles to anyone. They were changing something internal, not the interface.\n\nSo after the fact we did what should have been done originally: we asked the library developers to add a public method that solved our problem rather than mucking about with the internals of their objects.\n\nSo that's what access modifiers prevent. They ensure that the separation of interface and implementation is clear. It lets users know exactly what they can do with the class safely and lets developers of the class change internals without breaking user's software.\n\nYou could do this all with convention, not force, as python shows, but even where it's just convention, having that public/private separation is a great boon toward maintainability."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is working on a large-scale Java project. They are debating the importance of access modifiers. Which of the following best describes the primary benefit of using access modifiers in object-oriented programming, as illustrated by the example in the documentation?\n\nA) Access modifiers improve code execution speed by limiting the scope of variables.\nB) Access modifiers prevent other developers from using any part of a class, ensuring complete encapsulation.\nC) Access modifiers allow for clear separation between interface and implementation, enabling safer internal changes without breaking user code.\nD) Access modifiers automatically fix bugs in third-party libraries by restricting access to problematic code.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation provides a real-world example where the lack of strict access modifiers (in Python) led to a developer using a private attribute, which later caused issues when the internal implementation changed. Access modifiers in languages like Java help maintain a clear distinction between the public interface that users of a class should interact with and the private implementation details. This separation allows developers to modify internal workings without inadvertently breaking code that depends on the class, as long as the public interface remains consistent. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they either misrepresent the purpose of access modifiers or overstate their capabilities."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/383465", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/34900/"], "docs_id": 383465, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to get to a point where I can quickly filter thousands of points in a shapefile.

And this redefinition does call `\\@listi`, `\\@listii`. Something that the original definition of `trivlist` in the LaTeX kernel does not.\n* KOMA\\-Script classes has extra code in `\\@listi` etc. for documents (or passages of documents) to avoid addition of `\\parskip` and usual `\\topsep`. This sets `\\topsep` to zero whenever `\\parskip` is greater than zero. But inside `enumitem`'s `trivlist` `\\parskip` is already greater than zero, when `\\@listi` (etc.) is called.

Meaning, for our purposes, anything in these address blocks shouldn't be assigned because they shouldn't be routable \"publicly\".\n\n```\n0.0.0.0/8\n10.0.0.0/8\n100.64.0.0/10\n127.0.0.0/8\n169.254.0.0/16\n172.16.0.0/12\n192.0.0.0/24\n192.0.0.0/29\n192.0.0.8/32\n192.0.0.9/32\n192.0.0.170/32\n192.0.0.171/32\n192.0.2.0/24\n192.31.196.0/24\n192.52.193.0/24\n192.88.99.0/24\n192.168.0.0/16\n192.175.48.0/24\n198.18.0.0/15\n198.51.100.0/24\n203.0.113.0/24\n240.0.0.0/4\n255.255.255.255/32\n\n# Also to be considered, multicast addresses subnet:\n224.0.0.0/4\n\n```\n\nThis is more consistent with the example you provided above.\n\nIf you don't understand CIDR notation, you can convert them to ranges [here](http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A network administrator needs to assign a private IP address range for a new office network. Which of the following address ranges would be most appropriate for this purpose?\n\nA) 172.32.0.0 - 172.63.255.255\nB) 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255\nC) 203.0.113.0 - 203.0.113.255\nD) 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This range is not part of the private IP address spaces defined by IANA. The correct private range for 172.x.x.x addresses is 172.16.0.0/12, which covers 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255.\n\nB) This is correct. The 192.168.0.0/16 range is one of the standard private IP address ranges defined by IANA for use in local networks.\n\nC) This range (203.0.113.0/24) is reserved for documentation and examples. It's not intended for actual network use.\n\nD) This range (224.0.0.0/4) is reserved for IP multicast addresses and should not be used for regular network addressing.\n\nThe question tests understanding of private IP address ranges and the ability to identify appropriate address spaces for local network use."}}
