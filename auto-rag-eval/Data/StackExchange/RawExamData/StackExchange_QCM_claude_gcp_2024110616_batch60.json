It has to do with interpreting Pearson's *r*, and I've never quite seen it expressed this way:\n\n*\"The correlation coefficient expresses relationship in terms of z scores (standard deviations). For instance, the correlation of \u2212.609 conveys that as the independent variable X goes up by one standard deviation, the dependent variable Y is predicted to decrease by .609 standard deviations.\"*\n\nI'm wondering if this is\n\na) accurate (is *r* literally a z\\-score?)\n\nand if\n\nb) someone can flesh out what this *is*, in fact, trying to say.\n\nIt's not that I'm unfamiliar with Pearson's r \\- far from it, in fact. But I didn't really learn to interpret them in terms of z\\-scores. I'm aware that r can be calculated as the sum of the products of each pair of z\\-scores (for X and Y, that is) divided by the sample size, but I'm not quite sure what they're getting at. The bit I've quoted makes me think of the good ol' explanation of regression betas that you always get in intro stats, but I'm otherwise a bit stumped. (And embarrassed, too \\- seems so basic!)\n\nAnyone want to take a crack at this?\n\nThanks!\n\nl\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Pearson sample correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#For_a_sample) can be written as:\n\n$$r \\= \\\\frac{1}{n\\-1} \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n z\\_{1,i} \\\\cdot z\\_{2,i} \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad z\\_{k,i} \\= \\\\frac{x\\_{k,i} \\- \\\\bar{x}\\_k}{s\\_k}.$$\n\nThis result means that the sample correlation of two vectors $\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\_1$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\_2$ is equivalent to the sample correlation of their z\\-scores $\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\_1$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\_2$ (i.e., sample correlation is determined through the z\\-scores). Hence, it is accurate to say that the correlation coefficient expresses a relationship between the z\\-scores of the two sample vectors.\n\nThe second part of the statement, about the predictive effect of a change in one variable, is not true in general, but is true in the special case where the underlying data is jointly\\-normal (so long as we interpret the statement without conflating correlation and cause$^\\\\dagger$). If we have an underlying normal distribution $(X\\_1, X\\_2\\) \\\\sim \\\\text{N}$ then the expected difference in $Z\\_2$ conditional on an \"increase\" from $Z\\_1 \\= x$ to $Z\\_1 \\= x\\+k$ is:\n\n$$\\\\text{Expected difference } (\\\\Delta \\= k) \\= \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x \\+ k) \\- \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x) \\= \\\\rho \\\\cdot k.$$\n\nHence, replacing the true correlation with the sample correlation you would have the predictive result:\n\n$$\\\\text{Predicted change}(\\\\Delta \\= k) \\= \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x \\+ k) \\- \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x) \\= r \\\\cdot k.$$\n\nNow, taking $k\\=1$ yields an interpretation of $r$ as the predictive change in this case:\n\n$$\\\\text{Predicted change}(\\\\Delta \\= 1\\) \\= r \\\\cdot 1 \\= r.$$\n\nHence, we see that for data from an underlying joint\\-normal distribution, an \"increase\" of one standard deviation for one of the variables, leads to a predictive change of $r$ standard deviations for the other variable. Note that this result is not a general result, and holds only in the case where the underlying distribution of the data is jointly normal. The second part of the statement should therefore be interpreted as a \"rule of thumb\" that applies in the jointly\\-normal case, but would apply only approximately for other distributions.\n\n---\n\n$^\\\\dagger$ Note that in the above exposition we need to be careful not to conflate correlation with cause. Strictly speaking, if we *increase* $X\\_1$ through some action, then it is not appropriate to make a prediction based on the correlation, since we now need to know the causal effect of that increase. Hence, the above equations should be interpreted as predictive changes comparing two different observations of $X\\_1$ that differ by a specified amount. We have indicated this by referring to the \"increase\" in quotation marks."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Pearson's correlation coefficient, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher in social sciences is studying the relationship between hours spent on social media (X) and academic performance (Y) in college students. They calculate a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = -0.45. A student asks about the interpretation of this result. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the meaning of this correlation coefficient in the context of z-scores and predictive relationships?\n\nA) For every standard deviation increase in social media use, academic performance is predicted to decrease by exactly 0.45 standard deviations.\n\nB) The correlation coefficient of -0.45 indicates that 45% of the variance in academic performance can be explained by social media use.\n\nC) In a jointly normal distribution, an increase of one standard deviation in social media use is associated with a predicted decrease of 0.45 standard deviations in academic performance.\n\nD) The negative correlation means that for every hour increase in social media use, there will be a 0.45 point decrease in GPA.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of Pearson's correlation coefficient in terms of z-scores and its predictive interpretation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. It accurately reflects that the interpretation in terms of standard deviations is based on the assumption of a jointly normal distribution, which is not explicitly stated in the question but is a common assumption in social science research.\n\n2. It correctly states that the relationship is associative rather than causal, using the phrase \"is associated with\" instead of implying direct causation.\n\n3. It accurately describes the magnitude and direction of the relationship in terms of standard deviations: one standard deviation increase in X is associated with a 0.45 standard deviation decrease in Y.\n\n4. It avoids overgeneralization by using the term \"predicted\" rather than stating it as an absolute relationship.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states the relationship as exact and universal, without acknowledging the probabilistic nature of the prediction or the assumption of joint normality.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it confuses the correlation coefficient with the coefficient of determination (R-squared). While related, r = -0.45 would correspond to an R-squared of 0.2025 or 20.25%, not 45%.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it inappropriately translates the z-score relationship to raw scores (hours and GPA points) without considering the standard deviations of these variables. It also implies a direct causal relationship, which cannot be inferred from correlation alone.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the relationship between correlation and z-scores, the interpretation of the correlation coefficient in predictive contexts, and the importance of underlying distributional assumptions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/13", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/47499", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/24482/"], "docs_id": 47499, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the process of redoing my upstairs bathroom.

The correct answer (B) combines several key points:\n\n1. Using 1/2\" cement board, which the expert recommends for bathroom floors (\"I personally install 1/2\" durarock on bathroom floors\").\n2.

See, for example, [this paper](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/reviews/rpp2017-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf). There is a phenomenon called the \"[Bragg peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak)\" that seems to limit the energy deposition rate when an ion beam is passing through material, resulting in a large fraction of net energy being deposited in the last relatively small fraction of the beam path. So, if the ion energy is high enough, most of the beam energy ends up somewhere on the far side of a finite\\-thickness target like a human being.\n\nInteraction of a *single* particle with a human body, of course, is probabilistic. There's a finite chance the particle will interact with an atom near the start of its path through the body, and the same goes for its chances of interacting at any interval along its path. So, your question really asks whether or not destruction of everything along any specific very thin path through the body can kill. I doubt it, but am not sure. It seems very unlikely that destruction of, e.g., all the nerves along a sub\\-millimeter long straight path would kill.

Each of these corresponds to conservation of linear momentum in that dimension, resulting in n conserved linear momentum components.\n\n2.

It ensures that the two datasets are precisely aligned spatially, which is essential for accurate mask application and change detection.\n4. This method follows the advice given in the top answer, which recommends using the subset by file (or ROI) function to change the extent, rather than resizing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manually resizing to exact dimensions can lead to data distortion and doesn't address the underlying issue of different spatial extents. Option B would result in misaligned data and inaccurate analysis. Option D would introduce interpolation errors and is unnecessary given the availability of subsetting tools.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (image processing, spatial analysis, and change detection), applies to a real-world scenario in remote sensing, and tests the critical thinking skills needed to handle common issues in geospatial data analysis."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/31", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/266873", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/217521/"], "docs_id": 266873, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Office 365 keeps prompting for login credentials within Mac OSX?

This solution directly addresses the root cause of the problem by clearing out potentially corrupted or outdated credentials stored in the Mac's Keychain Access. \n\nDeleting Exchange, Office, and ADAL (Azure Active Directory Authentication Library) items from Keychain Access removes any conflicting or outdated authentication data that might be causing the repeated login prompts. Restarting the Mac ensures that all systems are cleared and reset before attempting to re-authenticate. \n\nThis method is preferred because:\n\n1. It maintains the existing installation, avoiding the need for a time-consuming reinstallation (unlike option A).\n2. It preserves the user's existing profile and data (unlike option C, which would require setting up everything from scratch).\n3. It does not compromise security by disabling important features like two-factor authentication (unlike option D, which would reduce account security).\n\nFurthermore, this solution aligns with official Microsoft troubleshooting steps, indicating it's a recognized and approved method for addressing authentication issues in Office 365 on Mac systems.

They want to create a balanced system that rewards both luck and strategy. Which of the following achievement designs would best meet these criteria while encouraging long-term player engagement?\n\nA) An achievement that requires players to collect a rare resource with a 0.1% spawn rate, but allows players to increase the spawn rate through in-game actions.\n\nB) An achievement awarded for defeating a boss that only appears once every 1000 hours of gameplay, with no way to influence its appearance.\n\nC) An achievement granted for crafting an item using materials that can only be obtained by completing daily quests for 30 consecutive days.\n\nD) An achievement unlocked by reaching the top of a leaderboard that resets monthly, where leaderboard position is determined by a combination of skill-based and random events.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of game design principles, integrating multiple concepts from the documentation. Option A best balances the luck-based nature of the original achievements with strategic elements that encourage long-term engagement:\n\n1. It mirrors the rarity aspect of the \"All-natural sugar cane\" achievement (harvesting a golden sugar lump) and the \"Last chance to see\" achievement (bursting a near-extinct shiny wrinkler).\n2. Unlike the original achievements, it provides players with agency to influence their chances, encouraging strategic play and long-term engagement.\n3. The low base spawn rate (0.1%) ensures the achievement remains challenging and luck-based, preserving the excitement of rare occurrences.\n4. The ability to increase spawn rates through in-game actions adds depth and rewards dedicated players, addressing the concern about achievements being \"just luck-based.\"\n\nOption B is purely luck-based with no strategic element, similar to the original achievements but lacking any player agency. Option C is entirely skill-based and time-gated, removing the luck element entirely. Option D introduces competition but doesn't directly relate to the original achievement concepts and may discourage casual players.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about game design principles, requiring candidates to evaluate how different achievement systems balance luck, skill, and player engagement."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/11/15", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/433561", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/251289/"], "docs_id": 433561, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My question will be mostly about Linux and contemporary X86 hardware.\n\nClarifying the terms\n--------------------\n\n**async event based programming:** spawning fixed amount of threads and using some user space scheduling mechanism. Usually callbacks are handled in a continuation style, so the callback will be executed in the thread of the consumer, not producer.\n\n**thread, blocking based programming:** using classic OS threads and mutexes and semaphores. Waiting is handled by blocking the calling thread. Although not usually used, in my perspective this requires *cooperative threads* to be effective.\n\nThe status quo from my POV\n--------------------------\n\nIt seems like more and more people turn away from the classic way of using syncrhonization/cooperation primitives for threading and from blocking (as in making current thread sleep) in general. Their problems seems to be mainly based on the following (italics are my thoughts on the matter):\n\n* Blocking synchronization is prone to deadlocks (*async code can livelock too*)\n* Too many threads cause oversubscription and OS scheduler makes latency sky high (*fixable?*)\n* Whatever libraries that use threading do not provide any way of cooperation, thus causing the problem above\n* High cost of a thread spin\\-up (*perceived?*)\n* Not usable if sleep/wakeup is noticeable compared to active time (*true*)\n\n\\#5 is not fixable without patching kernel and \\#3 could be fixed by better teaching.\n\nThe can of worms\n----------------\n\nAsync systems usually rely on events that trigger something else, thus cascading. Even if the above problems were fixed by async event based programming, it creates harder issues that are solvable by blocking thread based programming:\n\n* Starvation (very hard to achieve fairness without OS support, which in turn utilizes hardware clocks to enforce CPU time slices)\n* Can break when only one worker is allocated (this is mostly true of lock free queues, nothing can cause progress condition when the worker is not giving CPU time to another task, although this is solved with coroutines)\n* Exclusivity and ABA problems (with OS threads no thread can be scheduled on multiple CPUs at the same time, while with event based programming some event might be fired more than needed)\n* Complexity either goes into the library (which, if written with poor interface, pretty much doubles the mental complexity) or into the user code\n\nWhy reinvent the wheel?\n-----------------------\n\nFor most complaints I have seen with thread based blocking programming, I couldn't find any reason why it couldn't be solved with classic approach. The only problem is when a thread needs to run for so small amount of time that typical \\~10 microsecond delay will start becoming noticable. It is usually I/O bound applications. On all other cases I found that non\\-blocking code is usually less efficient on the normal path (non contending), because it does more operations to ensure atomicity. It seems like almost all problems could be solved by using blocking in a better way (don't hold lock for more than very few operations) and exposing parallelism instead of just spawning threads (algorithms could use task queues, for example). Real\\-time is not possible without preemption, so async event driven code is not real\\-time by definition. Even the coroutine based frameworks pretty much duplicate the OS scheduler and synchronization primitives.\n\nExamples when threads are superior\n----------------------------------\n\nOn one occasion I had to utilize only 2 CPU cores for a stream of tasks, where some tasks take about 100 times longer than the others. Having two of those would pretty much stop anything from making progress. I did the following:\n\n1. Allocate two threads for lightweight tasks and make the producers put lightweight tasks into a queue\n2. Spin up a thread for every heavy task\n3. Put everything under `SCHED_RR` with a timeslice set to upperbound of a lightweight task, so that even in case of heavier tasks, lighter ones could make progress\n\nFor async event based programming, this would require support from the callee, and it would have predefined amount of preemption points, while OS based one is a pretty much coroutine with as many preemption points as possible, albeit with less control over where exactly it will be preempted.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\nSince async event driven programming offers so little benefits, why is there shift towards it? What am I missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"async\" approach better facilitates human reasoning.\n========================================================\n\nWhen most people drive, they don't need to concern themselves with how every element of the car is interacting. Forget the tires \\- when you turn the steering wheel, the car turns. Sure, there are exceptional cases where you need to remember that the tires exist, and you need to keep the big picture in your head to avoid big errors. But for the most part, that's background knowledge that won't help you get to the store and back.\n\nTechnology grows to cover the pain points\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn computing as a whole, things tend to move from \"easy for the machine\" to \"easy for the person\". User\\-friendliness (noting that developers are the users of programming technologies) is obviously valuable, so as technology and discipline develop, patterns tend toward the human.\n\nIn programming languages, for example, we've generally moved from \"low\" to \"high\"; machine to assembly to `C` to `C++` to `C#`, for example (not that each is specifically an iteration of its predecessor, but as a general direction). Early languages tended to be more dynamic, because it's easy to interpret a dynamic language, whereas many modern languages tend to come with more compile\\-time checks and pre\\-processing. Obviously dynamic and low\\-level languages are still valuable \\- especially in specific situations \\- but the benefits of things like generic types, garbage collection, and syntactic sugar are undeniable for most software development.\n\nSeparate the model from the mechanism\n-------------------------------------\n\nAlso look at cloud computing \\- have you heard the buzzword \"serverless\"? Obviously there's still a server, but the details of its hardware can be safely ignored in most situations. With architectural patterns like microservices, there's more and more push toward completely isolating different areas of an application domain; each piece is maintained as a black box and coordination is only required at the edges. This is supported and enforced by cloud resources like Azure Functions or AWS Lambda that may not run anywhere near one\\-another in time and space. Coordinating all of these pieces turns out to be *a distraction* from software design and development rather than a fundamental building block.\n\nThis extends naturally to concurrent programming. It's easier to think \"pick up here when data is available\" than it is to think about scheduling whose turn it is and ensuring that timing works out. Software design principles suggest focusing on a single responsibility, and part of that is keeping the details coordination out of a given chain of events.\n\nFeatures like `async` and `await` or promise `then` callbacks build upon low\\-level thread coordination the way loops build on `goto`. They behave in a structured, consistent way that is more limited and with somewhat more overhead, but are ultimately more predictable and quick to use in typical scenarios. When I write `getValue().then(useValue)`, I can assume that code will execute in that order as time progresses, albeit with a time disconnect. Maybe the actual *thread* could run other code in the meantime \\- why should I care!"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is designing a system to process a stream of tasks where some tasks take 100 times longer than others.

For example the following fictional session snippet:\n\n```\n#Please cd to /tmp\n$ cd /tmp\n#This is a place to store stuff that is just for currently running programs, using the handy filesystem.

I get your idea but I've been working with Linux/Unix for the better part of 30\\+ years and continue to learn things every day that leave me wondering how I hadn't learned this bit yet.\n\nI will leave you with this though. Most of the help that one requires on Linux/Unix is already contained within the system. The man pages and info pages are pretty much the owners manual to your system.\n\nThese commands will get you started:\n\n```\n$ man man\n\n$ man -a intro\n\n$ man -k <some topic>\n\n$ man <command>\n\n$ info <command>\n\n```\n\nMost people don't realize that you can learn about how the man pages are organized through the use of man. Try `man man` to gain more insight into how they're laid out.\n\n```\nMANUAL SECTIONS\n       The standard sections of the manual include:\n\n       1      User Commands\n       2      System Calls\n       3      C Library Functions\n       4      Devices and Special Files\n       5      File Formats and Conventions\n       6      Games et. Al.\n       7      Miscellanea\n       8      System Administration tools and Daemons\n\n```\n\nSo if you have questions about commands, focus on the man pages in section 1\\. If you have questions about the file format conventions, look to section 5\\.\n\n```\n$ man -S ls\n\n```\n\n### Koans\n\nI kind of backed into [Koans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) through [Ruby where I first learned](http://rubykoans.com/) about them. They are snippets of a problem that teach you a concept in X. \n\n*excerpt from wikipedia*\n\n> A k\u014dan (\u516c\u6848?)/\u02c8ko\u028a.\u0251\u02d0n/; Chinese: \u516c\u6848; pinyin: g\u014dng'\u00e0n; Korean: \uacf5\uc548\n>  (kong'an); Vietnamese: c\u00f4ng \u00e1n) is a story, dialogue, question, or\n>  statement, which is used in Zen\\-practice to provoke the \"great doubt\",\n>  and test a student's progress in Zen practice.\n\nIn my case it was with the [programming language Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but Unix also has them.\n\nThe ones that I'm most familiar with for Unix are the ones known as [Rootless Root](http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/introduction.html). Poking around that site you'll likely find these koans titled: [The Unix Power Classic: A book about the Unix Way and its power](http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/upc/). If you want to gain an understanding for Unix I suggest you read them. \n\n### Application docs\n\nYou can often find documentation on the various software installed on a Linux system under this directory, `/usr/share/doc`.

The correct answer, D, aligns best with Unix philosophy and leverages existing resources while addressing the goal of creating an interactive learning experience.\n\nOption A, while seemingly addressing the original request, goes against the Unix philosophy of using existing tools and would require significant development effort.\n\nOption B misses the interactive aspect and doesn't fully utilize the existing comprehensive man page system.\n\nOption C, while creative, may be too abstract for beginners and doesn't directly address the need for practical filesystem knowledge.\n\nOption D combines the power of existing documentation (man and info pages) with the interactive, guided approach the junior admin is seeking. It respects the Unix tradition of self-documentation through man pages, as highlighted in the answer. By creating exercises that guide users to explore relevant man pages (e.g., man man, man -a intro, man -k <topic>), learners can discover the filesystem structure and command usage organically. This approach also teaches users how to find information independently, a crucial skill in Unix/Linux environments.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the candidate to evaluate different approaches, consider the Unix philosophy, and understand the value of existing documentation systems in Linux."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/08", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/237625", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/60063/"], "docs_id": 237625, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a fresh Magento 2 setup in my system.

After following the steps outlined in the documentation, including modifying XML files and refreshing caches, the new currency still doesn't appear in the \"Allowed Currencies\" dropdown. What is the most likely reason for this issue, and what approach should the developer take to resolve it?\n\nA) The changes were made directly to core files, which Magento ignores for security reasons. The developer should create a custom module instead.\nB) The currency code \"ZZZ\" is reserved by Magento and cannot be used. The developer needs to choose a different code.\nC) The developer forgot to update the currency exchange rates.

The developer needs to override the TranslatedLists class to add custom currencies.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution presented in the documentation involves creating a custom module and overriding Magento's core TranslatedLists class. This approach is necessary because Magento's built-in currency handling is not easily extensible through simple XML modifications. \n\nThe correct solution involves:\n1. Creating a new module or using an existing one.\n2. Implementing a custom Model (e.g., AddCurrencies) that extends TranslatedLists.\n3.

The correct answer, B, is the most effective and safe approach for several reasons:\n\n1. It doesn't require applying significant force, which is crucial when working on a ladder (addressing the safety concern mentioned in the question).\n2.

The key issue is that the difference between f(n) = n/log(n) and n^(log_b(a)) = n^(log_2(2)) = n is neither polynomially larger nor smaller.\n\nIn the Master Theorem, we compare f(n) to n^(log_b(a)) to determine which case applies.

This subtle difference in growth rates creates a \"gap\" that the Master Theorem is not designed to handle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because f(n) = n/log(n) is indeed polynomially bounded.

Given that most modern iOS devices use higher resolutions and the impending release of iOS 10, which approach would be most effective for comprehensive testing?\n\nA) Use the iPad 2 simulator with iOS 9.3 to test @1x views, and physical devices for higher resolutions\nB) Rely solely on physical devices, as simulators no longer support @1x resolutions\nC) Update the app to support @2x and @3x resolutions, then test on modern device simulators\nD) Use the iPhone 4s simulator, as it's the last iPhone to support @1x resolution\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given information and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that most iOS devices don't support @1x views, indicating a shift towards higher resolutions.\n2. It's stated that no device will likely support @1x with iOS 10, suggesting future incompatibility.\n3. While the iPad 2 simulator with iOS 9.3 supports @1x views (as mentioned in the answer), this is not a comprehensive solution for modern app development.\n4. Updating the app to support @2x and @3x resolutions addresses both current and future device compatibility issues.\n5. Testing on modern device simulators after updating would provide more relevant and comprehensive test coverage.\n\nOption A is partially correct but doesn't address future compatibility. Option B is incorrect as simulators are still valuable for testing. Option D is a distractor based on outdated information, as the iPhone 4s isn't mentioned in the documentation and wouldn't be suitable for future-proofing the app. This question tests the developer's ability to analyze the situation, consider future trends, and make a decision that best serves the app's long-term viability and testing needs."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/08/16", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/572931", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/430728/"], "docs_id": 572931, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a word to describe the action of accidentally mixing two words together, such as exclaiming *trampede* when struggling to explain what cattle do.

The professor didn't intend to create a new word, ruling out options A and B, which describe intentional word creation. It's not a malapropism (option D) because the blended words are semantically related to the intended concept.\n\nThe blend of \"vocabulary\" and \"utterance\" into \"vocabuttery\" demonstrates the parallel activation of related lexical items during speech production. This supports psycholinguistic theories about how the brain processes and produces language. Such errors provide insight into the mental lexicon and the cognitive processes involved in word selection and articulation.\n\nThis example also illustrates the difference between unintentional blends and intentional portmanteaus, a key distinction made in the original documentation.

The analyst runs a query using ST_Intersection on Geography objects but gets unexpected results. What is the most likely explanation for this issue, and how should the analyst modify their approach?\n\nA) The default spatial reference system is incorrect; the analyst should explicitly set SRID 4326 for all Geography objects.\nB) ST_Intersection is not designed for Geography objects; the analyst should convert to Geometry type first.\nC) PostGIS is using planar calculations instead of spherical; the analyst should use ST_Intersects with a specified tolerance.\nD) The Great Circle paths are being approximated as straight lines; the analyst should use ST_SegmentizeFragments before intersection.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key issue here is that PostGIS is not automatically considering the curvature of the Earth when calculating intersections of Geography objects. The query result suggests that straight lines are being used instead of Great Circle paths, which is why the intersection point is not where expected (in Canada).\n\nTo address this, the analyst should use ST_SegmentizeFragments before performing the intersection. This function will break down the Great Circle path into smaller segments that better approximate the curved path on a sphere. By doing this pre-processing step, the subsequent ST_Intersection operation will work with a more accurate representation of the flight paths, leading to a result that correctly accounts for the Earth's curvature.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Geography objects, Great Circle paths, intersection calculations), applies to a real-world scenario (flight path analysis), and tests critical thinking about how GIS operations handle spherical geometry.

I can see it both as conflicting with the author's intent and just some general housekeeping.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR \\- This isn't an acceptable edit (even knowing this works for both Python versions)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's talk about the moving parts here for a second. See below for a more detailed talk about this specific issue\n\n1. The question is version agnostic. It uses the generic [python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python \"show questions tagged 'python'\") tag\n2. The answer clearly answers the question. It's accepted and decently upvoted\n3. Python is a bit weird in the 2\\.X vs 3\\.X split. There's two ways to do a lot of things.\n\nEdits **should not replace working code**, even if the methodology is obsolete. The catch here is it **removed** the 2\\.X answer for a 3\\.X answer. New answers come along all the time, but this should either\n\n1. Be a comment\n2. Be another answer\n\nBoth are valid reasons to reject this.\n\n---\n\nI'm editing this in because there's a different sub\\-issue here: the edit was valid syntax in both versions. I'll use this from MisterMiyagi's [post](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421315/19123103), since it's concise:\n\n> It is important that the change does not invalidate the previous answer scope: a single\\-argument `print` is backwards compatible to Python 2\\.\n\nThe early voting that's happening in this Meta seems to be related to that sentiment. Another [comment of his](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421310/are-edits-from-python-2s-print-to-python-3s-print-acceptable#comment932820_421315):\n\n> Yes, I expect some level of subject matter expertise from edit reviewers. Having to judge whether two versions are the technically equivalent is frequently required, not just for code changes. Knowing that `print(x)` will work in both versions of Python does not seem exceptional to me.\n\nTherein lies the problem: you can't expect that. The Suggested Edit queue is, hands down, the most clogged queue we have. There's a hard limit of 500 edits allowed to sit in there. We need reviewers, and we cannot demand that only subject matter experts (SMEs) review what they already know. That would mean you only review a handful of things. Per [the FAQ entry](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/260246/2370483)\n\n> If changing the syntax errors or typos would result in the code doing something other than what the answer says it will, consider creating a comment or a separate answer explaining your change. If posting another answer with only that change seems like it won't provide added value to future visitors, it probably doesn't change logic or functionality and should be an edit instead.\n\nThis isn't a typo, it's simply another way to express the same thing. But adding parenthesis isn't something you just do in most languages. That's control syntax you're dealing with, and just because Python will accept it with or without parenthesis **does not mean it should be approved**. From the same FAQ entry (emphasis mine)\n\n> If you do not have 2,000 reputation allowing you to edit without review, you should be sure to include a good Edit Summary. **Reviewers may not be an expert in the language you are submitting an edit for, and may click 'Reject' if they aren't sure if your edit meets these guidelines.** Adding a good Edit Summary will help minimize the chance of them making the wrong decision.\n\nWhat was the edit message here?\n\n> fixed links and print statement for python3\n\nAs someone with a lot of reviews under my belt, I see this a lot, where some new user makes a suggested edit to \"fix\" code (and, in cases where I am an SME, I sometimes facepalm at their \"fixes\"). Reviewers cannot be required to know if the suggested syntax will work and so our position is **we err on the side of rejection**. This just happens to be one of the rare times where the edit makes no syntactical difference.\n\n> \"Adding a separate entry for the Python 3 way \u2026\" This seems quite frankly excessive to me. We're talking about a single pair of parenthesis. The syntax has no bearing at all on the actual problem of the Q\\&A, an answer specifically with explanations for Python3 syntax would add nothing but distraction.\n\nA good edit here will either [explain the syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12162629/using-print-the-function-version-in-python2-x), or be a separate post ([example with different syntax for the same thing](https://stackoverflow.com/q/163092/2370483))."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about StackExchange editing practices, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer suggests an edit to a 10-year-old Python answer on Stack Overflow, changing the print statement from Python 2 syntax (print x) to Python 3 syntax (print(x)). As a reviewer, what is the most appropriate action to take, considering Stack Overflow's guidelines and the potential impact on future visitors?\n\nA) Approve the edit, as it updates the code to a more current Python version\nB) Reject the edit and suggest adding a separate answer for the Python 3 version\nC) Reject the edit as conflicting with the author's intent, but add a comment explaining the Python 3 syntax\nD) Approve the edit only if the original question specifically asked for Python 3 solutions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of Stack Overflow's editing guidelines and consideration of multiple factors. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Stack Overflow guidelines state that edits should not replace working code, even if the methodology is obsolete. The original Python 2 syntax was correct and functional.\n\n2. Rejecting the edit preserves the author's original intent and maintains the answer's validity for Python 2 users.\n\n3.

Is *more* here acting as an adverb or a determiner? And isn't this a comma splice since each clause has a subject with no conjunction to link them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The parsing of the sentence in the question is ambiguous. There is no single, clear\\-cut way of looking at it.\n\n---\n\nBefore directly addressing the actual sentence, consider this:\n\n> 1\\. They are cooking apples.\n\n* They \u2192 pronoun, referring to people\n* are \u2192 auxiliary verb\n* cooking \u2192 verb\n* apples \u2192 noun\n\n> 2\\. They are cooking apples.\n\n* They \u2192 pronoun, referring to apples\n* are \u2192 verb\n* cooking \u2192 adjective\n* apples \u2192 noun\n\nSo, which is it? What grammatical function does *cooking* serve? The answer is *we don't know*. It would be resolved by context, but the grammar of the sentence itself, as a single sentence, changes depending on how it is viewed or interpreted. Or how it's parsed.\n\n---\n\nThe same holds true of the particular sentence in the question. What does it mean?\n\nThere is more than one way of interpreting it.\n\n---\n\n> **1\\. The more you have, the more you want.**\n> \n> \n> \u2192 If you have more, dependent clause then you want more. independent clause\n\nBut, as a comment under the question asked, how can *the more you want* be an independent clause, something that stands on its own? It can be if it's *parsed* to be:\n\n> The more you want.\n> \n> \n> \u2192 You want the more.  \n> \n>  \u2192 You want more.\n\nThis simply changes the word order, and then drops the article that would not normally be used.\n\nWhile the specific wording of the original and the restated version with the article are not idiomatic as sentences, they nonetheless would be phrased as the final version *you want more* if that's what the original was interpreted to mean.\n\nMany sentences that appear unusual, or even wrong, are still acceptable in archaic forms of English, or where the traditional SVO (Subject Verb Object) order has been changed. You might not normally use them, but they don't actually violate syntax. The reversed word order of Yoda in the *Star Wars* movies is famous for rearranging words in an order that sounds strange and would not normally be used, but which is still technically grammatical.\n\nGrammatical but strange such sentences are.\n\nThe problem with considering *only* the second half of the sentence in question, and considering it as an independent clause, is that the first half of the sentence is required in order to understand *why* it might be considered an independent clause.\n\nIf the *only* thing you are exposed to is the second half of the sentence, it's highly unlikely it would make sense to treat it as an independent clause; it's more likely it would be considered a noun phrase\u2014or sentence fragment.\n\nBut when analyzing the sentence as a whole, and parsing possible meanings, you have to consider the entire context.\n\n---\n\n> **2\\. The more you have, the more you want.**\n> \n> \n> \u2192 Having more means wanting more. a single independent clause\n\nIt's easier to understand why this rephrased version is a single independent clause\u2014because, unlike in the other interpretation, the wording here sounds natural.\n\nMy personal opinion (and it's entirely subjective) is that this is the least complicated way of parsing the sentence. Perhaps because of this, it's also the way in which I would normally look at it.\n\nAs in the analysis of the first interpretation, and how a changed word order didn't *necessarily* result in something ungrammatical, the fact that there's a comma in its original form doesn't necessarily mean that there's a dependent clause. It depends on how it's interpreted.\n\n---\n\nThere is a third interpretation of the sentence that could be given, and, following from the second interpretation, it supports the idea of a comma splice:\n\n> **3\\. The more you have, the more you want.**\n> \n> \n> \u2192 You have more, independent clause you want more. independent clause\n\nBut being a comma splice wouldn't necessarily mean it's an error. Some comma splices are stylistically acceptable:\n\n> I came, I saw, I conquered.  \n> \n>  It's not a bird, it's a plane.\n\nComma splices that involve very short clauses, generally with the same subject, are often considered acceptable as a form of deliberate style. However, it's true that not everybody accepts them in any form.\n\nDepending on if you accept any form of comma splice, and if you parse the sentence in the question in this way, then you might decide it's incorrect.\n\n---\n\nThere could be other interpretations I haven't thought of.\n\nChanging how you interpret (or parse) the sentence changes the grammatical functions of its components. Just as different interpretations of *cooking apples* changes the grammatical function of *cooking*.\n\nNormally, sentences aren't as grammatically ambiguous as this.\n\nThere is no way of giving an answer that is unarguably the correct interpretation and, therefore, the correct analysis in terms of which parts of this sentence break down into what types of clauses."}, "answer": "Certainly!

The correct answer, D, reflects the most sophisticated analysis presented in the documentation.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that the sentence is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways, each affecting how it's grammatically parsed. This ambiguity is similar to the \"cooking apples\" example provided, where context determines interpretation.\n\nOption A oversimplifies the analysis, ignoring the potential for other valid interpretations. While a comma splice is one possible interpretation, it's not the only or necessarily the best one.\n\nOption B represents one possible interpretation mentioned in the documentation, but it's not the only valid one. Choosing this would ignore the broader analysis provided.\n\nOption C is another valid interpretation discussed, viewing the sentence as expressing a correlative relationship. However, selecting this as the only correct answer would again overlook the sentence's inherent ambiguity.\n\nOption D captures the essence of the linguistic analysis provided in the documentation. It acknowledges that depending on how one interprets the sentence, different grammatical analyses can be justified.

The foam can disperse either by the bubbles popping as they are exposed to the 'air' above the surface, or by the vapour in the bubble cooling and the bubble collapsing (if the surface of the liquid and surrounding air is below the liquid's boiling point).\n\nBut if it is heated too quickly then the foam doesn't disperse as fast as it collects. New bubbles are trapped below a surface layer of existing foam \\- because they are not exposed to the air they don't pop, and because the foam is a good insulator they don't cool so quickly and therefore don't collapse. Even if foam production is initially only slightly faster than foam dispersion there can be a runaway reaction as the gathering foam has a negative feed\\-back on foam dispersion. \n\nAt he same time, the foam layer now reduces evaporation from the surface of the milk, so it heats faster for the same thermal input from your stove element. The upper surface in particular will heat up rapidly as that was the region that was kept coldest by evaporation before the foam layer started to form. So the foam layer (as well as acting as negative feedback on foam dispersal) also acts as positive feedback on liquid temperature and therefore on foam production rate. \n\nWhen cooking pasta \\- a common 'trick' to stop the pasta water from boiling over in the same way, is to add a teaspoon of oil to the water \\- that stops foam from forming so the feedback effect never starts."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A food scientist is developing a new cooking method for milk-based sauces.

That name resolution is working fine because curl reports that it cannot reach network 2800:3f0:4001:806::1005; this shows that the name translation did succeed. This is different than an error in name lookup:\n\n```\n $ curl -6 http://does.not.exist.foo.\n curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'does.not.exist.foo.'\n\n```\n\nIn order to reach an IPv6 address, you need to have a route to the destination address and very few connections have any IPv6 connectivity at all.

The curl command to https://google.com times out with a \"network unreachable\" error, but works fine when forcing IPv4 with -4 option. What is the most likely root cause of this issue, and what approach should be taken to enable normal IPv6 functionality?\n\nA) The system's DNS resolver is failing to return IPv6 addresses; updating the /etc/resolv.conf file should resolve the issue.\nB) The curl version on Ubuntu 10.10 has a bug in IPv6 support; upgrading to a newer curl version should fix the problem.\nC) The system lacks proper IPv6 routing configuration; adding IPv6 routes, particularly a default route, is necessary.\nD) The network interface is not configured for IPv6; enabling IPv6 in the network configuration file will solve the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue is not related to name resolution or curl functionality, but rather to the lack of proper IPv6 routing on the system. This can be deduced from several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The error message \"Failed to connect to 2800:3f0:4001:806::1005: Network is unreachable\" indicates that DNS resolution for IPv6 is working (as it successfully resolved the IPv6 address), but the network stack cannot reach the destination.\n\n2. The comparison with IPv4 routing tables shows that a crucial piece of information is missing for IPv6: the default route. In IPv4, there's a default gateway (0.0.0.0 route to 192.168.1.1), which is absent in the IPv6 routing table.\n\n3. The documentation explicitly states: \"You do need an IPv6 route to the destination network and too few places provide that facility yet.\"\n\nTo resolve this issue, the system needs proper IPv6 routing configuration, particularly a default IPv6 route. This would typically involve:\n\n1. Ensuring that the network provides IPv6 connectivity (which may not be the case in all environments).\n2. Configuring the system to obtain or set an IPv6 default route, possibly through router advertisements or manual configuration.\n3. Verifying the IPv6 routing table to ensure it includes a route to reach external IPv6 addresses.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex networking scenario, integrate multiple concepts (IPv6, routing, network connectivity), and apply troubleshooting skills in a real-world context.

One as transmitter and the other as receiver. In order to do that, I combined each with a MCP2551 transceiver. As long as the CAN operating Mode was set to LOOPBACK everything seemed to be good: The controller were able to send CAN messages, receive them(their own), and send it via UART to my PC (worked well). As next step I wanted to let them communicate with eachother. I set the operating mode of them to NORMAL. While the transmitter was sending the same messages as in Loopback Mode, and the Receiver was sending nothing (just waiting for any messages to come in), nothing happened. A measurement showed constant 2,5V at the transceivers output (Recessive State), and constant 3,3V at the STM32 TX (PA12\\). Anyone an idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> One as transmitter and the other as receiver\n\nIt doesn't work that way. CAN is a peer to peer network. Any node can send a message at any time, and all the other nodes on the network receive the message.\n\n> constant 3,3V at the STM32 TX\n\nThis is clearly a firmware bug. The signal isn't getting to the CAN bus transceiver chip, let alone the CAN bus itself.\n\nThings to be aware of:\n\n- The CAN lines need to be pulled together by about 60 \u03a9. That should be 120 \u03a9 at each end of the bus. If the bus is really short, like a few inches on a single PC board, then a single 60 \u03a9 resistor can be acceptable.\n\nOn a real bus, this terminates the line to avoid reflections. However, this \"termination\" is still required even when the whole system is lumped. The resistance functions as a pull\\-together to keep the bus in the recessive state when not explicitly driven to the dominant state. This termination is not optional, even when it has nothing to do with terminating the transmission line.\n\n- You need at least two functioning nodes to have a working CAN bus. This is because the transmitter of a message expects to see the ACK bit asserted. With nothing but the transmitter on the bus, nothing will assert ACK, and the transmitter will think the message was corrupted and resend it. But see point 3\\.\n\n- The CAN standard attempts to prevent broken nodes from taking down the whole bus. If a node sees too many error conditions, it will shut itself down for a while. If you have only one node that never sees ACK, some of this error logic might get tripped after a while. I don't remember off the top of my head what conditions cause what level of disabling, but not having a full bus could cause the single node to disable itself, at least somewhat."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about CAN bus communication, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is troubleshooting a CAN bus system where two STM32 microcontrollers, each connected to an MCP2551 transceiver, are failing to communicate.

In a discussion a colleague told me about a special forcing by Solovay which begins with a countable transitive model of $ZFC$ and reaches to an \"uncountable\" transitive generic model. My question is about these kind of special forcings and their possible special uses.\n\n**Question:** Please introduce a reference about any use of forcing with at least one of the below characteristics:\n\n**(a)** The ground model is uncountable.\n\n**(b)** The ground model is not transitive.\n\n**(c)** The generic model is uncountable.\n\n**(d)** The generic model is not transitive.\n\n**(e)** The generic model has more ordinals than ground model. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't agree that the \"usual\" use of forcing uses only countable transitive models. Perhaps this used to be true, years ago, and forcing is sometimes still taught this way now, because it is somewhat easier to see where the generic filters come from, but neither hypothesis is actually needed to develop a full theory of forcing, and I think that these days it is quite common to understand forcing as an internal ZFC construction that works over any model, not just the countable transitive models.\n\nFor example, the Boolean\\-value approach to forcing allows us to make sense of forcing over the universe, within ZFC. One defines the Boolean values $\\[\\\\!\\[\\\\varphi]\\\\!]$ for any formula $\\\\varphi$ in the forcing language, by induction on $\\\\varphi$. This allows one to speak of which statements are forceable or not over any model of set theory, and suffices for the consistency proofs. \n\nMeanwhile, one can turn the Boolean\\-valued model $V^{\\\\mathbb{B}}$ into an actual classical 2\\-valued model simply by taking the quotient by an ultrafilter $U\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{B}$, and there is no need for $U$ to be $V$\\-generic in this process, and even $U\\\\in V$ is completely fine. The elements of the quotient are the equivalence classes with respect to the relation $\\\\sigma\\\\sim\\_U\\\\tau\\\\iff \\[\\\\!\\[\\\\sigma\\=\\\\tau]\\\\!]\\\\in U$. This is not the same as the usual value $\\\\text{val}(\\\\sigma,U)$ assignment, except when $U$ is $V$\\-generic. This gives rise to the Boolean ultrapower map $j:V\\\\to \\\\check V\\_U$, defined by $j:x\\\\mapsto \\[\\\\check x]\\_U$, which is an elementary embedding of $V$ into the class model $\\\\check V\\_U$, and $\\\\check V\\_U$ has its forcing extension $\\\\check V\\_U\\[G]$ as a class inside $V$. The generic object $G$ is simply the equivalence class of the *name* of the generic object $G\\=\\[\\\\dot G]\\_U$. Thus, one never needs to leave $V$ to speak of the forcing extensions of $V$. When there are large cardinals, one can even arrange that $\\\\check V\\_U$ is transitive, and these Boolean ultrapowers can be viewed as large cardinal embeddings. \n\nDan Seabold and I give a fairly thorough account of the Boolean ultrapower in our paper [Boolean ultrapowers as large cardinal embeddings](http://jdh.hamkins.org/boolean-ultrapowers/). In particular, this paper contains examples of all of the types of examples you request. \n\n**Update.** Here is an example that may be more like what you had wanted. \n\n**Theorem.** If there is a supercompact cardinal, then there is transitive inner model, containing all ordinals, with a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. Similarly, there is an inner model with a supercompact cardinal $\\\\kappa$ for which $2^\\\\kappa\\=\\\\kappa^\\+$ and another with a supercompact cardinal $\\\\kappa$ for which $2^\\\\kappa\\>\\\\kappa^\\+$. \n\nProof. These results and others like it appear in [A. Apter, V. Gitman, J. D. Hamkins, \u201cInner models with large cardinal features usually obtained by forcing,\u201d Archive for Mathematical Logic, 51(2012\\):257\\-283](http://jdh.hamkins.org/innermodelswithlargecardinals/). Suppose that $\\\\kappa$ is supercompact in $V$. Let $j:V\\\\to M$ be a $\\\\theta$\\-supercompactness embedding for some $\\\\theta$ for which $2^{\\\\theta^{\\\\lt\\\\kappa}}\\=\\\\theta^\\+$. (This is possible because the SCH holds above any supercompact cardinal.) Let $\\\\mathbb{P}$ be the Laver preparation forcing for $j(\\\\kappa)$ as defined in $M$, but starting above $\\\\theta$. Thus, $\\\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\\\leq\\\\theta$\\-closed in $M$ and hence also in $V$, and by counting we can see that there are only $\\\\theta^\\+$ many dense subsets of $\\\\mathbb{P}$ in $V$. So in $V$ we may construct an $M$\\-generic filter $G\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}$. Thus, $M\\[G]$ is a transitive inner model of $V$ in which $j(\\\\kappa)$ is a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. By also combining $\\\\mathbb{P}$ with further forcing, we can ensure that the GCH holds or fails at $j(\\\\kappa)$, or a variety of other situations. QED\n\nThe general theorem here is the following, where a partial order $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\\\lt\\\\kappa$\\-friendly, if for every $\\\\delta\\\\lt\\\\kappa$, there is a condition below which $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ adds no new subsets to $\\\\delta$. \n\n**Theorem.**(Seabold, Hamkins) If $\\\\kappa$ is strongly compact, then for any $\\\\lt\\\\kappa$\\-friendly notion of forcing, there is a transitive inner model satisfying every sentence forced by $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ over $V$. \n\nThe proof uses Boolean ultrapowers, and the point is that strong compactness is enough to enable one to find a well\\-founded Boolean ultrapower."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a high-quality multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A set theorist is developing a new forcing technique to study large cardinal properties.

This uses the fundamental group and a variation on Van Kampen, but not homology. So this probably still won't be satisfying to you, but it doesn't use Alexander duality (which is the normal way to do this). \n\nBy removing a point from the knot, we may assume that we have a properly embedded line $L\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3$. Suppose that $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$ is disconnected. Since $L$ is closed, $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$ is open, and since it is disconnected, there are disjoint non\\-empty open subsets $U, V$ such that $U\\\\cup V\\=\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\-L$. Now embed $\\\\mathbb{R}^3\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^4$, with coordinates $(x,y,z,w)$, and $w\\=0$ gives $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$. Then $\\\\pi\\_1(\\\\mathbb{R}^4\\-L)$ is non\\-trivial.

Using a generalized version of Van Kampen's theorem to show that \u03c0\u2081(R\u2074-L) is non-trivial if the complement in R\u00b3 were disconnected.\n4. Contradicting this by showing R\u2074-L is actually simply connected through a homeomorphism.\n\nThis approach avoids using Alexander Duality or assuming tameness/smoothness of the knot. Option A is incorrect because the Jordan Curve Theorem applies to 2D and can't be directly used for 3D knots. Option C is unsuitable as it assumes tameness, which the question specifically wants to avoid. Option D, while intuitive, doesn't provide a rigorous proof and might not work for all types of knots.\n\nThis question requires integrating multiple concepts (knot theory, fundamental groups, Van Kampen's theorem) and tests the ability to analyze and apply topological reasoning in a novel context, targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/06", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/55334", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/92/"], "docs_id": 55334, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Every once in a while I'm asked in interviews which I like the best\\- low level or high level.

In particular, it is suggested that FP languages are not very suitable for modelling (persistent) objects that have an identity and a mutable state.\n\nI was wondering if this is true or, in other words, how one would model objects in a functional programming language. From my basic knowledge of Haskell I thought that one could use monads in some way, but I really do not know enough on this topic to come up with a clear answer.\n\nSo, how are entities with an identity and a mutable persistent state normally modelled in a functional language?\n\nHere are some further details to clarify what I have in mind. Take a typical Java application in which I can (1\\) read a record from a database table into a Java object, (2\\) modify the object in different ways, (3\\) save the modified object to the database.\n\nHow would this be implemented e.g. in Haskell? I would initially read the record into a record value (defined by a data definition), perform different transformations by applying functions to this initial value (each intermediate value is a new, modified copy of the original record) and then write the final record value to the database.\n\nIs this all there is to it? How can I ensure that at each moment in time only one copy of the record is valid / accessible? One does not want to have different immutable values representing different snapshots of the same object to be accessible at the same time.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The usual way to go about state changes in a pure language like Haskell is to model them as functions that take the old state and return a modified version. Even for complex objects, this is efficient because of Haskell's lazy evaluation strategy \\- even though you are syntactically creating a new object, it is not copied in its entirety; each field is evaluated only when it is needed.\n\nIf you have more than a few local state changes, things can become clumsy, which is where monads come in. The monad paradigm can be used to encapsulate a state and its changes; the textbook example is the `State` monad that comes with a standard Haskell install. Note, however, that a monad is nothing special: it's just a data type that exposes two methods (`>>=` and `return`), and meets a few expectations (the 'monad laws'). Under the hood, the State monad does exactly the same: take the old state and return a modified state; only the syntax is nicer."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about functional programming and modeling objects with mutable state, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A team is transitioning from an object-oriented Java application to a functional Haskell implementation. They need to model a user account that can be retrieved from a database, modified, and then saved back. Which approach best represents how this would be implemented in Haskell while ensuring data consistency and adhering to functional programming principles?\n\nA) Use a State monad to encapsulate the user account, allowing for mutable operations within the monad while maintaining functional purity outside it.\n\nB) Create a new immutable user account record for each modification, using lazy evaluation to optimize performance, and implement a version control system to track the latest valid state.\n\nC) Utilize Haskell's IO monad to directly interact with the database for each operation, treating the database as the single source of truth for the current state.\n\nD) Implement a custom monad that combines database operations with local caching, using phantom types to ensure type-safe state transitions between database reads and writes.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires integrating multiple concepts from functional programming and applying them to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, A, best represents the Haskell approach to modeling mutable state.\n\nThe State monad is the most appropriate tool for this task because:\n\n1. It encapsulates the concept of mutable state within a purely functional context, allowing for operations that appear to modify state while actually creating new immutable versions under the hood.\n\n2. It provides a clean and idiomatic way to chain multiple state-modifying operations, which aligns with the requirement to perform different modifications on the user account.\n\n3. It maintains referential transparency, ensuring that at any given point, there's only one valid representation of the state, addressing the concern about having multiple accessible snapshots.\n\nOption B, while partially correct in its use of immutable records and lazy evaluation, introduces unnecessary complexity with version control and doesn't leverage Haskell's built-in tools for managing state.\n\nOption C oversimplifies the problem by relying too heavily on database interactions, which would be inefficient and doesn't take advantage of Haskell's ability to model state changes in memory.\n\nOption D introduces an overly complex solution with custom monads and phantom types, which, while powerful, are not typically necessary for this kind of problem and would likely lead to overengineering.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of functional programming concepts, their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems, and their knowledge of Haskell's specific tools for managing state in a functional paradigm."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/29", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/42445", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/13400/"], "docs_id": 42445, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am considering adding full\\-length pull\\-out shelves in some of my kitchen cabinets, and this will require cutting out the center stile.

You will need a slug of lead, a ladle, yarning iron, packing iron, caulking irons, oakum, and torch. The process goes like this:\n\n* Safety first! Wear thick leather gloves and avoid eating lead particles.\n* Clean the old lead out\n* Using a yarning iron, pack the oakum around the pipe. Repeat this operation until the hub is packed to about 1\u201d from its top. Pack the oakum with a hammer and packing iron to make a bed for the molten lead.\n* Using the plumber\u2019s ladle, carefully pour the molten lead into the joint, as shown in Figure 30\\. Dip enough lead to fill the joint in one pouring. Allow a minute or two for the molten lead to harden and change incolor from royal blue to a dull grey. Usually, one pound of lead is melted for each inch of pipe size.\n* Caulk the joint first using the outside caulking iron and then the inside caulk ing iron. The first four blows should be struck 90 degrees apart around the joint to set the pipe. Drive the lead down on the oakum and into contact with the spigot surface on one edge and the inner surface of the hub on the other. Use firm but light hammer blows.\n\nThe process isn't really hard at all for vertical pipe, but does require some specialized tools.

The script executes incorrectly, and the developer receives the error message \"The process did not execute because the precondition is false.\" Which of the following is the most likely cause of this issue and the best solution?\n\nA) The script is missing error handling for database locks.

Remove the precondition to allow the function to execute at the appropriate time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue is likely the omission of the ObjectID (or equivalent row identifier) field in the InsertCursor's field list. As explained in the top answer, when using InsertCursors, it's crucial to include the ObjectID (or FID, OBJECTID, etc.) as the first field in the list, even though it's automatically generated by the system.

That should be var1\\.1 on y.\n\nAnd again, which should I rely on? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since @mattbarstead answered question two so competently, I thought I should answer question one.\n\nYour question is \"should I trust my Bayesian or my Frequentist model\" and the answer is \"no.\" You should only do one or the other, but never both. This isn't because they could differ and there would be no objective way to solve your problem, but because they are not answering the same question in the first place.\n\nA couple of qualifications about the two methods should be noted. Frequentist methods are *ex ante* optimal. That is to say, prior to picking up your data, there is no better way to analyze your data. This optimality is understood that if you were to cover the sample space that, on average, the solution meets some set of optimality criteria, such as unbiasedness, consistency and so forth. Bayesian methods are *ex post* optimal. That is they only become optimal models after they have seen the data and the solutions are specifically unique to the sample seen. There is no way to extract more information about the location of a parameter than a Bayesian method. That said, the specific Bayesian result from one sample could be a poor solution when seen over the whole sample space, but the averaging rules of Frequentist methods mean using a Frequentist method could be a poor method for the sample that happened to be seen in the study.\n\nThe second is the nature of hypotheses. Frequentist hypothesis must be binary. The null here is the \"no effect\" hypothesis, that is in a broader form $\\\\mu\\=k\\=0$. This is treated as intrinsically true before it sees the data. The data may reject this, but it is assumed true. Bayesian hypotheses are combinatoric. There is nothing similar to the hypothesis that $\\\\mu\\=k$ because if your solution is in the real numbers then $\\\\Pr(\\\\mu\\=k)\\\\equiv{0}$. Just because zero is in the Bayesian credible interval does not mean that $\\\\mu\\=k.$ It is just one of an infinite number of possible solutions.\n\nYou should be choosing a Frequentist method because you have an existential or true/false style question that needs to be answered. This is especially true if you want to use the \"no effect\" hypothesis. There is no real Bayesian equivalent to the \"no effect\" hypothesis.\n\nYou should choose the Bayesian method when you have multiple competing models of the world. The Frequentist methodology has to jump to the Bayesian in order to do model selection through tools like the AIC or BIC, which are really stylized and constrained Bayesian summary statistics. For any one Frequentist method, an infinite number of Bayesian models exists. A t\\-test covers an unbelievably wide set of possible solutions that are different and distinct when constructed as a Bayesian problem. The t\\-test just depends upon how the sample was collected, whereas the Bayesian posterior depends upon how the likelihood is constructed. This implies that the Bayesian depends upon how you model the laws of the universe. It is built on modeling. The Frequentist is an algorithm based on the sampling rules.\n\nThe second case for using Bayesian methods is when real prior knowledge exists, such as prior research where there is at least partial information on the parameters. If real prior knowledge exists then Frequentist methods are statistically inadmissible. The Bayesian solution will always stochastically dominate the Frequentist in that case.\n\nYou need to think through the question of \"what do I need to know?\" Do you need to know if these variables really do not impact the dependent variable? Do you need to discover which of many possible models of the world is the closest to the model nature uses to generate the data? The former is Frequentist, the later, Bayesian. The former permits you to make deductive statements, the latter is not considering the models you did not test and so is an incomplete form of reasoning. Because there could be models you did not think of, the Bayesian posterior is incomplete. All possible models, except the alternative hypothesis, exist in the null by its very construction.\n\nYour construction of the Bayesian model looks like a Frequentist construction. Have you considered all possible ways to combine the variables, including dropping variables?"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Bayesian and Frequentist approaches in statistical analysis, here's a challenging question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing data from a study comparing the effectiveness of three different teaching methods across five countries.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that one should not rely on both Bayesian and Frequentist methods simultaneously, as they answer different questions and have different underlying philosophies.\n\n2. The choice between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches should be based on the specific research question and the nature of the information available:\n\n   - Frequentist methods are appropriate for binary hypotheses, especially when testing a \"no effect\" hypothesis. They are ex ante optimal, meaning they are designed to perform well across the entire sample space.\n   \n   - Bayesian methods are suitable when comparing multiple competing models or when real prior knowledge exists. They are ex post optimal, providing the best possible inference for the specific data observed.\n\n3. The small sample size (5 countries) is a consideration but not the sole determining factor. While it may impact the precision of estimates, it doesn't inherently favor one approach over the other.\n\n4. If the researcher has strong prior knowledge from previous studies, a Bayesian approach might be more appropriate as it can incorporate this information.\n\n5. If the research question is focused on testing a specific null hypothesis (e.g., \"there is no difference between teaching methods\"), a Frequentist approach might be more suitable.\n\nThis question challenges the test-taker to move beyond simply choosing a method based on sample size or convenience, and instead consider the philosophical and practical differences between the two approaches in the context of the specific research scenario."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/08/05", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/79618", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/20818/"], "docs_id": 79618, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've set up my diabolical traps.

One may give an explicit map $i: G \\\\to \\\\Omega BG$ which is a weak homotopy equivalence, by comparison of long exact homotopy sequences. Since $G$ and $\\\\Omega BG$ have the homotopy types of CW complexes, the map $i$ is in fact a homotopy equivalence. \n\nI am interested in whether an explicit homotopy inverse $h: \\\\Omega BG \\\\to G$ to $i$ can be given by taking [holonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy#Holonomy_of_a_connection_in_a_principal_bundle) of loops with respect to some suitably chosen connection on the universal bundle. Naturally the \"manifold\" $BG$ is infinite\\-dimensional, but I'm thinking it would suffice to work with the finite\\-dimensional $G$\\-bundles $V\\_m \\\\to G\\_m$ (Stiefel to Grassmann) which approximate to the direct limits above, provided that the connections on each of the approximating bundles are compatible with respect to inclusion into the next, \"compatible\" here having an obvious sense in terms of $G$\\-valued holonomy. \n\nHas anyone seen this idea worked out? Naturally I'm curious also about whether a similar idea works out for a general compact Lie group $G$. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, certainly. The model for BG as you described it has a canonical, universal connection\nfor its $SO(n)$ bundle: just the induced Riemannian connection from Euclidean space.\n\nAs you\nmove an $n$\\-dimensional plane in $\\\\mathbb E^{n\\+m}$, the induced connection\nis the limit of compositions\n of orthogonal projections between nearby planes. In the limit, these become isometries.\nIt doesn't matter what is the dimension of the ambient space, as long as the projection is\ndefined. So, a loop in the Grassmanian gives an element of $G$. One example: if you\nhold a bicycle wheel by its axle, and move it around in a loop, when it comes back, it has\nrotated by some angle. That's the map.\n\nIt's a homotopy inverse of the map going the other way, namely, the classifying map for\nthe bundle obtained by the suspension of an element of $G$. The suspension of a homomorphism\nhas a canonical connection; its holonomy is $G$, so one composition of these two maps\nequals the identity. The other composition is homotopic to the identity, basically\nbecause the space of connections is contractible, and the bundle $EG$ over this model\nof $BG$ has a universal connection: Every connection on every $SO(n)$ bundle over \na $CW$ complex $X$ is induced from a map $X \\\\rightarrow BG$ (and this is also true\nin a relative form). This is a standard fact;\n I don't have a handy reference, but the proof is \"soft\". \n\nHowever, to get a more immediate classifying space for connections that works\nfor all Lie groups, just make\na simplicial complex whose simplices are connections for a $G\\-bundles$ over the simplex.\nThe $G$\\-bundle is specified by in terms of a trivialization associated with each vertex;\nthe data needed is the chart\\-transition cocyle. In addition, give a connection;\nthis amounts to specifying a connection form. Glue these simplices with $G$\\-bundles\nand connections together, to make a model for $BG$. Since the space of connections\nis contractible, this has the same homotopy type as the more usual model for $BG$ where just\nthe cocycle is specified.\n\nThe same construction works to give an explicit homotopy inverse\nin a much more general context, e.g. the group of diffeomorphisms for a manifold."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about classifying spaces and connections in Lie groups, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the relationship between the compact Lie group SO(n) and its classifying space BG.

It indicates that adverbs describing the manner or intensity of rain (e.g., \"heavily,\" \"violently,\" \"steadily\") typically follow the verb. For example, \"It rained heavily\" is more common than \"It heavily rained.\" \n\nHowever, the passage also notes that short adverbs referring to frequency (e.g., \"seldom,\" \"rarely\") are more commonly used before the verb, as in \"It seldom rains.\" This pattern isn't absolute, as shown by the example of \"rains frequently\" being more common than \"frequently rains.\"\n\nThe answer also acknowledges exceptions, such as when \"rain\" is used transitively with a direct object (e.g., \"heavily raining down insults\"), where the adverb precedes the verb phrase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes and contradicts the documented usage patterns.

It seems that it's universally assumed that this force points in the radial direction, like it would if the rod was replaced by a string \\- though of course the force from the rod can point outwards as well as inwards, while a string can only pull and not push.\n\nWhy is this? A rod is rigid, so it can transmit shear stress, so in principle the force from the rod could have a tangential component too. This is easily illustrated by considering a situation where the rod is attached to a motor which makes the system turn with a constant angular velocity $\\\\omega$. We are forced to introduce a tangential component $F\\_\\\\theta$ into the equations\n\n$$\\\\begin{gather}\nmg \\\\cos\\\\theta \\- F\\_r \\= \\-mL \\\\omega^2 \\\\\\\\\n\\-mg \\\\sin\\\\theta \\+ F\\_\\\\theta \\= 0\n\\\\end{gather}$$\n\nbecause something has to balance the tangential component of the weight.

Now let's take a cross sectional area $A$. Forces as stated are applied over this whole area. We know pressure is force applied per unit area. So by definition it would be $P\\=\\\\frac{F}{A}$. But here the forces which are acting on the cross sectional area are all same. I mean the same magnitude of forces are being applied on the area. So even if we take a unit area,that same force $F$ is being applied there,but by definition of pressure the force applied on a unit area should be $\\\\frac{F}{A}$ whereas wherever we look at(no matter how large the area is),the same force $F$ is being applied. This is really contradictory(i know i am surely being wrong but i need to know where).\n\nOr are the forces $F$ all added?I mean for example let's suppose $10$ vectors $F$ are being applied on area $A$. In that case for a unit area,obviously the number of vectors will be less than $10$,let's say $5$ (even though the magnitude is still same). Then will we take total force on $A$ as $10\\\\times F$ and the unit area as $5\\\\times F$? I am really confused.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In your diagram, there are four distinct, for want of a better term, \"pressure points\", one for each of the four applied forces. If each of the forces were actually acting at a point, the pressure exerted by each force would be infinite because a \"point\" has zero area.\n\nIn reality, all forces act on some finite area, even if small. For pressure due to physical contact forces, you need to divide the force by the area over which the contact force is acting. For example, if a book is placed on a table it exerts a pressure at the surface of the table equal to its weight divided by the area of contact with the table, not the total area of the table.\n\nOn the other hand, if we are interested in the mechanical stresses and deformation within a deformable material under the area A due to the four forces, they will be distributed in some fashion throughout the material below the surface, due to the lateral stresses produced by the local forces, being a maximum directly below the application areas, dropping to a minimum between the application areas.\n\n> could you verify if what jensen paull in his last comment about 4\n> was right in reply to my post? Also as you mentioned,since force can't\n> act on a point, could you please illustrate with a picture where a\n> single force is being on an area?That would clear my doubts.\n\nI agree with @jensen paull that if the total force applied to the area A is $Mg$ then the force applied at each of the four \"locations\" is $Mg/4$, provided that the total force is evenly distributed to the four locations.\n\nI can't say if that answered your post because, with statements like, \"let's suppose 10 vectors are being applied on area $A$\", it appears you continue to confuse the depiction of forces by vectors, which are simply geometric objects, with the actual forces themselves. I believe that, in turn, has you confused about the pressures associated with forces.\n\nBut you have asked me to illustrate the concepts with a picture, so I will. Your diagram shows four vectors which I assume are intended to depict four forces that are applied to four locations within the area $A$. A physical example are the forces that the four legs of the table in the figure below, with a book on top, would exert on the floor below. The figure shows the forces the book applies to the table, and the book plus table applies to the floor, as well as the reaction $R$ forces of the table and floor.\n\nIf the four legs are symmetrically located around the center of mass of the book, $m$ plus the mass of the table $M$ (which includes the legs), the magnitude of the force $F\\_{B\\+T}$ exerted by each leg would be\n\n$$F\\_{B\\+T}\\=\\\\frac{(m\\+M)g}{4}$$\n\nNow, the magnitude of the pressure that each leg exerts on the floor is equal to the force exerted by each leg divided by the *surface area of contact* between the leg and the floor, which would be the cross sectional area $a\\_{L}$ of a leg with a flat bottom, or\n\n$$P\\_{B\\+T}\\=\\\\frac{(m\\+M)g}{4a\\_{L}}$$\n\nI have emphasized \"surface area of contact\" because in your diagram that is only the part of A that is in contact with the legs, not the entire floor area A. You can think of the surface area of contact as the \"footprint\" of the legs on the floor.\n\nNow let's turn our attention to the book on top of the table. It exerts a pressure on the table\n\n$$P\\=\\\\frac{mg}{a\\_{B}}$$\n\nWhere $a\\_{B}$ is the area of contact between the book and the table, not the total surface area of the table.\n\nFor both the book and the table leg the force that is applied is in actuality distributed over the surface area of contact.\n\nFor example, let the density ($N/m^3$) of the book be $\\\\rho$. An infinitesimal volume of the book of $dV\\=(dl)(dw)(dh)$ where $dl,dw,dh$ are infinitesimal amounts of length, width, and height of the book, will exert a infinitesimal amount of force on the table of\n\n$$dF\\_{B}\\=g\\\\rho dV$$\n\nTo get the total force exerted by the book on the table we integrate (sum up) all the infinitesimal forces\n\n$$F\\_{B}\\=\\\\int\\_V dF\\_{B}\\=\\\\int\\_V g\\\\rho dV$$\n\nif the density of the book is uniform (constant) over its volume we have\n\n$$F\\_{B}\\=\\\\rho g \\\\int\\_V dV\\=\\\\rho V g\\=mg$$\n\nThe same would apply to each leg, with the total mass being $m\\+M$.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2R7GK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2R7GK.jpg)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about forces and pressure, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a square table with a mass of 40 kg and a top surface area of 1 m\u00b2. The table will have four identical legs, each with a contact area of 5 cm\u00b2 with the floor. A 20 kg book is placed at the center of the table. What is the difference in pressure exerted on the floor by a single table leg compared to the pressure exerted by the book on the table top?\n\nA) The pressure from a single leg is 58,800 Pa higher than the book's pressure\nB) The pressure from a single leg is 235,200 Pa higher than the book's pressure\nC) The pressure from a single leg is 137,200 Pa lower than the book's pressure\nD) The pressure from a single leg is 294,000 Pa higher than the book's pressure\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts and application of the pressure formula in different contexts. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Total mass on the floor = Table (40 kg) + Book (20 kg) = 60 kg\n2. Force on the floor = 60 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 588 N\n3. Force per table leg = 588 N / 4 = 147 N\n4. Pressure from one leg = Force / Area = 147 N / (5 * 10\u207b\u2074 m\u00b2) = 294,000 Pa\n\nFor the book on the table:\n5. Force of the book = 20 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 196 N\n6. Pressure from book = 196 N / 1 m\u00b2 = 196 Pa\n\nThe difference in pressure = 294,000 Pa - 196 Pa = 293,804 Pa\n\nThe closest answer is 235,200 Pa, which is option B. This question tests the understanding that pressure depends not just on force, but critically on the area over which that force is applied. It also requires careful attention to units and the ability to perform multi-step calculations."}, "68": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/28", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/38883", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/5559/"], "docs_id": 38883, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to setup a Minecraft server so I can play with fluffy dragons.\n\nAs the server admin how can I spawn mobs in SMP?

The \"Place order\" button becomes non-functional only when Stripe is selected as the payment method. Given this scenario, what is the most likely root cause and appropriate solution?\n\nA) JavaScript conflict between Stripe and One Step Checkout - implement a custom event listener to resolve the conflict\nB) Incompatible API versions - update the Stripe module to the latest version compatible with Magento 2.3.5\nC) Cron job misconfiguration - set up and run Magento cron jobs to process pending operations\nD) Incorrect Stripe API keys - verify and update the Stripe configuration in the Magento admin panel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue described points to a complex interaction between the Stripe payment module, Amasty's One Step Checkout, and Magento's core functionality. The key insight comes from the top answer, which suggests setting up cron jobs. In Magento, many background processes, including payment-related operations, rely on properly configured cron jobs. The fact that the issue occurs only with Stripe and One Step Checkout combined suggests that there might be pending operations or data that need to be processed in the background.\n\nOption A is plausible but less likely, as it doesn't explain why other payment methods work fine.\nOption B is incorrect because the question states that the latest version (2.1.4) of the Stripe module is being used.\nOption D is unlikely because Stripe works correctly when One Step Checkout is disabled.\n\nSetting up and running Magento cron jobs (Option C) is the most appropriate solution. Cron jobs in Magento handle various scheduled tasks, including processing pending payment operations, updating order statuses, and synchronizing data between modules. By ensuring that cron jobs are properly configured and running, it's likely to resolve the interaction issues between Stripe and One Step Checkout, allowing the \"Place order\" button to function correctly.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Magento architecture, payment processing, third-party modules, and system configuration) and tests the ability to analyze a real-world e-commerce issue beyond simple memorization of facts."}, "71": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/07/01", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/573711", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/207570/"], "docs_id": 573711, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm currently looking for some advice about making my circuit as low power consumption as much as possible.\n\nI need to use three DIP switches in order to set the address of my ATmega328P board in a [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) custom network.\n\nI've seen that one of the most used solution is to wire up the external pull\\-up resistors to VCC, as reported below:\n\n[![Pull-up switches](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwfoF.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwfoF.png)\n\n...but, this approach is extremely inefficient for my purposes (my hardware, during deep\\-sleep needs to reach 1\\-5\u00a0\u00b5A of current draw).\n\nSo, my intention is to remove the external pull\\-up resistors and use the internal pull\\-up resistors of the digital input of the ATmega328P.\n\nThis approach will allow me to enable the internal pull\\-up resistors **only** when I need to read the switches status (during boot for a very limited time).\n\nSo, theoretically, this will be very efficient and low power.\n\nThis will be the resulting schematic (taken from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalInputPullup)):\n\n[![Internal pull-up resistors](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKwyR.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKwyR.png)\n\nThis is my idea to solve this issue. Anyway, I've not tested yet. I would be glad if someone will share their thoughts about that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't recommend turning off the pull\\-up. This has two problems:\n\n* Input pin is vulnerable to noise pickup\n* The pin can float to a mid\\-state, causing increased input buffer power\n\nIf you can spare one more pin, connect the switch commons to that pin instead of GND, and drive that common low only when reading the switches. Then during the non\\-reading time the pins are always tied by either the pull\\-up (switch open) or to the driven\\-high common (switch closed), yet don't have any standby draw. Like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/joEO9m.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fjoEO9m.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nEven then, the internal pull\\-up (30K or more) is kind of weak, especially if this is to be deployed in a harsh environment. Adding some capacitance to the pin (30pF or so) will bypass noise from the pin and improve its immunity. You can also switch the pins to output mode during the non\\-reading time for the best possible noise immunity.\n\nBut why DIP switches at all? Maybe do away with them altogether and store this state in EEPROM along with your other device configuration info.\n\nBut... why bother with even that? Take advantage of the fact that it's a wirelessly\\-connected device with a unique ID. Idea: use the LoRa device unique identifer (DevEUI) and assign its physical position at the application level as you install it. If the nodes are widely spaced, use a geolocation coordinate; if they're part of a tight array, use some gridding location in the plant or on the equipment.\n\nMore about LoRa addressing here: <https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/addressing/>\n\nFinally, a bit of unsolicited advice. As a hardware person it\u2019s easy to fall into the direct, seemingly obvious solution, as DIP switches, jumpers and the like often are. I encourage you to think outside the hardware box and push for a software solution instead. The PC industry struggled for years with jumpers and switches until someone finally said \u2018enough\u2019 and Plug\u2019n\u2019Play and its descendants (PCMCIA, Cardbus and PCIe CIS) came into being.\n\ntl; dr: Jumpers are evil.

D1/D2 will switch on, only if something goes wrong. D1 and D2 are normal silicon diodes, which you should select for low leakage current.\n\nThe schematic editor used 1N4148 but according to datasheet, leakage is quite high. You could try [1N3595](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/308/1N3595-1118202.pdf) which has much lower leakage.

Here's why:\n\n1. Voltage Divider Limitation: The voltage divider reduces the voltage to a safe level, but doesn't address the issue of measuring extremely low currents.\n\n2. Darlington Pair (Option A): While Darlington pairs can amplify current, they're not ideal for such low currents due to their base-emitter voltage drops and potential leakage currents.\n\n3. Direct ADC Connection (Option C): This wouldn't work because the Arduino's ADC isn't sensitive enough to measure such low currents directly.\n\n4. Current Mirror (Option D): While this could potentially work, it's more complex and less precise than a transimpedance amplifier for this application.\n\n5. Transimpedance Amplifier (Correct Answer B): This configuration is ideal because:\n   - It converts the tiny current to a measurable voltage\n   - It provides very high input impedance, not loading the source\n   - It can be designed with very low input bias current, crucial for measuring nanoamps\n   - It offers adjustable gain through feedback resistor selection\n   - It maintains the virtual ground at the input, preserving measurement accuracy\n\nAdditionally, this solution aligns with Olin Lathrop's suggested approach in the top answer, which uses an op-amp to measure the current across a sense resistor.

The correct answer, D, addresses both the boot issue and the invisibility of the SATA drive:\n\n1.

The scenario in option C directly contradicts this concept by presenting code that is difficult to follow mentally. Long methods with nested conditionals increase complexity, making it harder to track the code's flow. Frequently changing variable values (mutable state) further complicate mental execution, as one needs to keep track of multiple changing states simultaneously. This type of code typically requires external tools or pen-and-paper to understand, which goes against the principle of being \"easy to reason about.\"\n\nOptions A and B present characteristics that actually make code easier to reason about: short functions, descriptive names, minimal mutations, pure functions, and immutable data structures all contribute to code that's easier to understand and mentally execute.

Let me first answer your question, and then explain why I have issues with the other answer.\n\nSuppose you have a Hamiltonian of the form $H \\= H\\_1 \\+ H\\_2$, where $\\[H\\_1, H\\_2] \\= 0$. Then, since $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. That is, there exists an eigenbasis of the form $\\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$ where $H\\_1 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_1 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$ and $H\\_2 \\| \\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle \\= \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\|\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle$. An arbitrary state in your Hilbert space can be written in the form\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\= \\\\sum\\_{\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2} c\\_{\\\\varepsilon\\_1,\\\\varepsilon\\_2} \\|\\\\varepsilon\\_1, \\\\varepsilon\\_2 \\\\rangle ,\n$$\nbut if your goal is only to find energy eigenstates, you are allowed to assume that you are working in a common eigenstate of $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ separately. This is the complete answer to your question. Note that if $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ didn't commute, then there would not exist a common eigenbasis, and it would not be possible to factorize your wavefunction.\n\nNow, here is the problem with the other answer: *there is no reason to assume that $H\\_1$ and $H\\_2$ have tensor product structure*. Separation of variables works even when the Hamiltonian is NOT of the form $H \\= H\\_1 \\\\otimes 1 \\+ 1 \\\\otimes H\\_2$. The difference is that when $H$ has this tensor product structure, the eigenvalues $\\\\varepsilon\\_1$ and $\\\\varepsilon\\_2$ can be chosen independently, but this doesn't have to be the case; indeed, *this is not the case for the hydrogen atom!!* In the hydrogen atom, the allowed quantum numbers $(n,\\\\ell,m)$ cannot all be chosen independently, for example $\\\\ell$ is not allowed to exceed $n$. This is indicative of the fact that, while the Hamiltonian splits into two commuting pieces, it does not have the tensor product structure indicated by the other answer."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A quantum physicist is studying a complex system that can be described by a Hamiltonian H = H1 + H2 + H3. They want to use the separation of variables method to find the energy eigenstates. Which of the following conditions is most crucial for this approach to be valid?\n\nA) H1, H2, and H3 must have tensor product structure\nB) The total wavefunction must be normalizable\nC) H1, H2, and H3 must all mutually commute\nD) The system must be in a pure quantum state\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key condition for using the separation of variables method in quantum mechanics is that the individual components of the Hamiltonian must commute with each other. In this case, H1, H2, and H3 must all mutually commute ([H1, H2] = [H1, H3] = [H2, H3] = 0). \n\nThis condition is crucial because when the Hamiltonian components commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. This means there exists a common eigenbasis for all components, allowing the total wavefunction to be expressed as a product of individual eigenfunctions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because tensor product structure is not necessary for separation of variables, as explicitly stated in the documentation. The hydrogen atom example demonstrates that separation can occur without this structure.\n\nOption B, while important for physical interpretations, is not the critical factor for the separation of variables method to be applicable.\n\nOption D is not directly relevant to the separation of variables technique.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the conditions for separability, the nature of commuting operators, and the distinction between commuting Hamiltonians and tensor product structure.

You wrote\n\n> Soon we find that some old project takes long time in running the migration file\n\nBut why do you have to run the migrations more than once? Once the migrations are done to a specific intermediate version of the db schema of your dev database, make a full database dump and put that dump under source control as well.

I line the photos up in software and switch between the top and bottom pictures. Then draw the traces over it in a program that allows stacking of images and vector graphics (power point, visio). \n\nIf the program has layers, then traces can be created for both top and bottom layers. I then identify each component, either by visual inspection or by unsoldering and using a digital multi meter to find the functionality. \n It's also nice because it allows one to label all of the components. This would be difficult to do on a four layer board at which point, instead of taking pictures, an x\\-ray machine would need to be used. \n\nThe picture below shows this done for the top layer of a board, which all of the traces on the top layer have been traced out. If I couldn't see a trace, I used a microscope to find out where it went and sometimes a continuity check.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcZ3M.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcZ3M.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about reverse engineering circuit diagrams, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is tasked with reverse engineering an unknown SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply) circuit board without access to its original schematic.

It preserves the integrity of the circuit by minimizing physical interference with components.\n2. It allows for visual inspection of both sides of the board, which is crucial for understanding the layout.\n3.

All the changes you define in the array are the actual changes being made to the product attributes. So in this case the product\\-website relation will be adjusted. The 'websites' parameter does not mean the other attributes are only updated for the given websites.\n\nThe only way to adjust data on a specific level can be done by passing in an additional parameter for the storeview. Like below, in this case the '2' as the last parameter stands for the storeview with ID 2\\.\n\n```\n$result = $client->call($session, 'catalog_product.update', array('33', array(\n    'short_description' => 'Product short description 2',\n    'meta_description' => 'Product meta description 2',\n    'price' => '100',\n), '2'));\n\n```\n\nUnfortunately though price is a website level attribute. I hoped that it would automatically echo the defined price attribute value to the website level, but instead the values is updated directly on the global level.\n\nSo in short, it does not look like you can adjust prices on a website level via the API. You will need to create a custom API for it. Either that, or I'm accidentally overlooking something in the Core API documentation.\n<http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/catalog/catalogProduct/catalog_product.update.html>\n\nBy the looks of it there is a different API call for the setting special prices.

Add this to your options object for the wms layer: resolutions: [1.40625,0.703125,0.3515625,0.17578125,0.087890625,0.0439453125]\"\n\nThe other options represent plausible but incorrect solutions:\nA) While projection issues can cause rendering problems, the error message doesn't indicate a projection mismatch, and both layers are already defined in EPSG:4326.\nC) The BBOX strategy for WFS is not directly related to the WMS layer issue, and changing it wouldn't resolve the resolutions error.\nD) The featureNS is specific to the WFS layer and wouldn't affect the WMS layer's functionality or resolve the resolutions error.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (WMS, WFS, OpenLayers configuration) and tests the ability to analyze an error message in the context of a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/12", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/474438", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/153274/"], "docs_id": 474438, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to draw the diagram shown below : \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/beIOe.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/beIOe.png)\n\nI tried with this code (taken from [http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/noise\\-shaper/](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/noise-shaper/))\n\n```\n\\documentclass[tikz,14pt,border=10pt]{standalone}\n\\usepackage{textcomp}\n\\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows}\n\\begin{document}\n% Definition of blocks:\n\\tikzset{%\n  block/.style    = {draw, thick, rectangle, minimum height = 3em,\n    minimum width = 3em},\n  sum/.style      = {draw, circle, node distance = 2cm}, % Adder\n  input/.style    = {coordinate}, % Input\n  output/.style   = {coordinate} % Output\n}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, thick, node distance=10cm, >=triangle 45]\n                \\draw\n                node at (0,0)[right=-3mm]{\\Large \\textopenbullet}\n                node [input, name=input1] {} \n                node at (2,0)[block] (h1) {\\Large $h_1(t)$}\n                node at (2.5,0) (s1) {}\n                node at (3.5,0)[block,right of=s1] (h2) {\\Large $h_2(t)$}\n                node at (5.5,0) (s2) {}\n                node at (6.5,0) (s3) {};\n                \\draw[->](input1) -- node {$x(t)$}(h1);\n                \\draw[->](s1) -- node {$x(t)*h_1(t)$}(h2);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThis, sadly, do not produce the desired diagram.\n\nI have this \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvTYC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvTYC.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\n\\documentclass[tikz,14pt,border=10pt]{standalone}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta, positioning}\n\\usepackage{textcomp}\n\n\\begin{document}\n% Definition of blocks:\n\\tikzset{%\n  block/.style  = {rectangle, draw, thick, minimum height = 3em, minimum width = 3em,\n                   font=\\large},\n%  sum/.style    = {draw, circle, node distance = 2cm}, % Adder\n%  input/.style  = {coordinate}, % Input\n%  output/.style = {coordinate} % Output\n}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 4mm]\n\\coordinate[label=left:$x(t)$] (in);\n\\draw[{Circle[open,length=2mm]}-Triangle]\n                    (in) -- ++ (1,0) node[block,right] (h1) {$h_1(t)$};\n\\draw[-Triangle]    (h1.east) -- ++ (1,0) node[right] (h2) {$x(t)*h_1(t)$};\n\\draw[-Triangle]    (h2.east) -- ++ (1,0) node[block,right] (h3) {$h_2(t)$};\n\\draw[-Triangle]    (h3.east) -- ++ (1,0) node[right] (h4){$y(t) = [x(t)*h_1(t)*h_2(t)$};\n%\n\\node[block, below=of h3] (h5) {$h_1(t)*h_2(t)$};\n\\draw[Triangle-]    (h5.west) -- ++ (-1,0) node[left]  {$x(t)$};\n\\draw[-Triangle]    (h5.east) -- ++ ( 1,0) node[right] {$y(t)$};\n\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nSHm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nSHm.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about creating a diagram using TikZ in LaTeX, I'll generate a question that requires analysis and application of the concepts:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is trying to modify the given TikZ code to add a feedback loop from the output of h2(t) back to the input of h1(t). Which combination of TikZ commands and styles would be most appropriate to achieve this while maintaining the diagram's current structure and aesthetics?\n\nA) Add a \\draw[-Triangle] command from (h3.south) to (in.south), and define a new bend right style\nB) Use the \\path command with the to operation, adding controls to create a curved path from (h4) to (in)\nC) Implement a new coordinate below the diagram and use multiple \\draw commands to create a rectangular path\nD) Add a \\node[circle] below h2(t) and connect it to both (h2.south) and (in) using \\draw[-Triangle] commands\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate solution is option B, which suggests using the \\path command with the to operation and adding controls for a curved path. This approach is ideal for several reasons:\n\n1. Flexibility: The \\path command with the to operation allows for precise control over the path's shape and direction, which is crucial for creating a clean feedback loop without interfering with existing elements.\n\n2. Consistency with existing code: The given code already uses similar drawing commands, so this approach maintains consistency in style and structure.\n\n3. Aesthetics: By using controls to create a curved path, the feedback loop can be drawn smoothly around existing elements, enhancing the diagram's visual appeal.\n\n4. Efficiency: This method requires minimal additional code and doesn't necessitate creating new nodes or significantly altering the existing structure.\n\n5. Scalability: If the diagram needs to be modified further, this approach allows for easy adjustments to the feedback loop's path.\n\nOption A is less suitable as it doesn't provide enough control over the path's shape and might intersect with existing elements. Option C is overly complicated and doesn't maintain the diagram's current aesthetic. Option D introduces unnecessary additional nodes and doesn't offer the smooth curvature needed for an elegant feedback loop.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the existing code, understand TikZ syntax and capabilities, and apply that knowledge to solve a real-world diagramming problem while considering both functionality and aesthetics."}}
