The statement accurately reflects the information provided in the StackExchange answer. Most spacetimes would indeed lack isometries (symmetries of the metric), but these are rarely studied due to their mathematical complexity. This is why physicists often make symmetry assumptions to simplify problems.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage indicates that spacetimes without symmetries are possible and even common, though difficult to work with mathematically.\n\nAnswer B is false because, while such spacetimes are difficult to solve, they can be mathematically described (the passage mentions examples like systems with multiple matter sources not in a plane).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect on two counts.

The variance of Y1 is \u03c3\u00b2, and the variance of Y2 is n\u03c3\u00b2. Therefore, the weights should be:\n\nw1 = 1/\u03c3\u00b2 and w2 = 1/(n\u03c3\u00b2)\n\nNormalizing these weights, we get:\nw1 = n/(n+1) and w2 = 1/(n+1)\n\nApplying these weights to Y1 and Y2 gives us:\n\u03b2\u03020 = (n/(n+1))Y1 + (1/(n+1))Y2 = (nY1 + Y2) / (n + 1)\n\nThis is the formula given in option D, making it the correct answer that provides the BLUE for \u03b20 in this heteroscedastic scenario."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/27", "source": ["https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8312", "https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/users/62390/"], "docs_id": 8312, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm almost certain I'm missing this when I'm searching meta.

However, these flags are meant to be a signal for further review, not a definitive judgment. The system flags posts to say \"Hey, something might be up here,\" but human reviewers are needed to assess whether the flagged content actually lacks quality. This approach allows for the possibility that some short answers may be sufficient and of good quality, while also catching potentially problematic posts for further examination.

The final result will end up where the specification (for instance a high\\-level language statement) specifies that it should. Take for instance\n\n```\nA = ( 3 * B ) + C\n\n```\n\nIt is clear that the final result must end up in A, because the statement says so. But most CPU's can't do this calculation without first calculating ( 3 \\* B ). So where should that value end up? That depends on the type of CPU architecture.

Do I see it as the adjective, dropping the pronoun \"one\"? \n\nI think it should be like this:\n\nthis is the closest **one (that)** I've ever gotten to a college graduation.\n\nRight?\n\nIf that's the case, should I think \"the closest\" is basically the object of a verb \"have gotten\"?\n\nThen, what is the meaning of \"get\" in here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.\n\nAlmost, but not quite. This sentence does indeed involve a relative clause. We could reconstruct the relative clause like this:\n\n* Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest **that I've ever gotten to a college graduation.**\n\nThe important thing about relative clauses is that they have a gap in them. The gap tells us where the missing element should be. So for example consider this sentence:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw yesterday].\n\nThis relative clause has a gap in it that tells you where *the man* would be in the clause:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw \\_\\_\\_ yesterday].\n\nBecause our language brain knows where the gap is we can understand the sentence like this:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw **the man** yesterday].\n\n**The relative clause**\n\nIt is not straightforward to understand exactly where the gap is here. This is because, as the Original Poster felt, we often associate relative clauses with a noun phrase antecedent. However, in this case the antecedent isn't a typical noun phrase. Here's where the gap is:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten \\_\\_\\_\\_ to a college graduation]\n\nWe understand it like this:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten **close** to a college graduation].\n\nThis sentence is unusual because it has a superlative adjective as an antecedent, not a noun or clause. The verb *gotten* her means something like *come* or *been*.\n\n**The grammatical function of *closest***\n\nThe Original Poster asks if *the closest* is the Object of the verb *GET*, in this case part of the perfect construction *have gotten*. The answer is, no. However, it has a function similar to an Object. Like an Object, it is a Complement of the verb. But it is a Predicative Complement, not an Object. Like Objects, Predicative Complements fill a special slot set up by the verb. They don't tell us *what* someone was doing something to though and they don't introduce a new entity into the sentence. Instead Predicative Complements tell us something about the Subject or Object of the sentence. \n\nIn this case, the phrase *the closest that I've ever got to a college graduation* is the Predicative Complement of the verb *is*. It describes the situation denoted by *this*. Notice that this is *NOT* an adverbial. It is not an extra part of the grammar in the sentence. It is not an extraneous addition to the meaning either. The sentence is quite simply ungrammatical without it:\n\n> \\*Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is. (ungrammatical with this meaning)\n\nThe verb *BE* cannot ever, ever take Objects, it can only take Predicative or Locative Complements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the sentence \"This is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation,\" what is the grammatical function of \"the closest\"?\n\nA) Direct object of \"have gotten\"\nB) Adverbial modifier\nC) Predicative complement of \"is\"\nD) Subject complement of \"gotten\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \"The closest\" in this sentence functions as a predicative complement of the verb \"is\". It is not a direct object, as the verb \"be\" (is) cannot take objects. It's not an adverbial modifier because it's not an extra or optional part of the sentence - the sentence would be ungrammatical without it. It's also not a subject complement of \"gotten\", as \"gotten\" is part of the relative clause and not the main verb of the sentence. As a predicative complement, \"the closest\" describes the situation denoted by \"this\" and is an essential part of the sentence structure following the verb \"is\"."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/19", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1076529", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/872993/"], "docs_id": 1076529, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been using the Brother MFC\\-J6935DW printer, for almost a year, with Ubuntu 16\\.04 over wifi.

Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate and efficient way to accomplish this?\n\nA) Use a for loop with setExtent() function:\n```r\nst_ext <- extent(-180, 180, -90, 90)\nfor (i in 1:NROW(r)){\n  r[[i]] <- setExtent(r[[i]], st_ext)\n}\n```\n\nB) Directly modify the extent properties:\n```r\nfor (i in 1:NROW(r)){\n  xmin(r[[i]]) <- -180\n  xmax(r[[i]]) <- 180\n}\n```\n\nC) Use the rotate() function:\n```r\nfor (i in 1:NROW(r)){\n  r[[i]] <- rotate(r[[i]])\n}\n```\n\nD) Create a RasterStack and modify its extent:\n```r\nstack <- stack(r)\nextent(stack) <- c(-180, 180, -90, 90)\nr <- unstack(stack)\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to use the rotate() function. When changing the extent from (0, 360, -90, 90) to (-180, 180, -90, 90), you're essentially rotating the raster around the Earth's axis. The rotate() function is specifically designed for this purpose and will correctly adjust the data values along with the extent. \n\nOption A and B (setExtent() and directly modifying extent properties) would change the extent metadata but not properly adjust the underlying data, leading to misaligned information. \n\nOption D (using a RasterStack) is unnecessarily complicated and still doesn't address the need to rotate the data.\n\nThe rotate() function ensures that both the extent and the data are correctly transformed, making it the most appropriate solution for this specific case."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/22", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/50194", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/11765/"], "docs_id": 50194, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and let $\\\\mu$ be a left Haar measure.

Note that this space has a natural structure of a $G$\\-module through left action. \n\nNow in the special case where $G$ is a compact Lie group ($G$ is not necessarily connected so in particular this covers all finite groups) then all irreducible representation\nare unitary (the average trick) and finite dimensional (this I think is non\\-trivial and follows from Peter\\-Weyl, actually I never looked at the proof of this result).

The maximum degree (with weights) is a lower bound. If you took off the the condition that the colors assigned to an edge are themselves an interval then it would be Vizing's problem in a graph with possible multiple edges so maximum degree or maximum degree plus 1\\. It might help to think of each edge getting just one color (an integer, the smallest color assigned in your scheme) and the first number $w(e)$ specifying how seperated that color has to be from any incident color. \n\nI'd start with the case that $w(e)$ is a constant $q$. Then Vizing's theorem would give that $q\\\\Delta\\+q$ colors suffice where $\\\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the underlying graph. I imagine that sometimes that number would be needed.

However, using $m$ as originally described *if you are honest about the model not applying to cases with missing x* seems to be a good idea (although not the $best$ idea, which would be to impute and have $m'$ for the whole population), and not to be kind of incorrect like (1\\) or (2\\). In this way, removing missing data does not introduce 'bias' it introduces constraints on the usability of the model?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It Depends\n----------\n\nWhether excluding cases with missing data is fine or not depends on a few factors. Whatever choice is made requires justification, so there is a bit or work to do with the data. The more ancillary information available to you, the better you can make a choice. Testing the randomness of the missing values is essential to guide your steps. This is because things become much more complex once you start to look at biased missingness. \n\nI'll use an example of an arbitrary disease that requires some blood test and a questionaire. \n\nAre values \n\nMissing Completely At Random (MCAR): no pattern at all to the missingness. This may be that one subject is missing because the person got caught in traffic and didn't have time to complete all the tests, another because they faint at the sight of needles, another because the doctor's scrawl was completely uninterpretable. The reasons are unnconnected to each other and to whether the person has the disease or not.\n\nMissing At Random (MAR). Has a relationship with what you have observed, but is not due to the underlying value. For example a questionnaire answer may be more likely to be missing in old subjects who have worse memory, but the likelihood of forgetting is not related what the answer would have been. Age may be a risk factor in the disease, so the forgetting is confounded with disease risk even through it is not caused by the disease.\n\nMissing Not At Random (MNAR) there is a pattern to which variables are missing, the likelihood of being missing is biased by the actual value of the variable. For example, males may not wish to report impotence and choose to not report it. To diagnose this often needs additional data as you don\u2019t know what the value should be. \nSee\n[https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/missing\\-data\\-mechanism/](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/missing-data-mechanism/) which explains these and provides some advice on how to deal with the different types.\n\n---\n\nPossible Solutions\n------------------\n\nThe five options I am aware off (1st 2 you have already discussed) are:\n\n1. Ignore missing data in model. When you come to predict new\nsamples that have missing data it will return and invalid result due\nto the missing value. You are right that this approach will limit\nyour ability to make generalisations about the entire population unless you can prove that the missing data is MCAR. The model will fail when missing data is present, so you are not going to produce false predictions. Failure is useful information and not to be ignored. Mechanisms to\nhandle the failure need to be appropriately designed. This will have theoretically have a neglible effect if data is truely MCAR as the missingness is unbiased. With MNAR there is definite bias in the missingness and this would be passed onto the model that ignores missingness. With MAR there is a risk that although the missingness is not due to the disease, it may be linked to factors that are confounded with disease and so may still bias your model.\n2. Impute missing data into model. As a couple of commenters have pointed out the main value of imputation is maintaining statistical robustness of the dataset. It doesn't help the individual receiving a diagnosis if you replace their true value with (for a simple case) the mean of the population. Its aim is to preserve the overall statistical properties of the dataset for the general population. Imputation works best in a multivariate\ndataset where the relationship with other variables can help improve\nthe imputation (specific patterns in variables T, U, V, W may be\nassociated with more probable values of X) as these allow tailored estmation of the individual's value. If mechanisms causing\nmissingness (MAR or MNAR) can be identified these should be used to\nguide the imputation. Validation of the model should include missing\ndata to ensure the imputation and model is handled well in independent \nsamples. As @JWH2006 points out the extent of missingness will also affect your choice of tool \\- the lower the proportion of observations the riskier imputation becomes, requiring more powerful methods.\n3. If your variable types allow it, you can recode missing data to a new\nnumeric level in X that does not otherwise arise. This implicitly\nhandles the impact of missingness and will capture an element of any\nbias that exists. This should mitigate against missingness bias in all three categories.\n4. A mashup of 2 and 3 alongside imputation you can create a Xmissing variable (e.g.\n0 observed, 1 missing) that will be given its own model coefficient\nand confidence intervals to explicitly handle the missingness. Again, this should mitigate against bias in the missingness.\n5. If\nthere is the possibility of revisiting the data source (even for a\npartial sample of the missing and complete samples) and reacquiring\nit then this may be useful to better understand the mechanism of\nmissingness to make a more robust procedure. Above I suggested some approaches can mitigate against bias, but they will never be guaranteed to eliminate its effect. If there is any way to go back and fill in the blanks it will improve your understanding of how the missingness arose and therefore give clues on how to handle it best.\n\nRemember\n--------\n\nIt also matters if the data is truly missing as opposed to something like not\\-applicable, not\\-detected or a saturation event. Not detected events are usually recoded to half the detection limit. Saturation events usually set to the saturation threshold."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A medical researcher is developing a predictive model for a rare disease using blood test results (X) and patient-reported symptoms (Y).

Though this can be done, I prefer a different approach: let us prove that exterior powers commute with pullback for morphisms of ringed spaces, which will solve the problem after being applied to the morphism $(\\\\{x\\\\},\\\\mathcal{O}\\_{X,x})\\\\to (X,\\\\mathcal{O}\\_X)$.\n\nLet $f:Y\\\\to X$ be a morphism of ringed spaces, let $\\\\mathcal{F}$ be an $\\\\mathcal{O}\\_X$\\-module, let $T^n(\\\\mathcal{F})\\=\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\otimes\\_{\\\\mathcal{O}\\_X}\\\\cdots\\\\otimes\\_{\\\\mathcal{O}\\_X}\\\\mathcal{F}$ be the $n$\\-fold tensor product, and let $\\\\mathcal{K}\\_n(\\\\mathcal{F})$ be the subsheaf of $T^n(\\\\mathcal{F})$ generated by tensors with two entries equal. Then we have an exact sequence $$0\\\\to \\\\mathcal{K}\\\\to T^n(\\\\mathcal{F})\\\\to \\\\bigwedge^n\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\to 0,$$ and we can pull it back along $f$ to get a right\\-exact sequence $$ f^\\*\\\\mathcal{K}\\\\to f^\\*T^n(\\\\mathcal{F})\\\\to f^\\*\\\\bigwedge^n\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\to 0\\.$$\nAs [tensor products commute with arbitrary pullbacks of ringed spaces](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/92421/), we have that $f^\\*T^n(\\\\mathcal{F})\\=T^n(f^\\*\\\\mathcal{F})$. If we can show that $f^\\*\\\\mathcal{K}$ surjects on to the subsheaf of $T^n(f^\\*\\\\mathcal{F})$ generated by tensors with two entries equal, we win: this gives that $f^\\*\\\\bigwedge^n\\\\mathcal{F}\\=\\\\bigwedge^nf^\\*\\\\mathcal{F}$ because they're the same quotient.\n\nBut this is rather straightforward: by expanding a local section of $T^n(f^\\*\\\\mathcal{F})$ with two coordinates equal in to a sum of pure tensors, it suffices to treat the case of $t\\=x\\\\otimes x\\\\otimes \\\\cdots$ where $x\\=\\\\sum a\\_i\\\\otimes g\\_i$ for $a\\_i$ a local section of $f^{\\-1}\\\\mathcal{F}$ and $g\\_i$ a local section of $\\\\mathcal{O}\\_Y$ and all the entries in $\\\\cdots$ are local sections of $f^{\\-1}\\\\mathcal{F}$.

The proof in the documentation constructs this isomorphism in a way that respects the OY-module structure.\n\nThe key to this result is that tensor products commute with arbitrary pullbacks of ringed spaces, and the exterior power can be expressed as a quotient of the tensor power by a certain subsheaf.

I assume it's better for when I'm going to play more passive, but beyond that, what should I look for in terms of matchups?\n\nEdit: I suppose I'm looking for more general advice, depending on the composition of the enemy team.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have a rune page with armor yellows for when I know I am running against an AD mid. With solo Q you never know what you will face.\n\nFor example yesterday I faced a Talon mid as Veigar and I ran armor yellows. I was able to out\\-trade him and get an early game advantage. ( of course I underestimated his lvl 6 burst and we ended up being pretty even throughout most of the game :) )\n\nFor rune pages in general it really does depend on the champ so I would take any answer here with a grain of salt.\n\nBut in general I think that **flat mana regen is almost always better than mana regen per level.** This is because mana regen for most AP champs is most difficult in the first 6 levels. By the time you get to the point where per level runes are better you should have blue buff and potentially have items that compensate. In the first 6 levels you want enough mana to harass and out\\-damage your opponent.\n\nThe other thing to consider is potentially going **flat magic resist blues** in order to **out\\-harass** your opponent (of course only if you are facing an AP champ). An early game CS advantage is extremely important so that magic resistance can really make a difference. And just as above with mana regen, flat is a good choice to get the upper hand in the first 6 levels.\n\n**For quints movement speed** is often the best choice on many ap\\-mid champs. This is especially true when facing an opponent with skill shots (Karthus, Morgana, Anivia, etc). More movement makes it easier to dodge those skill shots which can be the difference between winning and losing the lane. Movement speed quints will sometimes make you faster than the enemy jungler making it easier to escape ganks.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about the enemy team composition when considering runes.

In General Relativity, the concept of gravitational energy is notoriously difficult to define precisely. Unlike other forms of energy in physics, gravitational energy in GR cannot be easily localized or calculated using standard tensor methods. Instead, physicists often resort to using pseudotensors, which are not true tensors and depend on the choice of coordinate system.

There are also very abstract formulations that I am not familiar with (by e.g., Hartshorne \"Residues and Duality\", Joseph Lipman \"Residues and Traces of Differential Forms Via Hochschild Homology\", Amnon Yekutieli \"An Explicit Construction of the Grothendieck Residue Complex (with appendix by P. Sastry)\", etc.), but in down\\-to\\-earth terms the idea is: given a system of equations $F(x)\\=0$, and some other function $G$, how do you compute $\\\\sum\\_z G(z)$ where the sum is over all solutions of $F(x)\\=0$. You may or not include division by the Jacobian of the $F$'s in the function $G$. Multidimensional residues answer this question. Resultants appear as denominators of residues. Moreover, taking logarithms, and by the Poisson formula, a resultant can be computed by a residue. So the two concepts are tightly related. In good cases, taking the residue seen as a linear form on the algebra of $G$'s mod the ideal of the $F$'s, gives a nondegenerate trace, hence the \"duality\" associated with residues."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the fundamental concept that various definitions of \"residue\" in complex analysis aim to capture?\n\nA) The evaluation of a holomorphic function at isolated singularities in one complex variable\n\nB) A homomorphism between specific algebraic structures in several complex variables\n\nC) A generalization of the Cauchy integral formula to higher dimensions\n\nD) A method for computing sums of function values over solutions to systems of equations\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While all options relate to aspects of residue theory, option D most accurately captures the fundamental concept across various definitions of \"residue\" in complex analysis, especially when considering multiple complex variables.

Is there any resource for beginners to understand algorithms with graph?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you've read the [Wikipedia kNN Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)? (It has a diagram illustrating how it works in 2 dimensions.)\n\nAs a simple example, assume you're looking to classify homes by \"Well\\-maintained\" or \"Not well\\-maintained\". You have a map and you are able to stick pins on this map: green for \"Well\\-maintained\" and red for \"Not well\\-maintained\". You go online and find some recent photos of a couple dozen houses in your section of the town and as you look at each one, you place either a red or green pin in your map at the location of the house.\n\nThen your realtor friend calls you and says, \"Hey, I have a call about a house at such\\-and\\-such address and I hear you are researching how well\\-maintained houses are. Is this one likely to be well\\-maintained?\" So you find that address on your map and look at the 10 nearest pins and 8 out of 10 are green. So you tell your friend, \"It looks like there's a fairly high chance that it's well\\-maintained.\"\n\nIn this example, $k\\=10$, and the distance was the literal distance (based on lat/lon) of houses. We're making the assumption that blocks, streets, neighborhoods tend to be well\\-maintained or not, which is somewhat plausible but of course there are always exceptions.\n\nSo, to generalize a bit, you first gather a set of points that you know the classification of already. These will be your exemplars. When you have a new point that comes in and you want to classify it, you look at the $k$ exemplars that are closest to the new point and the most common classification is what you decide your new point must be. Obviously, if all $k$ nearest exemplars are from one class, you're pretty certain of your new classification. And if the $k$ nearest exemplars fall into $k$ different classes you really can't make a decision at all. Between those two extremes, you have varying levels of confidence.\n\nWith $k\\=1$, the new point is considered to be of the same class as its nearest exemplar, no voting necessary. But you're more likely to make mistakes because of the exceptions I mentioned. Larger $k$ allows more votes and in general that leads to more stable outcomes, but you also end up with more distant exemplars voting and you homogenize out local variations.\n\nIn real problems, you will not have lat/lon of houses, but a lot of facts/measurements for each data point. For a person, maybe height, weight, age, smoker/non\\-smoker, etc. The distance between people is more abstract, but you can come up with such a distance and do the same thing \\-\\- in as many dimensions as facts/measurements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the kNN algorithm explanation:\n\nQuestion: A real estate company wants to use the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to predict whether houses in a new neighborhood are likely to be well-maintained or not.

For a new house they want to classify, which of the following approaches would likely yield the most reliable prediction using kNN?\n\nA) Use k=1 and classify the new house based solely on the single most similar house in the dataset.\nB) Use k=50 and classify the new house based on the majority class among the 50 most similar houses.\nC) Use k=10 and classify the new house based on the majority class among the 10 most similar houses.\nD) Use k=100 and classify the new house based on the majority class of all houses in the dataset.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While k=1 is simple, it's too susceptible to outliers and noise in the data. It doesn't consider enough neighbors to make a robust prediction.\nB) k=50 is likely too large for a dataset of 100 houses. It would include half of all houses, potentially from very different neighborhoods, diluting the local patterns.\nC) k=10 strikes a good balance. It considers enough neighbors to smooth out individual anomalies, but not so many that it loses local context. This is typically a good starting point for kNN.\nD) Using k=100 would simply predict the majority class of the entire dataset, ignoring any local patterns or similarities specific to the new house's characteristics.\n\nThe correct answer C provides a balanced approach, considering enough neighbors to make a robust prediction while still maintaining relevance to the local area and specific characteristics of the new house."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/02/18", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221789", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/252328/"], "docs_id": 221789, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have seen some users who provide an answer, then add a comment \"If it works don't forget to accept my answer and upvote it\".\n\nOn seeing that type of comment, I get frustrated and try to flag it.

Can I simply replace all instances of *j* with an *h* and rid myself of an unnecessary second limit? If I could, my proof would continue as follows:\n3: Replacing all *j*'s with *h*'s yields:  \n\n$\\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}h\\\\cdot \\\\frac{F(a\\+h(n\\+1\\))\\-F(a\\+hn)}{h}$, and the *h*s can cancel out: $\\\\lim\\_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{(b\\-a)/h}F(a\\+h(n\\+1\\))\\-F(a\\+hn)$.  \n\n4: Thankfully, this becomes a telescoping series, as seen here:  \n\n$F(a\\+h(1\\))\\-F(a\\+0h) \\+ F(a\\+h(2\\))\\-F(a\\+1h) \\+ F(a\\+h(3\\))\\-F(a\\+2h) \\+ ... \\= \\-F(a\\-h) \\+ F(b\\-h)$  \n\n$ \\+ F(a\\+h(\\\\frac{b\\-a}{h}))\\-F(a\\+h(\\\\frac{b\\-a}{h}\\-1\\) \\= F(b) \\- F(b\\-h)$  \n\nwhich, together, yields \\-*F* (*a* \\- *h*) \\+ *F* (*b*) as the sum.  \n\nPutting this back in, we get $ \\\\lim\\_{h \\\\to 0} \\-F(a \\- h) \\+ F(b) \\= F(b) \\- F(a) \\= \\\\int\\_a^bf(x)dx \\= F(b)\\-F(a) $\n\nHowever, steps 3 and 4 require the ability for me to assume that *h* and *j* are the same thing.

Its main theme is exposing IObservable objects directly from the interfaces of our components.\n\n```\n// ********* Interfaces **********\ninterface IFooSource\n{\n    // this is the event-stream of objects of type Foo\n    IObservable<Foo> FooArrivals { get; }\n}\n\ninterface IBarSource\n{\n    // this is the event-stream of objects of type Bar\n    IObservable<Bar> BarArrivals { get; }\n}\n\n/ ********* Implementations *********\nclass FooSource : IFooSource\n{\n    // Here we put logic that receives Foo objects from the network and publishes them to the FooArrivals event stream.\n}\n\nclass FooSubsetsToBarConverter : IBarSource\n{\n    IFooSource fooSource;\n\n    IObservable<Bar> BarArrivals\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            // Do some fancy Rx operators on fooSource.FooArrivals, like Buffer, Window, Join and others and return IObservable<Bar>\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// this class will subscribe to the bar source and do processing\nclass BarsProcessor\n{\n    BarsProcessor(IBarSource barSource);\n    void Subscribe(); \n}\n\n// ******************* Main ************************\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var fooSource = FooSourceFactory.Create();\n        var barsProcessor = BarsProcessorFactory.Create(fooSource) // this will create FooSubsetToBarConverter and BarsProcessor\n\n        barsProcessor.Subscribe();\n        fooSource.Run(); // this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe other suggested another design that its main theme is using our own publisher/subscriber interfaces and using Rx inside the implementations only when needed.\n\n```\n//********** interfaces *********\n\ninterface IPublisher<T>\n{\n    void Subscribe(ISubscriber<T> subscriber);\n}\n\ninterface ISubscriber<T>\n{\n    Action<T> Callback { get; }\n}\n\n//********** implementations *********\n\nclass FooSource : IPublisher<Foo>\n{\n    public void Subscribe(ISubscriber<Foo> subscriber) { /* ...  */ }\n\n    // here we put logic that receives Foo objects from some source (the network?) publishes them to the registered subscribers\n}\n\nclass FooSubsetsToBarConverter  : ISubscriber<Foo>, IPublisher<Bar>\n{\n    void Callback(Foo foo)\n    {\n        // here we put logic that aggregates Foo objects and publishes Bars when we have received a subset of Foos that match our criteria\n        // maybe we use Rx here internally.\n    }\n\n    public void Subscribe(ISubscriber<Bar> subscriber) { /* ...  */ }\n}\n\nclass BarsProcessor : ISubscriber<Bar>\n{\n    void Callback(Bar bar)\n    {\n        // here we put code that processes Bar objects\n    }\n}\n\n//********** program *********\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var fooSource = fooSourceFactory.Create();\n        var barsProcessor = barsProcessorFactory.Create(fooSource) // this will create BarsProcessor and perform all the necessary subscriptions\n\n        fooSource.Run();  // this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhich one do you think is better? Exposing IObservable and making our components create new event streams from Rx operators, or defining our own publisher/subscriber interfaces and using Rx internally if needed?\n\nHere are some things to consider about the designs:\n\n* In the first design the consumer of our interfaces has the whole power of Rx at his/her fingertips and can perform any Rx operators. One of us claims this is an advantage and the other claims that this is a drawback.\n* The second design allows us to use any publisher/subscriber architecture under the hood. The first design ties us to Rx.\n* If we wish to use the power of Rx, it requires more work in the second design because we need to translate the custom publisher/subscriber implementation to Rx and back. It requires writing glue code for every class that wishes to do some event processing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think saying that `IObservable<T>` ties you to Rx is the same as saying that `IEnumerable<T>` ties you to LINQ. Yes, `IObservable<T>` is at the core of Rx and Rx lets you do a lot of things with `IObservable<T>`.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you have to use Rx to implement your classes, even if they inherit from `IObservable<T>`. And you also don't have to use Rx to work with the class, you could directly use `Subscribe()`. I believe this is also the reason why `IObservable<T>` is included in the core of the framework (it's in mscorlib since .Net 4\\), but Rx isn't.\n\nSo, unless `IObservable<T>` doesn't fit your needs, you should use it. On the plus side, you'll get the possibility to use Rx. On the negative side, you might need to wrap your implementation to make it look like `IObservable<T>`, if you decide to change the implementation later on. But you would have to do the same if you used a custom interface.\n\n`IObservable<T>` is just an interface, it doesn't tie you up to anything. But it gives you the ability to use libraries that already work with it, unlike a custom interface."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a .NET application processing large amounts of data, which approach is generally recommended for designing components that handle event streams?\n\nA) Always use custom publisher/subscriber interfaces to maintain full control over the implementation\nB) Exclusively use Rx (Reactive Extensions) and IObservable<T> for all event streaming scenarios\nC) Expose IObservable<T> in component interfaces, allowing flexibility to use Rx or custom implementations internally\nD) Avoid event streaming patterns altogether and use traditional polling mechanisms\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most appropriate approach for several reasons:\n\n1.

Future-proofing: If implementation details need to change in the future, the public interface remains stable, reducing the impact on consuming code.\n\n5.

In fact, an equation of continuity can be considered the defining feature of a local conservation law.\n\nIn the case of water flow, it is conservation of volume. That in turn is derived from the conservation of mass together with the fact that water is incompressible. The conservation of volume means that as the water stream moves faster it must get thinner.\n\nNote that in real water flows the surface tension eventually leads to the formation of drops. Then the stream does not get thinner but rather the drops get further apart."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A stream of water flows through a pipe that narrows from a diameter of 10 cm to 5 cm.

This scenario is explained by the equation of continuity, which is derived from the conservation of volume principle for incompressible fluids like water. As the pipe narrows, the cross-sectional area decreases. To maintain the same volume flow rate, the velocity must increase proportionally to the decrease in area. \n\nThe area ratio is (5cm/10cm)\u00b2 = 1/4, so the velocity must increase by a factor of 4 to compensate, going from 2 m/s to 8 m/s. This illustrates how \"as the water stream moves faster it must get thinner\" to conserve volume.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the velocity increases, not decreases.

How do two\\-dimensional waveform diagrams depict three properties of sound waves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Actually I have read (although I can't find a reference) that the subjectively perceived psychological notion of pitch itself, although very nearly wholly set by the sound wave's frequencies, *is* also weakly dependent on the intensity of the sound: that is, a higher intensity sound wave does seem ever so slightly sharper (higher in subjective pitch) than one of the same frequency but lower intensity. Hopefully another answerer to this question can add some more information.\n\nActually pitch and timbre are closely related. Timbre is primarily the *harmonic mix* of the sound wave: *i.e* if you wrote out a sound wave as:\n\n$$y(t) \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(A\\_k\\\\, \\\\cos(k\\\\,\\\\omega\\_0\\\\,t) \\+ B\\_k\\\\, \\\\sin(k\\\\,\\\\omega\\_0\\\\,t)\\\\right)$$\n\nthen, *approximately* we can make the following equations between physical properties of the sound waves (on the left) and subjective qualities of the sound perception experience (on the right):\n\n$$\\\\begin{array}{llcl}\\\\text{Fundamental frequency}\\&\\\\omega\\_0 \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"pitch\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\text{Intensity}\\& I \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(A\\_k^2\\+B\\_k^2\\\\right) \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"loudness\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\text{Relative Harmonic Mix}\\& \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{A\\_k^2\\+B\\_k^2}{I}}\\\\right)\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"Timbre\"}\\\\end{array}$$\n\nin other words, think of finding the relative amplitudes of each harmonic component and normalising them in an vector whose head lies on the unit sphere in $\\\\ell^2$. The normalised position on the unit sphere is the timbre, whilst the squared length of the unnormalised vecotr is the loudness.\n\nAS I said, the above are only approximate equations and a detailed answer would need to study the relevant psycho\\-acoustics carefully. Some interesting bits of trivia I've picked up as a singer and also learning to tune pianos:\n\n1. For many instruments \\- the piano's effervescent timbre is a good example \\- timbre has a great deal to do with nonlinear phenomenon of [*intermodulation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation), whereby sum and different frequencies produce significant components of the wave at frequencies that are away from the lowest frequency in a chord, so the Fourier series actually has a very low fundamental frequencies but only closely spaced, high harmonic number \"clusters\" of them around the harmonics of the perceived fundamental frequency are present;\n2. Modern pianos are NOT tuned to harmonics in a Fourier series, the are tuned to [equal temperament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), an invention mainly of J. S. Bach, whereby *every* semitone interval on the piano has the same frequency ratio, namely $2^{\\\\frac{1}{12}} $ so that, on a logarithmic frequency scale, the semitones are evenly spaced. The motivation is that frequency relationships between notes in a melody, chord and so forth are *then covariant with respect to any modulation (change of diatonic key)* in the music. This allows each key to be equally well in tune, which was the motivation for J.S.Bach's (or F. Chopin's) 24 preludes, each a variation on the same theme in each of the 12 diatonic keys in major and minor modes. They were, so to speak, \"showing off\" the possibilites openned up by realising, through equal temperament, the covariance of geometry of any musical pattern with respect to modulation. In contrast, flutes and clarinets, or any wind instrument that uses harmonics to realise several registers, are constrained by the instrument's physics to have the same fingering in different registers (*e.g.* $C\\_0$ and $G\\_1$ on a b\\-flat clarinet) *harmonically related*; most often a register jump corresponds to a tripling of frequency (corresponding to the first two harmonics of an open pipe). Therefore, not all instruments can play in all keys equally well. An upshot of all this is that it is certain that our subjective sense of pitch would be rather different from, say, Bach's contemporary Vivaldi, as we have learnt to ignore the \"out of tunehood\" of well tempered tuned notes (difference between them and those produced by a harmonic series);\n3. When chords are played with notes repeated at the harmonics, it becomes highly subjectives as to what is pitch and what is timbre and how accustomed the listener's ear's is to various instruments and their harmonic content weighs on the perceived pitches are in the chord. Experience with different instruments will cause the listener to group harmonics together as a single note differently, depending on what \"timbre\" is present in that instrument;\n4. In extreme cases, pitch and timbre become irresolvably tangled, as it does with in very big chords with equal spacings between them. If you play a dimished seventh chord or augmented chord (equal spacings of a minor and major third, respectively) spanning *many* octaves (you have to do this with a computer using something like Sibelius) and make an \"upwards\" or \"downwards\" progression by the equal step in the chord, it becomes about a 50% chance whether a listener will perceive the progression as upwards or downwards (this is because, if the series were truly infinite, there would be no difference in the change). I have a similar experience listening carefully to the bass line (left hand) in the third movement of Chopin's piano sonata \\#2 (Op 35\\): if you look at the score you see why: the notes in successive chords line up in endlessly rising \"stripes\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A piano tuner is explaining the concept of equal temperament to a music student.

However, if continuing after user cancellation is typically inappropriate, a non-zero exit code should be used.\n\nThis approach allows callers of the script to distinguish between successful completion and user cancellation. It's generally safer to use a non-zero exit code for cancellation, as it's easier for calling scripts to handle and provides more information. The key is to use distinct exit codes for different scenarios (e.g., user cancellation vs. error conditions) and to document these codes clearly.\n\nThis answer reflects the nuanced nature of exit code selection, emphasizing the importance of considering the script's typical usage patterns and the need for clear communication between scripts in larger workflows."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/26", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125607", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/40881/"], "docs_id": 125607, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am beginner Apple developer.

So plugin developer, who wanted to include third\\-party\\-modules/packages can't resolve that dependencies.\n\nThough there are functions within a python standard installation, that can be used from within python code to \"install\" third\\-party modules. You may use one of the solutions discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12332975/installing\\-python\\-module\\-within\\-code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12332975/installing-python-module-within-code), so each time the plugin is loaded by QGIS, you'll check if it can be imported, otherwise you install it.\n\nFor the specific package, browser\\-history, a simpler solution exists. Because that package has no further dependencies, you can integrate it into your Python plugin, by copying the whole package directory as a subfolder into the plugin folder. By doing this you'll get a package containing another package. So when importing `browser_history` inside your main plugin module you'll use a relative import ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative\\-imports\\-for\\-the\\-billionth\\-time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time)).\n\nThis looks like this, for example:\n\n```\nfrom . import browser_history\n\n```\n\nTo generalize the problem: each python module or packages which has no further dependencies, can be integrated into a Python plugin, but it is not more than a workaround with advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, if you try using pip inside your code, especially under Windows, using OSGeo4W, the use of pip may fail, when dependent modules use a C\\-Compiler for installation for example. That's why many python packages can be installed using the setup utility that comes with QGIS."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A QGIS user is experiencing issues with plugin dependencies and wants to incorporate a third-party module called \"browser_history\" into their custom QGIS plugin.

Ambient air is never in short supply and the \"exhaust\" (where the hot air picked up by the blade fan(s) are expelled) is located at the back of the unit (the black stripe on the newer models and the grey stripe on the first generation machines).\n\nSome claim that keeping the lid open allows the chassis to cool down, but these claims have never had any real data behind them (simply anecdotal evidence and unsubstantiated rumour). Personally, I have a 2006 MBP that was eventually relegated to being a desktop. I ran the system for well over a year with the clamshell open, and then closed, and saw no different in CPU/CPU temps (nor any variability in the other heat sensors) as a result. Moreover, the newer models have far more efficient blade fans and would suffer even less from the effects of heat (additionally, the new Intel chipsets run cooler than their predecessors). You can conduct your own testing of course. I had replaced the heat sink, re\\-applied a sane amount of Arctic Silver thermal paste, and used [Lobotomo Fan Control](http://www.lobotomo.com/products/FanControl/) daemon to monitor my system's temperature.\n\n**Disabling the internal display, properly**\n\nThere are two ways to connect a secondary display to your notebook without enabling the default screen (note that this does not mean dimming it, but rather turning it off).\n\n1. The first is to connect the display with the lid closed when the machine is powered down. Once the external display is connected, turn the machine on\u2014it will detect the secondary display while leaving the internal one turned off. This will alleviate the issues you have with \"dragging things off the screen\" as the system will constrain your desktop to the one, active monitor.\n2. The second is to connect the secondary display when your system is awake and active, and the clamshell open. Make sure the notebook is plugged in. Once you connect the secondary monitor, the system will recognize it. Once it does, close the lid on your notebook. The device will be put to sleep. Once that happens, move your mouse, or hit a key on your keyboard to wake it. Once it wakens, it will enable the secondary display, but not the internal one.\n\nAdditionally, you may set the attribute to leave the system in the sleep state even if the clamshell is opened. You can do this using [pmset](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html), a local utility found on OS X that actually handles all your power settings. You can accomplish this with the following command:\n\n```\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\n```\n\n*The \\-a, \\-b, \\-c, \\-u flags determine whether the settings apply to battery ( \\-b ), charger (wall power) ( \\-c ), UPS ( \\-u ) or all ( \\-a ).*\n\nTo reverse the command, set the 0 to a 1\\. These settings are persistent, in that, they do not need to be re\\-applied every time the machine's power is cycled and are saved to the file: `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A MacBook Pro user wants to disable the internal display when an external monitor is connected, while keeping the laptop lid open.

As explained in the documentation, this method allows the user to connect an external display while the system is awake, then close the lid to put the device to sleep. When woken up using the mouse or keyboard, the system will enable only the external display, leaving the internal one off.\n\nOption C is incorrect because dimming the display is not the same as disabling it. The internal display would still be active and windows could still appear on it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Lobotomo Fan Control is mentioned in the context of monitoring system temperature, not managing display settings.\n\nThe correct method allows the user to effectively disable the internal display while keeping the lid open, which meets the user's requirements for maintaining airflow and sound quality."}}
