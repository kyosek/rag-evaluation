This method addresses the issue of Xcode retaining references to deleted files by first restoring the old image, re-adding it to Xcode, then properly removing it both from Xcode and the file system. This process clears any lingering references before adding the new image, preventing the error shown in the question.

Ground is a reference point and it's easy to get a negative voltage if your ground reference is above earth ground. Does a differential power supply actually produce a negate voltage (referenced to earth ground) or does it just use a voltage offset from ground as a ground reference.\n\nFor example a \\+\\-5V power supply can easily be created by using two voltages (\\+10V, \\+5V) and GND. If you use \\+5V as ground, it will make \\+10V the \\+5 equivalent. GND will become the \\-5V equivalent. The problem with such a circuit is that ground isn't compatible with earth ground. For example you can't then tie your newly created (\\+5V offset) ground to earth ground without creating a short circuit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Voltage may be interpreted as a measure of the potential energy of a theoretical test charge divided by its magnitude (dimensionally, volts are joules per coulomb). As with many potentials in classical physics, this is a relative quantity, meaning that your measurement of a potential is between some two points or states.\n\nPhysically, there is nothing incompatible with the idea that the relative potential of some point P is negative when referenced to earth ground, or any other reference for that matter. All it means is that a theoretical positive charge would lose some amount of potential energy when moving from your earth ground or reference to P.\n\nWe can easily realize this by demonstration with a number of examples that should prove that there's \"truly\" such a thing as a negative DC voltage with reference to earth ground:\n\n1. Electrochemical: Suppose that the ground pin at left is physically earthed by bonding it to earth ground (e.g. by burying an electrode into wet dirt outdoors). The `-5V` label clearly and demonstrably has a negative voltage with respect to earth ground.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFGkQ.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fpFGkQ.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\n2. Charge pumps and switching regulators: There are a number of circuit topologies that can produce a negative voltage given a positive supply. The simplest would be a charge pump, where a capacitor is alternately charged and discharged:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lq83i.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2flq83i.png)\n\nAssume, as before, that the ground symbol may be understood as earthing or the use of any reference convenient to you.\n\nInitially, SW1 and SW3 are closed, causing the potential at A to rise above the potential at B. Then, SW1 and SW3 are opened, and then SW2 and SW4 are closed. Since A is below B, but A is now connected to ground (be it earth ground, your Arduino's GND connection, Mars ground, etc), hence B and VOUT are both below earth ground. With the addition of extra capacitors, and the use of fast semiconductor switches, this is something that is [commercially realized](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/3261fb.pdf) as a practical way to produce voltages lower than your lowest supply.\n\nWith the appropriate safety precautions and appropriate components and measurement tools, you should be able to verify both of these examples and claims for yourself if you so desire."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit designer needs to create a -5V supply for a sensitive analog circuit in a system where the main power supply only provides +12V and GND. Which of the following methods would be most appropriate to generate the required -5V, assuming the circuit requires a true negative voltage with respect to earth ground?\n\nA) Use a voltage divider to create +5V and use it as a new reference ground\nB) Implement a charge pump circuit with appropriate switching elements\nC) Connect the negative terminal of the +12V supply to earth ground\nD) Use two series-connected 6V Zener diodes in reverse\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This method would create a virtual ground at +5V, but wouldn't produce a true negative voltage relative to earth ground.\nB) A charge pump circuit can generate a true negative voltage from a positive supply, making it suitable for creating -5V from +12V.\nC) This would short circuit the power supply and potentially cause damage.\nD) Zener diodes in reverse would regulate voltage, but cannot generate a negative voltage from a positive supply.\n\nThe charge pump (option B) is the most appropriate solution as it can produce a genuine negative voltage referenced to earth ground, as explained in the documentation. It uses switches and capacitors to effectively \"pump\" charge to create a voltage lower than the ground reference."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/09", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/869977", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/92582/"], "docs_id": 869977, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I tried to install `libimobiledevice` only to see that I get the following error: \n\n```\nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice\nReading package lists...

But the input impedance of the second stage should probably be higher than the output impedance of the first stage, or the second stage will load the first stage and limit your operating range.\n\nAn ideal amplifier has infinite input impedance and zero output impedance, or at least a reasonable facsimile of those conditions. On the other hand, if your first stage tries to drive 10V through an output impedance is 1k and into an input impedance of 10 ohms, then the second stage will receive $$\\\\frac{10V\\\\cdot10}{(1k\\+10\\)ohms} \\= 0\\.1V.$$ \n\nIn your case, you're driving through 20k into 50k.

First, if you haven't included the jersey\\-json artifact, it won't do JSON at all. That can cause the error that you posted. Second, JAXB uses annotations to determine how to marshal and unmarshal things. In order to marshal an object with JAXB, its class must be annotated with [@XmlRootElement](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlRootElement.html). If a class isn't annotated so, Jersey will think it doesn't know how to marshal the object, and again, you'll get that same error. I'm not 100% clear on the use of GenericEntity, having never needed it myself, but I don't think that will help you here. I believe there are two commonly\\-accepted solutions to your problem:\n\n1. Wrap your Map in a [JAXBElement](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXBElement.html).\n2. Write your own wrapper for the map which is annotated with @XmlRootElement.\n\nMost people tend to choose the second option, I think.

Which of the following statements is true about this map?\n\nA) It is both equiareal and a local isometry.\nB) It is equiareal but not a local isometry.\nC) It is a local isometry but not equiareal.\nD) It is neither equiareal nor a local isometry.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis map f(x,y) = (x+y, y) is indeed equiareal but not a local isometry.\n\nTo see that it's equiareal, we can compute the Jacobian determinant:\n\u2202(x+y)/\u2202x = 1, \u2202(x+y)/\u2202y = 1\n\u2202y/\u2202x = 0, \u2202y/\u2202y = 1\nDet J = 1(1) - 1(0) = 1\n\nSince the Jacobian determinant is 1 everywhere, the map preserves areas and is thus equiareal.\n\nHowever, it's not a local isometry because it doesn't preserve distances. For example, consider the vector (1,0). Under this map, it becomes (1,0), which has the same length. But the vector (0,1) becomes (1,1), which is longer than the original vector.\n\nIn terms of the first fundamental form, for the original plane we have E\u2081 = G\u2081 = 1, F\u2081 = 0. For the image under f, we get E\u2082 = 2, G\u2082 = 1, F\u2082 = 1. These are not the same, so f is not a local isometry.\n\nThis example demonstrates that a map can preserve areas without preserving distances or angles, making it an equiareal map that is not a local isometry."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/11", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/150139", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/135806/"], "docs_id": 150139, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I came across\n\n[c\\#.net convert date yyyyMMdd to system.datetime format.?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720468/c-net-convert-date-yyyymmdd-to-system-datetime-format)\n\nwhile performing a Google search on a related topic.

Here is an illustration of the dataset:\n\n```\nHome_segment     Away_segment     Outcome\n2                4                0\n3                1                1\n7                1                0\n4                2                1\n1                3                0\n...\nn rows\n...\n3                6                1\n1                7                0\n\n```\n\nAs constructed, you'll note that segment 4 appears to have an advantage over segment 2, and if the pattern continued through the data, this would be a useful insight.\n\nMy question, however, is that in creating a predictor using \"home\" and \"away\" in this format, the information contained by the \"reverse perspectives\" appears to be discarded. That is, when segment 4 becomes the home segment, and 2 is the away segment, it seems to me that the prior relationship is not considered in the modelling solution.\n\nShould I effective \"double\" my dataset by reversing the home / away positions? Do I introduce independence issues by doing so? Interested in perspectives and how I can most effectively model using a dataset with this construct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first thing to note is that the logistic regression model you describe in your comments has *more* parameters ($n^2 \\+ 2n$) than there are segment combinations ($n^2$), meaning that it is *overparametrized* and therefore will just give you the observed frequency of wins for each possible combination.\n\nIf that is what you are interested in, you don't really need to perform logistic regression \\- simply count the number of wins for each combination and treat it as a standard binomial estimation problem (with $k$ wins for a given segment out of $m$ games). This way you can deal with symmetry by considering reversed positions as the same combination \\- just count for example (4,2\\) and (2,4\\) together, so you have in total $n(n\\+1\\)/2$ combinations instead of $n^2$, and you get a estimated win probability for each."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a card game prediction model where home and away segments are analyzed, what is the most appropriate method to handle the symmetry of information and avoid overparameterization?\n\nA) Double the dataset by reversing home and away positions for each entry\nB) Use logistic regression with n^2 + 2n parameters, where n is the number of segments\nC) Treat reversed positions as the same combination and use binomial estimation for n(n+1)/2 combinations\nD) Create separate models for home and away segments to capture unique advantages\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate method because it addresses the symmetry issue by considering reversed positions (e.g., 4,2 and 2,4) as the same combination. This approach reduces the number of combinations from n^2 to n(n+1)/2, avoiding overparameterization. It also allows for standard binomial estimation of win probabilities for each unique combination, providing a more efficient and statistically sound method for analyzing the data. Options A and B would lead to overparameterization or redundancy, while option D doesn't address the symmetry issue and may not capture the relationships between segment combinations effectively."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/25", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1161090", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/973320/"], "docs_id": 1161090, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have error when try to open steam:\n\n```\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 18.04 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nPins up-to-date!\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Startup - updater built Jul 17 2019 06:13:47\nSteamUpdateUI: An X Error occurred\nX Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext\nSteamUpdateUI: An X Error occurred\nX Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\nMajor opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)\nMinor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)\nValue in failed request:  0x0\nSerial number of failed request:  45\nxerror_handler: X failed, continuing\nMajor opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)\nMinor opcode of failed request:  6 (X_GLXIsDirect)\nSerial number of failed request:  46\nxerror_handler: X failed, continuing\nLooks like steam didn't shutdown cleanly, scheduling immediate update check\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Checking for update on startup\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Checking for available updates...\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Downloading manifest: client-download.steampowered.com/client/steam_client_ubuntu12\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Download skipped by HTTP 304 Not Modified\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Nothing to do\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Verifying installation...\n[2019-07-26 00:23:06] Performing checksum verification of executable files\n[2019-07-26 00:23:07] Verification complete\n\n```\n\ninformation of system:\n**uname \\-a**\n\n```\nLinux home-PC 4.18.0-25-generic #26~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 27 07:28:31 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The instructions on this page worked for me (Ubuntu 18\\.04, GTX 1650s): <https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md>\n\nNvidia:\n\nTo get the latest Nvidia drivers it is necessary to add the Proprietary GPU Drivers PPA:\n\n`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa`\n\nEnable 32 bit architecture (if you haven't already):\n\n`sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`\n\nUpdate to refresh packages:\n\n`sudo apt update`\n\nWarning: Please ensure your graphics card is supported by the 430 driver before installing.

Or it will remain stuck forever?`  \n\n`Is Gravity continuous, that holds the object in equilibrium state?`  \n\n`Will the small object act as a medium to attract both masses that will make them revolve around the smaller one?`\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are working in Newtonian gravity (I assume you are, seeing the tag) and therefore you neglect all relativistic/quantum effects, then **the central mass will stay in the same spot** if placed exactly in the center of mass of the system.\n\nThe two bigger masses will be attracted towards the center by the small mass and the other big mass (and nothing stops them) while the small mass will be pulled in two opposite directions with the same magnitude, therefore (since the gravitational force, same as any force, is a vector) the two will cancel out.  \n\nFor the conservation of angular momentum, if the system isn't rotating at the beginning it will continue to not rotate, and the movement will be completely linear along the axis passing through the center of the bodies.  \n\nAs for the \"is gravity continuous\", it certainly is in Newtonian gravity, as well as in General Relativity (the best we can nowadays do to explain gravity). However, the question in a Quantum\\-Gravity environment is far from obvious: we just don't know.\n\nBonus: you can generalize this question with different, moving masses. It's the [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) problem and the point you're asking about is [L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L1) that can be found (numerically in general, analytically with some assumptions)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a theoretical scenario involving three spherical masses in space with no initial velocity, a small object M is placed exactly between two larger identical masses M1 and M2. Assuming Newtonian gravity and neglecting all relativistic/quantum effects, what would be the behavior of the small object M?\n\nA) M will move towards M1 due to slight gravitational imbalances\nB) M will oscillate back and forth between M1 and M2\nC) M will remain stationary at its initial position\nD) M will cause M1 and M2 to orbit around it\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Newtonian gravity, the small object M will remain stationary at its initial position. This is because it is placed at the center of mass of the system, experiencing equal gravitational pulls from both M1 and M2 in opposite directions. These forces cancel each other out, resulting in no net force on M. The larger masses M1 and M2 will be attracted towards the center by both the small mass M and each other, but M itself will not move if it's exactly centered. This scenario is analogous to the Lagrange point L1 in celestial mechanics. The system's angular momentum is conserved, and since it starts with no rotation, it will continue without rotation, with any movement being linear along the axis passing through the centers of the bodies."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/26", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/453907", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/148466/"], "docs_id": 453907, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A few months ago I went to do a search from the Firefox search page (the default home page) on my computer and one of the previously run searches in the dropdown was for \"pee porn.\" At the time it was a little upsetting as I thought maybe my temporary housemate was responsible, but the dates and times related to the search didn't add up.

In the Magento API, you need to set the value and then tell it that you set the value.\n\nHere's an example below:\n\n```\nDim objWS As MagentoService\nDim inventoryResult As Integer = objWS.catalogInventoryStockItemUpdate(\n    sSessionId,\n    sku,\n    New catalogInventoryStockItemUpdateEntity With \n        {\n            .manage_stock = 1,              \n            .manage_stockSpecified = True, \n            .is_in_stock = 1, \n            .is_in_StockSpecified = True, \n            .qty = 1\n        })\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When updating catalog inventory stock for a particular item in Magento using the SOAP API, which of the following code snippets correctly sets both the quantity and the \"manage stock\" flag?\n\nA) \n```\nNew catalogInventoryStockItemUpdateEntity With \n{\n    .manage_stock = 1, \n    .qty = 1\n}\n```\n\nB) \n```\nNew catalogInventoryStockItemUpdateEntity With \n{\n    .manage_stock = 1, \n    .manage_stockSpecified = True, \n    .qty = 1\n}\n```\n\nC) \n```\nNew catalogInventoryStockItemUpdateEntity With \n{\n    .manage_stock = 1, \n    .is_in_stock = 1, \n    .qty = 1\n}\n```\n\nD) \n```\nNew catalogInventoryStockItemUpdateEntity With \n{\n    .manage_stock = 1, \n    .manage_stockSpecified = True, \n    .is_in_stock = 1,\n    .is_in_stockSpecified = True, \n    .qty = 1\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In the Magento API, when updating inventory stock, you need to not only set the value but also explicitly specify that you've set the value. Option B correctly sets the `manage_stock` flag to 1 and also sets `manage_stockSpecified` to True, which tells the API that this value has been intentionally set. Option A doesn't specify that `manage_stock` has been set, C doesn't use the required \"Specified\" flags, and D includes unnecessary `is_in_stock` settings."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/06", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/155841", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/53379/"], "docs_id": 155841, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a website to design.

You can try setting a desired training error **e** and a maximum number of epochs **n**. If **n** is reached before **e** is achieved, stop the training and start testing, and the lowest error will be reported as the training error of the model. You train with 9 folders, and test with the other one.\n\nI think you might be confused about training and test error. Training error is achieved iteratively, the parameters are changing; testing error is achieved with fixed parameters, there is no epoch number for testing error.\n\nNevertheless, ***always*** make it clear how you're doing the training/testing!"}, "answer": "Question: A researcher is studying the relationship between individual plant heights and average temperature across multiple populations.

Here's why:\n\nA) While this approach reduces the data to the population level, it loses information about individual variation within populations and reduces statistical power.\n\nB) This method artificially inflates the sample size and violates the assumption of independence, potentially leading to spurious correlations.\n\nC) A mixed-effects model is ideal for this scenario as it accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data (plants nested within populations) while allowing for the analysis of both individual- and population-level effects. It can handle the repeated measures within populations and the single temperature measurement per population.\n\nD) This approach wastes a lot of data and introduces unnecessary randomness into the analysis.\n\nThe mixed-effects model (C) is the best choice because it preserves all the data, accounts for the data structure, and allows for proper inference about the relationship between plant height and temperature while controlling for population-level effects."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/28", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/364613", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/30996/"], "docs_id": 364613, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been trying to get LDAP authentication and NFS exported home directories on CentOS 6 working for a few days now.

It's also bounded above. $sup S\\=3$ also exists in $\\\\mathbb Q$. But the set of rational numbers does not have a supremum!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My answer will have to be \"yes and no\".\n\nIn the formal sense, the answer is no. $\\\\ell^p$ consists of elements of the form $a: \\\\mathbb N \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb C$. However, such a finite sequence is something of the form $a: \\\\{1, \\\\dots, N\\\\} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb C$. This is not a function with domain $\\\\mathbb N$ so strictly speaking it is not in $\\\\ell^p$.\n\nHowever, I think this question relates to a deeper concept than mere formalism \\- it's about how math is communicated. We are not always so strict in math. Surely, speaking strictly is useful. We must be precise when doing math, as subtle errors abound, especially when one is encountering a new topic. However, we often abuse notation and speak more loosely when we are working practically, as strictness can become cumbersome. Ultimately, math is a communicative process. What you write down is meant to be understood by another person doing math. If I read \"$\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$\" it would be immediately clear to me that what you meant is the extension by $0$ you describe. This is a routine thing to do, and contextually the meaning is clear. It may even be annoying for a reader if you were to belabor this point, but this depends on your audience. As with any form of speech, the particular language mathematicians use has imprecisions that are filled in by contextual understanding. It's the duty of a good author to determine what things their audience can pick up from context and what things must be spelled out.\n\nLet me give another example. Is $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$? Well sure, we say this all the time. But often we consider $\\\\mathbb C$ to be the set $\\\\mathbb R^2$ with additional structure. Elements of $\\\\mathbb R^2$ are pairs of real numbers, and a real number is not a pair of real numbers, so if we again insist on speaking strictly, then it's not true that $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$. But this is pedantry. We do freely think about the real numbers as sitting in the complex numbers without caring that on a technical set theoretic level it may not be strictly true. On that note, objects are not always even well defined. Are complex numbers pairs of real numbers? Cosets in $\\\\mathbb R\\[x]/(x^2 \\+ 1\\)$? Are real numbers equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences? Dedekind cuts? None of these sets contain one another, but does it really matter? When I say $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$ or $\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$, I expect my audience to be able to infer the meaning of these statements without my having to spell out all the little details. Doing so would be tedious for both me as an author, and for the reader to actually read.\n\nI'll leave you with some rough guidelines, but I myself am a novice in mathematical writing. I'd encourage you to seek out experts who have written about this, such as [Terry Tao on his blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/) (EDIT: [This](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/on-compilation-errors-in-mathematical-reading-and-how-to-resolve-them/) particular post on \"compilation errors\" is especially relevant) or any personal mentors you have. Additionally, having peers and members of your intended audience comment on what you've written is deeply important.\n\nFirst and foremost, especially as a beginner, is to be correct and precise. You must be completely sure that everything you write down is correct, and that any skipped details are things you can readily fill in if asked. If you write down $\\\\mathbb R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb C$ or $\\\\{a\\_n\\\\}\\_{n\\=1}^N \\\\in \\\\ell^p$, be prepared to defend it!\n\nSecondly, think about who your audience is. Are you writing homework for a class? Perhaps then the grader will want to see every detail spelled out to determine if you are indeed capable of doing so. Are you preparing lecture notes for people learning analysis for the first time? Maybe this abuse of notation would confuse them. For advanced graduate students? They're probably used to things like this. Are these notes just for you? Are they for a textbook? Each audience and medium will have different expectations and standards. You should consider what your audience is likely to know, how much time they have to sit and digest the material itself, and what constraints the medium imposes \\- like if you have only an hour for a talk."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following statements about mathematical notation and communication:\n\nI. In formal mathematics, it is always correct to write {a_n}_{n=1}^N \u2208 \u2113^p for a finite sequence.\nII. The statement \u211d \u2286 \u2102 is strictly true from a set-theoretic perspective.\nIII. The appropriate level of mathematical rigor depends on the intended audience.\nIV. When writing mathematics, it's crucial to be prepared to defend any notational abuses or shortcuts used.\n\nWhich combination of these statements is most accurate?\n\nA) I and II only\nB) III and IV only\nC) I, II, and III only\nD) II, III, and IV only\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nStatement I is false. The text explicitly states that finite sequences are not strictly elements of \u2113^p spaces, which consist of functions from \u2115 to \u2102.\n\nStatement II is also false. The text points out that if we consider \u2102 as \u211d^2 with additional structure, then real numbers are not strictly subsets of complex numbers from a set-theoretic viewpoint.\n\nStatement III is true. The text emphasizes that the level of rigor and detail in mathematical communication should be tailored to the audience and context.\n\nStatement IV is true.

If a user only asks two or three questions on a site (let's use [Home Improvement](http://diy.stackexchange.com) as an example) and receives really excellent responses, but then goes inactive for six months, why would deactivating their account help? This is a user who is *more likely* to go out to his friends/neighbors and tell them about the site, how much it helped him/her, and how fast/good the responses were. These are all our core competencies, and creating a punishment for this user would create a certain amount of negative dissonance. I don't like making barriers to entry for a user who could \"pay it forward\" and thus help *us* out long\\-term.\n2. Take a user like [Karl Katzke](https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/3450/karl-katzke), a 5k\\+ user on DIY who's been largely inactive for the last year or so. He's mentioned that his lack of activity is entirely due to the [demands of his real\\-life job](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/111?m=5682430#5682430). Users like this are the ones we want to *come back and be welcomed*. Forcing him to take on a penalty for his absence \\-\\- which was by no means voluntary \\-\\- isn't fair and doesn't breed goodwill with our community.   \n\n I'm all for encouraging our top users to stick around \\-\\- but that's what [the Fanatic badge](https://diy.stackexchange.com/badges/55/fanatic) is for. Forcing a punishment for not showing up to a *volunteer internet site* feels mean\\-spirited.\n3. Tracking this would be a pain. What would be a \"fair\" deduction? What period constitutes inactive? Activity levels vary by communities, due to their nature (Gardening and DIY are seasonal, SO and SF are not, academic subjects and Academia.SE have a 75/25 split in their activity over the course of the year) and tracking these would have to be custom per\\-site. That's taxing on our system.\n\nppumpkin, sure, this election is over. But that doesn't make you powerless as a user.

For example one might take first the largest prime divisor and then the smallest (when starting with a non\\-prime).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As defined, $d \\\\geq b$ , so iterating $F$ will lead to a fixed point $qr$, a product of a prime $q$ which is no larger than any prime factor of $r$ and such that $(r\\+1\\)$ is $q$\\-smooth. Most of the time, $F(a)$ will be odd, and often will be smaller than $a$ by an amount at least as large as $\\\\sqrt{a}$. This suggests the period of $a$ is $O(\\\\sqrt{a})$, and probably the period is much smaller.\n\nAs $a$ decreases by even numbers, I expect $b$ to be small with a frequency about as expected, meaning that about 7/15 of the values of $b$ will be 3 or 5\\. A nice quantity to know is $\\\\mid \\\\{ a \\\\leq n: F(a)\\=a\\\\}\\\\mid/n$, the density of fixed points. This will likely be near 1/average length of period, but that is another guess. They will be at least as dense as somewhat smooth numbers: for numbers $c$ whose largest prime factor is $q$ and have many small prime factors, $c\\-q$ will often be a fixed point for $F$.\n\nGuy's book Unsolved Problems In Number Theory has problems involving iterated number theoretic functions.

displaying the result?\n\nA) The form submits data directly to the Result controller, which processes the data and returns a JSON response containing the result HTML.\n\nB) The form submission triggers an AJAX call to the Index controller, which then redirects to the Result controller for processing and displaying the result.\n\nC) The form submits data to the Index controller, which then uses the ResultJsonFactory to return the calculated BMI directly as a JSON response.\n\nD) The form submission triggers an AJAX call to the Result controller, which processes the data, creates a block with the result template, and returns the block HTML as a JSON response.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct flow is described in option D. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The form in calculation.phtml uses JavaScript to submit data via AJAX to the Result controller (Vendor\\Module\\Controller\\Result\\Result).\n2. The Result controller's execute() method receives the height and weight parameters.\n3. It then creates a new block instance, sets the template to result.phtml, and passes the height and weight data to the block.\n4. The controller renders the block to HTML and wraps it in a JSON response.\n5. The AJAX success callback in the JavaScript receives this JSON response, which contains the rendered HTML of the result.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because:\nA) While close, it implies direct form submission rather than AJAX.\nB) Incorrectly involves the Index controller in the process.\nC) Incorrectly suggests that the BMI calculation happens in the controller, when in fact the module seems to pass the raw data to the template for processing.\n\nThis question tests understanding of Magento 2's controller structure, AJAX interactions, and the flow of data in a custom module."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/07", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/214640", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/156311/"], "docs_id": 214640, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm replacing the hard drive in my 2009 macbook (13\" unibody).

In theory it is always possible to make an unambiguous measurement.\n\nHowever, things get complicated when one restricts oneself to a certain class of measurements. With so called LOCC (Local Operations and Classical Communication, that is, we have to measure particles separately, but we are allowed to communicate and to have dependence for measurements on the outcomes of previous measurement) still it is possible to unambiguously distinguish any two states (see: Walgate et al., *Local Distinguishability of Multipartite Orthogonal Quantum States*, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 23: 4972\\-4975 (2000\\) [arXiv:quant\\-ph/0007098](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0007098)).\n\nWith fixed local operations (and thus classical communications only after all measurements are done) sometimes we can't unambiguously distinguish between $\\|\\\\psi \\\\rangle$ and $\\|\\\\phi \\\\rangle$.\n\n* Is there any simple argument why?\n* Are there any simple criteria which says which orthogonal states can be unambiguously distinguished with local measurements and communication only after them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To keep things simple, let's talk about two\\-qubit states.\n\nA single qubit could have an orthonormal basis $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$. But it could also have a different orthonormal basis $\\\\{\\|\\+\\\\rangle,\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$, where $$\\|\\+\\\\rangle \\= \\\\large(\\\\normalsize\\|0\\\\rangle \\\\small\\+\\\\normalsize \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\large)\\\\normalsize / \\\\sqrt{2}$$ $$\\|\\-\\\\rangle \\= \\\\large(\\\\normalsize\\|0\\\\rangle \\\\small\\-\\\\normalsize \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\large)\\\\normalsize / \\\\sqrt{2}$$\r\n\nNo suppose the two states you're trying to distinguish are: $$\\|\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\= \\\\large(\\\\normalsize\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle \\\\small\\+\\\\normalsize \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle\\\\large)\\\\normalsize / \\\\sqrt{2}$$ and $$\\|\\\\phi\\\\rangle \\= \\\\large(\\\\normalsize\\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle \\\\small\\+\\\\normalsize \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\large)\\\\normalsize / \\\\sqrt{2}$$\r\n\nHere the first qubit in each term is Alice's and the second qubit in each term is Bob's.  \n\nLet's say Alice does a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis. After the measurement the state will be projected into a new state, but *which* new state depends on the result of Alice's measurement.  \n\nIf Alice observes state $\\|0\\\\rangle$: $$\\|\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle$$ $$\\|\\\\phi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle$$\r\n\nIf Alice observes state $\\|1\\\\rangle$:$$\\|\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle$$ $$\\|\\\\phi\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle$$\r\n\nIf Bob *knows* Alice observes $\\|0\\\\rangle$, then he can distinguish the two states by making a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis. Likewise, if Bob *knows* Alice observes $\\|1\\\\rangle$, then he can distinguish the two states by making a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|\\+\\\\rangle,\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis.  \n\n**But if Bob doesn't know the result of Alice's measurement until *after* he makes his measurement, then he doesn't know *which* measurement to make.**  \n\nIf the true state is $\\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle$ but Bob guesses it's either $\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle$, then he's going to make a measurement in the $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ basis. This means he's equally likely to observe $\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|1\\\\rangle$, since the true state of his qubit, $\\|\\+\\\\rangle$, is an equal superposition of $\\|0\\\\rangle$ and $\\|1\\\\rangle$. Note that even if the true state of his qubit were $\\|\\-\\\\rangle$ (the only other possibility after Alice's measurement), Bob would still have been equally likely to observe $\\|0\\\\rangle$ or $\\|1\\\\rangle$.  \n\nSo after comparing results, Alice and Bob realize that Bob's measurement tells them nothing, and moreover the result of Alice's measurement by itself does nothing to distinguish the two initial states.  \n\n**Edit:**  \n\nI'm going to try to give a more general rule for which states Alice and Bob can distinguish with local measurements only (no communication until afterwards.)  \n\nIf Alice and Bob aren't going to communicate until their measurements are done, then the combined measurement is effectively chosen before hand. As Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grosshans points out in his answer, this measurement will be a projection into the eigenbasis of $A \\\\otimes B$, where $A$ is a local observable that Alice can measure and $B$ is a local observable that Bob can measure.  \n\nIf $S\\_A$ is the set of eigenstates of $A$, and $S\\_B$ is the set of eigenstates of $B$, then the set of eigenstates of $A \\\\otimes B$ is the direct product (the Cartesian product) of $S\\_A$ and $S\\_B$.  \n\nAs an example, if $S\\_A \\= S\\_B \\= \\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$, Alice and Bob will only distinguish $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$. If $S\\_A \\= \\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle,\\|1\\\\rangle\\\\}$ and $S\\_B \\= \\\\{\\|\\+\\\\rangle,\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$, Alice and Bob will only distinguish $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$.  \n\nIf you have a set like my two entangled states above, or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grosshans' four states $\\\\{\\|0\\\\rangle\\|0\\\\rangle, \\|0\\\\rangle\\|1\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\+\\\\rangle, \\|1\\\\rangle\\|\\-\\\\rangle\\\\}$, then there's no choice of $A$ and $B$ that will suffice, because these states aren't in the direct product of the eigenstates of two local measurements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Alice and Bob are trying to distinguish between two orthogonal two-qubit states:\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9|+\u27e9) / \u221a2 and \n|\u03c6\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9|1\u27e9 + |1\u27e9|-\u27e9) / \u221a2\nIf they are restricted to making local measurements without communicating until after both have measured, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) They can always distinguish the states with certainty by choosing appropriate measurement bases.\n\nB) They can never distinguish the states, regardless of their choice of measurement bases.\n\nC) They can distinguish the states if Alice measures in the {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9} basis and Bob measures in the {|+\u27e9, |-\u27e9} basis.\n\nD) They cannot reliably distinguish the states because the eigenbasis of their combined measurement (A \u2297 B) does not include all possible outcomes needed to differentiate |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03c6\u27e9.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key point is that without communication, Alice and Bob must choose their measurement bases independently. Their combined measurement is effectively a projection into the eigenbasis of A \u2297 B, where A is Alice's observable and B is Bob's.

There are tens of thousands of such questions on SO. Now with the CS Theory site, what is happening is that random \\[algorithm] questions are being migrated to the CS Theory, or just closed as \"off topic\". There is no rhyme or reason other than random chance. In theory I suppose 90% of the \\[algorithm] tagged posts could be moved to CS Theory, but the problem is that SO has nearly 2 million users and practically nobody uses CS Theory. Who wants to post a question to a forum with 11,000 (low time) users when you could post to SO with almost 2,000,000 users? Nobody. Getting migrated to CS is like getting your post deleted.\n\nAlso, as an algorithm \"answerer\" I do not want to visit two different forums. I do not want to be switching back and forth. Also I DEFINITELY do not want my badge/rep efforts to be split between two forums. I want my rep to be on ONE site, SO, because that is where I am asking my questions, which are often not algorithm related.\n\nI used to paticipate in a machining forum and posted to General a set of really interesting photos that would be of general interest to machinists and the moderator force moved my post to the \"fabrication\" sub forum that had literally \\<1% of the population of the general forum just because some of the photos were tangentially fabrication related. It was more or less equivalent to deleting my post, that I spent a LOT of time on. I stopped using that forum.\n\nI am wondering if anybody agrees with me that this is a serious problem that is causing fragmentation in posts in the \\[algorithm] tag and what we can do about it?\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- EXAMPLE\n\nTo provide a concrete example, here is some guy's post: [TSP question post on SO that got migrated](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12485/evolutionary-algorithm-for-the-physical-travelling-salesman-problem).

Some processors don't support hardware virtualization and some BIOSes when combined with those processors don't report that correctly. The ability to specifically turn off the hardware virtualization is a plus in those instances. There are probably also some concerns about stability. It is a newer technology, if a stability or performance bug crops up it's easier to tell people to disable virtualization in the BIOS then to tell everyone to update their BIOS to a version that allows them to turn it off.

It's rather the right hand side of the assignment `a + b` that is synthesized into hardware. Strictly speaking a variable never is synthesized into combinatorial logic.\n2.

VHDL variables can be synthesized in different ways depending on their usage in the code:\n\n1. They may have no hardware representation at all if they are used to hold intermediate results within a single clock cycle.\n2.

They can be unintentionally synthesized as latches in certain conditions, such as when there are incomplete conditional branches.\n4.

(note that \\_ and \\_\\_ are not reserved for the same things, see comments)\n\nEven if the names are under scope (namespace, class, etc.), there can be some global names, in particular macros, which use these prefix and might silently break your code if you use them too.\n\nSo, basically, most of the time it is safe to use these prefix BUT if you don't use them you have a 100% guarantee that your naming will never conflict with the implementation names.\n\nWhich is why, in doubt, don't use these prefix."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Why is it considered bad practice to use variables with names starting with single or double underscores in C and C++?\n\nA) Modern compilers get confused by underscore-prefixed variable names and may not compile the code correctly.\nB) It's an outdated convention from older programming practices and has no real impact on modern code.\nC) These prefixes are reserved by the C and C++ standards for implementation details and could potentially conflict with system-defined names.\nD) Underscore-prefixed variables are slower to access in memory, leading to decreased performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The C and C++ standards reserve variable names starting with single or double underscores for implementation details, such as those used in standard library implementations. Using these prefixes in your own code could potentially lead to conflicts with system-defined names, especially with macros, which might silently break your code. While most of the time using these prefixes might be safe, avoiding them provides a 100% guarantee that your naming won't conflict with implementation names.

This unexpected capture could have occurred because the dwarves were either knocked unconscious during combat or were sleeping when they entered the trapped area.
