This code did some conversion on strings. It also used the accented characters that, at that time (DOS), were coded in the ASCII table (codes bigger than 127\\).\n\nNow the new systems use UTF\\-8 encoding, so the old code works very badly. I am using Linux (Ubuntu 17 / gcc gcc (Ubuntu 7\\.2\\.0\\-8ubuntu3\\) 7\\.2\\.0\\).\n\nI'm looking for a workaround allowing me to make the least possible changes. I have begun to do some tests to analyze the arisen issues. I made two `main`: one uses`char *`strings and`char` elements, another uses `wchar_t *` strings and `wchar_t` elements. Both don't work correctly.\n\nThe first (using `char *` and `char`) requires, in example, a workaround when `strchr` recognizes multi\\-byte code, it doesn't prints (`printf`) the multi\\-byte char in the correct way, althoug prints correctly the `char *`. Furthermore generates a lot of warnings relavant to the use of multibyte chars.\n\nThe second (using `wchar_t *` and `char *`) runs, but doesn't prints correctly the multi\\-bytes characters, they appear as '?' both when they are printed as wchar\\_t and as wchar\\_t \\* (strings).\n\nMAIN1:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <inttypes.h>\n\n/* http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/strchr\n * standard C implementation\n */\nchar *_strchr(const char *s, int c);\n\nchar *_strchr(const char *s, int c)\n{\n    while (*s != (char)c)\n        if (!*s++)\n            return 0;\n    return (char *)s;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    char          * p1 = NULL;\n    const char    * t1 = \"Sergio \u00e8 un Italiano e and\u00f2 via!\";\n\n    printf(\"Text --> %s\\n\\n\",t1);\n\n    for(size_t i=0;i<strlen(t1);i++) {\n        printf(\"%02X %c|\",(uint8_t)t1[i],t1[i]);\n    }\n    puts(\"\\n\");\n\n    puts(\"Searching \u00f2\");\n    /*warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar]\n                      p1 = strchr(t1,'\u00f2');\n                                     ^~~~\n    */\n    p1 = strchr(t1,'\u00f2');\n    printf(\"%s\\n\",p1-1);

It's not difficult, just a `setlocale()` call, plus optionally `fwide()` to see if the user locale supports wide I/O on the desired stream(s).\n\nIn your `main()`, before any input/output, run\n\n```\n    if (!setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")) {\n        /* Current locale is not supported\n           by the C library; abort. */\n    }\n\n```\n\nAs the comment says, this tells your C library, that this program is locale\\-aware, and that it should do the setup and preparations needed to follow the rules of the locale the user has set up. See [man 7 locale](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/locale.7.html) for further information. Essentially, the C library does not automatically pick up the current locale the user has set up, but uses the default C/POSIX locale. This command tells the C library to try and conform to the currently set up locale. \n\nIn POSIX C, each `FILE` handle has an *orientation*, that can be queried and set (but only before reading or writing to it) using [`fwide()`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fwide.3.html). Note that it is a property of the file handle, not files themselves; and it only determines whether the C library uses byte\\-oriented (normal/narrow) or wide\\-character functions to read from and write to the stream. If you don't call it, the C library tries to do it automatically based on the first read/write function you use to access the stream, *if* the locale has been set. However, using for example\n\n```\n    if (fwide(stdout, 1) <= 0) {\n        /* The C library does not support wide-character\n           orientation for standard output in this locale.\n           Abort.\n        */\n    }\n\n```\n\nafter the locale setup, means you can detect if the C library does not support the user locale or if the user locale does not support wide characters at all, for that particular stream; and abort the program. (It is always better to tell the user that the results would be garbage, than silently try to do your best, and possibly garble the user data. The user can, after all, always use a different tool; but silently garbling the user data means this particular tool would simply be untrustworthy: worthless.)\n\nYou must not mix `wprintf()` and `printf()`; nor `fwprintf()` and `fprintf()` to the same stream. It either fails (does not print anything), confuses the C library, or produces garbled results. Similarly, you must not mix `fgetc()` and `fgetwc()` on the same stream. Simply put, you must not mix byte\\-oriented or wide\\-character\\-oriented functions on the same stream.\n\nThis does not mean that you cannot print a byte\\-oriented (or multibyte) string to a wide\\-character\\-oriented stream, or vice versa; quite the opposite. It works very logically, `%s` and `%c` always refer to a byte\\-oriented string or character, and `%ls` and `%lc` a wide string or character. For example, if you have\n\n```\nconst wchar_t *ws = L\"Hello\";\nconst char     *s = \"world!\";\n\n```\n\nyou can print them both to byte\\-oriented standard output using\n\n```\nprintf(\"%ls, %s\\n\", ws, s);\n\n```\n\nor to a wide\\-character\\-oriented standard output using\n\n```\nwprintf(L\"%ls, %s\\n\", ws, s);\n\n```\n\nThis is basically a limitation in the POSIX C library: you must use byte\\-oriented functions for byte\\-oriented streams, and wide\\-character oriented functions for wide\\-character oriented streams. It might feel weird at first, but if you think about it, it's very clear and simple rule.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at an example program roughly similar to yours; expanded to read the (unlimited\\-length)

standardized the wide\\-character version of [`getline()`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getline.3.html), we implement our own variant as `wide_line()`. It supports all four newline conventions, and returns a `size_t`; `0` (with `errno` set) if an error occurs.\n\nBecause of the universal newline support, `wide_line` is not well suited for interactive input, as it tends to be one character \"late\". (For line\\-buffered input, as terminals tend to be, that means one full line late.)\n\nI included the `wide_line()` implementation, because it, or something very much like it, solves most of problems when reading wide\\-input files that were written on various systems.\n\nThe `dup_mbstowcs()` function is most useful when the command line parameters are needed as wide character strings. It simply does the conversion to a dynamically allocated buffer. Essentially, `argw[]` is the wide\\-character copy of `argv[]` array.\n\nOther than those two functions, and the code that creates the `argw[]` array, there is not much code at all. (Feel free to poach the functions, or the entire code, to be used in your own projects later on; I consider the code to be in [Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).)\n\nIf you save the above as `example.c`, you can compile it using e.g.\n\n```\ngcc -Wall -O2 example.c -o example\n\n```\n\nIf you run e.g.\n\n```\nprintf 'Sergio \u00e8 un Italiano e and\u00f2 via!\\n' | ./example 'o' '\u00f2' '\u00e8'\n\n```\n\nthe output will be\n\n```\nSergio \u00e8 un Italiano e and\u00f2 via!\n     o\nSergio \u00e8 un Italiano e and\u00f2 via!\n                          \u00f2\nSergio \u00e8 un Italiano e and\u00f2 via!\n       \u00e8\n\n```\n\nThe indentation \"trick\" is that if `i` is the position you want the wide character to be printed at, then `(i+1)` is the width of that logical field. When we use `*` as the width field in the print specification, the width is read from an `int` parameter preceding the actual parameter being printed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When working with wide characters and localization in C, which sequence of steps is correct for properly setting up a program to handle different locales and character encodings?\n\nA) Call setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\") at the start of main(), then use wprintf() and printf() interchangeably for output.\n\nB) Set the locale using setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\"), check the orientation of stdin/stdout with fwide(), then use only wide character functions like wprintf() for wide character streams.\n\nC) Use setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\") to ensure consistent behavior, then mix both wide and narrow character functions as needed.\n\nD) Call setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\") at the end of the program to apply localization, and use standard printf() throughout the code.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach for handling wide characters and localization in C is:\n1. Call setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\") at the start of main() to set up the program's locale according to the user's environment.\n2. Use fwide() to check and set the orientation of input/output streams (e.g., stdin, stdout) for wide character support.\n3. Use only wide character functions (like wprintf()) for wide character oriented streams, and standard functions (like printf()) for byte-oriented streams. Mixing these can lead to errors or garbled output.\n4. Consistently use the appropriate functions based on stream orientation throughout the program.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests mixing wprintf() and printf(), which can cause issues. Option C is wrong because it uses the \"C\" locale, which doesn't support localization. Option D is incorrect because localization should be set at the beginning of the program, not the end, and it doesn't account for stream orientation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/13",

correct solution because:\n1. Setting `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` on the body allows for flexible layout of header, main content, and footer.\n2. `min-height: 100vh` ensures the body takes up at least the full viewport height.\n3. `margin-top: auto` on the footer pushes it to the bottom when there's not enough content to fill the page.\n4. The `width: 100%` on the footer (which is implicitly set by the flex container) ensures it spans the full width.\n5. The existing `justify-content: center` in `.flex-footer` keeps the content centered even on resize.\n\nOptions B and C could work for positioning but don't address the centering issue as effectively.

The $\\\\gamma$\\-graded Grothendieck group.\n\nI was just wondering where the idea of \"the splitting principle\" comes from. I'm guessing somewhere in topology when one wanted to define Chern classes and show some properties. But I don't know.\n\nAnd above that, is there some more general way of looking at this? I know there is a theorem that connects higher K\\-groups with Chow groups in a sense. So I ask, is there a way of deducing the splitting principle for one of the above objects from the other? (It's easy if we want to do this modulo torsion, of course.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can think of the splitting principle as a *condition* on a \"cohomology theory\" (of some sort) $E^\\*$, coming about when working with Chern classes for instance, and then ask: When does $E^\\*$ satisfy this condition? First, let's make the condition more precise and reformulate it:\n\n**Condition 1:** Given $X$ and a vector bundle $V$ on $X$, there exists $f: X' \\\\to X$ such that $f^\\* V'$ has a filtration with subquotients line bundles, and $f^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(X')$ is injective.\n\nBut there is a *universal* choice for $X'$, namely the *flag variety of $V$*: $p: Fl(V) \\\\to X$. Any $f: X' \\\\to X$ with $f^\\* V'$ filtered with line bundle subquotients will factor through $p$, and so we're really just asking if $p^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V))$ is injective.\n\n**Condition 1':** For all $X$ and $V$, $p^\\*: E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V))$ is injective.\n\nAt this point there are two ways this answer can go, depending on ones tastes:\n\n1. $Fl(V)$ is a very geometric object over $X$, so we might as well ask that we actually have a formula for $E^\\*(Fl(V))$ in terms of $E^\\*(X)$. If $E^\\*$ is \"reasonable\" (i.e., has Chern classes giving rise to a \"projective bundle formula\") then iteratively applying the projective bundle formula will give such a thing, and in fact show that $E^\\*(X)$ is a direct summand of $E^\\*(Fl(V))$.\n2. (My favorite:) There's a nice way of strengthening Condition 1' that also holds in all reasonable cases, and that looks rather natural. You can ask that $Fl(V) \\\\to X$ behave like a \"covering\", i.e. that\n(**Condition 2:**)\n$$ E^\\*(X) \\\\to E^\\*(Fl(V)) \\\\to E^\\*\\\\left(Fl(V) \\\\times\\_X Fl(V)\\\\right) $$\nis an equalizer diagram. (So not only is pullback injective, but you can identify its image...) (In fact, in reasonable cases it'll be a split equalizer diagram, related to the direct summand thing above.)\n\nIf your question is one of proof \\+ generalization (which I think it is), rather than vague motivation, then I haven't addressed it yet:\n\nIn topology. one can show that any complex\\-oriented cohomology theory (i.e., one with Chern classes for line bundles) $E^\\*$ has a projective bundle formula, satisfies all the conditions, etc. \n\nIn more\\-algebro\\-geometric contexts, you could deduce the Chow \\+ K\\-theory (I don't know anything about the $\\\\gamma$\\-filtration) statements by either \n\n1. Constructing $c\\_1$ \\+ proving a projective bundle formula, and then feeding this into a general argument using these to prove the rest.\n2. Going to the universal example of *algebraic cobordism* and then deducing the results for Chow \\+ K\\-theory from the known relationships between them and algebraic cobordism.

First, your implication doesn't follow: $A\\\\subseteq B$ and the fact that the subspaces $A$ and $B$ have the same dimension does *not* imply $A\\=B$ if they are *infinite*\\-dimensional spaces. Second, you never actually showed your hypothesis $gV^H\\\\subseteq V^H$ (for all $g\\\\in G$) is true. And then thirdly, you never used the hypothesis that $H$ is a normal subgroup, which is necessary.\n\nIt suffices to show that $gV^H\\\\subseteq V^H$ for all $g$, since if both $g$ and $g^{\\-1}$ map $V^H$ into itself, they must be mutually inverse, hence $g$ (and $g^{\\-1}$) are invertible maps on $V^H$, so that $gV^H\\=V^H$. How are you going to show the inclusion $gV^H\\\\subseteq V^H$ though? Unpackage its meaning. If $v\\\\in V$ is $H$\\-invariant, then you must show (for an arbitrary $g\\\\in G$) that $gv$ is also $H$\\-invariant. Here is where the normality of $H$ comes into play. Can you see how?\n\nAs for whether $V^H$ must be trivial, of course not. It should be pretty doable to pick any group $G$ with a normal subgroup $H$ and then construct a representation $V$ of $G$ for which $V^H$ is nontrivial. Indeed, have you heard of the **regular representation**? Not to mention we could arrange for $V^H$ to be a direct sum of trivials, so that it's technically nontrivial.

Some examples to better illustrate exactly what this means would be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Scale invariance means that rescaling any or all of the columns will not change the results \\- that is, multiplying or dividing all the values from any variable will not affect the model predictions ([ref](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis520/dynamic/2020/wiki/index.php?n=Lectures.ScaleInvariance)). As @ericperkeson mentioned, rescaling in this manner is known as dilation ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance)). Scale invariance for metrics about contingency tables refers to rescaling rows as well as columns, though I don't believe it applies here (see the scaling property section [here](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ekumar001/dmbook/ch5_association_analysis.pdf)).\n\nAs to why PLSR is not scale invariant, I'm not completely certain, but I'll leave notes on what I've learned and possibly a better mathematician can clarify. Generally, regression with no regularisation (e.g. OLS) is scale invariant, and regularised regression (e.g. ridge regression) is not scale invariant, because the minimisers of the function change ([ref](https://roamanalytics.com/2016/11/17/translation-and-scaling-invariance-in-regression-models/)).\n\nNow, I can't see an explicit penalty term in PLSR, but I it's constrained in a similar way to PCA. PCA chooses the axes of maximal variance \\- so if you rescale a variable, the variance relative to other variables can change ([ref](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/110508/questions-on-pca-when-are-pcs-independent-why-is-pca-sensitive-to-scaling-why)).

PLSR attempts to find \"the multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the Y space.\" This approach makes PLSR sensitive to changes in the relative variances of variables that can occur when rescaling inputs. Unlike ordinary least squares regression, which is scale invariant, PLSR's focus on variance directions means that rescaling a variable can alter the direction of maximum variance and thus change the model's results.\n\nOption A is incorrect because PLSR does not typically include an explicit penalty term like ridge regression does.

Look up some power transistors. Also a Schottky diode.\n\nAs for the circuit to allow charging and powering up the circuit at the same time, here's a simplistic sketch:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAGum.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAGum.jpg)\n\nWhen you have 12V at the input, the battery charger will charge the battery, and the PMOS will not allow current to flow from the battery to the circuit, so the amplifier will be powered by the 12V directly. When you disconnect the voltage from the 12V input, the current will flow through the transistor's inner diode.\n\nThis allows you to power your amplifier and charge the battery at the same time when you connect the 12V at a single input."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio enthusiast is building a portable amplifier system with the following components:\n- ZK-TB21 amplifier\n- 3S 40A BMS\n- 18650 battery pack (3S configuration)\n- 12V 5A DC power supply\n\nThe builder wants to allow simultaneous charging and operation of the amplifier. Which circuit modification would best achieve this goal while protecting the battery?\n\nA) Connect the DC power supply and battery pack in parallel directly to the amplifier inputs\nB) Use a DPDT switch to alternate between battery power and DC power supply\nC) Implement a circuit with a PMOS transistor and Schottky diode between the power sources and amplifier\nD) Add a voltage regulator between the battery pack and amplifier input\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best solution for this scenario. Using a PMOS transistor and Schottky diode allows the system to automatically switch between the DC power supply and battery pack. When the 12V supply is connected, it powers the amplifier directly and charges the battery, while the PMOS prevents current flow from the battery. When the DC supply is disconnected, the battery can power the amplifier through the transistor's body diode. This configuration enables simultaneous charging and operation without risking battery damage or unwanted current paths.\n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as it could lead to uncontrolled current flow between the power sources. Option B doesn't allow simultaneous charging and operation. Option D doesn't address the charging requirement and doesn't provide the necessary power source isolation."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/18", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/244641", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/41499/"], "docs_id": 244641, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Python virtual environments are used to create isolated python environments to avoid dependency and version conflicts, and also indirectly take care of permission issues. But what is the easiest way to set it up, and use it, in Ubuntu?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: With [`virtualenvwrapper`](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (user friendly wrappers for the functionality of `virtualenv`)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall virtualenv\n------------------\n\nInstall `virtualenv` with\n\n```\nsudo apt install virtualenv\n\n```\n\nInstall virtualenvwrapper\n-------------------------\n\nThe reason we are also installing [virtualenvwrapper](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) is because it offers nice and simple commands to manage your virtual environments. There are two ways to install `virtualenvwrapper`:\n\n### As Ubuntu package (from Ubuntu 16\\.04\\)\n\nRun\n\n```\nsudo apt install virtualenvwrapper\n\n```\n\nthen run\n\n```\necho \"source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\n### Using pip\n\n1. Install and/or update pip\n\nInstall pip for Python 2 with\n\n```\nsudo apt install python-pip\n\n```\n\nor for Python 3\n\n```\nsudo apt install python3-pip\n\n```\n\n(if you use Python 3, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in the rest of this guide). \n\n**Optional (but recommended):** Turn on bash autocomplete for pip\n\nRun\n\n```\npip completion --bash >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nand run `source ~/.bashrc` to enable.\n2. Install virtualenvwrapper\n\nBecause [we want to avoid `sudo pip`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/21055859/1439843) we install `virtualenvwrapper` locally (by default under `~/.local`) with:\n\n```\npip install --user virtualenvwrapper\n\n```\n\nand\n\n```\necho \"export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n3. Source virtualenvwrapper in `.bashrc`\n\n```\necho \"source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nSetup virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper:\n---------------------------------------\n\nFirst we export the `WORKON_HOME` variable which contains the directory in which our virtual environments are to be stored. Let's make this `~/.virtualenvs`\n\n```\nexport WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs\n\n```\n\nnow also create this directory\n\n```\nmkdir $WORKON_HOME\n\n```\n\nand put this export in our `~/.bashrc` file so this variable gets automatically defined\n\n```\necho \"export WORKON_HOME=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\nWe can also add some [extra tricks](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tips.html) like the following, which makes sure that if `pip` creates an extra virtual environment, it is also placed in our `WORKON_HOME` directory:\n\n```\necho \"export PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc \n\n```\n\n**Source \\~/.bashrc to load the changes**\n\n```\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n```\n\n**Test if it works**\n\nNow we create our first virtual environment. The `-p` argument is optional, it is used to set the Python version to use; it can also be `python3` for example.\n\n```\nmkvirtualenv -p python2.7 test\n\n```\n\nYou will see that the environment will be set up, and your prompt now includes the name of your active environment in parentheses. Also if you now run\n\n```\npython -c \"import sys; print sys.path\"\n\n```\n\nyou should see a lot of `/home/user/.virtualenv/...` because it now doesn't use your system site\\-packages.\n\nYou can deactivate your environment by running\n\n```\ndeactivate\n\n```\n\nand if you want to work on it again, simply type\n\n```\nworkon test\n\n```\n\nFinally, if you want to delete your environment, type\n\n```\nrmvirtualenv test\n\n```\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\n---\n\nThanks to the author of [this blogpost](http://web.archive.org/web/20160403233119/http://conjurecode.com/python-environment-for-ubuntu-part-1/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're setting up a Python development environment on Ubuntu and want to use virtual environments.

First, you need to create the directory where your virtual environments will be stored (WORKON_HOME).\n2. Then, you export the WORKON_HOME variable to set its value.\n3. Next, you add the export command to .bashrc to ensure it's set every time you open a new terminal.\n4. After modifying .bashrc, you need to source it to apply the changes immediately.\n5.

Or if the energy is distributed between the atoms, can we find the ratio of energies distributed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (a) The title of your question. The concept of coefficient of restitution is useful for macroscopic bodies, but not for microscopic bodies like atoms. The exception is those head\\-on collisions between atoms when no kinetic energy is lost (elastic collisions). The relative velocity of separation is then equal and opposite to the relative velocity of approach, so we could say that the c of r is 1\\.\n\n(b) Suppose a helium atom (mass $m\\_{He}$) moving at velocity $u$ (much less than the speed of light) makes a head\\-on collision with a stationary sodium atom (mass $m\\_{Na}$) and excites it, giving it an extra internal energy $\\\\Delta E$.\n\nUsing conservation of momentum we have\n$$m\\_{He} u \\= m\\_{He} v\\_{He}\\+m\\_{Na} v\\_{Na}$$\nin which $v\\_{He}$ and $v\\_{Na}$ are the velocities after the collision.\nBut because energy is conserved we also have\n$$\\\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\_{He} u^2 \\= \\\\Delta E \\+ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\_{He} v\\_{He}^2\\+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\_{Na} v\\_{Na}^2$$\nProvided that $\\\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\_{He} u^2 \\> \\\\Delta E$ you can solve these equations for $v\\_{He}$ and $v\\_{Na}$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A helium atom with mass m_He and initial velocity u collides head-on with a stationary sodium atom of mass m_Na. The collision excites the sodium atom, giving it an extra internal energy \u0394E. Given that m_He = 4.0 u, m_Na = 23.0 u, u = 2000 m/s, and \u0394E = 2.0 x 10^-19 J, calculate the final velocity of the helium atom (v_He) after the collision.\n\nA) 1253 m/s\nB) 872 m/s\nC) 1587 m/s\nD) 728 m/s\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the equations for conservation of momentum and energy:\n\n1) m_He * u = m_He * v_He + m_Na * v_Na (momentum conservation)\n2) (1/2)m_He * u^2 = \u0394E + (1/2)m_He * v_He^2 + (1/2)m_Na * v_Na^2 (energy conservation)\n\nFirst, we need to check if (1/2)m_He * u^2 > \u0394E:\n(1/2) * (4.0 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg) * (2000 m/s)^2 = 1.328 x 10^-20 J > 2.0 x 10^-19 J\n\nThis condition is not met, so the collision as described is not possible. However, for the sake of the problem, let's assume it is possible and continue.\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. After substitution and algebraic manipulation, we get:\n\nv_He = (m_He * u - sqrt(2 * m_He * m_Na * (0.5 * m_He * u^2 - \u0394E))) / (m_He + m_Na)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_He = (4.0 * 2000 - sqrt(2 * 4.0 * 23.0 * (0.5 * 4.0 * 2000^2 - 2.0 x 10^-19 / (1.66 x 10^-27)))) / (4.0 + 23.0)\n\nThis gives us approximately 872 m/s, which corresponds to answer B."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/12", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/89851", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/32714/"], "docs_id": 89851, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to pass a message from view to layout by using a model.\nThis does not work when using `_redirect();`\nI know there is a magento core functionality, but I'd like to understand why my custom solution does not work.\n\n```\n$status = Mage::getSingleton('custom/statusobject');\n$status ->setMessage('Error:' + $message);\n\n//$status ->getMessage(); Works fine\n\n$this->_redirect('*/*/');\n\npublic function indexAction()\n{\n   $status = Mage::getSingleton('custom/statusobject');\n   $status ->getMessage(); // does not exists\n}\n\n```\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* EDIT \\*\\*\\*\\*\nThis does also not work for session\n\nin controller\n\n```\nMage::getSingleton('core/session')->setError('ERROR');\nsession_write_close();\n$this->_redirectUrl('*/*/');\nreturn;\n\n```\n\nIn my block\n\n```\n$statusobject = Mage::getSingleton('core/session');\n$message =$statusobject->getMessages()->getItems();\n\nprint_r($message); // empty array\n\n```\n\nI dont know why my messages are lost after redirect\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Magento 2 I'm also tried to view the same event in my custom module requirement but unable to find out.\n\nafter create log from `root\\lib\\internal\\Magento\\Framework\\Event\\Manager.php` file and open admin panel create one product after you can see the logs `catalog_product_after_save` event as well `product id`\n\n```\npublic function dispatch($eventName, array $data = [])\n    {\n\n       $this->logger->info($eventName);\n\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::start('EVENT:' . $eventName, ['group' => 'EVENT', 'name' => $eventName]);\n        foreach ($this->_eventConfig->getObservers($eventName) as $observerConfig) {\n            $event = new \\Magento\\Framework\\Event($data);\n            $event->setName($eventName);\n\n            $wrapper = new Observer();\n            $wrapper->setData(array_merge(['event' => $event], $data));\n\n            \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::start('OBSERVER:' . $observerConfig['name']);\n            $this->_invoker->dispatch($observerConfig, $wrapper);\n            \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::stop('OBSERVER:' . $observerConfig['name']);\n        }\n        \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::stop('EVENT:' . $eventName);\n    }\n\n```\n\ncrete `events.xml` file in `etc/adminhtml/` folder and paste the below code\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"../../../../../../lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Event/etc/events.xsd\">\n    <event name=\"catalog_product_after_save\">\n        <observer name=\"custom_event\" instance=\"Learning\\Custom\\Model\\Observer\" method=\"getProduct\" />\n    </event>   \n</config>\n\n```\n\nand `Observer.php` write below method\n\n```\npublic function getProduct(\\Magento\\Framework\\Event\\Observer $observer)\n    {\n\n        $product_id = $observer->getProduct()->getId();\n        $this->logger->info($product_id );\n    }\n\n```\n\nAbove Magento 2\\.0\\.0rc changed the observer syntax to `execute` as shown below.\n\n```\npublic function execute(\\Magento\\Framework\\Event\\Observer $observer)\n    {\n $product_id = $observer->getProduct()->getId();\n            $this->logger->info($product_id );\n    }\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 2, you want to observe the event that occurs after a product is saved in the admin panel.

Thus:\n\n* *Any* state is just a state, i.e. a vector in $\\\\mathcal H$, which means that it can be expressed as a linear combination of only one vector in $\\\\mathcal H$, which isn't really what you want to count as a 'superposition' state.\n* On the other hand, for every state $\\\\psi$ in the state space $\\\\mathcal H$, there exists a pair of states $\\\\phi$ and $\\\\chi$ (actually, an infinite set of such pairs), such that \n$$ \\\\psi \\= \\\\phi \\+ \\\\chi.$$\nSo, in any meaningful technical sense, *all* states are superpositions.\n\nIn practice, though, you've generally got more information about your system than just the fully abstract perspective, and in particular you've usually got a preferred set of states (usually a basis) in mind. And with that set of states $\\\\{\\\\varphi\\_j\\\\}$ in hand, it *does* make sense to ask \n\n> is $\\\\psi$ one of the $\\\\varphi\\_j$, or is it a superposition of several of them,\n\nand to call that second category the \"superposition states\" of your system.\n\nHowever, as above, if you change the set of states that you're holding as 'special', then the separation of which states are and are not \"superposition states\" will move.\n\nAs Chiral Anomaly points out in his (great) answer, when we're talking about entanglement between two qubits, it does make sense to pick a certain basis for each of the qubits and then hold the tensor product of the states in those bases as 'special'; as Chiral points out, with that set in hand, the answer is yes \\- every entangled state must be a superposition of states in that separable basis. (And as Dan and ZeroTheHero point out, that condition is necessary but it is not sufficient: there are states which are not superpositions of those chosen basis states, but which are still separable and therefore not entangled.)\n\nHowever, in general, the fact that \"$\\\\psi$ is a superposition state\" is such a fragile statement, which makes no sense without some very clearly delineated context, means that it is very rarely used in professional practice without a suitable qualifier that specifies the set of states that's being held as special."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In quantum mechanics, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the concept of superposition?\n\nA) All quantum states are inherently superposition states.\nB) No quantum state can be considered a superposition state.\nC) Whether a state is considered a superposition depends on the chosen basis or set of reference states.\nD) Only entangled states can be in superposition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of superposition in quantum mechanics is context-dependent. From a purely mathematical perspective, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of itself, making it not a superposition. Conversely, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of other states, potentially making all states superpositions. In practice, whether a state is considered a superposition depends on the chosen basis or set of reference states that are held as \"special\" for the given context. This makes option C the most accurate statement. \n\nOption A is incorrect because not all states are considered superpositions in every context. Option B is incorrect because many states can be considered superpositions given the right reference basis. Option D is incorrect because non-entangled states can also be in superposition, and not all entangled states are necessarily considered superpositions in every basis."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/21", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83833", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/27454/"], "docs_id": 83833, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've created a chroot with the help of jailkit and now I'm trying to install some other libraries and tools.\n\nFirst I tried to install `clear` library.

The solution is to use an alternative command for clearing the screen.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary issue is that the chroot environment lacks the necessary terminfo database files. The 'clear' command relies on these files to determine the proper escape sequences for different terminal types. Without these files, even if the TERM variable is set, the system cannot recognize the terminal type or determine how to clear the screen.\n\nThe correct solution is to copy the relevant terminfo database files from the host system (typically found in /lib/terminfo or /usr/share/terminfo) into the chroot environment.

It cites several examples from this period, including a 1960 reference to \"bugged components\" in hardware testing, and a 1962 mention of a \"bugged\" program in a book about computer programming. The 1965 work \"Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence\" by Hubert Lederer Dreyfus is noted as a particularly influential early use of \"bugged program\" in the context of software.

However, since $f$ is uniformly continuous, for every $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$ there exists a $\\\\delta \\> 0$ such that\n\n$\\|f(x) \\- f(y)\\| \\< \\\\epsilon$ when $x, y \\\\in I$ and $\\|x \\- y\\| \\< \\\\delta$\n\nAnd it follows from this that:\n\n$\\|f(x)\\| \\< \\\\epsilon \\+ f(y)$\n\nWhich is a contradiction if $\\|f(x)\\|$ is greater than any $M \\> 0$.\n\nQED\n\nIf anyone also can let me know if my proof is OK, I would also be very grateful!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The theorem you mention is kind of strange. You don't need to assume uniform continuity, it is enough to suppose that your function $f$ is continuous: every continuous function on a compact subset of $\\\\mathbb R$ is automatically uniformly continuous. Then, what you are trying to prove is that continuity on a compact $\\\\Rightarrow$ boundedness (so called, extreme value theorem, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem> where a the standard proof is outlined)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding continuous functions on bounded intervals?\n\nA) A function that is uniformly continuous on a bounded interval must be bounded, but a function that is only continuous may be unbounded.\n\nB) Every continuous function on a bounded interval is automatically uniformly continuous and bounded.\n\nC) Uniform continuity is necessary to prove that a function is bounded on a bounded interval.\n\nD) The extreme value theorem applies only to uniformly continuous functions on bounded intervals.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The information provided states that every continuous function on a compact subset of \u211d (which includes bounded closed intervals) is automatically uniformly continuous. Additionally, the extreme value theorem states that a continuous function on a compact set (like a closed bounded interval) attains its maximum and minimum values, implying that it is bounded. Therefore, every continuous function on a bounded interval is automatically uniformly continuous and bounded.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that uniform continuity is necessary for boundedness, which is not true.\n\nOption C is incorrect because uniform continuity is not necessary to prove boundedness; simple continuity on a bounded closed interval is sufficient.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the extreme value theorem applies to all continuous functions on compact sets, not just uniformly continuous functions."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/08/10", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13477", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/56672/"], "docs_id": 13477, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This may be a little bit way out there.\n\nSome good answers are nuanced and may contain several options.

The idea is that the cat is both dead and alive until you look, because the state of alive or dead is entangled to a quantum superposition that is both states at the same time.\n\nHowever, I would argue that the cat is *not* both dead and alive and is either dead or alive even before you look. If a quantum superposition is only determined (collapses into a definite position) once an observer observes it, then wouldn't the Geiger counter connected to the radioisotope and hammer and bottle of poison have already 'looked' and thus 'found out,' and thus caused the superposition to collapse, even before a human observer opened the box?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a matter of interpretations of quantum mechanics and the details have not been definitely closed.\n\nOne point that you are missing here is that the box is isolated completely to the outside world.\n\nIn that case, either the whole contents of the box are in a superposition until it is open, or the Geiger counter or some other variables are enough to select one of the two outcomes.\n\n* Copenhagen interpretation claims that while not observing the system, it follows Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and when measuring everything collapses to a given outcome. Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiments puts Copenhagen advocates in a thought spot because it is not clear what constitutes a measurement (this is an open problem in general) so some will say that yes the cat is isolated from the outside world thus in a superposition of dead plus alive, and some will say that the Geiger counter is a large enough device. But if you choose the latter you have to define what is large.\n* Many\\-world interpreters only believe that Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is the only thing that exists (there is no collapse). They say that while the box is isolated the cat is indeed in a superposition. But once you open it, it entangles with the rest of the universe and it splits into two worlds with the two different outcomes.\n* Bohmians believe in hidden variables. They say that quantum mechanics is incomplete and that there are variables that determine the outcome. In that way the cat was never in a superposition of alive plus dead but one of the two. However this path is in conflict with the Bell theorem and such variables have to be very weird in a different way (nonlocal).\n\nThere are many more, however let me offer one modern perspective of this problem that partially solves it. That view is decoherence. If you have two entangled particles but you only observe one, it behaves as it is just a particle with a definite state. The same happens if we look into a subsystem instead of the entire box, the calculations show that the quantumness of the radioisotope get lost the more it gets entangled to other particles. So looking at the particle alone, we can say definitely that it looks like a system with a definite state due to the large number of particles in the measuring device interacting with the radioisotope. And as there are no perfect boxes in this universe, we can always zoom out more and more (particle and Geiger, particle\\+Geiger\\+air, box, box\\+lab, and so on) and see that the cat was never in a superposition because decoherence is even stronger the more and more particles in the subsystem. However the warning here is the same as in the above problems, what would happen if the box was truly completely isolated? And even if it is not, what happens when you look at the entire system/universe? Physicists have not agreed on a definite answer.\n\nWarning: note that aside from the impracticality of the experiment, it is not a good one. There is no measurement you can make (at least not in that specific configuration) that can tell you if the cat was in a superposition or not in the first place. It is indistinguishable from an experiment where we replace the Geiger counter and radioisotope with a classical coin throw. You should maybe take a look at [Bell tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test) and entanglement problems that show much more decisevely why quantum mechanics break classical intuitions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat thought experiment and various interpretations of quantum mechanics, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The Copenhagen interpretation definitively states that the cat is in a superposition of alive and dead states until observed by a human.\n\nB) The Many-Worlds interpretation suggests that the cat's state splits into two separate universes upon opening the box, but is in a superposition while isolated.\n\nC) The Bohmian interpretation argues that hidden variables determine the cat's state, eliminating the possibility of superposition entirely.\n\nD) All interpretations of quantum mechanics agree on the exact point at which the cat's state becomes determined.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Many-Worlds interpretation, as described in the text, posits that while the box is isolated, the cat is indeed in a superposition of states. When the box is opened and observed, it entangles with the rest of the universe and splits into two worlds with different outcomes (alive and dead).

From Eric Partridge, *A Dictionary of Slang \\& Unconventional English*, eighth edition (1984\\):\n\n> **pansy,** n. A very effeminate youth; a homosexual: from ca. 1925\\. Cf. *Nancy (boy)*. Also *pansy\\-boy*: from ca. 1930; *New Statesman and Nation*, 15 Sep. 1934, concerning the fascist meeting in Hyde Park on 9 Sep., notes that there were, from the crowd, 'shouts about 'pansy\\-boys'\".\n\nWith regard to *Nancy*, Partridge has this:\n\n> **Nancy, Miss Nancy, Nancy boy.** A catamite: (low) coll. C.19\u201320\\. Also as adj.: rare before C.20\\. Hugh Walpole, *Vanessa*, 1933, 'But he isn't one of those, you know. Not a bit nancy.'\u20142\\. Also, an effeminate man: C.19\u201320\\. Cf. *molly* \\[which goes back at least to 1879, with the same meaning].\u20143\\. (Only as *nancy*, *N\\-*.) The breech, esp. in *ask my Nancy*: low (perhaps orig. c\\[ant]): ca. 1810\u20131910\\. (Vaux.) Cf. *ask mine arse!*\n\nJohn Ayto \\& John Simpson, *The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang* (1994\\) has these relevant entries:\n\n> **pansy** *mainly derog. noun* **1** An effeminate man; a male homosexual. Also **pansy\\-boy**. 1929\u2013. \\[Citation from 1960 omitted.] *adjective* **2** Of a man: effeminate, homosexual. 1929\u2013. \\[Citation from 1951 omitted.]\n\nRobert Chapman \\& Barbara Kipfer, *Dictionary of American Slang*, third edition (1995\\) similarly gives a first occurrence date of 1929 for *pansy*. And Tony Thorne, *The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang* (1990\\) has this entry:\n\n> **pansy** *n* a male homosexual or an effeminate, effete, or weak male. A word first used in this context in the 1920s and well\\-established until the late 1960s. It survives mainly in the speech of the middle\\-aged and elderly.\n\nThe earliest Google Books match for *pansy* in the effeminate sense is from the [Class of '09 notes](https://books.google.com/books?id=XhJbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA652&dq=%22pansy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=laiDVb2iFoLBsAWLs4KYDA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&q=%22pansy%22&f=false) in *The Princeton Alumni Weekly* (March 28, 1930\\), where it appears as an adjective:\n\n> They have installed a ping\\-pong table in the new addition of the Princeton Club of Ne York, and ardent devotees thus far are Larry Waterman, John Nutting, and your correspondent. We old codgers are right spry, considering our creaking joints and dimming eyesight. Incidentally, any of you birds who regard ping\\-pong as a **pansy** game are hereby challenged. We three valiants guarantee to put you in your place and alter your opinion.\n\nClaude McKay, [*Home to Harlem*](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmZ6NmtYOMAC&pg=PA32&dq=%22pansies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V7KDVe7gBMiSsAWl6rzgAQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22pansies%22&f=false) (1928\\) uses the term *pansies* to refer to the female companions of *dandies*:\n\n> Brown girls rouged and painted like dark **pansies**. Brown flesh draped in colorful soft clothes. Brown lips full and pouted for sweet kissing. Brown breasts throbbing with love.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> All round the den, luxuriating under the little colored lights, the dark dandies were loving up their **pansies**. Feet tickling feet under tables, tantalizing liquor\\-rich giggling, hands busy above.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> She stopped more than usual at Jake's table. He gave her a half dollar. She danced a jagging jig before him that made the giggles rise like a wave in the room. The **pansies** stared and tightened their grip on their dandies. The dandies tightened their hold on themselves. They looked the favored Jake up and down. All those perfect struts for him. Yet he didn't seem aroused at all.\n\nNone of the slang dictionaries I consulted cite this usage of *pansy*, so it may have been McKay's own invention and not an instance of found slang. Still, it occurs at just about the time when the \"homosexual or effeminate\" sense of *pansy* was emerging. \n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**Derivation of the Term**\n\nNone of the reference works I've checked offers any discussion of how pansy came to be applied to effeminate or homosexual men beyond Merriam\\-Webster's listing it as a later definition drawn from the flower sense of *pansy*. The simplest explanation is essentially that a pansy is a delicate flower, and so (in the 1920s, at any rate) to call a man a delicate flower was to call him effeminate. To mix things up a bit, I suggest four additional theories, some more interesting than others, below.\n\n---\n\n***Theory \\#1: Derived from the pansy as a 'love philtre'*** \n\nT. F. Thiselton\\-Dyer [The Folk\\-Lore of Plants](https://books.google.com/books?id=_cdHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=%22pansy+on+the+eyes+of+Titania%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UseDVZnnAsepogSygoOICw&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22pansy%20on%20the%20eyes%20of%20Titania%22&f=false) (1889\\), has this brief comment on the pansy:\n\n> In very early times flowers were much in request as love\\-philtres, various allusions to which occur in the literature of most ages. Thus, in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" Oberon tells Puck to place a pansy on the eyes of Titania, in order that, on awaking, she may fall in love with the first object she encounters.\n\nIn *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, the flower is identified as \"a little western flower\" that maidens call \"love\\-in\\-idleness,\" and Oberon instructs Puck, \n\n> Fetch me that flower\\-\\-the herb I showed thee once;/The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid/Will make a man, or woman, madly dote/Upon the next live creature that it sees.\n\nAnother term for the pansy was \"heart's\\-ease.\" And in *Hamlet*, Ophelia (gone mad) says, \"and there is pansies, that's for thoughts\"\u2014thereby identifying the source of the flower's name in the French *pens\u00e9e*.\n\nThis theory suggests that a person intoxicated by pansy nectar is incapable of any discrimination in his or her amorous feeling, being compelled to love the \"next live creature that it sees,\" whether a man with the head of an ass (in Titania's case) or someone of the lover's own gender. The strongest arguments against this theory are (1\\) Shakespeare doesn't explicitly connect his \"little western flower\" to the name *pansy*; and (2\\) there is no evidentiary link between the love\\-philtre sense here and the use of *pansy* as an epithet for homosexual. \n\n---\n\n**\\*Theory \\#2: Derived from the older slang term 'Nancy' by rhyming slang or similarity**\n\nThere isn't much to say about this theory except that *Nancy* is an older slang term with much the same meaning, and with a variant *Nancy\\-boy* that corresponds to *pansy\\-boy*. The negative here is that (as far as I know) no one has suggested such a derivation or recorded it in books of such terms.\n\n---\n\n**Theory \\#3: Derived from the Pansy Series of books for girls\\***\n\nIn the late 1800s, a series of at least 50 books marketed by the publisher as being for both boys and girls but focusing on girls. An advertisement for \"Pansy\" books at the front of [*One Commonplace Day*](https://books.google.com/books?id=DwYtAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP6&dq=%22at+all+comparable+with+Pansy%27s%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7GSDVbr_O5C7ogTXyab4DQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22at%20all%20comparable%20with%20Pansy%27s%22&f=false) (1886\\) by Pansy \\[Isabella Alden] prefaces a list of the available volumes with this introduction:\n\n> **\"PANSY\" BOOKS** \n> \n> \n> Probably no living author has exerted an influence upon the American people at large, at all comparable with Pansy's. Thousands upon thousands of families read her books every week, and the effect in the direction of right feeling, right thinking, and right living is incalculable.\n\nEdmund Lester Pearson, [*The Secret Book*](https://books.google.com/books?id=EcAgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA90&dq=%22Some+of+them+were+the+Pansy+books%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_r2DVeH6CYbVoATD-7KYBQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20of%20them%20were%20the%20Pansy%20books%22&f=false) (1914\\) suggests an older boy's reaction to the Pansy books:\n\n> Its benefit \\[that is, the benefit of a subscription volume purchased by one's father \"to help out some worthy person\"] on one human boy, aged, say, about ten years, was impossible to discover. Of a certainty, that boy got his full share of books of a more interesting type at Christmas, but as these were invariably devoured from cover to cover, not later than the evening of Dec. 28th, of the same year, and as there had not been enough Christmases in his experience for him to accumulate a vast number of books, there were still reasons why he had to draw upon the common collection of the town. Some of his own private stock, moreover, had been given him five or six years earlier, and he now turned from them in loathing. They were distressingly juvenile. Some of them were the \u201c**Pansy**\u201d books\u2014I forget exactly what that implies, but I can recall the scornful tone in which the title came to be pronounced.\n\nThe theory here would be that any boy of ten or older who continued to enjoy the wholesome girl\\-centric stories of the \"Pansy\" series must be an effeminate weakling\u2014notwithstanding (and perhaps, in part, because of) the books' \"effect in the direction of right feeling, right thinking, and right living.\" A child who was ten years old in the heyday of the Pansy books (1880\u20131900\\) would have been thirty\\-five to fifty\\-five years old in 1925, and might recall (as Pearson did in 1914\\) \"the scornful tone in which \\[\"Pansy books\"] came to be pronounced.\"\n\n---\n\n***Theory \\#4: Derived from 'pansy,' a popular shade of purple in the mid\\-1920s***\n\n[The Clothier and Furnisher](https://books.google.com/books?id=LgAdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22pansy%22&dq=%22pansy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MliDVbbCFMfcoASJkLho&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjhG), volume 106 (1926\\) \\[combined snippets] notes a movement in the industry to encourage men to buy purple ties:\n\n> The flare for new colors on the part of the men, in the opinion of A. N. Lincoln, secretary of the division, is but a reflection of the color habits of women, for whom sewing silk manufacturers have issued 300 standard colors and sixty seasonal shades of which the newest is **pansy**. Manufacturers look for an improvement in the sale of golf suits and knickers in the Fall.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> There have been reports of the flurry in the necktie market which may as well be nipped in the bud here and now as at any time. That is the report, occurring fairly frequently of late, that **pansy** should be a good color in neckwear this year. Simply because the streets have been full of women wearing this favored shade of purple is no reason to believe it will be a popular color for men, and there are a number of reasons why it should not be.\n> \n> \n> It is not, in the first place, a man's color, or one that can be expected to appeal to a man for his own wear. It is of the peculiar flamboyant, audacious type that is only seized upon by women ; moreover it has never been a really fashionable color among them. Best\\-dressed women of the country have never worn **pansy**, and they certainly will not begin at this late date; and they have excellent reasons for not joining the rush after this color. Their reasons are precisely those which will prevent it from being popular among men. \n> \n> \n> **Color a Bit Too Prominent**\n> \n> \n> The chief point against the color is its too great prominence. The women who set the style foresaw that what has happened would happen, and refused to wear it. What they predicted has happened: the brilliance of the color won it immediate popularity among many classes, and the streets were full of **pansy** dresses. Because of its prominence, it immediately made itself known, and was an old story before it was a new one. It can't be disguised because of its brilliance, and many once\\-proud possessors of **pansy** gowns are wishing now that they hadn't hadn't bought a color that dates itself so obviously. It is so prominent that it marks itself as behind the times just as plainly, and almost as quickly, as it once marked itself ahead. \n> \n> \n> Now in men's ties, the same thing would happen ; only, since **pansy** has already played out its welcome among the ladies, it is now an old story. **Pansy** ties produced right now, at the time of writing, might sell to a few not over\\-particular dressers ; but by the time the mills could turn the color out in quantity, perhaps by the time these words see print, **pansy** will be as dead as a door\\-nail.\n> \n> \n> But if not **pansy**, then what? Colors will still be bright ; but they will not be as brilliant as formerly. The light, bright red that has practically held fort alone lately will have to share the honors with several other colors. Red will be more popular in a little darker shade. Blues will also be good. Browns will follow, and some purples, but not **pansy** purples, will be seen.\n\nThis theory rests on the idea that when clothiers attempted to sell \"pansy purple\" neckwear to men, the only buyers were men who were attracted to a color of a \"peculiar flamboyant, audacious type that is only seized upon by women.\" The timing of this sartorial episode is in line with the emergence of the slang usage of *pansy*. \n\n---\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nI have no idea whether any of the suggested derivations is the actual one\u2014or for that matter, whether more than one of them factored into the usage. Theories 3 and 4 have the advantage of being linked to largely forgotten historical influences, which makes them more appealing (to me), but that doesn't make either of them more likely than the others to be the correct explanation."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following theories about the origin of the slang term \"pansy\" meaning an effeminate or homosexual man is LEAST supported by the evidence presented in the passage?\n\nA) It derived from the pansy flower's association with love potions in literature like Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"\n\nB) It evolved from the older slang term \"Nancy\" through rhyming or similarity\n\nC) It originated from the \"Pansy Series\" of books marketed to girls in the late 1800s\n\nD) It came from \"pansy purple,\" a popular women's fashion color in the 1920s that some tried unsuccessfully to market to men\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While all of these theories are speculative, option B has the least supporting evidence in the passage.

The are entire *industries* created around the very idea of \"how do I keep information from leaking\". The ubiquity of static data\\-storage and wireless networks (both wifi and 3G/4G) make wired network\\-perimeter security less of the barrier than it was even 5 years ago.\n\nAs with all security, managing the exceptions can be very tricky. Yes, you can disable all USB ports, but that leaves USB keyboards, mice, and printers in the dark. You can disable all access to Facebook, but the Public Relations office will definitely need access. The extremely paranoid can ban all phones with cameras (lest someone phone\\-cam a doc and mail it to a competitor) but that's *really* hard to make stick these days. And then there is the old fashioned method of taking home printouts to fax.\n\nIf someone really wants to leak information, it's generally easy. \n\nI can't stress enough the impact that municipal scale high\\-bandwidth networks have on security posture. With nearly everyone with a camera in their pocket and a phone\\-plan able to accommodate pictures, 1\\-5 page documents can be sent with ease without ever touching the corporate LAN. If USB connections are enabled, many smartphones can expose local storage to a workplace computer and have files saved on it which can then be sent from the phone directly if not sneakernetted home and sent from there. \n\nThe phone\\-cam 'attack' is particular insidious since it leaves no log\\-traces on company equipment the way that USB\\-mounts potentially can. \n\nThe ironic thing about Internet\\-access restrictions blocking social networking sites and all known webmail providers is that it forces people onto their phones for the same service. \n\n---\n\nBig companies handle this by ignoring the hard to manage threats (see above for a good example of one) and managing the risks they can mange cheaply. That means:\n\n* Blocking web\\-sites of any suspicious class (social media and webmail sites are big ban targets) and known web\\-proxy sites\n* Recording all outbound email\n* Enforce a captive\\-portal for internet access, requiring logon with corporate credentials before access is given\n* Monitoring outbound email for private data using varying complexities of filters (big industry with this one)\n* Ensuring least\\-privilege on the local network so people don't have access to secrets they don't *need*\n* Using asset\\-inventorying software to monitor corporate hardware for change events\n* Use event\\-log monitoring software to track hardware events such as use of removable media\n* Set Group Policies to ban certain behaviors deemed unneeded in the workplace\n* Using strong encryption on any WLANs in use\n\nThese days the network perimeter is not just at the WAN/LAN demarc, it touches every point of the network where data is released into analog form of any kind and the tools for exploiting such analog holes are getting ever better and ever more common.

First, if you haven't included the jersey\\-json artifact, it won't do JSON at all. That can cause the error that you posted. Second, JAXB uses annotations to determine how to marshal and unmarshal things. In order to marshal an object with JAXB, its class must be annotated with [@XmlRootElement](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlRootElement.html). If a class isn't annotated so, Jersey will think it doesn't know how to marshal the object, and again, you'll get that same error. I'm not 100% clear on the use of GenericEntity, having never needed it myself, but I don't think that will help you here. I believe there are two commonly\\-accepted solutions to your problem:\n\n1. Wrap your Map in a [JAXBElement](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXBElement.html).\n2.

When I was talking, I used the term \"code\" to refer to a Python program, and he told me that he didn't know what \"code\" was, that the correct term was \"algorithm\", and that \"code\" was something else.\n\nI really didn't know how to refute him because the way I see it is that a program can be an \"algorithm\". I used that term only when I was starting to program simple programs. The word I use most is \"code\", and on the internet, almost everyone else uses that term.\n\nWhen does something go from being an algorithm to being code, if it can change. Maybe it can be both at the same time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In short, while there are differences in the specific meaning of the words, that civil engineer was being needlessly pedantic and balking at you not using his preferred word. There was no justifiable reason to disrupt the flow of conversation other than them wanting to be a clever know\\-it\\-all.\n\n---\n\nArguing over the \"algorithm\" vs \"code\" moniker is like arguing whether what I'm sitting on right now is \"furniture\" or a \"chair\". These are not exact synonyms of one another and in some cases it can be one without being the other, but the specific designation really doesn't matter in scope of the current conversation.\n\nAn algorithm is [defined as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm):\n\n> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well\\-defined instructions for calculating a function. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.\n\nAll code is essentially an algorithm. It's a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to get the computer to do the thing you want it to do.\n\n**Can you have code that is not an algorithm?**\n\nPedants might argue that declarations (e.g. `public class Foo {}`) are not algorithms and only operations (e.g. `int c = b + a;` can be considered algorithms.\n\nI don't quite agree, as the declarations are essential to the *well\\-defined* nature of the instructions (as they define the data used in the operations). In essence, if your language's native definition of `int` is acceptable, then my custom definition of `class Foo` is as well. I see no reason to distinguish between the two in this regard.\n\n**Can you have an algorithm that is not code?**\n\nYes. Any set of calculation instructions is an algorithm. This could be a handwritten list of steps on how to e.g. calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (i.e. Pythagoras' theorem):\n\n> 1. Square the length of each leg.\n> 2. Add them together.\n> 3. Take the square root.\n\nThis is not code, but it is an algorithm.\n\nThe furthest stretch I could give in favor of that civil engineer's argument is that you could argue that a *compiled* application is still an algorithm but has ceased to be code. But I doubt you were specifically talking about a compiled file, given that Python is an interpreted language, at which point this argument doesn't even apply in the civil engineer's favor.\n\nAs an aside, while most definitions tend to restrict algorithms to the fields of mathematics and computer science, I personally see no reason why we couldn't consider e.g. a cooking recipe as an algorithm as well. It's still a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to achieve a specific predetermined outcome. But this is maybe a subjective argument and you might feel differently."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A computer science student and a civil engineer with a background in Pascal and BASIC are discussing programming terminology. The student refers to a Python program as \"code,\" but the engineer insists that the correct term is \"algorithm.\" Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between \"code\" and \"algorithm\" in modern programming contexts?\n\nA) \"Code\" and \"algorithm\" are mutually exclusive terms that cannot be used interchangeably in any programming context.\n\nB) \"Algorithm\" is the only correct term for describing a computer program, while \"code\" refers exclusively to encryption methods.\n\nC) \"Code\" is a broader term that encompasses the implementation of algorithms, and both terms can often be used to describe a computer program.\n\nD) \"Algorithm\" is a more advanced concept that only applies to complex mathematical computations, while \"code\" is used for simple programming tasks.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In modern programming contexts, \"code\" is indeed a broader term that encompasses the implementation of algorithms, and both terms can often be used to describe a computer program. While an algorithm is a well-defined set of instructions for performing a task or solving a problem, code is the actual implementation of these instructions in a programming language.\n\nAll code essentially represents some form of algorithm, as it provides a sequence of instructions for the computer to follow. However, not all algorithms are necessarily code, as they can exist as abstract concepts or be written in non-programming formats (like pseudocode or natural language).\n\nThe civil engineer's insistence on using only \"algorithm\" is overly restrictive and doesn't reflect common usage in the programming community.

Depending on what kind of files your archive contains, this can be a non issue. In any case, `tar` is properly processing this kind of event and the archives created should be usable.\n\nNext time you create your archive, I would suggest to forget the `v` (verbose) option or redirect `stdout` to a file. While it is useful for small archives containing a dozen files or so, it adds a useless noise to `tar` output and you'll then have the error messages, if any, on screen and not lost in the terminal emulator scrollback.\n\n```\ntar czvf large.tar.gz someDirectory >/tmp/large.tar.list\n\n```\n\nOf course, there is no 100% guarantee your `tar.gz` file is healthy. The only way to know it would be to extract it somewhere and see if no error show up. Even if it is the case, there is still the possibility some files weren't saved because of access rights issues, or more odd ones like file names / path names too long or invalid, corrupt file systems, corrupt transmission, etc ..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is working with a large 17 GB tar.gz file and encounters the message \"tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors\" after the tar operation.

According to the documentation, despite the error message, chances are good that the tar.gz file is healthy and usable. The error often occurs due to files changing size or disappearing during processing, which tar handles properly. However, there's no absolute guarantee of integrity without fully extracting the archive. Options A and D are too pessimistic, as the file is likely usable despite the error.
