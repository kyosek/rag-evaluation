I understand intuitively, the stick will have linear and angular momentum, and that it will spin around its center of mass. \n\nBut why must the mass rotate around its center of mass? Why couldn't the stick simply move horizontally to the right (along with the ball) and not spin at all since the stick's center of mass isn't pinned to anything? It seems like there exists an imaginary pin at the center of mass causing it to rotate around that point regardless of where the ball hit.\n\nAnd my second question is can the point of reference be chosen at a point other than the center of mass (but still be on the stick), and calculate the torque about that point and still be able to calculate the stick's motion after collision? I've thought about picking the point the ball collides with the stick as the point of reference. Then by the definition of torque, the torque will be $0$, which implies there will be no rotation at all? Why is this reasoning incorrect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I get that work is essentially a measure of whether a force is\n>  \u201csuccessful\u201d or not in displacing an object in its direction.\n\n\"Successful\" has no meaning in connection with the definition of work. In its most basic form, work is one of the two basic means of energy transfer between objects, and is the result of the dot product of force times displacement. The other means of energy transfer is heat, which is energy transfer due solely to temperature difference, as you will learn in Thermodynamics.\n\n> And, that if said force is successful, the velocity of the object must\n>  change in response and gain kinetic energy.\n\nWork on an object does not necessarily result in a change in kinetic energy of an object. It is ***net*** work done on an object that results in a change in kinetic energy. The governing principle is the work\\-energy theorem which states that the *net* work done on an object results in a change in kinetic energy.\n\nAn example where work doesn't necessarily result in a change in kinetic energy is work done against mechanical kinetic friction. \n\nSay you apply a constant force pushing a box at constant velocity on a surface with friction. You do positive work on the box giving it energy since the direction of your force is in the same direction as the displacement of the box. But since the box is moving at constant velocity, the work you do doesn't change the kinetic energy of the box. This is because at the same time the friction force that opposes you is doing an equal amount of negative work since its force is in the opposite direction to the displacement. The net work done on the box is zero and there is no change in kinetic energy. What happened to the energy you gave the box? Friction took it away raising the temperatures of contacting surfaces increasing the internal energy of the box and surface (a.k.a friction heating).\n\n> I think that kinetic energy is just the ability to influence another\n>  object\u2019s acceleration by motion. But here\u2019s the thing. These\n>  definitions are completely reliant on the assumption that the \u201cequals\u201d\n>  sign in the Work\\-Energy Theorem makes both sides of the equation an\n>  \u201cif then, then that\u201d statement.\n\nI'm afraid I don't follow you here. But insofar as the \"influence\" of kinetic energy is concerned, work can certainly result in the transfer of kinetic energy from one object to another. As far as a \"sign in the work energy theorem\" is concerned, net work can result in either a positive or negative change in kinetic energy. If you bring an object to a stop over a distance \"d\", the force you apply is opposite the direction of the displacement of the object you bring to a stop. From the work energy theorem\n\n$$W\\_{net}\\=F\\_{ave}d\\=\\\\frac{mv\\_{f}^2}{2}\\-\\\\frac{mv\\_{i}^2}{2}$$\n\nwhere $f$ and $i$ indicate the final and initial velocity of the object, $d$ is the stopping distance, and $F\\_{ave}$ is the average force exerted over the stopping distance. Since the final velocity is zero, the work done brining the object to a stop is negative. Negative work means the work has taken energy away from the object.\n\n> The closest I have come in this case is that energy is simply work yet\n>  to be done, but I still have no way of knowing if my intuition is\n>  correct or not from the equation. I was able to define force and\n>  momentum without relying on prior definitions, but with this, I\u2019ve hit\n>  a roadblock. And that roadblock begs the question in the title.\n\nPerhaps my responses to your previous statements clarifies this. But with regard to the title of your post, the definitions of fundamental terms don't come from the work energy theorem. It's the reverse. The work\\-energy theorem comes from the definition of work and Newton's second law. Not the other way around.\n\nHope this helps."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A 2 kg box is pushed horizontally across a rough surface for 5 meters by a constant force of 10 N.

They only need the (log density function of the) prior distribution and the (log\\-)likelihood. The product of these two (or the sum, when working on the log\\-scale) is only proportional to the posterior (we lack a normalizing constant). Being able to work with that may not sound like a huge bit of progress, but actually helps a lot, because we can usually not find the necessary normalizing constant analytically. In contrast, it is often pretty easy to write down the log\\-likelihood and the log density of the prior distribution. That (either conditional on some parameters for Gibbs sampling, or unconditionally for e.g. Metropolis\\-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) is enough to put MCMC samplers to work."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which of the following statements is correct regarding how samplers like JAGS, WinBUGS, or Stan calculate the posterior distribution?\n\nA) They directly calculate the full posterior distribution before sampling from it.\nB) They only require the prior distribution and likelihood function to sample from the posterior.\nC) They need to analytically solve for the normalizing constant of the posterior distribution.\nD) They use a predefined posterior function stored in their internal libraries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. MCMC samplers like JAGS, WinBUGS, and Stan do not need to calculate the full posterior distribution directly. Instead, they work with the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function, which is proportional to the posterior. This approach allows them to sample from the posterior without needing to calculate the normalizing constant, which is often analytically intractable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because these samplers do not directly calculate the full posterior distribution before sampling.\n\nOption C is incorrect because one of the key advantages of MCMC methods is that they don't need to solve for the normalizing constant analytically.\n\nOption D is incorrect as these samplers don't rely on predefined posterior functions but rather construct the posterior based on the user-specified model, prior, and likelihood.\n\nThe ability to work with just the prior and likelihood, without needing the exact posterior, is what makes these MCMC methods powerful and widely applicable in Bayesian inference."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/13", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/71398", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/11747/"], "docs_id": 71398, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that `.DS_store` files serve a purpose.

The documentation states that \"An engine specifically designed to deliver more torque would like be more efficient than the two combined.\" This suggests that a purpose-built high-torque engine could outperform two standard engines in terms of efficiency when towing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation doesn't definitively state that two independent cars are always more efficient.\n\nOption C is contradicted by the Audi Quattro example, which showed that distributing torque across all four wheels resulted in the lowest rolling resistance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation specifically states to \"assume the second is far enough back to not get any draft,\" meaning wind resistance would be the same for both vehicles."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/57563", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/16986/"], "docs_id": 57563, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For me the Agent Analyst tool interface won't open. \n\nI have ArcGIS 10\\.1 sp1 installed on my computer. \n\nI have followed these steps so far:\n\n1. added the refresh.config.exe text file ([ArcGIS 10\\.1 using Repast's Agent Analyst Extension \\- refresh.exe does not work](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48655/arcgis-10-1-using-repasts-agent-analyst-extension-refresh-exe-does-not-work))\n2. changed values 10\\.0 to 10\\.1 in files agent\\_analyst.bat and agent\\_analyst\\_run.bat in agent analyst installation folder\n3\\- added the ArcGIS 10\\.1 installation path \"for example C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.1\" to environment variables ARC\\_JAVA \\& ARC\\_JAVAW \\& ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR ([Which GIS software or plugins can perform a Cellular Automata Simulation?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/44285/which-gis-software-or-plugins-can-perform-a-cellular-automata-simulation/44291#44291))\n\nI restarted and still have had no luck (just a black box flashes up when I create a new agent analyst tool or try to edit the tool). \n\nIs there some other step I need to do or have I done one of the above steps incorrectly? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I also got Agent Analyst to work with ArcGIS 10\\.2 (at least so far). I had to perform the steps noted above, but given that it was a bit confusing with some of the responses I will summarize here:\n\n1. Create **Refresh.exe.config** file with a text editor and save it along with **Refresh.exe** (typically in **C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst\\\\Refresh**). The **Refresh.exe.config** contents will be identical to the contents of the configuration file described here (\"Update 2\"): [ArcGIS 10\\.1 using Repast's Agent Analyst Extension \\- refresh.exe does not work](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48655/arcgis-10-1-using-repasts-agent-analyst-extension-refresh-exe-does-not-work) but you must replace newVersion\\=\"10\\.1\\.0\\.0\" with newVersion\\=\"10\\.2\\.0\\.0\".\n2. As noted above, edit the **agent\\_analyst.bat** and **agent\\_analyst\\_run.bat** files in the installation folder (**C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst**) so that the folder paths contain Desktop10\\.2 in the folder path strings: \n\n```\nrem set ARC_JAVA=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\jre\\bin\\java\"\nrem set ARC_JAVAW=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\jre\\bin\\javaw\"\nrem set ARCOBJECTS_JAR=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\java\\lib\\arcobjects.jar\"\n\n```\n3. Then, edit your Environment Variables to make sure that ARC\\_JAVA, ARC\\_JAVAW, and ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR have a fully specified path entered for each variable (like what is in the .bat files above).\n4. Then, in my Environment Variables, I had to move ARC\\_JAVA (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\jre\\\\bin\\\\java**), ARC\\_JAVAW (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\jre\\\\bin\\\\javaw**), ARCOBJECTS\\_JAR (**C:\\\\Program Files (x86\\)\\\\ArcGIS\\\\Desktop10\\.2\\\\java\\\\lib\\\\arcobjects.jar**), AGENT\\_ANALYST (**C:\\\\Repast 3\\\\Agent Analyst**), and AGENT\\_ANALYST\\_VOL (**C:**) from my User Variables to my System Variables. Depending on your situation, I foresee that some people may not need to do this. If you install software and manage your system with a separate ADMIN account, then I think you will need to do this...I had to do so to get it to work.\n5. Finally, make sure you restart your system and open a fresh ArcGIS session...\n\nI'm new to Agent Analyst so I don't know if there will be other issues down the road, but now I am at least able to see the Agent Analyst user interface when adding a new tool so it appears that everything is working well so far."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're trying to set up Agent Analyst with ArcGIS 10.2, but the interface won't open.

The above\\-linked cord protector looks reasonably thin, so I don't think it'd be too noticeable if stepped on through the new thick padding and thick carpet I will soon be getting.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You'll end up with two lumps in the carpet that can't be easily removed. You'll also have holes in your carpet at each side for the wire. So unless you're going for the college dorm look, I'd recommend against this. If you do it anyway, the only way to get the wire through this is to attach it to the existing wire and use that to pull it through. I doubt the magnet idea would ever work, and trying to push the wire through would just fold on itself since it's not rigid enough.\n\nAs for the way I would do it, the easy way is to pick up a box of [nail clips](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202698897/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) and tack the wire down around the baseboard. With these, you can pull the nail slightly and spin the clip 180 degrees to easily add or remove a wire behind it. After enough time and especially enough furniture, you tend to forget they are even there. You can also have a nicer look with some [wall mounted conduit](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202562905/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053).\n\nThe excessive option is to open up the floor or below ceiling and run [flexible conduit](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202316470/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053&superSkuId=202891061) through the floor, preferably with the ends in the wall behind [a modular plate](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100356860/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) with the appropriate [connectors](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100356844/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053) installed.

(yuck!)\n\nAny decent idea?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic idea is that you **do NOT check\\-in confidential values** in the code or in the compiled binary. Especially if the project is open source you really shouldn't. There are several configuration strategies you can take in order to do so:\n\nPlaceholders in code (hardcoded values)\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Placeholders in code** \\- as was suggested \\- which is most sane and easiest to do in dynamic programming languages as the code is easy to change (without needing to compile). I've seen a lot of open source projects do this such as MediaWiki with it's [`LocalSettings.php`](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual%3aLocalSettings.php).\n\nThe **downside with this strategy** is that the key is hardcoded. So if the program is distributed as a binary then having the key hard\\-coded does not make it particularly maintainable.\n\nConfiguration Text Files\n------------------------\n\nYou can also do this by implementing **configuration text files**, i.e. the program/application searches for a configuration file and reads values from it. You can check\\-in a sample configuration with placeholders but have the actual configuration local in your machine. \n\nIn your case you can create a `key.conf` text file with the actual key, let the program use that file and let it be ignored by version control. You can, for being helpful, check in a `key.conf.example` text file with a bogus key and check that\\-in. Make sure your program/application makes an helpful error message \nfor the user to add the actual key in the correct file.\n\nSome programming languages have APIs that provide this automatically for you, such as:\n\n* Java's [Properties API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html), [Preferences API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/preferences.html), [Apache Commons Configuration API](http://commons.apache.org/configuration/)\n* C\\#/VB.NET apps does this with `App.Config` files accessible through the [ConfigurationManager .NET API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager.aspx)\n* NodeJS apps have a convention of `package.json` or putting configuration values in json\\-files, and with the [file modules API](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules) the files are easy to parse and use as they're basically [JavaScript object literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects).\n\nIf your application is a database app, then consider putting the key or other configuration variables in the database. It is the same as the configuration text file above but you put all configuration variables such as the key in a database table instead.\n\nThrough preferences view or a Back Office app\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf the program is a window or a web application with views then you can also let the application create the configuration file, through a preferences view of sorts. That way you don't need to check in an example config file as suggested above.\n\nMediaWiki solved this similarly by auto\\-generating the `LocalSettings.php` file in an initial installation process.\n\nAdmittedly this is not an option for programs that solely run as background processes, services or daemons. However that's why you create seperate GUI projects for these to create a point\\-of\\-entry for administration and preferences settings, in web apps usually called a *[Back Office application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_office_application)*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on an open-source project that needs to use a secret API key.

However, in constructive mathematics, there are multiple Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields, which are not provable to be equivalent to each other: one cannot in general prove that the Dedekind real numbers embeds into the initial Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field. (By Cauchy complete we mean complete by Cauchy sequences, not Cauchy nets.)\n\nThe principal square root function is a function defined on the non\\-negative elements $\\[0, \\\\infty)$ of a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field $\\\\mathbb{R}$ such that it is a two\\-sided inverse of the square function $x^2$ when $x^2$ is restricted on the domain and codomain to $\\[0, \\\\infty)$.\n\nIn classical mathematics, one could prove that the principal square root function exists by proving the fundamental theorem of algebra for any Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field. However, in constructive mathematics, the fundamental theorem of algebra cannot in general be proven for Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields.\n\nIn classical mathematics, there is an alternative to proving that the principal square root function exists: by first proving that zero has a square root, and that there exists a two\\-sided inverse function of $x^2$ on the positive elements $(0, \\\\infty)$ of $\\\\mathbb{R}$. The square root of zero is zero in any integral domain, and because in any Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field the square function $x^2$ is continuously differentiable on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$ and its derivative $2x$ is always positive on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$, by the inverse function theorem, there exists a two\\-sided inverse defined on $(0, \\\\infty)$. (In constructive mathematics, the inverse function theorem still holds for $x^2$ because $x^2$ is uniformly differentiable on every closed subinterval of $(0, \\\\infty)$. Then we use excluded middle to show that if the principal square root function is defined at $0$ and defined on the domain $(0, \\\\infty)$, then it is defined on $\\[0, \\\\infty)$. However, in constructive mathematics, by definition there is no excluded middle, so we cannot prove the last step.\n\nThe exponential function is defined by a particular Taylor series, and the logarithm function could be defined by an analytic continuation of a particular Taylor series. Thus, one could try to define the square root as the function\n$$e^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(x)}$$\nHowever, because $\\\\ln(x)$ is undefined at $x \\= 0$, that function is only defined on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$. Similarly to the previous attempt, in classical mathematics, one could use excluded middle to extend the function to $\\[0, \\\\infty)$, but that isn't possible in constructive mathematics.\n\nIs there a way of proving that the principal square root function on the non\\-negative elements of a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field actually exists? I might be missing something very obvious. Or is it not provable in constructive mathematics that such a function exists in all Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields?\n\nThis is fairly important because it is one of the functions used in defining the Euclidean metric in finite\\-dimensional vector spaces over Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields. If the latter is the case, then one might have to equip Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields with the additional structure of a principal square root function in order to do constructive Euclidean geometry.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think see how this is related to your other questions. These are not resolved last I checked, but the following will answer this question whichever way the other questions end up going.\n\nI believe the following are constructively equivalent for any notion of $\\\\mathbb R$ which is Cauchy complete assuming that unique choice is valid:\n\n1. There are lattice functions $\\\\min/\\\\max:\\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. There is an an absolute value function $\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\[0,\\\\infty)$.\n3. There is square root function $\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$.\n\nThe equivalence of 1 and 2 follows from these relations:\n$$\\|x\\| \\= \\\\max(x,\\-x), \\\\qquad \\\\max(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{x \\+ y \\+ \\|y \\- x\\|}{2}, \\\\qquad \\\\min(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{x \\+ y \\- \\|y \\- x\\|}{2}.$$\nThat 3 implies 2 follows from $\\|x\\| \\= \\\\sqrt{x^2}$.\n\nThe fun part is that 1 \\& 2 implies 3\\. As you have observed, there is a square root function $(0,\\\\infty)\\\\to(0,\\\\infty)$ by the Inverse Function Theorem.\n\nWith this apparatus, we can define continuous functions $f\\_n:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$:\n$$f\\_n(x) \\= \\\\begin{cases}\n1/2^n \\& \\\\text{when $0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1/4^n$} \\\\\\\\\n\\\\sqrt{x} \\& \\\\text{when $x \\\\geq 1/4^n$} \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{cases}$$\nAs stated, that requires knowing whether $x \\\\leq 1/4^n$ or $x \\\\geq 1/4^n$, but we can work around this by patching two functions together:\n\n* $f^{\\-}\\_n:\\[0,1/4^n)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ is the constant function with value $1/2^n$,\n* $f^{\\+}\\_n:(0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ is defined as $\\\\max(1/2^n,\\\\sqrt{x})$.\n\nSince these functions agree on their overlap, and their domains comprise all of $\\[0,\\\\infty)$ we do get a total function $f\\_n:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ as a result. (This is where unique choice is used.)\n\nNow the sequence of functions $(f\\_n)\\_{n\\=0}^\\\\infty$ so defined converges uniformly on any closed bounded interval to a continuous function $f:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$. It is easily seen that this is indeed the square\\-root function: $(f(x))^2 \\= x$ for all $x \\\\geq 0$.\n\n---\n\nIn the above, I discreetly used the fact that a uniformly Cauchy sequence $(f\\_n )^\\\\infty\\_{n\\=0}$ of continuous functions on a closed bounded interval converges to a continuous function on that interval. This is a straightforward consequence of Cauchy completeness and unique choice, so nothing to worry about... but it just occurred to me that this is enough to prove the existence of the absolute value function. To do this without circular reasoning, we need to pick a sequence $(f\\_n)\\_{n\\=0}^\\\\infty$ whose definition doesn't involve min/max, absolute values, square root. That takes some thought but I believe $f\\_n(x) \\= x\\\\tanh(n x)$ does the trick!\n\nSo it looks like all three statements above are equivalent because they are all true!\n\n---\n\nAs mentioned in the comments, there are two common notions of \"Cauchy complete\" used in constructive mathematics. The \"classical\" notion, in symbolic form, is:\n$$\\\\forall \\\\varepsilon \\> 0\\\\,\\\\exists N\\\\,\\\\forall m, n \\\\geq N\\\\,\\[\\-\\\\varepsilon \\< x\\_m \\- x\\_n \\< \\\\varepsilon]$$\n(I avoided the customary absolute value for good form.) The stricter notion requires a modulus of convergence $\\\\phi : \\\\mathbb N\\\\to\\\\mathbb N$ such that: $$\\\\forall m,n \\\\geq \\\\phi(N)\\\\,\\\\left\\[\\\\frac{\\-1}{2^N} \\< x\\_m \\- x\\_n \\< \\\\frac{1}{2^N}\\\\right]$$\nThere's a bunch of equivalent variations but you get the idea...\nThe latter is usually preferred by constructivists because of things like the [Specker sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specker_sequence).\n\nThe answer above is agnostic about this distinction since it is straightforward to supply the requisite modulus of convergence wherever Cauchy completeness is used."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In constructive mathematics, which of the following statements about Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields is correct?\n\nA) The principal square root function on non-negative elements can always be proven to exist using the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nB) The exponential and logarithm functions can be used to define the square root function for all non-negative real numbers, including zero.\n\nC) The existence of lattice functions (min/max) is constructively equivalent to the existence of an absolute value function and a square root function on non-negative elements.\n\nD) The inverse function theorem cannot be applied to the square function on the open interval (0, \u221e) in constructive mathematics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Apparently, Microsoft initiates restoration of each window as soon as the logon prompt is displayed, and checks to see that the screen real estate is there as it does so. When it wakes the monitors, there can be a delay before a monitor is detected by the OS, and Windows uses a default simulated monitor if there is no monitor detected yet. Microsoft likes this behavior, as it prevents loss of access to offscreen windows if you reduce the number of screens, especially after someone disconnects a projector from a laptop at the end of a meeting. \n\nThis delay in the monitor becoming visible to the system could also depend on how the monitor is attached to the system (VGA, HDMI, DVI or DisplayPort), and how the graphics adapter reports the monitor configuration during wake\\-up. With my setup (Radeon R9 260, LG monitors, primary on PowerPort, older, smaller one on HDMI) it seems like the monitor configuration isn't fully visible to Windows until the little monitor health windows both go away.\n\nI have found that I can avoid most moving and resizing if I am patient and careful about how I wake the system. \n\nThe problem seems to be that pressing a key or mouse button initiates both wake and logon in a single action. Even while logon initiation is waiting for you to enter a password or select a different user, it starts waking up the windows from the previous session to save time. Therefor it can be looking at the monitor configuration to make sure the window placement is valid before many monitors wake and become ready and visible to the system. \n\nThe trick is to separate wake from login initiation. One way is to use the computer power button to wake, assuming it is set to do that. One of my keyboards has a wake/sleep button, and that also works. \n\nThe way that I generally use is to move the mouse (an arrow key would also work) to start to wake the system up, and then wait for the monitor to fully wake before pressing any other key or the mouse button to get the logon prompt. My monitors display a little window of configuration info at startup, and if I wait until both of those have disappeared before I press a key or mouse button to get the login prompt, the windows generally come up where they belong. I wait to see the background wallpaper up without a login prompt until the monitor initiation is complete, and then click to bring up the logon prompt.\n\nIf I start by pressing the mouse button or any of the other keyboard keys, or if that has happened since the computer went to sleep even if I never logged on, it seems to initiate both wake and logon (displaying the default user and accepting the password) at the same time. This causes the system to start waking up windows, program by program, without being able to see the monitors, and they all end up in the top left of my primary monitor. Sometimes, say if I move the mouse but then press the button too fast, some programs (say, Excel and Bing) have their windows moved there, and others (Chrome and Word, maybe) have them still where they were. I think that tends to confirm my theories above of why this works.\n\nThere is also a tendency of some windows to migrate down and right a bit on wakeup; I don't see much of a solution to that except to extend the window to the bottom or right edge of the screen, or at least to near it (hitting the bottom in Win10 tends to extend the window vertically over both screens, in a top/bottom configuration)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for windows moving to the primary screen after waking up from sleep mode in a multi-monitor setup, according to the StackExchange answer?\n\nA) The graphics card drivers are incompatible with the operating system\nB) Windows initiates window restoration before all monitors are fully detected\nC) The secondary monitor's connection type (DVI or HDMI) is causing conflicts\nD) The user is pressing keys too quickly during the wake-up process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The StackExchange answer explains that Microsoft initiates the restoration of each window as soon as the logon prompt is displayed. During this process, Windows checks if the screen real estate is available. However, there can be a delay before all monitors are detected by the OS when waking up. If a monitor is not yet detected, Windows uses a default simulated monitor, which can cause windows to be moved to the primary screen.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the issue is not related to driver incompatibility, as the user mentioned reinstalling drivers didn't solve the problem.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the connection type (DVI or HDMI) is stated to not matter significantly in this context.\n\nAnswer D, while partially related to the issue, is not the primary reason for the window movement.

What is the most accurate statement about attempting to map \"localhost\" in the virtual machine to the host machine's IP address?\n\nA) Editing the hosts file in the virtual machine to map \"localhost\" to the host machine's IP address will work correctly.\n\nB) \"localhost\" can be remapped to any IP address by modifying system configuration files.\n\nC) \"localhost\" is always bound to 127.0.0.1 as per RFC 2606 and cannot be changed.\n\nD) Using Application Request Routing in IIS will allow \"localhost\" to refer to the host machine's IP address.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to RFC 2606, which defines reserved Top-Level Domains (TLDs), \"localhost\" is specifically prohibited from being remapped. TCP/IP stacks are designed to always statically bind \"localhost\" to the local loopback address (127.0.0.1). This means that attempts to change the mapping of \"localhost\" through configuration files or other means will not be successful. \n\nOption A is incorrect because editing the hosts file will not override the TCP/IP stack's handling of \"localhost\". \n\nOption B is false because \"localhost\" cannot be remapped due to the RFC 2606 specification. \n\nOption D, while mentioning a valid technology (Application Request Routing), does not actually change the meaning of \"localhost\" itself, but rather creates a proxy rule for routing requests, which doesn't address the core issue of remapping \"localhost\"."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/05", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/170143", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/214259/"], "docs_id": 170143, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I tried to select my country information in Careers 2\\.0, I surprisingly found that it shows **Taiwan province of China**.\n\nIt's not true, or not even close.\n\nI'm really unhappy to see this.

I am talking about these, including Java, ECMAScript, C\\# and Python (with `__str__(self)`defined). The same applies to other functions like `ceil()`, `floor()` etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose we're designing a new language and we want `Sqrt` to be an instance method. So we look at the `double` class and begin designing. It obviously has no inputs (other than the instance) and returns a `double`. We write and test the code. Perfection.\n\nBut taking the square root of an integer is valid, too, and we don't want to force everyone to convert to a double just to take a square root. So we move to `int` and start designing. What does it return? We *could* return an `int` and make it work only for perfect squares, or round the result to the nearest `int` (ignoring the debate about the proper rounding method for now). But what if someone wants a non\\-integer result? Should we have two methods \\- one that returns an `int` and one that returns a `double` (which is not possible in some languages without changing the name). So we decide that it should return a `double`. Now we implement. But the implementation is identical to the one we used for `double`. Do we copy\\-and\\-paste? Do we cast the instance to a `double` and call *that* instance method? Why not put the logic in a library method that can be accessed from both classes. We'll call the library `Math` and the function `Math.Sqrt`. \n\n> Why is `Math.Sqrt` a static function?:\n\n* Because the implementation is the same regardless of the underlying numeric type\n* Because it does not affect a particular instance (it takes in one value and returns a result)\n* Because numeric types do not *depend* on that functionality, therefore it makes sense to have it in a separate class\n\nWe haven't even addressed other arguments:\n\n* Should it be named `GetSqrt` since it *returns* a new value rather than modifying the instance?\n* What about `Square`? `Abs`? `Trunc`? `Log10`? `Ln`? `Power`? `Factorial`? `Sin`? `Cos`? `ArcTan`?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the discussion about static and instance methods for mathematical operations, which of the following statements best explains why Math.Sqrt() is typically implemented as a static method rather than an instance method?\n\nA) Instance methods are not capable of handling different numeric types, while static methods can work with both integers and floating-point numbers.\n\nB) Static methods in a Math library provide better performance than instance methods on numeric types.\n\nC) The implementation of Sqrt() is the same regardless of the numeric type, and it doesn't modify the instance, making it more suitable as a static method in a separate Math class.\n\nD) Instance methods on numeric types are not supported in most programming languages, necessitating the use of static methods for mathematical operations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the key points from the discussion. The implementation of Sqrt() is indeed the same for different numeric types (like int and double), and it doesn't modify the original value but returns a new one. This makes it more logical and efficient to implement as a static method in a separate Math class, rather than duplicating the logic across different numeric types as instance methods. \n\nOption A is incorrect because instance methods can handle different numeric types, but it's the consistency of implementation that's the key issue.

Option D is false, as many languages do support instance methods on numeric types (the question even mentions ToString() as an example)."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/27", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/147221", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/41799/"], "docs_id": 147221, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a problem with colors and lines in tables.\nI have this code:\n\n```\n\\usepackage{multirow}\n\\usepackage{colortbl}\n        \\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|c|c|c|c|}  \\cline{3-8} \\cline{3-8}\n         & & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\cellcolor{gray!25} Cram\u00e9r von Mises} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\cellcolor{gray!25} Anderson-Darling} \\\\  \\cline{3-8} \\cline{3-8}\n         & & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.1 & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.05  & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.01 & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.1 & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.05 & \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=$0.01 \\\\ \\hline\n        \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=25 & 0.106 & 0.063 & 0.015 & 0.107 & 0.052 & 0.012 \\\\ \n        \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=50 & 0.107 & 0.043 & 0.010 & 0.103 & 0.054 & 0.010 \\\\ \n        \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\multirow{3}{0.3cm}[7mm]{\\begin{sideways}$\\qquad$ $Exp(1)$ \\end{sideways}}}&\\cellcolor{gray!25} n=100 & 0.104 & 0.065 & 0.017 & 0.110 & 0.055 & 0.015 \\\\ \\hline\n        \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=25 & 0.113 & 0.055 & 0.014 & 0.097 & 0.058 & 0.016 \\\\ \n         \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=50 & 0.109 & 0.058 & 0.014 & 0.098 & 0.056 & 0.018 \\\\ \n         \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{ \\multirow{3}{0.3cm}[7mm]{\\begin{sideways}$\\qquad$ $Exp(2)$ \\end{sideways}}} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=100 & 0.110 & 0.048 & 0.011 & 0.108 & 0.044 & 0.009  \\\\ \\hline\n          \\end{tabular}\n\n```\n\nI need to color the multirow cell and the only thing I could arise was to color the lower part of it. \n\nMy other problem is when I coloured the cells, I cant see properly the rules of the table.\n\nI hope someone can help me.\n\nThanks!!!!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Always supply a complete, but minimal document. Yours is missing `\\documentclass` as well as `\\begin` and `\\end` document. It is also missing the loading of `xcolor` (for the color names like `gray!25`) and `rotating` (for the `sideways` environment). To color the whole multirow you need to color all three cells of it. Also, your use of `\\multirow` is incorrect. If you want to put the text into the cells above it, the number should be negative. If you do that, you don't need the optional adjustments of `[7mm]` nor the `\\qquad`s. I've done a few other things I think make the result better: Taking `Exp` out of math mode, putting the numbers after `\\alpha=` into math mode, removing some errant spaces, and removing most of the vertical lines:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{multirow,xcolor,colortbl,rotating}\n\\begin{document}\n\\noindent\\begin{tabular}{ll|cccccc|}  \\cline{3-8} \\cline{3-8}\n   &&\\multicolumn{3}{c} {\\cellcolor{gray!25} Cram\\'er von Mises}&\n     \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\cellcolor{gray!25} Anderson-Darling}\\\\\n  \\cline{3-8} \\cline{3-8}\n   &&\\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.1 $ &\\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.05$&\n     \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.01$ &\\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.1 $&\n     \\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.05$ &\\cellcolor{gray!25}$\\alpha=0.01$\\\\\n  \\hline\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=25 & 0.106 & \n    0.063 & 0.015 & 0.107 & 0.052 & 0.012 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=50 & 0.107 & \n    0.043 & 0.010 & 0.103 & 0.054 & 0.010 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}%\n    \\multirow{-3}{*}{\\begin{sideways}Exp$(1)$\\end{sideways}}}&\n    \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=100 & 0.104 & 0.065 & 0.017 & 0.110 & 0.055 & 0.015 \\\\\n  \\hline\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=25 & 0.113 &\n    0.055 & 0.014 & 0.097 & 0.058 & 0.016 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}} & \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=50 & 0.109 & \n    0.058 & 0.014 & 0.098 & 0.056 & 0.018 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{1}{|c}{\\cellcolor{gray!25}%\n    \\multirow{-3}{*}{\\begin{sideways}Exp$(2)$\\end{sideways}}}&\n    \\cellcolor{gray!25}n=100 & 0.110 & 0.048 & 0.011 & 0.108 & 0.044 & 0.009  \\\\\n  \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n(I've also broken the lines so people reading this don't have to scroll three screens over to see the whole code.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the LaTeX table code:\n\nQuestion: In the given LaTeX code for creating a complex table, which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of the \\multirow command?\n\nA) The \\multirow command is used correctly with a positive number to span multiple rows upwards.\n\nB) The \\multirow command should be used with a negative number to place text in the cells above it.\n\nC) The optional adjustment [7mm] is necessary for proper vertical alignment of the sideways text.\n\nD) The \\qquad command is required inside the \\multirow to properly space the sideways text.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The top answer suggests that \"The install shouldn't replace anything from the env.php if you don't tell it to.\" This implies that the installation process may be overwriting the env.php file, potentially causing the configuration issues leading to the blank page and subsequent error. \n\nWhile the other options (Redis configuration, session save method, and cache backend) are related to the content of the env.php file, they are less likely to be the root cause of the problem.
