We have a lot of templates that we use to create standard documents. When a document based on one of these templates is closed, the user is asked if they want to save changes to the template. I wrote a macro that prevents this, but only if the main document was saved just prior to closing. Is there a way to prevent the template from ever being saved/changed from a document that is based in it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I reviewed the link above and it lead me to the answer. I am creating the new documents with a macro that loads the proper template. i just added two lines to the macro:\n\n```\nActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.Saved=True\nActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate=\"\"\n\n```\n\nThe first line makes the template appear to be saved (so that user is not prompted). The second line breaks the connectioun to the template.

The problem is very simple, a ball with radius R is attached to a rope of length L. The pendulum is subject to gravity and oscillates in a plane. I used angular momentum to solve the problem. But when I consider the angular momentum w.r.t. the center of mass G, I get $\\\\vec L\\_G \\= \\\\tilde I\\_G \\\\vec \\\\omega$ and $\\\\frac{d\\\\vec L}{dt}\\= \\\\vec M\\_G\\=0$ since the vectors of the forces have their origin at G. However, it's clear that $\\\\omega$ is not constant. What's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAnd in general, when we calculate $\\\\vec L$ with respect to the center of mass, which is rotating, does the formula $\\\\vec L\\_G \\= \\\\tilde I\\_G \\\\vec \\\\omega$ still apply? Is $\\\\omega$ always the total angular velocity? Do I have to calculate the inertia tensor I with respect to a point on the axis of rotation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the ball is suspended from its centre of mass (CoM) then it does not rotate as it swings (diagram 1\\). The forces on it act through the CoM and there is no torque. The ball maintains the same orientation in space. This can be described as a **simple pendulum**.\n\nIn your case if the ball is rotating as it swings then as you deduce its angular momentum must be changing. This could happen if the string or rod is attached at the rim of the ball (diagram 2\\). Now it is possible for the ball to rotate around the point of attachment. As this happens the tension in the string or rod does not pass through the CoM of the ball. So there can be a varying torque on the ball which causes a rotation in space. This is a **compound pendulum**.\n\nAnother arrangement is to have the stiff rod attached at two points on the ball, instead of only one (diagram 3\\). Now the forces on the ball from the rod need not act through the same point, so a torque can be created which rotates the ball in space while it swings.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CNOm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CNOm.png)\n\nIn another arrangement a heavy ball could rest on the seat of a swing. It is impossible to set the swing oscillating like a pendulum without the ball rolling forward and backward on the seat. A varying torque is required to explain this motion.\n\nIf you account for the forces and torques on the ball correctly, the formula $L\\_G\\=I\\\\omega$ still applies but $\\\\dot L\\_G \\=M\\_G \\\\ne 0$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A ball of radius R is attached to a rope of length L to form a pendulum. The pendulum oscillates in a plane under the influence of gravity. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the angular momentum of the ball?\n\nA) The angular momentum of the ball with respect to its center of mass is always constant, regardless of how the rope is attached.\n\nB) If the rope is attached at the rim of the ball, the angular momentum of the ball with respect to its center of mass remains constant during oscillation.\n\nC) When the rope is attached at the center of mass of the ball, the ball will rotate about its own axis as it swings.\n\nD) If the rope is attached at the rim of the ball, there can be a varying torque on the ball causing its angular momentum with respect to the center of mass to change over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: When the rope is attached at the rim of the ball (as in a compound pendulum), the tension in the rope does not pass through the center of mass of the ball. This creates a varying torque on the ball as it swings, causing it to rotate in space. As a result, the angular momentum of the ball with respect to its center of mass changes over time. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the angular momentum can change depending on how the rope is attached. Option B is false because rim attachment leads to varying angular momentum. Option C is incorrect because when the rope is attached at the center of mass (simple pendulum), the ball maintains the same orientation in space without rotating about its own axis."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/09/13", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/82927", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/31102/"], "docs_id": 82927, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: While trying to install Magento 1\\.9 on my CentOS/APACHE server, when I open the `install.php` file in the browser, getting a blank page.\n\nI would want someone to help me through this please, stuck on it since hours now, and am not able to find a solution to that.\n\nFor the reference, here is the link: <http://www.bluetopink.com/magento/install.php>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: you can fix this with give the directories and files the right permission \n\nyou can use this:\n\n```\nfind . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nfind . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nchown APACHE_USER:APACHE_GROUP -R *\n\n```\n\nyou can find the name of apache user and group in `/etc/passwd`\n\nif the problem still doesn't solve,you can use [Magento Downloader](https://www.magentocommerce.com/download) that can helps you to see what should you install or do to run magento :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are trying to install Magento 1.9 on a CentOS/Apache server, but when you open the install.php file in the browser, you get a blank page.

So I post these questions.\n\n1. Is monthly data better than weekly data for forecasting?\n2. Can there be seasonality in weekly data? Most software/methods don't seem to find seasonality in forecasting data.\n3. Is there a way to aggregate weekly data to monthly data?\n4. How do methods like ARIMA/Exponential Smoothing handle seasonality with weekly data?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Better for what? If you want weekly forecasts, use weekly data. If you want monthly forecasts, use monthly data.\n2. Of course. Weekly data is often seasonal. If the software isn't modelling seasonality that is obviously there, then you are either using the wrong model or using the software incorrectly.\n3. No. There isn't an integer number of weeks per month, so there is no way to reliably split the weeks that overlap month boundaries. You could apportion the week according to the number of days which fall within each month, but that doesn't take account of day\\-of\\-week effects, and with weekly data there is no way of estimating day\\-of\\-week effects.\n4. Badly. See my blog post on this (<http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/>). There are several problems:\n\n\t* there are not an integer number of weeks in a year\n\t* exponential smoothing essentially has one parameter for each week\n\t* seasonal ARIMA models either difference away a whole year or more of data, or they regress on observations at least a year old.A better approach is to handle the seasonality using Fourier terms (as explained in my blog post). That can be done within an exponential smoothing framework (the TBATS model) or within an ARIMA framework (a regression with ARMA errors).

There is almost no modern CPU that doesn't have multiple cores, many have up to 8, and specialized machines for high\\-performance computing can easily have 64 across several sockets. Writing code in the obvious way, in a normal programming language, uses only *one* of those. In other words, it may use *less than 2%* of the available computing resources of the machine it's running on.\n* Using SIMD instructions (confusingly, this is also called \"vectorization\" but in a different sense than in the text quotes in the question). In essence, instead of 4 or 8 or so scalar arithmetic instructions, give the CPU *one* instruction that performs arithmetic on 4 or 8 or so registers in parallel. This can literally make some calculations (when they're a perfectly independent and fit for the instruction set) 4 or 8 times faster.\n* Making smarter [use of the cache](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16699247/395760). Memory access are faster if they are *temporally and spatially coherent*, that is, consecutive accesses are to nearby addresses and when accessing an address twice you access it twice in quick succession rather than with a long pause.\n* Using accelerators such as GPUs. These devices are very different beasts from CPUs and programming them efficiently is an whole art form of its own. For example, they have hundreds of cores, which are grouped into groups of a few dozen cores, and these groups share resources \u2014 they share a few KiB of memory that is much faster than normal memory, and when any core of the group executes an `if` statement all the others in that group have to wait for it.\n* [Distribute the work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) over several machines (very important in supercomputers!) which introduces a huge set of new headaches but can, of course, give access to vastly greater computing resources.\n* Smarter algorithms. For matrix multiplication the simple O(n^3\\) algorithm, properly optimized with the tricks above, are often faster than [the sub\\-cubic ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm#Sub-cubic_algorithms) for reasonable matrix sizes, but sometimes they win. For special cases such as sparse matrices, you can write specialized algorithms.\n\nA lot of smart people have written very [efficient code for common linear algebra operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS), using the above tricks and many more and usually even with stupid platform\\-specific tricks. Therefore, transforming your formula into a matrix multiplication *and then implementing that calculation by calling into a mature linear algebra library* benefits from that optimization effort. By contrast, if you simply write the formula out in the obvious way in a high\\-level language, the machine code that is eventually generated won't use all of those tricks and won't be as fast. This is also true if you take the matrix formulation and implement it by calling a naive matrix multiplication routine that you wrote yourself (again, in the obvious way).\n\nMaking code fast *takes work*, and often quite a lot of work if you want that last ounce of performance. Because so many important calculations can be expressed as combination of a couple of linear algebra operations, it's economical to create highly optimized code for these operations. Your one\\-off specialized use case, though? Nobody cares about that except you, so optimizing the heck out of it is not economical."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a reason why expressing calculations as matrix multiplications can lead to performance improvements in software?\n\nA) Matrix calculations can more easily utilize multiple CPU cores for parallel processing.\nB) Matrix operations can take advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.\nC) Matrix multiplications always use sub-cubic algorithms, which are faster than the standard O(n^3) algorithm.\nD) Matrix operations can make better use of CPU cache due to spatial and temporal coherence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: Matrix calculations can be parallelized across multiple CPU cores, improving performance.\nB is correct: SIMD instructions can perform operations on multiple data points simultaneously, which is well-suited for matrix operations.\nC is incorrect: While sub-cubic algorithms exist for matrix multiplication, they are not always faster than the standard O(n^3) algorithm, especially for matrices of reasonable size.

If no Bloodrazor, what would be another option for her against targets with much HP ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Why you shouldn't use Madred's Bloodrazor on Riven:\n\n* Riven scales badly with bonus attack speed, because she should aim to attack only after every ability use. This means not only bonus attack speed from Razor is wasted, but also you won't be using Razor efficiently, since the item procs *do* scale with attackspeed.\n* Riven has no magical attacks, and thus has no need to use Magic Penetration/Reduction. Which means Razor procs will hit enemies full Magic Resistance, making the item even worse.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\n* Stack AD. Riven has great AD scaling, and you can always use more of it. Remember that it also makes your shield stronger!\n* Stack Lifesteal. Since Riven's passive\\-boost on autoattacks counts for lifesteal, this can make enormous difference, especially in 1v1\\. Also, lifesteal scales with the AD you're already stacking. Stacking Bloodthirsters can be legitimate tactic on Riven.

The documentation emphasizes that Riven scales excellently with AD and benefits greatly from lifesteal. Stacking Bloodthirsters provides both high AD and lifesteal, which synergizes well with Riven's kit and playstyle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Madred's Bloodrazor is not efficient on Riven. She doesn't benefit from the attack speed, and the magic damage proc is less effective due to her lack of magic penetration.\n\nOption C is wrong because Riven doesn't scale well with attack speed. She's designed to weave auto-attacks between abilities rather than relying on rapid attacks.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Riven has no AP scalings, making AP items inefficient on her.\n\nThe correct strategy involves stacking AD and lifesteal, using items like Bloodthirster, while also considering some armor penetration items like Last Whisper for dealing with tanky opponents."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/29", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11263396", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/616363/"], "docs_id": 11263396, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: we use VS 2008\n\nthere is a big enum, which is populated by many developers\n\nthis enum has a type \\_\\_int64 (a Microsoft extension), and I want to make compiler complain about non unique values in enum.\n\nif it was a usual enum I would do like this:\n\n```\nenum E1\n{\n    E11 = 0x01F00,\n    E12 = 0x01F00,\n    E13\n};\n#pragma warning(push)\n#pragma warning(error: 4061)\n#pragma warning(error: 4062)\nvoid F(E1 e1)\n{\n    switch (e1)\n    {\n    case E11:\n    case E12:\n    case E13:\n        return;\n    }\n}\n#pragma warning(pop)\n\n```\n\nand the function F would have an error, if E1 has 2 same values\n\nand it would have another error, if a developer forgot to add a new value to switch\n\nbut my enum has type \\_\\_int64 (or long long)\n\nand when I try do the same switch for E1 e1 it truncates values and complains on values, wich difference is either 0x100000000, or 0x200000000 ....\n\nif I cast e1 to \\_\\_int64, the compiler does not complain, if a developer forgets to add a new value to the switch (so the whole check function becomes useless)\n\nthe question: does someone know what I can do about it? or maybe VS 2008 (or C\\+\\+) has another instrument to ensure enum : \\_\\_int64 has only unique values?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From your comment I'll assume that you don't have aggregate (combined) flags within the enum itself.

It will have different bugs from the main MySQL releases, which users will be reliant on Amazon to fix. A distributed transactional database backend is a complex thing to write, and while Amazon have some of the best engineers in the world for this sort of system, it's still quite new.\n\nIt relies on a completely new Amazon\\-specific multi\\-tenanted storage backend, and the updated software isn't freely available as open source, so you can't just download it and run it on your own servers. It may diverge over time (e.g. years) in terms of functional features supported, meaning that code developed against Aurora may no longer work against mainstream MySQL releases, providing a risk of increased lock\\-in to Amazon.\n\nRegardless, especially if your application needs them, the performance, low replica lag, scalability and recovery time reductions over standard MySQL look pretty compelling in the short term.

Like the previous person said, people should take the time to read this: [http://www.w3\\.org/TR/css3\\-mediaqueries/](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)\n\n**Now**, here is an answer. You can put \"landscape\" or \"portrait\" in conjunction with widths and heights in your @media rules. This assumes that height is greater than the width and vice versa. I usually only use min\\-width and then have a few separate @media rules for those specifically. One example would be landscape: horizontal scroll (desktop) and portrait: regular vertical (tablet/phone )\n\nThose 2 wouldn't do it alone though, you'll need some combinations. I think we can assume your sidebar would be a hindrance on screens smaller than 600px wide.\n\n```\n/* 01 */\n@media (min-width: 0) {\n   /* this is the same as not using a media query... */\n   .main-content {\n     width: 100%;\n     float: left;\n   }\n\n   .side-bar {\n     width: 100%;\n     float: left\n   }\n\n}\n\n/* 2 */\n@media (min-width: 600px) and (orientation:landscape) {\n\n   .main-content {\n     width: 70%;\n     float: left;\n   }\n\n   .side-bar {\n     width: 30%;\n     float: left\n   }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n[HERE is a jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/sheriffderek/JNK54/) \\- note that box\\-sizing: border\\-box; is used for padding issues.\n\n2017 UPDATE\n-----------\n\nI think most people would use flexbox now: <https://jsfiddle.net/sheriffderek/egxcgyyd/>\n\n```\n.parent {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) and (orientation:landscape) {\n  .parent {\n    flex-direction: row;\n  }\n  .child-1 {\n    min-width: 260px; /* or flex-basis: xx - try them both */\n  }\n  .child-2 {\n    flex-basis: 100%; /* \"if at all possible... please try to be this size...\" */\n  }\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to create a responsive layout that changes based on the screen orientation and width.

However, the default setting on the 13\\-inch MacBooks is 1440x900@2x (making the UI slightly larger for better accessibility). What the MacBook is supposed to do:\n\n1. Render screen at 2880x1800 (to create 1440x900@2x)\n2. Scale down to 2560x1600\n\nIt seems your MacBook failed to do step 2 and just displayed the unscaled image natively, thereby truncating 320px vertically and 200px horizontally.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure what caused this, the reboot into Recovery Mode might have forced a reset of the scaling settings, fixing the issue. Maybe choosing a different scaling for the display might have worked, too."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing display issues on their 2020 M1 MacBook Pro running Big Sur, where approximately 300 pixels at the bottom and 200 pixels on the right side of the screen are not visible. What is the most likely cause of this problem?\n\nA) The user accidentally enabled an accessibility zoom feature\nB) The external display is interfering with the built-in display settings\nC) The MacBook failed to properly scale the rendered screen image\nD) The dock position is causing conflicts with the display resolution\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe most likely cause is that the MacBook failed to properly scale the rendered screen image. The 13-inch MacBook Pro has a native resolution of 2560x1600, but typically renders at 2880x1800 to create a 1440x900@2x scaled display for better accessibility. In this case, it appears the MacBook rendered the larger image but failed to scale it down to fit the physical screen, resulting in the truncation of 320 pixels vertically and 200 pixels horizontally.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the user stated they checked for zoom/magnifying settings and found nothing.\nOption B is incorrect because the issue persists both with and without an external display connected.\nOption D is incorrect because while the user moved the dock, this was a result of the display issue, not the cause.\n\nThe correct answer (C) aligns with the top answer's explanation of the rendering and scaling process that should occur but apparently malfunctioned in this case."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/180035", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/66873/"], "docs_id": 180035, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know this has been asked and answered here but since I don't have enough rep to ask a clarifying question to the person who answered it I am having to post a completely different question.\n\nI am trying to perform zonal stats on a geotiff with 6 bands (RGB and three thermal and NIR bands). Like the post below it only calculates the stats on the first band. \n\n[How does ArcGIS calculate zonal statistics with multi\\-band rasters?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/164064/how-does-arcgis-calculate-zonal-statistics-with-multi-band-rasters?answertab=oldest#tab-top)\n\nIn the screen shot in the above post, it appears that you can select a specific band when you select the \"Input value raster\", however mine doesn't look like this. I simply get the Raster Datasets rather than the Raster Bands. \n\nSo my question is, how do I get the individual bands so I can calculate zonal stats on each band in this way? Is it that I have to somehow export single bands as new rasters \\- if so how do you go about doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have the shoreline as a polygon feature class you should be able to use geometry objects to test to see if your points are within the polygon, if it is true that the point is within the polygon, delete the point and try again.\n\nHere is the help page on geometry for 10\\.3(\\[[https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10\\.3/analyze/arcpy\\-classes/geometry.htm]](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/arcpy-classes/geometry.htm]))"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working with a multi-band geotiff image and want to perform zonal statistics on each band separately. However, when selecting the \"Input value raster\" in the Zonal Statistics tool, you only see Raster Datasets rather than individual Raster Bands. What is the most efficient way to proceed?\n\nA) Export each band as a separate raster file and run zonal statistics on each new file\nB) Use the Composite Bands tool to create a new raster with only the desired band\nC) Write a custom Python script using arcpy to access individual bands\nD) Use the Make Raster Layer tool to create separate layers for each band\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Make Raster Layer tool allows you to create a layer from a specific band of a multi-band raster without creating new files. This is the most efficient method as it doesn't require exporting data or writing custom scripts. Option A would work but is less efficient as it requires creating new files. Option B would not solve the problem as it creates a new raster rather than isolating bands. Option C is possible but unnecessarily complex for this task. Option D provides a straightforward solution using existing ArcGIS tools to access individual bands for zonal statistics."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/01/02", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/235151", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/84677/"], "docs_id": 235151, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have configured hostapd as an access point following several how\\-tos using ubuntu 12\\.04\\.

This tool asks the user for input\\-output examples and an English description or list of keywords describing the desired manipulation. Then, the tool will search for a program using the library that satisfies the examples. If such a program is simple enough, it will be found and displayed to the user.\n\nA proof\\-of\\-concept demo of the tool was well\\-received by the team developing this library, and they expressed excitement about the public use of this tool once it is completed.\n\nThere are already many questions on Stack Overflow that could be answered with the help of this tool. Such questions have the following properties:\n\n* The question indicates a desire to use the library, either in the text or the tags.\n* The question describes in English what kind of manipulation is desired.\n* The question provides one or more input\\-output examples demonstrating the desired manipulation, or the English description of the desired manipulation is so clear that such an example could easily be constructed.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\nWould it be appropriate to do the following:\n\n1. Manually identify questions with the properties above. (We may attempt to do this step automatically in the future.)\n2. If the question does not provide an input\\-output example, manually create one.\n3. Use the tool to automatically search for an answer to the question.\n4. Automatically post a generated answer (if found) on Stack Overflow.\n\nI anticipate auto\\-generated answers to have the following form (suggestions for improvement are welcome):\n\n> Here is one way of achieving this manipulation:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [code]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> For example, given the inputs\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [representation of the inputs for one example]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> this program will produce the output\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [representation of the corresponding output]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> This program uses the following functions from \\[library]:\n> \n> \n> * \\[Link to official documentation for function 1]\n> * \\[Link to official documentation for function 2]\n> * etc.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> This answer was generated and posted automatically by \\[tool]. Try it yourself at \\[link to tool].\n> \n> \n> I am a bot, so unfortunately, I cannot respond to comments.\n\nNote that we cannot automatically write an intuitive explanation of why the program works. However, we expect most generated programs to be understandable by themselves, especially with links to official documentation for all relevant functions.\n\nWhat does the community think about these kinds of auto\\-generated answers? Some possible effects of this include:\n\n* Users of the library become aware of a self\\-help tool that can often answer this class of question within seconds.\n* The tool can provide answers to old questions that have not yet been answered.\n* The tool can produce an answer that complements an existing answer. The auto\\-generated program may be simpler than the existing answer's solution program, and human\\-written answers rarely include links to documentation for all relevant functions.\n* Barring critical bugs in the tool, it is guaranteed to produce a program that matches the input\\-output examples. Sometimes human\\-written answers are not complete because they only solve a simplification of the question.\n* Often human answers propose solutions that involve deprecated functions. The tool can stay up\\-to\\-date with deprecation and new features offered by the library.\n* There is reduced burden on the library developers or other experts to manually answer such questions.\n* The automated system is not available to answer follow\\-up questions posed by the question asker via comments.\n* If the input\\-output example is too simple or ambiguous, the auto\\-generated program might not generalize fully, or it might fail for edge cases. (I will attempt to avoid or clarify such questions when manually identifying questions to process, but mistakes are still possible.)\n* Even though auto\\-generated answers provide a solution program with helpful links to documentation, some might still consider them to be spam.\n\nWhat additional policies should I follow to ensure that the auto\\-generated answers are well\\-received? For example, perhaps it would be better to only process questions without an accepted answer.\n\nPlease keep in mind that manually reviewing every generated answer before posting it is most likely not an option on my end. However, high\\-level human monitoring of the tool's progress is reasonable, e.g., manually investigating negative\\-scored answers and modifying or deleting them if necessary.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis is not a proposal to search Google, or any existing knowledge base, for already\\-written answers. The goal would be to use [program synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis) techniques to generate new helpful programs from scratch. In our preliminary testing using existing questions on Stack Overflow, our system can sometimes find better solutions than the ones proposed by human answerers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a personal answer, not some kind of official mod (un)endorsement.\n\n---\n\nI love this kind of stuff.

We currently use SVN and we're slowly porting over to Git, after everyone gets their training.\n\nCurrently our clients are the ones who \"pull the trigger\" on branch integration. Meaning that some module or feature is built and then, that feature sits in a branch until the client asks that it go live. When it goes live, we merge the branch into a staging environment and do testing. Then once the testing confirms everything is working as it should, we then merge those changes into the trunk for the live push.\n\nIt's done this way because often we have a lot of parallel development and often requirements are always changing on the fly. So, to isolate and control what goes where, we put each module or feature in its own branch.\n\nFor a long time we've been having issues for managing branches. So, for example we might build a branch with feature A. Six months will go by and finally the client or the development manager will want to move that change ahead, **if either of them remembers**. This is where my problem is. **What are some ways I can keep track of what branches have been merged? or not merged? A centralized way of keeping an eye on all these changes.**\n\nThis can be a challenge to manage, because often as a lead at my company, I'm required to do project management, code, code review, integration on several platforms. The leads here are not silo'd, we're required to be part of all development everywhere. So often, at any point I'll have up to 7\\-10 different items on my ToDo list, and integration and branch management can slip through the cracks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have a lot of parallel development consider using a Master branch and feature toggles.\n\nIt does require some extra discipline to ensure that the build works (even if the feature toggled code is incomplete) and to create, use, and then later cleanup the feature toggles. This can be offset somewhat by having static analysis tools and automated tests to both prove functionality works, but also to ensure its unavailability when toggled off.\n\nThe benefits though are that merging is a non\\-issue, because there are very few branches and those that do exist are merged quickly. Additionally this removes much of the branch management too. It also decouples deployments from feature releases. This can be a very nice sell to your clients/marketing department assuring them of both stability, and usability enhancements as new features can be disabled if they have unforeseen issues.\n\nIf you have a risk adverse environment or need to support several release lines, use the branching mechanism to spin off a release branch. This branch can have incomplete, or non\\-releasable features removed from it. This is fine as the branch will never be merged back into the main branch. Defect fixes can be engineered on the mainline and cheery picked across to the release branch."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small company with 6 developers is transitioning from SVN to Git and facing challenges with branch management.

This approach addresses several key issues mentioned in the documentation:\n\n1. It reduces the need for extensive branch management, which is a primary concern for the technical lead.\n2. It allows for parallel development without creating multiple long-lived branches.\n3. It decouples deployments from feature releases, providing flexibility for client decisions.\n4. It minimizes merging issues, as most code is integrated into the master branch regularly.\n5. It accommodates changing requirements by allowing features to be toggled on or off easily.\n\nWhile options A and C could help track branches, they don't address the root cause of the problem and would add additional administrative overhead.

Similarly, in the context of R and Spec R, we have a bidirectional functional relationship, where elements of each can be viewed as functions on the other.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while it's true that the duality between R and Spec R involves different categories, the question asks for the best description of the connection to double duals, which this option fails to address.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it overstates the analogy.

You either define a `foo_port_t` type in the policy, allow you4 app access to it, like this:\n\n```\nallow foo_t foo_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;\n\n```\n\nand the use something like this to label the actual port\n\n```\nsemanage port -a -t foo_port_t -p tcp 803\n\n```\n\nThis will claim TCP port 803 for your application. Most ports below 1023 already have labels on them though and you cannot label a port, file, whatever multiple times.\n\nSo option two: you can allow your app to bind to a port that has a different label, by putting lines like this into your policy module:\n\n```\nrequire { \n    type http_port_t;\n}\n\nallow foo_t http_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;\n\n```\n\nThis would allow you app to bind to any port that has `http_port_t` (meaning 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009 and 8443\\). You can find what label the port (803 in this example) you want to use, has by this command:\n\n```\nsemanage port -l | grep 803\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided SELinux documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're configuring SELinux to allow a custom application named \"myapp\" to bind to port 800, which is below 1024.

Allow the application to bind to any port\n\nD) 1. Add to policy module: allow myapp_t port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;\n   2. Restart the SELinux service\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct and most appropriate approach for this scenario. Here's why:\n\n1. It first checks if port 800 already has an existing SELinux type assigned to it. This is important because ports below 1024 often have pre-defined labels.\n\n2. If an existing type is found, it uses that type in the policy module. This adheres to the principle of least privilege and avoids creating unnecessary new types.\n\n3. The policy module addition correctly requires the existing port type and allows the application (myapp_t) to bind to that port type.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes creating a new port type is necessary, which may not be the case and could conflict with existing labels for ports below 1024.\n\nOption C is incorrect and unsafe as it completely disables SELinux, removing all security benefits it provides.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses a generic port_t type, which is too broad and violates the principle of least privilege.

The error log reveals a \"SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory\" message. What is the most likely cause of this issue and the recommended solution?\n\nA) The server's PHP version is incompatible with Magento. Upgrade PHP to the latest version.\nB) The MySQL database is corrupted. Perform a database repair and optimization.\nC) The MySQL host defined in app/etc/local.xml cannot be resolved consistently.

Clear all caches and reindex the database.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The error \"SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory\" typically occurs when the Zend Framework cannot resolve the MySQL host defined in the app/etc/local.xml file. This issue is likely caused by intermittent failures in the local resolver, especially during peak loads or resource overages. The recommended solution is to contact the hosting support and request that they replace the MySQL server hostname with its IP address in the app/etc/local.xml file. This change should resolve the intermittent connection issues.

The `dd` command is used to copy and convert files.\n2. `if=original.data` specifies the input file (source).\n3. `of=copy.data` specifies the output file (destination).\n4. `ibs=512` and `obs=512` set both input and output block sizes to 512 bytes.\n5. `seek=2048` and `skip=2048` are crucial here.

Options B, C, and D either don't maintain the local network functionality or introduce unnecessary complications and expenses."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/02", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/152774", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/45178/"], "docs_id": 152774, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to override/extend the file `price-options.js`.  \n\nBut it does not work, I always get the error\n\n> TypeError: undefined is not a constructor\n\non this line\n\n```\n $.widget('myCompany.mypriceoptions', $.mage.priceOptions, {\n\n```\n\nHere are my files:\n\n**myCompany\\\\myModule\\\\view\\\\frontend\\\\requirejs\\-config.js**\n\n```\nvar config = {\n\n    map: {\n        '*': {\n            priceOptions: 'myCompany_myModule/js/price-options',\n\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\n**myCompany\\\\myModule\\\\view\\\\frontend\\\\web\\\\js\\\\price\\-options.js**\n\n```\ndefine([\n    'jquery',\n    'underscore',\n    'mage/template',\n    'priceUtils',\n    'priceBox',\n    'priceOptions'\n], function ($, _, mageTemplate, utils) {\n    'use strict';\n    var globalOptions = {\n        qtyFieldSelector: 'input.qty',\n    };\n    $.widget('myCompany.mypriceoptions', $.mage.priceOptions, {\n        options: globalOptions,\n\n        _onOptionChanged: function onOptionChanged(event) {\n            console.log('TEST!');\n            var changes,\n                option = $(event.target),\n                handler = this.options.optionHandlers[option.data('role')];\n            option.data('optionContainer', option.closest(this.options.controlContainer));\n\n            if (handler && handler instanceof Function) {\n                changes = handler(option, this.options.optionConfig, this);\n            } else {\n                changes = defaultGetOptionValue(option, this.options.optionConfig);\n            }\n            $(this.options.priceHolderSelector).trigger('updatePrice', changes);\n        },\n\n    });\n\n    return $.myCompany.mypriceoptions;\n\n});\n\n```\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI tried to use mixins:\n\n**myCompany\\\\myModule\\\\view\\\\frontend\\\\requirejs\\-config.js**\n\n```\nvar config = {\n\n    config: {\n        mixins: {\n            'Magento_Catalog/js/price-options': {\n                'myCompany_myModule/js/price-options': true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n};\n\n```\n\n**myCompany\\\\myModule\\\\view\\\\frontend\\\\web\\\\js\\\\price\\-options.js**\n\n```\ndefine([\n    'jquery',\n    'underscore',\n    'mage/template',\n    'priceUtils',\n    'priceBox',\n    'priceOptions'\n], function ($, _, mageTemplate, utils) {\n    'use strict';\n    return function (priceOptions) {\n\n        return $.widget('mage.priceOptions', priceOptions, {\n\n            _onOptionChanged: function onOptionChanged(event) {\n                console.log('TEST!');\n                var changes,\n                    option = $(event.target),\n                    handler = this.options.optionHandlers[option.data('role')];\n                option.data('optionContainer', option.closest(this.options.controlContainer));\n\n                if (handler && handler instanceof Function) {\n                    changes = handler(option, this.options.optionConfig, this);\n                } else {\n                    changes = defaultGetOptionValue(option, this.options.optionConfig);\n                }\n                $(this.options.priceHolderSelector).trigger('updatePrice', changes);\n            }\n\n        });\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\nThe Result is that the .js file appears in the browser, but still the magento function is used instead of the costume one.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The mixins functionality may help us to solve our issue:\n\n* [http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2\\.1/javascript\\-dev\\-guide/javascript/js\\_mixins.html](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/javascript-dev-guide/javascript/js_mixins.html)\n* [http://alanstorm.com/the\\-curious\\-case\\-of\\-magento\\-2\\-mixins/](http://alanstorm.com/the-curious-case-of-magento-2-mixins/)\n\nIn your `app/code/Namespace/Modulename/view/frontend/requirejs-config.js`\n\n```\nvar config = {\n    config: {\n        mixins: {\n            priceOptions: {\n                'Namespace_Modulename/js/price-options': true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\nRead more here: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7322>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 2, you need to override the functionality of the 'price-options.js' file. Which of the following approaches is the recommended way to achieve this without directly modifying the core file?\n\nA) Create a new JS file with the same name in your custom theme and implement the changes there.\n\nB) Use RequireJS mapping to replace the original file with your custom version.\n\nC) Utilize Magento 2's mixins functionality to extend and modify the existing widget.\n\nD) Directly edit the core 'price-options.js' file to implement your changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe recommended approach to override or extend JavaScript functionality in Magento 2 without modifying core files is to use mixins. Mixins allow you to modify or extend existing JavaScript components without replacing them entirely. This method is more maintainable and less likely to cause conflicts with future updates.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while theme overrides can work for some files, it's not the best practice for modifying JavaScript functionality.\n\nOption B, using RequireJS mapping, can work but it completely replaces the original file, which may lead to maintenance issues and conflicts with other modules.\n\nOption C is correct because it uses Magento 2's built-in mixins functionality, which is designed specifically for extending and modifying existing JavaScript components.\n\nOption D is incorrect and should be avoided, as directly editing core files is bad practice and will likely cause issues with updates and maintenance.\n\nTo implement the mixin, you would need to create a requirejs-config.js file in your module with the mixin configuration, and then create your mixin JavaScript file to extend the functionality of the original widget."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/05", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/119413", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/46155/"], "docs_id": 119413, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If you fire your gun in any level there is a countdown.

The exit is now blocked by officers who will shoot on sight. Which of the following strategies is most likely to allow you to complete the level successfully?\n\nA) Wait for the police to leave on their own\nB) Attempt to negotiate with the officers\nC) Shoot the officer at the subway entrance from a concealed position\nD) Surrender to the police and restart the level\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. The documentation doesn't suggest that the police will leave on their own.\nB) Incorrect. There's no mention of a negotiation mechanic in the game.\nC) Correct. The documentation specifically states that shooting the officer at the subway entrance from a hidden position is the only known way to proceed.\nD) Incorrect. While this might be possible, it's not the solution suggested by the documentation and would not allow you to complete the current level.\n\nThe correct strategy, as outlined in the documentation, is to shoot the police officer standing at the subway entrance from a concealed position where you can't be seen, such as a darkened window or doorway. This approach allows you to clear the exit without being shot, potentially enabling you to complete the level despite the police presence."}}
