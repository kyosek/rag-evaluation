The second command uses pdftk to overlay this shifted content onto the original document, effectively creating a duplicate of the content on the same page.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it uses the wrong offset ('-110mm 0mm' would shift horizontally instead of vertically) and uses 'merge' instead of 'stamp', which would create two separate pages instead of overlaying them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it scales the content, which is not what we want in this scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it attempts to use pdftk to duplicate the page, but this would create two separate pages instead of duplicating the content on one page."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/11", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/233064", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/105567/"], "docs_id": 233064, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am confused about whether one should put a comma before an \"and\" which is being used after a list of items containing at least one other \"and\". \n\nI don't use the Oxford comma, and I feel it's not necessary to put a comma before an \"and\" which is before the last item. I do know that if one item has an \"and\" in it, then we have to put a comma before the \"and\" to clear any ambiguity. But I am confused about a particular sentence which is mentioned below:\n\n> I will certainly go to university with a more motivated and mature attitude **and** contribute to its multicultural environment.\n\nHere, I don't think a comma is necessary before the \"and\" which is before \"contribute\", as there is no ambiguity. So should I put a comma or not? If I do not put one, is it grammatically incorrect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your question isn't about a list of items.\n\nThe second 'and' does not add an item to a list. Instead it joins two phrases:\n\n* certainly go to university with a more motivated and mature attitude\n* contribute to its multicultural environment\n\nEach of these phrases contains a verb and an object. (The 'will' part of each verb is extracted out to the beginning, which makes the phrases a bit less obvious.)\n\nI contend that you would make it easier to read, and include a pause for reading aloud, by following the convention of adding a comma between phrases, so include the comma before \"and contribute.\"\n\nYou have a list of two adjectives earlier in the sentence: the adjectives are *motivated* and *mature*. As there are only two items, never use an Oxford comma (also known as a [serial comma](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/412/should-i-put-a-comma-before-the-last-item-in-a-list/).)\n\nYou might prefer to write the sentence as two clauses, so you repeat the subject, and you make the logic more clear.

Adding a comma before \"and contribute\" helps separate these phrases, making the sentence easier to read and understand.

It just requires that it happened before the implied 'now' of the sentence.\n\nIn your sentence, the event in 1917 is used as a time reference. The refusal happened after this time reference, but it (the refusal) was also 'completed' in the past. There is some flexibility in the use of tenses.

These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.\n\nMicroservices advantages over monolithic applications:\n\n> the microservice architectural style: building applications as suites of services. As well as the fact that services are independently deployable and scalable, each service also provides a firm module boundary, even allowing for different services to be written in different programming languages.

I've followed multiple DIY tutorials and have bought the tools that I need, all of them refer to finding studs in the drywall and drilling in to them.\n\nDrywall is a new concept to me, I come from a country with concrete walls. I haven't quite understood what studs are, can anyone help explain what they are and what their purpose is?\n\nAs far as I've been able to make out the stud is a metallic sheet where the drywall is screwed in, so I should be looking to find an existing a nail in the stud and then screw the bracket with an anchor above/below it. The other thing that I was wondering about was if both the brackets should be drilled into studs or is just one side enough and what happens if the length of the shelf is such that the other side doesn't align with a stud.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a ton of information and history out there.\n\nStuds are strong pieces that are the internal structure of your walls. They are covered by some type of material (the \"skin\") that is what you see when you look at a wall. If you imagine your wall without any type of skin material, there are probably two studs at the left and right edges and definitely two framing members (similar material as studs, but the term *studs* explicitly refers to the vertical members) going horizontally at the floor and ceiling forming a rectangle. This rectangle has many vertical studs inside of it, usually space at 16\" or 24\". \n\nA term you'll see sometimes is *16\" O.C.* which means *On Center*; it just means the center\\-line between two studs is 16\" apart and there is about 15\\.25\" of air in between them.\n\nYour studs are covered on both sides by something. These days it is typically drywall (sheetrock) which is cheaper and easier to install than most alternatives. Your surface could also be plaster, paneling, tile, etc.\n\nYou need to use a stud finder to locate where your studs are because you need to attach heavy objects to studs. Drywall can only support very little weight. To use a stud finder:\n\n1. Put masking tape horizontally on your wall.\n2. Place the stud finder against the wall, holding it vertical.\n3. Press and hold the button.\n\t* Hold it still for the first half second so it can calibrate itself.\n4. Move the stud finder horizontally across the wall and mark on the tape where the signal is strong.\n\t* If the signal acts weird, make sure you slide the stud finder sideways at the same height.\n5. Take a tape measure and try to find a pattern between your marks that is 16\" or 24\" apart.\n6. Now you can measure multiples of 16\" or 24\" and know where other studs are.\n\nYou need to determine if your stud are wood or steel because the type of fasteners (screws) you use depend on it. \n\nThere are other methods of determining this, but here's one: Figure out where your fasteners are going to go and drill a small pilot hole (smaller than the size of the fastener). If you get about a 1/2\" deep and hear a terrible screeching noise followed by your drill bit sliding and having no resistance, you have steel studs. If you get 1\" in and you start to see saw dust coming out of your pilot hole and your drill still feels like it's biting at something, you have wood studs.\n\nIf you have wood studs, you can use general construction screws (**NOT** drywall screws). If they are steel, you probably have to use toggle bolts. Toggle bolts are a pain to use, so you can try using self\\-tapping machine screws with a **fine thread** first. Make sure your fasteners are long enough.\n\nThere are many other types of walls out there so if things don't seem right, maybe they're not typical stud walls."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are installing wall shelves in a home with drywall construction. During the process, you encounter the following scenario:\n\n1. Your stud finder indicates studs at irregular intervals.\n2. When drilling a pilot hole, you hear a screeching noise after about 1/2 inch.\n3. The shelf you want to install is 36 inches long.\n\nGiven this information, what is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Use toggle bolts to secure the shelf brackets directly to the drywall at your preferred locations.\n\nB) Use wood screws to attach the brackets to the studs, even if it means the shelf won't be centered where you want it.\n\nC) Use self-tapping machine screws with a fine thread to secure the brackets to the metal studs at your preferred locations.\n\nD) Use drywall anchors to install the shelf brackets wherever you want, ignoring the stud locations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario presents several key points that lead to the correct answer:\n\n1. Irregular stud intervals suggest non-standard construction, which could indicate metal studs.\n2. The screeching noise when drilling and stopping at about 1/2 inch depth is a clear indication of metal studs.\n3. The 36-inch shelf length might not align with standard stud spacing.\n\nGiven these factors, the best course of action is to use self-tapping machine screws with a fine thread. These are suitable for metal studs and will allow you to secure the brackets at your preferred locations, ensuring the shelf is positioned where you want it. This method provides a secure attachment while accommodating the metal stud construction and allowing flexibility in shelf placement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because toggle bolts are unnecessary if you can attach to studs. Option B is not ideal because it limits your placement options and may not work with metal studs. Option D is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as drywall anchors alone are not suitable for supporting heavy loads like shelves."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/28", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/194363", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/68788/"], "docs_id": 194363, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I stumbled upon this paragraph.\n\n> ... the phone felt sticky with sweat against her ear.

But is there any way to keep my custom field file inside my custom module instead in `lib/Varien/Data/Form/Element/`? **Adding custom files to the core directories isn't probably very good idea.**\n2. If not, can I create custom folder inside `lib/`, for example: `lib/Mycompany/Customized.php`? But in that case, how I can inform Magento in the `<frontend_type>` tag inside **system.xml** that it should use my custom field file and tell Magento where that file is located?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So the easy but not recommended way is to put your element under app/code/local/Varien/Data/Form/Element/. As Magento is simply using the order of include\\_paths and will first look into the local folder, before it goes to the lib folder.\n\nBut the wiring to Varien\\_Data\\_Form\\_Element is just a fallback which is defined in lib\\\\Varien\\\\Data\\\\Form\\\\Abstract.php.\n\n```\npublic function addField($elementId, $type, $config, $after=false)\n{\n    if (isset($this->_types[$type])) {\n        $className = $this->_types[$type];\n    }\n    else {\n        $className = 'Varien_Data_Form_Element_'.ucfirst(strtolower($type));\n    }\n\n```\n\nSo the question is where can you defined that \\_types array? There is an addType method in the same class which can be called. When you search for that method you might stumble over an iteration of \\_getAdditionalElementTypes on the form block in app\\\\code\\\\core\\\\Mage\\\\Adminhtml\\\\Block\\\\Widget\\\\Form.php\n\n```\nprotected function _addElementTypes(Varien_Data_Form_Abstract $baseElement)\n{\n    $types = $this->_getAdditionalElementTypes();\n    foreach ($types as $code => $className) {\n        $baseElement->addType($code, $className);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe default implementation of \\_getAdditionalElementTypes just returns an empty array, but there is already some working implementation in the Magento Core in Mage\\_Adminhtml\\_Block\\_Sales\\_Order\\_Create\\_Form\\_Abstract.\n\nSo that example looks like:\n\n```\nprotected function _getAdditionalFormElementTypes()\n{\n    return array(\n        'file'      => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/customer_form_element_file'),\n        'image'     => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/customer_form_element_image'),\n        'boolean'   => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/customer_form_element_boolean'),\n    );\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd even in your form which you need to extend: Mage\\_Adminhtml\\_Block\\_System\\_Config\\_Form\n\n```\nprotected function _getAdditionalElementTypes()\n{\n    return array(\n        'export'        => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/system_config_form_field_export'),\n        'import'        => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/system_config_form_field_import'),\n        'allowspecific' => Mage::getConfig()\n            ->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/system_config_form_field_select_allowspecific'),\n        'image'         => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/system_config_form_field_image'),\n        'file'          => Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName('adminhtml/system_config_form_field_file')\n    );\n}\n\n```\n\nBased on that you should be able to implement your own \\_getAdditonalFormElementTypes by rewriting the System\\_Config\\_Form which can then handle new frontend types in your config.\n\n\u20ac: Thinking about the question of Fabian it should also be possible by using an observer. The addType method on the form element is public, so you can call that and add custom types from and observer. You need to listen to an event in the form object and in the observer add your custom types. Just make sure this happens before \\_initFields, which is called from initForm. So a good point can be the prepare\\_layout events which are called before the initForm method (see Mage\\_Adminhtml\\_Block\\_System\\_Config\\_Edit\\-\\>initForm and Mage\\_Core\\_Block\\_Abstract\\-\\>setLayout)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to create a custom field type for use in Magento's system configuration forms.

It allows you to keep your custom field type within your module, maintaining separation of concerns.

This is generally more invasive and can lead to conflicts with other modules or future Magento updates. Using an observer, as in option C, is a more flexible and maintainable solution."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/13", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/179907", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/80923/"], "docs_id": 179907, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I think I'm missing something fundamental in the math surrounding capacitors.\n\nSuppose I have a 1 F capacitor that is not charged. The voltage across its terminals is 0 V.\n\nNow suppose I connect a 1 V battery to it. The voltage across its terminals is therefore 1 V.\n\nThe current to it is given by:\n\n```\nI(t) = C dV(t)/dt\n\n```\n\nBut the voltage has jumped in a non\\-continuous manner from 0V to 1V.\n\nTherefore `dV(t)/dt` is \"infinite\" (or undefined) at the time t where I connected the battery. It jumped from 0V to 1V \"instantaneously\". This implies the current is infinite at this point.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you are missing is that you are working with ideal components. You are assuming that the capacitor and the battery have no resistance. In that case, yes, current would be infinite and the time to charge tha capacitor would be infinitely short.\n\nWe don't, however, have ideal components to work with. The battery will have an internal resistance (NOT a discrete part, but caused by the physics and chemistry of the battery.) The capacitor also has an internal resistance (again, this is inherent to the materials.) \n\nThese resistances prevent infinite currents from flowing, and prevent an instantaneous change in voltage.\n\nYou need to use equations that take the effects of the resitances into consideration.\nSpecifically you need to look into the [RC time constant.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant) \n\nThe RC time constant (T) is the product of the resistance (in Ohms) and the capacitance (in Farads.) T \\= RC\n\nT is the number of seconds it will take the capacitor to charge to 63 percent of the target voltage \\- in your case, 0\\.63 Volts.\n\nIf the capacitor and the battery together have 1 Ohm of internal resistance, then T would be 1 Second. Taking t as 1 second, dV(t)/dt would then be 0\\.63 which leads to I(t) being 0\\.63Amperes, at which point the capacitor is only charged to 0\\.63 volts.\n\nI've probably screwed up something in there, but the point is that infinite currents only occur in ideal circuits with no resistance."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 100 \u03bcF capacitor with an internal resistance of 2 \u03a9 is connected to a 9V battery with an internal resistance of 1 \u03a9.

The initial current can be calculated using Ohm's law: I = V/R = 9V / 3\u03a9 = 3A.\n\nThe RC time constant is calculated as T = R * C = 3\u03a9 * 100\u03bcF = 300\u03bcs = 0.3 ms. This is the time it takes for the capacitor to charge to 63% of the final voltage.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overestimates the initial current.

I've started remodeling and in tearing out my kitchen I discovered the wall between me and my neighbors is only that: a wall. No fire protection just drywall, regular (old) insulation and drywall. Any simple suggestions besides tearing down all the drywall?\n\nI'll be installing Roxul Safe'n'Sound\u2122 in the interior walls. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Type X drywall, which is typically 5/8\" thick (as opposed to 1/2\") and contains fiberglass within the gypsum is typically used for fire protection. I believe it increases the burn through time to around 1 hour, and it increases the impact resistance (there's often falling debris in a fire). For further protection, every electrical junction box should be enclosed around the back, top, and bottom with 2x4's and plywood to prevent fires from burning through the box, or a fire that starts in the box from spreading quickly to the other side. Additionally, every penetration in the wall should be sealed with fire rated caulking (it's typically orange in color, and they also have a similar expanding foam of the same color, so it's easy for the building inspector to verify you used the correct product).\n\nThe safe and sound insulation is a great addition. The only other thing you could do is to add a 1\" air gap and a second wall on your side, which would help with both the spread of fire and sound, but the downside is that you'd lose almost 6\" of space in your kitchen.\n\nRealize that no structure will be fire proof, the goal is to slow the spread until the fire department can get there. And the last small fire I saw in a townhouse resulted in half a dozen engines, ladder trucks, etc, because they take the risk of a spreading fire very seriously."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is renovating their 1961 condo and discovers that the wall shared with their neighbor lacks proper fire protection. Which combination of measures would provide the most comprehensive fire protection without significantly reducing living space?\n\nA) Install Type X drywall, seal electrical junction boxes with 2x4s and plywood, use fire-rated caulking for wall penetrations\nB) Add a 1\" air gap and a second wall, install Roxul Safe'n'Sound\u2122 insulation, use regular drywall\nC) Use regular drywall, install Roxul Safe'n'Sound\u2122 insulation, seal electrical junction boxes with fire-rated foam\nD) Install Type X drywall, use regular insulation, add a 1\" air gap and a second wall\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A provides the most comprehensive fire protection without significantly reducing living space. Type X drywall offers enhanced fire resistance and impact protection. Sealing electrical junction boxes with 2x4s and plywood prevents fire spread through these vulnerable points. Using fire-rated caulking for wall penetrations further enhances fire containment. This combination addresses multiple aspects of fire protection without requiring the addition of a second wall, which would reduce living space.\n\nOption B includes adding a second wall, which would significantly reduce living space. While it includes Safe'n'Sound insulation, it lacks the fire-resistant properties of Type X drywall and doesn't address junction boxes or penetrations.\n\nOption C uses regular drywall, which lacks the fire-resistant properties of Type X drywall. While it includes Safe'n'Sound insulation, the use of fire-rated foam for junction boxes is not as comprehensive as the plywood and 2x4 method.\n\nOption D combines Type X drywall with a second wall, which would provide good fire protection but at the cost of significant living space reduction. It also uses regular insulation instead of the fire-resistant Safe'n'Sound, and doesn't address junction boxes or penetrations."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/19", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/88946", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/21546/"], "docs_id": 88946, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our university has an Honors section of our \"liberal arts mathematics\" course.

Nick Drakos \\& Ross Moore's [Latex2html](http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/latex2html) converter, written in Perl, which I think was the first converter to map equations to Math ML. In 1998, Ross Moore outlined [his goals for Latex2html](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~ross/webtex/webtex/), tied to the now defunct, closed\\-source WebEq mathematics rendering software, and Webtex, which was an alternative syntax for mathematics designed for use in web pages. From [the WebEq documentation](http://www.sungchichu.com:8080/WebEQ.3.7/docs/reference/WebTeX/wtxsec1.html): *WebTeX always translates unambiguously into MathML, while LaTeX does not*.\n2. [itex2mml](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html), in C by Paul Gartside \\& others, also based on Webtex, but with support for some Latex not supported in Webtex.\n3. [tex4ht](http://www.tug.org/tex4ht/), written in C by Eitan Gurari and other eminent figures. It avoids having to parse Latex source by running `latex` with modified macros that insert specials into the DVI output, and parses the DVI output instead.\n4. John McFarlan's [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), as mentioned by Aditya, written in Haskell. Note that Pandoc supports generation of HTML, both with and without Math ML.\n5. MathJax allows generation of Math ML besides the usual boxes plus image fonts output. It has [an impressive degree of support for Latex](http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?tex.html#supported-latex-commands), including limited support for user macros.\n\n**Parsers generating XML**\n\nJason Blevins has a list of tools that convert Latex documents to XML\\-based formats, and that handle equations reasonably. Romeo Anghelache's [Hermes](http://hermes.roua.org/), which is part of a full Latex parser that generates XML with semantic markup, is worth singling out: like tex4ht, it works by running the Tex engine with macros to put specials in the DVI output, which it then parses; it supports a wider set of semantic markup. \n\n**Fragments of Latex or DVI**\n\nWith the exception of the systems referencing Webtex, there doesn't seem to be much interest in clearly codifying subsets of Latex to be parsed, I guess because these are regarded as moving targets. Instead, lists of commands supported, like that I mentioned for Mathjax, seems to be the way things are done.\n\nWith DVI\\-based converters, the issue of parsing Latex goes away, replaced by the relatively trivial issue of parsing marked\\-up DVI and the trickier issue of identifying the semantically significant macros and constructing markup\\-issuing replacements that do not improperly interfere. I haven't looked at how this is done for equational layout. It would be a useful exercise to see how a converter from Tex formulae to those of It's worth noting that the representation of expressions is essentially a superset of that used by Heckmann \\& Wilhelm (1997\\) would work.\n\n**Syntax highlighting**\n\nA completely different kind of parsing is involved in syntax highlighting, where the idea is to help the author see the significance of the parts of the formulae. I don't know of any syntax highlighters that do an interesting job here: Auctex only raisers/lowers super\\&subscripts, but i haven't really looked.\n\n**Reference**\n\nHeckmann \\& Wilhelm, 1997, [A Functional Description of TeX's Formula Layout](http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~heckmann/abstracts/neuform.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about TeX mathematics parsers is most accurate?\n\nA) MathJax is primarily designed for parsing TeX and generating PDF output.\n\nB) Latex2html was one of the earliest converters to map equations to MathML, and it's written in C.\n\nC) tex4ht parses LaTeX source directly to generate HTML and MathML output.\n\nD) Pandoc, written in Haskell, supports generation of HTML both with and without MathML for mathematical expressions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because MathJax is primarily a rendering library for JavaScript, not for generating PDF output.\n\nB is partially correct about Latex2html being an early converter to MathML, but it's written in Perl, not C.\n\nC is incorrect because tex4ht doesn't parse LaTeX source directly.

See pages 260\\-266 of Pinheiro/Bates.\n\nA good first step is to make a variogram to see how the correlation depends on distance.\n\n```\nlibrary(nlme)\nm0 <- gls(response ~ level, data = layout)  \nplot(Variogram(m0, form=~x+y))\n\n```\n\nHere the sample semivariogram increases with distance indicating that the observations are indeed spatially correlated.\n\nOne option for the correlation structure is a spherical structure; that could be modeled in the following way.\n\n```\nm1 <- update(m0, corr=corSpher(c(15, 0.25), form=~x+y, nugget=TRUE))\n\n```\n\nThis model does seem to fit better than the model with no correlation structure, though it's entirely possible it too could be improved on with one of the other possible correlation structures.\n\n```\n> anova(m0, m1)\n   Model df     AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\nm0     1  3 46.5297 49.80283 -20.26485                        \nm1     2  5 43.3244 48.77961 -16.66220 1 vs 2 7.205301  0.0273\n\n```\n\n2\\) You could also try including `x` and `y` directly in the model; this could be appropriate if the pattern of correlation depends on more than just distance. In your case (looking at sesqu's pictures) it seems that for this block anyway, you may have a diagonal pattern.\n\nHere I'm updating the original model instead of m0 because I'm only changing the fixed effects, so the models should both be fit using maximum likelihood.\n\n```\n> model2 <- update(model, .~.+x*y)\n> anova(model, model2)\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: response ~ level\nModel 2: response ~ level + x + y + x:y\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F   Pr(>F)   \n1     22 5.3809                                \n2     19 2.7268  3    2.6541 6.1646 0.004168 **\n\n```\n\nTo compare all three models, you'd need to fit them all with `gls` and the maximum likelihood method instead of the default method of REML.\n\n```\n> m0b <- update(m0, method=\"ML\")\n> m1b <- update(m1, method=\"ML\")\n> m2b <- update(m0b, .~x*y)\n> anova(m0b, m1b, m2b, test=FALSE)\n    Model df      AIC      BIC     logLik\nm0b     1  3 38.22422 41.75838 -16.112112\nm1b     2  5 35.88922 41.77949 -12.944610\nm2b     3  5 29.09821 34.98847  -9.549103\n\n```\n\nRemember that especially with your knowledge of the study, you might be able to come up with a model that is better than any of these.

Once in lock out, the furnace has to be manually reset (depending on model).\n\nThe vacuum switch will look something like this...\n\n![Vacuum switch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JuyoF.jpg)\n\nAnd will have a rubber tube connecting it to the draft inducer. This part cannot be repaired, and must be replaced if it's faulty.\n\nPilot Not Igniting\n------------------\n\nIf the pilot does not light, you'll first want to check to make sure there is something trying to ignite it. Typically a spark or glow ignitor is used, so first you'll want to determine which is being used.\n\n### Glow Ignitor\n\nA glow ignitor looks similar to this, though may not be visible without further disassembly.\n\n![Glow ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3OVd.jpg)\n\nIt works by passing a current through it, causing it to heat up and glow. It should heat up enough to ignite the pilot gas. If it doesn't heat up, it should be replaced.\n\n### Spark Ignitor\n\nA spark ignitor looks like this.\n\n![Spark Ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KugBz.jpg)\n\nTake notice of the thick, often orange or red wire that is typically used to connect the ignitor to the ignition control module. This device works by generating an electrical arc between the two probes, causing the pilot gas to ignite. If there is no spark, you'll have to replace the ignition control module and/or the ignitor itself. If the [ignitor is not igniting the gas](https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/32529/33), but there is a spark. You can try cleaning the electrodes with fine steel wool, to remove any carbon buildup.\n\nPilot Not Proving\n-----------------\n\nFor a pilot to \"prove\", it simply means that the flame sensor has sensed the pilot flame. If there is no pilot or the sensor doesn't detect it, the furnace will often purge the system and then try again. Furnaces will often try a set number of times, before entering lock out.\n\nIf you can see the pilot flame, but the sensor is not detecting it. Try gently cleaning the sensor with fine steel wool, to remove any built up carbon. Also make sure the sensor is in the proper location with respect to the flame (Check the owners manual for proper placement), and adjust as necessary. If that doesn't work, replace the sensor.\n\nMain Burner Not Proving\n-----------------------\n\nIf the main burner ignites, but the furnace shuts down before the blower starts. You'll want to check the main flame (or rollout, high limit, etc) sensor(s). If your furnace has error code indicators, check those and compare to the owners manual for translation. In this case, you'll want to test and/or replace each sensor and/or contact an HVAC technician"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a high efficiency gas furnace, what component is responsible for detecting negative pressure and must close before the ignition sequence can continue?\n\nA) Flame sensor\nB) Vacuum switch\nC) Pilot valve\nD) Draft inducer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The vacuum switch is a crucial component in high efficiency gas furnaces. It detects the negative pressure created by the draft inducer. According to the ignition sequence provided, the vacuum switch must close (step 3) after the draft inducer starts (step 2) and before the pilot valve opens (step 4). If the vacuum switch fails to close, the furnace will not proceed with ignition and may enter a lockout state after multiple attempts. The other options, while important parts of a furnace, do not perform this specific function of detecting negative pressure to allow the ignition sequence to continue."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/01", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/462663", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/148663/"], "docs_id": 462663, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The word I'm looking for was used in the context of describing some versions of Cellular Automata (i.e. Conway's Game of Life).

[Take a look at the here.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx)\n\n> Is MVVM a super\\-set or a sub\\-set of MVC?\n\nMVVM belongs to the MVC family, so, if you can say that at all, it's a subset. It's a variant to decouple the UI from the business logic underneath. I'd describe it as a sibling of MVC. Since the early days of OOP people have been searching for ways to decouple the UI from their logic. MVC was the first archetype that evolved. It is pretty simple, although most people do not get it right. The view is just an observer to the model and calls it when necessary. The controller is just a strategy for the view to communicate with the model, for example when you need an exchangeable behaviour (i.e. ReadonlyController, AdminController). MVC is very successfull and it's really a good practice to apply it.\n\nMVVM is a specialized kind of [MVP Pattern, as described by Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html). MVP tries to keep the view as dumb as possible (while still taking user input etc.), thus enhancing the testability. It aims for an abstraction of the view and the interaction\\-logic which is to put in the presenter. The presenter solely communicates with the model/business logic and updates the View. [Martin Fowler describes MVVM pretty much in his Presentation Model Pattern.](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html)\n\nThe view is completely abstracted into a ViewModel. When the `View` needs a property, the `ViewModel` needs to have it as well. It (the ViewModel) is meant to be completely independent of underlying UI\\-technology, an abstraction. In order to communicate between View and ViewModel, a synchronization pattern needs to be used (i.e. Observer). This is not easy to accomplish in a stateless web environment. MVVM differs from MVP, as the View does not bind to your model/business logic anymore but to a ViewModel instead.\n\n> Which pattern is modern and which one should I choose for Windows \\&\n>  Web versions of my application?\n\nPresentation Model (MVVM\\-like) in theory should be completely independent of the UI\\-technology in use. However, the synchonization aspect needs to be covered. It can easily be done by binding to Commands and Properties with WPF, where the synchronization glue is already present. With ASP.NET, this is a different story. However, [there's an article on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/smart/PMinAction.aspx) which used Presentation Model Pattern with all Windows UI technologies. Have a look."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating both a Windows-based WPF application and a web-based version of an inventory and invoicing system.

For web applications, MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a more established and widely used pattern, especially in frameworks like ASP.NET MVC.\n\nMVVM is not a superset or subset of MVC, but rather a sibling pattern in the MVC family, specialized for certain UI technologies. While both patterns aim to separate concerns and improve maintainability, they have different strengths in different contexts.\n\nThe question of using the same set of classes for both versions is challenging, as MVVM's ViewModel and MVC's Controller serve different purposes. However, the Model layer could potentially be shared between both implementations.\n\nUsing MVVM for web applications or MVC for WPF applications, while possible, may not leverage the strengths of each platform and framework as effectively."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/26", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/116054", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/29520/"], "docs_id": 116054, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any kernel on which we can run Ubuntu??Like in some case Debian can run on BSD kernel (if I am correct)\nIf it is possible how can I proceed\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **For Ubuntu 11\\.10 (Unity)**\n\n1.

This is not analogue noise picked up in the cable as the signal is pure digital on route to the iPhone. The noise seems to be introduced in the digital domain. I recorded a sample of audio in my office and analysed it using Matlab. The noise fluctuates in amplitude, but it is clearly a harmonic complex with a very precise 1\\-kHz fundamental frequency. The ADC reportedly samples at 44\\.1 kHz, so it is particularly strange that the harmonic noise comes in with a periodicity that is not even an intiger multiple of the sampling period.

This is used to synchronize isochronous data flows. High\\-bandwidth USB 2\\.0 devices receive 7 additional duplicate SOF tokens per frame, each introducing a 125 \u00b5s \"microframe\" (60000 high\\-bandwidth bit times each).\n> \n> \n> USB 2\\.0 added a PING token, which asks a device if it is ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair.

The noise has a 1 kHz fundamental frequency and is present even with high-quality extension cables. What is the most likely cause of this noise, and what would be the most effective solution?\n\nA) The noise is caused by analog interference in the cable. The solution is to use a shorter cable to reduce signal degradation.\n\nB) The noise is generated by the iPhone's internal circuitry. The solution is to update the iPhone's operating system to the latest version.\n\nC) The noise is EMI from USB frame sync, likely coupling through the ground wire. The solution is to use a properly shielded extension cable or create a custom cable with high-quality shielded wires.\n\nD) The noise is a result of clock drift in the ADC. The solution is to implement a fractional delay filter in the audio processing chain.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that the noise is likely EMI from USB frame sync, which occurs at regular intervals (every millisecond). This matches the described 1 kHz fundamental frequency of the noise. The noise persists even with digital signals, suggesting it's not analog interference. The most effective solution is to use proper shielding to prevent the EMI from coupling into the audio signal path. While a fractional delay filter could potentially help, it's computationally expensive and doesn't address the root cause.

Making *n* iterations over an *O(n)* operation means *O(n\u00b2)* total complexity in general. Whether the insertion actually has *O(n)* time complexity depends on the data distribution. For example, if we were to insert elements in ascending order (so that new elements are only appended, without shifting existing values) then it could be as cheap as *O(1\\)*. However, this scenario does not make it possible to make any assumptions about the data distribution.\n\nNote that an *O*(*n* log *n*) solution *is* possible if `seen` is an ordered set data structure with *O*(log *n*) insertion, such as a balanced binary tree. Python has no suitable data structure in the standard library. The `heapq` module is similar but cannot provide the necessary operations here. A possible manual implementation might look like this:\n\n```py\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional, Tuple\n\ndef smaller_counts(lst: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    result = []\n    seen = None\n    for num in reversed(lst):\n        location, seen = treeset_insert_and_get_location(seen, num)\n        result.append(location)\n    return list(reversed(result))\n\n@dataclass\nclass Node:\n    value: int\n    size: int\n    left: 'Optional[Node]' = None\n    right: 'Optional[Node]' = None\n\n    @property\n    def left_size(self) -> int:\n        if self.left is not None:\n            return self.left.size\n        return 0\n\n    @property\n    def right_size(self) -> int:\n        if self.right is not None:\n            return self.right.size\n        return 0\n\ndef treeset_insert_and_get_location(\n        tree: Optional[Node], value: int,\n) -> Tuple[int, Node]:\n    if tree is None:\n        return 0, Node(value=value, size=1)\n\n    if value < tree.value:\n        location, tree.left = treeset_insert_and_get_location(\n            tree.left, value)\n        tree.size += 1\n        return location, tree\n\n    if value > tree.value:\n        location, tree.right = treeset_insert_and_get_location(\n            tree.right, value)\n        tree.size += 1\n        return tree.size - tree.right_size + location, tree\n\n    assert tree.value == value\n    tree.size += 1\n    return tree.left_size, tree\n\n```\n\n[full code incl. tests](https://gist.github.com/latk/60782896bd63f09bbfc80df67aa691a4)\n\nIn practice, the presented solution in the question is still going to be reasonably efficient at smaller input sizes. The *O(n)* insertion is the kind of operation that modern computers are fairly good at.

This makes \u201cpreposition\u201d a misnomer for the category (since \u201chere\u201d is not proposed to anything), but the [*Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* uses *preposition* as the label for the set of location\\-describing words](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/547159/why-does-cgel-call-home-abroad-here-and-there-prepositions-instead-of) that encompasses traditional prepositions despite the mismatch with the term\u2019s etymology.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain why languages make the language\\-specific categorizations and generalizations that they do. You can say that it is because of analogies between words with similar meanings, but clearly the same analogies have not applied in all languages.\n\nThere are similarities in behavior between prepositional phrases (in the CGEL sense) and adjective phrases, but also differences. Both can be used as predicates or to modify nominal phrases. But prepositional phrases generally cannot be placed in the pre\\-nominal attributive position: we can say *the blue house* but not *\\*the here house*.

I have washer/dryer closet and the dryer sits atop my washer (in classic fashion). However, when the washer goes into a fast spin, the dryer shakes on top a bit and makes some noise. I realized if I could just get some small (say around 3\" or 4\") compression rods on either side of the dryer (between it and the closet wall), it would really help to stabilize the movement and the sound.\n\nThe closest I could find through web searching is 6\"curtain rods, which are just too long and too weak. Ideally, I'm looking for something like what I'm showing in the illustration below. Big suction cup like ends would be great but as long as it's a fairly wide, flat surface, it could be anything (plastic, rubber, etc.).

You can get this material in various thicknesses so you would want to measure the gap from the sides of the dryer and the walls and purchase accordingly. [One Example](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01H2QS5RE)\n\nThe idea is to cut the high density padding into a square of say 1\\.5 or 2\\.0 feet on a side. Then squeeze that in between the wall and the dryer sides. You will want the material to be under some compression when it is installed. It may be necessary to insert two pads of different thicknesses on top of each other to get the needed space filled up with some compression. \n\nThis approach has some decided advantages as follows:\n\n1. The foam material will act to muffle the sound coupled to the wall. Your idea with point contact will more likely couple sound right into the wall.\n2. The foam pad extends out over a larger area of the dryer sides to provide stability and to reduce the drum head effect that metal appliance walls can create.\n3. The pad spreads the compression load over a large surface of the wall to prevent wall damage. A point type of compression assembly would have to be positioned over a stud to ensure that it does not eventually break into the wall. This would be particularly an issue for the very common drywall material made of paper and plaster material.

The high-density foam padding provides better sound dampening compared to rigid compression rods or suction cups.\n2. It distributes the stabilizing force over a larger area of the dryer and wall, reducing the risk of damage to either surface.\n3. The foam can be easily cut to size and adjusted for the perfect fit, unlike pre-made rods or suction cups.\n4. It addresses both movement and noise issues simultaneously.\n\nOption A (curtain rods) would be too weak and long for this application. Option C (suction cups) might not provide enough stability and could potentially damage the appliance or walls.

Given \u03bb = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-16 m, we can calculate E:\n\n   E \u2248 p = h/\u03bb = (2\u03c0\u210f)/\u03bb = \u210fc / (\u03bb/2\u03c0)\n   \n   E \u2248 (197 MeV\u22c5fm) / (10^-16 m / 2\u03c0) \u2248 123 GeV\n\n4. This is closest to 100 GeV in the given options.\n\n5. A particle with this energy can probe structures much smaller than a proton (which has a radius of about 0.84 fm or 4 GeV^-1).\n\nTherefore, option B is correct. This question tests understanding of the inverse relationship between energy and probed distance in particle physics, as well as the ability to perform calculations using natural units and conversions."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/01", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/213680", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/153325/"], "docs_id": 213680, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a nice set of Apple earpods, but I have a problem with them falling out of my ears. All earbuds have some tendency to fall out, but the Apple ones, while comfortable and nice sounding, are particularly slippery. I can't use the in\\-ear variety because they give me painful ear infections.\n\nSome earbuds I've used have a stickier rubber layer around the circumference that help them not to fall out. Especially in very cold winter conditions when my ear skin is less supple and sticky the rubber holds on well enough to keep the buds in my ear.\n\nI wonder if there is any kind of mild adhesive I can wrap around or apply to the earpod to make it stickier. I'd really like to have a nice reliable way to use these otherwise wonderful Apple ones through the cold months.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would like to provide a more complete answer.\n\nFirst of all, you should create an Apple ID (iCloud account) for your daughter.\n\nOnce it's done, you can activate on **your** phone what Apple calls `Family Sharing`. This will make you the family owner. You can find it in your `Settings` app. [Here is the documentation to set it up](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088).\n\nOnce done, you just have to pair her account through **her** phone to yours.\n\nThis feature will allow you to share bought application or media and give you additional features such as location... But you will also be able to share the payment methods with control options (\"need to ask for authorisation before buying anything\"...)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A parent wants to set up controlled access to app purchases for their child's iPhone.

Then, the parent should activate Family Sharing on their own phone, making them the family owner. This is done through the Settings app. After that, the child's account should be paired through the child's phone to the parent's account.
