This setting determines how long orders can remain in the \"Pending Payment\" status before being automatically cancelled. By default, it's set to 8 hours, but in cases where businesses intentionally keep orders in this status for extended periods (e.g., for orders that are shipped but not yet paid, with 30-60 day payment terms), this value should be increased significantly. Increasing it to a year, as mentioned in the example, would prevent the automatic cancellation of these orders while allowing the business to maintain its current process for handling shipped but unpaid orders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the \"Quote Lifetime\" setting is unrelated to order cancellation.\nOption B would require custom code modification and is not the standard way to address this issue.\nOption D is incorrect because there isn't a specific \"Automatically Cancel Old Orders\" feature; the behavior is controlled by the lifetime setting mentioned in the correct answer."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/08", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/272470", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/699/"], "docs_id": 272470, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From Section 5\\.1\\.4 Direct Memory Access in *Modern Operating Systems by Andrew S.

Namely:\n\n* What are the bus systems involved in this description?\n\n\t+ Most computer systems have a memory bus.\n\t+ Most computers have other kinds of bus systems as well.\n* Does the disk IO go through the memory bus also? \n\n\t+ In other words, does the disk uses the address bus lines for addresses, and the data bus lines for data?\n* Does the disk controller sees the memory bus as ...\n\n\t+ A memory bus? That is, it thinks it is talking to a memory chip; i.e. RAS (row access strobe), CAS (column access strobe), ...\n\t+ Very unlikely \\- talking to a memory chip requires one to be ultra\\-precise about issuing commands according to DRAM timing (latencies) \\- a few clock cycles too early or too late, data loss will occur.\n* So ... what does the disk controller thinks the bus \"actually is\" ?\n* In most computer systems, there is a kind of IO called \"Port I/O\".\n\n\t+ Port I/O may either piggyback on to the memory bus, or they may have another dedicated bus.\n\t+ The distinctive feature of Port I/O is that one can finish things in a single (or a predefined constant number of) bus cycle \\- no need to worry about the dangers of DRAM timings.\n* In more advanced (well, since two decades ago) systems, there are newer types of bus systems. For example, ISA, PCI, AGP, PCMCIA ... SCSI, ATA, SAS, SATA, FC\\-AL ...\n\n---\n\nNow, with so many uncertainties being raised about \"the computer system that is being discussed\", you can understand why you won't get a clear answer for your question.\n\n*Yes, I know that it comes from a textbook. You have a copy. I don't. (Not at home \\- there's one in the office, though.) Therefore, if you need an answer, you will need to show some diagrams and explain what your computer's bus system looks like.*\n\n---\n\nAt the very bottom line, though:\n\n* A DMA is a programmable device. That is, the CPU has the ultimate responsibility of *telling* the DMA what to do. Of course, during the time slot where the DMA takes over the system, the CPU will cooperate by letting the DMA run the show.\n* Under the control of the CPU (and the OS that runs it), a DMA has the ability to take over control for *one or more bus (plural)* in order to facilitate the transfer of data from the disk controller to the main memory.\n* During the timeframe where the DMA takes over the bus (plural), the DMA will issue commands over that bus \\- i.e. in place of its usual controller, i.e. the DMA pretends it is doing the CPU's work.\n* If the data transfer involves two different bus, the DMA may have to do this to different bus.\n* To be able to move a number of bytes (words, etc), the DMA contains a loop counter for keeping track of the remaining amount of data to be copied.\n* To be able to write to the main memory, the DMA contains a memory address register, which is programmable by the CPU, so that the CPU can tell the DMA where to write the data to.\n* Depending on the system's bus design, the DMA may or may not have to deal with the gruesome detail of DRAM timing cycles.\n* Once upon a time, some time after DMA has been invented, some peripheral devices start to pre\\-package DMA onto their controllers \\- this is called **Bus Mastering**. Still, whether the DMA sits on the CPU package, the motherboard, or the I/O card, it must be ultimately under the control (programming) of the CPU, because they must somehow negotiate access to the system bus (plural), and the main memory.\n* Modern computer systems have a dedicated subsystem called the DRAM Controller. If there is one, it is almost certainty that this DRAM Controller will also fulfill the functionality of DMA, that is, it looks like it's a programmable \"byte copying loop\", and all of the aforementioned complexity is hidden inside the silicon of the DRAM Controller.\n\n---\n\nIf you find it very confusing \\- I find it confusing too \\- you will need diagrams. Lots of diagrams. System diagrams. Bus diagrams. Timing diagrams. State transition diagrams. etc.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a computer system with DMA, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the role and functionality of the DMA controller?\n\nA) The DMA controller directly reads data from the disk and writes it to main memory without any involvement from the disk controller.\n\nB) The DMA controller programs the disk controller to transfer data directly to main memory, eliminating the need for the DMA controller to be involved in the actual data transfer.\n\nC) The DMA controller takes over the system bus, issues commands to the disk controller to read data into its buffer, then initiates the transfer of that data from the disk controller's buffer to main memory.\n\nD) The DMA controller simply notifies the CPU when data is ready to be transferred, and the CPU then handles the actual data movement from the disk controller to main memory.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately describes the role and functionality of the DMA controller in a typical DMA operation. The DMA controller does not directly read from the disk (ruling out A), nor does it program the disk controller to transfer data directly to memory without its involvement (ruling out B). While the CPU is involved in initially programming the DMA controller, it does not handle the actual data movement during a DMA transfer (ruling out D).\n\nThe DMA controller takes control of the system bus, coordinates with the disk controller to ensure data is ready in its buffer, and then manages the transfer of that data from the disk controller's buffer to main memory. This process allows for efficient data transfer without constant CPU intervention, which is the primary purpose of DMA."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/16", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/345337", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/169512/"], "docs_id": 345337, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOgab.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOgab.jpg)\n\nIn the previous FM receiver, how does the left transistor amplify the input radio signal from the antenna at the collector and output it at the base, from what i know the base always has a smaller current than the collector.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Does it help you to see this symmetric oscillator when re\\-drawn this way?:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NeGHQ.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fNeGHQ.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\n I think the antenna could likely go on either side of the LC resonant circuit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the FM receiver circuit shown, what is the primary function of the left transistor in relation to the input radio signal from the antenna?\n\nA) It acts as a voltage amplifier, increasing the amplitude of the signal\nB) It functions as a super-regenerative detector, enhancing sensitivity\nC) It serves as an oscillator, generating a local frequency\nD) It operates as an impedance matcher between the antenna and the tuned circuit\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The circuit shown is a symmetric oscillator, often used in FM receivers as a super-regenerative detector. The left transistor, in conjunction with the right transistor, forms an oscillator circuit. Its primary function is not to amplify the input signal in a conventional sense, but to generate a local oscillation that interacts with the incoming radio signal.\n\nThe oscillator operates at a frequency close to the received signal frequency. This local oscillation mixes with the incoming signal, creating a beat frequency that can be more easily detected and processed.

The \"ghost\" images of moving objects in satellite imagery are primarily caused by the overlapping of multiple images taken at slightly different times.

How can I take into account days with no values such as weekends and holidays?\n\nThanks in advance for your help :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ACF and PACF can be used to determine the autoregressive and the moving\\-average orders of an ARMA model. It will be easy in cases of pure AR or pure MA model, i.e. either ARMA($p$,0\\) or ARMA(0,$q$). (You should be able to find detailed examples in a time series textbook or elsewhere on Cross Validated.) Meanwhile, the order of an ARMA model with both $p$ and $q$ being nonzero may be difficult to read just from ACF and PACF.\n\nI doubt that `auto.arima` indeed systematically tends to overfit. The algorithm behind the function has been empirically proven to work alright in many cases. For example, it delivers relatively high forecast accuracy on the M competition dataset consisting of some 3000 time series with their characteristics varying a lot. Also, note that you can choose between AICc (default), AIC and BIC for model selection in `auto.arima`. AICc will be optimized for forecasting, but BIC may be more suitable if you want the model selection to be consistent (I intentionally put it a little vaguely because the topic of AIC against BIC is too wide to cover here; you may see, for example, Burnham \\& Anderson [\"Multimodel Inference: Understanding AIC and BIC in Model Selection\"](http://smr.sagepub.com/content/33/2/261.short)).\n\nIf you are modelling stock prices, there is little chance they will be anything else than a random walk, i.e. ARIMA(0,1,0\\), plus perhaps a GARCH\\-type pattern in the variance of the series. Also, there should be no seasonality in stock prices so you do not need to adjust for day\\-of\\-the\\-week effects; hence, you can just delete the days with no observations. However, if you take a long enough period, there might be some cycles and `auto.arima` might deliver something else than ARIMA(0,1,0\\). But from the subject\\-matter perspective it would be quite problematic for the stock prices to exhibit systematic patterns and to be predictable.

See [this blog for discussion](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/test-the-interface-not-the-implementation). \n\nThe op then proposed returning the number of added rules. But as far as I can tell it will always return 1\\. Even if the method did return varying values, you'd only be testing the values it returned, not the actual functionality you are interested in.\n\nSo how do you test this method? Firstly, don't think of it in terms of how to test that method. Instead, think about what behavior you want to test. Don't think about the internal state, or how it does it. Think about how the method will be used in the rest of your program.\n\nPresumably, you want to be able to do something like this:\n\n```\nvalidator.addErrorRule('foobar', function(payload) {\n   if (payload.cost > 50) {\n        return \"No. Price Too High\";\n   }\n});\nvalidation_results = validator.validate(payload)\n\n```\n\nAll we need in order to turn that into a test is to say:\n\n```\nassert.deepEqual(validation_results, [\n    {validator: 'foobar', error: 'No. Price Too High'}\n])\n\n```\n\nThis actually tests the functionality we care about and avoids introducing implementation details. \n\nMany coders have gotten the idea that they need to test each method independently. That's why people think they need to test `addErrorRule` separately from `validate`. Don't fall into this trap. Methods within the same object are usually tightly interconnected and attempting to test them independently is a fool's errand. Furthermore, you miss out on testing the interaction between the methods which is usually the entire point of the functionality you wanted."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When unit testing a validation system with methods like addErrorRule and validate, which approach is most appropriate?\n\nA) Expose the internal validationRules object and directly test its state after calling addErrorRule\nB) Modify addValidationRule to return the number of rules added and test this return value\nC) Test addErrorRule and validate methods separately to ensure each works independently\nD) Test the overall behavior by adding rules and then calling validate, asserting the expected validation results\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A involves testing implementation details, which is generally discouraged as it can make tests brittle and resistant to refactoring. \nOption B focuses on an arbitrary return value that doesn't truly reflect the desired functionality. \nOption C misses the opportunity to test the interaction between methods, which is often crucial.\nOption D is the best approach as it tests the actual behavior and functionality from the user's perspective, without relying on implementation details.

On my application there are classes that only care for the real output value (regardless if an error is present) and other classes that needs the real value and the proper error code. So, in terms of design I came out with the idea that I need to separate the concept of \"value\" and \"error code\", I came up with 2 options:\n\nReturn value and error code in the same output (client classes will have to know how to interpreter the output value):\n\n```\ndouble Sensor::compute() {\n   double output = compute();\n   return output;\n}\n\n```\n\nor using a structure like to retrieve the output:\n\n```\nstruct SensorOutput {\n   double value;\n   int error_code;\n}\n\n```\n\nso my method could look like:\n\n```\nSensorOutput Sensor::compute() {\n   double output = compute();\n   int errorCode = get_error_code();\n   SensorOutput out;\n   out.value = output;\n   out.error_code = errorCode;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhich one is better in design terms?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, I assume that using exceptions to signal those errors is out of the question (either because you do not wish to use exceptions, or those errors are considered part of the \"normal\" flow of the program for one reason or another).\n\nI would strongly suggest the second approach. If you were to use a `-65500` result as an code to indicate \"there has been error XYZ\" you are actually mixing two separate contexts: The normal result of `Sensor::compute()` and signaling errors. Imagine that \\- due to a change of requirements \\- `Sensor::compute()` suddendly should be able to return negative values... but those are now already reserved for your \"error codes\" \\- and suddently you've got a problem.\n\nAlso you need to sprinkle your code with calls along the line of\n\n```\nif (sensorValue == ERROR_CODE_ABC)\n    //Error handling\nelse if (sensorValue == ERROR_CODE_DEF)\n    //More Error handling\nelse\n    doStuffWithValue(sensorValue);\n\n```\n\nAnd you always risk the possibility of working with an errorCode value instead of a real value, because you missed a spot for a check (new target voltage for the PSU is \\-65500V... ummm, not good).\nAlas, even the second approach cannot free you from this burden entirely \\- you may be able to use more sane/safe values (the sensor has NO\\_POWER, so the measured voltage is 0V), but you still need to check sensorValue.errorCode every time \\- only exceptions would be able to help you out there (if you forget to handle them somewhere, they for terminate the program, instead of letting you work with bogus values, causing hard to track errors)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A sensor system needs to return both measurement values and error codes.

It clearly separates the measurement value from the error code, avoiding the mixing of contexts. This approach allows for future flexibility (e.g., if negative measurements become valid) and reduces the risk of misinterpreting error codes as actual measurements. While option C (using exceptions) can be a good approach in some cases, the question implies that exceptions are not preferred for this scenario.

At that point close firefox down and start it in normal mode to ensure it still runs without freezing and that all Add\\-Ons are indeed disabled.\n\nYour next course of action if this is all working still is to attempt to enable each Add\\-On you have in turn, restarting firefox in between each to identify the Add\\-On which is causing firefox to freeze note it could also be a combination of Add\\-Ons so in the event that enabling only one at a time does not cause the symptoms next try these steps.\n\nAfter running through every Add\\-On singly start enabling all your Add\\-Ons again restarting with each you enable until you produce the freeze, at that point you know that the last one you activated is conflicting with one of the others enabled prior.

Thank you for any hint.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it can be found explicitly, though not in elementary functions but in terms of a combination of elementary and hypergeometric functions.\nThe problem is (almost) equivalent to finding a conformal map\nfrom your straight strip onto the broken strip. For this it is sufficient to find \na conformal map from the upper half\\-plane onto the UPPER half of the broken strip (and then apply the Schwarz Symmetry principle). This map of the upper half\\-plane on the upper half\nof the broken strip is given by the Christoffel\\-Schwarz formula\n$$C\\\\int\\_0^z\\\\zeta^{\\\\beta\\-1}(\\\\zeta\\-T)^{\\-\\\\beta} d\\\\zeta,$$\nwhere $\\\\alpha\\=\\\\pi\\\\beta$. This integral can be explicitly expressed in terms of\nhypergeometric function. I hope these hints are enough to make an explicit computation.\n\nIn a comment you ask about dependence on $T$. Dependence on $T$ is trivial:\nIf $F$ is the conformal mapping corresponding to $T\\=1$, normalized such that\n$F(0\\)\\=0,F(1\\)\\=1,F(\\\\infty\\_j)\\=\\\\infty\\_j, j\\=1,2$ then $TF(z/T)$ is the\nmap corresponding to $T$.\n\nRemark. According to a theorem of Chebyshev, this integral is not an elementary function when $\\\\beta$ is irrational. Therefore I suppose that the solution of\nyour problem is also not an elementary function.\n\nHere are some more detail. Let $T\\=1$. Let $F(z)$ be the integral I wrote above. Then $C$\nis determined from the boundary correspondence: $C\\=1/F(1\\)$. Now \n$$G(z)\\=(\\-\\\\cos(\\\\pi z)\\+1\\)/2$$\nmaps the rectangular half\\-strip onto the upper half\\-plane, $(0,1,\\\\infty)\\\\mapsto (0,1,\\\\infty)$. Therefore \n$$H(z)\\=F(G(z))/F(1\\)$$\nmaps the upper half of the rectilinear strip on the upper half of the slanted strip (both with $T\\=1$). So the solution of the Dirichlet problem (with $T\\=1$) is \n$$\\\\Re(H^{\\-1}(z)).$$\nNot very explicit, of course, since one has to invert the integral $F$. But OK for numerical computation.\n\nRemark 2\\. The integral \n$$B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta):\\=\\\\int\\_0^x\\\\zeta^{\\\\beta\\-1}(1\\-\\\\zeta)^{\\-\\\\beta}d\\\\zeta$$\nis called the incomplete Beta\\-function, and there is even the standard notation\n$$I\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta):\\=\\\\frac{B\\_x(\\\\beta,\\-\\\\beta)}{B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)}\\=F(x)/F(1\\).$$\nTo obtain simple estimates, expand it to the power series:\n$$B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\=\\\\beta^{\\-1}x^\\\\beta\\+\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{\\\\beta(\\\\beta\\+1\\)\\\\ldots(\\\\beta\\+n\\-1\\)}{n!(n\\+\\\\beta)}x^{n\\+\\\\beta}.$$\nThis is sufficient to determine your function on $(0,c)$ with any desired accuracy, unless $c$ is close to $1$. Near $1$ use a similar expansion\ninto powers of $x\\-1$.\n\nFor example, near $0$, $G(x)\\\\sim x^2/4,$ so $$H(x)\\\\sim\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta 4^{\\\\beta}B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)}x^{2\\\\beta},$$\n$H^{\\-1}(x)\\\\sim Cx^{1/(2\\\\beta)}.$ Also notice that the series for $B\\_x$ has\npositive coefficients which simplifies the estimates.\n\nTo obtain a lower estimate, you need the upper estimate to $B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)$. We can write it as\n$$B(x):\\=B\\_x(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\=\\\\beta^{\\-1}x^\\\\beta\\+f(x),$$\nwhere $f$ is increasing (because it is a power series with positive coefficients), and we also know that $B(1\\)\\=B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta),$ therefore\n$f(x)\\<f(1\\)\\=B(\\\\beta,1\\-\\\\beta)\\-1/\\\\beta$.

A language can be implemented in a way so that each method can be directly used as a first class object. This impacts the ABI, calling convention, and linking mechanism, but is not extraordinarily special. Most modern language implementations already attach a lot of metadata to each function.\n\nHowever, the meaning of `object.method` differs substantially between its use in delegate assignment vs its use in simple variable assignment:\n\n* In C\\#, the code `Func<\u2026> m = obj.method; m()` is equivalent to `obj.method()`. That is, a `Func<\u2026>` some kind of object that knows which object it belongs to (i.e. the method is \u201cbound\u201d to a specific object). This is exactly equivalent to a closure. The resulting `Func<\u2026>` must therefore remember both the method and the target object. Since a method may be bound to more than one object, each binding results in a new value.\n* In contrast, `obj.method` in JavaScript merely resolves the method without binding it to an object. We have to do that ourselves: `obj.method()` would be equivalent to `var m = obj.method.bind(obj); m()`. You will see that binding a method to different objects will result in values that are *not equal* to one another, while obviously the unbound method is identical.\n\nIn general, I prefer the C\\# approach, where there is equivalent semantics between `obj.method()` and all available usages of `obj.method`.

This tool asks the user for input\\-output examples and an English description or list of keywords describing the desired manipulation. Then, the tool will search for a program using the library that satisfies the examples. If such a program is simple enough, it will be found and displayed to the user.\n\nA proof\\-of\\-concept demo of the tool was well\\-received by the team developing this library, and they expressed excitement about the public use of this tool once it is completed.\n\nThere are already many questions on Stack Overflow that could be answered with the help of this tool. Such questions have the following properties:\n\n* The question indicates a desire to use the library, either in the text or the tags.\n* The question describes in English what kind of manipulation is desired.\n* The question provides one or more input\\-output examples demonstrating the desired manipulation, or the English description of the desired manipulation is so clear that such an example could easily be constructed.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\nWould it be appropriate to do the following:\n\n1. Manually identify questions with the properties above. (We may attempt to do this step automatically in the future.)\n2. If the question does not provide an input\\-output example, manually create one.\n3. Use the tool to automatically search for an answer to the question.\n4. Automatically post a generated answer (if found) on Stack Overflow.\n\nI anticipate auto\\-generated answers to have the following form (suggestions for improvement are welcome):\n\n> Here is one way of achieving this manipulation:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [code]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> For example, given the inputs\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [representation of the inputs for one example]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> this program will produce the output\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> [representation of the corresponding output]\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> This program uses the following functions from \\[library]:\n> \n> \n> * \\[Link to official documentation for function 1]\n> * \\[Link to official documentation for function 2]\n> * etc.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ---\n> \n> \n> This answer was generated and posted automatically by \\[tool].

However, we expect most generated programs to be understandable by themselves, especially with links to official documentation for all relevant functions.\n\nWhat does the community think about these kinds of auto\\-generated answers? Some possible effects of this include:\n\n* Users of the library become aware of a self\\-help tool that can often answer this class of question within seconds.\n* The tool can provide answers to old questions that have not yet been answered.\n* The tool can produce an answer that complements an existing answer. The auto\\-generated program may be simpler than the existing answer's solution program, and human\\-written answers rarely include links to documentation for all relevant functions.\n* Barring critical bugs in the tool, it is guaranteed to produce a program that matches the input\\-output examples. Sometimes human\\-written answers are not complete because they only solve a simplification of the question.\n* Often human answers propose solutions that involve deprecated functions. The tool can stay up\\-to\\-date with deprecation and new features offered by the library.\n* There is reduced burden on the library developers or other experts to manually answer such questions.\n* The automated system is not available to answer follow\\-up questions posed by the question asker via comments.\n* If the input\\-output example is too simple or ambiguous, the auto\\-generated program might not generalize fully, or it might fail for edge cases. (I will attempt to avoid or clarify such questions when manually identifying questions to process, but mistakes are still possible.)\n* Even though auto\\-generated answers provide a solution program with helpful links to documentation, some might still consider them to be spam.\n\nWhat additional policies should I follow to ensure that the auto\\-generated answers are well\\-received? For example, perhaps it would be better to only process questions without an accepted answer.\n\nPlease keep in mind that manually reviewing every generated answer before posting it is most likely not an option on my end. However, high\\-level human monitoring of the tool's progress is reasonable, e.g., manually investigating negative\\-scored answers and modifying or deleting them if necessary.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis is not a proposal to search Google, or any existing knowledge base, for already\\-written answers.

Listing the server publicly would almost certainly change that, but brings the risk of griefing.\n\nSo my question is: if I simply set the spawn point far enough away from where we have so far built everything (say 5,000,000 blocks away), it would take very long to reach 0,0 even by horse in the nether.

Destroying your stuff isn't the only way to grief your server\n\nAs has already been mentioned in the comments, there are things they could do to slow the whole server down; massive animal farms are an easy way, as would be a large redstone contraption that mostly just triggers a vast amount of block updates every tick. And the worst part is, if someone does try to make something like this, you'll have to actually remove it somehow; just banning the player responsible will leave the source of the lag lying around, with its chunks unloaded, and once another new player shows up and loads those chunks, the griefing will be happening all over again.\n\nAdmittedly, griefers who will do things like this are rarer than people who will just wander over to your place and trash it. And there are ways to prevent it, and/or deal with it after the fact. \n\n* You can use something like [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net/) to directly clean up the situation, even if the server is utterly crippled.\n* You can increase the spawn\\-protection value in your [server.properties](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties) file. Crank it up enough, and all new players will have to wander far enough away before they can do anything that a brand new player won't be loading potentially\\-compromised chunks.\n* You could also turn this around; leave the default spawn at (0,0\\), crank up the spawn protection enough to cover your place and a large surrounding area, and non\\-op players won't be able to damage things inside that radius.\n* You could even go more draconian, and create a wall around the default spawn, inside the spawn protection radius, so new players can't get out of it, then require an op to teleport all new players out after having a brief chat. Most griefers will give up quickly when they can't do anything, but you'll probably also lose a lot of good players if there isn't an op on pretty constantly to greet new people.\n\nUltimately, while isolating yourself from new players might be useful in preventing griefing, it's not a solution on its own.

That device, which is powered by a 9V battery, has a step\\-up circuit to raise the battery voltage to \\+\\- 160V which, in turn, charges a 330uF capacitor. As soon as a command is received from the base, the capacitor is discharged over the solenoid through a relay.\n\nMy concern here is about safety when the shoot is aborted after the capacitor is already charged. I'd like the capacitor to be discharged (not through the solenoid, of course) in a brief time span (let\u00b4s say 30s max), to minimize the risk of an accidental shoot in the case of a circuit failure.\n\nAn obvious choice would be a bleeding resistor in parallel with the capacitor. But to have it discharged in 30s, its value would be:\n\n$$\nR \\= {t \\\\over 5 \\\\times C} \\\\implies\nR \\= {30 \\\\over 5 \\\\times 0\\.00033} \\\\implies\nR \\\\cong 18,182 \\\\Omega\n$$\n\nUsing a resistor with this value would permanently drain:\n\n$$\nI \\= {V \\\\over R} \\\\implies\nI \\= {160 \\\\over 18182} \\\\implies\nI \\\\cong 0\\.009 A\n$$\n\nDue to the step\\-up configuration (which is raising input voltage about 20 times) the input current, in this case, would be \\\\$ 20 \\\\times 0\\.009 \\= 180 mA\\\\$. That much energy would have to be drained only to \"feed\" the bleeding resistor. Considering all the other circuit needs, and the fact that the whole device is powered by a 9V battery, that seens a little too much.\n\nMy next, not so obvious choice, was to connect the bleeding resistor through the NC terminal of another relay, which should be kept open during the capacitor charge. Naturally, that would be power consuming too, but much less than the bleeding resistor being connected directly to the capacitor. Plus, got the bonus of having it being discharged even quicker because, in this case, I could use even smaller resistors.\n\nIn fact, I've assembled a prototype to test this concept and... it failed. Actually, the circuit worked as expected, but a single battery was not enough to power it and I've had to use two batteries in parallel, otherwise, when that additional relay was closed, the voltage supplied dropped so much that the Arduino Nano, which was managing all the fuzz, simply rebooted (forgot to mention his presence before).\n\nTrying to reduce the power drain I disable all the LEDs and adjusted the radio module (a EBYTE LoRa E32\\-91520T) to the minimum transmission power possible, with no success.\n\nMy next choice is to use a solid\\-state device, instead of the relay. That could be a Form B (NC) SSR relay, but they are impossible to find where I live (can\u00b4t find them even on the Internet). Meanwhile I was doing that research I became aware of the Depletion mode MOSFETS, which at first glance should do what I want. Here comes the problem: I did tons of research over the Internet and couldn\u00b4t find a way to wire it up to behave like that, especially because it needs a gate voltage inferior to the Source's voltage to keep it closed. In a matter of fact, there is not so much information about those MOSFETs available, usually more theretical stuff than practical applications.\n\nSo, I've tried to simulate their use on the computer, in dozens of different configurations, even using a pair of then back to back (as I discovered they are used in SSR Form B relays), with no success. Sometimes they even worked closer to the way I expected but the current drain to keep the channel open was bigger than the original relay needed.\n\nI do really feel that the answer to that dilemma is quite simple, just lurking around some corner, so I'm asking the experts for some clarification on that. If the use of a depletion MOSFET is not the best solution here, let me know as well.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is the (almost) full schematic:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJnCi.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJnCi.png)\n\nThe blue squared area is a continuity test. When the user presses a button connecting TEST\\+ and TEST\\-, LED\\_TEST will turn on if there is continuity on the solenoid (which is plugged on OUT\\+ and OUT\\- binding posts). This part of the circuit is powered directly by the battery (the 9V\\_RAW power line).\n\nThe rest of the circuit is the step\\-up boost converter (to the left) and the output relays (to the right).\n\nThe boost converter is switched by Arduino PWM pin 3 (which is configured to 31372\\.55 Hz). The relays are triggered by Arduino's 5 and 7 digital pins.\n\nR6FB and R6FB2 pair is a voltage divider to feedback the output voltage to Arduino\u00b4s analog pin 0\\. Obviously, they could also work as a bleeding resistor, but I had to choose that high value (1MOhm) due to the current constraints I've mentioned above.\n\nThe RELAY and RELAY2 subcircuits are like the following:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZ3CH.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZ3CH.png)\n\nBTW, the relay contacts translate as NF \\= NC and NA \\= NO.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consumer products such as power supplies are not designed to last all that long, and especially are not designed to withstand wide temperature variations (in particular to start or work at low temperatures and not to self\\-destruct at high temperatures). They are often not supplied in housings suitable for industrial use. In some cases (though this does not necessarily apply to power supplies) they have a short design life compared to the expected decade or two for an industrial product.\n\nYou could certainly use an ATX supply in an industrial design if you are willing to work around those problems. I know of military products that use consumer innards and are ruggedized by adding housings and expensive connectors. Naturally the price goes up by an order of magnitude or more.\n\nBrick power supplies are not made in the same quantity as consumer supplies, nor are they subject to the same competitive pressures, but they tend to benefit from the economies of scale in consumer products, otherwise they would be **much** more expensive than they are."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an industrial control system and needs to choose a power supply.

The Memory Address Register (MAR) size cannot be determined solely from the addressability.

However, [the RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-6.5.1) doesn't mention business rules as a reason to throw it:\n\n> The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n\nA business rule doesn't fall under any of those three examples.

Or is there a more appropriate status to return?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a great question, and still highly relevant given the historical context (and seemingly contradictory definitions) of the HTTP return codes. Even among the answers to this question there are conflicting definitions. This can be clarified by moving chronologically.\n\n[RFC 2616](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616) (June 1999\\)\n\n> 10\\.4\\.1 400 Bad Request\n\n> > The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed\n> > syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without\n> > modifications.\n\nAs of this RFC, this status code specifically applied only to syntactically invalid requests. There was a gap in the status codes for semantic validation. Thus, when RFC 4918 came around, a new code was born.\n\n[RFC 4918](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4918) (June 2007\\)\n\n> 11\\.2\\. 422 Unprocessable Entity\n\n> > The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server\n> > understands the content type of the request entity (hence a\n> > 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the\n> > syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)\n> > status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained\n> > instructions. For example, this error condition may occur if an XML\n> > request body contains well\\-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but\n> > semantically erroneous, XML instructions.\n\n422 Unprocessable Entity was created to fill the gap of semantic validation in the original specification of the 4xx status codes. However, **another relevant RFC came about in 2014 which generalized 400 to no longer be specific to syntax**.\n\n[RFC 7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231) (June 2014, explicitly obsoletes RFC 2616\\)\n\n> 6\\.5\\.1\\. 400 Bad Request\n\n> > The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or\n> > will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be\n> > a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request\n> > message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n\nNote that the 422 description says that the reason 400 is inappropriate is because 400 (as of RFC 2616\\) should be returned only for bad request syntax. However, **as of RFC 7231, the strict syntax\\-error definition no longer applies to 400**.\n\nBack to the question at hand: While 422 is technically more specific, given this context, I could see either 400 or 422 being used for semantic validation of API parameters. I'm hesitant to use 422 in my own APIs because the definition of 422 is technically outdated at this point (although I don't know if that's officially recognized anywhere). The article referenced in Fran's answer that encourages the use of 422 was written in 2012, two years before RFC 7231 clarified HTTP 400\\. Just be sure to standardize on one or the other."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A developer is designing a REST API endpoint that takes an integer parameter for the number of items to process.

According to RFC 7231, the 400 (Bad Request) status code has been generalized to cover cases where \"the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.\" This includes semantic validation of parameters, even if they are syntactically correct.\n\nB) While 422 (Unprocessable Entity) was introduced in RFC 4918 to cover semantic errors, its definition is based on the older, more restricted definition of 400 from RFC 2616. RFC 7231 has since broadened the use of 400, making it applicable to this situation.\n\nC) 406 (Not Acceptable) is typically used when the server can't produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined by the client. It's not appropriate for parameter validation.\n\nD) 412 (Precondition Failed) is used when a precondition specified in request headers is not met. It's not suitable for parameter validation in the request body or query string.\n\nWhile both 400 and 422 could potentially be used, 400 is more widely recognized and aligns with the most recent RFC definition.

Based on the provided logs, what is the most likely cause of the persistent installation problems?\n\nA) Corrupted package cache\nB) Conflicting PHP dependencies\nC) Incomplete removal of previous MySQL installation\nD) Insufficient disk space\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe logs show that despite attempts to purge MySQL packages, there are still remnants of a previous installation causing conflicts. This is evidenced by:\n\n1. The error message \"dpkg: error processing package mysql-server-5.7 (--configure): installed mysql-server-5.7 package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1\"\n\n2. The fact that even after purging, the system detects an existing MySQL process: \"ps -ef | grep mysql\" shows a running mysqld process.\n\n3. The error \"E: Internal Error, No file name for mysql-server-5.7:amd64\" when trying to reinstall, suggesting package information inconsistency.\n\nThese symptoms all point to an incomplete removal of the previous MySQL installation, which is preventing a clean reinstall. Option A is unlikely as the package lists are being read successfully. Option B is not the primary issue, as PHP-related packages are only mentioned in passing. Option D is not supported by the evidence, as there's no indication of disk space issues in the logs."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/24", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/19560051", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2886509/"], "docs_id": 19560051, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I write this as ternary form:\n\n```\n  if (localStorage.getItem(\"txt\")) {\n    newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\"));\n  } else {\n    newNote();\n  }\n\n```\n\nThis seems not working:\n\n```\nnewNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") ? localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\") ? newNote();\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To answer to the question:\n\n```\nlocalStorage.getItem(\"txt\")\n  ? newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\"))\n  : newNote();\n\n```\n\nBut honestly I don't see why it should be done in this way, it's less readable. I would just make the `newNote` function in a way where, if the arguments given are `null`, it's like a `newNote()` without arguments. In that case, you can just call:\n\n```\nnewNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\"))\n\n```\n\nWithout any `if` in the main code, and in the `newNote` function:\n\n```\nfunction newNote(text, name) {\n    if (text === null) {\n        // alias to `newNote()`\n    } else {\n        // do whatever with `text` and `name`\n    }\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following JavaScript code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nif (localStorage.getItem(\"txt\")) {\n  newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\"));\n} else {\n  newNote();\n}\n```\n\nWhich of the following options correctly refactors this code to use a ternary operator while maintaining the same functionality?\n\nA) newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") ? localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\") : null);\n\nB) localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") ? newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\")) : newNote();\n\nC) newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") ? localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") : null, localStorage.getItem(\"name\") ? localStorage.getItem(\"name\") : null);\n\nD) localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") && newNote(localStorage.getItem(\"txt\"), localStorage.getItem(\"name\")) || newNote();\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption B is the correct answer because it accurately translates the original if-else statement into a ternary operation. It checks if localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") exists, and if so, it calls newNote() with both \"txt\" and \"name\" parameters. Otherwise, it calls newNote() without parameters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the case where localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") is falsy, and it doesn't call newNote() without parameters in that case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it always calls newNote() with parameters, even when localStorage.getItem(\"txt\") is falsy, which doesn't match the original behavior.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses logical operators (&& and ||) instead of a true ternary operator, which can lead to unexpected behavior in some cases and is less readable.\n\nThe correct ternary form preserves the original logic while making the code more concise."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/25", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110911", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/52533/"], "docs_id": 110911, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As we know, the shell enables the user to run background processes using `&` at the command line's end.

Creating a specific ftp-write group allows for better access control and scalability if more users need similar access in the future.\n3.
