If specified, login is allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized. By default, login is allowed for all users. If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to particular users from particular hosts. The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: `DenyUsers`, `AllowUsers`, `DenyGroups`, and finally `AllowGroups`.\n\nEdit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, and add this to the bottom of it:\n\n```\nAllowUsers git adam@192.168.0.* bob@192.168.0.* cliff@192.168.0.* david@192.168.0.*\n\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work (and this way might actually be cleaner) [you can use the `Match` option](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Limit_access_to_openssh_features_with_the_Match_keyword.html) together with `AllowUsers`:\n\n```\n# This is the default setting (only allow GIT access)\nAllowUsers git \n\n# This is the setting that is ONLY available if you are SSHing from the LAN (allow the listed users)\nMatch Address 192.168.0.*\n    AllowUsers git adam bob cliff dave\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An Ubuntu server in a DMZ hosts Redmine and git repositories.

I have not used R, but I do know say Python and have some experience with learning, linear and non\\-linear. I am trying to understand what does `stepAIC` do here. \n\nIn my understanding, and judging from the documentation, `stepAIC` chooses the best model from the class according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC). As far as I understood, the class of models in my case are linear models that try to predict the `result` column based on all other ones. Now, is this class parametrized in R: in case that were say neural nets, I would think that the class would be parametrized by number of hidden nodes, but in case of a linear model in R I am no sure how the selection is done. Also, I am surprised that for this selection no separation in training and validation is needed: a single dataframe is provided. Perhaps, the split is done under the hood using some default method, but I have not found information about this in the docs.\n\nBottom line: I would be happy if someone told me what exactly is happening under the hood of `stepAIC` in the code above. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's a simple example that illuminates how the stepAIC() function from the MASS package works. \n\n```\n# consider the built-in mtcars data set; select variables of interest \ndata <- mtcars[,c(\"mpg\",\"disp\",\"hp\",\"wt\")]\n\n# examine the first 6 records of the data \nhead(data)\n\n```\n\nThe first 6 records in this example data set are as follows: \n\n```\n> head(data)\n                   mpg disp  hp    wt\nMazda RX4         21.0  160 110 2.620\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0  160 110 2.875\nDatsun 710        22.8  108  93 2.320\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4  258 110 3.215\nHornet Sportabout 18.7  360 175 3.440\nValiant           18.1  225 105 3.460\n\n```\n\nThe example data set includes a total of 32 records, one for each type of car, on the variables:\n\n```\nmpg  Miles/(US) gallon  \ndisp  Displacement (cu.in.)  \nhp  Gross horsepower  \nwt  Weight (1000 lbs)  \n\n```\n\nWe'll use the variable mpg as the response variable and the variables disp, hp and wt as the predictor variables. \n\nThe stepAIC() function performs backward model selection by starting from a \"maximal\" model, which is then trimmed down. \n\nThe \"maximal\" model in our example is given by the commands: \n\n```\nModel1_LM <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = data)\n\nsummary(Model1_LM)\n\n```\n\nThe summary associated with the maximal model is as follows: \n\n```\n>     summary(Model1_LM)\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-3.891 -1.640 -0.172  1.061  5.861 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

If the elimination of a predictor improves the \"maximal\" model, the AIC should become smaller. \n\nIt turns out that when eliminate the predictor disp from the \"maximal\" model, we achieve a smaller AIC (i.e., AIC \\= 63\\.840\\), than the one corresponding to the \"maximal\" model (i.e., AIC \\= 65\\.831\\). This suggests that the \"maximal\" model can be improved by simply discarding disp. The \"improved\" model includes only hp and wt as predictor variables and has an AIC of 63\\.840\\. \n\nWe now repeat the same process as the one described in the paragraph above \\- we start out with the \"improved\" model, eliminate each of the remaining predictors hp and wt in turns from the model and monitor how that impacts the AIC. If the AIC becomes smaller, that means that the eliminated predictor does not contribute much to the model. \n\nIn our example, we cannot reduce the \"improved\" model's AIC by eliminating either hp or wt from the model. In fact, when we eliminate each of these predictor variables from the model, the AIC increases, suggesting the elimination has a detrimental effect on the model. \n\nSo the \"final\" model is the one posted by R when we type the following command: \n\n```\nfit1_LM \n\n```\n\nIn other words, the \"final\" model is:\n\n```\n> fit1_LM \n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ hp + wt, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)           hp           wt  \n   37.22727     -0.03177     -3.87783  \n\n```\n\nThis model includes only hp and wt as predictor variables. We can now examine the summary of the fit of this \"final\" model to our data:\n\n```\nsummary(fit1_LM)\n\n```\n\nThe summary looks like this: \n\n```\n> summary(fit1_LM)\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ hp + wt, data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-3.941 -1.600 -0.182  1.050  5.854 \n\nCoefficients:\n        Estimate Std.

Quite possibly the part being replaced was 128 Mbit simply because the technology steered toward parts of that density and not that the product application actually requires that size of storage.\n\n**Algorithms** that use individual bit level programmability are far more likely to be random access across a smaller storage space than typical large block organized Flash memory devices.\n\n**FRAM Technology** may very well be what you want to take a serious look at.

[robust estimators of scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_measures_of_scale). A notable example is the median absolute deviation which relates to the standard deviation as $\\\\sigma \\= \\\\mathrm{MAD}\\\\cdot1\\.4826$. In a Bayesian framework there exist a number of ways to robustly estimate the *location* of a roughly normal distribution (say a Normal contaminated by outliers), for example, one could assume the data is distributed as a t distribution or Laplace distribution. Now my question:\n\n**What would a Bayesian model for measuring the *scale* of a roughly normal distribution in a robust way be, robust in the same sense as the MAD or similar robust estimators?** \n\nAs is the case with MAD, it would be neat if the Bayesian model could approach the SD of a normal distribution in the case when the distribution of the data actually is normally distributed.\n\n*edit 1:*\n\nA typical example of a model that is robust against contamination/outliers when assuming the data $y\\_i$ is *roughly* normal is using a t distribution like:\n\n$$y\\_i \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{t}(m, s,\\\\nu)$$\n\nWhere $m$ is the mean, $s$ is the scale, and $\\\\nu$ is the degree\\-of\\-freedom. With suitable priors on $m, s$ and $\\\\nu$, $m$ will be an estimate of the mean of $y\\_i$ that will be robust against outliers. However, $s$ will not be a consistent estimate of the SD of $y\\_i$ as $s$ depends on $\\\\nu$. For example, if $\\\\nu$ would be fixed to 4\\.0 and the model above would be fitted to a huge number of samples from a $\\\\mathrm{Norm}(\\\\mu\\=0,\\\\sigma\\=1\\)$ distribution then $s$ would be around 0\\.82\\.

The precise conditions that the likelihood and prior need to satisfy are given in the paper [Bayesian robustness modelling of location and scale parameters](http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/pdf/loc-sca.pdf) by Andrade and O'Hagan (2011\\). \nThe estimates are robust in the sense that a single observation cannot make the estimates arbitrarily large, as demonstrated in figure 2 of the paper.\n\nWhen the data is normally distributed, the SD of the fitted T distribution (for fixed $\\\\nu$) does not match the SD of the generating distribution. But this is easy to fix.\nLet $\\\\sigma$ be the standard deviation of the generating distribution and let $s$ be the standard deviation of the fitted T distribution.\nIf the data is scaled by 2, then from the form of the likelihood we know that $s$ must scale by 2\\.\nThis implies that $s \\= \\\\sigma f(\\\\nu)$ for some fixed function $f$.\nThis function can be computed numerically by simulation from a standard normal.

The webservice has no rest support which is something we do want. It will also never support such a thing in nearby future. Therfore, to achieve this we need to place the rest layer between the soap webservice and our application.\n\nAs we eventually want to move our coldfusion application to a new language we do not want to build the \"layer\" in coldfusion. Therefor the layer can be written in a more future proof language.\n\nHowever, what concerns me about this approach is the extra call needed to retrieve data:\n\nOld: client \\-\\> soap call \\-\\> response\nNew: client \\-\\> rest call \\-\\> soap call \\-\\> response\n\nSo my question is: \n\n* How bad will the extra call be performance\\-wise?\n* Would it be a good idea to cache some of it?\n* Or is our goal better achievable by a different approach?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can solve any computer programming problem with indirection, except too much indirection.\n\nI think I can see your thinking here. You want to move to a new application which will be a client of the web service but you don't want to get any of the old dated ickyness of the web service on your nice new clean application. So you want to protect it by wrapping the old web service in REST. \n\nThis idea may be workable but it also may be tragically flawed. It really depends on how the SOAP web service is designed. REST is more than simply a protocol. It's a style of building a protocol. It may be that your SOAP web service is architected in a way that is incompatible with following that faithfully.\n\nThis nagging concern wont go away until you have this working no matter what I say so I'll show the best way to get this working. For now, forget that the SOAP web service exists.\n\nInstead design the REST service around what you know the application will actually need. Follow all the best REST principles here and don't support everything that you might someday need. Only things regularly used today.\n\nNow with that REST design that can support your applications needs ask yourself: can you map to your SOAP web service in a reasonable way? Adapting might be significant work. But if you can do it you'll have a well designed REST interface to support your application. \n\nOne of my favorite techniques is **let use drive design**. I'm applying it here as a way to let you evaluate how feasible this approach is for your case with minimal effort.\n\nSure performance may take a hit but never guess at how much. Measure how much with the simplest test you can. This approach lets you build that test before you rewrite the whole application.\n\nYou can even do a differential performance test that retrieves the same thing as the above REST test directly through SOAP. Now you can see exactly what your added overhead is costing you just by comparing times. \n\nThis may seem like a fair bit of work but it's work you would have had to do anyway. By putting it up front it lets you settle the issue before doubt about it seeps into the rest of your design.\n\nTo speed testing consider investing time with some client emulating tools that can drive these protocols: Postman, Insomnia, Curl..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to build a REST API layer on top of an existing SOAP web service.

This \"let use drive design\" approach allows for a well-designed REST interface that supports the application's needs without being constrained by the existing SOAP structure. It also enables evaluation of the feasibility and performance impact before fully committing to the new design. Options A and B are less ideal as they may lead to a poorly designed REST API that doesn't fully leverage REST principles. Option D focuses on performance optimization without addressing the fundamental API design, which should be considered first."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/35620", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/2471/"], "docs_id": 35620, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As noted by the title, is nesting types (e.g. enumerated types or structures in a class) considered bad practice or not?

The warning you are receiving is not suggesting you never have a nested type. It is simply indicating that your nested type should use an appropriate access modifier and code location.\n\nIf the nested type is truly only used inside the containing class (i.e. it is an internal data container or status indicator), then set its access modifier to private.\n\nIf the nested type is part of one or more method signatures, then it is not in fact local to the containing class. It represents a message being passed to or from instances of the containing class. In this case, it is arguably better to move the nested type out of the containing class, and give it a more open access modifier such as internal or public.\n\nIn short, the warning appears to be recommending that you make local types private, and shared types should stand alone."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a C# project and receives the following warning from Visual Studio Code Analysis:\n\nWarning 34 CA1034 : Microsoft.Design :\n Do not nest type\n 'ClassName.StructureName'.\n Alternatively, change its\n accessibility so that it is not\n externally visible.\n\nWhich of the following actions would be the most appropriate response to this warning, considering best practices for nested types?\n\nA) Remove all nested types from the project, as they are inherently bad practice.\nB) Ignore the warning, as nested types are always acceptable in object-oriented programming.\nC) Make the nested type private if it's only used within the containing class, or move it outside the class if it's used in method signatures.\nD) Always move nested types outside of their containing classes, regardless of their usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action is to make the nested type private if it's only used within the containing class, or move it outside the class if it's used in method signatures. This approach aligns with the warning's suggestion and follows best practices for nested types. It ensures that truly local types remain encapsulated within their containing class, while types that are part of the class's public interface are appropriately exposed. This maintains good code organization and adheres to the principle of keeping shared types standalone and local types private.\n\nOption A is incorrect because nested types are not inherently bad practice and can be useful in certain situations. Option B is incorrect because ignoring the warning without consideration could lead to poor code organization.

All that happens is that at some point after 14\\.04 was released, the Ubuntu developers say: \"Okay, 14\\.04 has been out for a while and there are a lot of updates. For someone installing 14\\.04 now it's a bit of a bummer to have to install all those updates, so let's create ISOs of 14\\.04 plus all the updates released until now, and call that 14\\.04\\.1\\.\" And then the same happens after that, yielding 14\\.04\\.2, etc.\n\nSo, \"keeping 14\\.04\\.1 but still installing updates\" is a contradiction. If you install from a 14\\.04\\.1 ISO and then install updates, you move towards 14\\.04\\.2, and ultimately you will reach it. You or the vendor of your binary need to find out what exactly causes it to work on a bare 14\\.04\\.1 install but not on a 14\\.04\\.2 one. This was caused by some updates that were installed after 14\\.04\\.1 was installed, and you need to find out which ones so you can block them. Otherwise, they will be installed as part of the normal updates, as well.\n\nOh and for your other questions :\n\n2\\) Not really; it is reasonable to assume that Ubuntu point releases will not break things. Sadly, even the most reasonable assumptions fail sometimes.\n\n3\\) Holding a kernel version is possible and should not break your system.

Their main purpose is to provide a more up-to-date starting point for new installations, reducing the number of updates needed after a fresh install. They do not introduce new features or represent separate maintainable versions. Instead, they are part of the continuous update process.

When two vectors with magnitudes \u1e8b\u2081 and \u1e8b\u2082 are added at an angle \u03b8, the square of the resultant vector's magnitude is given by \u1e8b\u2081\u00b2 + \u1e8b\u2082\u00b2 + 2\u1e8b\u2081\u1e8b\u2082cos(\u03b8).

But still have only half of his amount of workers, which means he's simply outmacroing you on resources, thus capable of teching quicker and getting more units.\n\nWithin 2 minutes, he gained 20 Zerglings and 20 Drones. The only noticeable tech he has at this point is the Banelings Nest and an Evolution Chamber, upgrading his units.\n\nMeanwhile, you upgraded to make Tanks with Siege modes, added a Techlab to your Airport (thus not making units from it) and was upgrading Armor in your Engineering Bay.\n\nA better approach would have been to have out a Medivac as soon as possible and see if you could annoy the Zerg player. This has the advantage that you get to see what he's doing and hopefully take out some Drones in the process. Instead you leave him alone, outmacroing you.\n\n**By 15 mins you decide to attack**\n\nWhile he doubled his amount of Zerglings, got his third expansion up and running, had Overlords checking all other possible expansion areas and making sure you couldn't built there by placing creep. He even got out 15 Muta's.\n\nYou went to his base with the banshees (hence you made the Techlab earlier), but hadn't noticed he already had an Overseer. He already had that one at the 10 minute mark, had you spotted it back then, you could have skipped Banshees altogether. \n\nIn the meantime, you didn't get an expansion nor did you significantly increase your army to match his. You have been protecting your base against air attacks, but those Missile Turrets are 100 minerals a piece and can't be moved. Making Marines with a Medivac would have suited you better, especially on such a large map.\n\n**By the 18 minute mark**\n\nYou decide to pull out, which was probably the worst moment: he just started to transform his Zerglings into Banelings (17\\). Together with his 27(!) Muta's, there was nothing you could do. \n\n**My conclusion**\n\nYes, you made all the right counter units, but you didn't make enough of them to stop him. What should you have done differently? Be more aggressive, make sure you're ahead in something (either units or resources) while not being too far behind on others.\n\nYes, you teched up, but if you have only have 50% of his units and 20% of his resources, those upgrades won't help you one bit!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Terran vs Zerg StarCraft 2 match, a Terran player is struggling against a Zerg opponent who has successfully teched up to Mutalisks.

This led to the Zerg player having a significant economic advantage, with twice as many workers by the 10-minute mark. The lack of map control prevented the Terran from spotting and challenging these expansions when the Zerg was still vulnerable.\n\nWhile the other options mention valid strategies, they are not identified as the most critical mistake. Building Vikings (A) is a reactive strategy that doesn't address the root cause. Upgrades (B) were actually pursued by the Terran but were ineffective due to the resource disparity. The Banshee attack (D) was a symptom of poor information gathering, which stems from the lack of map control.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the importance of map awareness and proactive play in StarCraft 2, especially in the early to mid-game phases against a macro-oriented Zerg opponent."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/11/30", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22643", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4280/"], "docs_id": 22643, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It's not that this doesn't make sense, but it just works out awkward 99% of the time.\n\nOften in 2D graphics rectangles are initialized, stored and manipulated as a pair of points.

In more practical terms, a random variable describes a *data\\-generating process*. When you generate a random data point that is described by the random variable $Y$, the probability distribution of $Y$ describes the probability distribution of values that can result.\n\nYou can think of a \"population\" as an infinite reservoir of values drawn from $Y$. Sampling from a population is analogous to repeatedly drawing new values from $Y$. A sample of size $N$ is a size\\-$N$ collection of individual draws from $Y$.\n\nThe sample is clearly not the same thing as the random variable itself, so we need a different notation for it. Let's call it $s \\= \\\\{y\\_1, y\\_2, \\\\dots, y\\_N \\\\}$. Each $y\\_n$ is a single draw from $Y$. The sample mean is a single number. Let's call it $\\\\bar s$. It is the mean of the sequence $s$, i.e. $\\\\bar s \\= \\\\frac{y\\_1 \\+ y\\_2 \\+ \\\\dots \\+ y\\_N}{N}$.\n\nWe can make an interesting observation here! $N$ independent, identical draws from a random variable $Y$ is the same thing as one draw from each of $N$ independent, identical random variables $Y\\_n$. Now, we can talk about the sample itself as a random variable $S \\= \\\\{ Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N \\\\}$.\n\nNote the difference between\n\n$$\ns \\= \\\\{ y\\_1, \\\\dots, y\\_N \\\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nS \\= \\\\{ Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N \\\\}\n$$\n\n$S$ is random: it is a sequence of random variables. $s$ is not random. It is the realized value of a draw from $S$, i.e. a sequence of realized values of draws from $Y\\_1, \\\\dots, Y\\_N$.\n\nTherefore **the sample mean itself can be restated as a random variable $\\\\bar S$**.\n\nCompare\n\n$$\n\\\\bar s \\= \\\\frac{ y\\_1 \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ y\\_N}{N}\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\\\bar S \\= \\\\frac{ Y\\_1 \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ Y\\_N}{N}\n$$\n\n$\\\\bar s$ is just a number: it is the mean of a sequence of numbers $y\\_1, \\\\cdots, y\\_N$. But $\\\\bar S$ is a random variable! Specifically, it is a *statistic*, a single quantity that is calculated from a sample. The value of a statistic for a specific sample is a realization of the distribution for that statistic.\n\nBeing a random variable, draws from $\\\\bar S$ are described by a probability distribution. The distribution of sample means, across all possible samples, is described by the distribution of $\\\\bar S$. This distribution is the *sampling distribution of the mean*.\n\nWith regard to your first question, you are probably confused between the *random variable $Y$* and the *matrix $Y$*. It is an unfortunate clash in notation that random variables and matrices are both conventionally written with capital letters. It is often mathematically convenient to express samples as matrices, so that you can do linear algebra operations on observed data (to generate estimates from that data, e.g. with ordinary least squares). The matrix $Y$ would be a matrix of observed values. Take care to observe the context, to avoid this confusion.\n\nTo address your 2nd question, there are many ways to derive or describe a sampling distribution. One possible technique is called *resampling*: repeatedly draw samples from a population that is distributed according to $Y$, and measure the sample mean in each of those samples. The distribution of those sample means should follow the sampling distribution of the mean."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An experiment is conducted to study the effects of four factors (X, Y, Z, W) on a response variable.

Larger SS values suggest stronger effects on the response variable. In this case:\n\n- Factors X and Y have the largest SS values (2.66 and 2.45 respectively), indicating they likely have the strongest main effects on the response variable.\n- Factor W has a very small SS (0.01), suggesting it has minimal impact.\n- While interactions are important, their SS values are generally smaller than the main effects of X and Y.\n- Three-way interactions are not provided in the given data, so we cannot make assumptions about their significance.\n- It's incorrect to assume that smaller SS values indicate stronger effects (ruling out option A).\n- Comparing interaction SS directly to main effect SS can be misleading (ruling out option B).\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate interpretation of the given ANOVA results."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/17", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/240053", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/18916/"], "docs_id": 240053, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When you drill open a safe there is a chance of getting an Exceedingly Rare Special Item, according to what it says on the Sputnik Safe and the Crimefest II safe.
