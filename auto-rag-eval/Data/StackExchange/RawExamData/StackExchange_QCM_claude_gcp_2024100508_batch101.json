We can build on that to come to an acceptable solution using [`unicode.ToUpper`](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#ToUpper) on the first **rune** of the string.\n\n```\n    r := []rune(s)\n    r[0] = unicode.ToUpper(r[0])\n    s := string(r)\n\n```\n\nOr with a \"clever\" one\\-liner:\n\n```\n    s := string(append([]rune{unicode.ToUpper(r[0])}, r[1:]...))\n\n```\n\nUnlike strings, rune slices are not immutable, so you can replace the first rune with `ToUpper`, which will take care of non\\-ASCII and/or multi\\-byte code points that do have upper cases (e.g. Russian) and leave alone those that don't (e.g. Asian scripts)\n\n**NOTE:** there is a difference between UPPER case and TITLE case, which is simply explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31770995/difference-between-uppercase-and-titlecase). In short, digraph characters like \u01c4 will have different title case (\u01c5, only first grapheme capitalized) and upper cases (\u01c4, both graphemes capitalized). If you actually need titlecase, use [`unicode.ToTitle`](https://pkg.go.dev/unicode#ToTitle).\n\n**NOTE 2:** converting to/from `string` to `[]rune` involves copying, because you get a mutable slice from an immutable string. Do profile your application if you expect to use it in performance\\-sensitive code.\n\nPlayground: <https://go.dev/play/p/HpCBM7cRflZ>\n\n---\n\nIf you have a sizeable input string where a full rune slice conversion becomes too expensive, you can work around this using a capped [`strings.SplitN`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#SplitN) on some separator, essentially to extract the first word of the text and use only that in the conversion:\n\n```\nsep := \" \"\nss := strings.SplitN(s, sep, 2)\n\nr := []rune(ss[0])\nr[0] = unicode.ToUpper(r[0])\n\ns = string(r) + sep + ss[1])\n\n```\n\nBenchmarking with a \\~30K input string shows a significant difference:\n\n```\ngo test -v -bench=. -benchmem\ngoos: darwin\ngoarch: arm64\npkg: example.com\nBenchmarkRuneConv-10            6376        183691 ns/op      258049 B/op          3 allocs/op\nBenchmarkSplitN-10           1709989           706.1 ns/op      4152 B/op          3 allocs/op\nPASS\nok      example.com 3.477s\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Go, which of the following methods is the most efficient way to capitalize only the first letter of a large string (30K+ characters) while handling Unicode characters correctly?\n\nA) Use strings.Title() function\nB) Convert the entire string to a rune slice, capitalize the first rune, then convert back to string\nC) Use strings.SplitN() to extract the first word, convert it to a rune slice, capitalize the first rune, then concatenate with the rest of the string\nD) Use strings.ToUpper() on the first byte of the string\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) strings.Title() would capitalize the first letter of every word, not just the first letter of the string.\nB) While this method works correctly for Unicode, converting the entire large string to a rune slice is memory-intensive and inefficient for very large strings.\nC) This method is the most efficient for large strings.

It works much like *only* does in this regard, which is another focusing modi\ufb01er.\n\nBut *just* is still considered an adverb here, not an adjective. The same thing happens with *nearly everybody* and *nearly finished*: in both cases, *nearly* is still held to be an adverb even when modifying nouns and pronouns. If this idea seems strange, and I know it may, then this is because \u201cadverb\u201d is a junk\\-yard category that we throw just about everything into when we run out of names for word classes. It\u2019s also because the simple parts of speech we teach third\\-graders in America are too narrow and simplistic for use in more nuanced, precise, and exacting analyses.\n\nBoring technical details follow.\n\n---\n\nBoring Details and References\n=============================\n\nThe *Oxford English Dictionary* allows that *just* can have many possible parts of speech, including not just *noun, adjective, verb, adverb* but also other several others like intensi\ufb01ers and modi\ufb01ers (including focusing modi\ufb01ers) of both words and phrases. This can include nouns and pronouns as well as larger constituents like phrases and clauses.\n\nThe particular use mentioned by BillJ as a focusing modi\ufb01er of arbitrary constituents falls under [OED *just* (adverb), sense 6](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/102192#eid40268469):\n\n> 6.

In weakened sense: neither more nor less than, no other than; simply, merely.  \n> \n> (a) Modifying noun phrases.\n\nIn *just me*, this places the focus on the pronoun *me*.\n\nAnd That\u2019s Not All!\n-------------------\n\nHowever, *just* has many other uses as a would\\-be adverb. [OED *just* (adverb) sense 2](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/102192#eid40267344) shows *just* used as a modi\ufb01er of all of these:\n\n* quanti\ufb01ers; adjectives; adverbs; adverbial clauses and phrases; adverbs introducing a subject or object clause; *as* or *so* with adjectives, adverbs, or quanti\ufb01ers; nouns; noun phrases, noun phrases with *the*; prepositional phrases; pronouns; interrogative pronouns; conjunctions; correlative constructions using *not just*; and temporal clauses.\n\nSpeci\ufb01cally, it says it can modify all these types of things:\n\n> 2. As a modi\ufb01er: exactly, precisely; actually; very closely. Also (now archaic) even just (cf. *even* adv. 5\\).\n> \t* a.

It's the job of the disk's own boot sector to look for a bootable partition.\n\nTo make that work, you should write a Windows MBR to the disk using `ms-sys`:\n\n```\nms-sys --mbr7 /dev/sdb\n\n```\n\n(The Syslinux MBR might also work as an alternative, since it does the same thing: read the partition table and jump to the first bootable partition.)\n\nNext, once the MBR first\\-stage bootloader has found your bootable partition, *that partition* needs to have its own boot sector as well (the VBR), which will know how to find the bootable files (specifically BOOTMGR). I'm not entirely sure if mkfs.ntfs writes a proper one, but ms\\-sys can do it as well:\n\n```\nms-sys --ntfs /dev/sdb1\n\n```\n\n### UEFI mode\n\nUEFI doesn't use boot sectors and doesn't search for the \"bootable\" flag, so there's no point in setting it. Instead, the firmware directly searches for partitions which contain a recognizable filesystem.\n\nMost UEFI systems only support FAT and do not understand NTFS. There are workarounds for this (e.g. UEFI:NTFS that comes with Rufus), but you still need to start with a FAT32 partition \u2013 so might as well use it for everything.\n\n```\nmkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1\n\n```\n\nIf you were doing this with Windows 10, you would run into a problem of the `install.wim` file being too large for FAT32\\.

Using the option `matrix of nodes` then also each cell has a name in the form `<matrix name>-<row>-<column>`.\n\nSince we have a name we can access anchors as `<matrix name>.<anchor>`. But we have to know where these anchors are located. For debugging purposes we can add this code right after the previous `\\matrix` definition:\n\n```\n% debugging purposes\n\\draw[red](m.south west)rectangle(m.north east);\n\n\\foreach \\anchor/\\placement in\n    {north/above,  south/below, east/right, west/left,\n     north west/above, north east/above,\n     south west/below, south east/below}\n     \\draw[shift=(m.\\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)} node[\\placement=0.15cm]{\\scriptsize\\texttt{(m.\\anchor)}};\n\n```\n\nNow the table looks like:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmbqZ.png)\n\nIn the picture there are two notes: they are added with \n\n```\n% Where to put the notes according to what we learnt about matrices\n\\node[below=0.5cm] at (m.south west) {Note};\n\\node[below=0.5cm, align=center,text width=5cm] at (m.south) {Another Note which is supposed to be longer};\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX and TikZ information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about creating the Prisoner's Dilemma table using TikZ is NOT correct?\n\nA) The `matrix of nodes` option in TikZ allows each cell to be named in the format `<matrix name>-<row>-<column>`.\n\nB) The `\\foreach` loop can be used to draw and label the anchor points of the matrix for debugging purposes.\n\nC) The `element/.style` definition is used to set the minimum width and height for all cells in the matrix.\n\nD) The `\\node` command with `rotate=90` is used to create the vertical \"Name 1\" label on the left side of the table.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: The `matrix of nodes` option does allow cells to be named in the format described.\nB is correct: The provided code demonstrates using a `\\foreach` loop to draw and label anchor points.\nC is correct: The `element/.style` is defined with `minimum width` and `minimum height` for all matrix cells.\nD is incorrect: The `\\node` command with `rotate=90` is actually used for the \"Name 2\" label, not \"Name 1\".

The transistor was a 2N3904\\. I had two power supplies, one supplying the 5v rail and a second that I could adjust from 0 volts upwards (they had a common ground). I noticed that I couldn't get the base voltage to go much above 0\\.8 volts. If I pushed up the supply voltage to 5 volts I could get the base voltage to about 0\\.85 volts. I am sure there is a simple explanation but why does the voltage at the base max out at about 0\\.8v no matter what voltage I apply?\n\nI know that the transistor is saturated by the time I get to 0\\.8 volts. \n\nUpdate: I've also now plotted the base voltage as a function of the applied voltage via the 1K resistor.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X8GJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X8GJ.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ltwwq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ltwwq.png)\n\nHaving now read the comments and thought more about this, the explanation seems straight forward. We see from the second graph that at a VBE around 0\\.7 v the curve starts to flatten out, this is of course when the transistor starts to open up and in doing so the BE resistance drops thus holding the VBE voltage constant after that. As others have pointed out this can't go on forever but will eventually start to rise again once the resistance stops dropping. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Any low\\-voltage, low\\-power incandescent bulb can be made to work. The trouble, in 2019, is finding them \\-\\- LED's just work so spectacularly better for making light from battery power, you'll need to dig around to find incandescent bulbs.\n\nIf you can find them, get some low\\-voltage (1\\.5 or 3V) \"grain of wheat\" bulbs.\n\nIf I were going to make a Wein bridge oscillator for production, I think I'd find an alternative to using a light bulb to set the gain. I'd probably use a separate amplitude\\-measuring stage followed by an electronically\\-variable resistor. For that I'd start with an analog multiplier, or perhaps a JFET or a switched\\-capacitor \"resistor\" operating well above my highest intended frequency.

This causes the base-emitter junction resistance to drop significantly. The lowered resistance acts as a voltage divider, maintaining a nearly constant VBE even as higher voltages are applied. This phenomenon is related to the transistor entering saturation, where further increases in base current do not significantly change the collector current. The other options are incorrect: A) describes reverse breakdown, which is not occurring here; C) is the opposite of what's happening, as the transistor is conducting more, not less; D) while collector current does reach a maximum in saturation, this is an effect, not the cause of the VBE limitation."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/479459", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/183459/"], "docs_id": 479459, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to plot the function *x*2(1 \u2212 *x*2) \u2212 *y*2 \\= 0 in LaTeX.\n\nI tried running following code\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[margin=0.5in]{geometry}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\\usepackage{textcomp}\n\n\\usepackage{pgfplots}\n\\pgfplotsset{width=10cm}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n  \\begin{axis}[\n      view={0}{90},\n      no markers,\n    ]\n\n    \\addplot3+[\n      contour gnuplot={\n        levels=0,\n        labels=false,\n      }\n    ]\n    {x^2(1-x^2)-y^2};\n\n  \\end{axis}\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nbut the output is \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/392Hr.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/392Hr.png)\n\nBut should be \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQ6R8.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQ6R8.jpg)\n\nThanks for helping.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGgta.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGgta.png)\n\n@Superuser27 is correct about the missing \\*.

On it is an IC with a pin that is pulled down to ground by a normally open switch. I want to turn on supply to a load when the switch is closed.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQRQC.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fnQRQC.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIt's not possible to modify the switch as it is in a sealed unit. I can only tap into the cable between the pin and the switch. The cable between the switch and ground is common to 2 other switches which take their respective pins low when closed.\n\nThe pin is high at 5V. Battery is a 3S lipo. The load consumes 560 mA at 12V. The load is a set of LEDs, with some circuitry to regulate power and provide some protection.\n\nI don't have any information about the IC, as it is an unlabeled 8 pin package. I measured 1\\.2 mA between the pin and ground when the switch is closed. The IC is supplied 5V, regulated from the same 12V source.\n\nI want to attach something between the pin and switch that will turn the supply of power to the load, when the switch is closed and the pin is taken low.\n\nI gather I need a P\\-Channel enhancement mode MOSFET here. Is this appropriate? If the power supply was a constant 12V, then a Vgss of \\-7V to \\-12V would be good, however the supply voltage may dip a few volts when the switch is closed. I'm struggling to measure how low, it might be as low as 6V. What components should be placed around the MOSFET to support and protect it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That won't work. The pin would have to go up to \\+12 to turn the load fully off, which would more than likely fry whatever is in the black box.\n\nYou can do something like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvN1e.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOvN1e.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nPick a MOSFET with low enough Rds(on) to handle your load with very little dissipation, and that can withstand Vgs of something like \\+/\\-20V. If its Rds(on) is specified at 10V that will allow a bit of drop in the 12V bus.\n\nHow it works: When the input is high (\\+5V) Q2 is turned on via base current through R3 (about 430uA). That pulls the base of Q1 down to 100mV or less, sinking the 1\\.3mA through R2\\. Q1 then turns off allowing the gate of M1 to be pulled up to \\+12V through R1 and M1 turns off, turning the load off.

When the input is high (5V), Q2 turns on, which pulls the base of Q1 low, turning Q1 off. This allows the gate of the P-channel MOSFET (M1) to be pulled high, turning off the load. Conversely, when the input is low, Q1 turns on, pulling the gate of M1 low, which turns on the load. This inversion is necessary because a P-channel MOSFET turns on with a low gate voltage relative to its source.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signal amplification is not the main function here. Option C is incorrect as Q1 is not providing a constant current source. Option D is incorrect because while the circuit does offer some protection, this is not the primary purpose of Q1 specifically."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/27", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/158453", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/60305/"], "docs_id": 158453, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Both here on stack overflow and on Java Effective it is suggested that strategy design patterns should be stateless. In fact in the book it is also suggested to make each strategy object a singleton.\n\nThe problem I have is that some strategies I envision for my program need states/fields. Either because they are path\\-dependent in their behavior or because I want them heterogeneous (a statistical distribution of similar strategies, if you prefer).   \n\nThis forces me to break both Java Effective suggestions: I instantiate a new strategy for each user class AND each of these strategies contain its own fields.   \n\nIs that very bad? Should it be done differently?\n\nIt was suggested to me to keep the fields that make the strategy heterogeneous in the class that uses it and then pass it as an argument. I find that very anti\\-oo. Those fields don't belong to the user class. In fact, if that class uses another strategy it might not need those fields at all. That seems to run against the reason I am using the strategy pattern in the first place.   \n\nMostly I am just very confused\n\n---\n\nI make a simple example here. Imagine you have a class Gambler, which represents somebody making bets on horses. Now this class will require a strategy predictStrategy that will work something like this:\n\n```\ninterface predictStrategy{\n    public Horse predictWinningHorse(HorseRace r);\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, I can have many implementations where the strategy is to choose at random, or pick the white horse or whatever. That's easy.   \n\nImagine though that I implement a strategy that looks at past predictions and somewhat \"learns\" from its past mistakes. Clearly each strategy will have to have its own memory on which to learn. I might have to add one more method to the interface (or make an extension)\n\n```\ninterface predictStrategy{\n    public Horse predictWinningHorse(HorseRace r);\n\n    public void addObservation(HorseRace r, Horse oldPrediction, Horse actualWinner);\n}\n\n```\n\nSo that the Gambler class calls \"strategy.addObservation(...)\" at the end of each race to improve its predictive power.  \n\nCan this be **really** be done with a *stateless* strategy object? It seems impossible to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would argue that each instance should remain stateless once it is constructed, i.e., it should not maintain extra state across invocations that changes based on the parameters. A classic example is a tax calculator.\n\n```\ninterface TaxCalculator {\n    /**\n     * Calculates the tax for the given purchase price and shipping charges.\n     * All values are in pennies to avoid rounding.\n     *\n     * @param subtotal total price of all items ordered\n     * @param shipping cost of shipping the order\n     * @return calculated tax\n     */\n    int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping);\n}\n\nclass NoTax implements TaxCalculator {\n    public int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\nclass FixedPercentOfSubtotal implements TaxCalculator {\n    private final int ratePercent;\n\n    public FixedPercentOfSubtotal(int ratePercent) {\n        this.ratePercent = ratePercent;\n    }\n\n    public int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping) {\n        return subtotal * ratePercent / 100;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhile `FixedPercentOfSubtotal` has a member (state), it's provided at construction time and never changes. You could store one instance per state, making them quasi\\-singletons.\n\n**Update**\n\nNeither the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) nor this [Strategy Pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StrategyPattern) page make any stipulation that implementations should not maintain state across calls. It's less common because strategies are designed to be interchangeable and pluggable at runtime, but I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nHowever, that you needed to add a new method to enable that one strategy implementation is a red flag. Other implementations may not need it. Will you define it in the interface anyway? It may make more sense to have the historical\\-tracking strategy implement `RaceListener` and add it to the race track instance. This would allow it to be shared among multiple users as a singleton."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a strategy pattern implementation for a tax calculation system. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the state of strategy objects in this context?\n\nA) Strategy objects should always be completely stateless to adhere to best practices.\n\nB) Strategy objects can never have any fields or maintain any state between method calls.\n\nC) Strategy objects can have state, but it should be immutable and set at construction time.\n\nD) Strategy objects should always be singletons to ensure statelessness.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. As demonstrated in the StackExchange example, strategy objects can have state (fields), but this state should ideally be immutable and set when the object is constructed. This approach allows for different configurations of a strategy while maintaining thread-safety and avoiding unexpected behavior from mutable state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while statelessness is often desirable, it's not an absolute requirement for strategy objects. The example shows a valid use case for state in the FixedPercentOfSubtotal class.\n\nOption B is too restrictive. As shown in the example, strategy objects can have fields (state), but they should be carefully managed.\n\nOption C correctly captures the idea presented in the example, where the FixedPercentOfSubtotal class has a rate field that is set at construction and never changes.\n\nOption D is incorrect.

Waterfall1 is a process model. Iterative methodologies are process models. They don't specify how to do things, but outline the types of things that are done and sequencing for things. For example, Waterfall identifies the phases that a project goes through \\- requirements, design, implementation/unit testing, integration testing, system testing, deployment \\- without saying what artifacts to produce or what tools to use (although the output of code is implied). Agile defines core values in the form of [the Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), time\\-boxed iterations, and continuous response to change, but it doesn't say how long your iterations should be or how you go about responding to change. The [Spiral model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) is a third software process model.\n\nA software process methodology is a specific way of conducting a software project. These are things like the Rational Unified Process and Scrum. They define exactly what, when, and/or how various artifacts are produced. They might not be entirely explicit with all regards \\- for example, Scrum doesn't identify what documents to produce or not to produce, since it's focus is on delivering value to the customer \\- but they define, in some way, the actions that members of the project team must deliver.\n\nHowever, in actuality, the point is often moot. Many times, process methodologies are presented as frameworks in which you tailor to the needs of your customer and development team, based on requirements and resources. On top of this, organizations might deal with regulatory or legal guidelines that dictate certain aspects of what must be produced or how to go about performing certain tasks (especially related to verification and validation activities).\n\nIt frequently becomes more important to discuss each team or organization's process in terms of plan\\-driven versus agile or amount of formality and ceremony. Discussing the terminology difference between a \"process model\" and a \"process methodology\" is mostly useful during academic discussions of process models.\n\n---\n\n1 I'm referring to the traditionally taught Waterfall, not the more explicitly defined Waterfall in Winston Royce's paper."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between a software process model and a software process methodology?\n\nA) A software process model is more specific than a software process methodology, detailing exact artifacts and timelines.\n\nB) A software process methodology is an abstract representation, while a software process model provides concrete implementation details.\n\nC) A software process model is an abstract representation of a process, while a software process methodology is a specific way of conducting a software project.\n\nD) There is no significant difference between a software process model and a software process methodology in practical applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

However, we need to decide if \u201cwomen('s)\u201d in \u201cwomen('s) clothes\u201d is a possessive noun or a nominal premodifier or attributive noun functioning as an adjective, \u201cwomen\u201d, whose head is \u201cclothes\u201d. A Wikipedia page states that fluent English speakers will regard the use of \"women clothes\" as solecistic (\\=grammatically incorrect) in this context. \n\nIt seems that, when asked, native English speakers will prefer reading \u201cwomen's clothes\u201d in a department store while non\\-native English speakers will prefer \u201cwomen clothes\u201d. Whilst native English speakers seem to process \u201cwomen's\u201d as a possessive noun establishing a relationship between \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cclothes\u201d, non\\-native speakers believe that the clitic would be omitted in \u201cwomen's\u201d as \u201cwomen\u201d is considered by them a premodifying attributive noun functioning as an adjective \u2013 e.g. \u201cclothes which have been ***designed for women***\u201d. There are other constructions which seem to be problematic such as \u201cwomen's range\u201d, \u201cwomen's clothing\u201d, \u201cwomen's clothes magazine\u201d. \n\nThe question is: if the clothes have been designed for women and they do not belong to them yet, could we say \"women's clothes\"? Wouldn't \"women clothes\" be more suitable here? If not, why? \n\nIn **\"Find out what women's clothes were like in the 19th century\"**, I believe \"women's clothes\" is the right construction here as those were the clothes worn or used by women in the 19th century.

This usage is similar to other constructions like \"a mile's distance\" or \"Obama's administration,\" where the 's doesn't indicate literal ownership but rather defines or characterizes the following noun. Option A is incorrect because the clothes in a store are not owned by women yet. Option B, while partially true, doesn't fully capture the grammatical function of the 's.

Usually everything that *can* be omitted is omitted. Here there is no ambiguity, so the verb does not convey any extra information, so the verb can be omitted, so the verb usually is omitted.\n\nHere are some cases where the verb would be kept because it conveys some information.\n\n> It is usually said that Indians were often arrested in the 19th century, but studies show that this not true. Mainlanders are actually more likely to be arrested now than native Indians were \\[then].\n\nHere the verb *were* indicates that the statement is about how likely Indians were to be arrested in the 19th century, not about how likely that would be now. If the sentence was just \u201c\u2026 than native Indians\u201d, then it would be ambiguous whether it was referring to Indians being arrested now or Indians being arrested in the 19th century. Adding \u201cthen\u201d at the end is optional, but the sentence sounds better with it, to remind the reader why the past tense is used (because it refers to a time that was previously mentioned).\n\n> Mainlanders were actually more likely to see ghosts than native Indians were.\n\nHere the verb \u201cwere\u201d indicates that the sentence is about Indians seeing ghosts, not about mainlanders seeing Indians (which is what the sentence would mean without \u201cwere\u201d)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the sentence \"Mainlanders were actually more likely to be arrested than native Indians,\" which of the following best explains why the verb \"were\" is typically omitted after \"Indians\"?\n\nA) The omission of \"were\" is grammatically incorrect and should always be included.\nB) The verb is unnecessary because it doesn't provide any additional information in this context.\nC) Omitting \"were\" changes the meaning of the sentence to compare mainlanders to Indians rather than arrest rates.\nD) The verb must be included to maintain proper parallel structure in the sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, in English, elements that can be omitted without causing ambiguity or losing information are usually left out. In this case, the verb \"were\" after \"native Indians\" doesn't provide any extra information or clarification, so it's commonly omitted for conciseness. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the omission is actually grammatically acceptable and common. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the meaning of the sentence remains clear even without \"were.\" \n\nOption D is incorrect because while parallel structure is important in some constructions, in this case, the omission of \"were\" is acceptable and doesn't violate parallel structure rules.\n\nThe documentation notes that there are specific cases where including \"were\" would be necessary to avoid ambiguity or to convey additional temporal information, but in the given sentence, its omission is both correct and more common in everyday usage."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/01/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/524210", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/12370/"], "docs_id": 524210, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to use `pgfplots` to plot a `groupplot` who's width (8 cm), font family (Arial), and font sizes (10pt for the axis labels, 8pt for the tick labels) are specific. \n\nI've tried `tikzscale` to get the dimension of the figure right.

Which of the following approaches would be most effective for achieving this goal?\n\nA) Use ReforgeLite addon with the combat rogue preset and follow its recommendations without considering other tools.\n\nB) Rely solely on askmrrobot.com for gear optimization and ignore SimulationCraft results.\n\nC) Use SimulationCraft results in conjunction with an addon like ReforgeLite or askmrrobot.com, adjusting settings based on simulation data for optimal performance.\n\nD) Turn on elective mode in the game options to freely assign skills from any category to skill slots.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to use SimulationCraft results in combination with other tools like ReforgeLite or askmrrobot.com. This allows the player to make informed decisions about gear optimization based on accurate simulation data. Simply using preset configurations or relying on a single tool may not provide optimal results, as evidenced by the user's experience of losing DPS when following ReforgeLite's preset recommendations. By using SimulationCraft data to guide the settings in reforging tools, the player can achieve maximum DPS potential for their character.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it relies solely on preset configurations without considering SimulationCraft data. Option B ignores the valuable information provided by SimulationCraft. Option D is unrelated to DPS optimization through gear reforging and is actually advice for a different game (Diablo III)."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/03", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/149211", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/65770/"], "docs_id": 149211, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can you speed up Minecraft FPS without using these two solutions: Optifine \\& Settings?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As the previous answer said, you can assign more RAM to your Minecraft (DO NOT assign all of your RAM to it, that can overload your computer), but you can also enable Advanced OpenGL.

They're also widely used in numerical applications. But I've just tested the examples above for small $\\\\epsilon$ using SciPy and got incorrect results.\n\nSo my question is, how do numerical analysts get around this problem? Or why is this apparently not a problem?\n\nI could venture some guesses: While finding eigenvectors of general matrices may be impossible, it *is* possible to find their eigenvalues. Also, it's possible to \"shift\" a problematic matrix by some small $\\\\epsilon$ so that its eigendecomposition is computable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The singular value decomposition, when applied to a real symmetric matrix $A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\lambda\\_i(A) u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$, computes a stable mathematical object (spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\lambda\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$, which is a [projection\\-valued measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-valued_measure)) using a partially unstable coordinate system (the eigenvalues $\\\\lambda\\_i(A)$ and eigenvectors $u\\_i(A)$; the eigenvalues are stable, but the eigenvectors are not). The numerical instability of the latter reflects the [coordinate singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_singularity) of this coordinate system, but does not contradict the stability of the former. But in numerical computations we have to use the latter rather than the former, because standard computer languages have built\\-in data representations for numbers and vectors, but usually do not have built\\-in data representations for projection\\-valued measures.\n\nAn analogy is with floating\\-point arithmetic. The operation of multiplication of two floating point numbers (expressed in binary $x \\= \\\\sum\\_i a\\_i(x) 2^{\\-i}$ or decimal $x \\= \\\\sum\\_i b\\_i(x) 10^{\\-i}$) is a stable (i.e., continuous) operation on the abstract real numbers ${\\\\bf R}$, but when viewed in a binary or decimal representation system becomes \"uncomputable\". For instance, the square of $1\\.414213\\\\dots$ could be either $1\\.99999\\\\dots$ or $2\\.0000\\\\dots$, depending on exactly what is going on in the $\\\\dots$; hence questions such as \"what is the first digit of the square of $1\\.414213\\\\dots$\" are uncomputable. But this is an artefact of the [numeral representation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) used and is not an indicator of any lack of stability or computability for any actual computational\nproblem that involves the abstract real numbers (rather than an artificial problem that is sensitive to the choice of numeral representation used). In contrast, floating point division when the denominator is near zero is a true singularity; regardless of what numeral system one uses, this operation is genuinely discontinuous (in a dramatic fashion) on the abstract reals and generates actual instabilities that cannot be explained away as mere coordinate singularity artefacts.\n\nReturning back to matrices, whereas the individual eigenvectors $u\\_i(A)$ of a real symmetric matrix $A$ are not uniquely defined (there is a choice of sign for $u\\_i(A)$, even when there are no repeated eigenvalues) or continuously dependent on $A$, the spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A :\\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\lambda\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$ is unambiguous; it is the unique projection\\-valued measure for which one has the functional calculus\n$$ f(A) \\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\bf R} f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$$\nfor any polynomial $f$ (or indeed for any continuous function $f \\\\colon {\\\\bf R} \\\\to {\\\\bf R}$). The spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A$ depends continuously on $A$ in the [vague topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vague_topology); indeed one has the inequality\n$$ \\\\\\| f(A) \\- f(B) \\\\\\|\\_F \\\\leq \\\\\\|f\\\\\\|\\_\\\\text{Lip} \\\\\\|A\\-B\\\\\\|\\_F$$\nfor any real symmetric $A,B$ and any Lipschitz $f$, where $\\\\\\|\\\\\\|\\_F$ denotes the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm) (also known as the Hilbert\\-Schmidt norm or 2\\-Schatten norm). This allows for the possibility for stable computation of this measure, and indeed standard algorithms such as tridiagonalisation methods using (for instance) the QR factorisation and Householder reflections do allow one to compute this measure in a numerically stable fashion (e.g., small roundoff errors only lead to small variations in any test $\\\\int\\_{\\\\bf R} f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$ of the spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A$ against a given test function $f$), although actually demonstrating this stability rigorously for a given numerical SVD algorithm does require a non\\-trivial amount of effort.\n\nThe practical upshot of this is that if one uses a numerically stable SVD algorithm to compute a quantity that can be expressed as a numerically stable function of the spectral measure (e.g., the inverse $A^{\\-1}$, assuming that the spectrum is bounded away from zero), then the computation will be stable, despite the fact that the representation of this spectral measure in eigenvalue/eigenvector form may contain coordinate instabilities. In examples involving eigenvalue collision such as the one you provided in your post, the eigenvectors can change dramatically (while the eigenvalues remains stable), but when the time comes to apply the SVD to compute a stable quantity such as the inverse $A^{\\-1}$, these dramatic changes \"miraculously\" cancel each other out and the algorithm becomes numerically stable again. (This is analogous to how a stable floating point arithmetic computation (avoiding division by very small denominators) applied to an input $x \\= 1\\.99999\\\\dots$ and an input $x' \\= 2\\.00000\\\\dots$ will lead to outcomes that are very close to each other (as abstract real numbers), even though all the digits in the representations of $x$ and $x'$ are completely different; the changes in digits \"cancel each other out\" at the end of the day.)\n\n\\[The situation is a bit more interesting when applying the SVD to a non\\-symmetric matrix $A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\sigma\\_i(A) u\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$. Now one gets two spectral measures, $\\\\mu\\_{(A^\\* A)^{1/2}} \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} v\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$ and $\\\\mu\\_{(AA^\\*)^{1/2}} \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) u\\_i(A)^T$ which are numerically stable, but these don't capture the full strength of the SVD (for instance, they are not sufficient for computing $A^{\\-1}$). The non\\-projection\\-valued spectral measure $\\\\mu\\_A \\= \\\\sum\\_i \\\\delta\\_{\\\\sigma\\_i(A)} u\\_i(A) v\\_i(A)^T$ does capture the full SVD in this case, but is only stable using the vague topology on the open half\\-line $(0,\\+\\\\infty)$, that is to say $\\\\int\\_0^\\\\infty f(E)\\\\ d\\\\mu\\_A(E)$ varies continuously with $A$ as long as $f$ is a test function compactly supported in $(0,\\+\\\\infty)$, but is unstable if tested by functions that do not vanish at the origin. This is ultimately due to a genuine singularity in the [polar decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_decomposition) of a non\\-selfadjoint matrix when the matrix becomes singular, which in one dimension is simply the familiar singularity in the polar decomposition of a complex number near the origin.]"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real symmetric matrix A.

Conditioning on X does not make X constant. Or am I missing something? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two scenarios exist. From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation):\n\n> Depending on the nature of the conditioning, the conditional expectation can be either a random variable itself or a fixed value.\n\n* If the experimenter cannot control the values of $X$ (the majority of cases in observational studies), the conditional expectation is a random variable because it is a function of a random variable (i.e. $X$).\n* If the experimenter can control the $X$, $\\\\mathbb{E}(Y\\\\mid X)$ is no longer a random variable because $X$ is known.\n\nNotice being known is different from being observed, after all you can observe realisations of a random variable.

On the other hand, if the intended goal is to match some \"correctness\" norm, then it doesn't matter whether it's clear.\n\nThe issue is ***taken***, which is, as noted, a participial adjective. That identification, however, doesn't mean that\n it behaves like an adjective, nor that it originated as an adjective. \n\nIn fact, *taken* is the remains of the deceased passive relative clause *which were taken*, and that in turn is the remains of the active relative clause *which `Agent` took* (where `Agent` represents whoever took the radiograms, which may or may not be relevant, and may or may not be explained elsewhere in the paper). Passive and then Whiz\\-Deletion have applied, leaving only the single word *taken*, which has not had time to shed its verbish habits and resists moving to a prenominal adjective position. \n\nTo avoid such problems, my advice is not to delete so much. Viz.\n\n* *In order to illustrate the necessity of some steps, we use a bad representative of the radiograms that we took.*\n\nNotes:\n\n1. ***Steps*** are presumably steps in some process, which is described elsewhere; this would be a good place to remind the reader \\-\\- e.g, *steps in the treatment process* or whatever. This also separates the bare NP *steps* from what follows.\n2. Preposed adverbial clauses are followed by a ***comma***. This represents the intonation contour with which they are pronounced, and signals the reader that there **is** a preposed adverbial clause here (even though some of its markers, like *In order*, have been deleted).\n3. There is no reason (besides a possible technical style sheet) to use the passive ***taken*** when the Agent can be identified as an active subject. Here I have identified it with the authors, as Principal Investigators, which may be wrong; but it should be identified if it's possibly relevant, and this is a good place to do it. Plus, it simplifies the grammar, again.\n4. Likewise, the authors are identified as the ones using the bad samples for illustration in an active main clause *we use*, rather than a passive ***is used***.\n\nI have nothing against Passive constructions, and they are useful.

The field current and field flux increase.\n* as the the voltage increases to the setpoint, the regulator solenoid opens the upper D\\+ contact. This decreases the field current to only that provided by the resistor.\n\nSo at low RPM the solenoid will cycle field between D\\+ and open. This will regulate to a low\\-limit voltage.\n\nNow increase the RPM:\n\n* a further increase in voltage pulls the solenoid down more and closes lower contact, shorting out the field coil through GND. The field flux and current decrease.\n* as the voltage drops again, the solenoid de\\-energizes and the contacts open.\n\nSo at high RPM the solenoid cycles the field coil between GND (short) and the resistor. This will regulate to a high\\-limit voltage.\n\nEither way, the regulator solenoid is 'buzzing' back and forth, chopping the field coil drive to maintain the voltage by setting an average field flux.\n\nFinally, the battery overcurrent / undervoltage cut\\-out isn't part of the regulator; those are done inside the generator itself.

He should be fixing this alone and paying for any plumbing issues. This could end up being something that could cost you a few thousand dollars or more if you are in a city. There is a chance that not only do you have grout (cement) blocking one section but it could be layering your whole line on the bottom. Which you think might not be a huge issue if there is a 1/2 inch grout on a 4 inch pipe but this will build up constantly, especially if it isn't PVC.\n\nThere is very little you can do other than replace the pipes. You can try [liquid hammer](http://www.sbsconcreteproducts.com/liquid-hammer.html). My guys use this to clean their wheel barrows and tools from concrete and it really works. However I am not sure it is suitable for pipes. But really what do you have to lose? I would contact the manufacturer of liquid hammer and ask them if you can pour it down a drain legally and what effect it will have on those pipes (my guess is your pipes will last). Then pour if it is legal and see if first if your main clog is gone and then later if there are no issues with your main line. Since it is your house you can monitor if the concrete is causing buildup on main line, and then repeat cleansing or having plumber come out with a bit to break it up."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner discovers a wet patch on their bathroom ceiling and water under the vapor barrier in the attic.

The event horizon is the edge of the black hole. You are far away from the event horizon, and a chain is passing you by fast heading toward the black hole. Due to the size of the black hole and the makeup of the chain, the chain will not break before reaching the event horizon.\n\nAfter a while, the following scene happens:\n\n[![Image 2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5nw6J.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5nw6J.png)\n\nAs the end of the chain approaches the event horizon, the chain slows down due to the immense gravity as it approaches a frozen state.\n\nAs I show in the diagram, you can observe this phenomenon as well as observe the chain moving fast by you toward the black hole.\n\nAs for my question..\n[![Photo 3](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLwkN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLwkN.png)\n\nHow can the part of the chain near you appear to be moving quickly toward the black hole, while the end near the black hole is frozen (or close to it)? Where does all that chain go?\n\nLet me ask the same question in another way..\n\n[![Image 4](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l4gYB.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l4gYB.png)\n\nIf the distance between you and the black hole is 1000 units, and the chain appears to be almost frozen 1000 units away from you, how could you reconcile watching 10000 units of chain speed past you? How does that 10000 units appear to fit within a distance of 1000 units from your perspective?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would like to add something that the other answers don't address. Redshift.\n\nYour question is a tricky one because you from the observer's view cannot have a moving chain and a frozen chain at the same time.\n\n> Arbitrarily close hovering observers will never see anything cross the horizon because of the extreme redshift\n\n[When looking for a black hole, will we always find a collapsing star instead?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/496050/when-looking-for-a-black-hole-will-we-always-find-a-collapsing-star-instead/496068#496068)\n\nThe answer to your question is extreme redshift. Not only is there extreme time dilation at the horizon, but also extreme redshift. So the links that are closest to the horizon will disappear because the photons coming from them are redshifted so that we cannot detect them any more.\n\nSo there is no discrepancy, the observer sees the chain moving, and the links that are closest to the horizon will disappear (because the photons coming from them are redshifted so that we cannot detect them)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An observer watches a long chain falling into a black hole.

As the chain approaches the event horizon of the black hole, the light emitted from the links closest to the horizon experiences extreme redshift. This means that the photons from these links are shifted to such long wavelengths that they become undetectable to the observer. \n\nWhile time dilation (A) does occur near a black hole, it doesn't fully explain why the observer doesn't see a contradiction in the chain's movement. Gravitational lensing (B) can distort the appearance of objects near a black hole but doesn't address the apparent freezing effect. Quantum entanglement (D) is not relevant to this macroscopic scenario.\n\nThe extreme redshift effectively causes the links closest to the event horizon to \"disappear\" from the observer's view, resolving the apparent paradox of a rapidly moving chain that seems to freeze near the black hole. This allows the observer to see the chain continuously moving towards the black hole without seeing a buildup of frozen links near the event horizon."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/30", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73358", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/24992/"], "docs_id": 73358, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our Mac is broken and we are contemplating not replacing it.

Here's why:\n\n1. Mokalsium in Diamond is correct, as milk bonuses are very powerful and Mokalsium's effect is amplified in the Diamond slot.\n2. Holobore in Ruby provides a significant base CPS increase, which is beneficial for idle play.\n3. Jeremy in Jade also contributes to CPS increase, making it a good choice for the third slot.\n\nOption A is suboptimal because Skruuia doesn't actually increase CPS during idle play; it only affects wrinkler pops, which isn't frequent in AFK play.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Skruuia shouldn't be permanently slotted, and Rigidel's effect only works while the game is open, making it less useful for AFK play.\n\nOption D is wrong because Rigidel in Diamond is wasted for AFK play, and Mokalsium is most effective in the Diamond slot, not Jade."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/23", "source": ["https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/481", "https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4021/"], "docs_id": 481, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been seeing some (1\\) [pretty](https://magento.stackexchange.com/posts/53078/revisions) (2\\) [strange](https://magento.stackexchange.com/posts/53065/revisions) (3\\) [edits](https://magento.stackexchange.com/posts/53063/revisions) popping up.\n\nWhat is the purpose behind these?

Let $\\\\vec{u}$ and $\\\\vec{v}$ be the unit vectors in the direction of $\\\\vec{bc}$ and $\\\\vec{ba}$, respectively. We have\n$$\\\\angle dba \\+ \\\\angle dbc \\= \\\\pi \\\\iff \\\\cos(\\\\angle dba)\\+\\\\cos(\\\\angle dbc)\\=0\\\\iff \\\\vec{u}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{bd}\\+\\\\vec{v}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{bd}\\=0$$\n$$\\\\iff (\\\\vec{u}\\+\\\\vec{v})\\\\cdot \\\\vec{bd}\\=0$$\nBut the line $\\\\vec{u}\\+\\\\vec{v}$ is the internal angle bisector of $\\\\angle abc$ so this is precisely the plane orthogonal to that passing through $b$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a tetrahedron ABCD where triangle ABC lies in the xy-plane and D is the apex with a positive z-coordinate. Which of the following statements correctly describes the locus of points D for which the sum of the non-base face angles incident to B (\u2220DBA + \u2220DBC) equals \u03c0?\n\nA) It is a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane.\nB) It is a vertical plane that bisects the angle ABC and meets the xy-plane in a line where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nC) It is a sphere centered at point B.\nD) It is a cone with its apex at point B.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The locus of points D satisfying the condition forms a vertical plane (parallel to the z-axis) that bisects the angle ABC. This plane intersects the xy-plane in a line L, which has the property that the angle of incidence between AB and L is equal to the angle of reflection between BC and L. This is due to the fact that the sum of the face angles being \u03c0 implies that the vector sum of unit vectors along BA and BC is perpendicular to BD, which is precisely the condition for the internal angle bisector of angle ABC.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the locus is not a horizontal plane. Option C is incorrect as the locus is not a sphere. Option D is incorrect because the locus is not a conical surface."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/07", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/16349", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/526/"], "docs_id": 16349, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The site runs Magento CE 1\\.7\\.0\\.2\\.\n\nCustomers have been reporting issues with logging in.

The problem appears to be related to cookie handling, particularly with the domain. By explicitly setting the Cookie Domain to match the website's domain (www.foobar.com), it ensures consistent cookie behavior across different browsers and prevents issues with cookie deletion or mismatching domains. This solution directly addresses the observed problem with the \"deleted\" cookie for the .www.foobar.com domain, while maintaining the correct cookie for www.foobar.com. The other options, while related to cookie settings, do not specifically target the domain issue that seems to be at the root of the login problems."}}
