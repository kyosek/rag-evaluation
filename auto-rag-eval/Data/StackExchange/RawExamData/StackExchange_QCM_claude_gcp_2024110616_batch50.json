The statement is indeed false, and the student's counterexample (x=0, y=\u221a2) effectively disproves it. This is because 0/\u221a2 = 0, which is rational, contradicting the claim that x/y would be irrational.\n\nThe confusion arises from two key points:\n1. The contrapositive of a false statement can be true. In this case, the contrapositive \"For all rational x and real y, if x/y is rational, then y is rational\" is actually true.\n2. The student's error was in assuming that for a fraction to be rational, both numerator and denominator must be integers. This is not necessarily true, as rational numbers can be expressed as ratios of integers in their simplest form.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of logical implications, the relationship between a statement and its contrapositive, and the precise definitions of rational and irrational numbers.

If you don't have the proper tools and/or knowledge, it's often best to let the professionals handle maintenance and repair.*\n\nGas Furnace Ignition Sequence:\n==============================\n\n1. Thermostat calls for heat.\n2. Pilot gas valve opens.\n3. Ignition control starts (spark or glow).\n4. Pilot gas ignites.\n5. Flame sensor detects pilot flame.\n6. Main gas valve opens.\n7. Main burners ignite.\n8. Blower timer starts.\n9. Flame sensor detects main burner flame.\n10.

Vacuum switch detects negative pressure.\n4. Pilot valve opens.\n5. Ignition control starts (spark or glow).\n6. Pilot gas ignites.\n7. Flame sensor detects pilot flame.\n8. Main gas valve opens.\n9. Main burners ignite.\n10. Blower timer starts.\n11. Flame sensor detects main burner flame.\n12. Blower starts.\n\nIgnition Problems:\n==================\n\nVacuum Switch Not Closing\n-------------------------\n\nIn a high efficiency furnace, if the vacuum switch does not close after a certain timeout. The furnace will shut down, then possibly retry a few times depending on model. If after a given number of tries the switch still does not close, the furnace will enter lock out. Once in lock out, the furnace has to be manually reset (depending on model).\n\nThe vacuum switch will look something like this...\n\n![Vacuum switch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JuyoF.jpg)\n\nAnd will have a rubber tube connecting it to the draft inducer. This part cannot be repaired, and must be replaced if it's faulty.\n\nPilot Not Igniting\n------------------\n\nIf the pilot does not light, you'll first want to check to make sure there is something trying to ignite it. Typically a spark or glow ignitor is used, so first you'll want to determine which is being used.\n\n### Glow Ignitor\n\nA glow ignitor looks similar to this, though may not be visible without further disassembly.\n\n![Glow ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3OVd.jpg)\n\nIt works by passing a current through it, causing it to heat up and glow. It should heat up enough to ignite the pilot gas. If it doesn't heat up, it should be replaced.\n\n### Spark Ignitor\n\nA spark ignitor looks like this.\n\n![Spark Ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KugBz.jpg)\n\nTake notice of the thick, often orange or red wire that is typically used to connect the ignitor to the ignition control module. This device works by generating an electrical arc between the two probes, causing the pilot gas to ignite. If there is no spark, you'll have to replace the ignition control module and/or the ignitor itself. If the [ignitor is not igniting the gas](https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/32529/33), but there is a spark. You can try cleaning the electrodes with fine steel wool, to remove any carbon buildup.\n\nPilot Not Proving\n-----------------\n\nFor a pilot to \"prove\", it simply means that the flame sensor has sensed the pilot flame. If there is no pilot or the sensor doesn't detect it, the furnace will often purge the system and then try again. Furnaces will often try a set number of times, before entering lock out.\n\nIf you can see the pilot flame, but the sensor is not detecting it. Try gently cleaning the sensor with fine steel wool, to remove any built up carbon. Also make sure the sensor is in the proper location with respect to the flame (Check the owners manual for proper placement), and adjust as necessary. If that doesn't work, replace the sensor.\n\nMain Burner Not Proving\n-----------------------\n\nIf the main burner ignites, but the furnace shuts down before the blower starts. You'll want to check the main flame (or rollout, high limit, etc) sensor(s). If your furnace has error code indicators, check those and compare to the owners manual for translation. In this case, you'll want to test and/or replace each sensor and/or contact an HVAC technician"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about furnace ignition issues, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner reports that their high-efficiency gas furnace attempts to start multiple times before successfully igniting, but only during early morning hours. The furnace operates normally at other times. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this intermittent issue?\n\nA) A faulty vacuum switch that's affected by cooler overnight temperatures\nB) Carbon buildup on the flame sensor reducing its sensitivity\nC) A glow ignitor that's nearing the end of its lifespan\nD) Condensation in the exhaust system affecting the draft inducer's performance\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and consideration of real-world factors. The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. The problem occurs only in early morning hours, suggesting an environmental factor is at play. Cooler overnight temperatures can lead to increased condensation in the exhaust system.\n\n2. High-efficiency furnaces, as mentioned in the documentation, use a draft inducer as part of their ignition sequence. This component is sensitive to proper exhaust flow.\n\n3. Condensation in the exhaust system can temporarily obstruct the flow, affecting the draft inducer's ability to create the necessary negative pressure. This would prevent the vacuum switch from closing, which is a critical step in the ignition sequence.\n\n4. As the day progresses and temperatures rise, the condensation likely evaporates, allowing normal operation at other times.\n\n5. The furnace attempts multiple starts before succeeding, which aligns with the behavior described when the vacuum switch doesn't close promptly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while temperature could affect a vacuum switch, it's unlikely to cause such a specific time-based issue. Option B is plausible but wouldn't explain the time-specific nature of the problem. Option C is incorrect because a failing glow ignitor would typically show consistent problems, not just in the morning. Option D best integrates multiple concepts from the documentation (high-efficiency furnace design, vacuum switch function, and ignition sequence) with real-world factors (condensation due to temperature changes), requiring critical thinking to arrive at the most likely cause."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/859446", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/423417/"], "docs_id": 859446, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have 2 forests \\- domainA.com and domainB.net.

What does it intuitively mean? If one is to explain this to their child how would one go about it?\n\nIt's a concept that I have difficulty in articulating \\- especially when relating variance to risk. I understand it mathematically and can explain it that way too. But when explaining real world phenomena how do you make one understand variance and it's applicability in the 'real world', so to speak.\n\nLet's say we are simulating an investment in a stock using random numbers (rolling a die or using an excel sheet, doesn't matter). We get some 'return on investment' by associating each instance of the random variable to 'some change' in the return. Eg.: \n\n> Rolling a 1 implies a change of 0\\.8 per \\\\$1 in investment, a 5 a change of 1\\.1 per \\\\$1 and so on.\n\nNow if this simulation is run for about 50 times (or 20 or 100\\) we will get some values and the final value of the investment. So what does 'variance' actually tell us if we were to calculate it from the above data set? What does one \"see\" \\- If the variance turns out to be 1\\.7654 or 0\\.88765 or 5\\.2342 what does this even mean? What did/can I observe about this investment?? What conclusions can I draw \\- in lay man terms.\n\nPlease feel free to augment the question with that for standard deviation too! Although I feel it's 'easier' to understand, but something that would contribute to making it also 'intuitively' clear would be greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would probably use a similar analogy to the one I've learned to give 'laypeople' when introducing the concept of bias and variance: the dartboard analogy. See below:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YuksA.png)\n\nThe particular image above is from [Encyclopedia of Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8), and the reference within the image is [Moore and McCabe's \"Introduction to the Practice of Statistics\"](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Introduction_to_the_Practice_of_Statisti.html?id=6qJpAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y).\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nHere's an exercise that I believe is pretty intuitive: Take a deck of cards (out of the box), and drop the deck from a height of about 1 foot. Ask your child to pick up the cards and return them to you. Then, instead of dropping the deck, toss it as high as you can and let the cards fall to the ground. Ask your child to pick up the cards and return them to you.\n\nThe relative fun they have during the two trials should give them an intuitive feel for variance :)"}, "answer": "Understood. I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about variance and standard deviation. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A financial advisor is explaining the concept of investment risk to a client using a dice-rolling simulation for stock returns. After 100 simulations, two investments A and B show the following characteristics:\n\nInvestment A: Average return = 8%, Variance = 4\nInvestment B: Average return = 8%, Variance = 16\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the risk profile of these investments and the implications for the client's decision-making?\n\nA) Investment A is less risky, and the client should always choose it over Investment B due to its lower variance.\nB) Investment B is more likely to outperform Investment A in the long run due to its higher variance.\nC) Investment A and B have the same risk profile because they have the same average return.\nD) Investment B has a wider range of possible outcomes, which could mean higher potential gains but also larger potential losses compared to Investment A.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of variance in a real-world financial context, requiring analysis and application of the concept. The correct answer is D because it accurately describes the implications of the different variances while maintaining the same average return.\n\nVariance measures the spread of data points around the mean. In this case, both investments have the same average return (8%), but Investment B has a higher variance (16 vs. 4). This means that the outcomes for Investment B are more spread out from the average.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Investment A is indeed less risky, it's not always the best choice. The appropriate investment depends on the client's risk tolerance and goals.\n\nOption B is a common misconception. Higher variance doesn't necessarily mean better long-term performance; it just indicates more volatility.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it confuses average return with risk profile. Two investments can have the same average return but very different risk profiles due to different variances.\n\nOption D correctly captures the essence of what variance represents in this context. The higher variance of Investment B indicates a wider range of possible outcomes, which could result in higher gains but also larger losses compared to the more stable Investment A. This explanation aligns with the real-world application of variance in risk assessment and helps the client understand the trade-offs between potential reward and risk."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/10", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/185225", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/5577/"], "docs_id": 185225, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: please add this record to the parcel if you have found it or you found it \n\nI think both tenses are ok in this case but for me the first version is better because it has an impact on the present situation .

So I'm pretty keen to hear a proper description of what \"Edge Traversal\" does!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It looks like this [Microsoft patent filing](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090007251.pdf) from earlier this year might tell you what you want to know.\n\nFrom what I can gather, this flag allows firewall rules to apply to traffic that has been encapsulated by, for example, an IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel originating outside the border of the network. As patents often are, this one is written in such a generic manner as to apply to any different type of tunneling protocol, from what I can tell.\n\nThe payload of this encapsulated traffic would be opaque to the any firewall at the network on the other end of the tunnel. Presumably, these encapsulated packets would be passed through unfiltered to the internal host where the other end of the tunnel terminated. That host would receive the traffic, pass it through its own firewall, decapsulate the traffic (if allowed by its own firewall), and pass the decapsulated packets back its firewall. When the packet travels thru the firewall the second time (after decapsulation), it has an \"this packet traversed the network edge\" bit set such that only rules with the \"edge traversal\" bit also set will apply to the packet.\n\nFigure 4 of that patent application appears to describe the process graphically, and the \"Detailed Descriptions\" section beginning on page 7 describes the process in painfully specific detail.\n\nThis basically permits a host\\-based firewall to have different rules for traffic that came in via a tunnel thru the local network's firewall, as opposed to traffic that was just sent unencapsulated by a tunnel directly through the local network's firewall.\n\nI wonder if the iptables \"mark\" functionality would be prior art to this patent? It certainly seems like it does a very similiar thing, albeit in an even more generic fashion (since you can write user\\-land code to \"mark\" packets for virtually any reason if you want to )."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Edge Traversal in Windows Firewall, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A company has implemented a complex network infrastructure with multiple layers of NAT and VPN tunnels.

Based on the patent filing mentioned in the documentation, this feature is particularly useful for scenarios where traffic is encapsulated, such as IPv6 packets tunneled through IPv4 networks.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because:\n1. It directly relates to the core functionality of Edge Traversal, which is handling encapsulated traffic that has traversed network boundaries.\n2. IPv6-to-IPv4 tunneling is explicitly mentioned in the patent as an example use case.\n3. This scenario involves traffic that would be opaque to intermediate firewalls, requiring special handling at the endpoint.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simple NAT traversal for RDP doesn't require the complex handling provided by Edge Traversal.\nOption B is incorrect as Edge Traversal is not primarily about improving performance, but about enabling connectivity in complex network topologies.\nOption D is incorrect because Edge Traversal is focused on inbound traffic handling, not outbound filtering based on user identity.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (NAT, tunneling, IPv6/IPv4 transition) and applies them to a real-world scenario, testing the candidate's ability to analyze a complex network situation and identify the most appropriate use of the Edge Traversal feature."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/29", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/59941", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/13981/"], "docs_id": 59941, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many books on differential geometry develop the geometry in the setting of principal bundles or moving frames. But when it comes the time to do riemannian geometry they leave all that nice machinery and just talk about the Riemann tensor, sectional curvature, Jacobi's equation and the first and second variations of engergy. \n\nSo, isn't there a way to tackle the classic problems in global riemannian geometry (for example the theorems that one can see in do Carmo's book) with Cartan's methods using moving frames? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Moving frames and differential forms are primarily useful for exact formal pointwise computations involving local differential invariants of a geometric structure (such as a Riemannian metric) and proving theorems that follow from such computations. An example might be the uniqueness of Riemannian metrics with constant sectional curvature. An impressive amount of differential geometry can be studied in this way, as shown in the work of Elie Cartan, S. S. Chern (see, for example, his papers generalizing Gauss\\-Bonnet and constructing Chern classes), and Robert Bryant.\n\nThe approach is less useful when working globally or semiglobally and when studying geometric inequalities rather than exact identities. The power of studying Jacobi fields along geodesics lies in the comparison theorems that originate in Sturm\\-Liouville theory. Here, formal computations are needed only to reduce the original geometric setup to a self\\-adjoint linear second order ODE, and the computations are best done with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal frame of vector fields (parallel along geodesics). The Cartan differential form approach is less convenient here.\n\nThe same is true when considering variational formulas for various energy integrals that are useful in differential geometry. It is possible to do the computation using differential forms and the formula for the Lie derivative, but for most of us find it more natural to work with vector fields and/or local co\\-ordinates when doing these computations.\n\nThe upshot, as I have already said elsewhere, is that I find it quite handy to be able to do computations using any of the different approaches and choose the one that feels most comfortable at any given moment."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is studying the global properties of a complex Riemannian manifold.

The correct answer, B, can be proven using the character table of Sn, as mentioned in the documentation.

Why does the pattern match work?**\n\nExample file `input.txt`:\n\n```\nhead1,head2,head3\na,b,c\nb,no a in first field,c\na,\"with quotes\",c\na,\"with ,\",c\nb,a,1\na,\"with\n newline\",c\nb,1,a\n\n```\n\nRecord selection via `awk` with exact string before introducing NUL works:\n\n```\n$awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS=\",\"} {if ($1==\"a\") print}' input.txt\n\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\na,b,c\na,\"with quotes\",c\na,\"with ,\",c\na,\"with\n\n```\n\nIntroducing NUL and correcting \"newline\\-splits\" works (note the `\"with\\n newline\"` entry):\n\n```\n$sed -e 's/$/\\x00/' -e 's/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/' input.txt | cat -A\n\nhead1,head2,head3^@$\na,b,c^@$\nb,no a in first field,c^@$\na,\"with quotes\",c^@$\na,\"with ,\",c^@$\nb,a,1^@$\na,\"with$\n newline\",c^@$\nb,1,a^@$\n\n```\n\nUsing a pattern match for a in field 1 works (note how `\"a\"` in other fields fails, but `\"head1\"` matches):\n\n```\n$sed -e 's/$/\\x00/' -e 's/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/' input.txt |\nawk 'BEGIN {RS=ORS=\"\\x00\" ; FS=OFS=\",\"}\n     { if ($1~\"a\") print}' |\ncat -A\n\nhead1,head2,head3^@$\na,b,c^@$\na,\"with quotes\",c^@$\na,\"with ,\",c^@$\na,\"with$\n newline\",c^@\n\n```\n\n**HOWEVER**: the exact match for `\"a\"` in field 1 fails:\n\n```\nsed -e 's/$/\\x00/' -e 's/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/' input.txt |\nawk 'BEGIN {RS=ORS=\"\\x00\" ; FS=OFS=\",\"} { if ($1==\"a\") print}' \n\n##<no output>##\n\n```\n\nWhere am I wrong? Why does is work before using NUL as `RS`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your sed command is not changing newlines (`\\n`) to NULs (`\\0`) but to NULs \\+ newlines (`\\0\\n`) (as `cat -A` shows).\n\nWhen using GNU awk with RS set to `\\0`, the first character of a subsequent record (and of its first field) will be `\\n`, which will break your exact match.\n\nAnd the `'s/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/'` newline\\-splits correction doesn't change that at all \\-\\- it just appends the  `newline\",c` record to the previous one.\n\n---\n\nA quick and dirty \"solution\" is to set `RS` to `\\0\\n` instead of just `\\0`. But that way of massaging csv files so that they can be parsed by awk is not reliable, so you should REALLY find something better.\n\nWith your last example:\n\n```\nsed -e 's/$/\\x00/' -e 's/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/' input.txt |\ngawk 'BEGIN {RS=ORS=\"\\x00\\n\" ; FS=OFS=\",\"} { if ($1==\"a\") print}' | cat -A\na,b,c^@$\na,\"with quotes\",c^@$\na,\"with ,\",c^@$\na,\"with$\n newline\",c^@$\n\n```\n\n```\nsed -e 's/$/\\x00/' -e 's/\\(,\"[^,\"]*\\)\\x00/\\1/' input.txt |\ngawk 'BEGIN {RS=\"\\x00\\n\" ; FS=OFS=\",\"} { if ($1==\"a\") print}'\na,b,c\na,\"with quotes\",c\na,\"with ,\",c\na,\"with\n newline\",c\n\n```"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data analyst is working with a CSV file containing customer feedback, where some fields include newline characters within quoted strings. They attempt to process this file using awk with a NUL character as the record separator. Despite their efforts, they encounter unexpected behavior when trying to match the first field exactly. Which of the following best explains the root cause of this issue and provides the most appropriate solution?\n\nA) The sed command is adding both a NUL and a newline character at the end of each record, causing awk to include the newline in the first field and breaking exact matches. The solution is to use RS=\"\\x00\\n\" in awk.\n\nB) The awk command is not properly recognizing the NUL character as a record separator. The solution is to use the -v option to explicitly set RS=\"\\0\" in awk.\n\nC) The sed command is incorrectly handling quoted fields with newlines, causing data corruption. The solution is to use a CSV-aware parser instead of sed and awk.\n\nD) The awk command is interpreting the NUL character as part of the field data rather than a separator. The solution is to use a different character, such as \"|\", as the record separator.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue lies in how the sed command is modifying the input file. As explained in the top answer, the sed command is not simply replacing newlines with NUL characters, but instead appending NUL characters to the end of each line, resulting in a NUL followed by a newline (\\0\\n) as the actual record separator.\n\nWhen awk is configured with RS=\"\\x00\", it correctly identifies the NUL as the record separator but leaves the newline character at the beginning of each record. This newline becomes part of the first field, causing exact matches to fail.\n\nThe solution proposed in option A, using RS=\"\\x00\\n\" in awk, addresses this specific issue by treating the NUL-newline combination as the record separator. This allows awk to correctly process the records without including the extraneous newline in the first field.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this approach is described as a \"quick and dirty\" solution in the documentation. For more robust handling of CSV files with complex data, including newlines within quoted fields, a dedicated CSV parser would be more appropriate and reliable.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (sed processing, awk record separators, and CSV parsing challenges), applies them to a real-world scenario of data processing, and tests critical thinking about the interactions between different text processing tools rather than simple memorization."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/25", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/133066", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/52882/"], "docs_id": 133066, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As in, a word signifying 'a little' \\- used in common vernacular in England, and possibly elsewhere. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As Barrie and Peter have already stated, the OED and Etymonline leave it as being perhaps from Scots *smitch*, without further clarifying what that is or where it comes from. With no authoritarian clues to guide us, I will indulge in some unfounded (but, I think, reasonable) speculation:\n\nMy personal guess would be that this is one of a group of words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic (since my knowledge of Scottish is quite rudimentary, I\u2019ll refer only to the Irish forms here\u2014it\u2019s quite a safe bet that most, if not all, of these also exist in some form or other in Scottish) that refer to something seen as tiny and insignificant, either something verbal or a physical object.\n\nThese words all start with *sm\\-* plus a vowel usually either /\u026a/ or /\u0250\\~\u0259/ and one more consonant. Most of the words are monosyllabic, with this consonant being then final, but some have an extra syllable, usually /\u0259/, /\u0259\u027e/, or /\u0259\u026b/ (these are all common nominal endings and are not part of the root of the word\u2014the latter two are non\\-productive diminutives).

It causes a preceding consonant\u2014i.e., the final consonant in the root or the final r/l in the suffix, if there is one\u2014to become slender if it isn\u2019t already (see [Irish phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_phonology#Consonants) for what broad and slender consonants are). Sometimes, this slenderisation is continued backwards to the root\\-final consonant even if there is a suffix, but not always; similarly, the schwa in the *\\-al/\\-ar* suffixes is sometimes deleted, sometimes not.\n\nAll the words listed above can be turned into diminutives very easily with this suffix, and quite a few of them would either coincide in Irish or be so similar that they would certainly coincide if borrowed into English:\n\n> *Smiog* \\> ***smig\u00edn***; *smiogal* \\> ***smiogail\u00edn/smigil\u00edn/smigl\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smid* and *smioda* \\> ***smid\u00edn***; *smaid* \\> ***smaid\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smiodar* and *smeadar* \\> ***smidir\u00edn*** (or sometimes *smidr\u00edn*)  \n> \n> *Smiot* \\> ***smit\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smut*, *smuta*, and *smuit* \\> ***smuit\u00edn***\n\nOf these, a few are common enough to have entered the dictionaries: *smidir\u00edn* \u2018tiny piece/scrap/fragment\u2019 (this is the source of the English word \u2018smithereens\u2019, as in \u2018blow something to smithereens\u2019); and *smit\u00edn* \u2018rap, smart blow as with a stump of wood\u2019.\n\nOf the others, I myself have certainly heard people using *smid\u00edn* and *smuit\u00edn* in regular speech in Irish to refer to little scraps of paper, pieces of dust, flecks of paints, specks of dandruff, smudges\u2014things like that.\n\nMy guess would be that \u2018smidgen\u2019 (and perhaps also \u2018smudge\u2019) in English comes from one or more of these diminutives and their source words. Both \u2018smidgen\u2019 and \u2018smudge\u2019 appear to have existed originally both with a final /d\u0292/ and a final /t\u0283/, which fits perfectly with being from a mixture of these words that also vacillate between final d and final t.\n\nIt appears from a bit of Googling that [this Reader\u2019s Digest PDF](http://media.rd.com/rd/consumer_marketing/Ultimate-Word-Power.pdf) gives a similar etymology, so I\u2019m not the first to advance this theory after all, it seems."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the word \"smidgen\" and its possible origins, I'll create a question that requires analysis and integration of multiple concepts:\n\nQuestion: A linguist is researching the etymology of the English word \"smidgen\" and its possible connections to Irish and Scottish Gaelic.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the nuanced quantum behavior of nuclei in a diatomic molecule.\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation assumes that nuclear positions vary slowly compared to electron dynamics. However, as the question points out, nuclei are subject to quantum fluctuations. For a diatomic molecule, the nuclear coordinates are indeed delocalized in the angular dimension, which might seem to contradict the approximation.\n\nThe key insight comes from the top answer, which explains that for a system with zero angular momentum, the angular part of the wavefunction is constant after decoupling angular coordinates from internal ones.

Use both hands on the metal rod to bend it, the plastic valve that the rod connects to cannot take a lot of stress. That should stop the water flowing about 1\", maybe less, to the top of the overflow tube.\n\nIf the water level still rises up and over the overflow tube, try the bend one more time, setting the blue ball even lower. If it still runs on, then the filler needs replaced, it is not stopping the water as it should.\n\nLooking at the picture again, check to see if the blue ball is hitting the side of the tank, not allowing it to rise high enough to stop the waterflow.

In terms of, how does this reflect on my original data from the regression?\n\nI'm totally stumped, thanks guys\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Linear regression in fact models the conditional expected values of your outcome. That means: if you knew the true values of the regression parameters (say $\\\\beta\\_0$ and $\\\\beta\\_1$), given a value of your predictor X, filling that out in the equation\n$$\nE\\[Y\\|X] \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X\n$$\nwill have you calculate the expected value for $Y$ over all (possible) observations that have this given value for $X$.\n\nHowever: you don't really expect any single $Y$ value for that given $X$ value to be exactly equal to the (conditional) mean. Not because your model is wrong, but because there are some effects you have not accounted for (e.g. measuring error). So these $Y$ values for a given $X$ values will fluctuate around the mean value (i.e. geometrically: around the point of the regression line for that $X$).\n\nThe normality assumption, now, says that the difference between the $Y$s and their matching $E\\[Y\\|X]$ follows a normal distribution with mean zero. This means, if you have an $X$ value, then you can sample a $Y$ value by first calculating $\\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X$ (i.e. again $E\\[Y\\|X]$, the point on the regression line), next sampling $\\\\epsilon$ from that normal distribution and adding them:\n$$\nY'\\=E\\[Y\\|X] \\+ \\\\epsilon\n$$\n\nIn short: this normal distribution represents the variability in your outcome *on top of* the variability explained by the model.\n\nNote: in most datasets, you don't have multiple $Y$ values for any given $X$ (unless your predictor set is categorical), but this normality goes for the whole population, not just the observations in your dataset.\n\nNote: I've done the reasoning for linear regression with one predictor, but the same goes for more: just replace \"line\" with \"hyperplane\" in the above."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about linear regression and the normal distribution of residuals, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is analyzing the relationship between advertising spend (X) and sales (Y) using linear regression.

What is the most accurate interpretation of this observation in the context of the regression analysis?\n\nA) The normal distribution of residuals indicates that the model is perfectly predicting sales for all levels of advertising spend.\n\nB) The normal distribution suggests that unmeasured factors affecting sales are randomly distributed and consistent across different levels of advertising spend.\n\nC) The normal distribution of residuals implies that there is no need to consider non-linear relationships between advertising spend and sales.\n\nD) The normal distribution indicates that the relationship between advertising spend and sales is entirely random and not meaningful.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The normal distribution of residuals in a linear regression model has important implications for the analysis. It does not mean that the model is perfect (ruling out option A) or that the relationship is meaningless (ruling out option D).\n\nInstead, it suggests that the unexplained variability in the outcome (sales) follows a consistent pattern across different levels of the predictor (advertising spend). This aligns with the explanation in the documentation that \"this normal distribution represents the variability in your outcome on top of the variability explained by the model.\"\n\nThe normal distribution of residuals indicates that:\n1. The model's errors are symmetric around zero, meaning it's not systematically over- or under-predicting.\n2.

Read on...\n\nNote:\n-----\n\nAs my understanding of this problem has evolved, so has this question. As a result the question itself is similar but the code example and underlying details/reasoning in the following body of text have changed significantly since the question was first asked.\n\n### Context\n\nI have an incredibly basic application (code at the bottom) that draws a single elipses in the drawRect: method of a custom UIView. The application demonstrates the difference in performance when the size of the elipses being drawn remains the same but the size of the custom UIView gets larger:\n\n![Small UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeyrI.png)\n\n![Large UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RdFE.png)\n\nI ran the application on both an iPod 4th Gen running iOS 4\\.3\\.5 and an iPad 1st Gen running iOS 5\\.1\\.1 a series of times using custom UIViews of different sizes.  \n\nThe following table displays the results taken from the time profiler instrument:\n\n![Time profiler results](https://i.stack.imgur.com/53aLc.png)\n\nThe following instrument traces display the details of the two extremes for each device:\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9aUSA.png)\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HL6WF.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhWR0.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JweVL.png)\n\nAs you can (*hopefully*) see in 3 out of the 4 cases we get what we'd expect: the majority of time was spent performing the custom UIViews drawRect: method and each held 10fps.  \n\nBut the forth case shows a plumet in performance with the application struggling to hold 7fps while only drawing a single shape. The majority of time was spent copying memory during the UIView's CALayer's display method, specifically:\n\n\\[CALayer display] \\>  \n\n\\[CALayer \\_display] \\>  \n\nCABackingStoreUpdate \\>  \n\nCA::Render::ShmemBitmap::copy\\_pixels(CA::Render::ShmemBitmap const\\*, CGSRegionObject\\*) \\>  \n\nmemcpy$VARIANT$CortexA8\n\nNow it doesn't take a genius to see from the figures that something seriously wrong here. With a custom UIView of size 960 x 1380, iOS 4\\.3\\.5 spends over 4 times the amount of time copying memory around than it does drawing the entire view's contents.\n\n### Question\n\nNow, given the context, I ask my question again:\n\n**Why, on iOS 4\\.3\\.5, do 'large' (960 x 1380\\) custom UIView's perform CABackingStoreUpdate so inefficiently and how can I improve the performance of drawing operations?**\n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nI have also posted this question on the [Apple Developer forums](https://devforums.apple.com/message/791651#791651).\n\n### The Real Deal\n\nNow, obviously, I've reduced my real problem to the simplest reproducible case for the sake of this question. I'm actually attempting to animate a portion of a 960 x 1380 custom UIView that sits inside a UIScrollView.\n\nWhilst I appreciate the temptation to steer anyone towards OpenGL ES when they're not achieving the level of performance they want through Quartz 2D I ask that anyone that takes that route at least offer an explanation as to why Quartz 2D is struggling to perform even the most basic of drawing operations on iOS 4\\.3\\.5 where iOS 5\\.1\\.1 has no problem. As you can imagine I'm not thrilled about the idea of re\\-writing everything for this cornerstone case.\nThis also applies for people suggesting using Core Animation. Although I've used an elipses changing colour (a task perfectly suited for Core Animation) in the demo for the sake of simplicity, the drawing operations I'd actual like to perform are a large quantity of lines expanding over time, a drawing task Quartz 2D is ideal for (when it is performant!). Plus, again, this would require a re\\-write and doesn't help explain this odd performance problem.\n\n### Code\n\n> TViewController.m (Implementation of a standard view controller)\n\n```\n#import \"TViewController.h\"\n#import \"TCustomView.h\"\n\n// VERSION 1 features the custom UIView the same size as the screen.\n// VERSION 2 features the custom UIView nine times the size of the screen.\n#define VERSION 2\n\n@interface TViewController ()\n@property (strong, nonatomic) TCustomView *customView;\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSTimer *animationTimer;\n@end\n\n@implementation TViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    // Custom subview.\n    TCustomView *customView = [[TCustomView alloc] init];\n    customView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\n#if VERSION == 1\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 460.0f);\n#else\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 960.0f, 1380.0f);\n#endif\n\n    [self.view addSubview:customView];\n\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *singleTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];\n    [customView addGestureRecognizer:singleTap];\n\n    self.customView = customView;\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapGesture\n{\n    self.customView.value = 0.0f;\n\n    if (!self.animationTimer  || !self.animationTimer.isValid) {\n        self.animationTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.1 target:self selector:@selector(animationLoop) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];\n    }\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)animationLoop\n{\n    // Update model here.

Originally 1024x1024 was the maximum size a UIView could be, and whilst this restriction has since been lifted it is entirely likely that views larger than this only became efficient in iOS5 and later.\n\nI'd conjecture that the excess memory copying you are seeing in iOS4 is due to UIKit using a full size memory buffer for the large UIView, but then having to copy appropriate sized tiles of it before they can be composited; and that in iOS5 and later they've either removed any restriction on the size of the tiles that can be composited, or changed the way UIKit renders for such large UIViews.\n\nIn terms of working around this bottleneck on iOS4 you can try tiling the area you want to cover with smaller UIViews. If you structure it as:\n\n```\n\n  Parent View - contains drawing and event related code\n    Tile View 1 - contains drawRect\n    ...\n    Tile View n - contains drawRect\n\n```\n\nIn each tile view, you can ask the parent view to render its contents after adjusting the graphics context's transform appropriately. This means you don't have to change the drawing code, it will just be invoked multiple times (there is a small overhead for this, but remember each invocation will be drawing only a portion of the whole view).\n\nNote that its important that the parent view does not have a drawRect method \\- otherwise UIKit will think you want to draw into it directly and it will create a backing store thus putting you back in the same situation.\n\nThere is also CATiledLayer that you could look into \\- this does the tiling for you but asynchronously; meaning that your drawing code and such has to handle being executed from one or more background threads."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A developer is optimizing a custom UIView for an iOS application that needs to support both iOS 4.3.5 and iOS 5.1.1.

Which approach is most likely to improve performance across both iOS versions while minimizing code changes?\n\nA) Implement the drawing using OpenGL ES instead of Quartz 2D\nB) Split the large UIView into multiple smaller tiled UIViews, each handling a portion of the drawing\nC) Use Core Animation layers for all drawing operations instead of custom drawRect: methods\nD) Increase the animation frame rate to compensate for the performance loss on iOS 4.3.5\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation reveals a significant performance discrepancy between iOS 4.3.5 and iOS 5.1.1 when dealing with large custom UIViews (960x1380 pixels). On iOS 4.3.5, there's a substantial performance drop due to inefficient CABackingStoreUpdate operations, particularly in memory copying.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate solution because:\n\n1. It addresses the core issue of large view sizes causing performance problems on iOS 4.3.5 without requiring a complete rewrite of the drawing logic.\n2. By splitting the large view into smaller tiles, each under the problematic size threshold (likely 1024x1024), it avoids triggering the inefficient memory copying observed in iOS 4.3.5.\n3. This approach works for both iOS versions, maintaining performance on iOS 5.1.1 while significantly improving it on iOS 4.3.5.\n4. It allows for reuse of existing Quartz 2D drawing code, which is stated as preferable for the actual use case involving complex line drawings.\n\nOption A (OpenGL ES) is avoided as per the question's request, and would require a complete rewrite.

They report that when they use \"su root\" and then try to run the \"usermod\" command, they receive a \"command not found\" error. However, when they use \"su -\" to switch to the root user, the \"usermod\" command works as expected. What is the most likely explanation for this behavior, and what does it reveal about system security design?\n\nA) The \"su root\" command is deprecated and doesn't provide full root access, unlike \"su -\"\nB) The junior admin's default shell doesn't include /usr/sbin in its PATH, while root's login shell does\nC) The \"usermod\" command is aliased differently in interactive vs. non-interactive shell sessions\nD) The system has a corrupted root user profile that only loads correctly with the \"su -\" command\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of how \"su\" and \"su -\" differ in terms of environment variables, particularly PATH. The key lies in understanding that \"su root\" maintains the user's existing environment, including their PATH, which likely doesn't include /usr/sbin where administrative commands like \"usermod\" are typically located. In contrast, \"su -\" simulates a full login, loading the root user's environment, including a PATH that contains /usr/sbin.\n\nThis scenario reveals an important aspect of system security design: segregation of administrative commands. By placing these commands in directories not typically in a regular user's PATH, the system adds a layer of protection against accidental or unauthorized use of powerful system administration tools. This design choice reflects the principle of least privilege, ensuring that even if a user can switch to the root account, they still need to explicitly request the full root environment to access all administrative capabilities.\n\nThe distractors represent plausible misconceptions:\nA) Suggests a non-existent deprecation of a common command.\nB) Is the correct answer, explaining the PATH difference.\nC) Introduces a plausible but incorrect explanation involving shell behavior.\nD) Proposes a system-level issue that could cause similar symptoms but is much less likely.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (su behavior, environment variables, system security design) and applies them to a real-world troubleshooting scenario, targeting higher-level cognitive skills like analysis and evaluation."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/19", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/259049", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/107558/"], "docs_id": 259049, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to post\\-process GPS files via Differential processing (DGPS/DGNSS mode)\n\nusing rtklib (<http://www.rtklib.com/>).\n\nI have rover and base observations in .rinex format.\n\nI took FINAL satellite orbit solutions from NOAA\\-CDDIS archive (<https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/GNSS/orbit_products.html>) in the following format:\n\nWWWW/igsWWWWD.sp3\\.Z\n\nUsing the utility rtkpost from rtklib I get the error \"no nav data\".\n\nIs that a problem of the sp3 format?

This solution addresses several key aspects of the problem:\n\n1. Automation: The custom script can be integrated into the QGIS Processing Toolbox, allowing it to be easily applied to multiple raster layers or used in batch processing.\n\n2. Additional attributes: The script demonstrates how to calculate and include extra attributes such as minimum/maximum coordinates, centroid, area, perimeter, height, and width. This goes beyond the basic extent polygon.\n\n3. Flexibility: By creating a custom script, the analyst can modify the code to add or remove attributes as needed for their specific project requirements.\n\n4. Integration: The script can be saved in the QGIS processing scripts directory, making it readily available for future use and sharing with other team members.\n\n5.

Option D unnecessarily complicates the mission and doesn't address the fundamental physics behind the concern.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the student to apply the concept of inertial frames to a practical engineering scenario, rather than simply recalling the equation F = ma.

By Banach\\-Alaoglu, to show that the closed convex hull of $(y\\_n)$ is weakly compact it is sufficient to verify that $T$ is weak$^\\*$ to weak continuous. But that is the same as saying that $T^\\*$ maps $X^\\*$ into the predual $c\\_0$ of $\\\\ell\\_1$, which in turn is the same as saying that $(y\\_n)$ converges weakly to zero."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a Banach space X, a normalized sequence (x\u2096) converges weakly to 0.

This method, outlined in the top answer, provides a conceptual and direct proof using the properties of bounded linear operators and the relationship between weak and weak* topologies.\n\nThe key steps in this approach are:\n1. Define a bounded linear operator T:\u2113\u2081 \u2192 X that maps the nth unit vector in \u2113\u2081 to x\u2099.\n2. Use the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, which states that the closed unit ball in the dual of a normed space is weak* compact.\n3. Show that T is weak*-to-weak continuous, which is equivalent to showing that T* maps X* into c\u2080 (the predual of \u2113\u2081).\n4. This continuity is directly related to the weak convergence of (x\u2096) to zero.\n\nThis method is more efficient than the others because:\n- It avoids the need for manual checking of subfamilies (unlike option A).\n- It doesn't rely on norm-compactness, which is stronger and often harder to prove (unlike option B).\n- It doesn't require checking every weakly convergent sequence, which could be more time-consuming (unlike option D).\n\nThe approach leverages fundamental theorems in functional analysis and directly connects the weak convergence of (x\u2096) to the weak compactness of its closed convex hull, making it the most elegant and efficient solution to the problem."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/22", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/161168", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/33058/"], "docs_id": 161168, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: System cron starts Magento 2 cron every minute:\n\n```\n$ crontab -l\n*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/php /home/user/prj/mage2/bin/magento cron:run >> /home/user/prj/mage2/var/log/cron.log\n\n```\n\nI see new line `Ran jobs by schedule.` is added every minute into the log.\n\nThis is my settings for my task:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_Cron:etc/crontab.xsd\">\n    <group id=\"default\">\n        <job name=\"my_own\" instance=\"\\Vendor\\Module\\Cron\\Task\" method=\"execute\">\n            <schedule>...</schedule>\n        </job>\n    </group>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nThese settings run my job every 15 minutes in fact (my own message is added every 15 minutes into the log):\n\n```\n<schedule>* * * * *</schedule>\n<schedule>*/1 * * * *</schedule>\n\n```\n\nThis is my log:\n\n```\n...\nRan jobs by schedule.\nRan jobs by schedule.\nRan jobs by schedule.\nMy own job is started.\nRan jobs by schedule.\n...\n\n```\n\nThese are Magento 2 cron settings:\n[![Magento 2 Cron settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDo43.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDo43.png)\n\nHow can I set `<schedule>` to run my task every 1 minute?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are 2 groups in Magento 2 cron: `index` \\& `default`.

We can (and often do) change their definitions; for example, in Gaussian units, we set $1/4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon\\_0 \\\\to 1$. \n\n---\n\nAn edit to address the comment: light and gravitational waves travel at the \"speed of light\" because they obey the relativistic wave equation,\n$$\\\\partial^2 \\\\phi \\= (\\\\partial\\_t^2 \\- \\\\partial\\_x^2\\) \\\\phi \\= 0\\.$$\nYou can't write this second\\-order differential equation in terms of two first\\-order differential equations in a natural way; you have to make an arbitrary choice. For example, let's consider the simpler case of the harmonic oscillator, $\\\\partial\\_t^2 x \\= \\-\\\\omega^2 x$. We can rewrite this equation as\n$$y \\= \\\\alpha \\\\partial\\_t x, \\\\quad x \\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial\\_t y$$\nby introducing the intermediate quantity $y$. Then you could say $\\\\alpha$ is the \"resistance to motion\" while $\\\\omega^2/\\\\alpha$ is the \"restoring force\". But these quantities are totally meaningless because $\\\\alpha$ is arbitrary.

The key insight is that functions with domains that are proper classes cannot be formally represented as triples (X, Y, F), where X is the domain, Y is the codomain, and F is the function itself. This is because proper classes cannot be elements of sets, and the triple representation is itself a set.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while alternative notations might exist, the fundamental issue is not notation but the set-theoretical limitations of proper classes.\n\nOption B is correct.

Yes, but it might have been rare occurrences! never really the most probable outcome given the predictors in the model. You didn't give us a context, what your classes represent in the \"real world\". You have very unbalanced classes. That might be because some classes really are uncommon in your population, or it might be some problems with data collection. You didn't tell us.

Logistic regression gives you estimated probabilities for class membership, and instead of just looking at the maximum predicted probability, you could compare the predicted probabilities with the population proportions.

In Indian schools we are generally taught that present perfect means that action has **finished** in the past. We don't know the exact time when the action was finished. For instance,\n\n> *I have finished my work.*\n\n> *He has killed the mosquito.*\n\nSo it means action happened somewhere near in the past.

It acknowledges that present perfect can indeed represent ongoing states, contrary to the common misconception that it always indicates finished actions.\n2. It reflects the nuanced use of present perfect continuous, which often emphasizes duration or the temporary nature of an action.\n3. It indirectly addresses the confusion about verbs of state or sensation, which are often used in simple tenses but can appear in perfect or continuous forms with subtle differences in meaning.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the grammatical concepts, challenging the learner to think critically about the usage of these tenses beyond simple rules of finished vs. ongoing actions. The distractors represent common misconceptions, such as the overgeneralization that present perfect always indicates finished actions (option A) or that these tenses can be used interchangeably (option D)."}, "68": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/25", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/62566", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/25390/"], "docs_id": 62566, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am about to seal the gap between my tub and the wall tile with caulk (it was originally grout which cracked so I chiseled out what I could).

The expert states that \"That gap is too small,\" indicating that the current gap is suitable for grouting rather than caulking.\n\n2. They advise to \"Push *really* hard with the float to completely fill it with grout, giving it one more shot.\" This emphasizes the importance of proper application technique to ensure the grout fills the gap entirely.\n\n3.

A [previous question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252914/how-to-get-the-hot-questions-by-some-query) asks how to get information on this via the data explorer, and it seems this is not possible.\n\nSo, I have a feature request: **please make the Hot Network Questions list auditable from within the Stack Exchange Data Explorer**.\n\nWhat I have in mind is a new table which contains:\n\n* the question id\n* the date and time the question got on the list\n* the date and time the question got off the list\n* if feasible, the number of views driven to the question via the sidebar\n* if feasible, the per\\-site breakdown of those referrals\n\t+ if that's not feasible, maybe a breakdown per category as separated on [the main SE list](https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentanswered), or just\n\t+ a per\\-site breakdown only for sites within the same category as the hosting site\n\nA table like this would go a long way to help understand the effects of the sidebar. For example, it would enable queries to dig out\n\n* HNQs that were closed after their time on the spotlight, or\n* that were heavily downvoted, possibly\n* preferentially by users with 200\\+ rep on the host site.\n\nThese give a better idea of what sorts of questions cause tensions within the site, which can help suggest ways to minimize those tensions, as well as provide a more accurate picture of the extent to which it is a problem.\n\nA table like this would also provide of information on how the sidebar *can* help a site, including\n\n* users whose first answer is on a HNQ that go on to become established users, and the questions that capture them\n* good answers (as e.g. with a high score accumulated after the spotlight goes away) posted during the spotlight period, and the questions that sparked them.\n\nA lot of the good that the HNQ does to a site is much harder to measure (as it is mostly in the form of traffic, what it does after landing, and whether those users return later or not) but a simple table like this provides a fair amount of insight.\n\nI am aware that any addition to the SEDE needs to be thought about carefully, and there is always a development cost, but this one looks rather simple to me. It rides on logging that is (hopefully) already done, and which otherwise should pose a very small performance hit, and the rest of the processing can be done offline. The table itself should be pretty light (particularly if it only contains on and off dates), and it represents a small subset of questions to begin with.

In theory, one could extract it from the raw request logs but in practice that's a massive headache for more than a few days at a time. \n\nAnd we're already talking about quite a bit of data. Figure that the hot list is refreshed every 3 minutes, and contains 100 entries (neither of those are probably quite right, but close enough for a napkin estimate). That's 48 thousand rows every day, pretty close to the number of PostHistory entries created per day on Stack Overflow. \n\nOf course, that's across all sites. It wouldn't really make much sense to put these in an individual site's database, since you'd want the full list to interpret them. So we'd have to put it somewhere else. Internally, there's a Sites database that holds on to stuff that isn't attached to a specific site, but exposing that in SEDE would be a bit odd. In any case, you'd have to be doing cross\\-database joins to get any of the information you're after, unless we denormalized it (as we do internally for *generating* the hot list)... But of course, that would increase the size of the data being stored as well.\n\nFinally, some of what you're after cannot be exposed in public data *ever*: revealing the reputation of voters.\n\nIn any case, this is a lot less trivial than it sounds. And that's not even getting into the secondary issues of which \"hot\" posts are actually *displayed* \\- the sidebar lists pick a random sample, and *those are cached too*. And of course, this does nothing for questions that get heavily\\-shared on social media or end up in the newsletter or whatever. \n\nNot gonna say this can never happen.

Usually the symbols used are taken from the IPA, but they represent only the sounds and their distribution and pronunciation **in that language**.\n\nFor instance, [this is the American English phonemic system](http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/modestproposal.pdf), from [Kenyon and Knott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_and_Knott).\n\nEnglish dictionaries published in the United States normally don't use phonemic pronunciation, preferring the system invented by Noah Webster, based on spelling instead of phonetics. Webster was a spelling reformer, and believed that the traditional English spelling could be used to indicate phonetics. He was wrong, but that hasn't influenced American dictionaries.\n\nEnglish dictionaries published elsewhere, or bilingual dictionaries, or dictionaries intended for language learners, normally do use standard phonemic transcription. If you have a bilingual dictionary, look at the pronunciations in the English part; they will normally use either the system of Kenyon and Knott (American) or a system of [RP (UK)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_pronunciation), which has some differences from American.

It is a universal system designed to represent all human speech sounds, making it applicable across languages.\n2. The IPA contains symbols for all sounds that occur in any human language, providing the necessary flexibility for accurate transcription.\n3.

It avoids the limitations of language-specific systems like Noah Webster's spelling-based approach or Merriam-Webster's non-phonemic style, which are tailored to English and may not accurately represent sounds in other languages.\n5.

Then we get a conserved current\n$$J^{\\\\mu} \\= {\\\\partial {\\\\mathcal L} \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\phi\\_{,\\\\mu}} \\\\phi^{,\\\\nu} a\\_{\\\\nu} \\- {\\\\mathcal L} a^{\\\\mu} \\= \\\\left ({\\\\partial {\\\\mathcal L} \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\phi\\_{,\\\\mu}} \\\\phi^{,\\\\nu} \\- {\\\\mathcal L} g^{\\\\mu \\\\nu} \\\\right) a\\_{\\\\nu} .$$\nWe obtain a conserved charge from it by letting $Q \\\\equiv \\\\int J^0 {\\\\rm d}^3x$ since from $\\\\partial\\_{\\\\mu}J^{\\\\mu} \\=0$\nwe have that\n$$ {\\\\partial Q \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\= \\\\int {\\\\rm Div}{\\\\mathbf J}\\\\, {\\\\rm d}^3 x \\= 0$$ \nwhich holds any time the currents decay sufficiently quickly.\n\nIf the transformation is given by translation $m\\_{\\\\nu} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\delta x^{\\\\mu} \\= \\\\epsilon \\\\delta^{\\\\mu}\\_{\\\\nu}$ we get four conserved currents\n$$J^{\\\\mu \\\\nu} \\= {\\\\partial {\\\\mathcal L} \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\phi\\_{\\\\mu}} \\\\phi^{\\\\nu} \\- {\\\\mathcal L} g^{\\\\mu \\\\nu} .$$\n\nThis object is more commonly known as stress energy tensor $T^{\\\\mu \\\\nu}$ and the associated conserved currents are known as momenta $p^{\\\\nu}$.\nAlso, in general the conserved current is simply given by $J^{\\\\mu} \\= T^{\\\\mu \\\\nu} a\\_{\\\\nu}$.\n\nFor a Lorentz transformation we have\n$$m\\_{\\\\sigma \\\\tau} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\delta x^{\\\\mu} \\=\n\\\\epsilon \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} x^{\\\\tau} \\- g^{\\\\mu \\\\tau} x^{\\\\sigma} \\\\right)$$ (notice that this is antisymmetric and so there are just 6 independent parameters of the transformation) and so the conserved currents are the angular momentum currents\n$$M^{\\\\sigma \\\\tau \\\\mu} \\= x^{\\\\tau}T^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} \\- x^{\\\\sigma}T^{\\\\mu \\\\tau}.$$\nFinally, we obtain the conserved angular momentum as\n$$M^{\\\\sigma \\\\tau} \\= \\\\int \\\\left(x^{\\\\tau}T^{0 \\\\sigma} \\- x^{\\\\sigma}T^{0 \\\\tau} \\\\right) {\\\\rm d}^3 x . $$\n\nNote that for particles we can proceed a little further since their associated momenta and angular momenta are not given by an integral. Therefore we have simply that $p^{\\\\mu} \\= T^{\\\\mu 0}$ and $M^{\\\\mu \\\\nu} \\= x^{\\\\mu} p^{\\\\nu} \\- x^{\\\\nu} p^{\\\\mu}$. The rotation part of this (written in the form of the usual pseudovector) is\n$${\\\\mathbf L}\\_i \\= {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\epsilon\\_{ijk} M^{jk} \\= ({\\\\mathbf x} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf p})\\_i$$\nwhile for the boost part we get\n$$M^{0 i} \\= \\\\left(t {\\\\mathbf p} \\- {\\\\mathbf x} E \\\\right)^i $$\nwhich is nothing else than the center of mass at $t\\=0$ (we are free to choose $t$ since the quantity is conserved) multiplied by $\\\\gamma$ since we have the relations $E \\= \\\\gamma m$, ${\\\\mathbf p} \\= \\\\gamma m {\\\\mathbf v}$. Note the similarity to the ${\\\\mathbf E}$, $\\\\mathbf B$ decomposition of the electromagnetic field tensor $F^{\\\\mu \\\\nu}$."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Noether's Theorem and conserved currents, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is studying the implications of Lorentz boost invariance in a relativistic field theory. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the conserved quantity associated with this symmetry?\n\nA) The conservation of the center of mass position in the laboratory frame\nB) The conservation of the total angular momentum of the system\nC) The conservation of the relativistic center of energy at a fixed time\nD) The conservation of the total linear momentum of the system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and integration of multiple concepts from Noether's Theorem and special relativity. The correct answer is C: The conservation of the relativistic center of energy at a fixed time.\n\nThe documentation shows that for Lorentz boosts, the conserved current is given by the boost part of the angular momentum tensor: M^(0i) = (t**p** - **x**E)^i. This quantity is conserved and represents the center of energy (or center of mass-energy) of the system at a fixed time, typically chosen as t=0.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the center of mass position in the laboratory frame is not a conserved quantity in special relativity. It changes under Lorentz boosts.\n\nOption B is partially correct but too broad. While the total angular momentum (including both rotations and boosts) is conserved, the question specifically asks about the quantity associated with Lorentz boost invariance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the conservation of linear momentum is associated with translational invariance, not Lorentz boost invariance.\n\nThe correct answer, C, captures the essence of the conserved quantity: the relativistic center of energy. This is analogous to the center of mass in non-relativistic physics but incorporates the equivalence of mass and energy in special relativity. The conservation of this quantity ensures that the \"balance point\" of the system's energy distribution remains constant, even as observed from different inertial frames related by Lorentz boosts.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to connect the mathematical formalism (M^(0i) = (t**p** - **x**E)^i) with its physical interpretation, requiring a deep understanding of both Noether's Theorem and special relativity."}, "75": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/27", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/9821", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/2036/"], "docs_id": 9821, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\n\\documentclass[fleqn,12pt,a4paper]{article}\n\\usepackage{chemarrow}\n\\newcommand\\Ra{$\\autorightarrow{\\scriptsize{Text over arrow}}{} $}\n\\begin{document}\n\\Ra \n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nAs shown in the image, is it possible to change the gap between the arrow and the text over the arrow.

The \\vbox allows for vertical stacking of elements, while the \\hbox ensures proper horizontal alignment of the text. The \\vskip-5pt command provides a negative vertical skip, effectively moving the text closer to the arrow.

The correct answer, C (Janna), is the most effective counter-strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. Mobility: Janna's high mobility helps avoid Zyra's skillshots and plant attacks.\n2. Ranged capability: Janna can poke and harass from a safe distance, matching Zyra's range advantage.\n3.

It shows that the term has been in use since at least the early 1960s, with examples dating back to 1962. The term evolved from earlier uses in electronics and engineering, where it referred to defects or flaws in circuits and machines. \n\nThe widespread use of \"bugged\" to describe software issues is not a recent phenomenon or limited to a specific region or cultural group. Instead, it represents a long-standing tradition in software development terminology. The documentation provides numerous examples across decades and various technical publications, demonstrating its pervasive use in the field.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it refers to an older, unrelated usage of \"bugged\" in surveillance contexts.

Which of the following LaTeX code snippets would best achieve this goal while maintaining readability and following conventional notation practices?\n\nA) \\newcommand{\\elementwise}[1]{\\overset{\\circ}{#1}}\n   $A \\elementwise{\\cdot} B$, $A \\elementwise{\\div} B$, $A \\elementwise{\\exp} B$\n\nB) \\newcommand{\\Pexp}{\\mathbin{\\text{$\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\textcircled{$e$}}}$}}}\n   $A \\odot B$, $A \\oslash B$, $A \\Pexp B$\n\nC) \\usepackage{amssymb}\n   $A \\otimes B$, $A \\oslash B$, $A^{\\circ B}$\n\nD) \\newcommand{\\elop}[1]{\\mathbin{\\text{$\\bigcirc$}}_{#1}}\n   $A \\elop{\\times} B$, $A \\elop{/} B$, $A \\elop{\\exp} B$\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of LaTeX notation principles for mathematical operations. Option B is the best choice because:\n\n1. It uses $\\odot$ for element-wise multiplication and $\\oslash$ for element-wise division, which are consistent with the conventions mentioned in the documentation.\n\n2. It introduces a new command \\Pexp for element-wise exponentiation, which visually aligns with the other operations while being distinct.\n\n3. The \\Pexp command creates a circled 'e' symbol, which intuitively represents exponentiation and is visually consistent with the other element-wise operations.\n\n4. This notation maintains readability and clarity, especially in complex expressions.\n\nOption A is less ideal because it overloads the \\circ notation, which could be confused with function composition. Option C misuses \\otimes (typically used for tensor products) and introduces an unconventional notation for exponentiation. Option D, while creative, introduces unnecessary complexity and deviates from standard notation practices.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (LaTeX commands, mathematical notation, and typesetting conventions) and apply them to a real-world scenario of academic writing in mathematics or science."}, "81": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/13", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/351087", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/220587/"], "docs_id": 351087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a file and its content looks like:\n\n```\nabc=123|qwer=432|reiw=2344|xyz=123 445|tyu=23 rows\n\n```\n\nI have tried using `tr` and `sed` but I will need to use `awk`\n\nThe desired output should look like:\n\n```\nfile2:\n123|432|2344|123 445|23 rows\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\nperl -F'=|\\|' -pe '$_ = join \"|\", grep { $k++ % 2 } @F'\n\nsed -e 's/[^=|]*=//g'\n\n```"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A DevOps engineer is tasked with processing a large number of configuration files that follow the format shown in the documentation.

The correct answer, D, is the most efficient and robust solution for several reasons:\n\n1. It handles both '=' and '|' as field separators, making it more flexible for potential variations in the input format.\n2. It processes the input in a single pass, which is more efficient than multi-step approaches.\n3. The perl command uses the -F flag to specify multiple field separators, allowing for precise splitting of the input.\n4. The grep function with the modulo operator ($k++ % 2) elegantly selects every other field, which corresponds to the values we want to extract.\n5.

The correct answer is D, based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The Scavenger Trinket's passive effect is unique in that it applies to both players in co-op, but only one trinket is needed for this effect. As stated, \"So long as one of your traps added a combo point scavenger applies its passive effect even if the killing blow was dealt by your co-op partner.\"\n\n2. However, the general rule for trinket passives is that they \"apply to the owning player only,\" with Scavenger being the exception for its coin drop effect.\n\n3. Trinket active effects, on the other hand, \"apply to both players.\"\n\nTherefore, Bob equipping a second Scavenger Trinket won't increase the passive coin drop chance (ruling out options A and C), but it will allow him to use the trinket's active ability, which would benefit both players.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the passive effect doesn't stack, there is still a benefit to Bob equipping the trinket for its active ability.\n\nThis question tests the player's ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a specific scenario, and think critically about optimizing game strategy rather than simply recalling facts."}, "83": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/06/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/365064", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/200898/"], "docs_id": 365064, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: After upvoting or downvoting on any post, question or answer, I can't change it.

Given this information and the crack's location near what might be a chimney breast edge or removed wall, what is the most likely underlying cause of this issue that a general builder should investigate first?\n\nA) Water damage from a leaking roof\nB) Inadequate thickness of the plaster skim coat\nC) Structural movement of a supporting joist\nD) Improper installation of the plasterboard screws\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely underlying cause that requires immediate investigation is the structural movement of a supporting joist. This conclusion is based on several key observations from the documentation:\n\n1. The crack runs along the length of the ceiling and has broken not only along the join but also at the scrim (drywall tape) edges. This pattern suggests movement in the underlying structure rather than a surface-level issue.\n\n2. The visible nail that has pulled back under the surface indicates tension in the joint, which is more consistent with structural movement than with installation errors or water damage.\n\n3. The location near a chimney breast edge or possibly removed wall is significant, as these areas are often subject to structural changes or stress.\n\n4. Water damage is less likely because the documentation notes that scrim joints usually survive mild water damage without cracking, and there's no mention of discoloration.\n\n5. While the thin plaster skim and visible nail might suggest poor installation, these alone don't explain the extent and nature of the cracking.\n\n6. Improper screw installation is less likely to cause this type of widespread, tension-induced cracking.\n\nThe general builder should prioritize investigating the joist movement, as this represents a potentially serious structural issue that could worsen over time and may indicate problems with the building's overall integrity.

A resistor of 4 ohms (3\\.9 is the closest standard value) would limit the supply to its maximum rated current, but would also reduce the operating voltage of the LEDs to around 6 volts, which would no doubt result in unacceptable dimming and wasted power (about 10 watts).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The problem stems from an inrush current at startup, likely due to capacitors in the LED bulbs charging rapidly. This momentary surge trips the power supply's over-current protection.\n\n2. A 1-1.5 ohm resistor would limit the initial current surge to about 8-12A, which is high but brief. This may be enough to prevent the power supply from tripping while not significantly impacting LED performance during normal operation.\n\n3.

Assume ZFC \\+ $\\\\kappa$ is measurable. Let $G$ be Prikry generic at $\\\\kappa$. So $\\\\kappa$ has cofinality $\\\\omega$ in $V\\[G]$. Claim: In $V\\[G]$, $V\\_\\\\kappa$ models $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$. In fact, if $f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\kappa$ is cofinal and $f$ is definable over $V\\_{\\\\kappa\\+1}^{V\\[G]}$ from parameters in $V\\_\\\\kappa$, then $f\\\\in V$, so $f$ is bounded.

So if those models are indeed consistent through ZFC \\+ superstrongs, then one would need more than ZFC \\+ \\`\\`There is a superstrong extender'' to prove there is a non\\-inaccessible $\\\\alpha$ with $V\\_\\\\alpha$ modelling $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$.\n\n(The paper \"The definability of the extender sequence $\\\\mathbb{E}$ from $\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\upharpoonright\\\\aleph\\_1$ in $L\\[\\\\mathbb{E}]$\" contains enough to generalize the argument of Kennedy, Magidor, V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen for $L$.

Suppose first that $0^\\\\\\#$ does not exist. Note first that since $V\\_\\\\lambda$ models ZFC, $\\\\lambda$ is a (singular) strong limit cardinal. By Jensen's covering lemma, $\\\\lambda$ is singular in $L$. Let $B$ be the constructibly least singularization. Then $B$ can be defined over $V\\_{\\\\lambda\\+1}$ (without parameters), which contradicts $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$.\n\nThe argument for an inner model $M$ with a measurable is likewise, but using the Dodd\\-Jensen core model: We also have the appropriate version of covering for that core model $K\\=K^{\\\\mathrm{DJ}}$, and $K\\|(\\\\lambda^\\+)^K$ can also be defined in the codes over $V\\_{\\\\lambda\\+1}$, and hence the least singularization of $\\\\lambda$ in the $K$\\-order is definable.\n\nSo Edits 1 and 3 together give that ZFC \\+ \"There is a singular $\\\\lambda$ such that $V\\_\\\\lambda\\\\models\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$\" is equiconsistent with ZFC \\+ \"There is a measurable cardinal\"."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is studying the asymptotic behavior of a shifted sum involving the Euler totient function.

In the original smooth sum, \u03c6(n)/n is multiplicative, which allows for standard analytic techniques to derive asymptotics with a secondary main term. However, the shifted sum involves the product [\u03c6(n)/n * \u03c6(n+1)/(n+1)], which is clearly not multiplicative.\n\nThis loss of multiplicativity is significant because:\n\n1. Many standard techniques in analytic number theory rely on the multiplicative properties of arithmetic functions.\n2. The multiplicative nature of \u03c6(n)/n allows for the use of Euler products and related methods in the original analysis.\n3. Without multiplicativity, it becomes much more challenging to separate and analyze the contributions of different prime factors to the sum.\n\nWhile options A and C present plausible difficulties (oscillatory behavior in the secondary term and the influence of the weight function), these are secondary concerns compared to the fundamental change in the function's structure. Option D is incorrect because the logarithmic term is likely to remain relevant, possibly in a modified form.\n\nThe loss of multiplicativity requires a different analytical approach, potentially involving more complex techniques from analytic number theory or even the development of new methods to handle this specific type of shifted sum.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the measurability and measure of this set?\n\nA) The set A is not measurable because it has no interior points.\nB) The set A is measurable with a positive measure equal to its length of 2.\nC) The set A is measurable with measure zero, despite having uncountably many points.\nD) The set A is measurable, but its measure cannot be determined without additional information about the measure on R^2.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from measure theory. The set A is indeed measurable, and its measure is zero, which might seem counterintuitive given that it contains uncountably many points.\n\nTo understand why:\n\n1. We can prove that the outer measure \u03bc*(A) = 0:\n   - For any \u03b5 > 0, we can cover A with a rectangle [-\u03b5/2, \u03b5/2] \u00d7 [-1, 1].\n   - The area of this rectangle is \u03b5 \u00b7 2 = 2\u03b5.\n   - As \u03b5 \u2192 0, the outer measure of A must approach 0.\n\n2. We know that for any set, \u03bc*(A) \u2265 \u03bc*(A). Since \u03bc*(A) = 0, we must also have \u03bc*(A) = 0.\n\n3. By definition, A is measurable if \u03bc*(A) = \u03bc*(A). Here, both equal 0, so A is measurable.\n\n4. The measure of A is therefore 0, despite containing uncountably many points.\n\nThis counterintuitive result challenges the common misconception that uncountable sets must have positive measure (option B) or that sets with no interior cannot be measurable (option A). It also demonstrates that measurability doesn't depend on the cardinality of the set.\n\nOption D is incorrect because we can determine the measure without additional information about R^2, using only the properties of outer and inner measures as defined.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of measure theory concepts, the relationship between outer and inner measures, and the counterintuitive nature of measure zero sets in higher dimensions."}, "95": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/13", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/9618", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/2967/"], "docs_id": 9618, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to call ZoomToLayer from my custom code (shown below).\n\n```c#\nESRI.ArcGIS.esriSystem.UID pUID = new ESRI.ArcGIS.esriSystem.UID();\nICommandItem CmdItem;\n\n//pUID.Value = \"{18DF94D9-0F8A-11D2-94B1-080009EEBECB}\";\npUID.Value = \"esriArcMapUI.LayerContextMenuItems\";\npUID.SubType = 7;\n\nCmdItem = IApplication.Document.CommandBars.Find(pUID, true, false);\n\nCmdItem.Execute();\n\n```\n\nUpon investigation I found that CommandItem.Action is throwing COMException: \n\n'CmdItem.Action' threw an exception of type 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException \\- This method cannot be called on built in commands.\n\nI am trying to use it as a command and not tool...hence I cannot understand the exception.\n\nAny ideas why it's happening?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You also need to set the [IMxDocument.ContextItem](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/index.html#/IMxDocument_Interface/000v0000010w000000/) to the layer that you want to zoom to.

The recipe form is accepting nested attributes for the tags. The behavior I want is for duplicated tags to not be entered into the tags table, but just a new link pointing to the already existing tag be created. So if I have a tag with name \"Healthy\" and enter a new recipe and add the tag \"Healthy\" to it I don't want duplicate \"Healthy\" tags in the tag table. All that's needed is a new entry in the link table linking the new recipe to the old tag.\n\nWhat's the 'rails' approach to doing this. Right now I'm trying to hack it by passing the recipe\\_id in a hidden input field into the :reject\\_if lambda and save a new link there.

They've set up the models as described, but are struggling with preventing duplicate tags. Which approach would be the most Rails-idiomatic way to solve this problem while maintaining data integrity and adhering to the DRY principle?\n\nA) Implement a custom validator in the Tag model to check for existing tags before creation\nB) Use a before_save callback in the Recipe model to find or create tags\nC) Override the tags_attributes= method in the Recipe model to handle tag creation/linking\nD) Modify the Link model to automatically create tags if they don't exist on association\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most Rails-idiomatic approach to solve this problem is to override the tags_attributes= method in the Recipe model. This solution adheres to the principle of encapsulation and leverages Rails' built-in nested attributes functionality.\n\nBy overriding tags_attributes=, we can intercept the nested attributes before they're processed by accepts_nested_attributes_for. This allows us to implement custom logic to find existing tags or create new ones as needed, while still maintaining the simplicity of nested attribute forms.\n\nHere's how it might be implemented:\n\n```ruby\nclass Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base\n  # ... other code ...\n\n  def tags_attributes=(tag_attributes)\n    tag_attributes.each do |attributes|\n      if attributes[:id].blank?\n        tag = Tag.find_or_create_by(name: attributes[:name])\n        self.tags << tag unless self.tags.include?(tag)\n      else\n        tag = Tag.find(attributes[:id])\n        tag.update(attributes)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis approach solves several problems:\n1. It prevents duplicate tags by using find_or_create_by.\n2. It works for both new and existing recipes.\n3. It maintains the association between recipes and tags correctly.\n4. It allows for updating existing tags if needed.\n\nOption A is less ideal because it would require additional logic in the Tag model and might not handle the association correctly.\nOption B could work but is generally considered less idiomatic than overriding the attributes method.\nOption D violates the principle of separation of concerns by putting too much logic in the Link model.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of Rails conventions, nested attributes, and model relationships, while also requiring them to consider real-world application design principles."}, "97": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/30", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/148446", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/28182/"], "docs_id": 148446, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to pass on the move [Wish](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wish_(move)) to a line of Eevees, as well as get the right nature and IVs.

The moves will be learnt by deleting ones from the top and adding a move to the bottom of the move list.
