This configuration in sshd_config allows the SSH server to accept environment variables related to language and locale settings from the client. In this case, it's causing the LC_CTYPE variable to be passed from the local machine to the remote server, potentially leading to compatibility issues if the remote system doesn't support the specified locale. \n\nOption A is incorrect because PermitUserEnvironment allows users to load environment variables from a file, which is not the described issue.\n\nOption C is incorrect because UseLogin is related to using the system's login program instead of SSH's built-in one, which is not relevant to the environment variable problem.\n\nOption D is incorrect because AllowAgentForwarding is related to SSH agent forwarding and doesn't affect environment variables in this context."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/31", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/410866", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/259571/"], "docs_id": 410866, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I joined a company and the project I'm working on have an event handler that extends the FirstChanceException functionality to log the exceptions. The logs are stored in a file and not registered to the console.\nAll the controllers actions have try catch blocks and they ignore the exception in the catch (because it's being logged in the FirstChanceException event handler) and return a value so the user doesn't get any errors.\n\nI have a strong feeling that this is an antipattern or a bad practice but I don't have any good arguments.\n\nDo you find this a bad practice and why, what are the downsides of this approach?\n\nTo add a bit more context, I found annoying that they don't show logs in the console (I can't debug an app without logs on the console) so I configured it to show them in my dev environment. Latter on, I started to find random exceptions like sockets closing and ES operations failing. These exceptions don't show up if you remove the FirstChanceException event handler because they are being catch and handled by .Net code itself. So that's a downside but the don't even used logs in the console in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a bad practice for two major reasons:\n\n1. Extra code has been written \\- and has to continue to be written \\- for what the framework already does quite well. Register a logging exception handler within the pipeline framework being used itself and remove the `try`..`catch` (empty) paradigm from the controller actions. The actions should look pretty slim \\- validate incoming parameters, hand them off to a service layer, and then hand a successful result back. Let unhandlable errors be logged by the pipeline.\n2. Actions in controllers are expected by and large to adhere to the REST standard. And that standard allows for error codes to be returned to the client. Analyzing an HTTP status is quick and easy and client frameworks can perform all sorts of useful boilerplate logic (such as retries, etc.) based on that.\n\nAlso, (opinion\\-based) I feel that hiding errors from consumers is akin to \"security by obscurity\" \\- maybe they don't see what's happening, but errors ARE preventing the actions from succeeding. The hunt has to begin in the file logs for what happened when \\- and first chance exceptions occur all the time in the framework itself \\- you're going to have a lot of noise to (hopefully) very little signal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company's project uses FirstChanceException to log all exceptions to a file, with try-catch blocks in all controller actions that ignore exceptions.

This approach prevents proper client-side error handling because it doesn't return appropriate HTTP status codes, which are essential for RESTful APIs. Instead, it always returns a success response even when errors occur. This practice also creates unnecessary code duplication by implementing try-catch blocks in every controller action, rather than utilizing the framework's built-in error handling capabilities.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D touch on some valid points, they don't capture the main problems as effectively:\n\nA) Although this approach might violate some design principles, that wasn't the primary concern raised in the discussion.\nC) This is partially true and a valid concern, but it doesn't address the REST API issues or code duplication.\nD) While this approach might have some performance impact, it wasn't mentioned as a primary concern in the original post."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/21", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1462274", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/1065393/"], "docs_id": 1462274, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to generate ssh\\-keygen via cygwin and there is a problem when I entering path (it doesn't do anything).\n\nHere I just press enter and nothing was done:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5ymq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5ymq.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're probably not running the Cygwin `ssh-keygen` \\- what does `which ssh-keygen` show?

Create it manually before running ssh-keygen.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The issue described is likely caused by using a non-Cygwin version of ssh-keygen, possibly one installed by PuTTY or WinSCP. The solution is to use a specific command format that works with this version, specifying the key type, file path, and passphrase directly in the command. This approach bypasses the interactive prompts that are not functioning correctly. The correct file path format (/cygwin64/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa) is crucial, as it represents the Cygwin home directory structure.

Explanation with diagrams clarifying the practical and conceptual differences would be very much appreciated. How does the variable being stochastic make any difference? Why can't we use regular Machine Learning techniques for time series?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Auto\\-regressive models (ARIMA) use previous values as predictors depending upon the form of the model and forecasts are adaptive in form generally responding to previous values. Models using time as a predictor can be understood as using previous values to estimate the model parameters (thus previous values do come into play ) but they are otherwise not part of the forecast equation thus being generally non\\-adaptive or fixed until re\\-estimation occurs. Models using time or time\\-squared or time\\-cubed etc. are anachronistic and generally not used/preferred except in very simple textbooks and in very simple classroom exercises. Models using time variables will generally exhibit auto\\-correlated residuals thus should be studiously avoided as the presumed model. However my work usually includes/investigates both procedures as tentative/possible approaches since only the data knows which approach is better or which approach delivers a more efficient model. \n\nResponse to comment @Veneeth :\n\nI didn't say less accurate I wrote (implied) different. A time based model predicts based upon the input variable/series 1,2,3,3,...t which means that the prediction for t\\+2 ,t\\+ 3 , t\\+ 4 is fixed or deterministic or unchanged because when you observe y(t\\+1\\) as it was before you observed y(t\\+1\\). The new value has no effect on the prediction if you don't re\\-estimate parameters while a model that uses the value of y(t\\+1\\) et. al. and is ARIMA based will provide different forecasts. If you use the time predictor approach and re\\-estimate with y(t\\+1\\) in addition to all the previous y's the impact of the new observation will be normally minimal on the model coefficients unless the sample size is very small or the new observation is an anomaly which should be identified and neutralized.\n\nSince @Veneeth asked for a quantitative example , I attempt here to answer that.\nWith apologies to Charles Dickens one could entitle this as \" A tale of three approaches\" I selected a real world example not a trivial textbook example which emphasizes the impact of presumption when it comes to model identification .

It isn't quick and it takes a decent chunk of HDD space if you process a lot of files. As a note, the data I work with has fewer \"features\", more \"users\", and I use perl to process it.\n\nFirst off, I would not recommend storing the data together as a single matrix, since most programs (certainly R) will not be able to handle it. If you store each user as a separate file (.txt or whatever other format works better for you), you can then access them individually, even with R. \n\nThen, as a new document comes in, you will have to do 100,000 comparisons each between two vectors of length 10 million.\n\nHere's an example in R with two random binary vectors of length 10,000,000\\. \n\n```\nx=as.numeric(rnorm(10000000)<0)\n\ny=as.numeric(rnorm(10000000)<0)\n\nsim = crossprod(x,y)/sqrt(crossprod(x)*crossprod(y))  \n\n         [,1]\n[1,] 0.4999211\n\n```\n\nSince the two vectors in this example are random 0,1 vectors, they have a cosine similarity of 0\\.5\\. This one similarity (cosine sim) calculation took less than a second without me trying to optimize it. \n\nTo see how long your process would take, you could loop this code over 100,000 iterations and store each similarity result to a results vector that contains all its matches. I tried the above code with 1000 iterations and it took about 70 seconds.\n\nYou can also insert whatever similarity measure you desire. It is certainly doable in terms of computation time, but you may want to optimize this if you need it done faster.

You employ a strategy of asking indirect questions over time, hoping to piece together the information gradually. Which term best describes this approach?\n\nA) Coercing\nB) Finagling\nC) Bargaining\nD) Interrogating\n\nCorrect Answer: B) Finagling\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B) Finagling. This term accurately captures the essence of obtaining information through indirect, cunning, or persistent means, without resorting to threats or violence.\n\nA) Coercing is incorrect because it implies the use of force or threats, which is not part of the described strategy.\n\nB) Finagling is the best fit. It means to obtain something by indirect or involved means, often through trickery or manipulation, which aligns with the described approach of asking secondary questions and persisting until the information is revealed.\n\nC) Bargaining is not appropriate here, as it suggests a mutual exchange or negotiation, which is not the case in the given scenario.\n\nD) Interrogating is too direct and formal for the described situation. It implies a more confrontational and official questioning process, which doesn't match the indirect approach described.\n\nThe word \"finagle\" encompasses the idea of using clever, indirect methods to obtain information or achieve a goal, which is precisely what the question describes."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/08/03", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/389419", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/269936/"], "docs_id": 389419, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My previous gamertag was \"PlanetOrtalon86\" and I changed it to \"PlanetO86\".

Many older games allowed 16 characters for displaying gamertags. We reserve three of those characters for the suffix and one for the \\# symbol, leaving 12 characters for gamertags.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no way to get your old gamertag back if it doesn't meet the current requirements."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A player wants to change their Xbox gamertag back to their previous one, \"PlanetOrtalon86\". However, they encounter an error message about maximum length.

The gamertag \"PlanetOrtalon86\" is 15 characters long, which exceeds the current maximum length of 12 characters for Xbox gamertags. This limit was implemented to support the new suffix system, where Xbox reserves 4 characters (3 for the suffix and 1 for the # symbol) out of the previous 16-character limit. As a result, gamertags are now restricted to 12 characters. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the gamertag is too long, not too short. \nOption B is incorrect because while gamertags can't start with a number, this particular gamertag starts with a letter. \nOption D is incorrect because there are no special characters in the gamertag that would be disallowed."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/22", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/599913", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/254246/"], "docs_id": 599913, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm getting the following error on running `sudo apt-get update` :\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update                                                                \nGet:1 http://dl.google.com stable InRelease\n100% [1 InRelease gpgv 3,435 B] [Connecting to in.archive.ubuntu.com] [ConnectiSplitting up /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/dl.google.com_linux_talkplugin_deb_dists_stable_InReleaseIgn http://dl.google.com stable InRelease                                      \nE: GPG error: http://dl.google.com stable InRelease: Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)\n\n```\n\nI tried:\n\n```\n$ cd /var/lib/apt\n$ sudo mv lists lists.old\n$ sudo mkdir -p lists/partial\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\n```\n\nBut still getting the same error.

The error message indicates a GPG error with the Google repository, stating \"Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA'\". What is the most likely cause of this issue and its solution?\n\nA) The system's GPG keys are outdated and need to be renewed.\nB) The Google repository has been compromised and should be removed from the sources list.\nC) The apt package manager is corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.\nD) Google has discontinued HTTP support for its repository, requiring a switch to HTTPS.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The error message suggests that the system is unable to properly access the Google repository using HTTP. As mentioned in the documentation, Google has likely shut down their standard HTTP ports and now only supports HTTPS connections. The apt and dpkg tools don't automatically follow redirects from HTTP to HTTPS, resulting in the 'NODATA' error. The solution is to modify the repository URLs in the system's sources list, changing \"http://dl.google.com\" to \"https://dl.google.com\". This allows the system to properly connect to Google's repository and resolve the update issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while GPG key issues can cause problems, the specific error message doesn't indicate a key problem. Option B is incorrect as the repository isn't compromised; it's just using a different protocol. Option C is not correct because the issue is with the repository URL, not the apt package manager itself."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/01/21", "source":

Initial placeholder for the region field.\n4. AJAX script attached to the country field using setAfterElementHtml().\n5. The AJAX script correctly handles the change event on the country select.\n6. It makes an AJAX call to the regionlist controller action to fetch region data.\n7.

When the points are converted from Zone 8N to Zone 10N, they maintain their true location on Earth, but their position relative to the central meridian changes. In Zone 10N, the points are much farther from the central meridian than they were in Zone 8N, resulting in greater distortion and thus a larger calculated distance between them.

These pressure differences are formed by variations in temperature and weather, and the gradient between them helps to determine the strength of the wind felt. \n\nThis may be a simple view where there is just one area of high pressure and one of low pressure. If I read the second part correctly that is to do with the increased complexity of the atmosphere and pressure systems where you experience a less obvious wind direction. It's possible for the wind to move in all directions including downwards based on where the air is being pulled towards. It may be to do with interference as well such as the wind hitting buildings or other objects that will cause changes in the air patterns around them, there may also be more local heating effects that cause pressure variations leading to more complex air flows. In a large, open, area the wind will be more\\-or\\-less in one direction. An example would be on a ship at sea where from personal experience the wind comes from a specific direction. Compare that to a city where the wind deflecting off buildings will cause all sorts of local 'winds', though the overall propagation would be towards the global low perssure. \n\nOn a larger scale the rotation of the earth and heating by the sun is what drives the most high\\-level air currents. There is a pattern of these currents that is fairly well established from when ships used the wind for power. The effect of the earth on the wind is observed as the windspeeds are far higher in the upper atmosphere with thinner air and less interference from the ground (when very close)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the complex nature of wind patterns and their variability in different environments?\n\nA) Wind is solely caused by the Earth's rotation and has a constant direction globally.\n\nB) Wind patterns are primarily influenced by the sun's heat and are uniform across all terrains.\n\nC) Wind direction and strength are determined by pressure gradients, local topography, and atmospheric conditions, resulting in complex and variable air flows.\n\nD) Wind is always predictable and flows in a single direction from high pressure to low pressure areas without any external influences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the complexity of wind patterns as described in the documentation. Wind is indeed influenced by pressure gradients caused by temperature variations and weather systems. Local topography, such as buildings in cities, can alter wind patterns and create more complex air flows. The document also mentions that while there's an overall wind direction towards low pressure areas, local effects can cause wind to move in various directions, including downwards. This answer acknowledges both the large-scale factors (pressure systems) and small-scale influences (local terrain) that contribute to the variability of wind patterns we experience."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/07/07", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/318476", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/67761/"], "docs_id": 318476, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On the StackExchange\\-chat, I received quickly\\-made MWE's which answered parts of my question; yet remarkably show the experience and knowledge of the person who fabricated them.\n\nFor example, when I asked how to create a code which would automatically right\\-align a vertically stacked series of numbers (from 2 to 50\\), I got the following answers, which worked perfectly:\n\n[Answer 1](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/30878173#30878173):\n===============================================================================\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newcounter{loopcounter}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\setcounter{loopcounter}{50}\n\\loop\\unless\\ifnum\\value{loopcounter}=1\n\\llap{\\theloopcounter}\n\\addtocounter{loopcounter}{-1}\n\\repeat\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[Answer 2](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/30878258#30878258):\n===============================================================================\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newcounter{loopcounter}\n\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand{\\loopdown}[2]{%\n\\c@loopcounter=#1%\n\\loop\\unless\\ifnum\\value{loopcounter}=#2\n\\llap{\\theloopcounter}%\n\\advance \\c@loopcounter by -1\n\\repeat\n}\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\loopdown{50}{1}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nWhat I am wondering about, is how to regulate the vertical spacing between the different lines of numbers?

The fact that the image can be dynamically resized is one of the main benefits for using `UnifiedNativeAds` instead of predefined ads such as banners. \n\nThis is how I need to be displaying the `MediaView`, using `match_parent` for width and `wrap_content` for height. \n\n```\n<com.google.android.gms.ads.formats.MediaView\n            android:id=\"@+id/ad_media\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n            android:adjustViewBounds=\"true\"\n            android:scaleType=\"fitXY\"/>\n\n```\n\n[This is what I am currently getting from the above code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/prQnd.png)\n\n[This is what I need and expect it to look like from using `wrap_content`](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LTXmV.png)\n\nIn the previous case where we were able to render the images separately using ImageView, the `wrap_content` value correctly sized the image.\n\nDoes anyone have a workaround for this?

However this causes problems with understanding the setup for users, who are used to work with solutions, that handle SNAT in one single step.\n\nThe first step are SNAT actions. They ONLY define different possible combinations of external\\-2\\-internal IP address translation and the internal port you would want to translate to. This is just a list of possibilities you set up like Aliases. None of them is active, until you use it in a firewall rule.\n\nFor RDP connections, you would set up a SNAT actions like these:\n\n```\nName: Ext_123-RDP_101\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.101:3389 \n\nName: Ext_123-RDP_102\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.102:3389 \n\nName: Ext_123-RDP_103\nSNAT Members: 123.123.123.123 -> 10.10.10.103:3389 \n\n```\n\nSo that is the translation part.\nNext you need to set up firewall rules. Since it is never smart to leave open RDP ports, I would use authenticated users (authenticating them over <https://firewall_IP:4100>) that belong to a group 'Allow\\-RDP'.\n\nYou will need 3 rules, that will use the SNAT actions you have have already defined. Since there is no standard service for ports 3111\\-311x, you will create a custom template called SNAT\\-RDP and add a TCP port range 3111\\-3113 and than create the 3 new firewall rules based on this template.\n\n```\nName the new rules something like 'RDP-IN-101', 'RDP-IN-102' and 'RDP-IN-103'\n\n'RDP-IN-101':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_101 SNAT Action\n\n'RDP-IN-102':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_102 SNAT Action\n\n'RDP-IN-103':\nIn the FROM: field put the authenticated users name (if it is for the access to his own PC) \n       or the 'Allow-RDP' groupname (if it is for the access to a shared computer).\nIn the TO: field put the Ext_123-RDP_103 SNAT Action\n\n```\n\nTo have some control over the happening, you should also turn on logging for these rules.\n\nBut that's it. Upload to the FB and enjoy.\n\nIn this case, the SNAT action is not really a simplification. But if you have some more general SNAT e.g. for some server, you would need just one 'reusable' SNAT action for all the rules, that connect from one external IP address to that server. When also port translation joins the game, the SNAT action is not 'reusable', so you can't see the benefit of it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to set up NAT on a WatchGuard firewall to allow RDP access to three internal PCs using a single external IP address (123.123.123.123) on different ports (3111, 3112, 3113). Which of the following steps is NOT correct in configuring this setup?\n\nA) Create three SNAT actions, each mapping 123.123.123.123 to a different internal IP (10.10.10.101, 10.10.10.102, 10.10.10.103) on port 3389\n\nB) Create a custom service template called SNAT-RDP with TCP port range 3111-3113\n\nC) Create three firewall rules, each using one of the SNAT actions in the TO field and the authenticated user or group in the FROM field\n\nD) Configure the SNAT actions to use ports 3111, 3112, and 3113 for the external connections instead of 3389\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to keep the internal RDP port as 3389 in the SNAT actions, while the custom port mapping (3111, 3112, 3113) is handled by the firewall rules using the custom SNAT-RDP service template.

Such users are no more *new* and they don't need reputation points for finding dupes (they can simply earn the badge by closing more questions).\n\nWe may retract the reputation points in case the question is reopened. This will consider the accuracy.\n\nI also don't think the age of the question should be considered. Closing old questions is a good thing, but to avoid any kind of abuse we may consider a *flag ban* if a user is giving a lot of duplicate flags that are not followed by a closure (no one agrees with his/her duplicate suggestion).\n\nI would also increase the threshold for the badges to have something like:\n\n* Bronze badge: 50\n* Silver badge: 300\n* Gold badge: 1500"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the proposal, what is the main goal of incentivizing users to find duplicate questions on Stack Overflow?\n\nA) To increase the reputation points of new users\nB) To encourage users to answer more questions\nC) To improve search results and prevent fragmentation of information\nD) To make it easier for users to close old questions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The main goal of incentivizing users to find duplicate questions, as stated in the documentation, is to improve search results and prevent fragmentation of information.

This is great on other sites that encourage subjective polls/discussions, but here it's a problem because there's no way to know whether one of these answers is better than another. They're all equally plausible, and this sort of thing never has hard statistics to go look up, so whose answer do I upvote? Whose do you accept?\n\nAnd that's why the best questions are the ones that start out with a clear problem statement. While we don't do tool recommendations (those are fraught with similar issues), there are plenty of questions you could ask about, such as whether the single event loop model of asynchronous programming is a good idea for a CPU\\-bound web service. For focused, goal\\-oriented questions like that (assuming you provided more details of course), we can clearly tell if one answer is more helpful than another, and everything just works.\n\n(Note that this is not intended to be an accurate description of *all* the good, on\\-topic questions we have here, just the subset that I believe comes closest to what you asked today.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason why the original question about JavaScript and Node.js was closed on Software Engineering Stack Exchange?\n\nA) The question was too technical and required expert knowledge\nB) The question was too broad and opinion-based, inviting multiple equally valid answers\nC) The question was off-topic for the Software Engineering site\nD) The question was poorly formatted and difficult to read\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The original question was closed primarily because it was too broad and opinion-based.

Sometimes there are layers to these functions, so that `func1` calls `func2` calls `func3` calls `func4`, where a parameter of `func4` is passed through all the way from `func1`. In this case, it would not make sense to make any of these parameters instance/class attributes.\n\nA 1\\-layer example:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    # Calculate E with my_func args\n    E = some_calculations(A, B)\n\n    # Call helper, passing through some parameters\n    return helper(C=C, D=D, E=E)\n\ndef helper(c, d, e):\n    return some_other_calculations(C, D, E)\n\n```\n\nI'm trying to write some dosctrings for these functions, and I am having trouble formulating a way to effecitvely document the arguments that are passed through to the helper function(s).\n\nIn particular, I see a few options:\n\n### Method 1\n\nPoint to `helper`'s dosctring:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: See `helper` \n    :param D: See `helper`\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Only ever have to update/maintain one description of a given parameter\n\n**CON:** If we add another function `outer_func` that calls `my_func` and passes `C` and `D` to it, which in turn passes `C` and `D` to helper, we will have to point to either `my_func` or `helper`.\n\nIn the former case this would lead to another forwarding, daisy\\-chaining the reader through multiple dosctrings just to get a description. In the latter case, it would be unclear where in `outer_func` that `helper` is called.\n\n### Method 2\n\nSimply copy the description for each function that uses it\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Do not have to look through other functions to understand the argument\n\n**CON:** Obviously, multiple descriptions will have to be maintained. Also, it may difficult to describe the parameters without reference to the functions which use them, in which case you are probably forwarding them to the other functions anyway. This effectively leads to the cons of method 1 without the pro.\n\n### Method 3\n\nBrief description \\+ forwarding\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: Brief parameter C description.

Doing this exposes implementation details that are not relevant to the use case your function fulfills. Instead, use the docstring comments to describe that parameter within the context of the method that calls the helper.\n\nThe docstring comments for the helper method should probably be very general. Presumably the helper is used in a larger number of use cases, therefore the phrasing used to describe the helper method parameters will be very generic. The docstring comments for the method which calls the helper should be use case\\-specific.\n\nThe names of functions chosen for the question are too generic to give you specific advice. Instead, let's use a contrived example that at least gives us a concrete use case.\n\nSay you have a method which formats the price for an entire shopping cart. That method calls a helper to format a number as currency (the helper method).\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nIn each case, phrase docstring comments so they make sense within the context the method gets used. The `format_currency` method is general purpose, so the words used to describe the parameters should also be general purpose. Frankly, even the parameter names should be general purpose:\n\n```py\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  # :param amount: The amount to format as currency\n  # :param currency_format: A currency format string\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nThe words \"amount\" and \"currency format\" can be applied to any use case where you have a number that should be formatted as currency.\n\nThe `format_shopping_cart_price` method is use case\\-specific: it formats the total price of a shopping cart as currency. Even though the `currency_format` parameter is simply passed to the helper method, the docstring comment can be tailored to the use case of formatting the shopping cart price:\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  # :param shopping_cart: The shopping cart whose total price should be formatted as currency\n  # :param currency_format: The currency format string used to format the shopping cart price\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\n```\n\nIn the example above, the term \"amount\" is basically replaced by \"shopping cart price\". Copying and pasting docstring comments, while easy, isn't necessarily desirable. You miss opportunities to use docstring comments to communicate use case\\-specific information that aids other programmers in calling your methods.\n\nI'll end this with *one more* possible solution to this conundrum. Does a \"helper\" method need docstring comments? Does your other function need docstring comments? By carefully choosing class, method, and parameter names you can often skip writing comments. The names of things are enough of a description that docstring comments are extra work for no extra value."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When writing docstrings for functions that pass parameters to helper functions, which approach is most recommended according to the expert advice given?\n\nA) Always refer to the helper function's docstring for parameter descriptions\nB) Copy and paste parameter descriptions across all functions that use them\nC) Provide brief descriptions and refer to helper functions for more details\nD) Tailor parameter descriptions to the specific context of each function, without mentioning implementation details\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The expert advice emphasizes describing parameters within the context of each specific function, rather than exposing implementation details like parameter passing. This approach allows for more meaningful, use case-specific documentation without unnecessarily revealing internal function calls. Options A, B, and C all have drawbacks mentioned in the discussion, such as creating chains of references, maintenance issues with duplicated descriptions, or unnecessarily exposing implementation details.

According to the documentation, the user needs to boot into Boot Camp natively, make a backup of the \"Windows/inf/volume.inf\" file, and then replace it with a modified version provided by Parallels. This solution addresses the issue of Parallels not recognizing the Boot Camp partition properly and allows the user to run the Windows installation through Parallels.\n\nOption A is incorrect because updating Boot Camp drivers alone won't solve the Parallels recognition issue.

When I asked them where they got the phrase, they always say they learned it from their high school grammar lessons.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is probably due to difficulty with prepositions, for which it is harder to learn by rules than by experience! The preposition \"by\" is used in \"X by X\" where \"X\" is a noun to adverbially specify that the main verb is performed to each \"X\" in the context one at a time. Some examples are:\n\n> one by one (one at a time)\n> \n> \n> line by line (one line at a time)\n> \n> \n> case by case (one case at a time)\n> \n> \n> day by day (one day at a time)\n\nIn contrast, the adverbial phrase \"X to X\" specifies that the main verb is performed to the \"X\"s in the context from one to another.
