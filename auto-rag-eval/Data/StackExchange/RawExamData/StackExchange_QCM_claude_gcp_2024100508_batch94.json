But with respect to what? Is there an inertial frame that we can attach at the earth's position with respect to which we can measure the angular velocity unambiguously? And I think we can answer that by looking at the sun and neglecting for a moment the Earth's rotation around the sun. Every time we see the Sun rising we conclude that the Earth has completed a full revolution around it's axis.\n\nNow suppose we ask this question about the Sun's revolution. Is there an inertial system with respect to which we can measure the Sun's total angular momentum? And moving on to larger length scales, what about the Milky way center that the sun rotates around? Does this structure continue and for how many levels? \n\nAnd when we finally ask the question about the angular momentum of the entire universe (trying to leave out gravity and space\\-time curvature for a moment, just the usual flat space\\-time) must we not conclude that the total angular momentum of the universe is plain zero because space is rotating itself with the universe? I mean there is no structure greater than the universe to give us a handle, so what would such a frame depend upon?\n\nAny impressions, thoughts or ideas appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The linear velocity of a reference frame is a relative quantity. It is always measured relative to another reference frame. In contrast, the angular velocity of a reference frame is an absolute quantity, which can be measured unambiguously.\n\nThe reason is that only non\\-rotating reference frames are inertial (they satisfy Newton's first law and fictitious forces are absent). In a rotating reference frame, we can measure fictitious forces ([centrifugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force) and [Coriolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force)), and conclude that the frame is non\\-inertial. The strength of the fictitious forces is directly proportional to the absolute angular velocity of the frame.\n\nA concrete implementation of this measurement is [Foucault's pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum), which measures the rotation of the Earth's reference frame. If the Earth was rotating with period 24 hours in an otherwise empty universe (with no sun, stars or other objects), we would still use Foucault's pendulum to detect this rotation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A scientist on a distant planet wants to determine if their planet is rotating.

A Foucault pendulum can detect absolute rotation by demonstrating the presence of Coriolis forces, which are only present in rotating reference frames. This method works even in an otherwise empty universe.\nD) is incorrect because escape velocity is primarily determined by a planet's mass and radius, not its rotation.\n\nThe key point is that angular velocity is an absolute quantity that can be measured without reference to external objects, unlike linear velocity which is always relative.

Along the way we develop and compare *five* variants of the $\\\\chi^2$ test.\n\n---\n\n**Fisher's test is not applicable** because you have two independent samples. Assuming you decided beforehand how large each sample should be, the column counts (\"marginals\") are indeed fixed, as assumed by that test. But (I presume) you had no predetermined control over the total numbers of each ethnicity that would be observed, so the row counts (their marginals) are *not* fixed. That is contrary to what Fisher's test assumes.\n\n(Fisher's test would indeed apply if these data had arisen from a single collection of $45$ subjects who were randomly divided by the experimenter into two groups of predetermined sizes $23$ and $22$, as is often done in controlled experiments.)\n\n### The Chi\\-squared Test\n\nIn these data the total count is $45$ for $5\\\\times 2\\=10$ table entries, producing a mean count of $4\\.5$ spread through two columns of roughly equal totals ($23$ and $22$). This is starting to get into the range where rules of thumb suggest the $\\\\chi^2$ statistic\\-\\-which is just a number measuring a discrepancy between the two ethnicity distributions\\-\\-may have an approximate $\\\\chi^2$ distribution. Let us therefore begin by computing the statistic and its associated p\\-value. (I am using `R` for these calculations.)\n\n```\nx <- cbind(A=c(1,3,1,3,15), B=c(2,0,0,8,12))\nchisq.test(x)\n\n```\n\nThe output is \n\n> X\\-squared \\= 6\\.9206, df \\= 4, p\\-value \\= 0\\.1401\n\nalong with a warning that \"Chi\\-squared approximation may be incorrect.\" Fair enough. But since the reported p\\-value is not extreme\\-\\-so we're not reaching far into the tails of the distribution of the statistic\\-\\-we can expect this p\\-value to be fairly accurate. Let's see.\n\n### Simulating the Chi\\-squared P\\-value\n\nOne way to check is to simulate the true distribution of the $\\\\chi^2$ statistic. `R` offers a \"Monte Carlo\" test.\n\n```\nchisq.test(x, simulate.p.value=TRUE, B=1e5)\n\n```\n\nUsing $100,000$ iterations (and repeating that several times), this test reports a p\\-value consistently near $0\\.130$: reasonably close to the original p\\-value of $0\\.1401$.\n\n(If I am reading the `R` source code for `chisq.test` correctly, in each Monte\\-Carlo iteration it computes a $\\\\chi^2$ statistic comparing the simulated data to the estimates obtained from the original data (rather than to estimates obtained from the marginals of the simulated data, as is performed in a true $\\\\chi^2$ test). It is difficult to see how this is directly applicable to the original hypothesis. The `R` manual refers us to Hope, A. C. A. (1968\\) A simplified Monte Carlo significance test procedure. *J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B* **30**, 582\u2013598\\. I cannot find in that paper any justification for what `R` is doing; in particular, the paper uses independent tests of each simulated sample to assess goodness of fit for continuous distributions, whereas the `R` software conducts a series of *dependent* tests to assess independence among samples involving discrete distributions.)\n\n### Going Deeper\n\n**Another approach is to bootstrap the test.** This procedure uses the data to estimate the parameters under the null hypothesis (that the two samples are from the same population), then repeatedly replicates the data\\-collection process by drawing new values according to that distribution. By studying the distribution of $\\\\chi^2$ statistics that arise, we can see where the actual $\\\\chi^2$ statistic fits\\-\\-and decide whether it is sufficiently extreme to warrant rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\nThe row marginals let us estimate the relative proportions of each ethnicity under the null hypothesis: `Ethnicity_1` was observed $(2\\+1\\)/45$ of the time, etc. Each bootstrap iteration draws two independent samples from this hypothesized distribution, one of size $23$ and another of size $22$, and computes the $\\\\chi^2$ statistic for these two samples.\n\nWhen you try that, **you will stumble upon a very interesting phenomenon:** because ethnicities 2 and 3 were observed rarely, in many simulated samples *they are not observed at all.* This makes it impossible to calculate a $\\\\chi^2$ statistic based on all five ethnicities! (It would require you to divide by zero.) What to do?\n\n1. You could just compute the $\\\\chi^2$ statistic based on the ethnicities actually observed, even when only three or four different ones appear among the two samples. When I do this with $10,000$ iterations, I obtain a p\\-value of $0\\.086$.\n2. You could compute the $\\\\chi^2$ statistic only in those simulations where all five ethnicities were observed. This time I compute a p\\-value of $0\\.108$. (Less than $60\\\\%$ of all simulations included all five ethnicities.)\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe have obtained a range of p\\-values from $0\\.086$ through $0\\.140$, some more legitimately applicable than others. (The Fisher Exact test p\\-value of $0\\.119$, by the way, fits within this range.) If your criterion for a significant result is more stringent than $8\\.6\\\\%$, there is no problem: you will not reject the null hypothesis and so you needn't worry over which tests really are applicable. But if your criterion lies within this range (such as $10\\\\%$), then **your choice of test matters.**\n\nAs the preceding efforts at simulation showed so clearly, which test to use depends on your application. Do you know that only five ethnicities *could* have been observed? Or are you tracking only the ethnicities that happened to appear in your samples? From the gap in numbering between 2 and 4 I would guess that `Ethnicity_3` might be possible but was not observed. As such, if you choose to use a $\\\\chi^2$ statistic based *only on the ethnicities observed*, then you are in situation (1\\) and you should report a p\\-value of $0\\.086$. If you had collected the data differently\\-\\-for example, by augmenting the sample sizes until at least one of each ethnicity appeared in the dataset\\-\\-then an approach comparable to (2\\) would be more appropriate. **The key is to reproduce faithfully all details of your actual sampling procedure within the simulation so that you obtain an honest representation of the distribution of your test statistic.**\n\n---\n\n### Planning Follow\\-on Studies\n\nIt may be worth remarking that even if you view this range of results as being immaterial\\-\\-you would make the same decision regardless\\-\\-the choice of test can nevertheless make a big difference if you plan to conduct additional experiments in the hope of demonstrating an effect. Under that assumption, by using a p\\-value of $0\\.086$ (and adopting a significance threshold of $0\\.05$) you would need a dataset approximately $(Z\\_{0\\.05}/Z\\_{0\\.086})^2 \\= 1\\.45$ times as great as the current one, whereas by using a p\\-value of $0\\.140$ you would want to collect $2\\.32$ times as much data, which will cost $60\\\\%$ more to do.\n\n(The \"$Z\\_{\\*}$\" are quantiles of a standard Normal distribution, invoked here as a rough approximation to a $\\\\chi^2$ power and sample size analysis. The point is not to do an accurate power analysis, but only to observe that it takes relatively few additional data to lower a p\\-value that is near $0\\.05$ to below $0\\.05$ \\-\\- assuming the effect is real! \\-\\- compared to the amount of data needed to lower a p\\-value that is far from $0\\.05$ to below $0\\.05$.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing the ethnic makeup of two independent sample populations, A and B.

My question if whether the isoperimetric inequality holds for the mean shadow instead of perimeter: if $A,B$ are (open, say) subsets of the plane with equal area, and if $B$ is a disk, is the mean shadow of $A$ larger that the mean shadow of $B$ ?\n\nThe inequality is true if $A$ is convex, and we can assume that $A$ is a disjoint union of convex sets (since taking the convex hull of a connected set does not change the mean shadow).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you noticed, it is sufficient to consider the case \n$$F\\=\\\\bigcup\\_{i\\=1}^n F\\_i$$ \nwhere $F\\_1$, $F\\_2,\\\\dots, F\\_n$ are disjoint convex figures with nonempty interior. \nLet $s$ be mean shadow of $F$.\nDenote by $K$ the convex hull of all $F$.\nNote that  \n\n$$\\\\mathop{\\\\rm length}(\\\\partial K\\\\cap F)\\\\le s.$$\n\nWe will prove the following claim: *one can bite from $F$ some arbitrary small area $a$ so that mean shadow decrease by amount almost $\\\\ge 2{\\\\cdot}\\\\pi{\\\\cdot}\\\\tfrac{a}s$ (say $\\\\ge 2{\\\\cdot}\\\\pi{\\\\cdot}\\\\tfrac{a}s{\\\\cdot}(1\\-\\\\tfrac{a}{s^2})$ will do)*.\nOnce it is proved, we can bite whole $F$ by very small pieces, when nothing remains you will add things up and get the inequality you need.\n\nThe claim is easy to prove in case if $\\\\partial F$ has a corner (i.e., the curvature of $\\\\partial F$ has an atom at some point).\nNote that the total curvature of $\\\\partial K$ is $2{\\\\cdot}\\\\pi$,\ntherefore there is a point $p\\\\in \\\\partial K$ with curvature $\\\\ge 2{\\\\cdot}\\\\pi{\\\\cdot}\\\\tfrac1s$.\nThe point $p$ has to lie on $\\\\partial F$ since $\\\\partial K\\\\backslash \\\\partial F$ is a collection of line segments. Moreover, if there are no corners, we can assume that $p$ is not an end of segment of $\\\\partial K\\\\cap F$.\n\nThis proof is a bit technical to formalize, but this is possible.\n(If I would have to write it down, I would better find an other one.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a set F in the plane that is a disjoint union of n convex figures F_1, F_2, ..., F_n with non-empty interiors. Let s be the mean shadow of F, and K be the convex hull of all F_i. Which of the following statements is true regarding the isoperimetric inequality for mean shadows?\n\nA) The mean shadow of F is always equal to the perimeter of its convex hull K.\n\nB) It's impossible to reduce the mean shadow of F by removing small areas from its boundary.\n\nC) One can remove an arbitrarily small area a from F such that the mean shadow decreases by approximately 2\u03c0(a/s), allowing for a proof of the isoperimetric inequality for mean shadows.\n\nD) The isoperimetric inequality for mean shadows only holds if F is a single convex set.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key insight from the documentation is that it's possible to \"bite\" a small area a from F in such a way that the mean shadow decreases by approximately 2\u03c0(a/s). This property allows for an iterative process of removing small areas from F while keeping track of the decrease in mean shadow. By continuing this process until F is completely removed, one can prove that the isoperimetric inequality holds for mean shadows, even for non-convex sets that are unions of convex pieces. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the mean shadow is not necessarily equal to the perimeter of the convex hull. Option B is false, as the proof strategy relies on the ability to reduce the mean shadow by removing small areas. Option D is too restrictive, as the proof strategy works for unions of convex sets, not just single convex sets."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/16", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/97538", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/32633/"], "docs_id": 97538, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I realize there is one other question on this issue with no real answers only counter questions to the op that question is here\n\n[https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/79516/how\\-to\\-add\\-an\\-ad\\-from\\-adsense\\-to\\-my\\-magento](https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/79516/how-to-add-an-ad-from-adsense-to-my-magento)\n\nbut I am specifying what page and I will be more attentive then the other op with follow ups.\n\ngoogle adsense is only a small snippet of code, but Im gonna be honest I understand all the blocks and page and phtml like I understand Cyrillic languages...

But in this case it's added to the right column and that's actually not in the Product view.\n\nSo it all depends on the place you want the Adsense snippet. For explanation sake I'll pick a spot but I suggest you read up on layout XML with [this article](http://magebase.com/magento-tutorials/demystifying-magentos-layout-xml-part-1/) so you'll get a better understanding to move it around.\n\nSo let's create a static block called `adsense_code`.

Our layout XML would like like following\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<layout version=\"0.1.0\">\n    <catalog_product_view>\n        <reference name=\"product.info\">\n            <block type=\"cms/block\" name=\"adsense_code\">\n                <action method=\"setBlockId\"><block_id>adsense_code</block_id></action>\n            </block>\n        </reference>\n        <reference name=\"product.info.options.wrapper.bottom\">\n           <action method=\"append\"><block>adsense_code</block></action>\n        </reference>\n    </catalog_product_view>\n</layout>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to add Google AdSense to your Magento product pages.

It involves creating a static block called 'adsense_code' to contain the AdSense snippet, and then using local.xml to properly place this block within the product view. The XML code in option B correctly references the product info block, creates the adsense_code block, and then appends it to the product.info.options.wrapper.bottom block, which will display it in the desired location on product pages.

However, it also contains directives for the [PBS scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System). This is a system often found in high performance clusters where multiple users need to be able to submit jobs that are then put into a queuing system and launched when the resources become available.\n\nIn general, any lines in a shell script that start with a `#` are comments and are ignored by the shell script interpreter (e.g. bash). This is most often used for commenting code, but a famous exception is the [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`) which is ignored by the shell interpreter (it starts with an `#`), but is read by the kernel to decide what interpreter should be given the script.\n\nPBS uses a similar approach: the `#PBS` comments are read by PBS when setting up the parameters for the job that is described in the shell script. So, this line:\n\n```\n#PBS  -l mem=900mb,walltime=25000:00:00,cput=25000:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=1\n\n```\n\nis telling PBS to run this with 900M of memory, on a single node and whatever else the various options may mean.\n\nFinally, the `cd $PBS_DIRECTORY` is a normal shell command. `$PBS_DIRECTORY` is a variable which, presumably, has been set to point to the directory where the work should be performed. So the first step in the script is to `cd` into that directory, to move into it, and then run the `sample_file.x` script located in that directory.\n\nFor any more detail than this, please consult the administrator of the PBS cluster you are using."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is preparing to submit a job to a high-performance computing cluster using PBS (Portable Batch System).

Nevertheless, in [an answer on MO](https://mathoverflow.net/a/111987/), **@jbc** (inactive on MO since 2013 and with no real name or contact information available) claims that the theorem can be stated in much more generality, for Hausdorff completely regular spaces (which suggests that Urysohn's lemma is indeed the essential ingredient here). Unfortunately, no detail or bibliography is given in that answer.

This locally convex topology was introduced in the case of a locally compact space by R.C.

It can be succinctly described as the finest locally convex topology which agrees with that of compact convergence on the unit ball for the supremum norm and the dual is the space of bounded Radon measures. One of many references: \"Bounded measures in topological spaces\" by Fremlin, Garling and Haydon (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 25 (1972\\) 115\\-135\\).

The generalization of Riesz's representation theorem for non-locally-compact spaces involves using the strict topology on C^b(X) (the space of bounded continuous functions) and is valid for completely regular Hausdorff spaces. This approach was developed by various authors in the 1960s and 1970s, building on R.C.

Which of the following correctly expresses the adjoint f\u0304 : W \u2192 V satisfying \u27e8v, f\u0304(w)\u27e9V = \u27e8f(v), w\u27e9W for all v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W?\n\nA) f\u0304 = (\u03c6RV)^(-1) \u2218 f* \u2218 \u03c6RW\nB) f\u0304 = \u03c6RV \u2218 f* \u2218 (\u03c6RW)^(-1)\nC) f\u0304 = (\u03c6RV)^(-1) \u2218 (f*)^(-1) \u2218 \u03c6RW\nD) f\u0304 = \u03c6RV \u2218 f \u2218 (\u03c6RW)^(-1)\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct expression for the adjoint f\u0304 is (\u03c6RV)^(-1) \u2218 f* \u2218 \u03c6RW. This can be verified by following these steps:\n\n1. For any v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W, we need to show that \u27e8v, f\u0304(w)\u27e9V = \u27e8f(v), w\u27e9W.\n2. Using the definition of \u03c6RW, we have \u03c6RW(w)(f(v)) = \u27e8f(v), w\u27e9W.\n3. Apply f* to both sides: f*(\u03c6RW(w))(v) = \u27e8f(v), w\u27e9W.\n4. Now, \u03c6RV(f\u0304(w))(v) = \u27e8v, f\u0304(w)\u27e9V by definition of \u03c6RV.\n5. For these to be equal, we must have f\u0304(w) = (\u03c6RV)^(-1)(f*(\u03c6RW(w))).\n6. This is exactly what the expression (\u03c6RV)^(-1) \u2218 f* \u2218 \u03c6RW represents.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect as they don't properly combine the maps to achieve the required equality.

Yet this does not seem a serious obstruction.

"Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the TikZ diagram:\n\nQuestion: In the control loop diagram shown, what would be the effect of increasing the gain Kp while keeping all other parameters constant?\n\nA) It would decrease the system's response time but increase overshoot\nB) It would increase the system's response time and decrease overshoot\nC) It would have no effect on the system's response as Kp only affects the proportional term\nD) It would eliminate steady-state error completely\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Increasing Kp (the proportional gain) in a control system typically results in:\n1. Faster response time: The system reacts more quickly to errors.\n2. Increased overshoot: The system is more likely to exceed the target value before settling.\n3. Decreased steady-state error: The final error is reduced, but not eliminated.\n4. Potential instability: If Kp is increased too much, the system may become unstable.\n\nOption A correctly captures the main effects. B is incorrect as it reverses the effects. C is wrong because Kp does affect the system's response significantly. D is incorrect because while Kp reduces steady-state error, it doesn't eliminate it completely (that's typically the role of the integral term Ki)."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/18", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352339", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/196044/"], "docs_id": 352339, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Thanks for checking this one out.\n\n```\njonathan@melange:~$ top\n\ntop - 05:21:08 up 44 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.21, 1.68, 1.98\nTasks: 351 total,   2 running, 349 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n%Cpu(s):  4.3 us, 14.0 sy,  2.1 ni, 70.4 id,  8.9 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.3 si,  0.0 st\nGiB Mem :   15.579 total,    0.173 free,    4.141 used,   11.264 buff/cache\nGiB Swap:   15.910 total,   15.868 free,    0.042 used.   11.014 avail Mem \n\n  PID  PPID   UID USER     RUSER    TTY          TIME+  %CPU %MEM S COMMAND                                                                                                                                   \n   67     2     0 root     root     ?         22:22.40 100.0  0.0 R kworker/0:1 \n\n```\n\nThe setup \\- ubuntu 16\\.10\\. 4\\.8\\.0\\-41\\-generic.

So I had tried disabling/uninstalling long running processes such as dropbox, insync (google drive), crashplan, keybase, Variety background, multiload indicator, psensor, guake. (I feel like I have a pretty slick setup most of the time...) but nothing seemed to help.\n\nThere had been other questions lurking around suggesting malfunctioning wifi, nvidia drivers or usb drivers. But nothing in my logs were suggesting this either. Somewhat thankful as almost always the solution in those was simply find newer nvidia drivers, update the kernel, or \"Deal with it.\" My laptop is pretty up to date already, I have no enterprise reason to stay on 16\\.04 and I already have the nvidia ppa activated, as with the intel drivers, so this wasn't much help. \n\nPerhaps the kworker was actually the result of the laptop overheating \\-\\> cpu throttling \\+ cpu fan management. Not the cause. As suggested by [Stop cpu from overheating](https://askubuntu.com/questions/391474/stop-cpu-from-overheating/875872) So I've just used some compressed air to clean out the fans (didn't think this would be a problem on a laptop only 9 months old yet there was actually a bit of dust) and investigating the thermal\\-conf.xml which suggests that the fan kicks in at 55\u00b0C (although still working on what I can do here) \n\nThinking this may actually be the solution. Will report back soon.\n\nUpdate 2\n========\n\nSo doing the Acer bios update totally ruined everything related to my secureboot setup and corrupted the the efi files so it took me a few days to work out how to regenerate the ubuntu efi keys and the and windows efi keys. \n\nI tried cleaning out the dust, and it definitely helped for the two days until I started with the bios issues. \n\nBut the kworker is back (and yes it is the same as far as I can tell). I also have some more information now. I can see that the cpu is not throttling down, but rather staying at the maximum. The fan is running, but the device is only sitting around the 60degree mark, so i wouldn't call this serious over heating.\n\nThe commands from the other thread require raising to the root user, not just using sudo. so sudo su and then getting the stack trace gives the following. \n\n```\n[<ffffffff98a9dcea>] worker_thread+0xca/0x500\n[<ffffffff98aa40d8>] kthread+0xd8/0xf0\n[<ffffffff992a071f>] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x40\n[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff\n\n```\n\nDoesn't look particularly helpful to me.\n\nLong time later....\n-------------------\n\nI see this answer is still getting lots of views so I thought I'd add in what I remember of what else happened. I run an Aspire V 15 Nitro 592G laptop with Nvidia gpu. The wifi is flaky, the mic doesn't work, Nvidia drivers cause the gnome shell and monitors to repeatedly crash and more. This isn't the best ubuntu machine even though it's pretty powerful when it is working. To be honest, I now run Ubuntu 17\\.10, and I still have major issues making this machine work.\n\nI wrote that cleaning the fan seemed to help in the comments. It certainly made things quieter. But I suspect it was actually a combination of the following:\n\n* Tracker (the full text search daemon) \\-\\> crazy resource hog\n* The wifi drivers at the time were just awful\n* Variety (wallpaper switcher) \\+ dual monitor \\+ nvidia \\+ gnome shell \\-\\> unreliable monitor setup and massive ram leak on gnome shell,\n* the multiload shell extension also a memory leak\n\nI realise this doesn't help new users with different problems. Perhaps one day things will be easier to diagnose, until then; good luck!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question seems abandoned as it wasn't updated anymore, but I'll give it a try anyway:\nI have seen quite some where excessive interrupts occurred, slowing the machine down.

It has not to do with the sample size and is *not* influenced by the sample size.\n\n**Cohen's $\\\\bf d$** is a statistic that estimates the standardized mean difference.\n\nFor Cohen's $d$, which is a statistic computed with a sample, there will be an influence of the sample size on the distribution of the statistic. This difference is that for increasing sample size the Cohen's $d$ will be more close to the standardized mean difference (but the expectation value of Cohen's $d$ will not be affected by the sample size).\n\n**The t\\-statistic** is the observed effect size divided by the standard error of the observed effect size. This error becomes smaller for larger samples, and the t\\-statistic will be larger for smaller samples (provided the effect size is non\\-zero).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nWhen we estimate the difference in the means of two populations, $\\\\mu\\_2\\- \\\\mu \\_1$, then we have the following expressions for the standard mean difference, Cohen's $d$, and the t\\-statistic.\n\n**Standardized mean difference** is a property of the populations and independent from $n$ and just the difference in the (true) population means divided by the (true) standard deviation of the populations (more complex formula's exist when the population's standard deviations are unequal)\n\n$$SMD \\= \\\\frac{\\\\mu\\_2\\- \\\\mu\\_1}{\\\\sigma}$$\n\nBelow is an example for two Gaussian distributed populations. The effect size is in this case two standard deviations so $SMD\\=2$.\n\n[![standardized mean difference](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Y5ez.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Y5ez.png)\n\n**Cohen's $\\\\bf d$** is a statistic that estimates the standardized mean difference from the sample in which case you have\n\n$${d} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}\\_1\\-\\\\bar{x}\\_2}{s}$$\n\nwith the sample means $\\\\bar{x}\\_i$, and $s$ the estimate of the distribution standard deviations (for the simple case that the deviations are assumed to be equal, $s$ is the pooled standard deviation).\n\n**The t\\-statistic**\n\n$$t \\= \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}\\_2\\-\\\\bar{x}\\_1}{S.E.(\\\\bar{x}\\_2\\-\\\\bar{x}\\_1\\)} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}\\_2\\-\\\\bar{x}\\_1}{s \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{2/n}} \\= \\\\sqrt{n/2} d\n$$\n\nThis standard error of the difference between the sample means, $S.E.(\\\\bar{x}\\_2\\-\\\\bar{x}\\_1\\) \\= s \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{2/n}$, scales with the sample size and becomes smaller for larger samples.\n\n---\n\nSee below an example of the distribution of ${d}$ and $t$ for different sample sizes when the true standardized effect size is $SMD\\=0\\.1$. (the distributions will be non\\-central t\\-distributions)\n\n[![distribution](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0hY8.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0hY8.png)\n\nFor a given effect size, when ${n}$ increases then the t\\-statistic can become very high. This is because the error of the observed effect size becomes smaller.\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen's $d$, will approach the real effect size (standardized mean difference) and does not become bigger for increasing sample size $n$.\n\nEven very small effect sizes (in terms of the standardized mean difference) can result in a large t\\-statistic as long as $\\\\sqrt{n}$ (the sample size) is large enough."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing the effectiveness of two teaching methods. They collect data from 100 students for each method and calculate both Cohen's d and the t-statistic. If they were to repeat the study with 400 students per group, keeping all other factors constant, what would likely happen?\n\nA) Both Cohen's d and the t-statistic would increase proportionally\nB) Cohen's d would remain approximately the same, while the t-statistic would double\nC) The t-statistic would remain the same, while Cohen's d would decrease\nD) Cohen's d would remain approximately the same, while the t-statistic would approximately double\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Cohen's d is an estimate of the standardized mean difference and is not directly affected by sample size. It may become more precise with a larger sample, but its expected value doesn't change systematically with sample size. On the other hand, the t-statistic is proportional to the square root of the sample size (t = \u221a(n/2) * d). When the sample size increases from 100 to 400 (a factor of 4), the square root of this factor is 2. Therefore, the t-statistic would approximately double, while Cohen's d would remain roughly the same."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/07", "source": ["https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111", "https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4/"], "docs_id": 111, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A (I believe) well intentioned developer is asking for the details of a Magento [security exploit](https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/4534/why-is-using-base-url-in-a-production-server-not-recommended).

This approach allows for setting a minimum threshold (2V in this case) while still maintaining linear behavior above that threshold. The voltage divider can be used to scale the input appropriately, and the diode can prevent the voltage from dropping below the desired minimum. This solution addresses both the need for a minimum voltage (to ensure the linear regulator has sufficient headroom) and the requirement for linear behavior above the threshold, which are key aspects of the original problem statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a simple zener diode in series would not provide the desired linear behavior above the threshold.

This means that any piece of the disk would experience a force proportional to its area. Keep this in mind.\n\nFurthermore since the torque created by the friction at any point is proportional to this point's distance to the center of the disk, it makes sense to model the disk as many concentric rings. The reason this is sensible is that both the area of such a ring, thus the force on the ring, and the distance for all the points on it to the center can be written in terms of the radius of each ring. Thus it is easy to express the torque on each ring which is just the product of the distance and the force.\n\nThen you can add all the disks back together to acquire the total torque on the disk. This simply means integrating with respect to r from 0 to R.\n\nThis is a sketch of the friction forces acting on different points. Note even they all have the same magnitude, the ones closer to the rim creates a larger torque. Also note all of them creates a torque in the same direction.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)"}, "answer": "Question: A circular disk of radius R is rotating on a horizontal surface with uniform friction.

This is because:\n\n1. The friction force is uniformly distributed, meaning it's proportional to the area of each ring.\n2. The torque at any point is proportional to its distance from the center.\n3. For each concentric ring, all points are equidistant from the center, simplifying calculations.\n4. The total torque can be found by integrating the contributions from all rings from the center (r=0) to the edge (r=R).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the torque is actually least at the center and greatest at the edge. Option B is incorrect because the torque varies with distance from the center. Option C, while capturing the idea that torque increases from center to edge, oversimplifies the relationship.

Usually, I work with either MDs or social scientists, and odds ratios are the preferred metric. But I am now working with a client in economics/law and she wants the marginal effects and their standard errors, and she wants them at the means of the other variables.\n\nThis isn't easy in SAS, but, with help from tech support, I found that you can do this with PROC NLMIXED, I believe you then need the out \\= der option. Something like this\n\n```\nproc nlmixed data=olivia.small;\n  p=1/(1+exp(-(Intercept+ba*log_fund_age + bb*log_fund_size + bc*yield + bd*loaded + be*log_assets)));\n  model vote_code_num ~ binomial(1,p);\n  parms intercept 36.43 ba -14.55 bb -0.98 bc -0.37 bd 2.2 be -0.07;\n  predict p*(1-p)*ba out=a der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bb out=b der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bc out=c der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bd out=d der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*be out=e der;\n  where year = 2003;\n  run;\n\n```\n\nbut then the output data sets a, b, c, d and e have the derivatives and their standard deviations for each observation in the data set, not for the mean of the other variables. It's easy to find the mean of all those derivatives, but 1\\) Is that the same as the marginal at the mean of the other variables? and 2\\) How then to get the standard errors?\n\nPeter\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some people would find such 'marginal effects' difficult to interpret and non\\-unique. There are other ways to get 'marginal effects' in binary logistic regression. Because of non\\-collapsibility of the odds ratio, marginal estimates are not well defined in general, and they can represent quantities that are not weighted averages over the factors you are unconditioning on. Mitch Gail has an example where the partial odds ratio for an exposure x2 is 9 for both x1\\=0 and x1\\=1 but is 5\\.44 when not holding x1 constant.\n\n```\n@ARTICLE{gai84bia,\n  author = {Gail, M.H. and Wieand, S. and Piantadosi, S.},\n  year = 1984,\n  title = {Biased estimates of treatment effect in randomized experiments with\n          nonlinear regressions and omitted covariates},\n  journal = Biometrika,\n  volume = 71,\n  pages = {431-444},\n  annote = {covariable adjustment;bias if omitted covariables and model is\n           nonlinear}\n}\n\n```\n\nI wonder also whether you meant 'marginal effect' or 'effect on the original scale'. That would involve two different considerations. Effects on the log odds scale are easier to deal with, and you can relate odds ratios to absolute risk changes (as a function of starting risk) using a simple chart."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In logistic regression, when calculating marginal effects at the means of other variables using SAS PROC NLMIXED, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) The mean of derivatives across all observations is exactly equivalent to the marginal effect at the mean of other variables.\n\nB) Marginal effects are always well-defined and consistent across different model specifications in logistic regression.\n\nC) The 'out=der' option in PROC NLMIXED directly provides the standard errors for marginal effects at the means.\n\nD) Marginal effects in logistic regression can be influenced by non-collapsibility of odds ratios and may not represent simple weighted averages over unconditional factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the complexities and potential issues with marginal effects in logistic regression, as discussed in the documentation. The non-collapsibility of odds ratios can lead to marginal estimates that are not well-defined in general and may not represent simple weighted averages over factors you are unconditioning on.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's easy to calculate the mean of derivatives, this is not necessarily the same as the marginal effect at the mean of other variables.\n\nOption B is false because the documentation explicitly states that marginal estimates are not well-defined in general due to non-collapsibility of odds ratios.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the 'out=der' option provides derivatives and standard deviations for each observation, it doesn't directly give the standard errors for marginal effects at the means.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complexities involved in calculating and interpreting marginal effects in logistic regression, particularly when using SAS PROC NLMIXED."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/27", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/440400", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/287066/"], "docs_id": 440400, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I launch connexion ssh to use rsync command in terminal and I would like to shutdown my computer, but I need to let run the process rsync.\n\nI executed this command on a remote host.
