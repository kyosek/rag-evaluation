However, certain kind of code constructs or statements are more prone to behave differently in \"Debug\" and \"Release\", or differently in \"x86\" or \"x64\". There are obvious things\n\n* like explicit tests `#if DEBUG`, and not so obvious things like that\n* subtle differences in floating point precision.\n\nTo find out what applies to your case, the only sensible way is, IMHO, to gain experience with the code base in stake. This might be done by inspection, or by occasionally running the tests using a different configuration. And it will take some time, depending of the size of the code base. In a large code base, you will probably find out that there are some parts or components where testing with one configuration is not enough, and others (hopefully the bigger part) do not need more than one configuration for testing.\n\nIf you ask which configuration you should prefer for unit testing, then it is IMHO obvious that\n\n* the configuration/platform used by the team in the code\\-compile\\-test\\-debug cycle needs to be the one for which you run the unit tests always\n* the configuration(s)/platforms used by your team for deployment should be tested before deployment, especially if you suspect they could behave differently.\n\nYou should also make sure everyone in the team is aware of the potential differences, and everyone who used some `#if DEBUG` statement is very careful about not changing any behaviour which could become relevant for testing."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is working on a large C# .NET project hosted on GitHub with Appveyor CI and code coverage.

The correct answer (B) aligns with the best practices suggested in the top answer while addressing the specific concerns of the development stage.\n\nRunning tests on the Debug configuration provides more information during development, as mentioned in the question. Using the Any CPU platform is generally sufficient for most C# .NET projects, as the language runs in the CLR and platform-specific issues are less common. \n\nHowever, the periodic testing of other combinations acknowledges that some code constructs may behave differently under various configurations or platforms (e.g., #if DEBUG statements or floating-point precision differences). This approach balances efficiency with thoroughness, allowing developers to catch most issues quickly while still identifying potential configuration-specific problems.\n\nOption A is too time-consuming for the development stage, though it might be appropriate for release builds. Option C introduces unnecessary complexity without clear benefits. Option D misses the advantages of using the Debug configuration during development and may slow down the development process unnecessarily.\n\nThis strategy also leaves room for adjusting the testing approach as the team gains more experience with the codebase, which is a key point mentioned in the top answer.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The original equation ln|x| = y + C, when exponentiated, yields |x| = eCey. \n2. Let A = eC. Since C is arbitrary, A is an arbitrary positive constant.\n3.

F2 rotates around F1, which is fixed, and F3 rotates around F2. The engineer needs to determine the angular velocity of F3 with respect to F1 (\u03c931). Which of the following statements best explains why the simple addition of angular velocities (\u03c931 = \u03c932 + \u03c921) is incorrect in this scenario?\n\nA) The rotation matrices R32 and R21 are not commutative, leading to a non-linear relationship between the angular velocities.\nB) The angular velocity vectors must be transformed to a common frame of reference before addition, using the rotation matrix R32.\nC) The cross-product nature of angular velocity calculations introduces a frame-dependent term that is not accounted for in simple addition.\nD) The time derivatives of the rotation matrices introduce additional terms that are neglected in the simple addition formula.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key insight in this problem is that angular velocities are frame-dependent vectors. When adding angular velocities from different frames, we must ensure they are expressed in the same frame of reference. In the derivation, we see that the correct formula is \u03c931 = \u03c932 + R32\u03c921, not simply \u03c932 + \u03c921.\n\nThe rotation matrix R32 transforms \u03c921 from the F2 frame to the F3 frame before addition. This transformation is crucial because \u03c932 is already expressed in the F3 frame, while \u03c921 is initially expressed in the F2 frame.

Given the SSH config file snippet and the debug output, why is the ProxyCommand not being applied when connecting to the 'foo' host, and what modification would correctly apply both the short name mapping and the proxy command?\n\nA) The ProxyCommand is not applied because the 'foo' host entry appears before the wildcard entry. Moving the wildcard entry to the top of the config file would solve the issue.\n\nB) The Hostname directive in the 'foo' entry is overriding the wildcard match. Removing the Hostname directive and using Host foo*.a.b.c.d would apply both the short name and proxy command.\n\nC) The SSH client is not processing wildcard entries correctly. Updating to the latest SSH version would resolve this behavior.\n\nD) The order of precedence in SSH config processing prevents the wildcard from matching after a specific host entry. Using a conditional block with Match would allow both the specific host and wildcard to apply.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The issue arises from the SSH config file's processing order and precedence rules. When SSH processes the config file, it applies options in the order they appear, with more specific Host patterns taking precedence over more general ones. In this case, the 'foo' host entry is processed first and fully matched, so SSH stops looking for additional matching patterns.\n\nTo solve this, we need to use a more sophisticated configuration that allows both the specific host mapping and the wildcard proxy command to apply. The Match directive in SSH config files can be used to create conditional blocks that are evaluated in order but can still apply based on various criteria.\n\nA modified config that would work could look like this:\n\n```\nHost foo bar\n    Hostname %h001.a.b.c.d\n\nMatch host *.a.b.c.d\n    ProxyCommand ssh -A -l sds XXX.YYY.ZZZ.TTT nc %h %p\n\nHost *\n    ForwardAgent yes\n```\n\nThis setup would first apply the Hostname mapping for 'foo' and 'bar', then evaluate the Match condition for the proxy command, and finally apply the global ForwardAgent setting.

Option D (telescoping caster) is a creative solution that matches the user's initial idea, but it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential points of failure.\n\nThe pivot angle adjustment (Option C) elegantly solves both issues by causing the gate to rise as it opens, clearing the higher part of the driveway without skidding.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The issue persists across reboots but can be temporarily resolved by using a different keyboard, suggesting a system-level problem rather than hardware failure (eliminating A).\n\n2. While oh-my-zsh was mentioned, it's unlikely to cause such a specific key malfunction that persists in Recovery Mode (ruling out B).\n\n3. The user mentions being unable to reset NVRAM using the standard key combination, which is a strong indicator that NVRAM settings may be corrupted. NVRAM stores various low-level system settings, including keyboard configurations.\n\n4.

However there is a difference between the two if you do reflection. \n\nExample:\n\n```\npublic class InterfaceTest {\n\n    static interface I {\n        public void doSomething();\n    }\n\n    static class A implements I {\n        public void doSomething() {\n        }    \n    }    \n\n    static class B extends A {   \n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(A.class.getInterfaces().length);\n\n        for (Class i:A.class.getInterfaces()) {\n            System.out.println(i.getName());\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(B.class.getInterfaces().length);\n\n        for (Class i:B.class.getInterfaces()) {\n            System.out.println(i.getName());\n        }\n\n        B b=new B();\n\n        System.out.println(b instanceof I);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis outputs:\n\n> ```\n>  1 \n>  InterfaceTest$I \n>  0 \n>  true\n> \n> ```\n\nSo while b is an instance of I of course, `B.class.getInterfaces()` does not return any. You have to traverse the class hierarchy to find all interfaces that are implemented. \n\nAn example where this is relevant is using JPA AttributeConverters with Hibernate. An attribute converter has to implement the JPA AttributeConverter interface directly at this point, implementing it on a base class does not work. While this is reported as a bug in Hibernate, it still showcases that there are slight differences depending where you implement the interface and the use case."}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software architect is reviewing a codebase and notices the following class hierarchy:\n\n```java\npublic interface Map<K,V> { /* ... */ }\npublic abstract class AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V> { /* ... */ }\npublic class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V> { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nThe architect is considering refactoring the HashMap class to remove the explicit Map<K,V> interface implementation. Which of the following statements best describes the potential impact of this change?\n\nA) It would break the functionality of HashMap, as it would no longer implement the Map interface.\nB) It would have no impact on functionality but might affect performance due to changes in method dispatch.\nC) It would only affect reflection-based operations that directly query HashMap's implemented interfaces.\nD) It would cause compile-time errors in any code that uses HashMap as a Map type.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of interface implementation inheritance and its implications. The key points are:\n\n1. HashMap would still functionally implement the Map interface through its inheritance of AbstractMap, which implements Map. This rules out options A and D.\n\n2. There would be no change in method dispatch or performance, as the actual method implementations remain the same. This eliminates option B.\n\n3. The correct answer is C because the main difference lies in reflection-based operations. As demonstrated in the example code provided in the documentation, calling getInterfaces() on the class object would return different results:\n\n   - Before refactoring: HashMap.class.getInterfaces() would include Map\n   - After refactoring: HashMap.class.getInterfaces() would return an empty array\n\nThis change would only be noticeable in scenarios where code explicitly checks for directly implemented interfaces using reflection, such as in some frameworks or libraries that use reflection for configuration or runtime behavior determination.\n\nThe question requires analysis of the class hierarchy, understanding of interface implementation inheritance, and application of this knowledge to a real-world scenario involving reflection and potential refactoring impacts. It also touches on the subtle differences in how interfaces are reported through reflection versus the actual behavior of the class, which is a higher-level concept in Java programming."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/12/09", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/402234", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/352639/"], "docs_id": 402234, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am reading Kafka, the definitive guide and I came across the below point for consumers.\n\nheartbeat.interval.ms must be lower than session.timeout.ms, and is usually set to one\\-third of the timeout value.\n\nMay I know why is it, I thought both should be the same, let's say if I set the session.timeout.ms to 10s and heartbeat to 3s, then if the consumer takes longer time to process the record, the broker already sends the poll and figures out the consumer already dead and rebalances, in that case, what is the purpose of session timeout property.

Option C addresses these issues directly:\n\n1. setInterval doesn't maintain the correct 'this' context, leading to the error \"Object [object global] has no method 'render'\".

Binding the render function correctly ensures that 'this' refers to the view instance.\n\nOption A (WebSockets) would be overkill for this scenario and require significant backend changes. Option B (custom event system) is unnecessary when Backbone already provides mechanisms for updating views.

I don't know any particularly good explanation or mnemonic. \"Creature\" and \"creative\" are actually both pronounced somewhat irregularly/unpredictably, although in different ways (in \"creature\", the sequence \"ea\" is pronounced in an unexpected way, and in \"creative\", the stress is placed in an unexpected place).\n\nSome background material: the digraph \"ea\" is often used in English to represent a single vowel sound, and its etymological origin in these contexts is usually a single vowel sound or diphthong: e.g. \"beak\" from French *bec,* \"bean\" from Old English *b\u0113an* (Old English \"ea\" was a diphthong, not a sequence of two separate vowels), \"treat\" from Old French *tretier, traitier* (modern French \"traiter\").\n\nThe spelling and pronunciation of \"creature\" appears at first glance to fit this pattern, but actually, the \"ea\" in \"creature\" doesn't come from a historical monophthong or diphthong. It comes from two vowels in hiatus (the OED says \"\\< Anglo\\-Norman *creatur,* Anglo\\-Norman and Old French *criature,* Anglo\\-Norman and Old French, Middle French *creature* (French *cr\u00e9ature*)\").\n\nRegarding the pronunciation, the OED says\n\n> The stem vowel appears to have shown some variation in early modern English, but generally to have shown the reflex of Middle English open *\u0113*; the different developments of this sound in different regional varieties of English largely account for the variation in the stem vowel which is found subsequently. (There is also very limited evidence for a trisyllabic pronunciation in early modern English, on the same pattern as creation n.) critter n. shows a variant with shortening of the stem vowel after raising to /i\u02d0/. The realization of the second syllable varied in Middle English and early modern English according to whether this syllable showed secondary stress; pronunciations of the type /\u02c8kri\u02d0t\u0283\u0259/ ultimately reflect pronunciations with secondary stress, while pronunciations of the type /\u02c8kri\u02d0t\u0259/ ultimately reflect pronunciations without such secondary stress. Compare forms at nature n., pasture n., etc.\n\nIn trisyllabic or polysyllabic words taken from French, stress often seems to move \"back\" from the final syllable in an alternating fashion. I'll give an example: the word \"relative\", from French *relatif/relative,* is thought to have been pronounced with stress on the final syllable in the past (the modern French pronunciation sounds to an English ear like it has final stress). The present\\-day stress on the first syllable in English can be explained as a strengthening of an originally secondary stress on the first syllable. Alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables is known to be a tendency in English pronunciation: for example, compare the pronunciation of \"prohibit\", where the first syllable has no secondary stress because it immediately precedes a stressed syllable, to that of \"prohibition\", which seems to have secondary stress on the first syllable.\n\nAnyway, the alternating\\-stress explanation is a bit hypothetical, but we can verify that many trisyllables and polysyllables from French are currently pronounced with stress on the third\\-to\\-last or \"antepenultimate\" syllable. (There are classes of regular or predictable exceptions to this stress pattern, like words with a \"heavy\" consonant cluster after the second\\-to\\-last syllable, e.g. \"collective\" or \"deceptive\".)\n\n### Creative\n\n\"Creative\" is an *unpredictable* exception to the general tendency towards antepenultimate stress in words of this type: there is no obvious explanation for its penult stress that I know of (it only has a single consonant after the stressed syllable).\n\nIt seems likely that \"creative\" has a stressed, \"long\" vowel in the second\\-to\\-last syllable in part due to influence from the verb \"create\". Word\\-final stress is somewhat regular in certain types of disyllabic verbs. (See this question for notes on the pronunciation of other adjectives ending in *\\-ative*: [Is there a rule for the position of the accent (stressed sound) in words ending with \\-ative?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/307413/is-there-a-rule-for-the-position-of-the-accent-stressed-sound-in-words-ending))\n\nIt may also be related to the use of penult stress in the noun \"creator\": note that all speakers use this stress pattern for this word, while some other nouns ending in \"\\-ator\" like \"narrator\" and \"dictator\" may be pronounced with antepenultimate stress.\n\n### Creature\n\nAccording to the alternating\\-stress/antepenultimate stress principle (which, as mentioned, doesn't always accurately predict the position of stress in modern English), the word \"creature\" would have been expected to be pronounced something like /\u02c8kri\u02d0\u0259t\u0283\u0259r/. However, in a sequence of a stressed vowel immediately followed by unstressed schwa, like \\[i\u02d0\u0259], it's relatively easy for the schwa to be lost. That seems to have happened here. It's also possible that the disyllabic pronunciation was strengthened by the many words spelled with \"ea\" representing a monophthong, including the now\\-rhyming \"feature\" from Old French *feture, faiture.*"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A linguistics professor is explaining the pronunciation differences between \"creature\" and \"creative\" to a class of advanced English learners.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. \"Creature\" follows the general tendency towards antepenultimate stress in trisyllabic words borrowed from French, although it has undergone further simplification to become disyllabic (/\u02c8kri\u02d0t\u0283\u0259/). This fits the alternating-stress principle mentioned in the documentation.\n\n2. \"Creative\" is explicitly described as an \"unpredictable exception\" to the antepenultimate stress pattern.

Scalability: By using separate variable files for each environment (e.g., staging.yml, production.yml), the approach allows for easy management of multiple environments without modifying playbooks.\n\n2. Security: Sensitive information like database credentials are kept in separate files, which can be more easily secured and excluded from version control.\n\n3.

The newest version of GDAL has support for mounting the S3 bucket so that if we need to say a crop a small portion of the image, we can operate directly on that smaller portion. Alas, as the feature only was released on the stable branch in January, I haven't found any documentation on it. So the solution should use the VSI3 system in the newest release of GDAL or otherwise smartly uses the system to prevent the user from needing to download the entire image to an EBS drive to operate on it.\n\nThat is to say the bounty will be awarded to answer that uses the VSI APIs found in the newest versions of GDAL so that the whole file does not need to be read into memory or disk. Also, we the buckets we use are not always public so many of the HTTP tricks being posted won't work in many of our situations.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've found when something isn't particularly well documented in GDAL, that looking through their tests can be useful.\n\nThe [`/vsis3` test module](https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/gcore/vsis3.py) has some simple examples, though it doesn't have any examples of actually reading chunks. \n\nI've cobbled together the code below based on the test module, but I'm unable to test as GDAL /vsis3 requires credentials and I don't have an AWS account.\n\n```py\n\"\"\"This should read from the Sentinal-2 public dataset\n   More info - http://sentinel-pds.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\"\"\"\n\nfrom osgeo import gdal\nimport numpy as np\n\n# These only need to be set if they're not already in the environment,\n# ~/.aws/config, or you're running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role.\ngdal.SetConfigOption('AWS_REGION', 'eu-central-1')\ngdal.SetConfigOption('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'MY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')\ngdal.SetConfigOption('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'MY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')\ngdal.SetConfigOption('AWS_SESSION_TOKEN', 'MY_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN')\n\n# 'sentinel-pds' is the S3 bucket name\npath = '/vsis3/sentinel-pds/tiles/10/S/DG/2015/12/7/0/B01.jp2'\nds = gdal.Open(path)\n\nband = ds.GetRasterBand(1)\n\nxoff, yoff, xcount, ycount = (0, 0, 10, 10)\nnp_array = band.ReadAsArray(xoff, yoff, xcount, ycount)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about GDAL and S3 bucket file access, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working on a project that requires processing large satellite imagery stored in an S3 bucket. They need to crop small portions of these images for analysis without downloading entire files. Which of the following approaches using GDAL's new feature would be most efficient and secure for this task?\n\nA) Use GDAL's HTTP access to directly read public S3 URLs for the imagery\nB) Download entire images to an EBS drive, then use standard GDAL functions for cropping\nC) Utilize GDAL's /vsis3 virtual file system with proper AWS credentials configuration\nD) Implement a custom S3 client in Python to stream image data in small chunks\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and secure approach for this scenario is to utilize GDAL's /vsis3 virtual file system with proper AWS credentials configuration. This solution addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It uses the new GDAL feature that allows random reading of S3 bucket files, which is specifically mentioned as a recent addition.\n2. It avoids downloading the entire file, which was stated as a limitation of previous methods.\n3. It works with non-public buckets, unlike HTTP-based solutions that only work for public data.\n4. It allows for direct operations on smaller portions of the image, which meets the requirement of cropping without downloading the whole file.\n5. It can be integrated into Python scripts, satisfying the bonus requirement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only works for public buckets and doesn't utilize the new GDAL feature. Option B is explicitly stated as inefficient in the documentation. Option D, while potentially workable, doesn't leverage the built-in GDAL functionality and would likely be more complex to implement correctly.\n\nThe correct approach involves setting up the AWS credentials (as shown in the code example), using the /vsis3 prefix in the file path, and then using GDAL's ReadAsArray function to read only the required portion of the image. This method combines the efficiency of partial reads with the security of proper credential management, making it the most suitable solution for the described scenario."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/17", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/345565", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1456253/"], "docs_id": 345565, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently ran across the [crash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crash \"show questions tagged 'crash'\") tag.

The top answer provides a crucial insight:\n\n1/(2-1)...(2^(k-1)-1) + 1/(2-1)...(2^k-1) = 2^k/(2-1)...(2^k-1)\n\nThis identity shows that each pair of consecutive terms in the series can be combined into a single term of the form 2^k/(2-1)...(2^k-1), which is exactly the k-th term of the original series f(2,1).\n\nWhen we sum these combined terms, we get an alternating series where each term cancels out with the next, leaving only the first term (which is 1) and the limit of the last term (which approaches 0 as k approaches infinity). Thus, the sum of the entire series is exactly 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nThis explanation demonstrates why f(2,1) is precisely zero, not just approximately zero.

Each number (a, b, c) can be thought of as a coordinate in a 3D space, with each axis ranging from 0 to 1.

It aligns with the recommendation that managers should have a \"readily available 'pipeline' of in-house and/or lower priority projects that can be assigned on demand.\"\n2.

I've left the answers largely as they were but added to them, so at present this forms a progression of understanding; the last parts are where the best information is.\n\nShort answer: the Wikipedia page (at the time the question was posted) \\- and the OP's formula, which seems to have been the same \\- are simply wrong, for at least three different reasons. I'll leave my original discussion (which assumed that the OP and Wikipedia had it right) since that explains some issues. Better discussion follows later. The short advice: simply forget Doane. If you *must* use it, use what Wikipedia says *now*, around April 2013 (I fixed it; hopefully someone doesn't reinsert it later).\n\n---\n\nI believe that formula must refer to excess kurtosis; my reason for that is that it modifies a formula for normal data to account for non\\-normal data so you'd expect it to reproduce the unmodified one at the normal. It does that if you use excess kurtosis.\n\nThat does, however, raise the problem that the term in the log can go negative with large samples (indeed, it's possible to be be $\\\\leq 0$ at quite small $n$). I'd suggest not using it with negative excess kurtosis (I'd never use it beyond unimodality anyway; once things get multimodal you want to apply the excess kurtosis idea to *each* mode, not smooth over them!), though with mild cases (excess kurtosis just less than 0\\) and modest sample sizes it won't be a big issue.\n\nI'd also suggest that in any case it's going to give far too few bins at large sample sizes, even when it works as intended.\n\nYou may find this paper (by regular CVer [Rob Hyndman](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/159/rob-hyndman)):\n\n<http://www.robjhyndman.com/papers/sturges.pdf>\n\nof some interest. If Sturges' argument is wrong, Doane's formula has the same problem... as Rob clearly notes in the paper.\n\nIn that paper (and in this [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/862/805)) he gives a nod to the Freedman\\-Diaconis rule. In the paper he also points to the approach mentioned by Matt Wand (he refers to the working paper which doesn't seem to be online, but the subsequent paper is available if you have access):\n\n[http://www.jstor.org/discover/10\\.2307/2684697](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2684697)\n\n\\[Edit: actually a link to the working paper is on the [citeseer page](https://web.archive.org/web/20130427010303/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.9725)]\n\nThat approach involves approximately estimating particular functionals in order to get approximately optimal (in terms of mean integrated squared error, MISE) bin widths for estimating the underlying density. While these work well and give many more bins than Sturges or Doane in general, sometimes I still prefer to use more bins still, though it's usually a very good first attempt.\n\nFrankly I don't know why Wand's approach (or at the very least the Freedman\\-Diaconis rule) isn't a default pretty much everywhere.\n\nR does at least offer the Freedman\\-Diaconis calculation of the number of bins:\n\n```\n nclass.FD(rnorm(100))\n[1] 11\n nclass.FD(runif(100))\n[1] 6\n nclass.FD(rt(100,1))\n[1] 71\n\n```\n\nSee `?nclass.FD`\n\nPersonally, for me that's too few bins in the first two cases at least; I'd double both of those in spite of the fact that it might be a bit noisier than optimal. As $n$ becomes large, I think it does very well in most cases.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI decided to investigate the skewness vs kurtosis issue that @PeterFlom rightly expressed puzzlement at.\n\nI just had a look at the Doane paper wiso linked to (I'd read it before .... but that was almost 30 years ago) \\- it makes no reference to kurtosis at all, only to skewness.\n\nDoane's *actual* formula is: $K\\_e \\= \\\\log\\_2(1\\+\\\\frac{g\\_1}{\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1}})$\n\nwhere $K\\_e$ is the number of added bins, $g\\_1$ is the 3rd moment skewness. \\[Well actually, Doane, following fairly common usage of the time, uses $\\\\sqrt{b\\_1}$ for the *signed* (!) 3rd moment skewness; the origin of this particularly unedifying abuse of notation is quite old and I'm not going to pursue it, except to say that it was quite widespread and understood as including a sign, but even then it frequently led to confusion \\- indeed it looks like it fooled Doane and the referees, or an editor in the Doane paper itself \\- it's fortunately appearing much less often now.]\n\nNow at the normal, $\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1} \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6(n\\-2\\)}{(n\\+1\\)(n\\+3\\)}} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6}{n}}$  \n\n(although that approximation is pretty poor until $n$ is well past 100; Doane uses the first form).\n\nHowever, it seems that along the way someone has tried to adapt it to kurtosis (at the time I write this [Wikipedia has it in terms of kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Histogram&oldid=548769683#Number_of_bins_and_width), for example, and I don't think they made it up) \\- but there's clear reason to believe that the formula is simply wrong (note that the standard error used is that final approximation for the s.e. of the skewness I gave above). I think I've seen this use of kurtosis in several places other than Wikipedia, but besides not being in Doane's paper, it isn't present in Scott's paper, nor the Hyndman paper I point to, nor in Wand's paper. It does seem to have come from somewhere, however (i.e. I am sure it's not original to Wikipedia), because Doane doesn't have the approximation to $\\\\sigma\\_{g\\_1}$. It looks like it's been played with several times before it ended up there; I'd be interested if anyone tracked it down.\n\nIt does look to me like Doane's *argument* should happily *extend* to kurtosis, but the [correct standard error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis#Sample_kurtosis) would have to be used.\n\nHowever, since Doane relies on Sturges and Sturges' argument seems to be flawed, perhaps the entire enterprise is doomed. In any case I have edited the Histogram talk page on wikipedia noting the error.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEdit 3: I have corrected the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width) (but I took the liberty of taking the absolute value of the skewness, otherwise Doane's original formula can't be used for left\\-skewed distributions as it stood \\- clearly for number of bins the sign of the skewness is immaterial). Strictly speaking I should have presented the formula in its original (wrong) form, and then explained why it doesn't make sense but I think that's problematic for several reasons \\- not least that people will be tempted to just copy the formula and ignore an explanation. I believe it actually covers Doane's original intent. In any case it's a vast improvement over the nonsense that was in the original. (Please, anyone who can access the original paper, take a look at it *and* how $\\\\sqrt{b\\_1}$ is defined and check my changes on Wikipedia to make sure it's reasonable \\- there were at least three things wrong \\- the kurtosis, the standard error, and the wrong base of logs, plus Doane's own small error.)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about histogram bin selection algorithms, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is analyzing a large dataset (n = 1,000,000) with a strongly bimodal distribution.

Given the HTML and CSS provided, what is the most effective solution to maintain the central block's position during window resizing?\n\nA) Change the #story div's position from absolute to fixed\nB) Remove the float: right property from the #story div and use margin-left with a percentage value\nC) Set a min-width on the body element equal to the sum of all content widths\nD) Implement a media query to adjust the #story div's position at different breakpoints\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the shifting issue is the combination of fixed width and float: right on the #story div. This causes the div to maintain its alignment with the right side of the browser window while keeping a fixed width, resulting in the leftward shift during resizing.\n\nOption A (changing to position: fixed) would not solve the issue and would create new problems by removing the div from the document flow.\n\nOption B addresses the core issue by removing the float: right property, which is causing the alignment problem. Using a percentage-based margin-left (e.g., margin-left: 27%) allows the content to maintain its relative position as the window resizes, providing a fluid and responsive layout.\n\nOption C (setting a min-width on the body) might prevent some shifting but doesn't address the underlying layout issue and would create horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.\n\nOption D (using media queries) could work as a solution but is more complex than necessary for this particular problem and doesn't address the fundamental cause of the shifting.\n\nThe correct solution (B) aligns with the advice given in the top answer, which suggests either making the width a percentage or removing the float: right and using a left margin.

Of all the careless lines of code recorded in the annals of computer science, this one may stand as the most devastatingly efficient. From interviews with rocketry experts and an analysis prepared for the space agency, a clear path from an arithmetic error to total destruction emerges.\n\nWhat major changes did Flight's 501 failure and the subsequent investigations inspire to the research of safety critical systems and software testing?\n\nI'm not looking for an explanation of the bug itself, but for an explanation of the historical impact of the bug, in terms of research that were inspired from or were directly related to the investigation(s) of the failure. For example this [paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1998ESASP.422..201L) concludes:\n\n> We have used static analysis to:\n> \n> \n> * check the initialization of variables,\n> * provide the exhaustive list of potential data access conflicts for shared variables,\n> * exhaustively list the potential run time errors from the Ada semantics.\n> \n> \n> **To our knowledge this is the first time boolean\\-based and non boolean\\-based static analysis techniques are used to validate industrial programs.**\n\nSimilarly, [this paper](http://spiderman-2.laas.fr/IFIPWG/Workshops&Meetings/40/5-Cousot.pdf)(pdf) notes:\n\n> Abstract interpretation based static program analyses have been used for the\n> static analysis of the embedded ADA software of the Ariane 5 launcher and\n> the ARD.

Still a quite expensive failure but nowhere near the $7 billion figure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically speaking, it was more a case of \"[software rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)\". The flight control software was recycled from the earlier Ariane 4 rocket, a sensible move given how expensive it is to develop software, especially when it's mission critical software which must be tested and verified to far more rigorous standards than most commercial software needs to be. \n\nUnfortunately, nobody bothered testing what effect the change in operating environment would have, or if they did they didn't do said testing to a sufficiently thorough standard. \n\nThe software was built to expect certain parameters to never exceed certain values (thrust, acceleration, fuel consumption rates, vibration levels, etc). In normal flight on an Ariane 4 this wasn't a problem because those parameters would never reach invalid values without something already being spectacularly wrong. The Ariane 5, however, is much more powerful and ranges that would seem to be silly on the 4 could quite easily happen on the 5\\. \n\nI'm not sure what parameter it was that went out of range (it might have been acceleration, I'll have to check), but when it did, the software was unable to cope and suffered an arithmetic overflow for which there had been insufficient error checking and recovery code implemented. The guidance computer started sending garbage to the engine nozzle gimbals, which in turn started pointing the engine nozzle pretty much randomly. The rocket started to tumble and break up, and the automatic self\\-destruct system detected the rocket was now in an unsafe irrecoverable attitude and finished the job. \n\nTo be honest, this incident probably didn't teach any new lessons, as the kind of problems have been unearthed before in all manner of systems, and there are already strategies in place to deal with finding and fixing errors. What the incident did do was ram home the point that being lax in following those strategies can have enormous consequences, in this case millions of dollars of destroyed hardware, some extremely pissed off customers and an ugly dent in the reputation of Arianespace. \n\nThis particular case was especially glaring because a shortcut taken to save money ended up costing a huge amount, both in terms of money and lost reputation. If the software had been tested just as robustly in an Ariane 5 simulated environment as it had been when it was originally developed for Ariane 4, the error surely would have come to light long before the software was installed in launch hardware and put in command of an actual flight. Additionally, if a software developer had deliberately thrown some nonsense input into the software then the error might have even been caught in the Ariane 4 era, as it would have highlighted the fact that the error recovery that was in place was inadequate.\n\nSo in short, it didn't really teach new lessons, but it rammed home the dangers of not remembering old ones. It also demonstrated that the environment within which a software system operates is every bit as important as the software itself. Just because the software is verifiably correct for environment X doesn't mean it's fit for purpose in the similar but distinct environment Y. Finally it highlighted how important it is for mission critical software to be robust enough to deal with circumstances that shouldn't have happened. \n\nContrast flight 501 with Apollo 11 and its computer problems. Whilst the LGC software suffered from a serious glitch during the landing, it was designed to be extremely robust and was able to remain in an operational state in spite of the software alarms that were triggered, without putting any astronauts in danger and still being able to complete its mission."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the Ariane 5 rocket failure and its impact on software testing, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a critical control system for a new spacecraft.

The incident highlighted the critical importance of testing software in the specific environment where it will be used, even if that software has been previously validated in a similar context.\n\nOption A (reusing well-tested software without modification) is incorrect because it mirrors the mistake made with Ariane 5. The failure occurred precisely because software from Ariane 4 was reused without adequate consideration of the new operating environment.\n\nOption B (implementing extensive error checking) is a good practice but doesn't address the root cause of the Ariane 5 failure. While better error handling might have mitigated the consequences, it wouldn't have prevented the underlying issue of software operating outside its designed parameters.\n\nOption D (focusing on performance optimization) misses the point entirely. The Ariane 5 failure was not due to performance issues but to a fundamental mismatch between the software's assumptions and its new operating environment.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the need for thorough testing in accurate simulated environments. This approach would likely have caught the error that led to the Ariane 5 failure, as it would have revealed the mismatch between the software's assumptions and the new rocket's capabilities.

The initial NAS device shipment (B) can significantly reduce the time for the first full backup, which is often the most time-consuming. The business's upload bandwidth (C) is a critical factor as it determines the speed at which data can be sent to the cloud, affecting both initial and incremental backups.\n\nIn contrast, the vendor's cloud network speeds during non-peak hours (D) are less relevant because:\n1. Backups are often scheduled during off-hours anyway, so peak vs. non-peak may not be a significant differentiator.\n2. The bottleneck is more likely to be the business's upload speed rather than the cloud provider's network.\n3.

The ext4 filesystem does support nanosecond resolution for timestamps, including crtime, as mentioned in the documentation link.

This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. It separates configuration from code, making it easier to manage and share different configurations without modifying the Vagrantfile.\n2. YAML is a human-readable format that's easy for team members to understand and edit, even if they're not familiar with Ruby.\n3.

The correct answer is D, and here's why:\n\n1. For any non-negative real number x in S, we know that x \u2264 sup(S). \n2. Squaring both sides (which preserves the inequality for non-negative numbers), we get x^2 \u2264 sup(S)^2.\n3. This means sup(S)^2 is an upper bound for S^2.\n4. By definition, sup(S^2) is the least upper bound of S^2, so sup(S^2) \u2264 sup(S)^2.\n\n5. Conversely, for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists an x in S such that sup(S) - \u03b5 < x \u2264 sup(S).\n6. Squaring both sides: (sup(S) - \u03b5)^2 < x^2 \u2264 sup(S)^2\n7. As \u03b5 approaches 0, (sup(S) - \u03b5)^2 approaches sup(S)^2.\n8.

They've fitted a Poisson regression model, but are concerned about potential overdispersion. Which of the following scenarios would most strongly suggest that a Negative Binomial model might be more appropriate than the Poisson model?\n\nA) The variance of the disease counts increases proportionally with the mean across regions\nB) The variance of the disease counts increases faster than the mean across regions\nC) The variance of the disease counts remains constant across regions, regardless of the mean\nD) The variance of the disease counts decreases as the mean increases across regions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of Poisson distribution properties and their implications in regression modeling, as well as the concept of overdispersion.\n\nIn a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are equal (E[Y] = Var(Y) = \u03bb). This property is reflected in option A, which describes the expected behavior under a well-fitting Poisson model. However, the question asks about a scenario suggesting a Negative Binomial model might be more appropriate.\n\nOption B describes a situation where the variance increases faster than the mean. This is a classic sign of overdispersion, which occurs when the observed variance is greater than what would be expected under a Poisson model. Overdispersion is often addressed by using a Negative Binomial model, which allows for greater variance relative to the mean.\n\nOption C describes a scenario with constant variance, which violates the Poisson assumption but in a different way than what typically leads to using a Negative Binomial model.\n\nOption D describes underdispersion, which is less common and not typically addressed by switching to a Negative Binomial model.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Poisson distribution properties, overdispersion, model selection) and applies them to a real-world scenario (disease count analysis). It tests critical thinking about the relationship between data characteristics and model assumptions, going beyond mere memorization of formulas or definitions."}, "61": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/13", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/499713", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/113754/"], "docs_id": 499713, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to draw something similar to this:[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wkYIt.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wkYIt.png)\n\nI was able to draw the triangles, but I cannot figure out how to easily draw the arrows.

I'll create a question based on the provided documentation about the history of \"Your obedient servant\" in letter closings. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: Based on the historical evidence presented, which of the following best describes the evolution of the phrase \"Your obedient servant\" as a letter closing?\n\nA) It originated in the mid-18th century as a concise alternative to more elaborate closings\nB) It was consistently used from the mid-17th century onwards with little change in frequency\nC) It emerged in the late 18th century as a uniquely American form of letter closing\nD) It started as an elaborate closing in the 17th century and gradually became more concise\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation provides evidence that the phrase \"Your obedient servant\" evolved from more elaborate closings in the 17th century to become a concise and common closing by the late 18th century. Early examples from the 17th century show longer, more ornate closings such as \"Your Lordships Most obliged, and most Obedient, Humble Servant\" (1719). These gradually shortened over time, with \"Your obedient servant\" becoming common by the late 1700s.\n\nThe evidence contradicts option A, as examples of \"Your obedient servant\" are found as early as 1640, well before the mid-18th century. Option B is incorrect because the usage changed over time, becoming more frequent and concise. Option C is not supported, as the phrase was used in both Britain and America. \n\nThe correct answer, D, best captures the evolution described in the document, where the phrase started as part of more elaborate closings in the 17th century and gradually became a shorter, more standard closing by the late 18th century. This evolution reflects a shift from highly ornamental expressions of devotion to more succinct, yet still polite, letter closings."}, "66": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/254662", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/124234/"], "docs_id": 254662, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was meeting a lot of people while I was working in London. \nI met a lot of people while I was working in London. \nWhat is the difference between them? \nI'm not sure about these sentences. \nHow to clear them? \nPlease, explain it easily. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I met a lot of people while I was working in London. \\- The focus here is on \"a lot of people\" and that's what you'd say normally now that you don't live there anymore.\n\nI was meeting a lot of people while I was working in London. \\- You wouldn't say \"I was meeting\" unless you add something more such as, *everyday* or *every weekend* to it.

They want to convey that they frequently interacted with diverse groups of people during their time in London, but are unsure about the most appropriate phrasing. Which of the following sentences best captures this intended meaning while maintaining grammatical accuracy and natural flow?\n\nA) I was meeting a lot of people while I worked in London.\nB) I met a lot of people while I was working in London.\nC) I had been meeting a lot of people while I worked in London.\nD) I have met a lot of people while I was working in London.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including tense usage, emphasis, and context. The correct answer, B, is the most appropriate choice because:\n\n1. It uses the simple past tense \"met\" to describe a completed action in the past, which is suitable for recounting experiences in a memoir.\n2. It employs the past continuous \"was working\" to provide the background context for the main action of meeting people.\n3. This combination effectively conveys the idea that the person met many people throughout their time working in London, without unnecessarily emphasizing the frequency or continuity of the meetings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses \"was meeting,\" which, as the documentation states, would require additional context like \"every day\" or \"every weekend\" to be appropriate.\n\nOption C uses the past perfect continuous \"had been meeting,\" which is unnecessarily complex and doesn't fit the context as well as the simple past.\n\nOption D mixes tenses inappropriately, using present perfect \"have met\" with past continuous \"was working,\" creating a grammatically incorrect sentence.\n\nThis question tests the learner's ability to analyze language use in context, apply grammatical rules, and choose the most natural and effective phrasing for a specific situation, aligning with higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "67": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/01", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/365397", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/49586/"], "docs_id": 365397, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there an exploit in the translators.html file of phpMyAdmin?\n\nThe reason I ask is I have Bad Behavior installed on a server, and that server has a web app that the main index.php ends up handling 404 requests on it, so requests for this file at common paths is being requested quite a bit lately by a bot that fails Bad Behavior's tests.\n\nIt is hitting other servers, but those requests are not causing Bad Behavior to trigger because of no PHP scripts are running with those requests.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From looking around online I don't see an exploit specific to that file.

These requests are triggering Bad Behavior on a server with a custom 404 handling setup, but not on other servers. What is the most likely explanation for this pattern of activity?\n\nA) A zero-day exploit in phpMyAdmin's translator file has been discovered and is being actively exploited\nB) The server with Bad Behavior is misconfigured, causing false positives for legitimate requests\nC) A bot is conducting reconnaissance to identify phpMyAdmin installations across multiple servers\nD) The custom 404 handling on the affected server is inadvertently creating a security vulnerability\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of cybersecurity concepts. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions a bot failing Bad Behavior tests, indicating automated scanning activity.\n2. The requests are targeting a specific file (translators.html) associated with phpMyAdmin, suggesting a focused search for this application.\n3. Multiple servers are being hit, but only the one with custom 404 handling is triggering Bad Behavior, implying the requests themselves are not inherently malicious.\n4. There's no evidence of an actual exploit being used, just repeated requests for a specific file.\n5.

The right hand side is the functional calculus on two elements.\n\nI suppose it makes intuitive sense. It reminds me of the fact that composition respects classical functional calculus but I can't justify it in this case. In any case, I also think it is relevant that $u(a), v(a) \\\\ne 1$. Can anybody formally justify why the boxed equality is true and resolve this technicality?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let $u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{\\-i\\\\} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{1\\\\}$ denote the fractional linear transformation\n$$\nu(z) \\= \\\\frac{z\\-i}{z\\+i}, \\\\qquad z \\\\neq \\-i.\n$$\nIt can be verified that $u$ maps the real axis to bijectively to the unit circle with $1$ excluded, the upper half plane bijectively to the interior of the unit disc, and the lower half plane with $\\-i$ excluded bijectively to the exterior of the unit disc. (It follows that for any self\\-adjoint operator $s$, the operator $u(s)$ is unitary and does not have $1$ in its spectrum. With some work, this could be verified directly from a definition of $u(s)$ as $(s\\-i \\\\mathbf{1})(s\\+i \\\\mathbf{1})^{\\-1}$ if one does not want to appeal to general facts about the functional calculus.)\n\nA short computation shows that $u^{\\-1}: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{1\\\\}$ to $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{\\-i\\\\}$ is given by\n$$\nu^{\\-1}(z) \\= \\\\frac{z\\+1}{i(z\\-1\\)}, \\\\qquad z \\\\neq 1\\.\n$$\nNote also that $\\\\frac{w\\+1}{w\\-1} \\= i u^{\\-1}(w)$ for all $w \\\\neq 1$.\n\nTurning to your problem, the operators denoted by Takesaki as \"$u(a)$\" and \"$v(a)$\" respectively are literally $u(h)$ and $u(k)$ in the sense of the above definition of the function $u$ and the continuous functional calculus. Because $u^{\\-1}$ is given by the formula above, it follows that $(u(h)\\+\\\\mathbf{1})(i(u(h)\\-\\\\mathbf{1}))^{\\-1} \\= h$ and $(u(k)\\+\\\\mathbf{1})(u(k)\\-\\\\mathbf{1})^{\\-1} \\= ik$, again where all of this is interpreted in the sense of the continuous functional calculus.\n\nIt follows that the operator denoted by Takesaki by $g$ applied to the pair \"$u(a), v(a)$\", which is literally $g$ applied to the pair $u(h), u(k)$, is (from the definition of $g$) the function $f$ applied to $u^{\\-1}(u(h)) \\+ i u^{\\-1}(u(k)) \\= h \\+ ik \\= a$, in other words, $f(a)$.\n\nSide note, the operator $u(s)$ is sometimes called the Cayley transform of the self adjoint operator $s$; von Neumann used the Cayley transform and knowledge of the spectral resolution of unitary operators to deduce the spectral resolutions of self adjoint operators.

They encounter an expression involving the composition of functions applied to normal operators. Which of the following statements best explains the equality f(a) = g(u(a), v(a)) in the context of functional calculus?\n\nA) The equality holds because u and v are bijective mappings between the complex plane and the unit circle, allowing for direct composition of functions.\n\nB) The equality is a consequence of the spectral theorem for normal operators, allowing any function of a to be expressed as a composition of simpler functions.\n\nC) The equality results from the Cayley transform properties, where u(a) and v(a) encode the real and imaginary parts of a, respectively, allowing g to reconstruct f(a).\n\nD) The equality follows from the fact that u is a fractional linear transformation, and its inverse can be used to reconstruct the original operator a from u(a) and v(a).\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The equality f(a) = g(u(a), v(a)) is fundamentally based on the properties of the fractional linear transformation u and its inverse. The function u maps the complex plane (minus -i) to the complex plane (minus 1), and importantly, it has an explicit inverse function u^(-1). \n\nThe key to understanding this equality lies in how u(a) and v(a) encode information about the original operator a, and how g is defined to use this information:\n\n1. u(a) is essentially u(h), where h is the self-adjoint part of a.\n2. v(a) is u(k), where k is related to the imaginary part of a.\n3. g is defined as f \u2218 \u03c6, where \u03c6(w,z) = u^(-1)(w) + i * u^(-1)(z).\n\nWhen we apply g to (u(a), v(a)), we're effectively doing:\n\nf(\u03c6(u(h), u(k))) = f(u^(-1)(u(h)) + i * u^(-1)(u(k)))\n\nDue to the properties of u and u^(-1), this simplifies to:\n\nf(h + ik) = f(a)\n\nThis explanation captures the essence of why the equality holds, emphasizing the role of the fractional linear transformation and its inverse in reconstructing the original operator a from u(a) and v(a).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states \"Start a blog instead\" as the recommended solution for sharing knowledge proactively.\n2. Stack Exchange sites, including Stack Overflow, are primarily designed for Q&A format, not for unsolicited knowledge sharing (eliminating options A and B).\n3. Option D, while seemingly helpful, goes against Stack Exchange's editing guidelines and could be seen as vandalism if not directly addressing the original question.\n\nStarting a blog allows the developer to share their knowledge freely without constraints, aligns with the recommendation in the documentation, and doesn't conflict with Stack Exchange's purpose. This solution respects the Q&A nature of Stack Exchange while providing an alternative platform for proactive knowledge sharing.\n\nThe distractors (A, B, and D) represent common misconceptions about how to use Stack Exchange platforms or attempts to modify their core functionality, which requires critical thinking to evaluate against Stack Exchange's philosophy."}, "76": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/03", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/77704", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/28094/"], "docs_id": 77704, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am unsure as to which of these seems more formal.\n\n> My parents will reside with **me** and my family.\n\nor\n\n> My parents will reside with my family and **I**.\n\nOr is there a better (formal) alternative to it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> My parents will reside with **me** and my family.\n\nThis sentence is okay, because if we shorten it, leaving only **me** and omitting \"my familiy\", we notice nothing strange:\n\n> My parents will reside with **me**.\n\nBecause this pronoun is not in subject position, it's okay to use the form **me**. The pronoun is the object of the preposition **with**. Such pronouns are called *[object pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pronoun)*. \n\nYour second sentence is actually considered ungrammatical (but look below for a fuller view):\n\n> My parents will reside with my family and **I**.\n\nWhy? Because **I** is a *[subject pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_pronoun)*, and should not be used in object position. Let's see how the sentence will look if we omit \"my family\":\n\n> My parents will reside with **I**.\n\nThis is a strange\\-sounding sentence. \n\n---\n\nIn \"standard\" English there's a tradition to frown upon the use of **me** in subject position. Why? Because when we omit the \"**and**\\-part\", we get this:\n\n> **Me** will reside with my parents.\n\nSounds a bit strange. The \"correct\" form of the pronoun for subject position is **I**. \n\n---\n\nP.S. When someone attempts to use **I** instead of **me** in object position in order to be more \"formal\", it is called \"*[hypercorrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection#Personal_pronouns)*\". Quoting Wikipedia, \n\n> Jack Lynch, assistant professor of English at Rutgers University, says that correction of \"*me and you*\" to \"*you and I*\" as subject leads people to \"internalize the rule that '*you and I*' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they shouldn't \u2013 such as '*he gave it to you and I*' when it should be '*he gave it to you and me*.'\"\\[7]\n> \n> \n> On the other hand, the linguists Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum claim that utterances such as \"*They invited Sandy and I*\" are \"heard constantly in the conversation of people whose status as speakers of Standard English is clear\"; and that \"Those who condemn it simply assume that the case of a pronoun in a coordination must be the same as when it stands alone. Actual usage is in conflict with this assumption.\"\\[8]\n\nThat's a nice observation by H\\&P. My test with leaving out \"my family\" and dissolving the coordination is invalid, from this point of view. \n\nSo let's say that's basically how the awkwardness of **I** in object position and of **me** is subject position is usually explained. Linguists are arguing about whether it is really ungrammatical. \"[The jury is still out](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_jury_is_still_out)\", as they say. \n\nThe take\\-home message is that your sentence 2 will be marked off as erroneous if you take an English language test. \n\n---\n\nRelated posts:\n\n* [Is it \"Tom and I\" or \"Tom and me\" in \"Keep Tom and I/me updated\"?](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/23535/is-it-i-or-me-in-keep-tom-and-i-me-updated) \\-\\- the deepest answer ***[is in this post by F.E.](https://ell.stackexchange.com/a/59914/2127)***.

Option B is the most appropriate choice for several reasons:\n\n1. It uses the object pronoun \"me\" correctly after the preposition \"with,\" which is grammatically standard.\n2. It avoids the potential hypercorrection seen in option A, where \"I\" is incorrectly used in object position.\n3. While some linguists argue that coordinated phrases like \"my family and I\" in object position may be acceptable in spoken Standard English, option B is still considered more formally correct and would be marked as such in language tests.\n4. It maintains the original intended meaning without altering the sentence structure significantly.\n\nOption A represents a common hypercorrection and would be marked as erroneous in formal contexts. Option C incorrectly uses the reflexive pronoun \"myself,\" which is not appropriate in this context.

The correct answer, A, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the primary association of \"nighty night\" with nighttime sleep, as mentioned in the documentation (\"it makes most sense when the child is going to bed for the night\").\n2. It creates a distinction between nighttime sleep and daytime naps, which can help children understand different types of rest periods.\n3.

This approach balances consistency (using specific phrases for specific times) with the flexibility mentioned in the documentation (\"People do often use it when a child is taking a nap, even if that's in the middle of the day\").\n\nOption B is less ideal because it doesn't distinguish between different types of sleep, which could be confusing for children.

I currently have forced air duct system. My gas furnace was installed in 1985 and is rusting out, and I'm not sure about the air conditioner.\n\nExperience\n==========\n\nI had a local big name HVAC company come out to give me an estimate. His sizing calculation consisted of going through my home and counting the registers and returns (not every room in my home has returns). He didn't take any measurements of the rooms ... which seemed odd to me. \n\nQuestion\n========\n\nIs there a certain kind of professional that I can hire to inspect my home and design a heating and cooling system ? I think I'd like this person to be different from the person that will be selling the system to me.\n\nQuestions I would like this person to answer:\n\n* What is the correct size system for my home?\n* What is appropriate type of system for my home: heat pump, gas furnace, etc ?\n* Are my existing ducts adequate ?\n* What should I consider when choosing one system over an other?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In theory this is what HVAC professionals are supposed to do. In practice, most of them rely on antiquated rules of thumb to size equipment and use existing ductwork, even if it has major problems. A certified energy rater is who you're looking for and who will be able to definitively tell you what you need to know, but you can learn a lot yourself to be a more informed consumer.\n\nThe correct size of equipment for your home is discovered by doing a Manual J load calculation. You can do an 85% as good approximation yourself in 15 minutes here: <http://www.loadcalc.net>\n\nFor a 1930s house, unless major air sealing, insulation, and window replacement work has taken place, the load may be as high as 1 ton of AC per 500 square feet and 30 heating BTUs per square foot. But those would be worst\\-case scenario numbers; run them yourself with that web tool and get a ballpark estimate of your house's loads.\n\nThe most appropriate type of equipment for your house depends on your climate, your budget, and the fuels available. If you live in a mostly\\-cold climate and have natural gas, then a gas furnace makes the most sense. If you live in a mixed hot\\-and\\-cold climate but it doesn't get *too* cold, then a conventional heat pump may be a good bet. If it gets both very hot and very cold, then AC \\+ a gas furnace may make the most sense if you have gas; if you don't, then a Japanese ducted mini\\-split or conventional heat pump is a better choice.\n\nAs for your existing ducts, it's impossible to say whether they're adequate or not without knowing anything about them. But they may be inadequate if they are in the attic, or if they are in a vented crawlspace, or if any rooms get much hotter or colder and other ones, or if a lot of air leaks out of them.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that you're not really hiring someone to design your home HVAC system; your home already has an HVAC system (well, the \"H\" and \"AC\" parts, at least). If every part of it is unsalvageably wrong, expect to pay mucho dinero to completely replace everything. New equipment and new ductwork and all the demolition and drywall repair entailed by such a job will probably cost you $15k or more... possibly much more if you live in a high\\-labor\\-cost area. Consider how much you actually need to replace and how much you can simply live with, especially considering that many comfort\\-related deficiencies in a house's heating and cooling infrastructure can be ameliorated by improving its insulation and air sealing. There are many such opportunities in an old house, including the extremely low\\-hanging fruit of air\\-sealing the basement, weatherstripping any old windows, and adding more attic floor insulation.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to do all this work before replacing your equipment, since if you buy correctly\\-sized units now, they will be too big after you perform the work. You can mitigate this to a certain extent by purchasing \"modulating,\" \"variable speed,\" or \"two\\-stage\" units, as they are capable of reducing their output at low\\-load conditions. In theory you won't have to use your furnace for another 4\\+ months at least, so you have some time to tackle those sorts of projects before having to replace it, which will allow you to purchase a smaller one and save money, or a better one for the same price."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about HVAC systems, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner with a 1930s house is considering replacing their outdated HVAC system. The house is located in a region with both hot summers and cold winters, and has not undergone any significant insulation or air sealing improvements. Which of the following approaches would likely be the most cost-effective and energy-efficient long-term solution?\n\nA) Immediately replace the existing system with a high-efficiency heat pump sized based on current home conditions\nB) Install a new gas furnace and air conditioner combo, sized using the \"1 ton per 500 square feet\" rule of thumb\nC) Perform air sealing and insulation improvements first, then install a modulating gas furnace and properly sized air conditioner\nD) Replace the ductwork and install a ductless mini-split system without addressing insulation issues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple factors presented in the documentation. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes the importance of improving insulation and air sealing before replacing equipment, especially in older homes. This allows for proper sizing of new equipment and improves overall efficiency.\n\n2. A modulating gas furnace is mentioned as a good option for homes that experience both hot and cold temperatures, as it can adjust its output based on demand.\n\n3. The answer addresses the need for proper sizing after improvements, rather than using rules of thumb or oversizing based on current conditions.\n\n4. It considers long-term cost-effectiveness by improving the home's envelope first, which will reduce the load on any new system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't address the home's efficiency issues first and may result in an oversized system after improvements. Option B is wrong because it uses an outdated sizing method without considering home improvements. Option D neglects the important step of improving insulation, which is crucial for overall efficiency.

Some of these rules are given on [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_relief_depiction#Contour_lines). The main recommendation when simplifying contours it to preserve the terrain main characteristics.\n\nSmoothing the contours independently do not prevent them to overlap: It is advised to smooth the DTM first. A traditional Gaussian smoothing with a suitable parameter depending on the target resolution allows to erase the small details. A drawback is that DTM smoothing fills the valleys and depressions, and flattens the ridges and peaks. Using the douglass\\-peucker filter algorithm like [in this paper](http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVII/congress/1_pdf/129.pdf) may be a solution. There are also [number of methods](http://www.citeulike.org/user/jgaffuri/tag/contour) based on the use of contour smoothing algorithms constrained by the drainage network or a skeleton. Finally, to prevent the contours to overlap in sloppy parts, it is possible [to erase them locally](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/wam/MackSteven2006.pdf) or also [deform them](http://icaci.org/documents/ICC_proceedings/ICC2009/html/refer/19_2.pdf)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about generating contours from DEMs, here's a challenging question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An environmental consultant is tasked with creating contour maps from a high-resolution DEM (1m resolution, 1km x 1km area) for a proposed construction site. The client requests three sets of contours at 250mm, 1m, and 5m intervals.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate approach because:\n\n1. It recognizes that different contour intervals (250mm, 1m, 5m) require different levels of detail preservation, aligning with Imhof's cartographic rules to represent relief.\n2. Smoothing the DEM before generating contours is recommended to prevent contour overlap and preserve terrain characteristics.\n3. More aggressive smoothing for larger intervals (e.g., 5m) helps eliminate small details that would be irrelevant at that scale, while less smoothing for smaller intervals (e.g., 250mm) preserves necessary detail.\n4. This approach avoids the pitfalls of option A, which could lead to inconsistent or overlapping contours.\n5. It's more nuanced than option B, which applies the same level of smoothing to all intervals.\n6. While option D introduces an advanced technique, it doesn't address the need for different detail levels at different contour intervals.\n\nThis solution balances the preservation of important terrain features with the cartographic need for generalization at different scales, demonstrating a practical application of the concepts presented in the documentation."}, "83": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/590909", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/311678/"], "docs_id": 590909, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using **Ubuntu 12\\.04 LTS 64\\-bits OS** on my machine.\n\nPreviously I was using Windows on my machine.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation.

Inserting the narrative present into a narrative that is otherwise in past tense has to be handled *very* carefully with good transitions between. Usually, you want something to indicate that you are now going to tell *a story within a story* of sorts. And after you switch to the present tense, you want to stick with it for the entire story. For example:\n\n> I had the strangest experience with my mother the other day. We're walking down the street and she's holding my hand tighter than usual. I don't know why. An expensive car pulls up right next to us, and I look at it. My mother looks at me looking at it and slaps me.\n\nThe first sentence sets the stage for telling the story about your experience. Then the experience itself is related in present tense to give it a sense of immediacy. Some writers would insist that you shouldn't make a tense switch like this one, either, but in my opinion it can sometimes be an effective tool (when used sparingly). You might, especially, see it used to relate dreams within a story, for example.\n\nIn spoken language, however, people mix up tenses all the time, and I can easily imagine someone mixing their tenses in speaking the way you did in your mother story (although not the way you did in your bus one\u2014that one's too extreme even for speech). But it's not necessarily purposeful, it's just a question of mouth moving faster than brain\u2014and possibly of the person telling the story switching in and out of a personal sense of immediacy. For example, the person is possibly living in the memory of the story when saying \"she's been holding my hand tighter than usual\" and then coming back to the true present to reflect on it with \"I didn't know why she did that.\"\n\nThe reason the bus example feels too extreme is simply that it's just too short to support the tense change. There's isn't a separate subnarrative there. It's only two sentences, and each is in a different tense."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about tense usage in writing and speech, I'll create a question that requires analysis and application of these concepts:\n\nQuestion: A novice writer is working on a short story and wants to experiment with tense shifts for dramatic effect.

Option D is the most effective use of tense shifts according to the principles described:\n\n1. It starts with a past tense sentence that sets the context: \"Sarah always loved rainy days.\"\n2. It then shifts to present tense for a specific scene, giving it immediacy and vividness: \"She steps outside, feeling the cool drops on her skin.\"\n3. The present tense is maintained consistently throughout the scene, avoiding jarring shifts.\n4. The shift is used to create a sense of immediacy for a specific moment within a broader past-tense context, which aligns with the guideline of using tense shifts sparingly and purposefully.\n\nOptions A and C incorrectly mix tenses within very short passages without a clear purpose or transition, similar to the \"bus example\" criticized in the documentation. Option B attempts to use the technique described for relating a past experience in present tense, but the execution is flawed due to the inconsistent use of past tense (\"gripped\") within the present-tense narrative.

I then lift the stone up and uniformly select an unoccupied site to place it back down which satisfies the dual criterion of: (a) being at most a distance $d$ from both of the stone's nearest neighbors, and (b) not disturbing the initial ordering of the stones along the integer interval (note that the stone's original position can be reselected). If $d\\=1$, no stone can be moved from its original position and the center of mass of the stones/system, $C\\_m$, will be immobile. However, if $d\\=2$, starting from the state $(\\-2,\\-1,0,1,2\\)$, the center of mass will move to either the right or left with some per step probability of $\\\\frac{1}{k}$ (until we leave this initial system state).\n\nMy question is \\- provided some number of stones $k$, and some \"leashing distance\" $d$, how can we characterize the dynamics of the random walk taken by the above system's center of mass, $C\\_m$? What is the average step time and size, and, in terms of Euclidean distance, what mean square displacement can we expect after some number of steps, $T$?\n\nUpdate (due to a suggestion by Douglas Zare) \\- The $k$ stones must be kept in order, and the distance between a stone and its two nearest\\-neighbors along the interval (or one nearest\\-neighbor if the stone occupies the left\\-most or right\\-most position of the chain) can be at most $d$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a particular case of **random walks with internal degrees of freedom** (aka semi\\-Markov random walks or covering Markov chains). In the case when the translation group is just $\\\\mathbb Z$ (like in this question) this is a Markov chain on $\\\\mathbb Z \\\\times X$ with translation invariant transition probabilities. In the \"inchworm\" situation one can take for $X$ the (finite) set of all configurations in which the leftmost stone is at the point $0\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z$. Then states of the worm are described by the pairs $(n,\\\\phi)\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\times X$, where $n$ is the position of the leftmost stone, and $\\\\phi$ is the shifted configuration. The center of masses will then be within uniformly bounded distance from $n$. It is obvious that in these coordinates the transition probabilities of the chain describing worm's motion are translation invariant, so that this is a random walk with internal degrees of freedom on $\\\\mathbb Z$. \n\nThe paper \"Random walks with internal degrees of freedom. I. Local limit theorems\" of Kr\u00e1mli and Sz\u00e1sz (MR0699788\\) describes the asymptotic behaviour of such chains in terms of the properties of the quotient chain on $X$. In particular, there is an explicit formula for the non\\-zero variance of the displacement in terms of the stationary distribution on $X$ (which in our case should also be quite explicit \\- it's a nice exercise)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In the described stone-moving system with k stones and a leashing distance d, how would increasing d from 2 to 3 most likely affect the random walk of the system's center of mass (Cm) over a large number of steps?\n\nA) The mean square displacement would increase, but the average step size would remain constant\nB) Both the mean square displacement and average step size would increase proportionally\nC) The mean square displacement would increase, while the average step time between significant movements would decrease\nD) The system would exhibit more frequent but smaller steps, resulting in a similar overall mean square displacement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the given information:\n\n1. When d=2, the center of mass moves with a probability of 1/k per step, implying that many steps result in no movement.\n\n2. Increasing d allows for more possible positions for each stone, increasing the probability of movement on any given step. This reduces the average time between significant movements of the center of mass.\n\n3. With d=3, stones can be placed further apart, potentially leading to larger individual steps when outer stones are moved.\n\n4. The mean square displacement is a function of both step frequency and step size. With both of these likely to increase, the overall mean square displacement would increase more rapidly with a larger d.\n\n5. The system still maintains its ordered nature and the stones remain \"leashed,\" so the increase in movement is constrained.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the average step size would likely increase with a larger d. Option B oversimplifies the relationship between d and the system's behavior. Option D contradicts the expected behavior, as larger d should lead to less frequent \"no movement\" steps and potentially larger movements.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the complex system described, apply the concepts to a modified scenario, and predict the outcomes based on the interplay of multiple factors.

Your example falls into this category \\- it didn't *need* code, but the code is easier to read than the prose, and *together* they help to clarify the problem in a way that either one alone wouldn't.\n\n...and **then there are problems that don't benefit from code *at all*.** The asker is trying to do something specific, but has absolutely *no clue* how to do it \\- and any code he might include is just a waste of space:\n\n> How do I frob a widget? \n> \n> \n> I'm building a pugnacious flywheel grommet, and have found that I need to stabilize the system by frobnicating all incoming widgets.

It warns that adding reputation points for badges \"would likely encourage more negative behavior to precisely achieve the bonus.\"\n3. The example of users trying to game the system to get a taxonomist badge is mentioned.\n\nOption A is plausible but doesn't account for the potential negative consequences. Option B might seem logical, but the documentation doesn't support this conclusion. Option D is a positive outcome that the platform might hope for, but the evidence suggests the opposite is more likely.\n\nThe distractors represent common misconceptions about incentive systems, requiring critical thinking to evaluate.

The error message indicates a missing MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) decoder plugin for Firefox, suggesting that Firefox relies on system-level plugins for media playback. Chrome's ability to play the same radio stream implies it has built-in codec support.\n\nThe provided solution, which involves editing network interface configurations, is actually unrelated to the described problem and would not resolve the codec issue.

The physicist discovers that a function f(x) describing a property of the system is equivalent to another function g(t). They want to analyze the rate of change and acceleration of this property. Which of the following expressions correctly represents f''(x) in terms of g(t) and its derivatives?\n\nA) f''(x) = -1/(4x\u00b3/\u00b2) * g'(t) + 1/(4x) * g''(t)\nB) f''(x) = -1/(4x\u00b3/\u00b2) * g'(t) - 1/(4x) * g''(t)\nC) f''(x) = 1/(4x\u00b3/\u00b2) * g'(t) + 1/(4x) * g''(t)\nD) f''(x) = -1/(2x\u00b3/\u00b2) * g'(t) + 1/(2x) * g''(t)\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires the application of chain rule and understanding of second-order derivatives. The correct expression for f''(x) is derived as follows:\n\n1. Given: f(x) = g(t) and x = t\u00b2\n2. First, we find f'(x) using the chain rule:\n   f'(x) = (dt/dx) * g'(t) = 1/(2\u221ax) * g'(t)\n3. To find f''(x), we differentiate f'(x) again:\n   f''(x) = d/dx[1/(2\u221ax) * g'(t)]\n   = d/dx[1/(2x^(1/2))] * g'(t) + [1/(2\u221ax)]\u00b2 * g''(t)\n   = (-1/4) * x^(-3/2) * g'(t) + 1/(4x) * g''(t)\n   = -1/(4x\u00b3/\u00b2) * g'(t) + 1/(4x) * g''(t)\n\nThis matches option A.

You need to know yourself before you know your opponent. Think of battling yourself what you would do if you know you were on the surrounding and running away from a pudge. Blind hooking is an art because most players have been there done that. You will notice that your games are starting to look similar regardless of the roles. The main point of blind hooking is just knowing your range of the Q and where the opponent will be. To make a lock between point a(you) to b(opponent) you need to read him as if you are reading yourself in what you would do in this type of circumstance. So I will layout what you need to learn before you pull it off.\n\n1. Movement speed of each champion\n2. Animation time of your hook\n3. Your champion movement speed\n4. Knowing your opponents movements. Typically you should be able to recognize this cat and mouse game if you played long enough."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about blind hooks in MOBA games, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A professional Pudge player consistently lands blind hooks in high-stakes tournament matches.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the key points mentioned:\n\n1. Understanding opponent behavior: The documentation emphasizes \"knowing your opponents movements\" and \"reading him as if you are reading yourself.\"\n2. Game context: The answer includes \"game context,\" which relates to the documentation's point about how games often look similar and players can predict behavior based on common situations.\n3. Movement analysis: This aligns with the documentation's emphasis on understanding movement speeds and recognizing patterns in the \"cat and mouse game.\"\n\nOption A is a distractor that represents a simplistic view of blind hooking, ignoring the strategic elements described. Option B is unethical and not supported by the documentation. Option D focuses on only one aspect (hook mechanics) while ignoring the crucial elements of prediction and opponent analysis.\n\nThis question requires candidates to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario (tournament play), and demonstrate critical thinking about the complex skills involved in high-level gameplay.

Boom ! Black screen, fans and keyboards back lights increase activity for a few seconds and then the computer just turns off completely\n\n### Noticeable informations :\n\n* bluetooth can be on or off, it doesn't matter or affect the crash\nbehavior even if sometimes when I turn on the computer after a crash\nbluetooth can be activated or deactivated when it was in the opposite\nstate before the crash,\n* no crashes occur when connected to internet with both wifi and ethernet or just through the ethernet port only. The problem is only when the wifi is on.\n* no crashes when in the mac is started in safe mode and with only wifi on\n* the issue started after updating to sierra os x and prior that date I had very few crashes in years (almost none). Unfortunately my time machine copies before migrating to sierra have been overwritten with post sierra's copies\n\n### I have tried several solutions but the problem remains. Here is a list of the op\u00e9rations I went through so far with absolutely zero success :\n\n* Changing Mac OS X Wireless Card Country Code as explained [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9768/change-mac-os-x-wireless-card-country-code)\n* removing all wifi preferences and all extensions, LaunchAgents, LaunchDeamons, Internet pluggins, etc. (both in /Libbrary/, \\~/Library/, /System/Library, etc.)\n* removing all my applications that could mess up with the system (brew, ports, cleaner, magicPrefs, Citrix, antivirus, etc.) and cleaned all their remaining files (such as .plist files, etc.)\n* updating to os x sierra with the utilities of the recovery mode\n* bootable usb key, hard drive format, os x sierra clean installation and personal data recovery with time machine\n* and of course I have tried contacting the apple support (feedback/bug report messages, phone calls and several visits to the so called genius bar where all hardware tests showed nothing wrong (their conclusion : as it works fine in safe mode, it might be a software issue but they don't know where and why turning wifi on is triggering the crashes). My conviction : it is a faulty sierra wifi card driver responsible of the crashes as I always get com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360\\.0 crash logs after each single unwanted shutdown and few times accompanied with a com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family crash log (CCIOReporter log file).\n\nI think all is said about my issue. And I will also provide a crash report (pretty messy) or an etreCheck reports (clearer) but both didn't give usable information.

But if I don't shut it down or hibernate it works down to 0%\n\nI have no proofs but I think the problem is in the combination of soft wifi and battery status."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A MacBook Pro user is experiencing frequent system crashes when using Wi-Fi. The crashes do not occur in safe mode or when using Ethernet. Given the following information from the user's report, what is the most likely root cause of the issue?\n\nA) Faulty Wi-Fi hardware\nB) Incompatible third-party software\nC) Corrupted system files\nD) Driver conflict in macOS Sierra\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The issue is most likely caused by a driver conflict in macOS Sierra. Several key points support this conclusion:\n\n1. The problem started after updating to Sierra OS X, indicating a software-related issue rather than hardware failure.\n2. The system operates normally in safe mode, which suggests that the core hardware is functioning correctly.\n3. No crashes occur when using Ethernet, further pointing to a Wi-Fi-specific software problem.\n4. The user consistently gets \"com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360.0\" crash logs, indicating a problem with the Wi-Fi driver.\n5. Apple support suggested it might be a software issue, as hardware tests showed no problems.\n6. The issue persists even after a clean installation of the OS, ruling out user-installed software conflicts.\n\nThe combination of these factors strongly suggests a conflict between the macOS Sierra Wi-Fi driver and the system's hardware. This type of issue often arises when new operating systems are not fully optimized for older hardware configurations. The fact that the problem doesn't occur in safe mode further supports this, as safe mode uses basic drivers and minimal system extensions.\n\nOption A is unlikely because the hardware functions correctly in safe mode and with Ethernet. Option B is ruled out as the problem persists after a clean OS installation. Option C is less likely given the consistent nature of the crashes and their specific relation to Wi-Fi usage.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple pieces of information from the user's report, analysis of the symptoms, and application of troubleshooting principles, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "97": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/12", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/27910364", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4446860/"], "docs_id": 27910364, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to remove all buttons from panel. somehow it remove only half with my code. i do not know why. this is in c\\# windows form. can someone explain please. thank you. code as follows:\nAdded using\n\n```\n        for(int ii=1; ii<=6; ii++)\n        {\n            for(int jj=1; jj<=5; jj++)\n            {\n                Button b = new Button();\n                b.TabStop = false;\n                b.Width = 146;\n                b.Height = 91;\n                b.Click += new EventHandler(b_Click);\n                panel.Controls.Add(b);\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\nRemove using\n\n```\n        foreach (Control c in panel.Controls)\n        {\n            c.Click -= new EventHandler(this.b_Click);\n            panel.Controls.Remove(c);\n            c.Dispose();\n        }\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your list of controls is iterating to the half because the iterator increase while the amount of items are decrease.

After Disposing, the events are cleared and the button could not be used either.\u00b4\n\nIf you want a 1 line solution, you could only use Dispose.

After implementing the removal code, they notice only about half of the buttons are being removed. Which of the following best explains this behavior and provides the most efficient solution?\n\nA) The removal loop is modifying the collection it's iterating over, causing some buttons to be skipped. The solution is to use a reverse for loop to remove the buttons.\n\nB) The panel's Controls collection is thread-safe and automatically handles concurrent modifications. The issue is likely caused by a race condition, and the solution is to use a lock statement during removal.\n\nC) The foreach loop is iterating over a live collection while removing items, leading to index shifts. The correct approach is to create a separate list of buttons and iterate over that for removal.\n\nD) The Dispose method is not being called correctly, causing some buttons to remain in memory. The solution is to implement IDisposable interface on the custom Button class.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue arises because the foreach loop is iterating over the panel.Controls collection while simultaneously removing items from it. This causes the collection to be modified during iteration, leading to index shifts and some buttons being skipped.\n\nThe most efficient solution, as suggested in the top answer, is to create a separate list of buttons first and then iterate over that list for removal. This approach avoids the problems associated with modifying a collection during iteration.\n\nThe correct implementation would be:\n\n```csharp\nList<Button> buttons = panel.Controls.OfType<Button>().ToList();\nforeach (Button btn in buttons)\n{\n    panel.Controls.Remove(btn);\n    btn.Dispose();\n}\n```\n\nOr even more concisely:\n\n```csharp\npanel.Controls.OfType<Button>().ToList().ForEach(btn => btn.Dispose());\n```\n\nThis solution correctly addresses the root cause of the problem, uses LINQ for efficient filtering and conversion to a list, and properly disposes of the buttons, which automatically removes them from the panel and clears all associated events.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a reverse for loop could work, it's not the most efficient or clear solution. Option B is incorrect because the Controls collection is not thread-safe, and this isn't a threading issue. Option D is incorrect because the Button class already implements IDisposable, and the issue is not related to improper disposal."}, "98": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/12/28", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/44376", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/7652/"], "docs_id": 44376, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I stole only one single item so far in the game, and just because it was part of a mission.\n\nAfter buying myself nice house in Whiterun I placed some items for storage in couple of chests. After some time when I got back to grab something I noticed that one item in every chest is suddenly red, as if taking it will steal it! It appears to be random, in one chest it's Bonemeal and in the other iron ingot.\n\nI didn't steal them, from what I remember I picked the bonemeal from a skeleton and the ingot was placed somewhere and I took it \\- didn't steal it. (Crime stats prove this)\n\nWhat can be the reason, or is this a bug?\n\n**Edit**: The red items are always the same, and few months have passed (Skyrim time) already. It didn't happen in other storage I have (drawer in Jorrvaskr).\n\n**Actions I took to debug this:**\n\n1. Took one of the two Iron Ingots in the chest, the remaining ingot became white and my Stolen Items count did not go up.\n2. Took one of the four Bone Meals in the other chest, still red. Took anothr and the remaining two were not red anymore. Stolen items count did not increase as well.\n3. I dropped the Iron Ingot to the ground. The command was `Steal` and indeed, after taking it from ground my Stolen Items count increased by one though without any bounty even though it was right near a guard. Same with the Bone Meal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You may have had a hireling steal or loot the item. This doesn't count toward your own items stolen, but the item will still be marked as stolen.\n\nYou may have looted an item which was already stolen when you found it. (I'm not certain how this can happen.)\n\nYou may have pickpocketed the item. This counts toward your \"Items Pickpocketed\" counter but not \"Items Stolen\".\n\nNote: Picking up a stolen item in your own home won't increment your stolen items counter. I've tested this, but you may want to save first anyway. If the red in your inventory bothers you, bonemeal and ingots lose their Stolen status when crafted using Alchemy and Smithing respectively."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about a Skyrim gameplay issue, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A player in Skyrim notices that some items in their house chests are marked as stolen (red) despite not having stolen them. After conducting tests, including dropping and picking up the items, what is the most likely explanation for this behavior?\n\nA) The items were originally stolen by a follower or hireling without the player's knowledge\nB) A bug in the game is randomly marking items as stolen after they are stored in containers\nC) The player unknowingly looted these items from illegal sources during quests\nD) The game is incorrectly flagging crafting ingredients as stolen to encourage players to use them\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of game mechanics knowledge. The correct answer is A because it best explains the observed behavior while aligning with the top answer's first point. \n\nThe key factors supporting this conclusion are:\n1. The items were not originally stolen by the player (confirmed by crime stats).\n2. The stolen status persists across time and is consistent for specific items.\n3. Taking the items from the chest doesn't increase the player's stolen item count.\n4. Dropping and picking up the items does increase the stolen count.\n\nThis scenario suggests that a follower or hireling likely acquired these items illegally without the player's knowledge. When stored in the player's chest, they retain their stolen status. However, the game doesn't count them as stolen for the player until they're directly handled (dropped and picked up).\n\nOptions B and C are less likely because they don't explain why only specific items are affected or why the stolen status behaves differently in chests versus when dropped. Option D is a distractor that misinterprets the game's design intentions.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, apply critical thinking to a complex scenario, and understand nuanced game mechanics beyond surface-level gameplay."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/23", "source": ["https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/1807", "https://meta.serverfault.com", "https://meta.serverfault.com/users/79846/"], "docs_id": 1807, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm relatively new to serverfault/stackexchange, though not to systems administration. I've posted only a few answers here so far. In the last day, two of my posts were edited by other users.

If I don't like it, tough noogies.\n\nAs a matter of, well, I don't know, courtesy? I find it rather annoying to have someone come in behind me and *fix my lack of capitalization*. \n\nI've habitually written like this for longer than I can remember (and for the young'uns, that means at least thirty years now). It's a stylistic choice. *where necessary/appropriate*, I'll use proper capitalisation. In the relatively informal setting of the internet, and a gathering place where one's expertise is what matters, it seems a bit passive\\-aggressive to be editing another bloke's words for such a trivial reason.\n\nAnother post that was edited also fixed the caps, but in addition did some trimming of what I wrote to conform to what that author apparently thought was nicer wording or style \\- perhaps a touch less verbose than it initially was.
