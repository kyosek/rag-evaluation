The documentation explains that LED drivers, which are switching power supplies, can create a \"relaxation oscillator\" effect when receiving a trickle of power. This can happen if the switch has a light or remote-control circuit that allows a small current through, or if a dimmer is set very low but not completely off. In these cases, the LED driver repeatedly tries to charge up and turn on the LED, immediately runs out of power, and then repeats the process, causing the observed blinking effect. This is a characteristic of how LED drivers function rather than a sign of damage or imminent failure of the bulb itself."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/08/12", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/231820", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/134111/"], "docs_id": 231820, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K00jS.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K00jS.jpg)Tuff Shed has 2x4 rafters on 24 center. I was going to spray foam 3\\.5 inches of closed cell foam for r19 value but then read it would defeat the silver lined radiant barrier and that heat would transfer to the foam.\n\nSo would it be better to leave a gap at the barrier and install a 1/2 inch rigid foam insulating board 1 inch away from the barrier between the rafters and then spray 2 inches of foam onto the foam board?

This way air will flow from the soffit into the wall above the sill and up the roof to the peak and exit via the ridge vent. Then I will install 1/2 inch rigid foam 1 inch from the roof. I will drill 1 1/2 screws into it so the one inch sticking out will keep it one inch from the roof. Then I am going to tack 2x2 lumber on each rafter interior face extending them so that I still have 3 1/2 inches to spray my closed cell foam for r19\\.\n\nSo the barrier will have a one inch channel of air space for the hot air to escape.

In fact, it seems you are not very clear with the concept of energy density. \n\nEnergy density is the energy per unit volume. What is important for this question is to realise is that you can use the energy density as a function of $x$ as long as it agrees with the value the electric field would have inside the sphere, and then outside the sphere. \n\nClearly, as you have derived the E\\-field is varying directly as $x$ inside. If you apply Gauss' law for a region outside the sphere, you get that the electric field varies as $1/x^2$.\n\nThese fields are clearly different in their functional forms. So what you need to do while calculating the potential energy of the sphere is to add the contribution inside and outside the sphere. \n\ni.e. $ U\\_1 \\= \\\\int \\\\Omega\\_1 dV$ having the limits of $x\\=0$ to $x\\=R$ (inside the sphere)\n\nAnd $U\\_2 \\= \\\\int \\\\Omega\\_2 dV$ having the limits of $x\\=R$ to $x \\\\to \\\\infty$. \n\nThe required potential energy will be: $U\\=U\\_1 \\+U\\_2$.

(Actually it is enough to have this for $i\\=1$ and all coherent ideal sheaves.)\n\nI asked myself whether there is an extension of this theorem to (Artin/Deligne\\-Mumford) stacks.

For example, take a graded ring $A$ and consider $X \\= Spec A // \\\\mathbb{G}\\_m$ (where the $\\\\mathbb{G}\\_m$\\-action is induced by the grading). The category of quasi\\-coherent sheaves on $X$ is (by fpqc\\-descent) equivalent to that of graded $A$\\-modules and the global sections functor corresponds to taking the zeroth degree of such a graded module. This is clearly exact and thus all higher cohomology groups of all quasi\\-coherent sheaves vanish. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose that $\\\\mathcal X$ is an algebraic stack with finite inertia (for example, a separated Deligne\\-Mumford stack); then, by a well\\-known result of Keel and Mori, there exist a moduli space $\\\\pi \\\\colon \\\\mathcal X \\\\to M$. The stack $\\\\mathcal X$ is called *tame* when $\\\\mathrm R^i\\\\pi\\_\\* F \\= 0$ for every quasi\\-coherent sheaf $F$ on $\\\\mathcal X$ and every $i \\> 0$. From the definition it follows easily that tame stacks with affine moduli spaces have the property you require. In characteristic 0, an algebraic stack with finite diagonal is tame if and only if it is Deligne\\-Mumford.\n\nThere are several different characterizations of tame stacks; see the paper \"Tame stacks in positive characteristic\" by Dan Abramovich, Martin Olsson and myself. Using the results in that paper, it is not hard to show that a noetherian algebraic stack with finite inertia has the property you want if and only if it is tame with affine moduli space.\n\n\\[Edit:] here is a proof that if a noetherian algebraic stack $\\\\mathcal X$ with finite inertia has the property you want it is tame with affine moduli space. Let $\\\\mathcal X \\\\to M$ be the moduli space. Let $\\\\mathcal G$ be the residual gerbe over a closed point of $M$; then $\\\\mathcal G$ is closed in $\\\\mathcal X$, so the cohomology of each quasi\\-coherent sheaf on $\\\\mathcal G$ is trivial. The moduli space of $\\\\mathcal G$ is the spectrum of a field, so $\\\\mathcal G$ is tame. This implies that the automorphism group of an object of $\\\\mathcal G$ is linearly reductive. One of the results in the paper implies that an open neighborhood of $\\\\mathcal G$ in $\\\\mathcal X$ is tame. Since every non\\-empty closed subset of $M$ contains a closed point of $M$, this implies that these open neighborhoods cover $\\\\mathcal X$, so $\\\\mathcal X$ is tame."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a noetherian algebraic stack X with finite inertia.

The way it is shown that all numbers satisfying these inequalities do work is by exhibiting a very simple family of arrangements $\\\\mathbb B^c\\_{a,b}$ which are obtained as the union of a pencil of $a$ lines (all passing through the same point), a simple arrangement of $b$ lines (no three lines concurrent), such that $c$ of the intersection points of the simple arrangement lie on the first pencil.

Labeling them as \"1,2,3,...\" doesn't change that fact. \n\n**\"is it correct and does it make sense to calculate the Pearson Correlation\"**\n\nCorrect depends on what you're trying to do with your data (the context). \n\nThe correlation between the time vector and the time series doesn't really make sense, in terms of quantifying relationships between variables. This is because with time\\-series data we expect statistical dependencies that make it hard to interpret the sample correlation as an estimator of a population correlation. Another issue is that correlation is a possible indicator of causal mechanisms, which doesn't make sense in your example (not that correlation *proves* a causal relationship, it may suggest it depending on the context). \n\nThat doesn't mean that interpretation is *impossible*. The correlation coefficient indicates the strength of a linear fit between two variables, both statistically and geometrically. Ignoring the statistical distributions aspect, a large value of the correlation suggests that a line could be drawn through the scatterplot of the bivariate data. \n\nIf you have a large correlation value between time and a time series, it could indicate a linear (mean) trend in the data.

While it's not inherently wrong to treat months as numeric values (1, 2, 3, ...) for analysis, the use of Pearson correlation for time series data has limitations. The correlation coefficient can be calculated, but it may not be the most informative measure due to the potential presence of autocorrelation and other time-dependent patterns in the data. It doesn't necessarily indicate a causal relationship (ruling out B) and doesn't require a perfectly linear trend to be meaningful (ruling out D).

As far as I know the data being stored in memory (Either HARD Disk or RAM) is 0s and 1s. \n\nI am sure beyond 0s and 1s there are different ways data being stored in memory devices based on memory device types. \n\nPlease share your ideas about it . \n\nor\n\nWhere can I study about the how data stored in memory devices ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Digital data is generally stored as 1s and 0s at some level. That is only the view of one level in a large layered hierarchy. Below that you get into charges, phase change of material, mechanical dimples, voltages in active circuits, little regions of magnetic domains, and lots more ways people have come up with over the years to store bits (the 1s and 0s).\n\nAbove the bit layer there is a hierarchy eventually surfaced to applications as a file system by the operating system. There are several layers above the bits and below the file system, but these vary depending on the exact storage device and the file system.\n\nIn general, large storage devices like disks, will present their memory as \"sectors\" or \"blocks\" that are the minimum amount that can be written or erased at once. In flash drives there is a layer that does \"wear leveling\" that swaps around physical blocks to implement the logical blocks presented upwards. Flash blocks have a limited write and erase lifetimes, and this layer seeks to wear them out as evenly as possible. Magnetic disks don't have this issue, but do sometimes have a \"bad spot\" layer that avoids physically defective blocks from the logical blocks presented upwards. Blocks usually contain CRC checksums implemented by the hardware.\n\nThe file system usually deals with the logical blocks directly. It uses some as index to know what it stored in others. Some file systems log operations to aid in recovery. There are lots of strategies for knowing which blocks are used to store the content of which files, which blocks are empty, etc. File systems often add their own checksums to logical blocks or files and other structures.\n\nEventually the file system presents a collection of \"files\" to the operating system. The OS will usually define a few files for its own purposes, then present something a little different to applications. How much different depends on the OS and whether it is intended to deal with multiple possibly hostile processes and other concerns.\n\nEventually the application sees arbitrarily sized collections of data, called files, it can read and write without having to worry about sectors, blocks, or how individual bits are physically stored. Modern file systems tend to present files as named entities in a tree structure."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the physical storage of data and how it's presented to applications?\n\nA) Applications directly interact with the physical 1s and 0s stored on memory devices.\nB) File systems present data to applications as arbitrarily sized collections called files, abstracting away the underlying storage mechanisms.\nC) Operating systems always present data to applications in the form of sectors or blocks.\nD) The hierarchy of data storage is a simple two-layer system: physical bits and application-level files.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation describes a complex hierarchy of data storage and presentation. At the lowest level, data is indeed stored as 1s and 0s, but this is abstracted through multiple layers before reaching applications. File systems present data to applications as files, which are arbitrarily sized collections of data. This abstraction allows applications to work with data without needing to understand the underlying storage mechanisms, such as sectors, blocks, or physical bit storage methods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because applications do not directly interact with the physical 1s and 0s. There are multiple layers of abstraction between the physical storage and the application level.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while operating systems and file systems may work with sectors or blocks, they typically present data to applications as files, not in these lower-level formats.\n\nOption D is oversimplified. The hierarchy of data storage involves multiple layers, including physical storage, sectors/blocks, file system structures, and finally the file abstraction presented to applications."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/29", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/219061", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/125482/"], "docs_id": 219061, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I run **GRUB** Boot\\-loader with open SUSE 13\\.2\\. \n\nI set **timeout\\=0** at Boot\\-loader Options tab and Default Boot Section\\='Windows 7\\*\\*\\*'.\n\nFrom then on, I couldn't see the GRUB menu to select which OS I want to boot\n\nHow do I get the boot menu back?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Try holding down the `Shift` key just after `POST`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has configured a dual-boot system with openSUSE 13.2 and Windows 7, using GRUB as the bootloader.

I am going to list the ones that come to mind!\n\n1. You have selected a custom system font file that does not adhere to standards. **Solution**: revert to the default system font or find another without bugs.\n2. The font file is corrupt. This is not likely since you say it occurs from time to time. **Solution**: Replace it with an original fetched online. Rebuild font caches.\n3. There is a version conflict in the chain of libraries that are responsible for rendering your fonts. **Solution**: `sudo update; sudo upgrade; sudo reboot;` usually does the trick. Also if you have a lot of PPAs installed, I would disable them together with software installed from them temporarily to see if the problem goes away.\n4. One of the font rendering libraries has a bug. This could manifest itself as some glyphs not being rendered properly like in your screen\\-shot. **Solution**: Reinstall font rendering packages.\n5. The font rendering library's cache is corrupt. Font rendering is an expensive/slow operation and it is customary to use caches of rendered bitmaps that are dynamically managed at run\\-time to speed this up. Should the memory or disk\\-space required for this cache not have sufficient security privileges, run out space, become corrupted due to hardware faults then this would make font rendering look ugly. **Solution**: Rebuild font caches with this: `sudo fc-cache -srv; fc-cache -rv`\n6. Hardware accelerated font rendering will rely on both the GPU and its driver. The GPU driver may have a bug or you are having hardware problems with your GPU that manifest themselves as errors in font rendering. Typically GPUs will start malfunctioning \"a little\" when they are under stress, overheat or in some cases when they don't receive enough power from the PSU. **Solution**: make sure your system is not overheating. Make sure your PSU is scaled to handle your GPU. There are utilities that can help you stress\\-test your GPU to see if this produces your problem.\n7. Memory chips have faults that manifest as memory corruptions. If this is the case you may also experience instability. If a memory chip gets just one bit wrong every 4 days this can manifest itself as really hard to track errors. **Solution**: run memtest86 or similar memory testing tools to verify that your chips are fine.\n8. Individual applications may have bugs that manifest themselves like your screen\\-shot. Especially applications that are text and font intense such as web\\-browsers. I have seen this myself in Firefox. At one time all letters were exchanged for small filled boxes. **Solution**: restart app or system if it happens seldom. Update software version if it happens often.\n9. Firmware bugs is a reality, especially in low end hardware. Also bugs in firmware are often masked over in the WINDOWS drivers. For Linux users this means we get to keep the firmware bugs for free. **Solution**: If you got your computer for cheaps, or it is from a vendor not known for it's focus on stability/Linux support then maybe you should start saving for a new system.\n\nHope at least some of this was of use.

What is the rate of growth of $T(n)$ as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$? \n\n**Updated**: What I would really like to know is if we can not establish the rate of growth of $T(n)$, is there at least an upper bound of order $$T(n) \\= n^{o(n)}?$$\n\nOr let $\\\\tilde{T}(n)$ denote the number of *labelled* triangulated surfaces on $n$ vertices.

The growth appears to be exponential, but since we know from Tutte's result that t(n,0) for a sphere grows exponentially, and the torus is a more complex surface, it's reasonable to expect t(n,1) to also grow exponentially, but potentially at a different rate. Option C suggesting faster than exponential growth is likely too extreme given the data. Therefore, B is the most plausible answer, suggesting exponential growth but at a potentially different rate than for the sphere."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/23", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/70824", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30613/"], "docs_id": 70824, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a bit confused on the term \"covariate\".

You have provided a single command to the `find ... -exec` parameter of `echo \"{}\"`. Note that this is not `echo` and the directory found by `find`; it's a single command that includes a space in its name. The `find` command (quite reasonably) cannot execute a command called `echo \"./workspace/6875538616c6/raw/2850cd9cf25b/360\"`.\n\nRemove the single quotes around the `-exec` parameter and you may find you don't need any additional changes or workarounds:\n\n```\nfind . -name '360' -type d -exec echo \"{}\" \\;\n\n```\n\nSimilarly here you need to remove the quoting of the entire value passed to `-exec`. But in this case you still need to quote the storage arguments so the shell cannot interpret `&`, etc.\n\n```\nfind reallylongfolderstructure -name '360' -type d -exec curl 'http://user:token@ourdomain.net/jenkins/job/jobname/buildWithParameters?token=ourtoken&parameter={}' \\; \n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're using the `find` command to locate directories named '360' and want to execute a curl command for each found directory.

This allows the `find` command to correctly execute the curl command for each found directory.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it keeps single quotes around the entire `-exec` parameter, which causes the command to be interpreted as a single string including the curl command.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't quote the URL, which would cause the '&' to be interpreted by the shell as a command separator.\n\nOption D, while potentially functional, is not the solution described in the original documentation and introduces unnecessary complexity by using `xargs`."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/18", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/46811532", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2806316/"], "docs_id": 46811532, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm getting a JSON from a URL \\- **WooCommerce API**.\n\nThe Problem is I cannot parse / output them in the app.\n\nNo errors, but it's showing up no data \\- just the Labels.\n\nMainActivity.java:\n\n```\n    package at.copy_cat.app.rest;\n\nimport android.os.AsyncTask;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.support.v4.app.Fragment;\nimport android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity;\nimport android.util.Log;\nimport android.view.LayoutInflater;\nimport android.view.Menu;\nimport android.view.MenuItem;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\nimport org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter;\nimport org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        if (savedInstanceState == null) {\n            getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()\n                    .add(R.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment())\n                    .commit();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n        super.onStart();\n        new HttpRequestTask().execute();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {\n\n        // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.\n        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n        // Handle action bar item clicks here.

So in this case you don't need to create your own regular expression pattern, because the proper one is going to be [quite complex](http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html). You don't want to do this.\n\nAnd this is the reason, why you had this problem: even though \"test@test..com\" passess ngPattern validation (but it should *not*, this is *not valid* email address, and your regular expression is [not standard compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address)), it fails on type\\=\"email\" validation (Angular one). \n\nAngular has build\\-in email validation regular expression (this one [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/4ae4cc9d469f0327c6576d8bd8ac7f402ddffa2d/src/ng/directive/input.js#L27)) which you can make use of simply by using input `type=\"email\"`.

This is because:\n\n1. Custom regular expressions for email validation, like the one shown in option A, are often not fully compliant with email address standards and may allow invalid emails to pass.\n\n2. Angular has a built-in, more comprehensive email validation regex that is used when type=\"email\" is specified.\n\n3. Combining both custom ng-pattern and type=\"email\" (option B) can lead to conflicting validations and unexpected results.\n\n4. While third-party libraries (option D) might be useful in some cases, they are often unnecessary for basic email validation when Angular provides a sufficient built-in solution.\n\nBy using just type=\"email\", developers can leverage Angular's robust email validation without the need for complex custom regular expressions or external dependencies."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/04", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/233780", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/65774/"], "docs_id": 233780, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to [arXiv:1507\\.08553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08553), the superconformal index, defined by\n\n$$I(\\\\beta\\_j) \\= \\\\mbox{Tr}\\_{\\\\mathcal{H}}(\\-1\\)^F e^{\\-\\\\gamma\\\\{Q,Q^\\\\dagger\\\\}}e^{\\-\\\\sum\\_{j}\\\\beta\\_j t\\_j}$$\n\nis independent of the parameter $\\\\gamma$.\n\n(Here, $F$ is the fermion number, $Q$ is the supercharge, and $t\\_j$'s are generators of the Cartan subalgebra of the superconformal and flavor symmetry algebra that commute with Q).\n\nIs this a standard result?

Every event where one specifies two coordinates and one leaves free the two remaining ones has probability exactly 1/4 because this event involves only the joint distribution of two independent Bernoulli random variables. Write N for an unspecified 0 or 1\\.

This has a profound effect on testability.\n\n**Testing is easier**. You can use fake parts (i.e. \"mocks\", \"doubles\" and other testing\\-talk).

I am very familiar with .NET in general but have never had a project that required such a significant focus on international accessibility. \n\nThe projected is initially being done in English. What measures should I take at this point to make it easier to implement localization in the future? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are developing ASP.Net MVC application, are you? Other answers seem to be specific to desktop applications. Let me capture common things:\n\n**Locale detection**\n\nIt is quite important that your application detect user's locale correctly. In desktop application, CultureInfo.CurrentCulture holds preferred formatting locale (the one that should be used to format numbers, dates, currencies, etc.) whereas CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture holds preferred User Interface locale (the one that should be used to display localized messages). For web applications, you should set both cultures to auto (to automatically detect locale from AcceptLanguage header) unless you want to implement some fancy locale detection workflow (i.e. want to support changing language on demand).\n\n**Externalize strings**\n\nAll strings should come from resources, that is Resx files. In Winforms App it is easily achievable by setting form Localizable property to true. You would also need to manually (unfortunately) externalize strings that come from your models. It is also relatively simple. In Asp.Net you would need to externalize everything manually...\n\n**Layouts**\n\nYou definitely need to allow for string expansion. In Winforms world it is achievable via TableLayoutPanel which should be used to make sure that layout will adjust automatically to accommodate longer text. In web world, you are a bit out of luck. You might need to implement CSS Localization Mechanism \\- a way to modify (override) CSS definitions. This would allow Localization folks to modify style issues on demand. Make sure that each HTML element in rendered page has unique id \\- it will allow to target it precisely.\n\n**Culture specific issues**\n\nAvoid using graphics, colors and sounds that might be specific for western culture. If you really need it, please provide means of Localization. Avoid direction\\-sensitive graphics (as this would be a problem when you try to localize to say Arabic or Hebrew). Also, do not assume that whole world is using the same numbers (i.e. not true for Arabic).\n\n**ToString() and Parse()**\n\nBe sure to **always** pass CultureInfo when calling ToString() unless it is not supported. That way you are commenting your intents. For example: if you are using some number internally and for some reason need to convert it to string use: \n\n```\nint i = 42;\nvar s = i.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\n\n```\n\nFor numbers that are going to be displayed to user use:\n\n```\nvar s = i.ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture); // formatting culture used\n\n```\n\nThe same applies to Parse(), TryParse() and even ParseExact() \\- some nasty bugs could be introduced without proper use of CultureInfo. That is because some poor soul in Microsoft, full of good intentions decided that it is a good idea to treat CultureInfo.CurrentCulture as default one (it would be used if you don't pass anything) \\- after all when somebody is using ToString() he/she want to display it to user, right? Turn out it is not always the case \\- for example try to store your application version number in database and then convert it to instance of Version class. Good luck.\n\n**Dates and time zones**\n\nBe sure to **always** store and instantiate DateTime in UTC (use DateTime.UtcNow instead DateTime.Now). Convert it to local time in local format upon displaying:\n\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.UtcNow;\nvar s = now.ToLocalTime().ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);\n\n```\n\nIf you need to send emails with time reference in body, be sure to include time zone information \\- include both UTC offset and list of cities:\n\n```\nDateTime someDate; // i.e. from database\nvar formattedDate = String.Format(\"{0} {1}\", \n             someDate.ToLocaleTime().ToString(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture),\n             TimeZoneInfo.Local.DisplayName);\n\n```\n\n**Compound messages**\n\nYou already have been warned not to concatenate strings. Instead you would probably use String.Format() as shown above. However, I must state that you should minimize use of compound messages. That is just because target grammar rules are quite commonly different, so translators might need not only to re\\-order the sentence (this would be resolved by using placeholders and String.Format()), but translate the whole sentence in different way based on what will be substituted. Let me give you some examples:\n\n```\n// Multiple plural forms\nEnglish: 4 viruses found.\nPolish: Znaleziono 4 wirusy. **OR** Znaleziono 5 wirus\u00f3w.\n\n// Conjugation\nEnglish: Program encountered incorrect character | Application encountered incorrect character.\nPolish: Program napotka\u0142 nieznan\u0105 liter\u0119 | Aplikacja napotka\u0142a nieznan\u0105 liter\u0119.\n\n```\n\n**Other concatenation issues**\n\nConcatenation is not restricted to strings. Avoid laying out controls together, say:\n\nRemind me again in \\[text box with number] days.\n\nThis should be re\\-designed to something like: Remind me again in this number of days: \\[text box].\n\n**Character encoding and fonts**\n\nAlways save, transfer, whatever text in Unicode (i.e. in UTF\\-8\\). Do not hard\\-code fonts \\- Localization might need to modify them and it will turn off default font fall\\-back mechanism (in case of Winforms).\nRemember to allow \"strange\" characters in most fields (i.e. user name).\n\n**Test**\n\nYou will probably need to implement so called pseudo translation, that is create resources for say German culture and copy your English strings adding prefix and suffix. You may also wrap placeholders to easily detect compound strings. The purpose of pseudo translation is to detect Localizability issues like hard\\-coded strings, layout issues and excessive use of compound messages."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When developing a .NET MVC application that will require international localization in the future, which of the following is NOT a recommended practice for preparing the application for localization?\n\nA) Externalize all strings into resource (Resx) files\nB) Always use DateTime.Now instead of DateTime.UtcNow for consistency\nC) Implement a pseudo-translation mechanism for testing localizability\nD) Avoid using direction-sensitive graphics in the user interface\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct because externalizing strings into resource files is a key practice for localization, allowing easy translation of text.\n\nB is incorrect and not recommended.

We do this by *calling* each function on that element:\n\n```\nfilters :: [a] -> [a -> Bool] -> [a]\nfilters xs fs = filter (\\x -> all ($ x) fs) xs\n```\n\nwe can further generalize the signature to:\n\n```\nfilters :: Foldable f => [a] -> f (a -> Bool) -> [a]\nfilters xs fs = filter (\\x -> all ($ x) fs) xs\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the given VBA code and problem description, which of the following approaches would be most effective for copying specific columns from multiple sheets in one Excel workbook to another, while allowing for dynamic pasting below existing data?\n\nA) Use the current code as is, but add a loop to iterate through all selected columns and sheets.\n\nB) Implement a Range.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell) method to find the last used cell in each column before pasting.\n\nC) Instead of copying entire columns, use a Range object to select only the used range in each column, then copy and paste that range.\n\nD) Replace the column copying approach with reading values into arrays, then writing the arrays to the destination workbook using Range.Value property.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A would not solve the main issues of copying entire columns and the inability to paste dynamically.\n\nOption B might help find the last used cell, but it doesn't address the core problem of copying entire columns.\n\nOption C is closer to a solution, but it still involves Copy/Paste operations which can be slow for large datasets and doesn't easily allow for dynamic placement in the destination.\n\nOption D is the most effective approach because:\n1.

I am looking for similar functionality for QEMU.\n\nThe documentation suggests to expose a Samba server running somewhere in the network, or use the `-net user,smb=/path/to/folder` to start a samba server.\n\nI had no luck with the `-net user,smb` option of QEMU. All it does is starting `smbd` (which conflicts with another service running locally due to a port conflict). Suffice to say, this is unusable, especially with multiple guests in mind. (For Linux, `-virtfs` (Plan 9\\) can be used for easy folder sharing.)\n\nOther problems with Samba is that it is not limited to folder sharing, it also does printer sharing, user mapping and whatsnot. All I need is to share one (or more?) folders with the Windows guest.\n\nDoes there exist an alternative folder sharing method for QEMU that works with a Windows guest?\n\nOr is there a way to configure Samba to restrict itself to a very limited set of features and integrate it into QEMU? It should:\n\n* Not everyone in the network should be able to access the folder.\n* local users included (if feasible).\n* Not provide other functionality (printer sharing).\n* Use case: expose a git directory to Windows, compile it in Windows and use Linux for analysis.\n* Have an acceptable speed, Windows uses virtio\\-scsi and virtio\\-net.\n* Be able to share a folder from a Linux host with a Windows 7 guest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: QEMU's built\\-in Samba service\n==============================\n\nThe not\\-functioning `-net user,smb` option was caused by an incompatibility with newer Samba versions (\\>\\= 4\\). This is fixed in QEMU v2\\.2\\.0 and newer with these changes:\n\n* [b87b8a8 slirp/smb: Move ncalrpc directory to tmp](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b87b8a8) (since v2\\.1\\.0\\)\n* [44d8d2b net/slirp: specify logbase for smbd](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=44d8d2b) (since v2\\.2\\.0\\)\n* [7912d04 slirp/smbd: modify/set several parameters in generated smbd.conf](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=7912d04) (since v2\\.2\\.0, disables printer too)\n\n(Debian has backported the latter two patches to 2\\.1\\+dfsg\\-6 which is present in Jessie.)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou can export one folder as `\\\\10.0.2.4\\qemu` when using User networking:\n\n```\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -net user,smb=/absolute/path/to/folder \\\n    -net nic,model=virtio \\\n    ...\n\n```\n\nWhen QEMU is successfully started with these options, a new `/tmp/qemu-smb.*-*/` directory will be created containing a `smb.conf`. If you are fast enough, then this file could be modified to make paths read\\-only or export more folders.\n\nMode of operation\n-----------------\n\nThe samba daemon is executed whenever ports 139 or 445 get accessed over a \"user\" network. Communication happens via standard input/output/error of the smbd process. This is the reason why newer daemons failed, it would write its error message to the pipe instead of protocol messages.\n\nDue to this method of operation, the daemon will not listen on host ports, and therefore will only be accessible to the guest. So other clients in the network and even local users cannot gain access to folders using this daemon.\n\nSince QEMU v2\\.2\\.0 printer sharing is completely disabled through the samba configuration, so another worry is gone here.\n\nThe speed depends on the network adapter, so it is recommended to use the [virtio `netkvm` driver](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/Download_Drivers) under Windows.\n\nAlso note that the daemon is executed by its absolute path (typically `/usr/sbin/smbd`) as specified at compile time (using the `--smbd` option). Whenever you need to try a new binary or interpose `smbd`, you will need to modify the file at that path.\n\nOther caveats\n-------------\n\nExecutables (`*.exe`) must be executable on the host (`chmod +x FILE`) for the guest to have execute permissions. To allow execution of any file, add the `acl allow execute always = True` option to a share.\n\nExample **read\\-only** smb.conf configuration which allows execution of any file (based on QEMU v2\\.2\\.0\\):\n\n```\n\n...\n[qemu]\npath=/home/peter/windows\nread only=yes\nguest ok=true\nforce user=peter\nacl allow execute always = True\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about QEMU's built-in Samba service for sharing folders with Windows guests is NOT correct?\n\nA) The `-net user,smb` option in QEMU versions prior to 2.2.0 had compatibility issues with Samba versions 4 and above.\n\nB) The Samba daemon executed by QEMU is accessible to all clients on the network, including local users on the host machine.\n\nC) To enable folder sharing, you can use the command line option `-net user,smb=/absolute/path/to/folder` when starting QEMU.\n\nD) QEMU's built-in Samba service disables printer sharing by default since version 2.2.0.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA is correct: The documentation states that the `-net user,smb` option had compatibility issues with Samba versions 4 and above before QEMU 2.2.0.\n\nB is incorrect: The documentation explicitly states that \"Due to this method of operation, the daemon will not listen on host ports, and therefore will only be accessible to the guest.

Unfortunately, the answer is pretty negative.\n\nThe following problem, which is one of the possible formulations of the question, is NP\\-complete.\n\n*Given*: N\u2208\u2115, finitely many linear constraints (equations or inequalities) over \u211a on variables aij and bij (1\u2264i,j\u2264N), and N\u00d7N rational matrices A and B satisfying AB\\=I and all the given linear constraints.  \n\n*Question*: Is there another pair (A, B) of N\u00d7N rational matrices that satisfy AB\\=I and all the given linear constraints?\n\nA proof is by reduction from the following problem (called \u201cAnother Solution Problem (ASP) of SAT\u201d):\n\n*Given*: An instance \u03c6 of [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) and a satisfying assignment to \u03c6.  \n\n*Question*: Is there another satisfying assignment to \u03c6?\n\nThe ASP of SAT is known to be NP\\-complete \\[YS03].\n\n*Note: The following reduction is much simplified compared to the first version posted. See below for the first version, which proves a slightly stronger result.*\n\nWe can construct a reduction from the ASP of SAT to the problem in question as follows. Given an instance of SAT with n variables x1,\u2026,xn, let N\\=n and constrain A to be a diagonal matrix such that A\\=A\u22121; these are easily written as linear equality constraints on the elements of A and A\u22121. These constraints are equivalent to the condition that A is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are \u00b11\\. Now encode a truth assignment to the n variables by such a matrix by letting aii\\=1 if xi is true and aii\\=\u22121 otherwise. Now it is easy to write down the constraints in SAT as linear inequalities.\n\nWith this encoding, the solutions to the given instance of SAT correspond one\\-to\\-one to the pairs (A, A\u22121) satisfying all the linear constraints. This establishes a reduction from the ASP of SAT to the problem in question, and therefore the problem in question is NP\\-complete.\n\n*Remark*. This reduction can be viewed as an ASP reduction from SAT to the problem of finding a pair (A, B) of matrices satisfying given linear constraints. For more about ASP reductions, see \\[UN96] and/or \\[YS03]. (The notion of ASP reductions was used in \\[UN96], where the authors treated it as a parsimonious reduction with a certain additional property. The term \u201cASP reduction\u201d was introduced in \\[YS03].)\n\n---\n\nIn fact, the problem remains NP\\-complete even if we allow only linear constraints on the variables aij and linear constraints on the variables bij (but not a linear constraint which uses both aij and bkl). The NP\\-completeness of this restricted problem can also be shown by reduction from the ASP of SAT.\n\nThe following lemma is a key to construct this version of a reduction.\n\n**Lemma**. Let A be a real symmetric invertible matrix. Both A and A\u22121 are stochastic if and only if A is the permutation matrix of a permutation whose order is at most 2\\.\n\nI guess that this lemma can be proved more elegantly, but anyway the following proof should be at least correct.\n\n**Proof**. The \u201cif\u201d part is straightforward. To prove the \u201conly if\u201d part, assume that both A and A\u22121 are stochastic. Note the following properties of A:\n\n* Because A is symmetric, A can be diagonalizable and all eigenvalues are real.\n* Because A is stochastic, all eigenvalues have modulus at most 1\\.\n* Because A\u22121 is stochastic, all eigenvalues have modulus at least 1\\.\n\nTherefore, A can be diagonalizable and all eigenvalues are \u00b11, and therefore A is an orthogonal matrix. Since both the 1\\-norm and the 2\\-norm of each row are equal to 1, all but one entry in each row are 0\\. Therefore, A is a permutation matrix, and the only symmetric permutation matrices are the permutation matrices of some permutations whose order is at most 2\\. (end of proof of Lemma 1\\)\n\nIt is easy to write down linear constraints which enforce A to be symmetric and both A and A\u22121 to be stochastic. In addition, write down linear constraints which enforce A to be block diagonal with 2\u00d72 blocks. Given an instance of SAT with n variables x1,\u2026,xn, we encode a truth assignment by a 2n\u00d72n matrix which is block diagonal with 2\u00d72 blocks so that the first block is $\\\\pmatrix{1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1}$ if x1 is true and the first block is $\\\\pmatrix{0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0}$ if x1 is false and so on.\n\nNow that a truth assignment can be encoded as a matrix, the rest is the same: just verify that it is easy to write down the constraints in SAT as linear inequalities and that there is one\\-to\\-one correspondence between the solutions to a SAT instance and the pairs (A, A\u22121) of matrices satisfying the linear constraints.\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\n\\[UN96] Nobuhisa Ueda and Tadaaki Nagao.
