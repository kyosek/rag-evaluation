We write exclusively in C\\#.\n\nThe company is a fairly small one, with about 50 staff; three of whom are actual developers. Management (even IT management) do not have any IT background or experience other than project management of IT projects (and therefore some passing knowledge of terminology and business impacts).\n\nThe applications are chiefly online services to support the products sold by the company. The company doesn't sell any software directly.\n\nSo to phrase this whole situation in a reasonably specific and answerable question: \nWhat are some compelling reasons for and against trying to pull all your systems together into one over\\-arching solution given the current conditions (i.e. old code base, complex business systems and rules)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bad idea\n--------\n\nThis reaction is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. There are a lot of fairly disparate applications being homogenised\n2. There are many teams working on the different applications\n3. There is no well\\-respected and authoritative software architect actively managing the applications\n\n**What will happen if you go ahead**\n\nMost likely there will be an inital consolidated effort to bring everything together under a single design approach. This will show up the huge effort required to make everything work the same and may get canned as being unworkable. \n\nIf it presses on then some kind of centralised repository containing configuration data (e.g. security access, logging levels etc) will be required at which point someone will point out the obvious and say \n\n> \"Hey, why don't we just retrofit this\n>  externalised configuration approach to\n>  the old applications, it'll be much quicker?\"\n\nand a moment later someone else will pipe up with\n\n> \"And, since we're refactoring anyway,\n>  why don't we just apply a design\n>  standard for each of the application domains \\- web\n>  processing looks like this, business rule\n>  processing like this and database\n>  access like, er this.\"\n\nuntil finally\n\n> \"Oh, and there's a lot of common code here why not put together some\n>  easily shared libraries.

The current environment consists of three ASP.Net 1.1 sites and one MVC2 application, all with complex and unique business rules. Given this scenario, which of the following approaches is most likely to yield positive results?\n\nA) Proceed with full consolidation into a single, monolithic codebase to homogenize permissions, design, and functionality.\n\nB) Maintain separate applications but implement a centralized repository for configuration data, such as security access and logging levels.\n\nC) Abandon the consolidation idea entirely and continue maintaining separate codebases as they are.\n\nD) Create a new, separate application that incorporates features from all existing applications, running it in parallel with legacy systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most balanced and practical approach given the scenario. Full consolidation (A) is likely to be overly complex and risky given the disparate nature of the existing applications and limited development resources. Abandoning the idea entirely (C) misses an opportunity for improvement. Creating a new parallel application (D) would strain the limited development resources without addressing the issues in existing systems.\n\nOption B allows for gradual improvement by centralizing common elements like configuration data, while avoiding the pitfalls of a full consolidation.

(3\\) To obtaining such large angle using lens will cause severe [dispersion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_%28optics%29), that is the color of each pixel now spreading out and might overlap with other pixel. (4\\) The image at the edges would be distorted by most lens.\n\nThe brightness is usually adjustable, but not the angular resolution. But your aim seems to be have a larger image in a screen so it is not a problem whatever scheme you are using. So the (3\\) and (4\\) are the problems caused by using lens.\n\nIf you want a large image, my suggestion is to simply move your projector further away from the screen.

This solution addresses the problem described in the documentation where external CSS is injected into the <body> and overrides internal CSS in the <head>. By using @import at the top of the CSS section, external stylesheets can be loaded first, allowing custom CSS rules written afterwards to take precedence.

It means essentially connect to the assigned IP address for the server. You can use the actual IP address instead, but I find this easier: you don't have to remember or lookup up the server's IP.\n\n**FWIW:** This also works brilliantly for browser testing when you have a VM setup for bridged networking. The VM gets its own IP on the LAN with bridged networking.

However, they are both useful.\n\nIf the base is being substantially current fed, so from a high impedance, then the \u03b2 model is most useful. If we are substantially controlling the base voltage, so driving it with a low impedance, then the diode equation can be easier to use.\n\nWhen we design transistor amplifiers, we need to be able to tolerate the large changes in temperature and \u03b2 that would otherwise upset the bias conditions, so these approximations are quite good enough to tell us whether we have a workable design. Any precision work needs feedback, and that's a different set of equations.\n\nWhen I design a transistor amplifier, I tend to choose the working collector current of each stage, then work backwards with the \u03b2 formula to what base current (to what **range** of base currents) that would require, and then see how much voltage drop is caused in my proposed biassing network or feedback divider by that current. If it's too high, or too variable, then I can reduce the bias impedances, or choose a higher \u03b2 transistor configuration, or otherwise iterate the design to tolerate the range.\n\nI don't find a need to use the base voltage formula.

Unlike normal combustion processes that require specific conditions (heat, fuel, and oxygen), ClF3 is so reactive that it can initiate and sustain combustion without these typical prerequisites. In contrast, the coal quality determination process involves heating coal in a controlled environment, likely with limited oxygen, to release volatile compounds without full combustion of the coal itself. The extreme reactivity of ClF3 would overcome any protective factors or environmental controls present in standard coal testing procedures, causing immediate and vigorous combustion."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2023/01/06", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/437974", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/4556/"], "docs_id": 437974, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Added:** As remarked in the answers below, my question has a negative (and well\\-known) answer.\n\nWe denote by $\\\\mathcal P\\=\\\\lbrace 2,3,5,7,\\\\ldots\\\\rbrace$ the set of prime\\-numbers and by\n$\\\\mathcal P^\\*\\=\\\\lbrace 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,1,13,16,\\\\ldots\\\\rbrace$ the set of non\\-trivial prime\\-powers.

A [previous question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252914/how-to-get-the-hot-questions-by-some-query) asks how to get information on this via the data explorer, and it seems this is not possible.\n\nSo, I have a feature request: **please make the Hot Network Questions list auditable from within the Stack Exchange Data Explorer**.\n\nWhat I have in mind is a new table which contains:\n\n* the question id\n* the date and time the question got on the list\n* the date and time the question got off the list\n* if feasible, the number of views driven to the question via the sidebar\n* if feasible, the per\\-site breakdown of those referrals\n\t+ if that's not feasible, maybe a breakdown per category as separated on [the main SE list](https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentanswered), or just\n\t+ a per\\-site breakdown only for sites within the same category as the hosting site\n\nA table like this would go a long way to help understand the effects of the sidebar. For example, it would enable queries to dig out\n\n* HNQs that were closed after their time on the spotlight, or\n* that were heavily downvoted, possibly\n* preferentially by users with 200\\+ rep on the host site.\n\nThese give a better idea of what sorts of questions cause tensions within the site, which can help suggest ways to minimize those tensions, as well as provide a more accurate picture of the extent to which it is a problem.\n\nA table like this would also provide of information on how the sidebar *can* help a site, including\n\n* users whose first answer is on a HNQ that go on to become established users, and the questions that capture them\n* good answers (as e.g. with a high score accumulated after the spotlight goes away) posted during the spotlight period, and the questions that sparked them.\n\nA lot of the good that the HNQ does to a site is much harder to measure (as it is mostly in the form of traffic, what it does after landing, and whether those users return later or not) but a simple table like this provides a fair amount of insight.\n\nI am aware that any addition to the SEDE needs to be thought about carefully, and there is always a development cost, but this one looks rather simple to me. It rides on logging that is (hopefully) already done, and which otherwise should pose a very small performance hit, and the rest of the processing can be done offline. The table itself should be pretty light (particularly if it only contains on and off dates), and it represents a small subset of questions to begin with.

In theory, one could extract it from the raw request logs but in practice that's a massive headache for more than a few days at a time. \n\nAnd we're already talking about quite a bit of data. Figure that the hot list is refreshed every 3 minutes, and contains 100 entries (neither of those are probably quite right, but close enough for a napkin estimate). That's 48 thousand rows every day, pretty close to the number of PostHistory entries created per day on Stack Overflow. \n\nOf course, that's across all sites. It wouldn't really make much sense to put these in an individual site's database, since you'd want the full list to interpret them. So we'd have to put it somewhere else. Internally, there's a Sites database that holds on to stuff that isn't attached to a specific site, but exposing that in SEDE would be a bit odd. In any case, you'd have to be doing cross\\-database joins to get any of the information you're after, unless we denormalized it (as we do internally for *generating* the hot list)... But of course, that would increase the size of the data being stored as well.\n\nFinally, some of what you're after cannot be exposed in public data *ever*: revealing the reputation of voters.\n\nIn any case, this is a lot less trivial than it sounds. And that's not even getting into the secondary issues of which \"hot\" posts are actually *displayed* \\- the sidebar lists pick a random sample, and *those are cached too*.

The answer explains that implementing an auditable HNQ list is not trivial due to several factors:\n\n1. The data volume would be significant, with an estimated 48,000 rows per day.\n2. The cross-site nature of the HNQ list makes it difficult to store and query the data efficiently within the current SEDE structure.\n3. Some desired information, such as voter reputation, cannot be exposed due to privacy concerns.\n4. Additional complexities arise from caching, random sampling in the sidebar, and other traffic sources like social media shares.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the implementation is described as far from simple and would require careful consideration of resources.\n\nOption B is explicitly stated as not feasible due to the \"insane amount of data\" it would generate.\n\nOption C is partially correct about the data volume, but it doesn't capture the full scope of challenges mentioned in the answer."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/01/01", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/95630", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/24921/"], "docs_id": 95630, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to change contact us page layout from current 2columns\\-rightlayout to 1column layout, i have no idea how to do that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: there is two method to do that\n\n**Method 1**\n\n```\napp/design/frontend/base/default/layout/contacts.xml\n\n```\n\ncopy to your theme \n\n```\napp/design/frontend/yourpackage/yourtheme/layout/contacts.xml\n\n```\n\nchange \n\n```\n<action method=\"setTemplate\"><template>page/2columns-right.phtml</template></action>\n\n```\n\nto \n\n```\n<action method=\"setTemplate\"><template>page/1column.phtml</template></action>\n\n```\n\n**Method 2**\n\n```\napp/design/frontend/yourpackage/yourtheme/layout/local.xml\n\n```\n\nif there add below or else create new `local.xml`\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n    <layout version=\"0.1.0\">\n        <contacts_index_index>\n            <reference name=\"root\">\n            <action method=\"setTemplate\"><template>page/1column.phtml</template></action>\n        </reference>\n        </contacts_index_index>\n    </layout>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working on a Magento e-commerce site and need to change the layout of the contact us page from a 2-column right layout to a 1-column layout.

It is rejecting further requests.\n\nMaybe you're being DDoS, maybe the application is very slow or blocked, maybe there are too many users and too little hardware resources for the application. Can't tell which case this is without further information.\n\nLook into this. I don't know what WSGI tools you are using to give you the exact settings for your environment.\n\n**Increase the number of workers/processes**. Each worker can process one request at a time. Multiple workers will be able to process multiple requests in parallel, usually 1 worker per core.\n\n**Increase the listening queue to 500**. A moderate amount of users could generate bursts of a hundred requests at times. It takes a bigger queue to handle that amount of traffic, assuming there is enough resources to process these requests shortly.\n\n**Check your application**. Make sure it's working and efficient. There are a hundred requests pending, is this normal? The application might be slow, hanging or lacking resources."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web application is experiencing issues with request handling. The server is rejecting requests after processing 100 concurrent requests.

Increasing the number of workers/processes allows for more parallel request processing, typically one worker per CPU core. This helps handle concurrent requests more efficiently.\n\n2. Increasing the listening queue to 500 accommodates potential bursts of requests, preventing immediate rejection when the current 100-request limit is reached.\n\n3. Investigating application efficiency is crucial as the high number of pending requests might indicate underlying issues with the application's performance or resource utilization.\n\nOption A incorrectly suggests decreasing the listening queue, which would exacerbate the problem. Option B proposes decreasing workers/processes, which would reduce parallel processing capability. Option D maintains the current setup without addressing the core issues and focuses solely on hardware, which may not be the root cause of the problem."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/01/02", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/420003", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/196338/"], "docs_id": 420003, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using `QThread` to run processingBar and heavy job so the user will know it's loading.\nEverything works fine until the job is done then the map is stuck and not reloading.\nIt looks like I need to reload Qgis somehow so the map that i use will work well after the thread is done\n\nThis is what I tried:\n\n```\ndef onStart(self):\n    self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 0)\n    self.myLongTask.start()\n\ndef onFinished(self):\n    self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 1)\n\ndef run(self):\n        self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 1)\n        self.dlg.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.onStart)\n        self.myLongTask = workThread()\n        self.myLongTask.taskFinished.connect(self.onFinished)\n\nclass workThread(QtCore.QThread):\n   taskFinished = QtCore.pyqtSignal()\n    def run(self):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        self.taskFinished.emit()\n\n```\n\nUpdate:\nI try using QObject as showed here:[https://realpython.com/python\\-pyqt\\-qthread/](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-qthread/)\n\nThis is how my run look like:\n\n```\n        self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 1)\n\n        self.thread=QThread()\n        self.indexThread=IndexThread()\n        self.indexThread.moveToThread(self.thread)\n        self.thread.started.connect(self.indexThread.run)\n        self.indexThread.taskFinished.connect(self.thread.quit)\n        self.indexThread.taskFinished.connect(self.indexThread.deleteLater)\n        self.indexThread.taskFinished.connect(self.onFinished)\n\n        self.thread.finished.connect(self.thread.deleteLater)\n\n        self.dlg.indexButton.clicked.connect(self.onStart)\n\n```\n\nOn start:\n\n```\ndef onStart(self):\n    print(\"test\")\n    self.thread.start()\n    self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 0)\n\n```\n\nOn finished:\n\n```\ndef onFinished(self):\n    print(\"finishing\")\n    self.dlg.progressBar.setRange(0, 1)\n\n```\n\nand I get the same result.

Participation is completely voluntary.\n\n> **The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it [here](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3083/2017-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire).**\n\nHere's how it'll work:\n\n* Until the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, June 26th at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 PM EST on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post *one question per answer*.\n* We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.\n* If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of `[text](link)`, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.\n* This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.\n* At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select **up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community** provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.\n* Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.\n* This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q\\&A.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a set of general questions, gathered as very common questions asked every election. As mentioned in the instructions, the first two questions are guaranteed to show up in the Q\\&A, while the others are if there aren't enough questions (or, if you like one enough, you may split it off as a separate answer for review within the community's 8\\). \n\n* How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?\n* How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?\n\n---\n\n* In your opinion, what do moderators do?\n* A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?\n* In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A new moderator for Ask Different is reviewing flags on a user who consistently provides valuable answers but generates many arguments in comments.

The documentation emphasizes the importance of dealing with users who provide valuable contributions but cause issues in other areas. A private, constructive conversation allows the moderator to address the problem while acknowledging the user's positive contributions. This aligns with the moderation philosophy of guiding users towards better behavior rather than taking punitive action immediately.\n\nOption A is too harsh for a first response, especially given the user's valuable contributions.

I want to repair my laptop's graphics card (ATI Mobility Radeon x300\\). I have done a visual inspection of the board and I couldn't find any damaged parts on it. I think it might be a capacitor problem. I tried using a digital multimeter to find damaged components but did not find any.\nWhenever I take my damaged computer parts to the repair shop, the repair guy easily finds the faulty part with the same multimeter that I have and repairs it in less than 15 minutes but they charge a large fee so I am trying to do it by myself. I am new to SMDs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Detecting ceramic SMD capacitors with a multimeter is going to be very difficult, basically impossible in a practical sense. Forgettaboutit.\n\nCapacitors look like opens at DC, which is what multimeters measure. You can try inspecting every one with a jeweler's loupe and looking for cracks in the caps and their solder joints, but the chances of seeing even a truly cracked cap are small.\n\nCeramic caps aren't the likely suspects when the board fails. Electrolytic caps are much more likely to fail, and some of the failure modes are visually obvious. You say you only have SMD caps and later say they are not electrolytic, but I am not convinced you understand that SMD and electrolytic are orthogonal and how to spot a SMD electrolytic. Look for anything that is roughly cylindrical and check if the top is really flat. As tcrosley said, the larger electrolytic caps have scoring in the metal at the top so that they fail in a controlled way if they rupture, and are less likely to take other parts with them. Replace anything that looks bulged, it doesn't need to be outright ruptured.\n\nStill, the chance of finding a fault on something as complicated with sophisticated construction as a modern graphics card by using a meter and visual inspection is slim. Unless you value your time at pennies/hour, you'd be better off just getting a new graphics card."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to diagnose issues with SMD capacitors on a graphics card, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) A digital multimeter is an effective tool for identifying faulty SMD ceramic capacitors.\nB) Visual inspection with a jeweler's loupe is the most reliable method to detect cracks in SMD capacitors.\nC) SMD electrolytic capacitors are more likely to fail and show visible signs of damage compared to ceramic capacitors.\nD) Replacing all capacitors on the board is the most efficient way to repair a faulty graphics card.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the expert response, electrolytic capacitors are more prone to failure and often show visible signs of damage, such as bulging or rupturing. These are easier to identify visually compared to ceramic capacitors. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the expert explicitly states that detecting ceramic SMD capacitors with a multimeter is \"basically impossible in a practical sense.\"\n\nOption B, while mentioning a possible inspection method, is not the most reliable. The expert notes that \"the chances of seeing even a truly cracked cap are small.\"\n\nOption D is not recommended as it would be unnecessarily time-consuming and expensive. The expert suggests that unless your time is valued at \"pennies/hour,\" it's more efficient to replace the entire graphics card rather than attempting such extensive repairs.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the importance of focusing on electrolytic capacitors and their visible signs of failure, which aligns with the expert's advice for troubleshooting graphics card issues."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/13", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/104996", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/52925/"], "docs_id": 104996, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can't connect to a WiFi network.

The solution is to rename the profile file, removing the hyphen. For example, \"wireless-home\" could be renamed to \"wirelesshome\" or \"wireless_home\".

Currently I'm reading about the BCS theory, and how this works on a microscopic scale. I then get presented with this picture (Electron\\-Phonon Interaction):\n\n![Electron-Phonon interaction](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJiFm.png)\n\nNow, as far as I have understood, the electrons, when below $T\\_{C}$, attract the ions, but are too fast compared to the ions, which means that the ions contract after the electron is gone. This creates a higher potential in the area where they are \"squeezed\" together which the next electron is much more attracted to that usually. This again means that all electrons pretty much follow the same path, and somehow bond together in Cooper Pairs (Is this the way they get entangled?).\n\nNow, my main question is: Does this attraction of ions, after an electron has moved past them, not happen to a normal metal ? I mean, the electrons move in a normal metal, and also past ions. So don't they attract the ions as well, and make this attraction that another electron then can follow as well ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The attraction does happen at all temperature, but it is negligible if the temperature is too high. So the electrons do attract each other, but the thermal fluctuations do not allow for Cooper pairs to be stable.\n\nTo give an heuristic example : Imagine a lot of hydrogen atoms. The electrons are bound to their protons at zero temperature. If now you put the hydrogen atoms in a medium with a temperature high compare to 13eV (the binding energy), the electrons can take some energy from environment to leave their protons, and you don't have hydrogen atoms anymore, but a plasma (free protons and free electrons, interacting without forming bound states).

However, the stability of Cooper pairs depends on the balance between this attractive interaction and thermal fluctuations. At temperatures above Tc, thermal energy overwhelms the weak attraction between electrons, preventing the formation of stable Cooper pairs. Below Tc, thermal fluctuations are sufficiently weak, allowing Cooper pairs to form and remain stable, leading to superconductivity. This is analogous to the example given about hydrogen atoms in a plasma, where the binding only occurs when thermal energy is low compared to the binding energy."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/12/21", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/422266", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 422266, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: While there is no doubt that SO is great at uncovering problems and providing answers to specific needs and issues, many times general questions like \"How do I do X\" gets voted down, simply because a programmer may have no idea what specific question to ask.\n\nI am wondering whether a feature that would allow people to develop end\\-to\\-end tutorials, much like that on *[The Code Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Project)* , would be worthwhile.

This behavior was incentivized by the reputation system, which rewarded users for contributing to popular topics. As a result, the feature didn't provide the unique value it was intended to offer, and engagement with more specialized topics remained low.

It doesn't really matter whether or not you understand that term, but that's a 'simple ordinary CD audio' disk.\n\nMany HiFi CD players were not capable of reading more advanced formats such as MP3 CDs or DVD. They simply don't know what they are.\n\nCD Audio is actually burned using AIFF files not WAV, but the difference between these two files types is actually so small that your computer will just adjust the format on the fly as it burns the CD, so you won't have to make any special preparation for that.\n\nAll you should need is your folder full of WAV files, numbered if you want a specific play order, as it will burn them alphabetically. Once burned the names are discarded, as CDDA contains no track information.\n\nSet your software to burn a CD Audio disk \\& use an actual CD, not a DVD.\n\nIf you're using iTunes/Apple Music, then set up like this\u2026\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cNIC2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cNIC2.png)\n\nNote the burn speed is set very low. This is an old trick to get better results on older CD players with less tolerance of burn errors. A 2\\-second gap was the old default standard for audio CDs. you can set this how you wish.  \n\nI've not done this in a long time, but I think iTunes will up\\-convert on the fly even if your input tracks are AAC or MP3, so it will automatically handle any format as it burns the CD, so long as you set it as above.  \n\nUsing Sound Check is up to you \\[to balance the audio levels between tracks], but don't use CD Text if you want playback on such an old player."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student is trying to create a CD that will play on a 1997 CD player.

Apologies if it is too lengthy. Just ideation!) Here are some basic steps one can consider\\-\n\n1. Develop an instruction\\-set first. \nList each instruction and required number of operands.
