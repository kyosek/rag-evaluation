That should stop the water flowing about 1\", maybe less, to the top of the overflow tube.\n\nIf the water level still rises up and over the overflow tube, try the bend one more time, setting the blue ball even lower. If it still runs on, then the filler needs replaced, it is not stopping the water as it should.\n\nLooking at the picture again, check to see if the blue ball is hitting the side of the tank, not allowing it to rise high enough to stop the waterflow.

In terms of, how does this reflect on my original data from the regression?\n\nI'm totally stumped, thanks guys\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Linear regression in fact models the conditional expected values of your outcome. That means: if you knew the true values of the regression parameters (say $\\\\beta\\_0$ and $\\\\beta\\_1$), given a value of your predictor X, filling that out in the equation\n$$\nE\\[Y\\|X] \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X\n$$\nwill have you calculate the expected value for $Y$ over all (possible) observations that have this given value for $X$.\n\nHowever: you don't really expect any single $Y$ value for that given $X$ value to be exactly equal to the (conditional) mean. Not because your model is wrong, but because there are some effects you have not accounted for (e.g. measuring error). So these $Y$ values for a given $X$ values will fluctuate around the mean value (i.e. geometrically: around the point of the regression line for that $X$).\n\nThe normality assumption, now, says that the difference between the $Y$s and their matching $E\\[Y\\|X]$ follows a normal distribution with mean zero. This means, if you have an $X$ value, then you can sample a $Y$ value by first calculating $\\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X$ (i.e. again $E\\[Y\\|X]$, the point on the regression line), next sampling $\\\\epsilon$ from that normal distribution and adding them:\n$$\nY'\\=E\\[Y\\|X] \\+ \\\\epsilon\n$$\n\nIn short: this normal distribution represents the variability in your outcome *on top of* the variability explained by the model.\n\nNote: in most datasets, you don't have multiple $Y$ values for any given $X$ (unless your predictor set is categorical), but this normality goes for the whole population, not just the observations in your dataset.\n\nNote: I've done the reasoning for linear regression with one predictor, but the same goes for more: just replace \"line\" with \"hyperplane\" in the above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In linear regression, the assumption of normally distributed residuals implies that:\n\nA) The original data points are normally distributed around the regression line\nB) The predictor variables (X) follow a normal distribution\nC) The conditional distribution of Y given X is normal, with mean E[Y|X] = \u03b20 + \u03b21X and constant variance\nD) The regression coefficients (\u03b20 and \u03b21) are normally distributed\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C. The normality assumption in linear regression refers to the distribution of the residuals, which represent the difference between the observed Y values and the predicted Y values (E[Y|X]). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it confuses the distribution of the original data points with the distribution of the residuals. While the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, this doesn't necessarily mean the original data points are.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the normality assumption doesn't apply to the predictor variables (X). The distribution of X is not assumed in linear regression.\n\nOption C is correct. It accurately describes the normality assumption in linear regression. The conditional distribution of Y given X is assumed to be normal, centered around the mean E[Y|X] = \u03b20 + \u03b21X, with a constant variance. This is equivalent to saying that the residuals (Y - E[Y|X]) are normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the normality assumption doesn't apply to the regression coefficients.

Read on...\n\nNote:\n-----\n\nAs my understanding of this problem has evolved, so has this question. As a result the question itself is similar but the code example and underlying details/reasoning in the following body of text have changed significantly since the question was first asked.\n\n### Context\n\nI have an incredibly basic application (code at the bottom) that draws a single elipses in the drawRect: method of a custom UIView. The application demonstrates the difference in performance when the size of the elipses being drawn remains the same but the size of the custom UIView gets larger:\n\n![Small UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeyrI.png)\n\n![Large UIView](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RdFE.png)\n\nI ran the application on both an iPod 4th Gen running iOS 4\\.3\\.5 and an iPad 1st Gen running iOS 5\\.1\\.1 a series of times using custom UIViews of different sizes.  \n\nThe following table displays the results taken from the time profiler instrument:\n\n![Time profiler results](https://i.stack.imgur.com/53aLc.png)\n\nThe following instrument traces display the details of the two extremes for each device:\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9aUSA.png)\n\n**iOS 5\\.1\\.1 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 5.1.1 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HL6WF.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 320 x 460\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 320 x 460](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhWR0.png)\n\n**iOS 4\\.3\\.5 \\- (Custom UIView size 960 x 1380\\)**\n\n![iOS 4.3.5 - Custom UIView size 960 x 1380](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JweVL.png)\n\nAs you can (*hopefully*) see in 3 out of the 4 cases we get what we'd expect: the majority of time was spent performing the custom UIViews drawRect: method and each held 10fps.  \n\nBut the forth case shows a plumet in performance with the application struggling to hold 7fps while only drawing a single shape. The majority of time was spent copying memory during the UIView's CALayer's display method, specifically:\n\n\\[CALayer display] \\>  \n\n\\[CALayer \\_display] \\>  \n\nCABackingStoreUpdate \\>  \n\nCA::Render::ShmemBitmap::copy\\_pixels(CA::Render::ShmemBitmap const\\*, CGSRegionObject\\*) \\>  \n\nmemcpy$VARIANT$CortexA8\n\nNow it doesn't take a genius to see from the figures that something seriously wrong here. With a custom UIView of size 960 x 1380, iOS 4\\.3\\.5 spends over 4 times the amount of time copying memory around than it does drawing the entire view's contents.\n\n### Question\n\nNow, given the context, I ask my question again:\n\n**Why, on iOS 4\\.3\\.5, do 'large' (960 x 1380\\) custom UIView's perform CABackingStoreUpdate so inefficiently and how can I improve the performance of drawing operations?**\n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nI have also posted this question on the [Apple Developer forums](https://devforums.apple.com/message/791651#791651).\n\n### The Real Deal\n\nNow, obviously, I've reduced my real problem to the simplest reproducible case for the sake of this question. I'm actually attempting to animate a portion of a 960 x 1380 custom UIView that sits inside a UIScrollView.\n\nWhilst I appreciate the temptation to steer anyone towards OpenGL ES when they're not achieving the level of performance they want through Quartz 2D I ask that anyone that takes that route at least offer an explanation as to why Quartz 2D is struggling to perform even the most basic of drawing operations on iOS 4\\.3\\.5 where iOS 5\\.1\\.1 has no problem. As you can imagine I'm not thrilled about the idea of re\\-writing everything for this cornerstone case.\nThis also applies for people suggesting using Core Animation. Although I've used an elipses changing colour (a task perfectly suited for Core Animation) in the demo for the sake of simplicity, the drawing operations I'd actual like to perform are a large quantity of lines expanding over time, a drawing task Quartz 2D is ideal for (when it is performant!). Plus, again, this would require a re\\-write and doesn't help explain this odd performance problem.\n\n### Code\n\n> TViewController.m (Implementation of a standard view controller)\n\n```\n#import \"TViewController.h\"\n#import \"TCustomView.h\"\n\n// VERSION 1 features the custom UIView the same size as the screen.\n// VERSION 2 features the custom UIView nine times the size of the screen.\n#define VERSION 2\n\n@interface TViewController ()\n@property (strong, nonatomic) TCustomView *customView;\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSTimer *animationTimer;\n@end\n\n@implementation TViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    // Custom subview.\n    TCustomView *customView = [[TCustomView alloc] init];\n    customView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\n#if VERSION == 1\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 460.0f);\n#else\n    customView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 960.0f, 1380.0f);\n#endif\n\n    [self.view addSubview:customView];\n\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *singleTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];\n    [customView addGestureRecognizer:singleTap];\n\n    self.customView = customView;\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapGesture\n{\n    self.customView.value = 0.0f;\n\n    if (!self.animationTimer  || !self.animationTimer.isValid) {\n        self.animationTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.1 target:self selector:@selector(animationLoop) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];\n    }\n}\n\n#pragma mark - Timer Loop\n\n- (void)animationLoop\n{\n    // Update model here.

Originally 1024x1024 was the maximum size a UIView could be, and whilst this restriction has since been lifted it is entirely likely that views larger than this only became efficient in iOS5 and later.\n\nI'd conjecture that the excess memory copying you are seeing in iOS4 is due to UIKit using a full size memory buffer for the large UIView, but then having to copy appropriate sized tiles of it before they can be composited; and that in iOS5 and later they've either removed any restriction on the size of the tiles that can be composited, or changed the way UIKit renders for such large UIViews.\n\nIn terms of working around this bottleneck on iOS4 you can try tiling the area you want to cover with smaller UIViews. If you structure it as:\n\n```\n\n  Parent View - contains drawing and event related code\n    Tile View 1 - contains drawRect\n    ...\n    Tile View n - contains drawRect\n\n```\n\nIn each tile view, you can ask the parent view to render its contents after adjusting the graphics context's transform appropriately. This means you don't have to change the drawing code, it will just be invoked multiple times (there is a small overhead for this, but remember each invocation will be drawing only a portion of the whole view).\n\nNote that its important that the parent view does not have a drawRect method \\- otherwise UIKit will think you want to draw into it directly and it will create a backing store thus putting you back in the same situation.\n\nThere is also CATiledLayer that you could look into \\- this does the tiling for you but asynchronously; meaning that your drawing code and such has to handle being executed from one or more background threads."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: On iOS 4.3.5, a developer notices significant performance issues when working with large custom UIViews (960 x 1380 pixels). What is the most likely cause of this problem and what is an appropriate solution?\n\nA) The issue is caused by insufficient RAM on older iOS devices. The solution is to upgrade to newer hardware with more memory.\n\nB) The problem stems from an unoptimized code path in iOS 4 for views larger than 1024 pixels on any side. A viable solution is to tile the large view area using multiple smaller UIViews.\n\nC) The performance drop is due to inefficient use of Core Animation. The developer should rewrite the drawing code using OpenGL ES for better performance.\n\nD) The issue is inherent to Quartz 2D and cannot be resolved on iOS 4. The only solution is to upgrade all users to iOS 5 or later.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The problem is likely caused by an unoptimized code path in iOS 4 for views larger than 1024 pixels on any side. This is evidenced by the fact that the same hardware (iPod Touch 4th Gen and iPad 1st Gen) performs well on iOS 5.1.1 but poorly on iOS 4.3.5 with large views. The excess memory copying seen in the profiler suggests that iOS 4 is using a full-size memory buffer for the large UIView and then copying appropriate sized tiles for compositing.\n\nThe solution of tiling the large view area with smaller UIViews (each less than 1024 pixels on a side) is a practical workaround that doesn't require rewriting the entire drawing logic or upgrading hardware.

If the wires get flexed continuously during operation you may wish to go for a higher number of strands, thicker insulation. We use a very expensive PTFE/Polyimide insulation system, but I don't think you need that unless you're building military drones. \n\nThe terminations may be of more consequence than the wire itself\\- failures tend to happen near the terminations if the wire can bend sharply and repeatedly near (say) a crimped or soldered connection then it will tend to fail there.

Here's why:\n\n1. The 24 AWG size strikes a balance between flexibility and strength, being slightly thicker than 26 AWG.\n2.

This is why the law can be applied consistently in inertial frames despite acceleration being frame-dependent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the frame-dependence properties of force and acceleration. \nOption B is wrong because it incorrectly states that acceleration is frame-independent and that F = ma applies in all reference frames, including non-inertial ones. \nOption D is incorrect because while it correctly identifies acceleration as frame-dependent, it wrongly states that force is also frame-dependent and limits the validity of F = ma to only the rest frame of the observed object."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/09/12", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/218160", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/50818/"], "docs_id": 218160, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a paper that I am reading there is a following step:\n\n> Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $(x\\_k) \\\\subset X$ be a normalized sequence that converges weakly to $0$.\n>  Then $\\\\overline{co}(x\\_k)$ is a weakly compact set.\n\n(notice that $\\\\overline{co}(x\\_k)$ denotes the norm\\-closure of the convex hull of $(x\\_k)$.)\n\nI think that I managed to prove the claim, but I had to do a lot of manual checking.

Even though the schedule is set to \"* * * * *\" (which typically means every minute) in both groups, the group itself determines the actual frequency. Therefore, to ensure a task runs every minute, it should be placed in the 'index' group, as shown in option B.

Option D uses a custom group, which wouldn't have the same default behavior as the built-in 'index' group."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/02", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/218012", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/3554/"], "docs_id": 218012, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let us say I want to know why the sky is blue, my understanding is that I can ask you: \"Why do you think the sky is blue?\" regardless of whether you have thought about it before or not.

I am currently working on a gravitational waves video extension to my \"How Fast Is It\" video book on relativity theory. I have a question on the speed of gravitational waves. I understand that the field equations show that it is equal to the speed of light. My question goes one level deeper. My audience knows that the speed of light is fixed by two key characteristics of 'empty space' namely permittivity and permeability. The speed of a gravitational wave would be related to the elasticity of 'empty space'. Is it just a coincidence that these give the same result, or is there a deeper physics in play here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not really. The \"speed of light\" has very little to do with light; it is built into the actual geometry of spacetime independent of what matter fills it. \n\nIn particular, $\\\\epsilon\\_0$ and $\\\\mu\\_0$ don't tell us anything physical about the vacuum; looking at the (simplified) expressions\n$$E \\= \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon\\_0} \\\\frac{q}{r^2}, \\\\quad B \\= \\\\frac{\\\\mu\\_0}{4\\\\pi} \\\\frac{I \\\\times \\\\hat{r}}{r^2}$$\nwe see that $\\\\epsilon\\_0$ and $\\\\mu\\_0$ just define the units of the electric and magnetic fields.

For example, let's consider the simpler case of the harmonic oscillator, $\\\\partial\\_t^2 x \\= \\-\\\\omega^2 x$. We can rewrite this equation as\n$$y \\= \\\\alpha \\\\partial\\_t x, \\\\quad x \\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial\\_t y$$\nby introducing the intermediate quantity $y$. Then you could say $\\\\alpha$ is the \"resistance to motion\" while $\\\\omega^2/\\\\alpha$ is the \"restoring force\". But these quantities are totally meaningless because $\\\\alpha$ is arbitrary.

The documentation emphasizes that the \"speed of light\" is not specifically about light, but is a fundamental aspect of spacetime geometry.

I use `SAS PROC LOGISTIC` and I am using the output probabilities to classify each observation in to a specific category depending on which probability of the 18 probabilities output by SAS is the maximum. For example, if p10 is the highest probability of all 18 probabilities, then, I classify this observation in to category 10\\. Just to double check, I also use the estimates output by `proc logistic` and do explicit logistic calculations as follows: \n\n```\ncum prob, c1 = exp(&inter1 - modelScore)/(1 + exp(&inter1 - modelScore))\n...\ncum prob, c17 = exp(&inter17 - modelScore)/(1 + exp(&inter17 - modelScore)); \n\n```\n\nand calculate the individual probabilities p1 to p18 with `p1 = c1`, `p2 = c2 - p1`, and `p18 = 1 - c17`.\n\nThe problem is, the categories (2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 18\\) are never occurring in the predicted response.

So when some classes are not predicted that is simply because the model never gave them maximum probability. That might just be correct, and not necessary a reason for concern. So I disagree with the answer by @Nitin, proposing oversampling.\n\nYou might say: *but they did occur in the data*. Yes, but it might have been rare occurrences! never really the most probable outcome given the predictors in the model. You didn't give us a context, what your classes represent in the \"real world\". You have very unbalanced classes. That might be because some classes really are uncommon in your population, or it might be some problems with data collection. You didn't tell us. But it is difficult to see that over (or under)\\-sampling can achieve anything that cannot be achieved using weights. \n\nEven more important, you are using (ordinal) logistic regression, which is **not** a classifier, see [Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/127042/why-isnt-logistic-regression-called-logistic-classification). Logistic regression gives you estimated probabilities for class membership, and instead of just looking at the maximum predicted probability, you could compare the predicted probabilities with the population proportions. Or even pass to use some *proper scoring rule*. See [Using proper scoring rule to determine class membership from logistic regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/109851/using-proper-scoring-rule-to-determine-class-membership-from-logistic-regression) or [Is accuracy an improper scoring rule in a binary classification setting?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/359909/is-accuracy-an-improper-scoring-rule-in-a-binary-classification-setting). \n\nAbout the use of over/under\\-sampling, our community member @Frank Harrell have on this site (and elsewhere) commented against its use, see [Downsampling vs upsampling on the significance of the predictors in logistic regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/199230/downsampling-vs-upsampling-on-the-significance-of-the-predictors-in-logistic-reg) and [https://www.fharrell.com/post/class\\-damage/](https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an ordinal logistic regression model with 18 response categories (2 to 19), some categories are never occurring in the predicted response.

As explained in the documentation, when some categories are not predicted, it's often because the model never gave them maximum probability based on the given predictors. This doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the model or data. It may simply reflect that these categories, while present in the original data, are rarely or never the most probable outcome given the predictor variables.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the absence of certain categories in predictions doesn't automatically mean the model is wrong.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because oversampling is not recommended as a solution here. The documentation specifically argues against using oversampling, stating that anything achieved by oversampling can typically be achieved using weights instead.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no indication of a fault in the SAS algorithm. The behavior described is a normal possibility in logistic regression models, regardless of the software used.\n\nThe key point is understanding that logistic regression estimates probabilities for class membership, and the absence of certain categories in predictions may simply reflect their low probability of occurrence given the predictors in the model."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/15", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/48357", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/15341/"], "docs_id": 48357, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What I have done:\n\nI have few custom calculations to be done after placing an order for the customer in magento admin panel.

For instance,\n\n> *I have finished my work.*\n\n> *He has killed the mosquito.*\n\nSo it means action happened somewhere near in the past.

A [previous question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252914/how-to-get-the-hot-questions-by-some-query) asks how to get information on this via the data explorer, and it seems this is not possible.\n\nSo, I have a feature request: **please make the Hot Network Questions list auditable from within the Stack Exchange Data Explorer**.\n\nWhat I have in mind is a new table which contains:\n\n* the question id\n* the date and time the question got on the list\n* the date and time the question got off the list\n* if feasible, the number of views driven to the question via the sidebar\n* if feasible, the per\\-site breakdown of those referrals\n\t+ if that's not feasible, maybe a breakdown per category as separated on [the main SE list](https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentanswered), or just\n\t+ a per\\-site breakdown only for sites within the same category as the hosting site\n\nA table like this would go a long way to help understand the effects of the sidebar. For example, it would enable queries to dig out\n\n* HNQs that were closed after their time on the spotlight, or\n* that were heavily downvoted, possibly\n* preferentially by users with 200\\+ rep on the host site.\n\nThese give a better idea of what sorts of questions cause tensions within the site, which can help suggest ways to minimize those tensions, as well as provide a more accurate picture of the extent to which it is a problem.\n\nA table like this would also provide of information on how the sidebar *can* help a site, including\n\n* users whose first answer is on a HNQ that go on to become established users, and the questions that capture them\n* good answers (as e.g. with a high score accumulated after the spotlight goes away) posted during the spotlight period, and the questions that sparked them.\n\nA lot of the good that the HNQ does to a site is much harder to measure (as it is mostly in the form of traffic, what it does after landing, and whether those users return later or not) but a simple table like this provides a fair amount of insight.\n\nI am aware that any addition to the SEDE needs to be thought about carefully, and there is always a development cost, but this one looks rather simple to me. It rides on logging that is (hopefully) already done, and which otherwise should pose a very small performance hit, and the rest of the processing can be done offline. The table itself should be pretty light (particularly if it only contains on and off dates), and it represents a small subset of questions to begin with. If nothing else, can the dev team comment on how feasible this is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, [view\\-tracking and referrer\\-tracking are not feasible](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/238445/add-an-audit-log-to-record-when-particular-question-enters-and-leaves-hot-list/238531#238531); they'd be nice (for all sorts of things, starting with plain old question\\-views) but that's an insane amount of data. In theory, one could extract it from the raw request logs but in practice that's a massive headache for more than a few days at a time. \n\nAnd we're already talking about quite a bit of data. Figure that the hot list is refreshed every 3 minutes, and contains 100 entries (neither of those are probably quite right, but close enough for a napkin estimate). That's 48 thousand rows every day, pretty close to the number of PostHistory entries created per day on Stack Overflow. \n\nOf course, that's across all sites. It wouldn't really make much sense to put these in an individual site's database, since you'd want the full list to interpret them. So we'd have to put it somewhere else. Internally, there's a Sites database that holds on to stuff that isn't attached to a specific site, but exposing that in SEDE would be a bit odd. In any case, you'd have to be doing cross\\-database joins to get any of the information you're after, unless we denormalized it (as we do internally for *generating* the hot list)... But of course, that would increase the size of the data being stored as well.\n\nFinally, some of what you're after cannot be exposed in public data *ever*: revealing the reputation of voters.\n\nIn any case, this is a lot less trivial than it sounds. And that's not even getting into the secondary issues of which \"hot\" posts are actually *displayed* \\- the sidebar lists pick a random sample, and *those are cached too*. And of course, this does nothing for questions that get heavily\\-shared on social media or end up in the newsletter or whatever. \n\nNot gonna say this can never happen.

Usually the symbols used are taken from the IPA, but they represent only the sounds and their distribution and pronunciation **in that language**.\n\nFor instance, [this is the American English phonemic system](http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/modestproposal.pdf), from [Kenyon and Knott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_and_Knott).\n\nEnglish dictionaries published in the United States normally don't use phonemic pronunciation, preferring the system invented by Noah Webster, based on spelling instead of phonetics. Webster was a spelling reformer, and believed that the traditional English spelling could be used to indicate phonetics. He was wrong, but that hasn't influenced American dictionaries.\n\nEnglish dictionaries published elsewhere, or bilingual dictionaries, or dictionaries intended for language learners, normally do use standard phonemic transcription. If you have a bilingual dictionary, look at the pronunciations in the English part; they will normally use either the system of Kenyon and Knott (American) or a system of [RP (UK)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_pronunciation), which has some differences from American.

A resistor of 4 ohms (3\\.9 is the closest standard value) would limit the supply to its maximum rated current, but would also reduce the operating voltage of the LEDs to around 6 volts, which would no doubt result in unacceptable dimming and wasted power (about 10 watts). However, you might try just using a 1 or 1\\.5 ohm resistor; this would limit the maximum current to 12 amps while the LED capacitors charged, but only for a few milliseconds; the power supply might just ride that out fine.\n\nI had a similar problem with a switching adapter, but one where the LED string didn't even have the capacitor across the line.

Assume ZFC \\+ $\\\\kappa$ is measurable. Let $G$ be Prikry generic at $\\\\kappa$. So $\\\\kappa$ has cofinality $\\\\omega$ in $V\\[G]$. Claim: In $V\\[G]$, $V\\_\\\\kappa$ models $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$. In fact, if $f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\kappa$ is cofinal and $f$ is definable over $V\\_{\\\\kappa\\+1}^{V\\[G]}$ from parameters in $V\\_\\\\kappa$, then $f\\\\in V$, so $f$ is bounded. Since $V\\_\\\\kappa^{V\\[G]}\\=V\\_\\\\kappa^V$, this is a consequence of the fact that $\\\\mathrm{HOD}^{V\\[G]}\\_V\\=V$, i.e. if $X\\\\in V\\[G]$ and $X\\\\subseteq V$ and $X$ is definable over $V\\[G]$ from parameters in $V$, then $X\\\\in V$. (This follows from the fact that if $p,q$ are Prikry conditions then there are generics $G\\_p,G\\_q$ with $p\\\\in G\\_p$ and $q\\\\in G\\_q$ and $V\\[G\\_p]\\=V\\[G\\_q]$.)\n\nEdit 2: On the other hand, the kind of argument used in the paper \"Inner models from extended logics: Part 1\" referred to in @JasonChen's answer to show that in $L$, $V\\_\\\\alpha$ models $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$ iff $\\\\alpha$ is inaccessible, also works for the standard fine structural $L\\[\\\\mathbb{E}]$ models $M$ for short extenders, for instance if $M$ has no largest cardinal, and assuming $M$ has Mitchell\\-Steel indexing, though I expect it would also work with Jensen indexing. So if those models are indeed consistent through ZFC \\+ superstrongs, then one would need more than ZFC \\+ \\`\\`There is a superstrong extender'' to prove there is a non\\-inaccessible $\\\\alpha$ with $V\\_\\\\alpha$ modelling $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$.\n\n(The paper \"The definability of the extender sequence $\\\\mathbb{E}$ from $\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\upharpoonright\\\\aleph\\_1$ in $L\\[\\\\mathbb{E}]$\" contains enough to generalize the argument of Kennedy, Magidor, V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen for $L$. The definability there is all done over $\\\\mathcal{H}\\_\\\\kappa$s, as it's more convenient, but that can be translated into the cumulative hierarchy with the usual coding; in the present case that's only actually needed at the very top, since we can assume $V\\_\\\\alpha\\\\models\\\\mathrm{ZFC}$ to start with.)\n\nEdit 3: Following @AsafKaragila's suggestions in the comments, we have:\n\nClaim: Suppose $V\\_\\\\lambda$ models $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$ but $\\\\lambda$ is singular. Then for every $X\\\\in V\\_\\\\lambda$, $X^\\\\\\#$ exists. Moreover, there is a proper class inner model $M$ with a measurable cardinal.\n\nProof: For simplicity take $X\\=\\\\emptyset$. Suppose first that $0^\\\\\\#$ does not exist. Note first that since $V\\_\\\\lambda$ models ZFC, $\\\\lambda$ is a (singular) strong limit cardinal. By Jensen's covering lemma, $\\\\lambda$ is singular in $L$. Let $B$ be the constructibly least singularization. Then $B$ can be defined over $V\\_{\\\\lambda\\+1}$ (without parameters), which contradicts $\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$.\n\nThe argument for an inner model $M$ with a measurable is likewise, but using the Dodd\\-Jensen core model: We also have the appropriate version of covering for that core model $K\\=K^{\\\\mathrm{DJ}}$, and $K\\|(\\\\lambda^\\+)^K$ can also be defined in the codes over $V\\_{\\\\lambda\\+1}$, and hence the least singularization of $\\\\lambda$ in the $K$\\-order is definable.\n\nSo Edits 1 and 3 together give that ZFC \\+ \"There is a singular $\\\\lambda$ such that $V\\_\\\\lambda\\\\models\\\\mathfrak{ZFC}(\\\\mathsf{SOL})$\" is equiconsistent with ZFC \\+ \"There is a measurable cardinal\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the statement: \"There exists a singular cardinal \u03bb such that V_\u03bb models ZFC(SOL).\" Which of the following best describes the consistency strength of this statement relative to large cardinal axioms?\n\nA) It is equiconsistent with ZFC + \"There exists a supercompact cardinal\"\nB) It is equiconsistent with ZFC + \"There exists a measurable cardinal\"\nC) It is equiconsistent with ZFC + \"There exists a strongly compact cardinal\"\nD) It is equiconsistent with ZFC + \"There exists an inaccessible cardinal\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the consistency strength of the given statement in relation to large cardinal axioms. \n\nOption B is correct because:\n1.

Here are my models to give you some context:\n\n```\nclass Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :links\n  has_many :tags, :through => :links\n  validates :name, :ingredients, :directions, :presence => true\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :tags,\n        :allow_destroy => true,\n        :reject_if => :reject_tag\n\n  def reject_tag(a)\n      ...\n  end\nend\n\nclass Tag < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :links\n  has_many :recipes, :through => :links\nend\n\nclass Link < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :recipe\n  belongs_to :tag\nend\n\n```\n\nBasically each recipe has a list of tags through the link connector table and vice versa. The recipe form is accepting nested attributes for the tags. The behavior I want is for duplicated tags to not be entered into the tags table, but just a new link pointing to the already existing tag be created. So if I have a tag with name \"Healthy\" and enter a new recipe and add the tag \"Healthy\" to it I don't want duplicate \"Healthy\" tags in the tag table. All that's needed is a new entry in the link table linking the new recipe to the old tag.\n\nWhat's the 'rails' approach to doing this. Right now I'm trying to hack it by passing the recipe\\_id in a hidden input field into the :reject\\_if lambda and save a new link there. It works for editing an existing recipe, but not for creating a new one, since there is no recipe.id yet. This feels like a bad approach and I'm just not sure how to go about this.

Which of the following approaches would be the most appropriate and Rails-like solution to achieve this behavior when creating or updating recipes with associated tags?\n\nA) Override the save method in the Recipe model to check for existing tags before creating new ones.\n\nB) Use a before_save callback in the Recipe model to handle tag creation and association.\n\nC) Implement a custom validator in the Recipe model to reject duplicate tags.\n\nD) Use accepts_nested_attributes_for with a custom :reject_if proc in the Recipe model, combined with find_or_create_by in the Tag model.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is the most Rails-like and efficient approach to handling this scenario. By using accepts_nested_attributes_for with a custom :reject_if proc in the Recipe model, you can control how nested attributes for tags are processed. Combining this with find_or_create_by in the Tag model allows you to either find an existing tag or create a new one if it doesn't exist, preventing duplicates.\n\nThis approach is superior because:\n1. It leverages built-in Rails functionality (accepts_nested_attributes_for).\n2. It keeps the logic for tag creation/association within the appropriate models.\n3. It's more efficient than checking for existing tags on every save operation.\n4. It works for both creating new recipes and updating existing ones.\n\nThe other options (A, B, and C) are less ideal because they either involve more complex custom logic, may not work consistently for both new and existing recipes, or don't fully utilize Rails' built-in features for handling nested attributes and associations."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/12/30", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/148446", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/28182/"], "docs_id": 148446, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to pass on the move [Wish](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wish_(move)) to a line of Eevees, as well as get the right nature and IVs.

So if you are just keeping it in there to make a lot of Eevees, it will serve its purpose.\n\nIf you really want to keep wish on it, then you can remove it periodically from the daycare and rearrange the moves it has learned, so that Wish ends up at the bottom. The moves will be learnt by deleting ones from the top and adding a move to the bottom of the move list. This will give you a chance to keep wish on the Eevee while it is leveling and learning moves in the daycare.
