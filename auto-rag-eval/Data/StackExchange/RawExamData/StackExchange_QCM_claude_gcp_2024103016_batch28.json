The hex is made up of an equilateral triangle with sides of 9 meters (in meters because ArcMap IPoint X,Y properties are in meters).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: @om\\_henners' suggestion will work well, *especially* if you are creating the grid in the \"right\" way.\n\nThe *right* way views each grid point as being offset from an origin by the sum of integral multiples of two basis vectors. In projected coordinates a good choice of basis vectors for a triangular grid consists of one arbitrary vector of the desired length (*e.g.*, 9 meters) together with a rotation of that vector by 120 degrees. For example, if you want the bases of the triangles to be horizontal you can pick the first vector to be **e** \\= (9, 0\\). The second one would then equal **f** \\= (\\-9/2, Sqrt(3\\)\\*9/2\\) \\= (\\-4\\.5, 7\\.794229\\). Letting **O** \\= (Ox, Oy) be the coordinates of the origin, all other points on the grid are of the form\n\n*i* \\* **e** \\+ *j* \\* **f** \\+ **O**\n\nwhere *i* and *j* are integers. Here's the punchline: to compensate for the distortion in geographic coordinates, divide the first coordinate of each basis vector by the cosine of the latitude, convert all offsets to degrees, but otherwise *everything else remains the same.*\n\nFor example, at latitude 40 degrees the cosine is 0\\.766044\\. This converts **e** to **e'** \\= (9/0\\.766044, 0\\) \\= (11\\.74867, 0\\) and **f** becomes **f'** \\= (\\-4\\.5/0\\.766044, 7\\.794229\\) \\= (\\-5\\.874333, 7\\.794229\\). Now convert these four coordinates to degrees: division by 111,111 (meters per degree) is usually close enough. Using these vectors instead of **e** and **f** in the grid formula, but keeping **O** at the same location (and using the same sets of *i* and *j* values) lays out your grid in geographic coordinates. Over these short distances (up to 144 feet in this case, or out to several kilometers in general) you can get extremely high accuracy by first adjusting the latitude to a spherically\\-equivalent latitude before computing the cosine, but typically the error is so small (much less than 1%) that it doesn't matter.\n\nThe vector approach is illustrated in an [old article of mine](http://www.quantdec.com/sample).\n\nBTW, a nice feature is that you can easily rotate and shift the grid. To rotate it, just rotate the *original* basis vectors **e** and **f** by the desired amount, adjust their first coordinates by the cosine, and then recompute the grid points as linear combinations of these adjusted rotated basis vectors. To shift the grid, just shift the origin **O**. Thus you are no longer a slave to the coordinate system: you can orient and position the grid as needed for the application. Another nice feature is that *every mathematically possible regular grid* can be constructed this way. Just change **e** and **f**. For example, when **f** is at 90 degrees to **e** you will create a rectangular grid."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An application is being developed in ArcMap to generate a grid of points in a hexagonal pattern within a 144-foot radius circle.

After all, what it does is use a transformer to step down high voltage to something lower than then uses switching converters to step it even lower to regulate. If anything your PSU would just brownout, not fry. Not to mention it is rated as low as 100V.\n\nThat said, a slow multi\\-meter won't display line spikes that would actually damage your PSU. You need an oscilloscope that graphs the voltage for that. By spike, I do not mean a rise to normal voltage levels. I mean a rise above normal levels. But an electric heater should be mostly resistive not very inductive to begin with to produce voltage spikes higher than the line voltage.\n\nIf you are worried that your PSU's *line regulation* might not be fast enough to react to the rise in input voltage after extended low input voltage and result in too high of a voltage on the output, I wouldn't be too concerned since there are massive output capacitors that can buffer that.

Running ZooKeeper with only 2 members is not recommended because it can lead to a situation where there's no clear majority in case of a failure or network partition. The majority constraint is crucial because it ensures that only one portion of the cluster (the majority) can make changes during a partition.

Social tactics are another core part of playing impostor but that\u2019s so broad I can\u2019t address it here.\n\nThe easiest step you could take to reduce the frequency the corpses you make are discovered is to use your tools of sabotage. As an impostor you have a variety of abilities that allow you to disrupt the game and restructure the priorities of the crewmates.\n\nThe simplest and one of the most effective tactics is to wait until you are alone with a crewmate, sabotage a crisis on the opposite side of the ship, and immediately kill the solo crewmate. The crisis will draw other crewmates to fix it, which brings them away from the body, allowing you to slip away and have plausible deniability. The best part? If the crewmates ignore the crisis and let the timer reach zero then. you win!\n\nThe second critical sabotage you can create is to kill the lights. This reduces the crewmate\u2019s vision to about what is an arm\u2019s reach away, anything outside of that length is obscured. While the lights are off you, as an impostor, retain full perception and can seek out and kill with a high level of impunity. Even in a crowded room you can still kill unseen if the lights are out.\n\nThe last sabotage you can inflict is locking doors to a hallway. This is still a powerful tool if used properly. The core use of locking a door is to briefly keep people out of a room, or to purposefully lock people in a room. Locking others out of a room allows you to kill and vent away while guaranteeing there are no witnesses. Likewise, trapping somebody in a room may give you enough time to finish your kill cool down and strike again before your quarry is able to escape. Both forms of door sabotage are situational, but in the right situations they can be used to great effect.\n\nThere are an endless supply of tips to maximize your killing potential when playing as impostor \\- but the best teacher is practice. As you play more rounds of Among Us you\u2019ll learn through trial and error what tactics work best and what tactics get you caught. It\u2019s not fun to be caught now but as you play more sessions your skill level will increase and you will become more lethal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As an Impostor in Among Us, which combination of strategies is most effective for avoiding detection after killing a crewmate?\n\nA) Self-reporting the body immediately and claiming innocence\nB) Running away from the body as quickly as possible\nC) Sabotaging a crisis on the opposite side of the ship, then killing an isolated crewmate\nD) Venting immediately after each kill to escape the scene\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most effective strategy according to the documentation. Sabotaging a crisis on the opposite side of the ship draws other crewmates away from your location, allowing you to kill an isolated crewmate with less risk of discovery. This provides plausible deniability and reduces the chances of the body being found quickly.\n\nOption A (self-reporting) is mentioned as a risky strategy that often leads to losing. \nOption B (running away quickly) is also noted as a strategy that frequently results in getting caught. \nOption D (venting immediately) is not directly addressed, but the documentation mentions that being caught venting leads to being voted out.\n\nThe correct strategy combines the use of sabotage to manipulate crewmate movement, isolating a target, and timing the kill to minimize the risk of discovery.

Since $L^{\\-}$ is free, it admits a section\n$L^{\\-} \\\\rightarrow L$, and hence the kernel\n$L^{\\+}$ of $L \\\\rightarrow L^{\\-}$ is also free. Thus\nthe existence of a free rank one quotient asked\nfor in the question is equivalent\nto the existence of the exact sequence above.)\n\nThe answer to this question, in general, is no. The following argument\nis implicitly contained in papers of Wiese on the failure of multiplicity\none and weight one forms.\n\nThe action of $G\\_{\\\\Q\\_p}$ on $L^{\\+}$ is unramified and so acts\nvia $G\\_{\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p}$. Thus $\\\\Frob\\_p$ acts on a basis vector\nas multiplication by some element of $\\\\T$. Since $\\\\T$ is determined\nby its action on classical eigenforms,\none may identify this element with the Hecke operator $U$. In particular,\n$U \\\\in \\\\T$ (it wasn't clear whether your $\\\\T$ included $U$ or not).\n\nThe exact sequence remains exact after tensoring with $\\\\T/\\\\m$,\nfor dimension reasons. It follows that the sequence is split as a sequence\nof $\\\\T$\\-modules.

If $A$ is the Hasse invariant, then\nthen $Af$ and $f^p$ are both mod\\-$p$ modular forms of weight $p$. One can check\nthat all elements of the $\\\\F\\_p$\\-vector space $\\\\{Af,f^p\\\\}$ are eigenvalues for all the Hecke operators\n$T\\_l$ for $(l,p) \\= 1$, but the operator $T$ (and so $U$, which is the\nsame as $T$ in weight $\\> 1$) satisfies \n$(U \\- \\\\lambda)^2 \\= 0$ but does not act by a scalar.

One approach for reducing this bias is to run the lasso to identify the set of non\\-zero coefficients, and then fit an unrestricted linear model to the selected set of features. This is not always feasible, if the selected set is large. Alternatively, one can use the lasso to select the set of non\\-zero predictors, and then apply the lasso again, but using only the selected predictors from the first step. This is known as the relaxed lasso (Meinshausen, 2007\\). The idea is to use cross\\-validation to estimate the initial penalty parameter for the lasso, and then again for a second penalty parameter applied to the selected set of predictors. Since Statistical consistency means as the sample size grows, the estimates converge to the true values. The variables in the second step have less \u201ccompetition\u201d from noise variables, cross\\-validation will tend to pick a smaller value for \u03bb, and hence their coefficients will be shrunken less than those in the initial estimate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It looks like the summary table for logit always gives a NaN standard error for parameters whose coefficient estimate is shrunk to zero.

There are various policies for when to release, and which works best is mostly a matter of opinion and the quirks of the project and its user base. Some common options are:\n\n* Some project release once every X time units, regardless of how many or few changes were done.\n* Some projects release once a subjective threshold of \"enough changes\" is reached.\n* Some projects have milestones: \"We'll release vX.Y once we have this thing and that thing done\".\n* A mix of the above.\n\nMost projects, even when they normally adhere to one of the above, can release out\\-of\\-line hot fixes when a particular nasty bug was released in the wild.\n\nConversely, if you put out new releases so rarely (or never) that most people just track git `master`, then you fail at semver because these people don't get any backwards compatibility guarantees.

This aligns with semantic versioning principles, which associate version numbers with proper releases rather than individual commits. Making a single release for multiple bug fixes is more efficient, reduces user update fatigue, and prevents version number inflation. The PATCH version is incremented once per release, not per individual fix.

Even without this, it appears from your histogram that it is probably leptokurtic; it has a higher peak, lower shoulders and fatter tail than the normal distribution. From the histogram it looks quite close to a [Pearson Type VI distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_distribution#The_Pearson_type_VI_distribution) with positive excess kurtosis and possibly some slight positive skew. Fitting the distribution to this family would probably give a reasonable fit.\n\nDeviation from normality of errors is not fatal for a regression model, since many of the results are robust to deviations from this distributional assuption. This deviation from normality means that your underlying error distribution is probably slightly leptokurtic. Your coefficient estimates should still be fine, but you will want to take the excess kurtosis into account if you construct prediction intervals for individual values. The excess kurtosis means that there is a higher probability of high errors in either direction than would be predicted by the normal regression model."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducted a regression analysis and obtained the residual plots shown in the images.

Take for instance\n\n```\nA = ( 3 * B ) + C\n\n```\n\nIt is clear that the final result must end up in A, because the statement says so. But most CPU's can't do this calculation without first calculating ( 3 \\* B ). So where should that value end up? That depends on the type of CPU architecture.

Now why is Perl not that popular anymore and instead we use Java, Python, Go, PHP, C\\# and everything but Perl? To me it seems that Perl should be good since it has had long time to mature. What happened that causes Perl to lose its applicability as server language?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The model for web programming in the 90's was to launch an application that used the [common gateway interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) to launch another process that was forked by the web server.\n\nForking a process is a rather heavy weight operation. For perl, this means spinning up the interpreter, running it, and then letting the process terminate. When working with heavy loads, this became prohibitively expensive (memory and cpu).\n\nFastCGI reduced the overhead of CGIs by reusing the process, cutting back on the heavy forking of a process. This is more inline with application servers, which leads us to...\n\nThe development approach today is to have an application server in a language that has a light weight process threading model, which can handle very large loads (compared to the days of CGI). Of these you have Java, Go, and C\\# which follow this approach.\n\nThis doesn't mean perl is out. There are application servers for Perl. One rarely hears of Catalyst compared to things such as Zope, NodeJS, or the plethora of Java App servers.\n\nPart of this is timing. While the development of Java application servers was going on, Perl has been a bit bogged down with work on perl 6 (any ~~day~~ year now) and so the community as a whole let that development path slip by.\n\nI *personally* discount the discipline of languages as a reason that perl has missed out pointing to javascript, php and ruby as three examples of similarly undisciplined languages that remain popular in the web area.\n\nLanguages such as Java and C\\# (and to an extent, python) with major company backing (Sun/Oracle, Microsoft, Google) and, yes, more discipline in the language are more appealing to enterprise development."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes why Perl lost popularity as a server-side language for web development compared to languages like Java, Python, and C#?\n\nA) Perl's syntax became too complex for modern web development needs\nB) The shift from CGI to application servers, combined with Perl's slower adoption of this model\nC) Perl's inability to handle heavy loads compared to newer languages\nD) The rise of JavaScript made Perl obsolete for web development\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. The documentation explains that web development shifted from the CGI model, where processes were forked for each request, to an application server model with lightweight threading. While Perl could adapt to this model (with tools like Catalyst), its community was focused on other developments (like Perl 6), causing it to lag behind in adopting the application server approach. This, combined with the strong backing of languages like Java and C# by major companies, led to Perl's decline in popularity for web development.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation doesn't mention Perl's syntax complexity as a factor in its declining popularity.\n\nOption C is not accurate because the issue wasn't Perl's inability to handle loads, but rather the shift in the development model itself.\n\nOption D is incorrect because JavaScript's rise isn't mentioned as a factor in Perl's decline for server-side development.

In idiomatic expressions like \"smell a rat,\" \"smells fishy,\" or \"smell fear,\" the verb \"smell\" is used metaphorically to represent an intuitive perception or a gut feeling about a situation or person.

Context switching: With more threads than available cores, the OS must frequently switch between threads, saving and restoring register states. This overhead increases with more threads.\n\n2. Cache invalidation: As threads share the same CPU, they may work on different data sets, causing frequent cache misses and reloads, which significantly impacts performance on modern CPUs.\n\n3.

The specs you should be most concerned with are the output voltage (12V) and current (no less than 850mA \\- more is ok)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrical engineer is reviewing the specifications of a DC adapter for a small low-RPM electric motor.

Which of the following statements is most accurate and complete?\n\nA) The adapter can be safely used with 120V mains, as most modern adapters are designed to work with a range of input voltages.\n\nB) The adapter cannot be used with 120V mains, as it will likely output only 6.5V DC, resulting in poor motor performance and potential stalling.\n\nC) The adapter can be used with 120V mains if a step-up transformer is added to increase the voltage to 220V first.\n\nD) The adapter is likely a switch-mode power supply and can automatically adjust to different input voltages, making it safe to use with 120V mains.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The adapter's input specification clearly states AC 220V without providing a range, suggesting it's designed for a specific input voltage.\n2. Given the VA rating, it's likely a simple transformer-based adapter (Option 1 in the documentation).\n3. If used with 120V input, the output voltage would be reduced proportionally: (12V / 220V) * 120V \u2248 6.5V DC.\n4. This reduced voltage would lead to poor motor performance and increased risk of stalling, potentially damaging the motor or adapter.\n5. The lack of a wide input range specification (e.g., 100-240V) indicates it's not designed for various input voltages.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they assume the adapter can handle different input voltages, which is not supported by the given specifications.

The documentation explicitly states that the subset sum problem with target number zero is reducible to the problem of maximizing the real part of the product of a subset of complex numbers on the unit circle. This reduction is used to prove that the latter problem is NP-hard.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the problem is proven to be NP-hard, which means it's unlikely to have a polynomial-time solution unless P=NP.\n\nOption C is false because NP-hard problems generally become more difficult as the input size increases, and cannot be solved in constant time.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the proof doesn't involve the traveling salesman problem.

As there are only two items, never use an Oxford comma (also known as a [serial comma](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/412/should-i-put-a-comma-before-the-last-item-in-a-list/).)\n\nYou might prefer to write the sentence as two clauses, so you repeat the subject, and you make the logic more clear.

With the same memory usage as it has before the problem:\n\n* RAM total 378\\.48 GB\n* RAM used 336\\.15 GB\n* RAM free 42\\.33 GB\n* SWAP total 500\\.24 MB\n* SWAP used 344\\.55 MB\n* SWAP free 155\\.69 MB\n\nIs it possible that server somehow counts memory badly? Or is there something I'm missing?\n\nOne thing comes to my mind, that host puts all free memory in buffers and cache and then suffers from memory shortage (invokes OOM\\-killer)? But that, i think, shouldnt happen, right? Also, that doesnt explain the behavior before the killing.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n---\n\nso today the problem occurs again, here is the content of /proc/meminfo: \n\n```\nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:         9720268 kB\nBuffers:        53354000 kB\nCached:            22196 kB\nSwapCached:       343964 kB\nActive:         331872796 kB\nInactive:       41283992 kB\nActive(anon):   305458432 kB\nInactive(anon): 14322324 kB\nActive(file):   26414364 kB\nInactive(file): 26961668 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:              0 kB\nDirty:                48 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      319438656 kB\nMapped:             8536 kB\nShmem:               164 kB\nSlab:            9052784 kB\nSReclaimable:    2014752 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7038032 kB\nKernelStack:        8064 kB\nPageTables:       650892 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   383832752 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31502336 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nIt seems that all the \"free\" memory is spent in buffers.\n\n---\n\nAfter hints from @Matthew Ife about memory fragmentation, I have compacted the memory and also dropped the caches (to free up 60 GBs in buffers) on Host, with those commands:\n\n```\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\necho 1 >/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory\n\n```\n\nHere is what memory fragmentation looks like now:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 2398537 469407 144288  97224  58276  24155   8153   3141   1299    451     75 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 9182926 2727543 648104  81843   7915   1267    244     67      3      1      0\n\n```\n\n---\n\nupdate 2014/11/25 \\- server is overloaded again:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/buddyinfo\nNode 0, zone      DMA      2      1      2      2      2      1      0      0      1      1      3 \nNode 0, zone    DMA32     12     12     13     16     10      5      7     10      9      6     98 \nNode 0, zone   Normal 4374385  85408      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \nNode 1, zone   Normal 1830850 261703    460     14      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \n\n# cat /proc/meminfo \nMemTotal:       396867932 kB\nMemFree:        28038892 kB\nBuffers:        49126656 kB\nCached:            19088 kB\nSwapCached:       303624 kB\nActive:         305426204 kB\nInactive:       49729776 kB\nActive(anon):   292040988 kB\nInactive(anon): 13969376 kB\nActive(file):   13385216 kB\nInactive(file): 35760400 kB\nUnevictable:           0 kB\nMlocked:               0 kB\nSwapTotal:        512248 kB\nSwapFree:             20 kB\nDirty:                28 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:      305706632 kB\nMapped:             9324 kB\nShmem:               124 kB\nSlab:            8616228 kB\nSReclaimable:    1580736 kB\nSUnreclaim:      7035492 kB\nKernelStack:        8200 kB\nPageTables:       702268 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    198946212 kB\nCommitted_AS:   384014048 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:     1824832 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34157271228 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:  31670272 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:        7852 kB\nDirectMap2M:     3102720 kB\nDirectMap1G:    399507456 kB\n\n```\n\nand in syslog are some page allocation failures:\n\n```\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: qemu_wl50: page allocation failure. order:4, mode:0x20\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Pid: 4444, comm: qemu_wl50 Not tainted 2.6.32-431.17.1.el6.x86_64 #1\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: Call Trace:\nNov 25 09:14:07 wv2-f302 kernel: <IRQ>  [<ffffffff8112f64a>] ?

Sometimes there are layers to these functions, so that `func1` calls `func2` calls `func3` calls `func4`, where a parameter of `func4` is passed through all the way from `func1`. In this case, it would not make sense to make any of these parameters instance/class attributes.\n\nA 1\\-layer example:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    # Calculate E with my_func args\n    E = some_calculations(A, B)\n\n    # Call helper, passing through some parameters\n    return helper(C=C, D=D, E=E)\n\ndef helper(c, d, e):\n    return some_other_calculations(C, D, E)\n\n```\n\nI'm trying to write some dosctrings for these functions, and I am having trouble formulating a way to effecitvely document the arguments that are passed through to the helper function(s).\n\nIn particular, I see a few options:\n\n### Method 1\n\nPoint to `helper`'s dosctring:\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: See `helper` \n    :param D: See `helper`\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Only ever have to update/maintain one description of a given parameter\n\n**CON:** If we add another function `outer_func` that calls `my_func` and passes `C` and `D` to it, which in turn passes `C` and `D` to helper, we will have to point to either `my_func` or `helper`.\n\nIn the former case this would lead to another forwarding, daisy\\-chaining the reader through multiple dosctrings just to get a description. In the latter case, it would be unclear where in `outer_func` that `helper` is called.\n\n### Method 2\n\nSimply copy the description for each function that uses it\n\n```py\ndef my_func(A, B, C, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some stuff\n    :param A: Parameter A description\n    :param B: Parameter B description\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return helper(...)\n\ndef helper(C, D, E)\n    \"\"\"\n    Do some other stuff\n    :param C: Parameter C description\n    :param D: Parameter D description\n    :param E: Parameter E description\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return some_other_calculations(...)\n\n```\n\n**PRO:** Do not have to look through other functions to understand the argument\n\n**CON:** Obviously, multiple descriptions will have to be maintained.

Doing this exposes implementation details that are not relevant to the use case your function fulfills. Instead, use the docstring comments to describe that parameter within the context of the method that calls the helper.\n\nThe docstring comments for the helper method should probably be very general. Presumably the helper is used in a larger number of use cases, therefore the phrasing used to describe the helper method parameters will be very generic. The docstring comments for the method which calls the helper should be use case\\-specific.\n\nThe names of functions chosen for the question are too generic to give you specific advice. Instead, let's use a contrived example that at least gives us a concrete use case.\n\nSay you have a method which formats the price for an entire shopping cart. That method calls a helper to format a number as currency (the helper method).\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nIn each case, phrase docstring comments so they make sense within the context the method gets used. The `format_currency` method is general purpose, so the words used to describe the parameters should also be general purpose. Frankly, even the parameter names should be general purpose:\n\n```py\ndef format_currency(amount, currency_format)\n  # :param amount: The amount to format as currency\n  # :param currency_format: A currency format string\n  return ...\n\n```\n\nThe words \"amount\" and \"currency format\" can be applied to any use case where you have a number that should be formatted as currency.\n\nThe `format_shopping_cart_price` method is use case\\-specific: it formats the total price of a shopping cart as currency. Even though the `currency_format` parameter is simply passed to the helper method, the docstring comment can be tailored to the use case of formatting the shopping cart price:\n\n```py\ndef format_shopping_cart_price(shopping_cart, currency_format)\n  # :param shopping_cart: The shopping cart whose total price should be formatted as currency\n  # :param currency_format: The currency format string used to format the shopping cart price\n  return format_currency(shopping_cart.price, currency_format)\n\n```\n\nIn the example above, the term \"amount\" is basically replaced by \"shopping cart price\". Copying and pasting docstring comments, while easy, isn't necessarily desirable. You miss opportunities to use docstring comments to communicate use case\\-specific information that aids other programmers in calling your methods.\n\nI'll end this with *one more* possible solution to this conundrum. Does a \"helper\" method need docstring comments? Does your other function need docstring comments? By carefully choosing class, method, and parameter names you can often skip writing comments. The names of things are enough of a description that docstring comments are extra work for no extra value."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When documenting functions that pass parameters to helper functions, which approach is most appropriate according to the top answer?\n\nA) Always refer to the helper function's docstring for parameter descriptions\nB) Copy and paste parameter descriptions from the helper function\nC) Provide brief descriptions and refer to the helper function for more details\nD) Tailor parameter descriptions to the specific use case of the calling function\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that you should not document the fact that a parameter is passed to another function, as this exposes unnecessary implementation details. Instead, the recommendation is to describe parameters within the context of the method that calls the helper. The docstring for the calling function should be use case-specific, while the helper function's docstring can be more general. This approach allows for more meaningful documentation that aids other programmers in understanding and using the functions correctly."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/10", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/380847", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/6101/"], "docs_id": 380847, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\\\\mathbb R^n$ with $n\\\\ge 2$ (say if you like $n\\=2$, which is possibly sufficiently representative).\n\n**Q:** *Does there exist a closed simple curve $u:\\\\mathbb S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb R^n $ such that $K\\\\cup u(\\\\mathbb S^1 )$ is connected?*\n\nThe set $K$ may have uncountably many connected components, and $u$ has to meet them all. Yet this does not seem a serious obstruction. For instance, the cartesian square of the Cantor set can be connected by some simple self\\-similar curve (necessarily of infinite length; in fact I think of dimension at least $4/3$), e.g. just connecting suitably the four main square clusters between them by segments, and then iterating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not always.\n\nLet $K$ be a subset of an ambient space $V$ ($V\\=\\\\mathbf{R}^2$ is fine, but doesn't matter) that is the closure of a discrete subset $D$, such that $K\\-D$ is homeomorphic to a segment. This exists in $\\\\mathbf{R}^n$ for $n\\\\ge 2$.\n\nThen every closed subset of $V$ that meets every component of $K$ has to contain all $D$, and hence contains its closure, and hence contains $S$. But if $j:\\[0,1]\\\\to C$ is an injection of a segment in a circle, the interior of $j(\\[0,1])$ in $C$ is equal to exactly $j(\\\\mathopen]0,1\\\\mathclose\\[)$; in particular, $j(\\[0,1])$ can't have empty interior in $C$.\n\nBut if $C$ were a circle within $V$ meeting every connected component of $K$, we would have $D\\\\subset C$, hence $K\\\\subset C$. Since $j(S)\\=S$ has empty interior in $K$ and $K\\\\subset C$, it has empty interior in $C$. This is a contradiction with the above fact.\n\n\\[Edit: I initially described $K$ as subset of the sine curve, but this doesn't matter and complicates the description.]\n\n---\n\nMinor variant: let $M$ be any compact subset with empty interior, which is not homeomorphic to any subset of a circle (e.g., the whole sine example in the plane, a sphere in a higher space). Let $D$ a discrete subset of $\\\\mathbf{R}^n$ whose set of accumulation points is exactly $M$ (this exists).

The proof outlined in the documentation shows that it's impossible to find a simple closed curve that connects all components of K in this case. \n\nThe key points are:\n1) Any closed subset meeting every component of K must contain all of D and its closure, including K-D (the segment).\n2) If a simple closed curve C contained K, then K-D (the segment) would have to have empty interior in C.\n3) However, any homeomorphic image of a segment in a circle must have non-empty interior in that circle.\n\nThis contradiction proves that no simple closed curve can connect all components of K in this scenario, making option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is false as the proof shows a counterexample.

Do you feel there are any issues with the relative amount and types of participation on ServerFault of long\\-term, high\\-rep users compared to newer, lower\\-rep users? If so, what would you try to do as a moderator to address these issues?\n\nI think it's unfortunate that many long\\-term, high\\-rep users have largely stopped participating on ServerFault, there are fewer highly experienced sysadmins posting excellent answers than there used to be. I don't think there's much that a single moderator can do to either bring back the users who left or to develop new high\\-rep users.\n\nFor example, I've tried a few times over the years to focus on voting for new users who were fairly active to see if that encouraged them to stick around, but I didn't see any sign of it working. I don't think a single person or a single moderator can do much to encourage people to stick around and become long\\-term users.\n\n> 2. What time zone are you in?

Moderators see the review\\-queues a little differently. How do you see yourself handling answers from a new user that could be great with a little clarification, yet has earned at least one `not an answer` flag?\n\nThe ideal thing to have happen with an answer that could be improved by a bit of cleanup is for it to be edited, and moderators can do that as can many regular users. But the whole point of review queues is that it *shouldn't* be just moderators handling that sort of clean up, so I think most of those cases would be better dealt with by comments \\- suggesting what could make it a better answer.\n\n> 4. What do you believe a moderators role is, in cultivating good content for the site? With the decline in both new content and votes, do you believe as a moderator this should affect your behavior?\n\nAlthough moderators have some tools for eliminating bad content, I don't think they should be soley responsible for it; regular users need to be involved as well. When it comes to encouraging good content, I think moderators should lead by example to some extent (e.g. by editing and leaving constructive comments), but they can't be expected to do all the editing and commenting.\n\n> 5. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?\n\nI think the usual tool for dealing with this \\- a temporary ban \\- is the right way to go. Explain to the user what the problem is and use the banning system to give them a chance to cool off.\n\n> 6.

Web Application and Rich Internet Application are one and the same thing.\n\nMake it simple...\n\n* A Website is a set of pages (static or dynamic) and is fairly simple to build and maintain.\n* A more complex and feature rich manifestation of the same website which includes technologies/paradigms/practices that **evolved** in the last 5 years is what they call a Web Application.\n\n\t+ Technologies: JavaScript, REST, Social Web, APIs, improved standards, NoSQL, Clouds, etc.\n\t+ Paradigms: Ajax, perceived responsiveness, UX, mashups, etc.\n\t+ Practices: accessibility, multiple devices, etc.\n\nSo, Gmail is NOT the regular thing, it is one of THE most successful Web Applications (or RIA if you will).\n\nNext, to answer you original question...\n\nCreating a *Desktop\\-cum\\-Web* application is a non\\-trivial task.

As I understand it, you have a capacitor, resistor, and LED all in series, and you want to know how things decay if the capacitor starts out initially charged up.\n\nAt first apporoximation, you can consider the LED a voltage source. That means the current will decay just as if the LED wasn't there and the cap was charged up to the LED voltage less than what it really was. This is now a simple R\\-C systems which follows a basic exponential decay with a time constant of RC, which it seems you already understand. The question of when the LED goes \"off\" then comes down to at what current you consider the brightness to be low enough to be off. This can vary a lot by the efficiency of the LED, ambient light level, and how obvious \"on\" is supposed to be. For example, if the cap is initially charged so that the initial current is 20 mA (a common maximum for LEDs) and you consider 1 mA the \"off\" level, then the on time will be the 95% decay time, which is 3\\.0 time constants.\n\nAs I said, this was the basic first approximation where the LED has a fixed voltage accross it. That will be largely true, but of course its voltage will drop with current somewhat. For practicle purposes, this is a small effect compared to the slop of deciding what current level \"off\" really is, unless that current is small, like less than a mA."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A circuit contains a capacitor (C = 100 \u03bcF), resistor (R = 1 k\u03a9), and LED (threshold voltage Us = 2V) in series.

The effective initial voltage across the RC circuit is therefore 5V - 2V = 3V. The current through the LED, which determines its brightness, follows an exponential decay with time constant \u03c4 = RC. \n\nTo reach 5% of the initial value, we need to wait for 3 time constants (3\u03c4), as this results in approximately 5% of the initial current:\n\ne^(-3) \u2248 0.0498 \u2248 5%\n\nTherefore, after 3 time constants, the LED's brightness will be reduced to about 5% of its initial value.\n\nNote: This approximation assumes the LED's voltage remains constant, which is a reasonable first-order approximation for most practical purposes."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/15", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8299", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3567/"], "docs_id": 8299, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: While trying to make sense of MDL and stochastic complexity, I found this previous question: [Measures of model complexity](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2828), in which Yaroslav Bulatov defines model complexity as \"how hard it is to learn from limited data.\"\n\nIt is not clear to me how Minimal Description Length (MDL) measures this.

While it's true that 27\" iMacs support video input via Mini DisplayPort, this doesn't address the situation for 24\" iMacs, which is the focus of the question."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/03/16", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/392658", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/188248/"], "docs_id": 392658, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) 2 dimensional or 3 Dimensional. If they were 3 Dimensional it would make more sense that wherever you approach it the gravity would be the same. But images on the internet show it as a 2 dimensional body. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Black holes are 3 dimensional. They are simply celestial bodies like planets or stars but have so much mass that even light cannot escape their gravity if it is within a certain distance from them.\n\nImages on the internet probably show a black hole's potential energy curve (even if they mistakenly label it as just a black hole). You also need to consider that sometimes artists will draw things that aren't completely accurate but are meant to be visually striking. Don't let that confuse you, black holes are 3D"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is studying black holes and comes across various representations in textbooks and online resources. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the true nature of black holes and addresses common misconceptions?\n\nA) Black holes are 2-dimensional objects, as evidenced by their common depiction as flat discs in artistic renderings and diagrams.\n\nB) Black holes exist in 4 dimensions: the three spatial dimensions plus time, making them fundamentally different from other celestial bodies.\n\nC) Black holes are 3-dimensional objects with extremely high mass, often misrepresented in popular media due to the challenges in visualizing their complex nature.\n\nD) The dimensionality of black holes is undefined, as they represent singularities where the laws of physics break down completely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Black holes are indeed 3-dimensional objects, similar to other celestial bodies like planets and stars, but with extremely high mass concentrated in a small volume. This answer addresses the misconception that may arise from 2D representations in media, which are often simplified visualizations or depictions of the black hole's gravitational effects rather than the object itself. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it confuses artistic representations with reality. Answer B, while touching on the concept of spacetime, incorrectly suggests that this makes black holes fundamentally different in dimensionality from other objects. Answer D goes too far in suggesting that the dimensionality of black holes is undefined; while singularities present challenges to our understanding of physics, the black hole itself is a 3D object."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/04", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7740", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/3326/"], "docs_id": 7740, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought an iPhone 4 recently. I've been using Find my iPhone but I find it a little limited. \n\nFirst, you need to have Wi\\-Fi or 3G to be able to deactivate or send a message. That consumes a lot of battery. Second, if you have only 3G enabled (which seems to be a more viable solution), the accuracy isn't that good. I've done some tests and it has detected my phone 100m away from where I am. And finally, if none of those are on, you can't lock your phone with a password, otherwise whoever has it won't be able to turn Wi\\-Fi or 3G on.\n\nA friend who uses Android told me about [LostPhone](http://www.appbrain.com/app/lost-phone/com.gadgetprojects.lostphone), which is capable of doing all the lock and alert functions by SMS too. I dug a bit and found FoneHome and TapTrace, but none of them seem to be SMS capable.\n\nDoes anyone know a solution to this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Try to to go `/Library/Preferences/` and search for `com.apple.windowserver.plist`. It's the file that gets updated when you modify the display in `System Preferences` (I just tried).\n\nAccording to [**this Apple KB**](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2084), it's safe to delete it. So move it on your desktop and try to reboot."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with their Mac's display settings and suspects a problem with the system preferences. Which of the following steps would be most appropriate to troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA) Delete the entire /Library/Preferences/ folder and restart the computer\nB) Locate and delete the com.apple.finder.plist file, then restart\nC) Find the com.apple.windowserver.plist file, move it to the desktop, and reboot\nD) Reinstall macOS to reset all system preferences\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct approach is to locate the com.apple.windowserver.plist file in the /Library/Preferences/ directory, move it to the desktop (which effectively removes it from its original location), and then reboot the computer. This file is updated when display settings are modified in System Preferences, and according to Apple's knowledge base, it's safe to delete. By moving it and rebooting, you allow the system to regenerate the file with default settings, which can often resolve display-related issues without the need for more drastic measures.\n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially harmful, as deleting the entire Preferences folder would affect many system and application settings.\nOption B targets the wrong plist file, as Finder settings are not related to display issues.\nOption D is an extreme measure that's unnecessary for this type of problem and would be time-consuming."}}
