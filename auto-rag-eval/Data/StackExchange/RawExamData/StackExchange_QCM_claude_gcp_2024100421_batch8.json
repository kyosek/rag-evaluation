The first way involves the electron cloud oscillating with the photon but emit it again without permanently absorbing it. The other way involves the electron cloud oscillating at around its resonant frequency, which causes the absorption of photons to excite the electron cloud to higher energy states. But from my understanding of quantum mechanics, energy levels should be discrete, why would a range of photons be able to cause the elctron clouds to resonate and then excite them to different degrees? Also, is emission lines only produced by ions and would be irrelevant here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let us first try to understand why we must get peaks in our spectra. Considered for simplicity, transitions between $3$ energy levels. Now if the energy levels are sharply defined, then we expect to see three peaks in our spectra, not because there are $3$ levels but because there are $3$ unique pairs that can be formed ($^3C\\_2\\=3$).[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQSnn.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQSnn.jpg)The height of the spectra depends on how strongly the energy levels in question couple with the electromagnetic field. \n\nIn gases, the energy levels are usually sharply defined. But still the spectra is not completely discrete. One of the main reasons is Doppler effect. Due to the motion of the atoms, they see a Doppler shifted frequency of the incoming light. This means they absorb light of \u201cwrong\u201d frequency. And since the atoms in general have a velocity distribution, this translates to a distribution in the resonant frequency. This causes a broadening in the spectra(which can be reduced by lowering the temperature). \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EKf7.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EKf7.jpg)\n\nComing to solids, the energy levels are not sharp to begin with. They are broad in general. Thus there is a continuous range of transition that can be made. \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZS3U.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZS3U.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In spectroscopy, what phenomenon primarily contributes to the broadening of spectral lines in gases, even though their energy levels are typically sharply defined?\n\nA) Resonant frequency absorption\nB) Doppler effect\nC) Continuous energy bands\nD) Electron cloud oscillation\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Doppler effect is the primary cause of spectral line broadening in gases. Due to the motion of atoms, they perceive incoming light at slightly shifted frequencies. This results in absorption of light at frequencies that deviate from the exact resonant frequency, creating a distribution of absorbed frequencies. This distribution corresponds to the velocity distribution of the atoms in the gas, leading to broader spectral lines rather than perfectly sharp peaks. \n\nOption A is incorrect because resonant frequency absorption would lead to sharp spectral lines, not broadening. \nOption C is more characteristic of solids, not gases. \nOption D, while related to light absorption, doesn't directly explain the broadening of spectral lines in gases.\n\nThis question tests understanding of spectral line broadening mechanisms and distinguishes between characteristics of spectra in gases versus solids."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/01/22", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/687436", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/87918/"], "docs_id": 687436, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can ping *google.com* for several seconds and when I press `Ctrl` \\+ `C`, a brief summary is displayed at the bottom:\n\n```\n$ ping google.com\nPING google.com (74.125.131.113) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=46.7 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=45.0 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=4 ttl=56 time=54.5 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 3 received, 25% packet loss, time 3009ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 44.965/48.719/54.524/4.163 ms\n\n```\n\nHowever, when I do the same redirecting output to log file with `tee`, the summary is not displayed:\n\n```\n$ ping google.com | tee log\nPING google.com (74.125.131.113) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=34.1 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=57.0 ms\n64 bytes from lu-in-f113.1e100.net (74.125.131.113): icmp_seq=3 ttl=57 time=50.9 ms\n^C\n\n```\n\nCan I get the summary as well when redirecting output with `tee`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `ping` shows the summary when it is killed with `SIGINT`, *e.g.* as a result of `Ctrl``C`, or when it has transmitted the requested number of packets (the `-c` option). `Ctrl``C` causes `SIGINT` to be sent to all processes in the foreground process group, *i.e.* in this scenario all the processes in the pipeline (`ping` and `tee`). `tee` doesn\u2019t catch `SIGINT` (on Linux, look at `SigCgt` in `/proc/$(pgrep tee)/status`), so when it receives the signal, it dies, closing its end of the pipe.

The `tee` command doesn't catch SIGINT, so it terminates immediately, closing its end of the pipe. This creates a race condition where `ping` may either die from SIGPIPE before receiving SIGINT, or attempt to output its summary but fail due to the closed pipe.

The textbook says to discard the $dm\\_g dv$ term, so we have \n\n$$m\\\\,dv \\= \\- u\\\\,dm \\\\tag{2}$$\n\nTaking $m$ as a a function of time, we can then solve for $\\\\Delta v$:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\n\\\\int\\_{v\\_0}^{v\\_1} dv \\&\\= \\-u \\\\int\\_{m\\_0}^{m\\_1} \\\\frac{dm}{m} \\\\\\\\\nv\\_1 \\- v\\_0 \\= \\\\Delta v \\&\\= u \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\_0}{m\\_1}\\\\right)\n\\\\end{align}$$\n\nwhere $m\\_1$ is the final mass of the rocket after expelling $\\-\\\\Delta m$ units of fuel.\n\n**My question** has to do with the connection between (1\\) and (2\\). On the left side of (2\\), we have $m\\\\, dv$, which derives from the expression $(m\\-dm\\_g)(v\\+dv)$ in (1\\). In this expression, $m$ represents the *initial* mass of the rocket\\-fuel system (hence we subtract $dm\\_g$ to get the instantaneous mass). Likewise, in (2\\) it seems to me like $m$ should refer to the rocket's initial mass $m\\_0$, not its changing mass as a function of time. \n\nThen (2\\) instead reads\n\n$$m\\_0\\\\,dv \\= \\- u\\\\,dm \\\\tag{2}$$\n\nand simply\n\n$$\\\\Delta v \\= \\-u \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\_1 \\- m\\_0}{m\\_0}\\\\right)$$\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nI'd prefer answers that clarify the proof in question, rather than providing alternative proofs from Newton's law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since your main confusion is around mass as a function of time, let's explicitly add the label of time from the beginning to be clear as to what we are talking about explicitly. \n\nYou have $p\\_i\\=p\\_f$. What this really refers to is $p\\_t\\=p\\_{t\\+dt}$. Carrying these labels of time, let's redo the calculation that your textbook does. \n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\nm\\_tv\\_t\\&\\={(m\\_t\\-dm\\_{g,t})}{(v\\_t\\+dv\\_t)}\\+dm\\_{g,t}(v\\_t\\-u)\\\\tag{1}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}$$\nNotice that I have eliminated any and all use of $t\\+dt$ from the labeling and expressed everything with a label of $t$. This is justified and necessary: The $dm\\_g$ is the mass ejected at time $t$ which causes the mass of the rocket at time $t\\+dt$ to be $m\\_{t\\+dt}\\=m\\_t\\-dm\\_{g,t}$. Similarly, the increase in speed $dv$ is at time $t$, leading to the new speed $v\\_{t\\+dt}\\=v\\_t\\+dv\\_t$. \n\nGranted, talking about \"increase at time $t$\" is a loose way of speaking, but if I want to be properly rigorous, I'd need to start talking in terms of time\\-derivatives and this would amount to simply using Newton's law which you have forbidden me from doing :) But I hope the intuitive meaning of my labeling makes sense. \n\nLet's carry out the rest of the calculation in this labeling. However, we don't really need to do that explicitly because all the symbols have the same label $t$ and so we can just add this label to the end result which we know from the calculation in your textbook. You can explicitly perform the calculations with the labels starting from Equation $\\\\text{(1\\)}$ and confirm that it leads to  \n\n$$\\\\begin{align}\nm\\_t\\\\,dv\\_t \\&\\=dm\\_{g,t}\\\\,dv\\_t\\+dm\\_{g,t}\\\\,u\\\\\\\\\n\\\\implies m\\_t\\\\,dv\\_t\\&\\=\\-dm\\_t\\\\,u \\\\tag{2}\n\\\\end{align}$$\nHere, it is explicitly clear that $m\\_t$ *is* the mass at time $t$. But let's understand this better. The answer doesn't lie in the trick I did with the $t$ labels, that just magnifies the point but doesn't create it. The point is that when you write $m\\\\,dv\\=\\-dm\\\\,u$, you're right that $m$ doesn't represent the final mass, it represents the initial mass, but that's not an issue, in fact, it is desired. You have to see this relation as an equation for $dm$ and $dv$. In other words, it tells you that if you start with a mass $m$ then the differential change in the mass and the differential change in the velocity are related by the formula $m\\\\,dv\\=\\-dm\\\\,u$ where $m$ *is* the mass *before* the differential change. Now, you again start with the mass $m\\+dm$ and do the same process, ad infinitum. Or, you can do the integration. \n\n---\n\n**A Comment Regarding OP's Answer**\n\nThe term $dm\\_g\\\\,dv$ has to be ignored because it is a second\\-order differential term. Furthermore, if you keep the term then what you obtain is actually $$m\\_{t\\+dt}dv\\_t\\=\\-dm\\_tu$$which cannot be straightforwardly integrated because of the fact that all terms don't represent quantities at the same time $t$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In deriving the rocket equation, why is the term dm_g dv discarded?\n\nA) It's negligible compared to other terms in the equation\nB) It's a second-order differential term that complicates integration\nC) It violates conservation of momentum principles\nD) It leads to a circular definition of rocket velocity\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The term dm_g dv is discarded because it's a second-order differential term. Keeping this term would result in an equation of the form m_{t+dt}dv_t = -dm_t u, where not all terms represent quantities at the same time t. This makes straightforward integration of the equation difficult or impossible.

This eliminates option A and C. \n\nFurthermore, the summation should be over all 1000 rolls, not just the 20 possible outcomes.

Imidiately after loading the map these values seem to be negative for a while, this problem seems to resolve itself after a few seconds.\n\n`timer` is a timer that is used to detect if the player did NOT rotate for a while\n\n`global` holds the parameters `min`, `max`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, and `timerTime`.  \n\n`min` and `max` are used for the sectors, `min` should always be `0`, `max` is the highest value that `rotationOne` can have before rolling over to `0`. This changes if you change the number in the first command. Make sure to keep `max` updated if you decide to change the number in the first command.  \n\n`timerTime` is used by the timer and defines how long a player has to stand still until it counts as \"not moving\". A value of 20 sets the timer to 1 second.  \n\n`left`, `right`, `up`, and `down` are values assigned to each direction, I recommend using `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`. The value for \"no movement\" will always be `0`\n\nUsing these values you would initialize your scoreboards like so:\n\n```\nscoreboard objectives add rotationOne dummy\nscoreboard objectives add rotationTwo dummy\nscoreboard objectives add lastRotationOne dummy\nscoreboard objectives add lastRotationTwo dummy\nscoreboard objectives add timer dummy\nscoreboard objectives add looksLeft dummy\nscoreboard objectives add looksRight dummy\nscoreboard objectives add looksUp dummy\nscoreboard objectives add looksDown dummy\nscoreboard objectives add directionChanged dummy\nscoreboard objectives add lastDirection dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepOne dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepTwo dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepThree dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepFour dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepFive dummy\nscoreboard objectives add stepSix dummy\nscoreboard objectives add global dummy\n\nscoreboard players set min global 0\nscoreboard players set max global 12\nscoreboard players set left global 1\nscoreboard players set right global 2\nscoreboard players set up global 4\nscoreboard players set down global 8\nscoreboard players set timerTime global 50 (for 2.5 seconds)\n\n```\n\nIn the first two commands you decide the precision, a higher number at the end will require the movements to be more precise, lower numbers will require bigger movements. In the first command that means that there will be more, or less sectors in the ring. *Make sure to set `max` to the correct number if you change the first command*. The first two commands also store the current rotation of each player, which will be used later.\n\n```\nexecute as @a store result score @s rotationOne run data get entity @s Rotation[0] 0.036\nexecute as @a store result score @s rotationTwo run data get entity @s Rotation[1] 0.036\n\n```\n\nAfter that you can run the following commands. You should not have to change anything about them, though they could probably be more efficient.\n\n```\nexecute as @a unless score @s rotationOne = min global store success score @s looksLeft if score @s lastRotationOne > @s rotationOne\nexecute as @a if score @s rotationOne = min global store success score @s looksLeft unless score max global = @s lastRotationOne unless score min global = @s lastRotationOne\nexecute as @a if score @s rotationOne = max global store success score @s looksLeft if score min global = @s lastRotationOne\nexecute as @a unless score @s rotationOne = max global store success score @s looksRight if score @s lastRotationOne < @s rotationOne\nexecute as @a if score @s rotationOne = max global store success score @s looksRight unless score min global = @s lastRotationOne unless score max global = @s lastRotationOne\nexecute as @a if score @s rotationOne = min global store success score @s looksRight if score max global = @s lastRotationOne\nexecute as @a store success score @s looksUp if score @s lastRotationTwo > @s rotationTwo\nexecute as @a store success score @s looksDown if score @s lastRotationTwo < @s rotationTwo\nexecute as @a store success score @s directionChanged unless score @s rotationOne = @s lastRotationOne\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=0}] store success score @s directionChanged unless score @s rotationTwo = @s lastRotationTwo\nexecute as @a run scoreboard players operation @s lastRotationOne = @s rotationOne\nexecute as @a run scoreboard players operation @s lastRotationTwo = @s rotationTwo\nscoreboard players remove @a timer 1\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s timer = timerTime global\nexecute as @a[scores={timer=..0}] run scoreboard players set @s directionChanged 1\nexecute as @a[scores={timer=..0}] run scoreboard players operation @s timer = timerTime global\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players set @s lastDirection 0\nexecute as @a[scores={looksLeft=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s lastDirection = left global\nexecute as @a[scores={looksRight=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s lastDirection = right global\nexecute as @a[scores={looksUp=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s lastDirection = up global\nexecute as @a[scores={looksDown=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s lastDirection = down global\nexecute as @a if score @s lastDirection = @s stepFive run scoreboard players set @s directionChanged 0\n\n```\n\nTo confirm to a player, when a direction has been registered, you would use these commands:\n\n```\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1,looksLeft=1}] run msg @s left\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1,looksRight=1}] run msg @s right\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1,looksUp=1}] run msg @s up\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1,looksDown=1}] run msg @s down    \nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1,lastDirection=0}] run msg @s stopped \n\n```\n\nAt this point you should decide how many inputs you want to use for your most complicated ability and add as many as you need according to this pattern:\n\n```\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s stepOne = @s stepTwo\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s stepTwo = @s stepThree\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s stepThree = @s stepFour\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s stepFour = @s stepFive\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] run scoreboard players operation @s stepFive = @s lastDirection\n\n```\n\nAnd finally you get to make the abilities, you basically just make a long command with a lot of `if`s, one for every step that is important for activating that ability. For an ability that should activate after \"*left, right, not moving, up, down*\" you would use a command like this:\n\n```\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] if score @s stepOne = left global if score @s stepTwo = right global if score @s stepThree matches 0 if score @s stepFour = up global if score @s stepFive = down global run <abilityOne>\n\n```\n\nIf you want to add more abilities that are shorter, then you start at a higher step and ignore the first few steps, to make an ability for \"*up, down, up*\" you can use this command:\n\n```\nexecute as @a[scores={directionChanged=1}] if score @s stepThree = up global if score @s stepFour = down global if score @s stepFive = up global run <abilityTwo>\n\n```\n\nI used all of these commands in that order in a long chain of command blocks. I hope you can just copy and paste them into a function file."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of creating custom player abilities using datapacks in Minecraft, which of the following combinations correctly represents the scoreboard objectives and their purposes as described in the documentation?\n\nA) \n- rotationOne: for x rotation\n- lastRotationTwo: for y rotation\n- timer: for detecting player inactivity\n- looksUp: for detecting upward gaze\n- stepOne: for storing the most recent action\n\nB)\n- rotationTwo: for y rotation\n- lastRotationOne: for x rotation\n- directionChanged: for detecting any rotation\n- looksRight: for detecting rightward gaze\n- global: for holding parameters like min, max, left, right\n\nC)\n- rotationOne: for y rotation\n- rotationTwo: for x rotation\n- timer: for detecting player inactivity\n- looksLeft: for detecting leftward gaze\n- stepOne: for remembering the last few actions\n\nD)\n- rotationOne: for x rotation\n- lastRotationTwo: for y rotation\n- looksDown: for detecting downward gaze\n- directionChanged: for detecting any movement\n- global: for holding parameters like up, down, left, right\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately represents the scoreboard objectives and their purposes as described in the documentation.

Various solutions propose adding entries to HKCR\\\\Folder and others suggest adding entries to HKCR\\\\Directory.\n\nBased on this question ([Directory Vs. Folder](https://superuser.com/questions/169457/directory-vs-folder)) it seems a folder could be virtual or not while a directory is always \"real\". A ven diagram would have folder being a large circle and directory a smaller circle completely enclosed within the folder circle.\n\nFor the sake of a command prompt, is it correct to assume I'll probably only be dealing with \"real\" folders, or directories?\n\nThe questions then are as follows:\nCan I open a command prompt window in a virtual directory and what conceivable reason would I have for doing this?\nWould adding a context menu item ONLY to HKCR\\\\Folder cover all my bases and then some?\nWould adding a context menu item ONLY to HKCR\\\\Directory end up missing some things?\n\nFinally, for brownie points:\nWhat if I wanted to be able to add an entry to open a command prompt by clicking inside a folder rather than on a folder icon, which context menu item would I have to use to get this function?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best way I did it was add the Open command prompt to **all objects**. The open command prompt passes the working directory (cmd /k pushd %d\") and you get the command prompt on the working directory of the object you right clicked.\n\nFor the most part, you CAN open a command prompt in a virtual folder. It depends though. For example, DFS folders return a command prompt at a UNC. But trying to get a command prompt on an object in a search folder just gets you the real location of the object.\n\nEdit:\n\nTo get the command prompt when you right click the background requires that you write a shell extension. And since Microsoft **insists** shell extensions be written in native code !me :( See the MSDN on the shell extension menu.\n\n[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en\\-us/library/cc144067(v\\=vs.85\\).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144067(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nOr you could just download this program: Context Console Shell Extension.\n\n<http://code.kliu.org/cmdopen/>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to add an \"Open Command Prompt Here\" shortcut to the context menu in Windows.

Adding the shortcut to all objects ensures it will work in various contexts, including both real and virtual folders.\n\n2. Using \"cmd /k pushd %d\" as the command allows the prompt to open in the working directory of the clicked object, which is more versatile than targeting specific registry locations.\n\n3. This method works for virtual folders where possible, such as DFS folders, returning a command prompt at a UNC path.\n\n4. It avoids potential issues of missing certain folder types that might occur if only targeting HKCR\\Folder or HKCR\\Directory.\n\n5. This approach doesn't require writing a shell extension, which Microsoft requires to be in native code for adding context menu items to the folder background.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C might work in some cases, they are less comprehensive and may miss certain folder types or contexts.

In TEM modes, both the electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields must be transverse to the direction of propagation, meaning Ez=Hz=0. For TEM mode propagation, the waveguide needs to support both induced currents (for the H field) and induced voltages (for the E field) in a way that they reinforce each other. This is only possible in waveguides with two or more separate conductors, such as coaxial cables or parallel plate waveguides. In these structures, the conductors can be shaped to have the voltage and current reinforce each other, allowing for TEM mode propagation. Single conductor waveguides cannot support this arrangement, as the induced currents and voltages would cancel each other out.\n\nOption A is incorrect because TEM modes require Ez=Hz=0, not non-zero values.

To get the points into a diagonal line we would have to slide the *largest* (rightmost) times to the left (that is, pull them in towards their middle) and we would have to slide the *smallest* (leftmost) times a little to the left as well (that is, push them away from the middle time value).

In fact, the opposite is true - GeoTIFF tags can only be written when exporting from the data view, not the page layout.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The tool does not automatically maintain the aspect ratio of the data frame.

Your brain is like a muscle that way. After a period of time you'll most likely remember broad concepts but not specifics about syntax and lesser\\-used functions. For example, you may want to do a `for` loop or iterate over a list and know that it's something like `while List.hasNext()` or `for item in list` or `for index, item of list` but not writing it very confidently.\n\nThe good thing is, you'll know what you want to do. You just need to look it up. So I wouldn't be too worried about it. It'll come back to you. The important thing is to learn how to solve problems with programs. All programming languages are usually capable of doing the same things, but most of the time in different ways. You might forget that Ruby or Python have comprehensions and write too many `for` loops instead, but you'll get the job done.\n\nAs for how much you'll forget or remember, I think that kind of depends on how active your mind is and how old you are. I don't think I developed a fully functional brain until I was 19\\. At that point memorizing anything for me was a snap. Everyone is different.\n\nIn sum: details always fade, the rate they fade depends on you, all languages are trying to make it easy to solve the same problems, so maybe it's more important to learn how to solve problems. :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a novice programmer who takes frequent breaks from coding, which of the following statements best describes the long-term retention of programming knowledge?\n\nA) Programming knowledge, including syntax and language functionality, remains constant regardless of practice frequency.\n\nB) Programming skills are entirely lost after a few months without practice and must be relearned from scratch.\n\nC) Core problem-solving concepts are retained, but specific syntax and lesser-used functions may fade without regular practice.\n\nD) Programming knowledge is solely dependent on age, with younger individuals retaining information better regardless of practice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the StackExchange post, while programming knowledge can fade over time without practice, it's more akin to riding a bike or speaking a language. Core concepts and problem-solving skills tend to be retained, but specific syntax and lesser-used functions may become less readily accessible. The post emphasizes that programmers may remember broad concepts but struggle with exact syntax after periods of inactivity. However, the ability to recognize what needs to be done and look up the specific implementation details remains. This aligns with the idea that the fundamental skill of problem-solving in programming persists, even if some technical details require refreshing."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/06/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/365064", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/200898/"], "docs_id": 365064, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: After upvoting or downvoting on any post, question or answer, I can't change it.

Unsupervised learning algorithm is used to perform independent random sampling from majority class. Multiple classifiers based on the combination of each majority class subset with the minority class data are chosen.\n\nAnother example of informed undersampling uses the K\\-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to achieve undersampling. One of the [four methods on KNN](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/jzhang.pdf), looks most straightforward, called NearMiss\\-3, selects a given number of the closest majority samples for each minority sample to guarantee that every minority sample is surrounded by some majority samples. However, another method, NearMiss\\-2, in which the majority class samples are selected if their average distance to the three farthest minority class samples are the smallest, is proved the most competitive approach in imbalanced learning.\n\nThe profit (cost) matrix can be considered as a numerical representation of the penalty of classifying samples from one class to another. In decision tree, \n\n(1\\) cost\\-sensitive adjustments can be applied to the decision threshold; \n\nROC curve is applied to plot the range of performance values as the decision threshold is moved from the point where the total misclassifications on majority class are maximally costly to the point where total misclassifications on the minority class are maximally costly. The most dominant point on the ROC curve corresponds to the final decision threshold. Read [this paper](http://www.eiti.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/maloof-icml03-wids.pdf) for more details.\n\n(2\\) cost\\-sensitive considerations can be given to the split criteria at each node; \n\nThis is achieved by fitting an impurity function, and the split with maximum fitting accuracy at each node is selected. This [tutorial](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/elkan.pdf) generalizes the effects of decision tree growth for any choice of spit criteria.\n\n(3\\) cost\\-sensitive pruning schemes can be applied to the tree.\n\nPruning improves generalization by removing leaves with class probability estimates below a specified threshold. Laplace smoothing method on pruning technique is described in the same [tutorial](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/elkan.pdf) here to reduce the probability that pruning removes leaves on the minority class."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In dealing with imbalanced datasets, which of the following methods is NOT an approach for informed undersampling of the majority class?\n\nA) Using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to select majority samples closest to minority samples\nB) Applying unsupervised learning to perform independent random sampling from the majority class\nC) Selecting majority samples with the smallest average distance to the three farthest minority samples\nD) Removing all majority class samples that are not within a certain distance of minority samples\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A refers to the NearMiss-3 method, which selects the closest majority samples for each minority sample. \nOption B describes the use of unsupervised learning for independent random sampling from the majority class. \nOption C corresponds to the NearMiss-2 method, which selects majority samples based on their average distance to the farthest minority samples. \nOption D, however, is not mentioned as an informed undersampling approach in the given information.

The excitation is the voltage you put into a load cell in order to\nget an output from it.\n2. The load cell's sensitivity is the ratio of its output to its input, stated in units of \"millivolts\\[of output] per volt\"\\[of input], with the full\\-scale\nrated mechanical load on the load cell.\n\nWhat that means is that if you have a load cell rated for 1000kg full\\-scale and it exhibits a sensitivity of 2 millivolts per volt, with an excitation of 10 volts it'll put out 20 millivolts when there's 1000kg sitting on it. With 500kg sitting on it and 10 volts of excitation it'll put out 10 millivolts, as it will with 5 volts of excitation and a 1000Kg load.\n\nAnd the rest of it:\n\nIn order to build up the tiny signal from the load cell into something that makes sense to feed into an ADC, you'll need to amplify that signal. \n\nThe gain of the amplifier will be determined by the ADC's full\\-scale input requirement and the Load cell's full\\-scale output, the relationship being:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\= \\\\frac{ADC\\_{\\\\ in}}{LOAD CELL\\_{\\\\ OUT}}, $$\n\nIn the case of a load cell with a 20mV output and an ADC with a 5 volt full\\-scale input, that gain would need to be:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\=\\\\frac {5V}{0\\.02V} \\= 250 $$ \n\nNow, for the nitty\\-gritty:)\n\nAfter all of that, if everything were perfect, 1000kg sitting on the load cell would result in an output of 11 1111 1111 from the ADC and 00 0000 0000 with no load on the load cell.\n\nThat's 1024 different states representing the range from zero to 1000 kg, so that range would resolve into 1024 increments of about 976\\.56 grams each, which would be the resolution of the system. \n\nIn the instrumentation world, \"offset\" means \"zero\" and span means \"gain\", so what you'll need to do to calibrate your system, once you have it all hooked up, is to make sure there's no mechanical load on the load cell, turn on the excitation supply, crank the span control up a little until you get a reading on the ADC, and wait a while until everything gets stable. Once it does, adjust the offset pot for zero, put 1000 kg on the load cell, and adjust the span control for a reading on the ADC which reflects the resolution you want. \n\nThat is, for maximum resolution set the reading to 11 1111 1111, but if you want to resolve the reading into, say, one kilogram steps for convenience downstream, set the reading to 01 1101 1000 and the count will increase by one LSB for every kilogram added to the load. Repeat the zero and span adjustments as needed to get zero and span where you want them, and you'll be done. \u2013 EM Fields 2 mins ago edit  \n\nadd a comment"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A rocket engine testing facility is using a 1000kg load cell with a sensitivity of 2.0 mV/V to measure thrust.

This is calculated by dividing the ADC full-scale input (5V) by the load cell's full-scale output (0.02V or 20mV).\n\nPart 2: The resolution is 976.56g. With a 10-bit ADC, there are 1024 discrete levels. Dividing the full scale (1000kg) by 1024 gives 976.56g per level.\n\nPart 3: For maximum resolution, the ADC should read 11 1111 1111 (1023 in decimal) when 1000kg is applied, utilizing the full range of the ADC.\n\nPart 4: To resolve into 1kg steps, the reading should be 01 1101 1000 (472 in decimal) when 1000kg is applied.

Even if there's no actual structure in the data, the clustering will impose one by grouping together points which are nearby. This shrinks the within\\-group variance and grows the across\\-group variance, which biases you towards false positives.\n\nThis effect is surprisingly strong. Here are the results of a [simulation](https://gist.github.com/mrkrause/2b315222abd00c902a1d) that draws a 1000 data points from a standard normal distribution. If we assign the points to one of five groups at random before running the ANOVA, we find that the p\\-values are uniformly distributed: 5% of the runs are significant at the (uncorrected) 0\\.05 level, 1% at the 0\\.01 level, etc. In other words, there is no effect. However, if $k$\\-means is used to cluster the data into 5 groups, we find a significant effect virtually every time, *even though the data has no actual structure*.\n\n![Simulation results showing a uniform distribution of pvalues for the random assignments and a highly skewed (almost all 0.05 or less) distribution of p values after clustering](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LO8AF.png)\n\nThere is nothing special about a k\\-means or an ANOVA here\\-\\-you would see similar effects using non\\-parametric tests or logistic regression and a decision tree, even just taking the min/max.\n\nAfter you impose some kind of structure on the data, you cannot to test whether some structure exists, since it obvious does!. As a result, validating clustering algorithms' performance is tricky, particularly if the data are not labelled. However, there are a few approaches to \"internal validation\", or measuring the clusters' quality without using external data sources.

Using ANOVA or similar statistical tests on the same data used for clustering is not a valid approach for cluster validation and is likely to result in false positives. This is because the clustering process itself imposes structure on the data by grouping similar points together, which artificially reduces within-group variance and increases between-group variance.

Option B is wrong because simply switching to a non-parametric test like Kruskal-Wallis doesn't solve the fundamental issue of using the same data for clustering and validation.

When we round $z$ to $d\\\\ge 0$ digits we are rounding the value $10^d z$ to the nearest integer and then multiplying the result by $10^{\\-d}.$ Thus we may focus on the process of rounding numbers $z$ to the nearest integer. *For this post alone,* let $\\[z]$ designate the result of rounding to an integer. (This is a conventional notation for discussions of rounding.)\n2. The nearest integers to $z$ are its floor $\\\\lfloor z \\\\rfloor$ and its ceiling $\\\\lceil z \\\\rceil,$ for which $\\\\lfloor z \\\\rfloor \\\\le z \\\\le \\\\lceil z \\\\rceil.$\n\n\t* When one of these integers is closest to $z,$ it is the rounded version of $z.$ In particular, the distance between $z$ and its rounded version cannot exceed $1/2:$ $\\|\\\\,z \\- \\[z]\\\\,\\| \\\\le 1/2\\.$\n\t* When $z$ lies equidistant from its floor and ceiling, it is an odd multiple of $1/2\\.$ Many systems \\-\\- `R` is one of them \\-\\- round to an *even* value (multiple of $2$) in those circumstances. Thus, $\\[1/2] \\= 0,$ $\\[3/2] \\= 2,$ $\\[5/2] \\= 2,$ $\\[7/2]\\=4,$ and so on. See, for instance, this `R` command and its output:\n\n\t```\n\t> round(seq(1/2, 7/2, by=1))\n\t[1] 0 2 2 4\n\n\t```\n\n**Our objective is to infer plausible values of the $a\\_i$ and $N$ from the data.** This requires us (somehow) to invert the rounding process. To that end, it is helpful to note (from the foregoing description of rounding) that\n\n* $\\|a\\_i/N \\- x\\_i\\|\\\\,10^d \\= \\|10^d (z\\_i \\- x\\_i)\\| \\\\le 1/2,$ whence $$x\\_iN \\- \\\\left(\\\\frac{10^{\\-d}}{2}\\\\right)N \\\\le a\\_i \\\\le x\\_iN \\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{10^{\\-d}}{2}\\\\right)N.\\\\tag{\\*}$$\n* When $\\|10^d a\\_i/N \\- 10^d x\\_i\\| \\= 1/2,$ then $10^dx\\_i$ is a multiple of $2\\.$ This refines $(\\*)$ by indicating which of those inequalities are strict ones. One way to rephrase this is to consider whether $10^d x\\_i$ (which must be integral) is odd or even. When it is even, it is possible for the first inequality to be equality; when it is odd, it is possible for the second inequality to be equality.\n\n**The original question arises in circumstances where the $x\\_i$ do not sum to unity.**\n\nAs an example, consider $(a\\_1,a\\_2,a\\_3,a\\_4\\)\\=(1,1,5,9\\).$ Here $N\\=1\\+1\\+5\\+9\\=16$ and, using $d\\=3$ digits, the fractions round to $\\[1/16]\\=0\\.062,$ $\\[5/16]\\=0\\.312,$ and $\\[9/16]\\=0\\.562,$ which sum to $0\\.998 \\= 1 \\- 2\\\\times 10^{\\-d}.$ In particular, this example shows that the sum of the rounded values may differ from $1$ by as much as $n$ times the maximum rounding error of $10^{\\-d}/2\\.$\n\nIn such cases, **we would like to infer the integers $a\\_i$ so that we may recover more accurate versions of the $z\\_i$ from the data.** Note, though, that any solution $(a\\_i)$ automatically gives rise to a host of solutions of the form $(ma\\_i)$ for any multiple $m\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots.$ There may be other solutions, too, which are not multiples of this one. How to choose among them? I propose the following, which arises from an application of Occam's Razor (viewing smaller denominators as \"simpler\"):\n\n> To solve this problem, first specify an allowable range of values for $N,$ say from $N\\_0$ to $N\\_1,$ inclusive. Among all possible solutions $(a\\_i),$ write $N\\=\\\\sum a\\_i$ and *select the solution for which $N\\_0 \\\\le N \\\\le N\\_1$ and $N$ is as small as possible.*\n\n### An Algorithm\n\nLet $N \\\\ge 1$ be any candidate for the sum of the $a\\_i.$ When it is the correct (original) value, $(\\*)$ must hold for every $x\\_i.$ This pair of inequalities defines a (possibly empty) set $\\\\mathcal{A}(x\\_i;N)$ of integers $a\\_i$ that satisfy them. Ordinarily (for $N$ sufficiently small) these sets are empty or contain just one element. It therefore is feasible and efficient to consider all tuples $(a\\_1,\\\\ldots,a\\_n)$ for which *both* $a\\_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}(x\\_i;N)$ for all $i$ *and* $a\\_1\\+\\\\cdots\\+a\\_n\\=N.$ If rounding these $a\\_i/N$ to $d$ digits *exactly* reproduces the data $(x\\_i),$ we have a solution. Let the set of all such solutions (usually empty) be $\\\\mathcal{S}(N).$\n\nThe algorithm is now simple to describe. I will use pseudocode:\n\n```\nInput: Array x, integers N0, N1, and digit count d\nn = length(x)\nFor N from N0 to N1:\n    For each i from 1 to n:\n        Let A[i] = A(x[i],N)\n    If U (in the next step) will be too large then stop\n    Let U = A[1] X A[2] X ... X A[n] {the Cartesian product}\n    Let S = Empty collection\n    For each array a in U:\n         If sum(a) == N and round(a/N, d) == x then adjoin a to S\n Return S.\n\n```\n\nThe output is a set (usually empty or a singleton) of plausible solutions.\n\n### Comments\n\nNotice there is no test related to rounding to even values. Omitting this test will occasionally cause the search set `U` to be too large, at some cost in computation time. But since a solution is returned only when it checks out \\-\\- it must round *exactly* to the given data `x` \\-\\- the algorithm remains correct. This implies this algorithm will work regardless of what form of rounding the software platform supports, *provided it is the same form used to create the data in the first place.*\n\nWhen $N\\_0$ is not too large, most of the time the search set `U` will be very small, making the algorithm efficient. **But note the risk:** when many of the $x\\_i$ have more than one candidate for $a\\_i,$ the size of $U$ explodes. With $n\\=60$ data values and just two candidates per value, for instance, $U$ has $2^{60}$ elements. That's why we need to check the size of $U$ before going on. Limiting the upper search limit $N\\_1$ to a sufficiently small value avoids this problem. If you cannot find any solutions, then increase $N\\_1$ and try again.\n\nIf the number of digits used for the original rounding was crude \\-\\- that is, it loses a lot of precision \\-\\- then this method will usually return a solution with a smaller value of $N$ than the original. But when $d$ is reasonably large; say, when $10^{\\-d}N \\\\approx 1$ (or less), then it will almost always return the original value of $N.$ The notable exceptions are when the greatest common divisor of the $a\\_i$ is greater than $1,$ for then there is no way to distinguish the original $a\\_i$ from $a\\_i/\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a),$ no matter how precise the rounding might be.\n\n### Examples and Code\n\nThe question asks about datasets of $60$ or fewer numbers and intimates they are rounded to $\\\\pm0\\.05\\\\%,$ which is $d\\=3$ decimal digits. That rounding precision would be unsuitable for numbers of three or more digits. Let us, then, create a dataset of integers $z\\_i$ between $0$ and $999$ (perhaps favoring the smaller ones, since rounding them can create more relative imprecision), round them to form the $x\\_i,$ and see what solution(s) this algorithm produces.\n\nThe dataset processed in this example is $(a\\_i) \\= (1,2,4,5,6,\\\\ldots, 206,238\\),$ whose sum is $N\\=4490\\.$ I conducted the search starting at $N\\_0\\=1$ (and limiting it, if needed, to $2\\\\times 10^d,$ which should be more than enough). The solution found is $N^{\\*}\\=1004,$ thereby estimating the original data as $a\\_i^{\\*} \\= (0,0,1,1,1,\\\\ldots, 46,54\\).$ However, as promised, this solution *exactly* reproduces the rounded values of $a\\_i/N.$\n\nOne way to compare the original with the solution is to plot the relative errors between the *true* ratios $a\\_i/N$ and the estimated ratios $a\\_i^{\\*}/N^{\\*}.$\n\n[![Figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1PTN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1PTN.png)\n\nAs one would expect, *rounding afflicts the *relative* precision of the smallest values the most.* This is one reason we might want to work a little bit to recover the original ratios as accurately as we reasonably can.\n\nHere's the `R` code implementing the algorithm and the data generation process to test it.\n\n```R\n#\n# Determine whether a denominator `N` will yield a solution when `x` has been\n# rounded to `digits` digits (base 10).\n#\ntest <- function(N, x, digits=2, maxsols=2^10 * length(x)) {\n  da <- 10^(-digits)/2 * N\n  xn <- x * N\n  l <- ceiling(xn - da) # Lower limits\n  u <- floor(xn + da)   # Upper limits\n  ranges <- lapply(seq_along(l), function(i) l[i]-1 + seq_len(u[i]-l[i]+1))\n  nsols <- prod(unlist(lapply(ranges, length)))\n  if (nsols <= maxsols) {\n    A <- as.matrix(do.call(expand.grid, ranges)) # Cartesian product of intervals\n    A <- A[rowSums(A) == N, , drop=FALSE]        # Enforce the sum-to-N condition\n    i <- apply(A, 1, function(a) all(round(a/N, digits)==x))\n    A[i, , drop=FALSE]    # Return all solutions that work as rows of `A`\n  } else {\n    warning(\"Too many solutions to check (\", nsols, \") for N = \", N, \".\")\n    matrix(0, 0, length(x))\n  }\n}\n#\n# Create a dataset.\n#\ndigits <- 3 # E.g., 3 digits means rounding percents to 1 digit.\nn <- 60                               # Dataset size\nsize <- 1e3                           # Maximum value of any a[i].\np <- rev(sort(runif(size)))^10 + 1e-6 # Choose smaller values preferentially\np <- p / sum(p)                       # Probabilities of 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nset.seed(17)\na <- sort(sample.int(size, n, replace=TRUE, prob=p))-1 # (Sorting is optional)\nx <- round(a / sum(a), digits)        # The data\n2 * 10^digits * abs(1 - sum(x))       # Total rounding error.\n#\n# Find solutions.\n#\nN0 <- 1             # Smallest denominator to search for\nN1 <- 2*10^digits   # Largest denominator ...\nsystem.time( {\n  solution <- matrix(0, 0, length(x))\n  for (N in seq(N0, N1)) {\n    solution <- test(N, x, digits)\n    if (nrow(solution) > 0) break # Stop at smallest `N` with a solution\n  }\n})\nif (nrow(solution) > 0) \n    rownames(solution) <- paste(\"Solution\", seq_len(nrow(solution)))\n#\n# Compare the original values `a` to the solution(s).\n#\n(rbind(a, solution))\n#\n# If the original values `a` are not recovered, demonstrate that nevertheless\n# they lead to the same values of `x`.\n#\nif(!any(sum(a) == rowSums(solution))) {\n  x.star <- round(solution / sum(solution), digits)\n  print(rbind(x=x, solution=x.star))\n}\n#\n# Visually compare `a` to the solution(s), \n# adjusting for the possibility of different `N`.\n#\nif (nrow(solution) > 0) {\n  sapply(rownames(solution), function(sname) {\n    s <- solution[sname, ]\n    subtitle <- if(min(a)==0) \"(Errors for a=0 not computable)\" else \"\"\n    plot(a, sum(a) / sum(s) * s/a, type=\"n\",\n         ylab=\"a/s\",\n         sub=subtitle,\n         main=paste(\"Relative errors for\", sname))\n    abline(h=1)\n    points(a, sum(a) / sum(s) * s/a, pch=21, bg=\"#00000030\")\n  })\n} else {\n  warning(\"No solution found.

This method, described in detail in the documentation, is specifically designed to handle the problem of recovering original integer values from rounded percentages.\n\nOption A (linear regression) is not appropriate because this is not a predictive modeling problem, but rather a problem of inverting a rounding process.\n\nOption B (quadratic programming) was mentioned in the documentation as a possibility, but it was not the recommended approach. It doesn't take into account the integer nature of the original values.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because it aligns with the algorithm described in the documentation. This method searches for the smallest denominator N that produces integer numerators (a_i) which, when rounded, exactly match the given percentages (x_i).\n\nOption D (maximum likelihood estimation) is a statistical inference method that's not particularly suited to this problem, which is more deterministic in nature.\n\nThe linear search method (Option C) is most appropriate because it directly addresses the problem of finding the simplest (smallest denominator) solution that exactly reproduces the rounded percentages, taking into account the integer nature of the original values."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/03", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/836091", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/37222/"], "docs_id": 836091, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This morning I upgraded my PHP version to 7\\.1 and am seeing an issue when cron tries to run `php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run` (a simple PHP command) I see the output:\n\n```\n3/3/2017 10:39:00 AMcrond: can't set groups: Operation not permitted\n3/3/2017 10:39:00 AMcrond: USER www-data pid 1562 cmd php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run\n3/3/2017 10:40:00 AMcrond: can't set groups: Operation not permitted\n3/3/2017 10:40:00 AMcrond: USER www-data pid 1563 cmd php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run\n3/3/2017 10:41:00 AMcrond: can't set groups: Operation not permitted\n3/3/2017 10:41:00 AMcrond: USER www-data pid 1564 cmd php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run\n3/3/2017 10:42:00 AMcrond: can't set groups: Operation not permitted\n3/3/2017 10:42:00 AMcrond: USER www-data pid 1565 cmd php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run\n3/3/2017 10:43:00 AMcrond: can't set groups: Operation not permitted\n3/3/2017 10:43:00 AMcrond: USER www-data pid 1566 cmd php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:run\n\n```\n\nThe command being run is a Laravel artisan command.

For example, the branch does not conflict with master, but it does with develop: where to resolve them? Do we need two distinct branches so that master doesn't receive the conflict resolutions that were needed for develop?\n\nIMO, that \"hotfix\" flow should be an exception scenario. In other words, ideally it shouldn't happen very often. I guess it's preferable to release another \"official\" version, containing only major bug fixes if necessary, rather than performing fixes and immediately putting them back in the production branch (master).\n\nHowever, if you're following exactly this hotfix scenario, I think that you should indeed create one pull request targeting *master* (without closing your hotfix branch), and after this merge happens (with your team reviewing the PR, and on which most likely there won't be any conflicts since there aren't parallel people committing stuff to master branch), you create a second PR targeting *develop*, solving your conflicts on the hotfix branch, if necessary (this time, closing the source \"hotfix\" branch).\n\n> Boss level: a hotfix branch when a release branch is ongoing. Does this case need three PRs: to master, develop and the release branch?\n\nIn this scenario, **in my opinion** (based on the \"*Bugfixes may be continuously merged back into develop*\" part from the diagram), you should merge the hotfix to the *release* branch, because it will eventually be merged back into develop, and it already should contain only bugfixes (the hotfix is nothing but a fix performed on production)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Git workflow using feature, release, and hotfix branches, you need to apply a critical hotfix while a release branch is ongoing. What is the most appropriate way to handle this situation according to the described branching model?\n\nA) Create a single PR from the hotfix branch to master, then manually apply the changes to develop and the release branch.\n\nB) Create three separate PRs: one to master, one to develop, and one to the release branch, resolving conflicts independently in each.\n\nC) Create a PR from the hotfix branch to master, merge it, then create a second PR to the release branch, and finally let the release branch carry the changes to develop when it's merged.\n\nD) Create a PR from the hotfix branch directly to develop, and then cherry-pick the changes to master and the release branch.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the branching model described and illustrated in the diagram, the most appropriate approach is to first merge the hotfix into master via a PR, as hotfixes are meant to address critical issues in the production code. Then, a second PR should be created to merge the hotfix into the ongoing release branch. This approach ensures that the fix is immediately applied to the production code (master) and will be included in the upcoming release. The release branch will eventually be merged back into develop, carrying the hotfix with it. This method maintains the integrity of the branching model and ensures that the fix propagates correctly through all relevant branches without unnecessary complexity or deviation from the established workflow."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/12", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/167697", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/63056/"], "docs_id": 167697, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been pretty unlucky with Hearthstone boosters: 30 packs in and still no class\\-defining legendary, rare or epic to really build a collection around. I have, however, generated several hundred dust which I'm itching to spend on something.\n\nSo the question is: given that you don't know what's going to be in the next booster, is there an \"optimal\" approach to spending your dust?\n\nA lot of sites seem to suggest that you should burn it on the most useful common cards, the ones that you need to get decks working, on the basis that they're cheap. But that seems bad advice to me because the chances of you getting what you need from boosters is quite high. After 30, I've got at least one of all the most desirable common cards, and two of many.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is the idea that you should save them up for the most powerful legendaries. On the one hand, the chances of you getting a real killer legendary from opening packs is very slim. But on the other, you need to accumulate a vast amount of dust and there is the awful chance of you aquiring a second and totally useless copy of the card.\n\nAt the moment I'm edging on using it to buy rares. They don't break the bank, and if you just buy one, acquiring a second through pack opening is actually pretty handy. \n\nBut this is just finger in the wind opinion. Is there a more rigorous way of looking at things?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An answer to your question depends on what you are trying to get out of the game.\n\n**Collecting all of the Cards!**\n--------------------------------\n\nAccording to the [Economy of Hearthstone](http://iam.yellingontheinternet.com/2013/10/10/from-dust-to-dust-the-economy-of-hearthstone/), in order to collect all of the cards, you should save all of your dust until you have enough to craft the cards you have missing. This article simulates optimal dust usage to calculate the total number of packs you would need on average to collect all of the cards.\n\n**Creating the Best Deck**\n--------------------------\n\nCreating an excellent deck does not require a lot of dust or legendary cards. Trump was able to get to the Legendary rank very quickly without spending any money\\-\\-you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mi2fhKDXk8&list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjoySmy-oP2xp5e0tbOB2Jz). In this series he spends his dust on several commons, a few rares, and a single epic (if I remember correctly).\nMost of the top players have a few legendaries in their decks, but it is not required.\nDecide on a deck you want to create and spend your dust getting those cards. The optimal way to spend dust to create a particular deck as fast as you can is to save up your dust until you can craft the rest of the deck.\n\n**Creating a Decent Ranked Deck**\n---------------------------------\n\nPerhaps you just want to play ranked and \"rank\\-up\" relatively quickly. The best way to do this is not to attempt to build the *best deck* which lots of rare cards, but to build a good deck with strong cards.\n\n1. First, decide on a deck strategy that relies mostly on rares and commons. 90% or so of your deck will be made of these, so they have to work on their own with support from epics and legendaries.\n2. Second, fill out the deck with cards that you already have that would work well in your dream deck.\n3. Third, fill the rest of the deck with cards you already have that may not be your ideal picks, but are at least good.\n4. Fourth, play with your not ideal deck. For optimal dust usage, you want to determine what is missing from your deck and this is best done through experience rather than theory\\-crafting.\n5. Spend your dust on the cards your play experience dictates would be the best additions. If you can't afford all of your ideal cards, spend your dust getting *the largest number* of ideal cards you can. This is an optimal use of your dust because it gets your deck as close as possible to your ideal deck."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Hearthstone information:\n\nQuestion: A new Hearthstone player has accumulated 800 dust and wants to improve their deck for ranked play.

A circle is a special case of an ellipse. An ellipse is a bound orbit while the other two are unbound.\n\nYour derivation assumes a circular orbit. However a perturbed circular orbit doesn't become hyperbolic \\- it becomes elliptical. In other words, if you take an object that's currently moving in a circle and get it to move a little faster, it doesn't shift to a hyperbolic orbit. It's *still bound* to the host. \n\nThe escape velocity is the minimum velocity needed for the object to become unbound.

It is fine if they stay at the same lines after I add new headings and update the table:\n\n```\nTable of Contents\nTopic Aaa\nHeading_1...........1\nHeading_2...........2\nTopic Bbb\nNew_Heading_1.......3\nHeading_3...........4\nTopic Ccc\nNew_Heading_2.......5\nHeading_4...........6\nHeading_5...........7\nHeading_6...........8\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's both, in a way.\n\nAlthough the terminal has its own \"scrollback\" (which you can access with mouse or scrollbar), full\\-screen programs \u2013 including pagers like 'less' \u2013 deliberately disable it while running (they enable the so\\-called *alternate screen* mode for full\\-screen operation), because they wouldn't have enough control over the terminal's scrollback. So instead the terminal\\-level scrolling is disabled in this mode, and all scrolling/paging is done custom by 'less'.\n\n(In a sense, this is the *whole point* of using an in\\-terminal pager, instead of just dumping the whole text to terminal and scrolling it at terminal level. By doing scrolling internally, 'less' can start at the top of the file and let you scroll *down,* instead of always ending up at the bottom.)\n\nYour main problem is that the 'less' pager simply doesn't have mouse support. (Terminal programs *can* request to directly receive mouse input1 \u2013 e.g. you will find native mouse scroll\\-wheel support in Vim or Elinks or WeeChat \u2013 but the 'less' pager does not do this.)\n\nOn a full Ubuntu environment, when you're somehow able to scroll with the wheel inside 'less', that's actually the terminal translating wheel events to fake Up/Down arrow keypresses \u2013 GNOME Terminal always does this when the alternate\\-screen mode is active, if the app hasn't activated direct mouse input.\n\n(As a practical example, if you manually ask the terminal to switch to altscreen mode with `tput smcup`, and if you're using GNOME Terminal, then the mouse wheel will begin scrolling through your shell history. `tput rmcup` gets you back.)\n\nSo the secondary problem is that Windows Terminal doesn't provide wheel event emulation, either. It *does* support sending real wheel events to mouse\\-supporting programs (again, you can wheel\\-scroll in Vim while using Windows Terminal), but wheel\\-to\\-arrows is mostly unique to GNOME Terminal and other vte\\-based terminals.\n\nYour options are:\n\n* Open a feature request at <https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/> for the scroll emulation feature (if there isn't one already).\n* Use a pager with native mouse\\-event support (e.g. `PAGER=elinks` or `vimpager` to use Vim as a pager).\n* Use GNOME Terminal (or another vte\\-based terminal) through WSLg or X11 instead of Windows Terminal.\n* Don't use a pager at all, relying on the terminal's scrollback.\n\n---\n\n1 However, due to the way terminal APIs work in Windows, SSH is not 100% transparent (e.g. ssh.exe has to deliberately request \"Unix\\-like terminal\" mode rather than legacy \"WinNT console\" mode), and importantly here, older versions of OpenSSH for Windows (7\\.4p1, I think) were [unable to](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1158) relay *any* mouse events to the remote side. This has since been fixed \u2013 if you're at least on Windows 20H2 and have OpenSSH 8\\.1p1 or newer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of terminal-based pagers like 'less', which of the following statements is correct regarding scrolling behavior and mouse support?\n\nA) The terminal's native scrollback is always available when using pagers like 'less', allowing users to scroll freely through the entire document.\n\nB) 'less' inherently supports mouse wheel scrolling on all terminal emulators, including Windows Terminal.\n\nC) Full-screen programs like 'less' disable the terminal's scrollback and implement their own scrolling mechanism, often lacking native mouse support.\n\nD) GNOME Terminal and Windows Terminal handle mouse wheel events identically when running programs in alternate screen mode.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Full-screen programs like 'less' deliberately disable the terminal's native scrollback by enabling the alternate screen mode. This allows them to have complete control over the display and implement their own scrolling mechanism. However, 'less' typically doesn't have native mouse support.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the terminal's native scrollback is disabled when using full-screen pagers like 'less'.\n\nOption B is false because 'less' does not inherently support mouse wheel scrolling. Its behavior depends on the terminal emulator being used.\n\nOption D is incorrect because GNOME Terminal and Windows Terminal handle mouse wheel events differently in alternate screen mode. GNOME Terminal translates wheel events to fake Up/Down arrow keypresses, while Windows Terminal does not provide this wheel event emulation.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the key aspects of how pagers like 'less' operate in terms of scrolling and their typical lack of native mouse support, which is central to understanding the behavior described in the original text."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/17", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/195297", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/88544/"], "docs_id": 195297, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been trying to wrap my head around MVC pattern for about 6 months.I've read tons of articles, Q\\&A, and blog posts about MVC and HMVC patterns, but I just simply don't get it 100%.\n\nI tried learning MVC by exercising one of widely used PHP MVC framework, CodeIgniter. I've implemented few internal websites for my company with it. And STILL, I don't 100% get it. I believe one of the best ways to learn something is to follow strictly defined rules.\n\n**So my question is:** What is the most strict PHP framework in terms of how MVC pattern is implemented? One that defines how I use models, controllers, and views so that I can completely get what MVC is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Short answer\n\nThere is no such thing.\n\n### Longer version:\n\nFrameworks do not implement MVC or MVC\\-inspired design pattern. Your application does.\n\nMVC is not some magic sauce, that you can add to your application by dumping it in a framework. Instead, you would actually have to learn and understand said pattern *(and the accompanying principles and practices, like [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [LoD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter), [SoC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_Concerns))*. Only then you can try to use it within your choice of a framework.\n\nIf a framework advertises that it *\"has MVC\"*, then it is completely utter *dren*. In that situation, it is used to \"sell\" the framework to the noobs that care more about the latest hype then about application design and coding practices.\n\nThe goal of a framework would be to provide you collection of tools, that, when used as whole, provide you with an altered/improved development environment. They deal with such things as routing, autoloading, low level abstractions for storage (no, I am not talking about active record anti\\-pattern) and the rest of thing that let save you time in boh development and maintenance.\n\n### In conclusion.\n\nThere are no MVC frameworks in PHP. All of those who claim to me such are actually among the worst ones. Namely \\- codeigniter, cakephp and yii. Avoid them at all costs (except if you get paid really well for it).\n\nIf you *need* to use a framework, currently your best options would be latest version of Symfony 2\\.x, Zend Framework 2\\.x or Laravel 4\\.x. These ones will **not implement MVC** for you, but instead will do the least harm for you own application architecture."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the relationship between MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and PHP frameworks?\n\nA) MVC is a feature that can be easily added to an application by using a framework that advertises \"MVC support\"\n\nB) The strictest implementation of MVC can be found in frameworks like CodeIgniter, CakePHP, and Yii\n\nC) Frameworks implement the MVC pattern, and applications built with these frameworks automatically follow MVC principles\n\nD) Frameworks provide tools and infrastructure, but the application itself must implement MVC principles through proper design and coding practices\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation emphasizes that frameworks do not implement MVC for you. Instead, they provide tools and an improved development environment. The application itself, designed and coded by the developer, is responsible for implementing MVC principles. The answer highlights that understanding MVC, along with other design principles like SOLID, LoD, and SoC, is crucial for proper implementation. The documentation also warns against frameworks that claim to \"have MVC\" as a feature, suggesting that this is often used as a marketing tactic rather than a true representation of the framework's capabilities.

With these switches the metal contacts can be pretty small, so it is not like you can attach a big heat sink in there. When I go to solder wires onto the switch, if I get the whole system (connector and wire) hot enough to melt solder, then the switch melts. In one case I was soldering and the contact just came right out of the switch because the plastic that was holding it in melted.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFrMS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFrMS.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Apply a small amount of solder to the clean soldering iron tip. This aids thermal transfer. You will see this mentioned in all guides on \"how to solder\" (if you don't see it mentioned, find another guide).\n2. Tin the wire you are going to connect. Go \"ouch! ouch!\" and remember to use something to hold the wire (a small vice is handy) so that you don't burn your fingers next time.\n3. Apply a small amount of solder to the clean (yes, you may need to clean it again: get used to doing that frequently) soldering iron tip.\n4. Place the wire on the connector on the switch.\n5. Apply the soldering iron so that it touches both at the same time.\n6. Wait one (1\\) second *at most* and then feed the solder into the gap between the soldering iron and the parts to be connected. If the solder does not melt straight away, remove the iron and peer at where you tried to apply it \\- maybe the angle wasn't quite right.\n7. Remove the solder. Remove the soldering iron.\n8. Inspect the joint when it has cooled down (say, 20 seconds for larger items). It should be shiny and with not\\-too\\-much, not\\-too\\-little solder. There must be no pointy bits hanging off it or shorts to other parts.\n\n**Cleaning** For cleaning the soldering iron tip, I have found that the curly brass sponge stuff is better than a wet sponge: the latter cools the tip down too much all of a sudden and tends to leave dross on the tip.\n\n**Temperature** If the solder on the tip of the iron looks \"off\" (becomes coloured or matte) really soon after applying it, then your soldering iron is too hot. If solder does melt as soon as you apply it to the tip, the soldering iron is not hot enough.\n\n**Solder** Solder with lead\\-containing solder with flux in it (e.g. multicore 60/40\\) is easier to use than lead\\-free solder. Do not use solder or flux intended for plumbing \\- they will destroy things.\n\n**Cleanliness** A good solder joint needs the surfaces to be soldered to be clean. You can get flux pens which dispense a small amount of flux when you apply them to the surfaces to be soldered. This is in addition the the flux which is in the solder. Flux chemically cleans the surfaces. It is generally a nuisance to remove afterwards, but you really should.\n\n**Fumes** The flux will give off fumes. You don't want to breathe them in or get them in your eyes as you will get a sore throat and eyes. Arrange for some sort of ventilation that keeps the fumes away from you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sequences best describes the correct order of steps for soldering a wire to a small plastic rocker switch?\n\nA) Clean the soldering iron tip, apply solder to the tip, tin the wire, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, feed solder, remove iron, inspect joint\n\nB) Tin the wire, clean the soldering iron tip, apply solder to the tip, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, feed solder, remove iron, inspect joint\n\nC) Apply solder to the tip, tin the wire, clean the soldering iron tip, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, feed solder, remove iron, inspect joint\n\nD) Clean the soldering iron tip, tin the wire, apply solder to the tip, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, feed solder, remove iron, inspect joint\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct sequence of steps is crucial for successful soldering, especially with small plastic rocker switches. Option D follows the recommended order: cleaning the tip first ensures good thermal transfer, tinning the wire prepares it for connection, applying solder to the cleaned tip again aids in heat transfer, then placing the wire and applying the iron simultaneously allows for quick and effective soldering. This method minimizes the risk of melting the plastic switch while ensuring a good connection."}}
