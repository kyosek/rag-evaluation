Thank you. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My first suggestion would be to use Logistic Regression (LR), at least to gain some understanding regarding input feature relationships to output. LR provides a lot more information than neural nets in this regard, since neural nets are much more black boxes.\n\nWhile neural networks tend to be black boxes, there are few things things that you can do, depending upon the type of neural network and the problem that you are solving. As an example, consider the image classification. Often the weight vectors for each neuron are examined to look for detection patterns. The results are generally edge detectors, etc.\n\n![https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1097/1823/7m/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/2010000/2001295/figs/f3.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbYEt.jpg)\n\nSimilar information is often shown by researchers in a dashboard that is presented at classification time.\n\n![http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/NeuralNetRecognition/Screenshot-GraphicalView.gif](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjjHj.gif)\n\nIn this image, there is also a visual indication of the output by class, indicating likelihood by class (8 being most likely in this image).\n\nYou might consider showing examples of inputs that your neural network gets consistently right and wrong when the predicted class is indicated.

The answer acknowledges that neural networks can be useful for complex problems like traffic forecasting, but also recognizes their \"black box\" nature.\n\n3.

What I mean is, how do different combinations of GFCI and/or AFCI protection relate when applied on a circuit breaker and/or an outlet?\n\nSome combinations I've heard/thought of already are as follows, but I'm not sure how the different protection methods and redundancy between the same kinds of protection can help or hurt one another. The items in bold are the ones in particular I'd like to learn more about. How does the combination of safety devices interact with one another?

Electrical arcs can start fires easily if they hit the wrong material.\n\n**GFCI detects a current differential on the \"hot\" and \"neutral\" wires**. In a functioning circuit, both wires carry exactly the same current. If there is a difference in current between the wires, it means current is leaking somewhere else. The \"somewhere else\" could be through you and cause injury or death.\n\nGFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n---------------------------\n\nThis is pointless, or at least overkill. GFCI's can fail, but the electrical code doesn't require you to wire up redundant GFCI's in series. The GFCI breaker protects the entire branch circuit. Likewise, one GFCI receptacle on a branch circuit can protect all of the downstream receptacles if wired correctly.\n\nDo test your GFCI's from time to time to ensure that they are still functioning correctly.\n\nAFCI breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n---------------------------\n\nThis will protect against fire (the AFCI will trip if there is an open arc), and it will also protect against severe human shock/electrocution. This is a fine combination and combines positive attributes of both types of protection.\n\nAFCI \\& GFCI combo breaker \\+ GFCI outlet\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs in the GFCI breaker/GFCI outlet scenario, the GFCI outlet is redundant and thus unnecessary to meet code requirements.\n\nEDIT\n----\n\nTester01 makes a good point about the possibility of getting shocked before a GFCI trips. You may get bit, but a properly functioning GFCI should trip within 25ms (0\\.025 seconds), at a voltage differential between 4 mA to 6 mA. Most people can feel electric shock starting around 1 mA, and it's a relatively mild to uncomfortable sensation up to 10 mA, after which it becomes painful. 10 mA is also the threshold where involuntary muscular contractions become strong enough that you may not be able to let go of the thing that is shocking you, and the current starts to become lethal between 75 mA where breathing becomes so difficult that it stops, and 200 mA. In any event, a properly\\-functioning GFCI should cut the current completely before you are permanently damaged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner wants to ensure maximum protection against both electrical fires and shock hazards in their kitchen.

While GFCIs protect against shock hazards, they don't address arc faults that can cause fires.\n\nOption B (Regular breaker + GFCI outlet) provides shock protection but lacks arc fault protection, making it insufficient for comprehensive safety.\n\nOption C (AFCI breaker + GFCI outlet) is the best choice. The AFCI breaker protects against electrical fires by detecting arc faults, while the GFCI outlet protects against shock hazards. This combination provides comprehensive protection without redundancy.\n\nOption D (AFCI & GFCI combo breaker + GFCI outlet) offers protection against both arc faults and shock hazards, but the additional GFCI outlet is redundant since the combo breaker already provides GFCI protection for the entire circuit."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/20", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/131469", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/46234/"], "docs_id": 131469, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there gambling in Grand Theft Auto 5?

For example, $F\\_1$ is comprised of 100 actual features. Before training a logistic regression classifier, I re\\-weight the *individual* feature sets (re\\-scaled between 0 and 1\\) as follows:\n\n$$F\\_x \\= w\\_x \\* F\\_x,$$\n\ni.e., by multiplying each feature set with a weight between 0 and 1\\.\n\nMy question is the following:\n\nAssuming I get (for the aforementioned example) weights: $\\\\mathcal{W} \\= \\\\{w\\_1 \\= 0\\.2, w\\_2 \\= 0\\.9,w\\_3 \\= 0\\.000004\\\\}$ (the index corresponds to an individual feature set from $F$).\n\nCan I interpret this in the lines of: \"The second feature set (2\\) contributes the most to the learning\" etc.?\n\nWith other words: How sensitive is logistic regression to such changes in feature values.\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This depends on whether you are talking about logistic regression or penalized (e.g. LASSO, ridge or elastic net) logistic regression.\n\n* In standard logistic regression re\\-scaling features in any way doesn't really make any difference to the maximum likelihood estimate (obviously, coefficients will correspondingly end up being re\\-scaled), unless you multiply the feature by 0 (which just destroys all information). I.e. if before re\\-scaling the log\\-odds for an event increase by 0\\.5 for every year of age and you multiply age by 0\\.1, then the new coefficient will be 5 (i.e. for every 10 years of age the log\\-odds go up by 5\\). However, re\\-scaling coefficients can cause or fix numerical issues in fitting a logistic regression model.\n* In penalized logistic regression, re\\-scaling features matters, because (as explained above) the absolute size of the maximum likelihood estimates changes and so features that were re\\-scaled with small factors get penalized more and those re\\-scaled with large factors get penalized less. Here, \"penalized more\" means that the regression coefficients will be shrunk from the maximum likelihood estimate relatively more towards zero than for the coefficients for other features.\n* The second bullet is why, if one has no particular reason to favor some features over others, it is common to standardize (i.e. center on zero and fix SD to 1\\) features before applying penalized logistic regression. The kind of approach you describe can be applied thereafter to do something like expressing a prior belief about which coefficients are more likely to be truly further away from zero. If done without standardizing first, I'm not really sure why I would do it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working with three feature sets (F1, F2, F3) for a logistic regression model.

In standard (non-penalized) logistic regression, re-scaling features by multiplying them by a constant (as long as it's not zero) doesn't affect the maximum likelihood estimates. The model will adjust the coefficients accordingly to compensate for the scaling. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the weights themselves don't determine feature importance in standard logistic regression. \n\nOption C is incorrect because in penalized regression, features with smaller weights (like F3) would actually be penalized more, not less, potentially reducing their influence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while re-scaling can sometimes cause or fix numerical issues, it doesn't necessarily always cause problems, especially in standard logistic regression.\n\nIt's important to note that in penalized logistic regression (like LASSO or ridge), these weights would matter more, as they would affect how much each feature set is penalized.

If you want to grep dmesg for your message once a minute, then just add a cron job that runs once a minute and greps dmesg for your message.\n\n```\n* * * * * if dmesg | tail -100 | grep -qs \"r8152.*Tx status -71\"; then /etc/kick-realtek.sh; fi\n\n```\n\n(The five asterisks are part of the crontab format and indicate the schedule time \\& date.)\n\nOne problem with that simple approach is it'll react to *all* such messages, even old ones logged before the last reset. You could avoid this by writing a marker line to dmesg (or even using an existing kernel message like \"USB device detected\" as the marker):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif dmesg | tail -100 | awk '/r8152.*Tx status -71/ {x=1} /KICKED/ {x=0} END {exit(!x)}'; then\n    /etc/kick-realtek.sh;\n    echo \"KICKED\" > /dev/kmsg;\nfi\n\n```\n\nAlternatively you could read and remember the last timestamp of such an error message, but that's much too complex in comparison.\n\n### Live monitoring\n\nAn even better option would be to use a program that continuously receives the log messages instead of having to do periodic checks. For example:\n\n```\ndmesg --follow | ...\n\njournalctl --dmesg --lines=10000 --follow | ...\n\ntail -n 10000 -f /var/log/kern.log | ...\n\n```\n\nRegardless of which one is used, pipe its output into a loop that checks each incoming line. Run the resulting script in background, ideally you could even turn it into a system service (/etc/systemd/system/\\*.service):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n... | while read -r line; do\n    if [[ $line == *r8152*Tx\\ status\\ -71* ]]; then\n        /etc/kick-realtek.sh\n    fi\ndone\n\n```\n\n(You could use `if echo \"$line\" | grep -qs ...; then` or similar, it doesn't matter.)\n\nFinally, many server systems *already have* a program that continuously receives all log messages, such as *rsyslog* or *syslog\\-ng*. (These programs are how dmesg gets copied to /var/log in the first place.) They can often filter the log messages and run programs:\n\n* [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog\\-execute\\-script\\-on\\-matching\\-log\\-event](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87223/rsyslog-execute-script-on-matching-log-event)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to create a system that automatically detects and responds to a specific error message in the kernel log.

On the other hand it surjects onto the secant variety $\\\\operatorname{Sec}\\_\\\\delta (X)$. \n\nNow if the general point of $\\\\Sigma^\\\\delta X$ is a divisor whose span has dimension $k\\<\\\\delta\\-1$, the same argument shows that the secant variety has dimension at most $\\\\delta\\+k$, which is even smaller."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a projective smooth curve X of genus g and its secant variety Sec_\u03b4(X), where \u03b4 = d/2. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X)?\n\nA) The dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is always exactly equal to d.\nB) The dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is always strictly less than d.\nC) The dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is less than or equal to d, and this upper bound is tight.\nD) The dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is always greater than d.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation proves that the dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is less than or equal to d. This is shown by considering two cases:\n\n1. When the general point of \u03a3^\u03b4X corresponds to \u03b4 projectively independent points, the dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is at most 2\u03b4-1 = d-1.\n\n2. When the general point of \u03a3^\u03b4X corresponds to a divisor whose span has dimension k < \u03b4-1, the dimension of Sec_\u03b4(X) is at most \u03b4+k, which is even smaller than d.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the dimension is less than or equal to d. The upper bound of d is tight because there could be cases where the dimension reaches d (e.g., when the curve is in a very special position). Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they don't accurately represent this relationship."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/05", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/366744", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/213713/"], "docs_id": 366744, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> It was upon the evening of this memorable Sunday that Sir Everard entered the library, where he narrowly missed surprising our young hero as he **went through the guards of the broadsword** with the ancient weapon of old Sir Hildebrand, which, being preserved as an heirloom, usually hung over the chimney in the library, beneath a picture of the knight and his horse, where the features were almost entirely hidden by the knight\u2019s profusion of curled hair, and the Bucephalus which he bestrode concealed by the voluminous robes of the Bath with which he was decorated.\n\nPlease help me understand correctly the above sentence from *Waverley* by Sir Walter Scott. \n\n\u2026went through the guards of the broadsword\u2026\n\nDoes it mean he put his hand through the guards of the sword, that is he seized it by the hilt? Or simply he examined the guards of the sword without touching them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Even with the context you provided, and being a native speaker, that sentence tripped me up a bit too, mostly because it's employing a unfamiliar sense of the word *guard* (which would have been more familiar to readers at the time Scott wrote *Waverly*).\n\nSo I'll tell you both what the word means and how I puzzled it out, which might help you in similar situations in the future.\n\nFirst, to answer your question directly, in this context, *guards* means:\n\n> the **posture of defence or readiness in fencing**, boxing, cricket, etc.\n\n*[Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/guard)* sense 20\n\nThe hints that this is the sense being employed are that the kid is *going through the guards* ***with*** a weapon, and that weapon usually *hangs over the chimney* (in the selfsame study), and the nephew was *surprised* at the entrance of his uncle, all of which tell us it is likely the kid took the sword off the wall and was practicing fencing with it.\n\nIn particular, he was practicing *the guards* of that kind of weapon; *guards* here meaning the **defensive positions in fencing**, similar to the images below (though these guards are specific to the longsword, not the broadsword as in the story):\n\n[![14 essential long-sword guard positions](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgLJ5.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgLJ5.jpg)\nimage credit: [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/explore/fencing-sword/)\n\nAnd, in case it's not clear to non\\-native speakers, *through* here is used in the sense of \"from A to Z\"; there is a fixed series of guards (as in the illustration above), and the kid was practicing each, one after another: he went *through* the series.\n\nIn short, the kid was play\\-fighting with the family's heirloom sword when his uncle walked in and nearly caught him."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Sir Walter Scott's \"Waverley,\" the phrase \"went through the guards of the broadsword\" refers to:\n\nA) The protagonist examining the physical guards of the sword without touching them\nB) The protagonist grasping the hilt of the sword and putting his hand through the guards\nC) The protagonist practicing a series of defensive fencing positions with the broadsword\nD) The protagonist cleaning and maintaining the different parts of the broadsword's hilt\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"went through the guards of the broadsword\" refers to the protagonist practicing a series of defensive fencing positions with the broadsword. In this context, \"guards\" means the postures of defense or readiness in fencing. The character was likely practicing these positions in sequence, going \"through\" them from start to finish.

But only one mysql instance, not a master/slave setup.\n* We typically use a command like this to take our backup `mysqldump -u $USERNAME -h $HOSTNAME -p $DB > $FILENAME`. Sometimes we also use the `--opt --skip-lock-tables` option.\n* When the db was smaller 2 years ago this wasn't a problem since it ran fast, but now that the db is large and the dump takes quite some time to finish, users experience slowness and downtime during the backup window.\n\nWhat can I do to make my database backups better, faster, less impactful on the website users while still maintaining a good, usable backup?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think this is more related to <http://dba.stackexchange.com> and has already been answered there quite often.\n\nTake a look:\n\n* [How can I optimize a mysqldump of a large database?](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/20/how-can-i-optimize-a-mysqldump-of-a-large-database)\n* [How can I backup a large SQL Server database without impacting performance?](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/30692/how-can-i-backup-a-large-sql-server-database-without-impacting-performance)\n* [Best practices for backing up a MySQL DB](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/50664/best-practices-for-backing-up-a-mysql-db/51014#51014)\n\nFor a quick and easy solution where you could stick to `mysqldump` you could also try splitting your dump down to specific tables to reduce the size.

What would that even mean, graphically and intuitively?\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Say you have a dataset with 2 features, $X$, and $Y$.\n\nCentering the features of this dataset would mean we make it so that the mean value of the new $X$ feature becomes $0$, and the mean value of the new $Y$ feature becomes $0$. \n\nIn other words, if we get a dataset where the $X$ and $Y$ feature\\-values are centered, that means that they're given in terms of the distance from the most average feature\\-values for that dataset. When $X$ is $0$ and $Y$ is $0$, that corresponds to the \"most average\" datapoint.\n\nNow, let's say we want to predict $Y$ based on $X$ by doing linear regression on this data\\-set. In other words, we are turning $Y$ into the label we want to predict, and $X$ into the single feature we're predicting it with. \n\nNow, what happens? If we don't center either of the random\\-variables, then our linear regression model will simply fit a line to the $Y\\_s$ based on the $X\\_s$. $$y\\=mx\\+b$$.\n\nThat's okay. However, in this case $\\+b$, the intercept, has absolutely no meaning. It's the label which our model predicts a datapoint would take when $X\\=0$. However, $X$ might correspond to a feature where equaling zero is absolutely senseless! For example, what if $X$ is the height of a newborn baby?\n\nBy centering $X$, the bias now has meaning. Since $X$ is centered, it now takes on a value of $0$ for its average value. That makes the bias, $\\+b$, equal to the $Y$ feature\\-value for the baby with \"the most average height!!!\" Pretty cool!\n\nNow, what if we center the $Y$ labels as well? What happens to the bias \\- what does it represent?\n\nFirst of all, notice what happens to the linear if we center the $Y$ labels. Centering the $Y$ labels means that we subtract the mean of $Y$ from each $y$ value, so that the value that was previously the mean.\n\nLet $X'$ be the centered feature, $Y$ be the uncentered label, and $Y'$ be the centered label.\n\nIf all we're doing is setting $Y'\\=Y\\-\\\\mu\\_y$, then our linear equation should go from...\n\n$$y\\=mx'\\+b$$\n\n...to...\n\n$y'\\=mx'\\+(b\\-\\\\mu\\_y)$\n\n...that is, all that should happen to our linear equation is that it should get shifted down by $\\\\mu\\_y$.\n\nSay that $Y$ corresponds to the weight of a newborn baby.\n\nBefore centering $Y$ and turning it into $Y'$, when $X'\\=0$ the linear equation told us what we should predict the weight of a newborn baby of average height to be. That was $b$.\n\nNow, when $X'\\=0$, we instead get $b\\-\\\\mu\\_y$. That is, we get the expected difference between the weight of a newborn baby of average height and the average weight of these babies!\n\nNow, for each value of $X'$, what we're getting is the expected difference between the weight of a baby whose height is $X'$ away from the average height and the weight of the baby with the average weight!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a linear regression model predicting newborn baby weights from their heights, both the feature (height) and the label (weight) have been centered.

In this case:\n\n- Centering the height (X) means that X=0 represents the average height.\n- Centering the weight (Y) means we're now predicting the difference from the average weight.\n\nThe bias term (b - \u03bc_y) represents the model's prediction when X=0. This means it's predicting the weight difference for a baby of average height (since X=0 is now the average height).\n\nTherefore, the bias term represents the expected difference between the weight of a newborn baby of average height and the average weight of all babies in the dataset.\n\nOption A is incorrect because centering the weight removes the direct representation of average weight.\nOption B would be correct if only the height was centered, but not the weight.\nOption D is incorrect as the bias term is representing a weight difference, not a height."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/08", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/641", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/231/"], "docs_id": 641, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been playing Age of Empires \\- Conquerors for more than 6 years.

An xcopy type private deployment could be much faster.\n\nIt seems to me that mono allows private deployment which solves all these issues.\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a simple reason why MS does not like this model \\- if any program contains its own version of the .NET framework DLLs, Windows Update would not effectively be able to supply any security updates / bug fixes any more for the .NET framework DLLs. And this is not a hypothetical issue: every few months, a new patch or security update for the framework DLLs was deployed by MS in the past. \n\nThe situation that MS gave specific run time DLLs to the application vendors, and let the vendors be responsible for deploying and updating the DLLs themselves, is not a new one. For example, the MFC\\-DLLs, the GDI\\+ DLLs and some other libraries were often deployed that way. But this almost always lead to a situation where users had troubles in getting important updates for these DLLs. See, for example, [here](http://www.lafn.org/webconnect/mentor/GdiJpegVulnerability/index.html), for the case from 2004 where gdiplus.dll had to be updated \\- and what trouble that meant for the users, compared to a relatively flawless update using the \"Windows Update\" mechanisms. From that experience I guess MS came to the conclusion not to give the responsibility for updates out of their hands.\n\nTo your arguments:\n\n> 1\\) We often don't use all the dlls but we force customers to install the entire .NET framework. It would be great to just deploy the dlls we need.\n\nNewer Windows version already contain .NET FW 3\\.5 or 4\\.0 And if not, the framework has to be installed *once* per machine (ok, 3\\.5 once and 4\\.0 once), not again and again for every application which needs it\n\n> 2\\) We often want to update our application and the framework but that sometimes requires a machine reboot because other applications are using it.\n\nYou typically don't want to update the framework by yourself, Windows Update does that for you. And if you are going to use a newer framework version which so far is not installed on the machine, there obviously cannot be another application using the newer framework so far.\n\n> 3\\) A full .NET installation usually takes quite a bit of time. An xcopy type private deployment could be much faster.\n\nYes, but only once per machine, not once per application.\n\n@BryantB's answer is also true. Especially, because the execution model of .NET assemblies does not check if all needed assemblies are installed before the JITer compiles a function call to one of those assemblies. This means, if you forget to deploy a framework DLL, your program might start flawlessly, but will crash later when the first feature is used which needs the forgotten DLL. This behaviour is quite different from native DLLs (not delay\\-loaded ones, of course), and would be a dangerous error\\-trap."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason Microsoft discourages private deployment of .NET framework DLLs with individual applications?\n\nA) It increases the size of application installations unnecessarily.\nB) It prevents Windows Update from effectively providing security updates for .NET framework DLLs.\nC) It makes application deployment faster and more convenient for developers.\nD) It allows applications to use only the specific DLLs they need, reducing system bloat.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. The documentation clearly states that if programs contain their own versions of .NET framework DLLs, Windows Update would not be able to effectively supply security updates and bug fixes for these DLLs. This is a critical security concern, as Microsoft regularly releases patches and updates for the framework.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while private deployment might increase installation size, this is not the primary concern mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOption C is actually an argument in favor of private deployment, not against it, so it cannot be the reason Microsoft discourages this practice.\n\nOption D, like C, is presented as an advantage of private deployment in the original question, not a reason against it.\n\nThe question tests the candidate's ability to identify the key security concern in centralized framework management versus the convenience factors of private deployment."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/12/29", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/351427", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/101385/"], "docs_id": 351427, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to count all review products in Magento 2 like :\n\nThere are 5 reviews 1 star\n\nThere are 3 reviews 2 star\n....\n\nPls Help me, Thanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: basically, you can't do that.

I wanted the ability that context managers provide, but I wanted to be able to have it defined in one function, and to be able to layer function after function on top. \n\nUPDATE:\n\nFor clarity I've added the implementation:\n\n```\n\n_wrap = partial(reduce, lambda inner, outer: partial(outer, inner))\ndef wrap(fns):\n    fns = tuple(fns)\n    if len(fns)==1:\n        return fns[0]\n    return lambda *a, **kw: _wrap(iter(fns))(*a, **kw)\n\n```\n\nand an example:\n\n```\n\ndef fn_one(fn, *a, **kw):\n  print \"entered one\"\n  response = fn(*a, **kw)\n  print \"exited one\"\n  return response\n\ndef fn_two(fn, *a, **kw):\n  print \"entered two\"\n  response = fn(*a, **kw)\n  print \"exited two\"\n  return response\n\ndef zero():\n  print \"zero\"\n\nwrapped_zero = wrap((zero, fn_one, fn_two))\nwrapped_zero() # returns entered two, entered one, zero, exited one, exited two \n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: tl;dr\n-----\n\nThis is called currying, also sometimes schoenfinkelization and it's built\\-in default behaviour in Haskell and derivative languages. Plausibly other languages to I'm unfamiliar with.\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying>\n\n> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of\n>  transforming a function that takes n multiple arguments (or an n\\-tuple\n>  of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of\n>  functions, each with a single argument (partial application). It was\n>  originated by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel\\[1] and later re\\-discovered by Haskell\n>  Curry.\\[2]\\[3] Because of this, some say it would be more correct to\n>  name it sch\u00f6nfinkeling.\\[4]\\[5]\n\n---\n\nUnnecessary details on currying:\n--------------------------------\n\nAny language with higher order functions can have this behaviour mimicked, generics greatly help it be not clumsy, but the least clumsy languages for this are functional ones with facilities specifically to do it.\n\nThat said here are some articles about doing it in various languages to illustrate as you said it is a pattern:\n\n[http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon\\_skeet/archive/2012/01/30/currying\\-vs\\-partial\\-function\\-application.aspx](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2012/01/30/currying-vs-partial-function-application.aspx)\n\n[http://mtomassoli.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/currying\\-in\\-python/](http://mtomassoli.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/currying-in-python/)\n\n<https://wiki.php.net/rfc/currying>\n\nBy default in haskell, every function takes no more than one value and returns one value, until eventually it takes no values and returns a value.\n\nThis is written as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: inputVal -> (returnVal)\n\n```\n\nThis becomes currying as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: inputVal1 -> (inputVal2 -> (inputVal3 -> (returnVal))))\n\n```\n\nIn this example, someFunc takes a value, and returns (a function which takes a value and returns (a function which takes a value and returns (a value)))).\n\nEach of the functions in that chain take one value, the last return is not a function as it does not take anything but rather holds a computation (perhaps 1\\+2, something that doesn't take parameters).\n\nI say this is default behaviour in Haskell because in Haskell, passing 2 values to someFunc will hand it one value, and hand the next value to the returned function, returning the 3rd function in the chain.\n\ni.e. using the signature above, if I defined someFunc as:\n\n```\nsomeFunc x y z = x + y + z\n\n```\n\nthen I call it as:\n\n```\nplusTwo :: inputVal3 -> (returnVal)\nplusTwo = someFunc 1 1\n\n```\n\nNow I have captured the 2nd returned function in the chain by giving it one parameter which causes it to return the first function, and the second parameter I gave it is curried into that first returned function causing it to be called and return the 3rd function, which I use as the value for `plusTwo`\n\nSo in closing, currying works about like so:\n\ngiven:\n\n```\nsomeFunc a b c d = a + b + c + d\nplusOne   = someFunc 1\nplusTwo   = someFunc 1 1\nplusThree = someFunc 1 1 1\n    four  = someFunc 1 1 1 1\n\n```\n\nThe signatures would be:\n\n```\nsomeFunc :: a -> (b -> (c -> (d -> (e))))\n       plusOne :: b -> (c -> (d -> (e)))\n             plusTwo :: c -> (d -> (e))\n                 plusThree :: d -> (e)\n                            four :: e\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information about currying:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following Haskell-style function signature:\n\nsomeFunc :: a -> (b -> (c -> (d -> e)))\n\nWhich of the following statements is true about this function and currying?\n\nA) someFunc can only be called with exactly 4 arguments at once\nB) someFunc 1 2 3 4 and (((someFunc 1) 2) 3) 4 are equivalent\nC) It's impossible to partially apply someFunc\nD) The result of someFunc 1 2 will always be a concrete value, not a function\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because currying allows the function to be called with fewer arguments, returning partially applied functions.\nB is correct because currying makes these two ways of calling the function equivalent.\nC is incorrect because currying explicitly enables partial application.\nD is incorrect because someFunc 1 2 would return a function of type c -> (d -> e), not a concrete value.\n\nThe key to understanding this is that in curried functions, every function takes one argument and returns either another function or a final value.

But the net allocates over 1GB of RAM when I train it. What is all that memory needed for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I found out some of the factors that may contribute to the effect.\n\n1\\) At least in tiny\\-cnn, some of the buffers are allocated not once but once per **worker thread**. On a machine with **8** CPU threads, this can increase the memory usage a lot.\nIn debug mode using MS VC\\+\\+ 2015 the following two lines in the code base allocate a big chunk, both related to worker threads: [`ith_in_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L481) and [`ith_out_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L485).\n\n2\\) Additionally to the values for the neurons and weights listed in my question, also gradients and some other stuff for the backward passes and the optimization have to be stored.\n\n3\\) Not sure if this is relevant fot tiny\\-cnn, but many frameworks seem to use an operation called **im2col**. This makes the convolution much faster, by expressing it as a matrix multiplication. But in case of filters with 3\\*3 in height and width, this scales the number of values from the input to a convolution up by a factor of **9**.\nJustin Johnson explains it in the lecture [\"S231n Winter 2016 Lecture 11 ConvNets in practice\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue4RJdI8yRA) starting at 36:22\\.\n\n4\\) There was an **error in my initial calculation**. When a volume of 512\\*512\\*3 is convolved with 6 3\\*3 filters and then send into an average pooling layer, the result volume is 256\\*256\\*6, but in between it is 512\\*512\\*6, also contributing with a factor of **2**.\n\n5\\) There was **another error in my initial calculation**. I demonstrate it on the last conv layer (7\\). It takes a volume of 16\\*16\\*96 to a volume of 8\\*8\\*192 with filters of size 3\\*3\\. This means every filter has 3\\*3\\*96 weights, and there are 192 of them, resulting in 165888 (3\\*3\\*96\\*192\\) weights overall for this layer, not 6912\\.\n\nSo numerologically multiplying only the first three factors (8, 9 and 2\\) we end up with a factor of 144, which seems enough to explain the high memory consumption."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A neural network with convolutional layers is being implemented for image processing.

So... I tore the wall down and will be using proper wood screws to fasten the clips. It's all about peace of mind in the end. I have a company coming in a few weeks to mud the walls I put up so I can prime and paint and I don't want to keep worrying about whether or not that wall is going to come crashing down, be it on me or the people who buy my townhouse when I decide to move.\n\nMy advice: **Never use drywall screws to bear any load.** As others have already stated, they're not designed to bear load. For that type of application, use proper screws with adequate strength.\n\n**Original question below:**\n\nI originally asked this question back in February and want to reword it in hopes that I can get a more obective answer. Here are the screws in question:\n\n[http://www.lowes.com/pd\\_112628\\-10681\\-S05CDW212\\_0\\_\\_?productId\\=3198059](http://www.lowes.com/pd_112628-10681-S05CDW212_0__?productId=3198059)\n\nLate last year, I hung two layers of type\\-X drywall on a furring channel assembly for a soundproofing project. The entire assembly goes like this:\n\n* Mounted 5 rows of Genie Clips (RSIC) to studs using the above\\-linked 2 1/2\" drywall screws. There are 25 clips total in the whole assembly. The clips are 1\" thick, so 1\" of the screw is outside the stud. However, it's fastened snug against the clip, so it's not like there's exposed screw sticking out of anything.\n* 5 rows of metal furring channels (hat channels) are snapped into the clips from the top of the wall to the bottom.\n* Two layers of type\\-X drywall at 72 lbs per 4x8 sheet are fastened to the furring channels using the same screws. There are 7 sheets, so 7x72 \\= 504 lbs. This wall is suspended, so it's not touching the ceiling, walls, or floor.\n\nThe instructions said I could use drywall or wood screws so long as they're coarse thread. Only after I got the wall installed did I learn of \"shear strength\" and that drywall screws are very brittle, snapping under pressure rather than bending like wood screws. This got me worried, so I came here to see if this wall is safe.\n\nIf the math is simple, we can take the total weight of the assembly (520 lbs if you add the approximate weight of the furring channels) and divide that by 25 (the number of clips) and arrive 20\\.8 lbs, the minimum average weight capcity per screw in order for the wall to hold up without anything being attached to it (dart boards, mirrors, portraits, etc).\n\nBut I am sure there are other factors here. For example:\n\n* If a screw has a shear strength of 20 lbs, do 25 of those screws together in an assembly average out at 20 lbs each or is there some kind of cumulative increase that would allow each screw to support more weight the more screws of its kind exist in the same assembly?\n* What is shear strength vs. shock strength? I saw a video of a guy taking a hammer sideways against a drywall screw and snapping it off, but that seemed a little unfair since an assembly stays still. You don't have strong and sudden downward forces occuring within your wall, so was that video a valid demonstration of a drywall screw's brittleness?\n\nI am obviously asking all this because I don't want the wall to come crashing down one day. If I have to tear it down and remount the clips using wood screws, I will have to do just that. However, if someone can provide a convincing argument that having all this weight supported by 25 drywall screws is okay (it's not framing or anything) then I will be able to sleep better at night.\n\n**Update:**\n\nSo I decided to do the test I talked about in my original question prior to rewriting it. What you see in these pics is a mock Genie Clip assembly. It's a spare 2x4 screwed into a wall stud with 3 screws. A Genie Clip is fastened to the spare stud with one of the screws linked above. This pic shows the assembly supporting 130 lbs of weight (total of 4 dumbells weight 50, 40, 25, and 15 lbs)!\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hhMO.jpg)\n\n![Genie Clip supporting 130 lbs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3HJ7.jpg)\n\nSo if each drywall screw can support at least 130 lbs and I have 25 clip assemblies holding up this wall, I think it's safe to say that I could probably put at least 3,250 lbs on this wall. Since it weighs no more than 525 lbs as is, I think I am more than safe. Next time, though, I will use wood screws since that's the proper way to do it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's difficult to model the situation with rational analysis, there's too many intangible factors. You could do an empirical test. You need to support 20 lbs per fastener. We can apply a safety factor of 3 for ultimate strength, so the fastener should support 60 lbs without actually breaking. So you would need 2\\-4 fasteners to support your weight. Round down to the closest whole number. Install the clips as you did in the wall, except now install a metal strap between the screw head and clip. Arrange the straps so you can step into them to weight the system. Arrange the straps such that your weight is distributed evenly to each fastener.\n\nWeight the system and see if they break. If you live in a seismic area, bounce on them a bit and see if they break. You'll either be able to sleep better or you'll know what to do next, depending on the outcome. Obviously there are better ways to set up an empirical test, I chose to illustrate a quick and dirty method just as an example. Be sure you are protected from flying shards of metal.\n\nRegarding an increaser for the number of fasteners. No, you can't do that. It is a valid concept though, for example you can use a higher allowable bending stress in multiple floor joists than you can in a single use situation such as a header. The concept is not generally applied to fasteners.\n\n**Response to OP's Update**\n\nShear strength in relation to fasteners partly depends on what the fastener is holding. In this case it's known as a metal side plate condition, meaning the expected failure mode will either be the top of the screw failing through the shank (shear) or the wood collapsing under the compression from the screw. It's rare in reality to have a perfect shear condition, there is usually some bending and tension components as well.\n\nA true shear condition would something like a metal strap screwed to the wood surface and all the force was parallel to the wood surface, exactly perpendicular to the screw shank. In your test, you mostly have the vertical shear component, but there is a tension component as the center of mass is away from the wall surface. We can safely ignore the tension component in calculating a working load since 80\\# in pure shear is more conservative than 80\\# shear and, oh... say 15\\# tension combined.\n\nA picture of the clip was helpful, I imagined a much worse condition. Either way, the ultimate strength will not be proportional to shear alone, there are other factors difficult to model, thus testing is the best approach. The failure mode you experienced is a bending failure, but your actual installation, while having a bending component, is in fact mostly a shear condition.\n\nThe duration of load is a factor. The usual allowable stresses specified in construction are for permanently applied loads. The allowable stresses can be increased for shorter durations, 15% for a few months, 25% for a few weeks, 33% for a few minutes. Meaning we should reduce the allowable load determined through short term tests accordingly. But we also don't know the ultimate load since you didn't achieve failure. Just as well, uncontrolled destructive testing can be a little too exciting. You also haven't run multiple tests (I assume) to confirm you are getting consistent results.\n\nLet's say you did run multiple tests and they all actually failed at 80\\#. When you apply the 3x safety factor, then adjust for duration of load, you end up with a working load of 20\\#, exactly what you need. Considering there was no failure experienced, and the installation does appear to be predominantly shear, I think your installation is safe. Barely. Next time around, use heavy ordinary wood screws ;)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a soundproofing wall assembly using Genie Clips, furring channels, and two layers of Type-X drywall.

The balance usually has four load cells at four corners, each of which connects to a HX711 weight sensor with a sort of Wheatstone bridge measuring voltage.\n2. When you step on the balance (or placing your luggage on the balance), you don't place yourself in a good balance, spreading evenly over the four corners. (For luggage balance, there might be many more load cells.)\n3. The host controller would wait for the slow human's four readings to settle down, and use some simple algorithms (spatial/time moving average etc) to try to \"balance\" the unbalanced/unevenly spread readings.\n4. In short, it is the unsteady human body, or the \"unsteadyily placed\" luggage that take time to settle down. The HX711 sensor itself is 24 bit accurate, and only takes 0\\.1 second to do the analog to digital conversion.\n\n---\n\n***References***\n\n(1\\) [Hacking a body weight scale \\- rpi.org.forum 2018dec16](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=77158&start=475#p1404713)\n\n(2\\) [HX711 weight sensor \\- Rpi.org.forum 2018nov17](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=227137)\n\n(3\\) [HX711 24\\-Bit Analog\\-to\\-Digital Converter (ADC) for Weigh Scales Datasheet \\- Avia Semiconductor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf)\n\n(4\\) [HX711 24\\-Bit ADC (with load cell mV output pre amp, no programming needed) Tutorial \\- Components 101, 2018sep28](https://components101.com/ics/hx711-24-bit-analog-digital-converter-adc)\n\n(5\\) [Mini Pocket Digital Scale for Gold Silver Jewelry 100g\\-0\\.01/200g\\-0\\.01/500g\\-0\\.01 \\- AliExpress US$5](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32754125094.html?spm=a2g0o.search0302.0.0.5ce1717dlKf6tO&algo_pvid=4bd6b607-8d97-4bab-89e8-3d5eee46fa89&algo_expid=4bd6b607-8d97-4bab-89e8-3d5eee46fa89-45&btsid=0b0a555616215727243454146e4cfe&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_)\n\n---\n\n***Appendices***\n\n*Appendix A \\- HX711 weight sensor and load cell*\n\n[![hx711 weight sensor and load cell](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDIgW.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDIgW.png)\n\n---\n\n*Appendix B \\- Hacking a body weight scale*\n\n[![hack1 ](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1gb0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1gb0.png)\n\n---\n\n[![hack 2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VM7Zo.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VM7Zo.jpg)\n\n---\n\n[![hack 3](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKYmS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKYmS.png)\n\n---\n\n*Appendix C \\- HX711 Evaluation Notes*\n\n[![hx711 block diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ALBR.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ALBR.jpg)\n\n---\n\n*Appendix D \\- Accuracy and Precision Measurement Results*\n\n[![accuracy measurement results](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7nCbB.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7nCbB.png)\n\nWiki says the following:\n\n***Accuracy in a set of measurements, is closeness of the measurements to a specific value***\n\nUsing 50g standard weight as the bench mark, I found the closeness is max 50\\.00g and min 49\\.96g.

This question tests understanding of how command substitution and the test command ([ ]) work in bash.\n\n$(false) doesn't evaluate to false, but to an empty string. When used unquoted in the test command, it disappears entirely. So the command effectively becomes:\n\n```bash\nif [ -o ]; then\n```\n\nIn this context, -o is not interpreted as the OR operator, but as a single string argument to the test command. According to the POSIX specification, when test is given a single non-null argument, it returns true. Therefore, the condition is true, and \"Success\" is printed.\n\nThis is a common pitfall when working with command substitution and test conditions in bash. To properly use command exit statuses in conditions, one should use them directly without $() or [ ], like this:\n\n```bash\nif false || false; then\n```\n\nThis question highlights the importance of understanding how different bash constructs interact and the potential for unexpected behavior when combining them incorrectly."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/14", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/465924", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/205359/"], "docs_id": 465924, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been getting so used to vim's hjkl for moving around recently, and find myself wanting to use them right after alt tabbing out of vim.\n\nWhat would be the best way to map fn \\+ h/j/k/l to left/down/up/right?\n\nedit: any `<modifier>` \\+ h/j/k/l would be satisfactory as long as it doesn't conflict with other keyboard shortcuts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Try these, no guarantee if it will break anything, but I hope it won't:\n\n1. if you look at the mapping by `xmodmap -pke`, you see it has four columns of characters mapped to each key, for different modifications. The order for these modifications is like\n\n`keycode <x> = <1> <2> <3> <4>`\n\n`<1> <key>`\n\n`<2> <shift-key>`\n\n`<3> <\"Mode_switch\"-key>`\n\n`<4> <shift-\"Mode_switch\"-key>`\n2. \"Mode\\_switch\", not completely sure, but I guess maps to nothing by default. Actually, you can see the code for the key with `xmodmap` and looking for it somewhere at the bottom of the results and finding out what key that code belongs to. What I did was I reassinged it to another key, for example `Super_L`, which is the lefp super key, with these:\n\n```\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Super_L = Mode_switch\"\n\n```\n\nor you can put your own choise in place of `Super_L`\n3. Now, go ahead and edit the column for the four keys you wanted to reassign. Let's find them in your `xmodmap` file:\n\n```\nxmodmap -pke | grep h\n\n```\n\namong the output should be line which says\n\n```\nkeycode 43 = h H h H\n\n```\n\nedit it so that it's like\n\n```\nkeycode 43 = h H Left H\n\n```\n\nto do that, use the command\n\n```\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 43 = h H Left H\"\n\n```\n\nand then try if it worked.\n4. Do that for the rest of the keys you want to map.\n\nI think this is not likely to break anything serious, as long as you can go back and reedit the `keycode`s to their originals. The only scary part was where I mapped \"Mode\\_switch\" to Super\\_L. (**Edit**: this actually disabled my super key, which I was able to get back to work by reversing the assignment, that's `xmodmap -e \"keysym Mode_switch = Super_L\"`.
