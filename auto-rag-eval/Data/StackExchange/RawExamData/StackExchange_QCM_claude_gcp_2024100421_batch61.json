Is it the fact that the sample size is non\\-existent when doing say, purposive or quota sampling, what impedes us from generating sampling errors of the estimate to later calculate confidence intervals? \n\nI then thought, well, regardless of the sampling method use (probability based or not), you'll end up with a certain sample size. Can this not be used to then calculate SE of the estimate, and ultimately confidence intervals. Or perhaps, it all comes down to my final suspicion: one can certainly calculate SE for an estimate and then proceed to generate the CIs, but these will ultimately be wrong given the poor consideration of the sampling design.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have a different take on this. A confidence interval confronts the sample with a certain probability model. It basically gives a set of parameters, under the model, that are consistent with the sample. Obviously the model is wrong in various respects (as all models are, according to George Box at least), independence and others; the question is whether it is still sensible enough so that it makes sense to think about the underlying reality in terms of the model. An appropriate random sampling method is a device that makes some (but not all) of the model assumptions plausible. In the absence of such a sampling method, one needs to think about whether and how the way the sample was actually collected can affect the conclusions that are made from the confidence interval. The confidence interval itself is a mathematically well defined set of numbers \\- there's nothing wrong with it. What is the problem is really how this is interpreted and used in practice. There are many procedures for collecting samples that will invalidate the model in critical ways, thus invalidating conclusions (take for example something that was recently discussed on Andrew Gelman's blog, researchers doing animal experiments grabbing whatever mouse comes to their hand from the cage, which systematically will choose mice that move more, and are potentially more healthy and energetic).\n\nHowever, in other cases even critical appraisal does not throw up clear reasons why a sample might deviate systematically from a proper random sample, and confidence intervals are also interpreted cautiously as potentially imprecise indicators of uncertainty, maybe just for comparing different aspects in a study where the same data collection was used across the board, and then the standard confidence interval may be OK. It's not without risks (there can be problems that the researchers miss), but then model\\-based reasoning always comes with this kind of risk, even with \"proper\" random sampling.\n\nOf course what whuber alludes to in their comment to the other answer is also true \\- there may be a model for the specific non\\-i.i.d. sampling mechanism that has actually been applied, and this can be used to compute more appropriate confidence intervals in that case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducts a study using purposive sampling and calculates confidence intervals for their estimates.

As explained in the documentation, confidence intervals are mathematically well-defined sets of numbers, regardless of the sampling method. However, their interpretation and practical use depend heavily on how the sample was collected. With non-probability sampling methods like purposive sampling, the researcher needs to carefully consider how the sampling method might affect the conclusions drawn from the confidence intervals. \n\nWhile the intervals can be calculated, they may not reflect the true uncertainty in the population if the sampling method introduces systematic biases. The confidence intervals should be interpreted cautiously as potentially imprecise indicators of uncertainty, and researchers should critically appraise whether there are clear reasons why their sample might deviate systematically from a proper random sample.\n\nOption A is incorrect because confidence intervals can still be calculated and may provide some insight, even if they need to be interpreted cautiously. Option C is incorrect because the sample size alone doesn't address potential biases introduced by non-random sampling methods.

I then created a subset of the data using only the nearest features to the project area to create a boundary.\n\nMy problem is my data has some issues with overlap. In some areas the civil townships are coincident with bodies of water or roads and the polyline for both types of feature are overlapping (or close to overlapping) in my subset of the data. I would like to clean up the data so there is only 1 line for each section of the boundary and duplicate boundary lines are deleted. after I get a clean polyline feature I was planning and using the feature to polygon tool to create the the final boundary.\n\nIs there a simple method of cleaning up this data?\n\nI already have used topology rules to clean up a few thing such as dangles, but I couldn't really find a rule that applied to my situation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These are a few tools I use to cleanup lines:\n\n* integrate \\- make vertices\n* match between near features\n* planarize \\- split overlapping lines at intersections\n* extend/snap \\- snap lines\n* trim line \\- delete\n* dangles meeting a certain length\n* dissolve \\- remove duplicate overlapping lines"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS analyst is working on creating a project boundary from various polyline and polygon data sources.

However, ground moisture won't be a problem at all on at least two walls.\n\nI'm planning on insulating either with Roxul rockwool insulation or with polyiso foam. (I haven't decided yet.) The polyiso foam comes with a foil backer that behaves as a moisture and vapor barrier.

A lot of new construction in the far north has this as a default. The idea is that you frame right outside of that. In that framing you are allotting a cavity to which moisture can move and evaporate. \n\nNow if you are putting rockwool or other types of insulation in your framing then no you do not use a moisture barrier.

Applying a concrete sealant helps prevent moisture intrusion. Using rigid foam insulation against the concrete provides both insulation and a moisture barrier. Adding a vapor barrier over the foam creates an additional layer of protection. Finally, framing and insulating the cavity with rockwool allows for any moisture that does penetrate to evaporate within the wall cavity, preventing trapped moisture issues.

Here's why:\n\n1. The code iterates through a list of tuples, where each tuple contains another tuple as a key and an integer as a value.\n2. It creates an empty dictionary called 'output'.\n3. For each item in the list, it checks if the tuple key (i[0]) exists in the output dictionary.\n4. If the key exists, it adds the corresponding value (i[1]) to the existing sum.\n5.

Basemap tiles are shuffled and do not correspond to lat/lon, but overlay is ok.\n\nAccording to the [osmdroid Map Sources](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/wiki/Map-Sources) page, ESRI map services use the **ZYX** URL tile numbering format instead of slippy maps' **ZXY** that osmdroid uses. \n\n> ZYX \\- Some map tile servers, such as some ESRI based products, use the Zoom/Y/X URL format. Since it's trivial to convert to ZXY, support for this format is easy to setup on osmdroid. We currently have at least one map source that uses this mechanism (see USGS maps).\n\nDid you account for that?

Reduce the max zoom level to 11 or lower.\n\nB) The tile source URL is incorrect.

Implement a custom TileSource that converts between these formats.\n\nD) The mapView projection is incorrect. Set the correct projection using mapView.setProjection() method.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue stems from a mismatch in tile numbering formats between OSMDroid and ArcGIS. OSMDroid uses the ZXY (Zoom/X/Y) format for slippy maps, while ArcGIS uses the ZYX (Zoom/Y/X) format. To resolve this, a custom TileSource needs to be implemented that converts between these formats. This explains why the tiles appear shuffled - they are being placed in the wrong positions due to the mismatched coordinate system.

So it\u2019s very hard to pronounce or hear the sounds combined consonants in a row. Would you explain how to make the \u2018fts\u2019 sound in tufts, minutely? [\\[audio]](http://audioscraps.tistory.com/149)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consonant clusters like this are not all that comfortable for native English speakers either. Carefully pronouncing all the consonants is more work than it's worth, and actually sounds unnatural. Usually there is some degree of elision. Each speaker evolves a personal, 'idiolectal' approach; but there are a couple of general tendencies which make these word\\-final clusters easier.\n\n* The final consonant is 'carried over' to head the following syllable if this results in an acceptable syllable head. In your example, for instance, the collocation *tufts out* is read as if it were *tuft sout*. The cluster /st/ is a frequent syllable head, so the word *Borstal* is spoken *Bor stal*. Occasionally this will involve eliding the beginning of the following syllable: *tufts had*, for instance, would be spoken as *tuft sad*.\n* Stops (/p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/) which close a syllable or occur before a consonant are not aspirated, and if a following consonant has the same point of articulation they virtually disappear. In your example, /t/ and /s/ have the same point of articulation, and the /t/ is discernible only as a slight sharpening of the attack on the /s/ \\-\\- which, as said, heads the following syllable. There's not even a complete closure of the airflow, only a slightly marked narrowing: /tuf\\-sout/. (I have no idea how the IPA represents this.) This will be true at the end of a sentence, too, where there's no carryover: *He pulled his hair out in tufts* .. /tuf\\-s/\n\nThe most useful thing to keep in mind is that people don't speak in words but 'utterances', and they will redistribute the word boundaries to suit established oral patterns."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When pronouncing consonant clusters like \"fts\" in \"tufts\", what is the most natural approach for native English speakers?\n\nA) Carefully enunciating each individual consonant sound\nB) Completely omitting one or more consonants in the cluster\nC) Redistributing the consonants across syllable boundaries and slightly modifying their pronunciation\nD) Inserting a short vowel sound between each consonant in the cluster\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the documentation, native English speakers tend to redistribute consonants across syllable boundaries and slightly modify their pronunciation when dealing with difficult consonant clusters. This process involves:\n\n1. Carrying over the final consonant to the next syllable if possible (e.g., \"tufts out\" becomes \"tuft sout\").\n2. Modifying the pronunciation of stops (like /t/) before consonants with the same point of articulation, resulting in a slight sharpening of the attack rather than a full pronunciation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because carefully pronouncing each consonant is described as \"more work than it's worth\" and sounds unnatural.\n\nOption B is too extreme; while some modification occurs, complete omission of consonants is not typical.\n\nOption D is incorrect as native speakers don't typically insert vowel sounds between consonants in these clusters.\n\nThe key point is that speakers adjust their pronunciation to suit established oral patterns, treating speech as a continuous flow of utterances rather than distinct words."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/20", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/436921", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/260265/"], "docs_id": 436921, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My recently installed Ubuntu (and ALL the other distros I used before) sometimes (not\\-always) hangs on boot.\n It's a hard\\-to\\-debug problem because it just happens 'sometimes' (I never know when the boot will hang).\n When the problem arrives, the screen STOPS in a \"Ubuntu purple\" empty screen, just after the \"purple GRUB\" screen.

Will he/she continue to fulfill the same responsibilities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Scrum Master is a coaching role. Lyssa Adkins borrows the Shu\\-Ha\\-Ri approach from Aikido when talking about coaching teams. (I only know this model from coaching, I have no idea how faithfully it's adopted).\n\nEarly in Scrum maturity, the team is in the **Shu** level. They need to understand how the mechanics of Scrum work, develop discipline in the practices, and learn how to be effective in the new approach. The Scrum Master acts as a guide in these areas.\n\nIn the **Ha** level, the team understands the rules of Scrum and wants to bend them or expand on them to adjust the method of working to their needs. Here, the Scrum Master helps the team structure these experiments and drives transparency so that the team gets the most out of these improvements. \n\nFinally, in the **Ri** level, the team has a deep understanding of how and why Scrum works and can apply these principles to develop completely new and novel ways of working. The Scrum Master here acts in a purely coaching role, stimulating and encouraging the team in their thinking.\n\nThere is no timeline for this. If the team has never followed Scrum as recorded, they've never really settled into the Shu level. Similarly, if they have always stuck by the rules, they've probably had this level mastered for a long time, but never moved on. \n\nThis is just in coaching the team. Of course, there is a whole organization around the team to work with. This checklist shows some things the Scrum Master can be working on each day with and around the team: <http://scrummasterchecklist.org/pdf/ScrumMaster_Checklist_12_unbranded.pdf>\n\nThe checklist is by no means comprehensive, but gives a taste of the many things a scrum master can be doing to help the team."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Scrum Master is working with a team that has been practicing Scrum for several years. The team members are confident in their understanding of Scrum principles and have started to innovate beyond the basic framework. According to the Shu-Ha-Ri model of team maturity, at which level is this team operating, and what should be the primary focus of the Scrum Master?\n\nA) Shu level - The Scrum Master should focus on reinforcing the basic rules and practices of Scrum to maintain discipline.\n\nB) Ha level - The Scrum Master should help the team structure experiments to bend and expand Scrum rules to fit their needs.\n\nC) Ri level - The Scrum Master should act as a pure coach, stimulating and encouraging the team's innovative thinking.\n\nD) Post-Ri level - The Scrum Master's role is no longer needed, and they should step back from the team entirely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question describes a team that has been practicing Scrum for years and is now innovating beyond the basic framework.

The real address of a Unix socket is the `device,inode` number tuple, **not the pathname**. If a socket file is *moved*, whichever server was listening on it will be accessible via the new path. If a socket file is *removed*, another server can listen on the same path (that's why the directory permissions of a Unix socket are important, security\\-wise). `lsof` isn't able to cope with that, and may return incomplete / incorrect data.\n2. `ss` is itself buggy, and because the `unix_diag` netlink interface `ss` is using returns the device number in the format internally used by the Linux kernel, but `ss` assumes that it's in the format used by system calls interfaces like `stat(2)`, the `dev:` entry in the `ss -elx` output above will be manged. However, de\\-mangling it may be unwise, because one day they may just decide to fix it. So, the only course of action is to treat `dev:` as pure garbage, and live with the risk of having two socket files with the same inode, but on different filesystems, **which the test above is not able to handle**.\n\n---\n\nIf all of the above doesn't matter for you, you can do the same lousy thing `lsof` does (matching on the path the socket was first bound to), with:\n\n```\nsock=/path/to/socket\nss -elx | grep \" $sock \"\n\n```\n\nwhich should also work on older systems like Centos 7\\.

The documentation emphasizes that the real address of a Unix socket is the device,inode number tuple, not the pathname. This makes the device and inode number combination the most reliable identifier for a Unix socket. The `ss` command, particularly with the `-elx` options, can effectively monitor these connections by matching the inode number.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the pathname can be misleading if the socket file is moved or removed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because `lsof` is mentioned as potentially returning incomplete or incorrect data, especially when socket files have been moved.\n\nOption D is partially correct in that it uses `ss`, but it relies on the pathname, which is not as reliable as the inode number.

This feature gives users the ability to use data in EU countries while keeping data roaming disabled in other parts of the world.
