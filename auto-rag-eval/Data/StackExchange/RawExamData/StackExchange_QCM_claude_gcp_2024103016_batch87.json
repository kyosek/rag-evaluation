The moment problem is the problem of determining the probability density of a random variable in terms of its moments, as well as the uniqueness of such a density given by the moments.\nI have read this from the *Algebraic Combinatorics and Computer Science* of H. Crapo and D. Senato:\n\n> \"In the first half of this century, the method of moments was replaced by Paul Levy by a more pliable method relying upon the characteristic function $\\\\mathbb{E}(\\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\mathrm{i}tX })$, which is used to this day to derive the limit theorems of probability in their sharpest form. There is however one drawback to the characteristic function: it has no obvious probabilistic significance. My teacher William Feller was aware that the religious invocation of characteristic functions is extraneous to probabilistic reasoning. He managed to avoid characteristic functions in his treatise on probability. To be sure, characteristic functions made an occasional appearance in the second volume, when he just could not do without them. However, it was his intention to write a third volume, dealing with Brownian motion and diffusion processes, in which characteristic functions would be relegated to the dustbin of history. Unfortunately, he died before he could accomplish this task.\"\n\nOther important objects that can better represent many properties of random variables than moments are cumulants.\n\nFor $n\\\\geq 1$, we consider a vector of real\\-valued random variables $X\\_{\\[n]}\\= (X\\_1,\\\\ldots, X\\_n)$ such that $\\\\mathbb{E}(\\|X\\_j\\|^{n}) \\<\\\\infty, \\\\forall\\\\ j \\= 1,\\\\ldots,n$.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the continuity of f\u00b2(x) on [a,b]?\n\nA) f\u00b2(x) is always continuous on [a,b], and this can be proven without using the Boundedness Theorem.\n\nB) f\u00b2(x) is continuous on [a,b], but proving this requires using the Boundedness Theorem to establish an upper bound M for |f(x)| on [a,b].\n\nC) f\u00b2(x) may or may not be continuous on [a,b], depending on whether f(x) is bounded on the interval.\n\nD) f\u00b2(x) is continuous on [a,b], and this can be proven by choosing \u03b4 such that |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5/(2|f(y)|) for |x-y| < \u03b4, without needing the Boundedness Theorem.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. To prove that f\u00b2(x) is continuous on [a,b], we need to use the Boundedness Theorem, which states that a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded. This allows us to establish an upper bound M for |f(x)| on [a,b]. \n\nWe then choose \u03b4 > 0 such that for any x \u2208 [a,b] with |x-y| < \u03b4, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5/(2M). This choice of \u03b4 ensures that:\n\n|f\u00b2(x) - f\u00b2(y)| = |f(x) + f(y)| |f(x) - f(y)| \u2264 (|f(x)| + |f(y)|)|f(x) - f(y)| < (M + M) \u00b7 \u03b5/(2M) = \u03b5\n\nThis proves the continuity of f\u00b2(x) on [a,b].\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Boundedness Theorem is necessary for the proof. Option C is incorrect because f\u00b2(x) is always continuous if f(x) is continuous, regardless of boundedness. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the case where f(y) could be zero or very close to zero, which would make the proposed \u03b4 undefined or impractically small."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/04/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/91988", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/25198/"], "docs_id": 91988, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two raster datasets and I'm trying to determine the extent of their spatial relationship.

The distance between each mass is $\\\\Delta x$ which we use to express the total length as $l\\=(n\\+1\\)\\\\Delta x$. The displacement from the equilibrium position is given by $\\\\phi(x,t)$. \n\nThe discrete Lagrangian in terms of the $i$th particle $\\\\mathscr L$ is composed as follows, \n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\mathscr L\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum \\_{i\\=1}^{n}m\\\\dot \\\\phi \\_i^2\\-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum ^n \\_{i\\=0}k(\\\\phi\\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)^2\n\\\\end{equation} \n\nAt this point we take the continuum limit such that the number of masses in the fixed length of rod tends to infinity and correspondingly the inter\\-particle distance tends to zero. It is fruitful to multiply top and bottom by $\\\\Delta x$ such that we can define two quantities that remain constant during this limit namely the linear density ($\\\\mu\\=m/\\\\Delta x$) and the elastic modulus ($\\\\kappa\\=k\\\\Delta x$).\n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\mathscr L\\=\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\sum \\_{i\\=1}^{n}\\\\Delta x\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\bigg)\\\\dot {\\\\phi} \\_i^2\\-\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\sum \\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\Delta x(k\\\\Delta x)\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\bigg)^2\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nIt is easy to see why the linear density remains constant since both the number of masses per unit length increases while simultaneously the unit length decreases. \n\nHowever my question is regarding the elastic modulus, I fail to see how it remains constant in this limit.\n\nThe argument goes as follows; \nSince the extension of the rod per unit length is directly proportional to the force exerted on the rod the elastic modulus being the constant of proportionality. The force between two discreet particles is $F\\_i\\=k(\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)$, the extension of the inter particle spacing per unit length is $(\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)/\\\\Delta x$. Therefore (HOW) $\\\\kappa\\=k\\\\Delta x$ is constant. Its easy to relate them but why is it constant!?! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Honestly, I think this is one of those cases where you should just accept it and push on. This 'derivation' is really nothing more than a pedagogical device to make field theory seem somewhat natural to students with a background in classical mechanics. \n\nWhat we are trying to do is to take the continuum i.e. $N\\\\to \\\\infty$ limit of the following Lagrangian: \n\n$$L\\_N\\=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Biggl(\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^N\\\\Delta x \\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\dot{\\\\phi\\_i}^2\\-\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N\\-1}\\\\Delta x\\\\ k\\\\Delta x \\\\biggl\\[\\\\frac{\\\\phi\\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi\\_i}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\biggr]^2\\\\Biggr) $$\n\ndefine $\\\\mu\\=\\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x}$ and $Y\\=k\\\\Delta x$\n\nClearly, for a continuum limit, we get infinitely many particles, so the total kinetic energy of the system *should* diverge... unless we impose (or put in by hand, as they call it), that $\\\\mu$ remains constant, not $m$. Similarly, it is obvious that the equilibrium force of each spring $F\\=k \\\\Delta x$ *should* vanish... unless we impose that $k\\\\Delta x$ is constant when we take our limit. With these ad\\-hoc assumptions, and replacing the discrete index $i$ with a continuous spatial coordinate, we get \n\n$$L\\\\equiv \\\\lim\\_{N\\\\to \\\\infty}L\\_N\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\biggl(\\\\mu\\\\dot \\\\phi^2 \\-Y(\\\\nabla\\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr)$$\nThis gives us the right action for a free, massless, scalar field\n\\\\begin{align\\*}S\\[\\\\phi]\\&\\=\\-\\\\frac{Y}{2}\\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\biggl(\\-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{Y}\\\\dot \\\\phi^2\\+(\\\\nabla \\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\-\\\\frac{\\\\mu c^2}{2} \\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\biggl(\\-\\\\frac{1}{c^2}(\\\\partial\\_t\\\\phi)^2\\+(\\\\nabla\\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr) \\\\hspace{2cm}c\\=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{Y}{\\\\mu}}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\-\\\\mu c^2\\\\int\\_0^l\\\\mathrm{d}^2x\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\eta^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\phi\\\\partial\\_\\\\nu\\\\phi\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nThe definition of $c$ is the standard one for the speed of longitudinal waves, and as one can see this Lagrangian is also reminiscent of the action for a relativistic point particle (especially the prefactor). This is, of course, a very nice result, so we can be happy about the way we took our limit, even if we had to make some ad\\-hoc assumptions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the continuum limit of a linear elastic rod model, what is the correct interpretation of the elastic modulus \u03ba = k\u0394x?\n\nA) It represents the total spring constant of the system as the number of masses approaches infinity.\nB) It is a constant quantity that relates the force between particles to the extension per unit length in the continuum limit.\nC) It is equivalent to Young's modulus and remains constant as \u0394x approaches zero.\nD) It represents the energy stored in each spring as the inter-particle distance approaches zero.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The elastic modulus \u03ba = k\u0394x is a constant quantity in the continuum limit that relates the force between particles to the extension per unit length. As we take the limit where the number of masses tends to infinity and the inter-particle distance \u0394x tends to zero, \u03ba remains constant.

The question you should be asking is \"*how can I make this code's appearance match its semantics?*\" This code should be:\n\n```\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile())\n    DoWork(record);\n\n```\n\nNow the code reads like its intention. **Separate your mechanisms from your semantics**. In your original code you mix up the mechanism \\-\\- the details of the loop \\-\\- with the semantics \\-\\- the work done to each record.\n\nNow we have to implement `RecordsFromFile()`. What's the best way of implementing that? **Who cares?** That's not the code that anyone is going to be looking at. It's basic mechanism code and its ten lines long. Write it however you want. How about this?\n\n```\npublic IEnumerable<Record> RecordsFromFile()\n{\n    int offset = 0;\n    while(true)\n    {\n        Record record = Read(offset);\n        if (record == null) yield break;\n        yield return record;\n        offset += 1;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow that we are manipulating a *lazily computed sequence of records* all sorts of scenarios become possible:\n\n```\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().Take(10))\n    DoWork(record);\n\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().OrderBy(r=>r.LastName))\n    DoWork(record);\n\nforeach(Record record in RecordsFromFile().Where(r=>r.City == \"London\")\n    DoWork(record);\n\n```\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAny time you write a loop, ask yourself \"does this loop read like a mechanism or like the meaning of the code?\" If the answer is \"like a mechanism\", then try to move that mechanism to its own method, and write the code to make the meaning more visible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer is tasked with refactoring a loop that reads records from a file.

Not to say there is any merit in this; I was just fooling around with the identity to see if maybe it was adjustable to a true identity somehow.\n\nAnother note: The identity could be \"rescued\" as\n$$\\\\sin(2x)\\-\\\\tan(2x)\\=\\-2(\\\\sin x)^2 \\\\tan (2x).$$ With the common notation $\\\\sin^2 x$ for the square of the sine, this means OP may have just been inexact on putting the exponent there, but it still needs that extra factor of $2\\.$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the identity sin(2x) - tan(2x) = -sin(2x)tan(2x) is correct?\n\nA) The identity is true for all values of x.\nB) The identity is false, but can be made true by adding a factor of 2 and squaring sin(2x) on the right side.\nC) The identity is true only for x = \u03c0/6.\nD) The identity is false for all values of x.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe original identity sin(2x) - tan(2x) = -sin(2x)tan(2x) is false.

Does not seem so to me since the motor driver is so large, but I admit I am inexperienced in this area.\n\nWhat are other options without using a printed PCB?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absolutely, yes. But you'll need a frontend.\n\nAn EKG is usually just an instrumentation amplifier or a multistage amplifier with as many dB of common mode rejection as you can get.\n\nThe problem is that people are bags of electrolyte\\-rich fluids and meat with that right combination of resistance on the outside (skin) and relatively lower impedance to AC signals that all sorts of radiated EMI couples into our skin all the time.\n\nIf you've ever accidentally touched the tip of a speaker jack with your finger, or heck, just try probing your finger with your oscilloscope (isn't that the first thing one does with a new scope? I know it is for me!), you'll see what I mean. There is probably a volt or 2 of 50Hz or 60Hz ripple just from the wiring in your house.\n\nThis presents a problem when trying to detect electrical signals originating deep inside the skin\\-enclosed meat sack with all that noise coupling right at the surface trying to drown it out.\n\nWhere that noisy garbage coupling into your skin is on the order of a volt or two, the signals from your heart (at the point of detection on your skin at least) are about 1mV peak to peak. To get a good waveform, you'll want to be able to clearly see peaks as low as 20\u00b5V.\n\nSo you can't use an oscilloscope unaided, you can certainly use one as a very effective ECG/EKG with a front\\-end.\n\nSuch a front\\-end is not particularly difficult to make. The bandwidth and frequency of signals from the human heart are... quite slow in the context of analog electronics. This makes a frontend particularly forgiving, and you can even build one on a breadboard with just one IC.\n\nEssentially, it all boils down to two things: You need a lot of gain, and a lot of common mode rejection.\n\nCommon mode rejection is achieved by, at the simplest, coupling the op amp's ground reference to your own body through a low (but not too low) resistor, like 100\u03a9. This is the lead that tends to connect far away from your chest, like at the angle or leg. This ensures only the noise gets picked up and rejected as common mode, leaving the cardiac signal (which are far too weak to matter that far away in your ankle or where ever).\n\nA higher performance way of achieving this is to actually use a second op amp to drive the ground reference (your skin) and actively cancel out most of the common mode noise.\n\nIf you search for 'ECG frontend circuit', you'll find quite a few complete schematics of varying simplicity or complexity.\n\nAny of them can work, but it ultimately depends on what level of performance is acceptable.\n\nI have personally made this one, and a different similar one that also used a right leg driver that I can't seem to find, and both exceeded my expectations. They worked quite well:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBQHF.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBQHF.png)\n\n**Safety Note**\n\nDo not attach anything connected to your body like this to an oscilloscope that plugs directly into the wall. You ***must*** use an isolation transformer to fully isolate the oscilloscope so no ground path can be taken through you (and probably the electrical conduction system of your heart). Real ECGs are fully isolated if they plug into the wall at all.\n\n**Final note: Your body doesn't run on electric currents.**\n\nIt runs on ionic current. Electric current has electrons as the charge carriers making up that current, but inside your body, it is positive ions rather than electrons that flow and do things like make your muscles move.\n\nFor that reason, you need to use some sort of electrolyte between an electrode and your skin, forming a half cell and allowing the ionic currents to be converted into electric currents for use with your ECG frontend.\n\nBuying proper medical electrodes is ideal, but I can personally attest that tinfoil with some shampoo smeared on it can work in a pinch if you are really impatient to test what you made. Your results may vary.\n\nUse an isolation transformer and don't get hurt or killed accidentally. Beyond that, this is actually a great project that isn't too hard or expensive to build if you're sufficiently interested and motivated.

Based on my results below this appears to be in order of innermost to outermost with exterior rings being listed before the interior rings within them.\n\nAdditionally interior rings (green lines) are always within exterior rings (red lines). It is possible to have rings that overlap each other, self\\-intersections, etc., but typically these are considered topologically incorrect and are [simplified](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/index.html#//002m000003w0000000) before they are stored.\n\n**Another important point is the distinction between parts and rings.** A feature can have multiple parts, and a part can have multiple rings. In the picture below, think of each solid red shape as an individual part, each having a single exterior ring and 0, 1, or more inner rings.\n\n[![Polygons with multiple nested ring levels](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYUDs.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYUDs.gif)  \n\n(source: [arcgis.com](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/bitmaps/GeomPolygons.gif)) \n\n**For each part, the first ring is the outer ring, while all subsequent rings are inner rings.** The vertices of outer rings are oriented in a clockwise fashion while inner rings are oriented counter\\-clockwise.\n\n**Now to get practical:**\n\nYou can use the [geometry objects](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//002z0000001s000000) in arcpy to access the parts, rings, and vertices of a feature. There is a null point between the rings of a part. You could iterate over the parts and points, checking for the null point to see if there are interior rings.\n\nSee the Python script below. This defines a [generator function](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) to list the X, Y, FID, part, ring, and vertex indexes which is called repeatedly within a [SearchCursor](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//000v00000039000000) to write to a CSV file using the [`csv`](http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html) module.\n\nThe FID, part, and ring indices uniquely identify each ring, and you know that if the ring index is 0 it's an exterior ring. If the ring index is greater than 0, it's an interior ring.

According to the documentation, for each part of a polygon feature, the first ring is indeed the outer ring, while all subsequent rings are inner rings. This ordering is based on the containment relationship of the rings.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it reverses the order - the first ring is actually the outer ring, not an inner ring.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it states the orientation backwards. The documentation specifies that outer rings are oriented clockwise, while inner rings are oriented counter-clockwise.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the rings of a topologically correct polygon are not randomly ordered.

This is because a FeatureSet is a collection of Graphic objects, and each Graphic object has an associated Geometry. When converting a DataTable to a FeatureSet, the geometry information is not automatically considered, causing the geometry to be lost.

The documentation shows that for a closed random walk of length 2n on \u2124, the support is still \u0398(\u221an) with high probability, just as in the unconditioned case.

Option A is insufficient as it's only rated for up to 75,000 BTU/hr. Option B is also insufficient as its maximum flow rate of 100,000 BTU/hr is below the heater's requirement. Option D is incorrect as a high-pressure regulator would exceed the required pressure range.

\"bastion\" server. You cannot verify it, when the connection is created using `ProxyCommand` directive.\n\nAs you are using OpenSSH 8\\.1, you can use [`-J` (jump) switch](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh#J), instead of `ProxyCommand` directive:\n\n```\nssh -i remote.pem -i bastion.pem -J user@bastion user@remote\n\n```\n\nSee also [Does OpenSSH support multihop login?](https://superuser.com/q/1488097/213663)\n\nWith the `-J` switch, you should get a normal host key verification prompt.\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, first connect to the \"bastion\" only to verify its host key:\n\n```\nssh user@bastion\n\n```\n\n---\n\nAs you use `ssh` in some isolated non\\-interactive environment, you will have to copy the `known_hosts` file created by the above commands to that environment.\n\nOr use some techniques hinted in [ssh command line specify server host key fingerprint](https://serverfault.com/q/678035/168875)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given SSH documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to connect to a remote host through a bastion (jump) host using SSH, you encounter a \"Host key verification failed\" error.

Using the -J (jump) switch is a more modern and straightforward approach in OpenSSH 8.1 and later versions. It allows for a normal host key verification prompt, solving the \"Host key verification failed\" error without compromising security.\n\nC) Disabling host key checking is not recommended as it reduces security and doesn't address the root cause of the issue.\n\nD) Manually adding the key using ssh-keyscan is a possible solution but requires additional steps and may not be as user-friendly as using the -J switch.\n\nThe -J switch allows for a simpler command structure and handles the host key verification process more smoothly, making it the most appropriate solution for this scenario."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/17", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/36954", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/1984/"], "docs_id": 36954, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to have a field with autonumbering in ArcGIS. \n\nI have a versioned ArcSDE for SQL Server geodatabase. \n\nThus, using the identity seed attribute in the SQL Server is not an option. \n\nIs it not possible to autonumber your own columns in ArcSDE?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Classic problem :(\n\nI can give you a db\\-specific solution:\n\n* [Create a Sequence](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff878091.aspx) in your db\n* [Listen to the OnCreate event](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/conceptualhelp/index.html#//0001000001z5000000) and assign a value from the sequence by querying through the [SQL cursor interface](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/index.html#/OpenQueryCursor_Method/002500000861000000/).\n\nThe downside of this approach is that if rows get created in child versions and subsequently not posted, you will have gaps in the numbers.

The setup described (using a half-wave plate, quarter-wave plate, and polarized beam splitter) may not be sufficient to distinguish between circular and elliptical polarization. This is because the power measurements taken are likely time-averaged, which can mask the temporal variations in power that might occur with elliptical polarization. Constant power readings in this setup do not definitively prove circular polarization, as both circular and certain elliptical polarizations could potentially yield similar results in time-averaged measurements.

In a MAUI Blazor hybrid app, you cannot directly use MAUI components (XAML) inside Blazor pages. However, you can create a XAML view that contains both a BlazorWebView and other MAUI elements. This allows you to overlay MAUI components on top of your Blazor content when needed.\n\nAdditionally, to enable communication between the MAUI and Blazor parts of your application, you can use dependency injection to share a common object.

If so, as a physicist, I would appreciate providing some explanations using the, possibly, simplest example, a circle $S^2$.\n\nHere are my thoughts. Generally, for a manifold $\\\\mathcal M$, I see no problem in defining some 'distribution' $f(x)$ with $x\\\\in\\\\mathcal M$, such that ${\\\\int\\_{\\\\mathcal M} f(x)d\\\\mu(x)\\=}1$. Obviously, this definition is metric\\-dependent. Still, oftentimes we have a canonical definition of the metric, e.g. borrowed from $\\\\mathbb R^n$ in the case if some canonical embedding is given, which is often the case.\nHowever, we face serious difficulties when try to define 'averaged' quantities. (And in physics that's what we typically want to do).\n\nAssume, given some 'distribution' $f(\\\\vec{n})$, we want to calculate its mean value. One option would be to define it as follows:\n$$\n\\\\langle \\\\vec n \\\\rangle \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds}{\\\\left\\|\\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds\\\\right\\|^2}\n$$\n\nThe good thing about this definition is that it gives somewhat expected results, especially in the case of sharply\\-peaked distributions. However, we immediately face a huge number of problems. First of all, there exist a wide range of 'distributions' for which $\\\\langle\\\\vec n\\\\rangle$ is undefined (all the shells whose center of mass is at the origin). Second, excluding such 'bad' 'distributions' from the consideration does not really save us, for such an exclusion may be be 'quantity'\\-dependent (were we averaging not $\\\\vec n$ but smth else, we would have to exclude other distributions). Moreover, even if we exclude all the 'bad' ones (for a particular quantity of interest), we still cannot even define the sum for the remaining 'good' ones, for, again, the sum of 'good' distributions may be a 'bad' one.\n\nOK, let's now consider a totally different approach suggested by the discrete probability theory. What is the mean value for the random variable which in a half cases gives $\\-1$, and in another half \\- $\\+1$? Well, clearly it's $0$, you would say. But wait, in terms of a 'discrete guy' who only deals with two objects in the universe, $\\-1$ and $\\+1$, this does not make any sense. There's no such object as $0$ in his universe. Nonetheless, this definition oftentimes makes sense. Why? Because we know that both $\\-1$ and $\\+1$ have a natural inclusion into $\\\\mathbb R^n$ where the mean value can be defined. Let us stop for a second and appreciate this fact \\- we allowed the 'mean' value of a distribution defined on the the set $\\\\mathcal S\\=\\\\{\\-1,\\+1\\\\}$ to take values on a different set $\\\\mathcal{S}' \\= \\[\\-1,1]$. (On the contrary, as of 03/2019, the canonical way of embedding heads and tails into $\\\\mathbb R^n$ is still not known, and, so, their mean value does not make much sense.)\n\nGeneralising this procedure to our example is straightforward:\n$$\n\\\\langle \\\\vec n \\\\rangle \\= \\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds\n$$\nWhich basically gives us a mean value of a distribution defined on $\\\\mathcal S'$ (again, by inclusion). An obvious downside \\- the averaged quantities have now no meaning for inhabitants of the $\\\\mathcal S$ manifold.\n\nIs any of these approaches dominant? Or maybe smth else? Is there a theory for general, more complicated manifolds?\nAny comments and /simple/ references are welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The theoretical underpinnings of probability are simple \\- a probability distribution is simply a (nonnegative) measure defined on some $X$ such that the total measure of $X$ is $1$. That makes perfect sense on a manifold. There's no need for any special treatment.\n\nIf it's a smooth oriented $n$\\-manifold, we can use that smooth structure to define the density function for a \"continuous\" probability distribution \\- that density function is a nonnegative $n$\\-form with integral $1$. Compact Lie groups, and compact manifolds with a transitive Lie group action, even have a standard \"uniform\" distribution, invariant under that Lie group action.\n\nNow, you want to talk about expected values? We can set up those integrals $E(f)\\=\\\\int\\_{\\\\mathcal{M}} f(x)\\\\,d\\\\mu(x)$ with respect to the probability measure $\\\\mu$, but only as long as the function $f$ we're trying to find the expected value of takes values in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, or at least some normed vector space. The expected value is a weighted sum \\- we need to be able to add and take scalar multiples to make sense of it at all.  \n\nThat's the same normed vector space everywhere \\- something like a function from points on the manifold to vectors in the tangent space at those points isn't going to work (unless we embed everything into $\\\\mathbb{R}^m$, standardizing the tangent spaces as subspaces of that).\n\nSo then, the expected value of the position function doesn't make sense (usually). The manifold isn't a normed vector space, after all. It doesn't have an addition operation \\- why would we ever be able to add things up on it anyway?. On the other hand, with a particular embedding of the manifold into $\\\\mathbb{R}^m$, we can take an expected value of that. The uniform distribution on the sphere $S^2$, with the standard embedding into $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ as $\\\\{(x,y,z): x^2\\+y^2\\+z^2\\=1\\\\}$, has an expected value of $(0,0,0\\)$.
