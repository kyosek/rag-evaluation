What this means is it's one large partition that within it can be placed multiple 'logical' partitions \\- in this case, `/dev/sda2` is an extended partition that fills the rest of your disk after the first partition `/dev/sda1`, and within `/dev/sda2` your swap partition exists as `/dev/sda5`.\n\nTo extend your `/dev/sda1` you need to do the following first:\n\n1. Disable your swap partition. `sudo swapoff /dev/sda5`\n2. Using `gparted`, shrink `/dev/sda2` so it contains *only* `/dev/sda5` and no free space.\n3. Using `gparted`, move `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda5` together to the end of the disk.\n4. Resize (grow) your `/dev/sda1` after the previous tasks are completed.\n5. Reenable your swap partition. `sudo swapon /dev/sda5`\n\nAlternatively, you can do the following instead, which gets you more in line with what modern Ubuntu does (which is to use **swapfiles** instead of swap *partitions*):\n\n1. Disable your swap partition. `sudo swapoff /dev/sda5`\n2. **Delete** both partition 5 and Partition 2 via `parted`\n3. Grow your `/dev/sda1` and its filesystem.\n4. Use a swapfile instead of a swap partition, from within your single partition.\n\n```\nsudo fallocate -l 4GiB /swapfile\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n\n```\n5. Once the swapfile is created, add this to `/etc/fstab` on the end of the line so that the swapfile is enabled automatically at boot time:\n\n```\n/swapfile    swap    swap    sw    0    0\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is trying to expand the root partition (/dev/sda1) on a Linux system with the following partition structure:\n- /dev/sda1: 30.1GB (primary, ext4, boot)\n- /dev/sda2: 9.9GB (extended)\n- /dev/sda5: 4.3GB (logical, linux-swap)\n\nWhat is the correct sequence of steps to safely expand the root partition while maintaining the swap functionality?\n\nA) 1.

It involves disabling swap, using gparted to manipulate the partitions without data loss, and then re-enabling swap. This method doesn't require creating new partitions or using advanced features like LVM, making it suitable for the given scenario.\n\nOption A, while valid, involves more drastic changes by deleting partitions and creating a swap file, which may not be necessary if the existing structure works well.\n\nOption C is incorrect because directly resizing /dev/sda1 without first moving the other partitions would cause conflicts.\n\nOption D introduces unnecessary complexity by involving LVM, which isn't mentioned in the original system configuration."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/29", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/132303", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/25708/"], "docs_id": 132303, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an early '13 MBP running Mavericks.

What is the correct value and what is the reason why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Do you have Time Machine backups turned on? If so, the difference may be due to space used for [\"local snapshots\"](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878) (essentially, backups to the local disk when your real backup disk is not available). Local snapshots are automatically deleted when the space is needed for something else (actually, it starts purging them when the volume reaches 80% full), so the Finder treats them as free space. `du`, on the other hand, sees them as used space (as do Disk Utility and System Information).\n\nTo find out if this is what's going on, take a look in System Information: From the Apple Menu, choose \"About This Mac\", then click \"More Info\", then select the Storage tab, and look for a light purple (\"Backups\") band on the usage chart. If it's around 47GB, this is the source of the difference.\n\nIf you want to disable this feature, you can use the Terminal command `sudo tmutil disablelocal` \\-\\- but I recommend leaving it enabled, as it does provide some useful protection against accidental deletion/file damage/etc when your real backup is not available.\n\nEDIT: As @chillin pointed out, there's an additional source of confusion: `df` and the Finder are using different units to report the sizes. `df` is using Gibibytes (\\=1,073,741,824 bytes), while the Finder is using Gigabytes (\\=1,000,000,000 bytes). If the Finder had reported in GiB, it would've said Capacity: 232\\.96 GiB, Available: 166\\.41 GiB, Used: 66\\.55 GiB. So there was actually about 52 GiB used for the local snapshots."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user with a MacBook Pro running macOS Mavericks notices a discrepancy between the available disk space reported by the terminal command `df -h` and the Finder's \"Get Info\" window. What are the most likely reasons for this difference?\n\nA) The Finder is incorrectly calculating available space due to a software bug\nB) Time Machine local snapshots and different units of measurement (GiB vs GB)\nC) The external SSD is interfering with accurate disk space reporting\nD) The user's virtual machines are causing disk space to be misreported\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The discrepancy is most likely due to two main factors:\n\n1. Time Machine local snapshots: These backups are stored on the local disk when the backup drive is unavailable. The Finder treats this space as free since it can be automatically deleted when needed, while `df` sees it as used space.\n\n2. Different units of measurement: The `df` command uses Gibibytes (GiB), where 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes, while the Finder uses Gigabytes (GB), where 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes. This difference in units contributes to the apparent discrepancy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not a software bug, but rather an intentional design choice in how space is reported.\nOption C is incorrect as the external SSD is not causing the reporting discrepancy on the internal drive.\nOption D is incorrect because while virtual machines can use significant disk space, they are not the cause of the reporting difference between `df` and Finder."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/09", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/297666", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1186/"], "docs_id": 297666, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wonder whether dark energy can be used for interstellar propulsion?

The documentation suggests that to effectively use dark energy for propulsion, you would need to work at galactic scales due to the extremely weak nature of dark energy effects at smaller distances. The answer also correctly mentions the possibility of using a magnetic induction system to extract energy from the expansion of space, which is consistent with the equation and explanation provided in the documentation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a few light-years would not be sufficient distance for dark energy effects to be significant. \n\nOption B misunderstands the nature of dark energy, which expands space in all directions, not pushing objects in a specific direction. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it falsely states that dark energy force is inversely proportional to mass, when in fact the force is proportional to mass according to the documentation."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/30", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/194705", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/80300/"], "docs_id": 194705, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do I take words which I can not find in Google.

It even describes Lyme Bay as \"*that largest **bite** from the underside of England\u2019s outstretched southwestern leg*\" So, \"inbite\" apparently refers to the bay. As a coastal bay is a recess in the coastline, it would seem as if a \"bite\" has been taken out of the land. This is further evidenced by the fact that the text goes on to say that Lyme Regis is *eponymous* with the aforementioned Lyme Bay \\- obviously the bay takes its name from the inland area nearby.\n\nAdmittedly I have never heard this word used before \\- unless someone can show evidence of it being commonly used to describe a bay like this I would suggest that the author creatively made a compound word of \"in\" and \"bite\" and then used this as a metaphor to describe the shape of the coastline. Don't be surprised that it isn't found in dictionaries \\- English is very fluid in the way it allows for compound words to be used colloquially. For example, in the region of England in which I live many people refer to an alleyway between two roads as a \"cut\\-through\", yet I can't find this in any dictionary either.\n\nThe definite article \"the\" is used because, having established that the subject is Lime Bay, it is a *specific* subject. If the author had not been so creative and simply referred to it as what it is \\- *a bay* \\- he would still have written \"*the* bay\" because to use the indefinite article \"*a* bay\" could refer to any bay.

Once i start an application (e.g. terminal emulator by pressing `Mod + Shift + Return`) the application uses the entire screen, as if the `xmobar` was at the bottom. Then i press `Mod + B` and nothing happens, once i press `Mod + B` a second time `xmobar` is lifted to the top reducing the application window size.\n\nAfter that `Mod + B` works correctly for the remainder of the `xmonad` session, i.e. it lowers/raises (hides/shows) the `xmobar`.\n\nI'm confident i misconfigured something.

The problem is that `statusBar` does not register the events of `Hooks.manageDocks` properly. Once `xmonad` is running all works well because `manageDocks` is able to update the `Struts` on every window event. But in the moment that `xmonad` is starting the event of making the first windows fullscreen happens before the events from `manageDocks`. This mages that first open window to ignore the existence of `xmobar`.\n\n`manageDocks` has its event handler that **must** be set as the last event handler, therefore `statusBar` cannot be used. Instead, it is necessary to make `xmonad` call and configure `xmobar` manually through `dynamicLog`, `manageHook`, `layoutHook` and `handleEventHook`. A minimalistic configuration for this would be:\n\n```\nmain = do\n    xmproc <- spawnPipe \"xmobar\"\n    xmonad $ defaultConfig\n      { modMask            = mod4Mask\n      , manageHook         = manageDocks <+> manageHook defaultConfig\n      , layoutHook         = avoidStruts  $ layoutHook defaultConfig\n      -- this must be in this order, docksEventHook must be last\n      , handleEventHook    = handleEventHook defaultConfig <+> docksEventHook\n      , logHook            = dynamicLogWithPP xmobarPP\n          { ppOutput          = hPutStrLn xmproc\n          , ppTitle           = xmobarColor \"darkgreen\"  \"\" . shorten 20\n          , ppHiddenNoWindows = xmobarColor \"grey\" \"\"\n          }\n      , startupHook        = setWMName \"LG3D\"\n      } `additionalKeys`\n      [ ((mod4Mask, xK_b), sendMessage ToggleStruts) ]\n\n```\n\nThis makes all events to be processed by `docsEventHook` and ensures that layout changes made by `docsEventHook` are the last ones applied. Now\n\n```\nlowerOnStart = False\n\n```\n\n(or `True`) works as expected *in all cases* within `xmobarrc`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided XMonad and xmobar configuration information:\n\nQuestion: In an XMonad configuration using xmobar, what is the primary reason for the initial incorrect behavior of xmobar, where it doesn't appear at the top or bottom of the window stack until after certain user actions?\n\nA) The lowerOnStart and hideOnStart settings in .xmobarrc are incorrectly configured\nB) The statusBar function in xmonad.hs is not properly handling xmobar's initialization\nC) The manageDocks hook is not registered early enough in the XMonad startup process\nD) The .xinitrc file is not correctly launching XMonad with the proper environment variables\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The core issue lies in the timing of event handling during XMonad's startup. The manageDocks hook, which is responsible for properly handling xmobar's position and visibility, is not registered early enough in the startup process. This causes the first window to be opened in fullscreen mode, ignoring xmobar's existence.\n\nThe statusBar function, while convenient, doesn't properly register the events from Hooks.manageDocks at startup. To resolve this, it's necessary to manually configure XMonad to use xmobar through dynamicLog, manageHook, layoutHook, and handleEventHook. Crucially, the docksEventHook must be set as the last event handler to ensure proper processing of all events related to xmobar's positioning and visibility.\n\nOptions A and D, while potentially impacting xmobar's behavior, are not the root cause of this specific issue.

If you're tempted to use the cursor keys directly in insert mode, maybe the mode switch is too cumbersome for you. This is especially true with the default location of the `Escape` key. Many users map it to left Control or Caps Lock because of that.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to your question, but the fact that you've asked this question means that there are some doubts on your side. In the end, only you can decide. Keep monitoring yourself, keep comparing and trying different approaches. For example, you could `:map` your cursor keys to `<Nop>` for one Vim session, to wean you off those keys. It might feel clumsy at first, but you need to find out how you'll feel about that at the end of a longer editing session.\n\nSome users are very strict about avoiding cursor keys, or even repetitive primitive motions (like `lllll...` or `jjj...`), and there are plugins that check on or disallow that. Personally, I think it's best to be pragmatic about it. For short tactical edits, I don't mind staying in insert mode and using the cursor keys, especially if I'm currently using other applications in parallel (which often enforce this style of editing). For longer edits that are purely in Vim, I usually exit insert mode often and quickly."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a Django blog application and want to restrict editing of blog posts to their respective owners. Which combination of approaches is most effective and follows Django best practices?\n\nA) Use a decorator like @login_required on the view function and raise a 404 error if the current user doesn't match the blog post owner.\n\nB) Implement the ownership check in the template using an if statement to conditionally display the edit link, and also add a server-side check in the view function.\n\nC) Create a custom template filter to check post ownership and use it to conditionally render the edit link, without any additional server-side checks.\n\nD) Modify the model to include a ManyToManyField for editors and check if the current user is in this field before allowing edits.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most comprehensive and secure approach. Implementing the ownership check in the template (as shown in the provided code) helps to hide the edit link from non-owners, improving the user interface. However, this client-side check alone is not sufficient for security. It's crucial to also implement a server-side check in the view function to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the edit functionality even if they manage to guess or construct the edit URL. This dual-layer approach provides both a good user experience and robust security.\n\nOption A is partially correct but raises a 404 error, which is not the best practice for this scenario. A 403 Forbidden would be more appropriate.\n\nOption C relies solely on template-level checks, which can be bypassed and is not secure.\n\nOption D introduces unnecessary complexity by modifying the model structure when a simple ownership check would suffice."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/01", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/174436", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/80682/"], "docs_id": 174436, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I started the quest \"Beyond Dead\" and talked to Valrice, then I went to kill one of the guys but died.

Set $address->setShippingMethod('freeshipping_freeshipping')\n\nA) 1, 3, and 6\nB) 2, 4, and 5\nC) 1, 4, and 6\nD) 2, 3, and 5\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct implementation involves using the 'sales_quote_collect_totals_before' event (2), which is more appropriate for this purpose than 'checkout_cart_update_items_after'. Setting $address->setFreeShipping(true) (4) is the correct way to enable free shipping, as the boolean value 'true' works properly, while '1' does not. Finally, modifying the collect() method in Mage_SalesRule_Model_Quote_Freeshipping (5) by commenting out the line that resets free shipping is necessary for this custom implementation to work correctly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the wrong event, sets the wrong value for free shipping, and unnecessarily sets a specific shipping method.\nOption C is incorrect for similar reasons to A, using the wrong event and unnecessarily setting a shipping method.\nOption D is incorrect because it uses the wrong value for setFreeShipping (1 instead of true)."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/01", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/265334", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/74199/"], "docs_id": 265334, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I performed a `sudo apt-get install ssh` on my home PC running Ubuntu.\n\nWhen I got to work, I tried to connect with just `ssh x.x.x.x` where that is my home IP address.\n\nThe connection is timing out over the internet, but when I was on that Ubuntu PC I connected to `ssh localhost` and it worked fine.\n\nDo I need to do something to my network or that box to allow outside connections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you use a home router solution, you'll need to forward incoming `TCP/22` to the ubuntu machine running SSH in order for the incoming connection to be properly forwarded to your linux box. This is usually labelled `port forwarding` or `port mapping` in your router's web interface. **However, this won't fix anything if your place of employment is blocking `TCP/22` outbound.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user has set up SSH on their home Ubuntu PC and wants to connect to it from work. They can connect locally using 'ssh localhost' but the connection times out when trying to connect from work using the home IP address. What is the most likely reason for this issue and what solution should be implemented?\n\nA) The SSH service is not running on the Ubuntu PC. The user should start the SSH service using 'sudo systemctl start ssh'.\n\nB) The user's work network is blocking outbound connections on TCP port 22. The user should ask their IT department to allow outbound connections on this port.\n\nC) The home router is not forwarding incoming connections on TCP port 22 to the Ubuntu PC. The user should set up port forwarding in their router's settings.\n\nD) The SSH configuration on the Ubuntu PC is set to only allow local connections. The user should edit the SSH config file to allow external connections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely reason for this issue is that the home router is not forwarding incoming connections on TCP port 22 (the default SSH port) to the Ubuntu PC. This explains why local connections work ('ssh localhost') but external connections time out. The solution is to set up port forwarding (also called port mapping) in the home router's settings to forward incoming TCP/22 traffic to the internal IP address of the Ubuntu PC. While option B (work network blocking outbound connections) is also mentioned as a possibility in the documentation, it's less likely to be the primary issue since the question states the connection is timing out, which typically happens when incoming connections are blocked or not forwarded correctly."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/07/04", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138628", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/164553/"], "docs_id": 138628, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I typed a numbered list which generated them in numerical order.

According to the documentation, nested lists already exist in StackExchange and are created by indenting the next level with four spaces. This method works for both bullet points (using '-') and numbered lists (using '1.'). \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because StackExchange does not automatically format numbered lists using '#' symbols. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because nested lists are not created using a combination of '*' and '#' symbols as suggested.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the default bullet point symbol in StackExchange is '-', not '*'.\n\nThe documentation provides examples of how to properly format nested lists using indentation, which is the key point that option C correctly identifies."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/15", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/315843", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/161213/"], "docs_id": 315843, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a bit confused how to use version control with Unity, especially with objects such as scenes or prefabs that are not just code. \n\nWe had an issue recently when my colleague and I were working on different parts of the same scene. which resulted in conflicts, branching and merging galore.\n\nIn the end my revision was overridden by his changes anyway. \n\nThe only way I see at the moment is us taking turns working on the same objects, but it doesn't seem very convenient, especially since all of the work we're currently doing is in the scenes. \n\nWhat do people usually do in these situations? \n\n(We're using Mercurial, BitBucket, and SourceTree.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can try following solution if you're using GitHub.\n\n1.

According to the documentation, to improve version control in Unity, especially for non-code assets, you should:\n\n1. Open Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor in Unity.\n2. Change \"Version control mode\" to \"Visible meta files\".\n3.

Visible meta files allow version control systems to track changes in Unity's metadata more effectively.\n2. Force text serialization converts Unity's assets into a text-based format, which is more git-friendly and allows for easier merging and conflict resolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because hidden meta files make version control more difficult, and mixed serialization doesn't fully solve the issue.\nOption B is incorrect because while visible meta files are good, force binary serialization would make merging and conflict resolution harder.\nOption D is incorrect because Perforce is a specific version control system, not a Unity setting, and \"Smart\" is not an option for asset serialization in Unity."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/12/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/363205", "https://magento.stackexchange.com",

In the given code, there's a section where $data is cast to an array and stored in $Ddata, but then $data is still used with array_key_last(). This is likely the source of the error.\n\nThe correct fix would be to use $Ddata instead of $data when calling array_key_last(), as $Ddata is guaranteed to be an array after the cast operation. This aligns with option D, which suggests using $Ddata instead of $data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the issue is not about initialization but about using the wrong variable.\nOption B is incorrect because array_key_last() is a valid PHP function, not deprecated.\nOption C describes the symptom of the error but not the cause or solution.\nOption D correctly identifies both the problem and the solution."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/15", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/189655", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/71274/"], "docs_id": 189655, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How to convert my points into a raster along the z attribute and a resolution of 5 minutes or 10 km\n\nFirst I import the data as a .txt file and then I convert to a vector (shapefile).\nthen I do: Raster\\> Conversion\\> rasterise (vector to raster). but the problem in the attribute fields I not find the z column, only the x, y coordinates.

This would allow me to remove the wall and not leave a big RSJ poking out of my garden or some other such thing. \n\nSo my other question is, would such a foundation be acceptable? Is their other longer fixings availiable that could take the place of using bolts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A welded connection can always be made the same strength as the original steel by using a full penetration but weld but this all depends on the quality of the materials used for the welding and the quality of the welding itself. Therei s a very good reason why there is a lot of non destructive testing used when welded joints are being used for structural reasons. Other types of welds such as fillet welds will be weaker than the origianl material with the strength depending on the quality and the design. \n\nFor a bolted connection, the connection will not normally be as strong as the original material without some form of strengthening because of issues like the reduction in area caused by drilling the holes and the small lever arms caused by overlapping plates. \n\nIn this instance, if you are not intending to get the design professionally done, I would suggest a bolted connection would be more suitable unless you have absolute confidence on the quality of the welding and the design of the joints. A simple bolted connection should give you more confidence about the strength than a welded joint even though the capacity of the connection may be lower."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is planning to build a 10-foot tall freestanding climbing wall using a mild steel subframe. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the construction and safety of this structure?\n\nA) Welded joints are always preferable to bolted joints for this type of structure, as they provide superior strength without the need for professional design or quality control.\n\nB) Bolted connections are recommended for this DIY project, as they offer more predictable strength and easier assembly, despite potentially having lower overall capacity than ideal welded joints.\n\nC) The climbing wall can be safely attached directly to a concrete base using standard bolts, without the need for additional foundation considerations or longer fixings.\n\nD) Full penetration butt welds will always result in joints as strong as the original steel, regardless of the welding materials or technique used.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. For a DIY project like this climbing wall, bolted connections are generally recommended over welded joints. While welded joints can potentially be stronger, their strength depends heavily on the quality of materials, welding technique, and proper design - factors that may be challenging to control in a non-professional setting. Bolted connections, while potentially having lower overall capacity, offer more predictable strength and easier assembly for a DIY builder. They also allow for easier disassembly if needed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because welded joints are not always preferable, especially for DIY projects, and they do require professional design and quality control for optimal strength.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the foundation for a freestanding structure like this requires careful consideration and may need more substantial anchoring than standard bolts directly into a concrete base.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while full penetration butt welds can theoretically be as strong as the original material, this depends on the quality of materials and welding technique, which are not guaranteed in all situations."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/20", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/560834", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/381246/"], "docs_id": 560834, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the [definition of \"deliberately\" in Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deliberately), the second meaning which is \"slowly and carefully\" has an example: Calmly and deliberately, she cut up his suits one by one.\n\nI don't understand the meaning of \"cut up\" and \"suits\" in this example sentence.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> \\**You know all you\u2019re getting off it then is maybe the CD\\-ROM which*\n> *surely that\u2019s not worth grabbing*.\n\nThe *basic* relative clause can be analysed as \"which is not worth grabbing\", where \"which\" is subject with \"CD\\-ROM\" as its antecedent.\n\nThe existence of an anaphoric link between \"which\" and \"CD\\-ROM means that it is not possible to have a further anaphoric element (\"that\") linked to the same antecedent, i.e. \"CD\\-ROM\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why it would be incorrect to say \"The CD-ROM which that surely is not worth grabbing\"?\n\nA) The word \"that\" is redundant and should always be omitted in relative clauses.\nB) The anaphoric link between \"which\" and \"CD-ROM\" precludes the use of another anaphoric element (\"that\") referring to the same antecedent.\nC) The phrase \"surely that's\" should be replaced with \"is surely\" for grammatical correctness.\nD) The word \"which\" should be replaced with \"that\" to form a proper relative clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because \"that\" is not always redundant in relative clauses and can be used in certain contexts.\nB is correct because it accurately describes the grammatical issue.

At the present time, however, the photon energy density has a much smaller effect than either dark energy or dark matter. This is due to the different ways in which the energy densities of the various components scale with the size of the universe. Dark matter energy density (unsurprisingly) scales like ordinary matter density\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\rho\\_{DM}\\\\propto a(t)^{\\-3}.\n\\\\end{equation}\nThat is, as the universe expands and the scale factor increases, the dark matter energy density decreases by three factors of scale, one for each spatial dimension.\n\nPhotons, however, in addition to having their density diluted by the expansion of space, are also redshifted, so that their energy density drops by an additional inverse scale factor\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\rho\\_{\\\\gamma}\\\\propto a(t)^{\\-4}.\n\\\\end{equation}\nLastly, we have dark energy, also referred to as the cosmological constant. It is constant with respect to scale factor. \n\nSo, we see that as time evolves and the scale factor increases, dark energy density is constant, dark matter density drops as $a(t)^{\\-3}$ and photon energy density drops like $a^{\\-4}$. This is the reason why we currently live in a period of accelerating expansion: radiation and dark matter density have been sufficiently diluted by expansion so that dark energy dominates. \n\nIt is important to note that the universe evolves differently during periods dominated by either radiation, dark matter or dark energy. Specifically, only dark energy can produce accelerated expansion. Radiation and dark matter both act to slow and eventually reverse expansion, albeit in quantitatively different manners.\n\nAt sufficiently early times, when $a(t)\\\\ll 1$, the photon density will be large compared to the dark matter density and dark energy density. During this radiation\\-dominated epoch, radiation energy density will drive scale factor evolution. \n\nThe graph below shows how the scale factor evolved in a universe like our own. Following an initial period of exponential expansion (inflation), the universe was radiation dominated, then matter\\-dominated, and finally dark energy\\-dominated. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXiov.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXiov.gif)\n\nFinally, a calculation of the present day photon energy density from the CMB temperature can be found in [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/94221/58448)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the evolution of the universe, which of the following statements is true regarding the energy densities of different components and their effects on cosmic expansion?\n\nA) The photon energy density currently has a greater effect on cosmic expansion than dark matter or dark energy.\n\nB) Dark matter energy density scales as a(t)^-4, where a(t) is the scale factor.\n\nC) During the radiation-dominated epoch, the universe experienced accelerated expansion.\n\nD) As the universe expands, dark energy density remains constant while photon energy density decreases more rapidly than dark matter density.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because currently, photon energy density has a much smaller effect on cosmic expansion compared to dark matter and dark energy.\n\nB is incorrect because dark matter energy density scales as a(t)^-3, not a(t)^-4.

But, put that aside for now, just know they don't really switch, but that in many my\\-first\\-schematic designs they can be seen as a switch because you are allowed to ignore the tiny bit of behaviour that makes it not exactly that.\n\nSo in the following we are going to assume the transistor actually is a switch, which switches the current path between its collector and emitter on when a current flows in the right direction through the base. Because I'm going to take some care in my images to make sure that assumption will work.\n\nA transistor:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oihob.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2foihob.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIt's a single NPN type transistor. There's two types: NPN and PNP, they work almost entirely the same, just the PNP has the currents flowing the other way around. Again, for now, ignore PNPs exist, no running before walking, we only know NPN.\n\nLet's make it do something: Let's let it control a LED. (feel free to go along with this, if you happen to have a bread\\-board handy, by the way).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1Sgr.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fG1Sgr.png)\n\nThe LED is pink, because pink LEDs are cool.\n\nNow, if the transistor turns on, the LED will turn on: In an NPN transistor no current is \"allowed\" to flow from the collector to the emitter if the base is not activated. If the base *is* activated, the current will be allowed to flow and the transistor would really like it if you designed it so the current goes from collector to emitter in an NPN type.\n\nHow do we activate the base? By forcing a little current into it. So, step one, let a human control the base:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyaex.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fKyaex.png)\n\nWhen you push the switch, the current goes from the \\+5V through R2 into the base of transistor Q1\\. Then the collector will allow current to flow to the emitter, because the LED will also want to conduct current in that direction, the LED will now turn on.\n\nNow, this is about where you get stuck: What if \"*I*\" don't want to push a button?\n\nWell.... we could have another transistor in there:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxas9.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fqxas9.png)\n\nBut... same difference! Now we just have another base to control!\n\nYes.\n\nBut;\n\nIt's already become more interesting! Imagine our switch back into that circuit, but now connected with another 10k resistor to the base of Q2\\. If you push the switch, Q2 will turn on, right? Right! Now, the base of the Q1 will be pulled to ground, because the Q2 will happily conduct enough current to have nearly all of the 5V fall across the R2\\. So Q1 will actually turn off. So when you push the button the LED goes off. If you release the button, Q2 will turn off. Which will let the current from R2 flow into the base of Q1 in stead of into the collector of Q2\\. Now Q1 will turn on and the LED will turn on.\n\nThis behaviour we summarise with the name \"Inverter\".\n\nWhat's more than 2 transistors? 3!\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXbKv.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fnXbKv.png)\n\nCan you see that when you push switch SW1, Q2 will turn on and everything will be as we said just now? Can you also see that the same will happen when you press SW2? SW2 turns on Q3, then Q3 pulls the current into its collector and it will not go into Q1, so Q1 will be off. If you push no switches, the current through R2 will be able to go into Q1 and turn it on. If you push both switches, Q2 and Q3 will find a way between them to share the current through R2 and again Q1 will go off.\n\nso if you press SW1 OR you press SW2 OR you press both, the LED will go off, else it will go on.\n\nIf you consider the LED's light as the output we call this an OR\\-gate with an inverting output.\n\nCan you see where this is going? If transistors can control each other when they are used as a switching element, we can start to build logic gates.\n\nIn the same way:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jvo4p.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fJvo4p.png)\n\nIs another type of logic gate.\n\nIf you press neither button, the LED will be on. If you press only SW1 the base of Q2 will want to take the current and Q2 will then want to conduct, but it cannot, because Q3 isn't conducting, so nothing happens.\n\nIf you press only SW2, the base of Q3 will be able to take some current, it will then allow current to go from its collector to the emitter, but Q2 is now turned off, so again, no current can flow and the resistor R2 keeps turning on Q1, so the LED stays on.\n\nIf you now press SW1 and SW2, both Q2 and Q3 will want to conduct, because there is no more obstruction, the current from R2 can flow through both Q2 and Q3 to ground and will not go into Q1's base, so Q1 will turn off.\n\nThis is called an AND\\-Gate with inverting output.\n\nNow we can start using the gates we just \"invented\" and several other ones to build other bigger blocks. We know how gates can work, so we can take it one step further. Imagine the switches are inputs and the LED is an actual electrical output and you pretty much have a working gate. In \"the real world\" they are designed much more efficiently for lower power, higher speed and such, but the idea in broad lines is the same.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A brushless DC motor uses transistors to control its operation.

At very low temperatures, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the crossover temperature where the electron contribution begins to dominate over the phonon contribution?\n\nA) The crossover temperature is typically around 100 K for most metals.\nB) The crossover temperature is generally above 10 K but below room temperature.\nC) The crossover temperature is usually below 10 K, closer to 4 K for most metals.\nD) The crossover temperature is highly variable and can range from 1 K to 300 K depending on the metal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the electron contribution to heat capacity dominates at very low temperatures. The specific example of copper (Cu), considered a good metal with potentially large electron contribution, shows that the vibrational energy (phonon contribution) is the major contributor above liquid-helium temperatures. Liquid helium temperature is about 4 K. The documentation states that \"under 10K, closer to 4K\" is where one would expect the electron contribution to become dominant. This holds true even for tungsten (W), which is not considered as good a conductor as copper. Therefore, the crossover temperature where electron contribution begins to dominate is typically below 10 K and closer to 4 K for most metals."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/09", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/41527", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3959/"], "docs_id": 41527, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some basic knowledge of English grammar (this is what I think!!!).

What are the 'red flags' you've come across (performance hogs, security risks, architectural bad practices)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here are some thoughts on evaluating 3rd Party Modules:\n\n**Basics:**\n\n* Current Magento Version Support \\- Does it support the latest version of Magento (including the current one we are developing it for)?\n\nIf a module does not support the latest release of Magento, it will probably be difficult to make it work without spending precious development time on it.\n* Support \\- Do the developers who created the module support the product?\n\nOne of the signs of a healthy module is that the developers actively support it. If they don't support it is a red flag, why won't they support the product if it's good? \n\nAdditionally, when a module is supported, we can usually get important info from the developers with a simple email (for example, does this module use jQuery or Prototype).\n* Reviews \\- What are other users saying? How was their experience?\n\nBy reading the reviews we can get a better sense of the big picture, is there a installation issue? Do the developers respond in a timely and helpful manner? Does it work as advertised?\n* Refund \\- Will they give you back your money if it doesn't work out as intended?\n\nMany times we want to try out the module so that we can test it, if it works and meets our specifications great! But if it doesn't, we want the option of returning it and getting a refund for it.\n\n**Intermediate:**\n\n* Class Overrides \\- Does the module override any core classes?\n\nGenerally speaking a good module should not override any core classes, rather it should use Observers.\n\nOne reason for this, is that it can make upgrading Magento difficult. Additionally, other modules might be depending on one output from a given function, and this module is providing a different one.\n\nSometimes this is not possible to do, if this is the case, there should be a very good reason why it is overriding a core class.\n* Layout updates \\- Does the module change some of my layout settings?\n\nSome modules change the layout settings to your site (for example: product page), make sure it doesn't break your current layout, and if it does what would be required (read: how much time will it take us) to fix it.\n* Template changes \\- Does the module include templates that change my current design?\n\nWill this module introduce new templates? If yes, will they break my design? How much time will it take to have the design the way we want?\n* Dependencies \\- Does the module depend on any other module?\n\nIf the module depends on others, we need to make sure they are there and installed. Additionally we need to ask ourselves, are we going to want to turn off the module it depends on in the future?\n\n**Advanced:**\n\n* SQL Upgrade scripts \\- Does the module update the DB in some way?\n\nOnce a module updates the database we need to make sure of a few things.\n\nDoes it update a core table? If yes, that's not good, we like our databases clean and ready for upgrade.\n\nDoes it store the information in a sensible way? If we want to get the data raw from the database ourselves, would we be able to make sense of it?\n* Events \\- Does the module observe or dispatch any events?\n\nIf a module dispatches or observes events, we want to know:\n\nWhich events is it observing / dispatching? Will this affect another module working in the system. For example, if one of our modules changes the name of our products on\\-load to uppercase, and this module adds the word 'free' to the name of the product on\\-load, how will it work? Will the word 'free' also come out upper cased?\n* Code Review \\- Does the module use acceptable coding techniques?\n\nThis has more to do with PHP coding techniques than Magento.\n\nDoes the code use Try / Catch blocks?\n\nDoes the code escape user input?\n\nThe specifics of this really depend on our skill level / requirements.\n* Potential issues \\- What potential issues can come up as a result of installing this module?\n\nTry to imagine the top five problems that could come up if we install this module, surprising as it may be, it really gives insight in to the project as a whole.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nAll these things are nice to have in an ideal world, in real world scenarios we need to do this thing called 'compromise' :)\n\nAdditionally, these guidelines are meant to be as a help to us, not to hinder us, as a result if we are only installing one module, let's say a social sharing module, and it's for a client who needs a simple site setup, there is no sense in doing a ton of research.\n\nIn other words: It's all about being efficient with our time, if using this (item in the) guideline helps me save time in the long run use it, if not drop it and save your sanity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is evaluating a third-party Magento extension for potential use in a client's e-commerce store. Which combination of factors would be MOST concerning when assessing the extension's suitability and potential risks?\n\nA) The extension supports the latest Magento version, has positive user reviews, and uses layout updates.\n\nB) The extension overrides core classes, lacks recent support from developers, and modifies core database tables.\n\nC) The extension dispatches custom events, includes new templates, and has a clear refund policy.\n\nD) The extension observes existing events, uses jQuery, and has dependencies on other modules.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B presents the most significant red flags when evaluating a Magento extension:\n\n1. Overriding core classes is generally discouraged as it can lead to conflicts with other modules and make Magento upgrades difficult. Good extensions typically use observers instead.\n\n2. Lack of recent support from developers is a major concern, as it suggests the extension may not be maintained or updated for future Magento versions or security issues.\n\n3. Modifying core database tables is a risky practice that can cause data integrity issues and complicate future Magento upgrades.\n\nIn contrast, the other options contain a mix of neutral or positive factors:\n- Option A includes mostly positive aspects, with layout updates being a normal consideration rather than a red flag.\n- Option C contains elements that require consideration but are not inherently problematic.\n- Option D presents common extension behaviors that need evaluation but are not necessarily negative.\n\nThe combination in option B represents the highest potential for security risks, performance issues, and long-term maintenance problems, making it the most concerning set of factors when evaluating a Magento extension."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/14", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/428691", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/97890/"], "docs_id": 428691, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read many articles about the quantum eraser experiment and I am still trying to figure out why we need it.

This principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously observe both the particle and wave properties of quantum entities.\n\nIn this context:\n- The 'particle' property is represented by 'which-path' information.\n- The 'wave' property is represented by the interference pattern.\n\nBy introducing polarizing elements, researchers can control whether 'which-path' information is available or not. When this information is available, the interference pattern is destroyed, demonstrating that observing the particle nature (path information) prevents the observation of the wave nature (interference).\n\nOption A is incorrect because increasing light intensity is not the main goal of the experiment.\nOption C is wrong because the aim is to manipulate existing interference patterns, not create additional ones.\nOption D is incorrect as beam splitters remain an essential part of the setup.\n\nThe quantum eraser serves as a proof of principle for this fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, showing how our ability to obtain certain types of information about a quantum system affects the behavior we can observe."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/26", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/541744", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/334160/"], "docs_id": 541744, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have Ubuntu 14 as host os.

He has used fraps to record a video of him playing a game. Fraps is a very game\\-specific program used for capturing video of your game while you play. If his question were about how to record in fraps, troubleshooting fraps somehow, or trying to boost his framerate while using fraps, it would be a perfectly legitimate question. But that is not his question. Rather, badp *already* has a recording made with fraps, and from here wants to know what to do with it.\n\nSpecifically, he wants to know how he can make it a reasonable format to upload to the Internet. So this question, simply stated, is: \"I have a video. How do I transcode it?\" This is a good question; it is very specific and an expert on the subject matter can answer it definitively. However, it is not a question relating to gaming. Back to badp's main argument, that he is a gamer who needs help with a gaming tool. This is invalidated. He is finished using his gaming tool, and rather now needs help with a non\\-gaming\\-related tool. In order to understand this, read [this chat log by TomWij](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/87/conversation/tomwijs-explanation-of-transcoding).\n\nThis is analogous to gamers who program games. Game\\-development questions are disallowed here even though many hardcore gamers, especially on this site, know a fair bit about programming. Just because gamers *might* know the answer to your question doesn't make the question any more relevant to *gaming* itself.\n\n[I guess my real problem is that the alternative is asking on \"anything with a question mark in it that happens to be done with a computer and doesn't belong on any other SE site\"](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/132683#132683) \\- badp\n\nI agree that his question deserves an answer. I just believe that Gaming.SE is not the place to get it.

I also do my utmost to delete comments that are no longer needed, so I am not a \"comment whore\" (I think \"whore\" is an expression popular in the US for people who crave attention at all costs. If someone is offended by the term, apologies, a more effective expression does not spring to mind.) Yet, on several occasions on Meta, I find perfectly harmless comments of mine are deleted when I return to visit a page. \n\nA now\\-deleted comment of mine on this [post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/327018/stack-overflow-has-engaged-in-ideological-censorship-and-unwelcoming-behavior) attracted a couple of upvotes, I didn't keep count, yet it was deleted for it being \"chatty\". It was not the only victim of the culling. \n\n**EDIT**  \n\nThe comment which was deleted was, I felt, useful, it was not idle chatter. It was useful to point out that the incriminating post was invisible for users like myself who do not have 10K on Stack Overflow, it was complimenting the OP on the amount of care and attention they spent in composing the question and at the same time reminding users that a post so well thought out and argued takes considerable time. Then there was something else, but I've completely forgotten what it was, too bad, I suppose. If ever there was a more conciliatory comment then that was it.\n\nOn a closely related issue, anything can be interpreted in the wrong light by one or more users, this inevitably leads to prejudicial treatment, and that risk increases when the person commenting is a non\\-native speaker. A number of non\\-native users' posts and comments are weak on nuance, tone and \u2018diplomacy\u2019, and some languages adopt a more direct, perhaps brusque, approach than the pleasantries the English language employs. **This missing tone can make or break a post or a comment.** \n\nHere is one such [question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/327041/4) which I recently edited because the downvotes seemed to be a knee\\-jerk reaction to the OP's original title. After the not insignificant edit, the upvotes started to arrive. \n\nMods and CMs alike should always be fair, even towards users they may personally dislike or find particularly annoying, and recent events have led me to believe that I fit into that category. I have been warned of misusing comments and the veiled threat of suspension has been used as a stick to dissuade me from actively participating. This sounds like sour grapes, doesn't it? It's not. My reaction on finding that a comment (which did not violate CoC and was not off\\-topic) of mine was yet again deleted is of stunned disbelief. \n\nI thought comments on Meta were viewed differently from those on the main site. I found the following [topic](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/270427/when-should-comments-be-flagged-deleted-on-per-site-metas), posted in 2015 by a highly respected mod on a number of SE sites and very recently also appointed as a mod on Meta. \n\n\\[Emphasis in bold mine]\n\n> We all know what comments are for \\-\\- and aren't, but that guidance is, naturally, geared toward main sites, where we want to keep things clean and focused. Meta, on the other hand, is a site's \"second place\", with some different rules and conventions. For example, questions on main sites can be closed as primarily\\-opinion\\-based, **but meta is all about opinions. There's a \"discussion\" tag and such questions collect many opinions. Meta is different.**\n\nThe OP of *Stack Overflow has engaged in ideological censorship and unwelcoming behavior* also expressed perplexity on the deletion of several comments beneath their post. The mod who undertook this action, replied \n \\[Emphasis in bold mine] \n\n> Anything that provided context, potential clarifications/requests that didn't feel like they'd fit into an answer that was on topic but were useful or talked about possible reasons to close (since they are automatic)\\- and a few more that felt like they wouldn't be answers. I *could* have purged them all, and it was tempting, but if you're going to argue out points in comments, that's not what they are there for. **And now, I'll be doing a second round of cleanups**\n\nLater, they added this further explanation\n\n> So, We'll be rather agressively pruning the comments here. Its not social commentary, just housekeeping \\- **but feel free to post any substancial information that's of interest on this topic as a *post***.\n\nI 100% disagree, it is still social commentary. Only the comments agreeing with the deletion of the answer were allowed to stand. How is that not social commentary?\n\nIt's also worth noting that it is impossible to post an answer on a question that has been placed on hold, so that comment was poorly thought out. It happens. \n\nHenceforth\u2013*lovely word*\u2013I shall be taking screenshots of every comment I post on MSE, especially those which express disagreement with a decision undertaken by the team and *do not* violate the CoC. The two can be achieved.\n\nOverall, it seems to me that the arbitrary deletion of comments follows no fixed criteria.\n\nRelated: [I'd like to be able to see \"Unfriendly\" flags lodged against me](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/327110/id-like-to-be-able-to-see-unfriendly-flags-lodged-against-me) \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, there's a *deeply* controversial post, with *lots* of people who need to put in their 2 cents on a comment. And eventually those comments add up.\n\nI could comment on your post, and not actually need to worry about folks downvoting. I'd also lose the ability to have any flavour of nuance. In short, any comment at all could *plausibly* be deleted. SE's toyed with renaming comments clarifications and that's what they are for. Its worth remembering that a post getting over 20 comments is an auto flag, and we often wait, and see before we clear out comments on MSE.\n\nAs for clearing the comments themselves \\- the decision wasn't based on my agreement or disagreement with the comments, but rather how useful they seemed.. I cleared out most of them \\- as is common practice here and elsewhere. Considering the content being about *censorship*, its worth remembering I cleared out comments on *both* sides of the debate that seemed argumentative, keeping a few that felt like they provided useful context.\n\nIf a comment was afoul of the COC, we'd do *much* more than simply clear out the comment\n\n> Mods and CMs alike should always be fair, even towards users they may personally dislike or find particularly annoying, and recent events have led me to believe that I fit into that category.

I'd totally get a second opinion if it was about a *specific* user. *Its not about you* but a *general cleanup of comments*. If you somehow feel its about you, and you've constantly been reminded about the appropriate use of comments, well, maybe you might want to consider why. As a whole *36* comments were deleted, many of them were not yours. Its certainly nothing personal. \n\nSome posts are tricky. The extra clarification was *precisely* because I figured someone would decide to *turn it political* when it wasn't. I also wanted to make it clear that, well *I* made the call, simply cause of the sheer amount of emotion over the issue. \n\nThe closure was a hard call. At the end of the day, this *entirely* seemed like a reaction to a post on MSO, involving issues that have been hashed out in detail on MSO, involving SO community culture.

Reverse DNS entries are managed by the entity controlling the IP address block, which is typically the ISP.

Everywhere I've worked there was a build manager who took care of all of that \\-\\- I'd compile locally with the IDE for development and unit testing, then check in the source code and notify the build manager who did what was necessary to compile everybody's files for the shared environment.\n\nNow that I'm between contracts I've been working on my own self\\-funded project and it's getting to the point where it could be good enough to actually make money. I even have a potential investor lined up and plan to show them a beta version in the next few weeks.\n\nBut all along I just click the build button on the IDE, and it creates the Jar file and it works just fine. Of course, the conventional wisdom suggests that I \"should\" be writing my own Ant/Maven/Gradle scripts and using that instead of the IDE, but what are the concrete advantages of that in my situation (working alone)?\n\nI've done some reading about how to use those build tools, and it just looks like I'd be writing hundreds of lines of XML (or Groovy or whatever) to do to what the IDE does in one click (the IDE\\-generated Ant XML for the project is over 700 lines). It just looks error\\-prone and time\\-consuming and unnecessary for my situation. Not to mention the learning curve, which would take away time from all the other work I'm doing to get the product ready to show people.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd suggest you look into using Maven as opposed to Ant. If your IDE can build your project in one click, then it's likely that Maven can also build your project with virtually no custom configuration.\n\nAnd to answer the question, simplifying the deployment process is one concrete example. If you're building a distributable locally that means that you have to manually deploy that distributable on your production system, and implies that you probably had to do a fair bit of manual configuration on the production system to get it ready for deployment (installing Tomcat, perhaps, or copying over dependencies and resources required by your application). This can be time\\-consuming, and may make deploying updates become a tedious, manual process. It also allows the potential for any minor configuration differences between your production platform and your development environment to cause obscure, difficult to track down errors. \n\nSo anyhow, what I do to get rid of this manual drudgery is that I configure my project to build with Maven, and I configure my `pom.xml` file with all the information required to (in the case of a Java web\\-app) find and download the correct version of Tomcat, install it locally, set up the correct Tomcat configuration files, deploy any project dependencies and the project WAR file itself, and then start Tomcat. I then create a simple shell script (and also a `.bat` version for Windows) that uses Maven to build and start the server:\n\n```\nmvn clean install cargo:start -Dcargo.maven.wait=true\n\n```\n\nSo instead of packaging up a deployable on my dev environment and then manually pushing it up to production, all I have to do is sync from the version\\-control system onto the production server, and then the production system itself builds, installs, and runs the deployable (and does it in a way that is *identical* to how it is done on any development system, minimizing the possibility of platform\\-specific errors or misconfigurations). And whether in the development or production environment, all I do to build and start the server is:\n\n```\n./startServer.sh #or startServer.bat for Windows\n\n```\n\nAnd to deploy an update to the production environment the process is just:\n\n1. Stop the running server instance, if any.\n2. Run `svn update -r<target_release_revision>`.\n3. Run `./startServer.sh`.\n\nIt's simple, easy to remember, and not at all possible to do if I were to rely on using my IDE to build the deployable for me. It also makes reverting to the last\\-known good deployment a snap, should a rollback ever be necessary. \n\nI can't even count the amount of time this approach has saved me over attempting to manually manage the deployment and configuration process.\n\nAnd of course, another answer to your question is automatic dependency management, but I believe that's been covered already by other answers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A solo developer is considering adopting a build tool like Maven for their Java project, which is currently built using only their IDE.

Maybe I am fooled by the context in which this arose, but it seems quite unlikely that \"many\" finite groups are subgroups of $GL\\_2(q)$. Still, I can't seem to exclude a single group, but I am likely being stupid. \n\n**Motivation:** This arose when I tried to do some explicit calculations related to Serre's modularity conjecture. I wanted to get my hands on some concrete Galois representations, and play around with the newforms associated to it. Call it recreational if you like (it certainly is!). In Serre's original paper \\[1], there is a wonderful treatment of some explicit examples. He uses the observation that the Galois group over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ of\n\n$$x^7 \\-7x \\+3$$\n\nis isomorphic to $PSL\\_2(7\\)$. This gives him a surjection $G\\_{\\\\mathbb{Q}} :\\= \\\\mbox{Gal}(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}/\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\rightarrow PSL\\_2(7\\)$, which he combines with the character associated to $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{\\-3})$ to obtain a homomorphism $G\\_{\\\\mathbb{Q}} \\\\rightarrow PSL\\_2(7\\) \\\\times C\\_2$. This homomorphism he can then lift to $GL\\_2(49\\)$ using a very clever calculation in the Brauer group. \n\nThe way I see it (without claiming this is justified) is that it is unclear or even provably impossible to embed $PSL\\_2(7\\)$ directly into some $GL\\_2(q)$, and for that reason we need a nice lifting.\n\nThis raises the natural question of when this little trick with the Brauer group is \"necessary\". What can be said in general about subgroups of $GL\\_2(q)$? Can we exclude any particular finite group or families of finite groups?

Here's a breakdown of its components:\n\n1. `\\fill[blue,opacity=\\X/\\Y]`: This sets the fill color to blue and the opacity to \\X/\\Y. As \\X increases (points get closer to 0) and \\Y remains constant for each frame, the fraction \\X/\\Y increases, making the points more opaque.\n\n2. `(5/\\X,0)`: This determines the position of each point. As \\X increases, 5/\\X decreases, placing points closer to 0 on the number line.\n\n3. `circle[radius=2pt]`: This creates a circular point with a radius of 2pt.\n\nThe combination of increasing opacity and decreasing distance from 0 creates the visual effect of points accumulating near 0, with newer points (closer to 0) appearing more solid.

If so, your hardware isn't causing the problem.\n\n> **Why would I need a \"lock\" on an open directory?**\n\nDPKG/Apt locks `/var/lib/dpkg` to ensure that it can install software in peace, without causing any conflicts to the database of installed packages (present at `/var/lib/dpkg/status`). It's a safety mechanism to keep APT from blowing itself up by accident.\n\n> **How do I find what process is using it?**\n\nYou already have! Look at the output of: `sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock`:\n\n```\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME\naptitude 2166 root    3uW  REG  252,0        0 49021509 /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\n```\n\nThe program `aptitude` (a pretty package manager) is active, and is the current owner of the lock. \n\n> **How do I fix this? Could someone walk me thru the steps?**\n\nThere are a few things you can do. \n\nFirst off, you can just break the lock by running `sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock`. However, it's a good idea not to break this lock to force other `apt` processes to run, as you may be interrupting something important, which may leave your system in an unusable state. Only do this if you're 100% sure that `apt` or `dpkg` isn't running. You can check this by running `ps -aux | grep dpkg` or `ps -aux | grep apt`. If either of these return anything other than a line with `grep` in it, it's unsafe to break the lock.\n\nSecondly, you can go around to all of your terminals to see where `aptitude` is being run, and to check up on it. If you cannot find the terminal that it's on, the `w` command will help you a lot.\n\nThird, you can just kill the process by force, although this may still need you to break the lock. Do this by running `sudo kill <PID>`, where `<PID>` is the number in the `lsof` entry, in your case, `2166`. Do not run `kill -9` for apt, as it will forcefully kill it, while regular `kill` will give apt a chance to clean everything up before it dies. You can also kill the process by rebooting, logging off, or exiting the terminal it's running in.\n\nIf you do forcefully kill `apt` and break the lock, it's a very good idea to run `dpkg --configure -a` to let DPKG fix what was potentially broken."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're troubleshooting an issue where you can't install new software on your Linux system due to a lock on /var/lib/dpkg.

The documentation advises against forcibly breaking the lock (option A) as it may interrupt important processes and leave the system in an unusable state. Using 'kill -9' (option B) is explicitly warned against for apt processes, as it doesn't allow for proper cleanup. Rebooting the system (option D) is a possible solution but is more disruptive and should be considered only if other methods fail.
