This led to a confusing phone conversation with a parent. The lesson learned is that when online interactions are expected to transition to offline communication (like phone calls or in-person meetings), it's crucial to exchange real names to avoid such awkward situations.

How can I restrict a particular application from accessing certain private files, while still allowing the files to be accessed by other applications using AppArmor on openSUSE.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: AppArmor is a [Mandatory Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control \"Wikipedia article on Mandatory Access Control\") (MAC) [Linux Security Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules \"Wikipedia article on Linux Security Modules\") (LSM), used by, amongst other, Ubuntu and SUSE Linux. AppArmor access control rules are defined in AppArmor profiles in `/etc/apparmor.d/`. The profiles are simply text files, which contain information regarding resources the application the profile pertains is allowed to access.\n\nTypically, when [designing profiles](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Profiling_by_hand \"AppArmor Wiki: Profiling by hand\"), one would exercise the application with AppArmor set to `complain` mode, in which access control violations are allowed, but logged. Using the logs, one would iteratively refine the profile. When the profile is done, AppArmor can be switched to `enforce` mode, in which the access control rules defined in the profile are enforced, and any violation attempts logged.\n\nThe outline of an AppArmor profile looks like this:\n\n```\n#include <tunables/global>\n/path/to/application {\n   [...]\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `#include` directives allow statements pertaining to multiple applications to be placed in a common file, then included into the profile of each relevant application.\n\nThe `<tunables/global>` file, corresponding to `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/global` in turn includes definitions that should be available to every profile. One of these additional includes is `/etc/apparmor/tunables/home`, which together with a `@{HOME}/** rw` (or similar directive) grant applications access to user home directories. \n\nIf this is the case, in order to deny access to certain files in the user home directory, one would need to [add a profile rule to explicitly deny access to the files](https://askubuntu.com/questions/177195/apparmor-notify-exclude-application \"apparmor-notify exclude application\"). This can be done using the `deny` directive, such as in the following example:\n\n```\n#include <tunables/global>\n/path/to/application {\n   [...]\n   # Allow directory listings (i.e. 'r' on directories).\n   @{HOME}/ r\n\n   # This is needed for saving files in the home directory.\n   @{HOME}/** rw\n\n   # Revoke access to specific file\n   deny /home/user/file rwa\n}\n\n```\n\nThe would deny read (`r`), write (`w`) and append (`a`) access to `/home/user/file`.\n\nAn alternative is to add the paths you want to protect to `/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/private-files` or `/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/private-files-strict` and make sure the AppArmor profile for each application to be affected includes the `<abstractions/private-files>` or `<abstraction/private-files-strict>`. These files should already contain rules for common files which should be protected for the purpose of privacy or other security considerations. \n\nFor a full list of access mode details and more information on AppArmor security profiles, consult the `apparmor.d` [manual page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/apparmor.d.5.html \"apparmor.d manual page\") and [Novell AppArmor Administration Guide (pdf)](http://www.novell.com/documentation/apparmor/pdfdoc/apparmor2_admin/apparmor2_admin.pdf \"Novell AppArmor Administration Guide\")."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are configuring AppArmor on an openSUSE system to restrict a specific application from accessing certain private files in a user's home directory.

I will be using this network to connect several (4\\-6\\) computers together in a typical (geek) home setting. \n\nI have worked out the topology and most of the components, but there is one I am stuck on: the sockets. The quote I received from the electrician includes Cat 7 cables (probably overkill, but the difference in price to Cat 6 was minimal) and Cat 5 (RJ\\-45\\) sockets. I have a fairly good handle on Cat 5 / 6 / 7 cables, but the sockets have me stumped:\n\n* What does the Category (Cat) of an Ethernet socket signify?\n* If I connect Cat 5 sockets to Cat 7 cables, will I be limited to \"Cat 5\" speeds? Is the difference even likely to be noticeable in a home network?\n* My electrician claims that Cat 6 or Cat 7 sockets are very rare and almost never used. Is this the case? Some Googling has turned up the [GG45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GG45) socket, which seems to be a backwards\\-compatible (with RJ\\-45\\) socket for Cat 7 cables \\- is this what I should be looking for? Or can I replace my Cat 5 sockets with Cat 7 sockets at a later date?\n\nI'm still trying to get my head around this, so I apologise for the somewhat confusing questions, and would be most grateful if anyone can point me onto the correct path! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cat7 connectors are compatible with Cat5, with enhancements and caveats\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCat5, Cat5e, Cat6 and Cat7 are physically and electrically compatible. It's when you try to do 10Gb/s or higher signaling on the cable that the Cat5e standard falls over. Even at that, though, Cat5e will do 10Gbps out to 150 feet.\n\nThe physical connectors for Cat6 and Cat7 cables are still RJ45 plugs, but they're shielded and the standard calls for much less untwisting at the ends of the cable in the connectors than what is permissible for Cat5e. It's \"harder\" to do a proper Cat6 or Cat7 termination.\n\nAside from the wire twist requirements, in order for shielded connectors to work as designed, the grounding conductor in the cable has to be permanently in contact with the metal shield on the plug or jack when it is connected to the cable. You'll also see shielded Cat5e in installations like outdoor radio connections. Properly shielded cables also open up a whole new realm of potential issues like ground loop interference, so all of your equipment needs to be properly grounded, as well.\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nAnyhow... if you connect your Cat7 cable to Cat5e jacks, presuming your Cat5e jacks let you jam the thicker Cat7 wires in (which they *almost* certainly will), you can expect Cat5e performance. Cat5e performance is 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet, or about 125 Megabytes per second). Properly terminated Cat5e will handle 10Gbps out to 150 feet, and Cat6 will handle 10Gbps out to 180 feet. Cat6 is often more than a job calls for, and costs twice as much.\n\nJust for reference, if you have a mechanical hard drive in your computer, it's going to struggle to push more than 120 Megabytes per second. Gigabit Ethernet is every bit as fast as your internal hard drive throughput. If you have an SATA SSD, you may see 500 Megabytes per second, which is \"faster\" than Gigabit Ethernet. With the right switch, you can aggregate ports to create a 2 Gb/s, 3Gb/s, 4Gb/s or faster channel, but any single copy operation will only be able to saturate one of those aggregated links. If you have a PCI express SSD, it may be able to push over a Gigabyte per second, at which point you would need a 10Gbps network to come close to supporting the full throughput of that drive. But in practice, it's rare that you would need that kind of throughput over the network. A RAID built out of PCI express SSD's will support an absurd amount of throughput, at which point you would need to aggregate multiple 10Gbps links to fully support the throughput of the RAID array. But you don't need anything like that unless you're a big datacenter with big SANs and heavy virtualized workloads.\n\nPersonally, just to future\\-proof, I would consider running at least 2 Cat6 or Cat7 cables to every room if I was pulling new cable. But the chances of ever actually needing all that bandwidth are pretty low.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10Gbps Ethernet still costs over $100 per port right now, which is expensive for home use (you could get an 8 port 10Gbps switch for about $850\\).\n\nIt's unlikely that you need bigger bandwidth at your house than what Gigabit Ethernet provides today. On the other hand, I'd check the cost of Cat6 or Cat7 jacks and if you can bear the extra cost, have those installed instead of the Cat5e jacks.\n\nBear in mind that if your installer doesn't terminate those Cat6 or Cat7 jacks correctly (properly bonding the grounding conductor in the cable to the shielding, wire twist rules, etc.), then they aren't really Cat6/7 jacks, anyway. Your installer might know this, and might not want to go to the extra trouble if terminating those cables in full compliance with the standard.\n\nFuture of copper Ethernet\n-------------------------\n\nBy the way, copper network cable has plenty of life ahead of it, out to 50 Gb/s or 100 Gb/s (well over 10 Gigabytes per second), depending on the standard and the cable. Ethernet over optical fiber follows essentially the same roadmap\\-\\-same speeds\\-\\-running out for several years, then jumps to bandwidth like 400Gb/s and higher. Who knows if copper will continue to support those kinds of speeds. But are you really worried about being able to move so much data around your home network that 50Gb/s or 100Gb/s couldn't meet your needs? So you can install fiber if you really want to, but you're going to pay a lot more for every port for a zero or negligible benefit if you go that route.\n\n**Having said all that, I actually do strongly agree with the notion of running conduit so that you can pull new cable later**. Because who knows what's really coming a few years out? One reasonable way to do this is to run the conduits straight up the wall channel from the wall boxes into the attic. You can pull cable straight up into the attic, then run it through the attic suspended from the roof trusses or even strung across the joists.\n\nBut in terms of future\\-proofing, take a look at the [Ethernet Roadmap document from the Ethernet Alliance](http://www.ethernetalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ethernet-Roadmap-2sides-Final-5Mar.pdf)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is installing Ethernet wiring using Cat 7 cables but Cat 5 (RJ-45) sockets.

The performance gain may not justify the cost and difficulty of finding these sockets.\nD is partially correct about future upgrades, but it's not the best answer.

They seem to like going two base first before attacking.\n\nEven if one player is Zerg, they still go with the early two bases and the Zerg doesn't ling rush at all, even if it seems like a logical choice considering the opponent won't have many units; lings can easily destroy the second base.\n\nAre there special rules in GM games (no rush) or do they just like to have a real war game (mass units).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I'm aware, there aren't any official rules about rushing. Early game rushes and all\\-ins don't work nearly as well against the high level players as they do against the weaker or casual players. A player who has very good control over his drones can easily defeat a 6 pool, for example.\n\nAlso, rushing is very hard on the economy, for no guaranteed reward. You say that the lings could easily destroy the second base, but that's not always true. Unless the opponent is doing a high risk early second base, such as Nexus first protoss, then they almost always will have at least some way to try and defend such an attack. If the rusher doesn't do significant damage, then they are stuck with fewer workers, wasted resources on the assault, and only on a single base, which means a significantly harder middle game.\n\nThe size of the map is also a large factor, as well as how early the player scouts and gets scouted. With larger maps, rushes become very risky as it takes longer to reach the opponent's base, giving them time to get units of their own, not to mention the time it takes to scout out said opponent's position.\n\nThere are certainly more factors involved, including the players' predisposition to rushes, but the players that reach that level of play have generally done so by mastering a combination of macro and micro. Rushes get punished much more frequently, and so most players don't believe that the risk is worth the reward at that point."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In high-level StarCraft II gameplay, particularly at the Grandmaster (GM) level, early game rushes are less common than in lower-level play.

At the GM level, early rushes are less effective and riskier for several reasons:\n\n1. High-level players have excellent micro-management skills, allowing them to defend against early attacks more effectively.\n2. Failed rushes significantly hamper the attacker's economy, putting them at a disadvantage in the mid-game.\n3. Larger maps in competitive play make rushes riskier due to increased travel time.\n4.

The problem is that the denominator $\\|f\\_nf\\|$ might be small, which prevents the RHS from being small. Fortunately we can take advantage of the fact $\\\\mu(f\\=0\\)\\=0$ to keep $f$ from getting too small, and since $f\\_n\\\\to f$ in measure, this means that $\\|f\\_nf\\|$ can be kept away from zero \"most of the time\".

However, we're trying to incrementally change the voltage output by the DAC, which goes into a voltage follower controlling a MOSFET that allows current to flow from a high\\-current source into a battery. \n\nHere's a schematic of all that.

Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for initially exploring and understanding the structure of your data?\n\nA) Immediately apply a random forest algorithm to see which features are most important\nB) Use principal component analysis (PCA) to project the data onto lower-dimensional space\nC) Apply k-means clustering to group similar data points\nD) Calculate pairwise correlations between all variables\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most appropriate initial approach for exploring high-dimensional data. The documentation specifically mentions using \"projections to understand correlation between variables and overall distributional structure\" as a key technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. This allows for visualization and identification of important patterns and relationships in the data.\n\nOption A (random forest for feature importance) is a more advanced step that typically comes after initial exploratory analysis. It doesn't help with understanding the overall structure of the data.\n\nOption C (k-means clustering) can be useful for exploring data structure, but it's not as effective as PCA for initial high-dimensional data exploration, especially when trying to understand relationships between variables.\n\nOption D (pairwise correlations) can be informative but becomes unwieldy and difficult to interpret with hundreds of variables. It doesn't provide the same level of insight into overall data structure as projection methods like PCA.\n\nThe question tests the student's understanding of appropriate techniques for exploratory data analysis in high-dimensional spaces, which aligns with the \"get to know your data\" concept mentioned in the original post."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/13", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/87391", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/27312/"], "docs_id": 87391, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the evening, the children told their father what they **had** seen at the zoo.\n\nIn the evening, the children told their father what they **saw** at the zoo. \n\nNow i understand both the sentences are grammatically correct.\nWhat i want to know is, what's the point of using the past perfect tense there?\nI mean, it does make it more clear that the kids went to the zoo first, and told their father what they had seen there second. \nIs there any other reason why we should use the past perfect there?\n\nAnd\n\nWhen Jane had seen the elephants, she wanted to see the giraffes.

By adding a custom property (e.g., 'wasClicked') to each layer object, you can easily track which polygons have been clicked without affecting the layer's standard properties or structure.

This means your model will be really close to your training data. \n\nThe variance is high, because optimizing on only 1\\-nearest point means that the probability that you model the noise in your data is really high. Following your definition above, your model will depend highly on the subset of data points that you choose as training data. If you randomly reshuffle the data points you choose, the model will be dramatically different in each iteration. So \n\n> expected divergence of the estimated prediction function from its average value (i.e. how dependent the classifier is on the random sampling made in the training set)\n\nwill be high, because each time your model will be different.\n\n**Example**\nIn general, a k\\-NN model fits a specific point in the data with the N nearest data points in your training set. For 1\\-NN this point depends only of 1 single other point. E.g. you want to split your samples into two groups (classification) \\- red and blue. If you train your model for a certain point p for which the nearest 4 neighbors would be red, blue, blue, blue (ascending by distance to p). Then a 4\\-NN would classify your point to blue (3 times blue and 1 time red), but your 1\\-NN model classifies it to red, because red is the nearest point. This means, that your model is really close to your training data and therefore the bias is low. If you compute the RSS between your model and your training data it is close to 0\\. In contrast to this the variance in your model is high, because your model is extremely sensitive and wiggly. As pointed out above, a random shuffling of your training set would be likely to change your model dramatically. In contrast, 10\\-NN would be more robust in such cases, but could be to stiff. Which k to choose depends on your data set.

This means the model can capture complex patterns in the data. However, it has high variance because it is extremely sensitive to individual data points. Small changes in the training set can lead to significant changes in the decision boundary. This makes the classifier prone to overfitting, especially in the presence of noise. The high variance is due to the model's dependence on individual data points, which can change dramatically if the training set is reshuffled or slightly modified. This characteristic aligns with the bias-variance trade-off, where a model with low bias often comes at the cost of high variance."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/04", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/867722", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/561022/"], "docs_id": 867722, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My ubuntu VERSION\\=\"14\\.04\\.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr\"\n\nI wanna upgrade svn client to \\>1\\.9 with below two commands\n\n```\nsudo apt-get remove subversion\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\n```\n\nI thought it would automatically give me latest version, however it is 1\\.8\\.8\\.

How do I get the software ready for distribution?\n\nThe school environment has taught me to do a few random tests by hand, make sure nothing is obviously broken, then throw all the source files into a zip and send it off. This is all that's needed to get a good grade is most CS courses. Nobody taught me how to release to real users.\n\nThe only clues I have are a few phrases like \"automated builds\" and \"continuous integration\", but I don't know what these mean. How can I properly distribute my work? How can I make it easy for others? How can I move beyond \"here's the zip\" releases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the real world you really want to come as close to just hitting a button and having everything be automated as you can. If you are installing yourself it's worth the effort because of the time it saves and because you want to make it very hard to make a mistake with live software. If you aren't then it's worth the effort because in almost all cases few people will deal with a difficult installation process.\n\nThis can be quite a lot of work but it's conceptually pretty straight forward. You have to write code that verifies that the transitive closure of all dependencies are satisfied and either fix anything missing or have a good error message. If there are installation options that you can't know in advance you have to support setting those via a UI or script or both. You have to play nicely with whatever standard installation mechanism(s) exist in your environment. \n\nDependencies might not just be files, but might be things like making sure windows registry entries the program relies on are present, configuring a web server for the program, etc.\n\nBasically you have to do programatically everything someone would do by hand, handling all the different possible scenarios.\n\nAutomated build is a pretty self explanatory term. A lot of times the build doesn't get quite all the love it needs, and the build process is written in a document with a lot of steps. It's generally worth the effort to have some form of configuration driving a completely automated script. That's an automated build. Usually part of the build is running automated tests to make sure that not only does the build produce a program, but that at least the tested parts of the program actually work.\n\nContinuous integration isn't feasible without an automated build, which is a big reason an automated build is worth doing. It means that the build gets run automatically using some scheme (like \"whenever new code has been checked in since I finished the last build I was working on\"). Generally a big part of the value of this is that the build runs automated tests, so if code changes break some distant dusty corner of the program you find out automatically and fairly quickly. There may be some value in just knowing it all still compiles though.\n\nDistributing your work and making it easy for others would involve making an installer and following whatever conventions your audience might expect, like putting in an app store, or a source code repository. There are a lot of tools in various environments that, given a name, go find code for you and install it. Your code can participate in that if you follow all the rules needed for those tools to work.\n\nI've been incredibly general because the gory details vary quite a bit in different environments, so a specific answer would depend greatly on exactly what you are doing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer has completed their project and wants to prepare it for distribution beyond just sharing source files.

The real address of a Unix socket is the `device,inode` number tuple, **not the pathname**. If a socket file is *moved*, whichever server was listening on it will be accessible via the new path. If a socket file is *removed*, another server can listen on the same path (that's why the directory permissions of a Unix socket are important, security\\-wise). `lsof` isn't able to cope with that, and may return incomplete / incorrect data.\n2. `ss` is itself buggy, and because the `unix_diag` netlink interface `ss` is using returns the device number in the format internally used by the Linux kernel, but `ss` assumes that it's in the format used by system calls interfaces like `stat(2)`, the `dev:` entry in the `ss -elx` output above will be manged. However, de\\-mangling it may be unwise, because one day they may just decide to fix it. So, the only course of action is to treat `dev:` as pure garbage, and live with the risk of having two socket files with the same inode, but on different filesystems, **which the test above is not able to handle**.\n\n---\n\nIf all of the above doesn't matter for you, you can do the same lousy thing `lsof` does (matching on the path the socket was first bound to), with:\n\n```\nsock=/path/to/socket\nss -elx | grep \" $sock \"\n\n```\n\nwhich should also work on older systems like Centos 7\\.

The documentation states that the real address of a Unix socket is the device,inode number tuple, not the pathname.\n2. It mentions that `ss` has a bug related to the device number format, assuming it's in the format used by system call interfaces when it's actually in the kernel's internal format.\n3. Due to this bug, the documentation suggests treating the `dev:` entry as unreliable and focusing on the inode number for identification.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the pathname is not the most reliable method, as sockets can be moved or removed.\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly mentions a bug in `ss` related to device number formatting.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation suggests that `lsof` may return incomplete or incorrect data, and `ss` is presented as a potentially better alternative despite its limitations."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/07", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/55035972", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/11160030/"], "docs_id": 55035972, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am unable to upload app into play store using ionic v1\\.... error is \"Your uploaded apk or Android app bundle with invalid or missing signing info. you need to create a validly signed apk or Android app bundle.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: the only problem with your code is you are using wrong js context to search for class using js.\n\n> document.getElementByClass('metric')\n\nas classes can be more then 1 so the context to select class is having elements instead of element like below\n**It should be Elements(Plural) not Element(Singular)**\n\n> document.get**Elements**ByClass('metric')\n\nhope this will solve your query.\n\nif need any other help, just comment here I will try to solve"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to select elements by class name in JavaScript, which of the following methods is correct and why?\n\nA) document.getElementByClass('className')\nB) document.getElementsByClass('className')\nC) document.getElementsByClassName('className')\nD) document.getElementByClassName('className')\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct method to select elements by class name in JavaScript is document.getElementsByClassName('className').

Usually, I work with either MDs or social scientists, and odds ratios are the preferred metric. But I am now working with a client in economics/law and she wants the marginal effects and their standard errors, and she wants them at the means of the other variables.\n\nThis isn't easy in SAS, but, with help from tech support, I found that you can do this with PROC NLMIXED, I believe you then need the out \\= der option. Something like this\n\n```\nproc nlmixed data=olivia.small;\n  p=1/(1+exp(-(Intercept+ba*log_fund_age + bb*log_fund_size + bc*yield + bd*loaded + be*log_assets)));\n  model vote_code_num ~ binomial(1,p);\n  parms intercept 36.43 ba -14.55 bb -0.98 bc -0.37 bd 2.2 be -0.07;\n  predict p*(1-p)*ba out=a der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bb out=b der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bc out=c der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*bd out=d der;\n  predict p*(1-p)*be out=e der;\n  where year = 2003;\n  run;\n\n```\n\nbut then the output data sets a, b, c, d and e have the derivatives and their standard deviations for each observation in the data set, not for the mean of the other variables. It's easy to find the mean of all those derivatives, but 1\\) Is that the same as the marginal at the mean of the other variables? and 2\\) How then to get the standard errors?\n\nPeter\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some people would find such 'marginal effects' difficult to interpret and non\\-unique. There are other ways to get 'marginal effects' in binary logistic regression. Because of non\\-collapsibility of the odds ratio, marginal estimates are not well defined in general, and they can represent quantities that are not weighted averages over the factors you are unconditioning on. Mitch Gail has an example where the partial odds ratio for an exposure x2 is 9 for both x1\\=0 and x1\\=1 but is 5\\.44 when not holding x1 constant.\n\n```\n@ARTICLE{gai84bia,\n  author = {Gail, M.H. and Wieand, S. and Piantadosi, S.},\n  year = 1984,\n  title = {Biased estimates of treatment effect in randomized experiments with\n          nonlinear regressions and omitted covariates},\n  journal = Biometrika,\n  volume = 71,\n  pages = {431-444},\n  annote = {covariable adjustment;bias if omitted covariables and model is\n           nonlinear}\n}\n\n```\n\nI wonder also whether you meant 'marginal effect' or 'effect on the original scale'. That would involve two different considerations. Effects on the log odds scale are easier to deal with, and you can relate odds ratios to absolute risk changes (as a function of starting risk) using a simple chart."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In logistic regression, when estimating marginal effects at the means of other variables using SAS PROC NLMIXED, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The mean of derivatives across all observations is exactly equivalent to the marginal effect at the mean of other variables.\n\nB) Marginal effects in binary logistic regression are always well-defined and unique, regardless of the covariates included in the model.\n\nC) The 'out=der' option in PROC NLMIXED automatically provides the standard errors for marginal effects at the means.\n\nD) Marginal effects can be challenging to interpret due to non-collapsibility of odds ratios, and may not represent weighted averages over unconditioning factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the complexities and limitations of marginal effects in logistic regression. As mentioned in the StackExchange discussion, marginal effects can be difficult to interpret due to the non-collapsibility of odds ratios. This means that the effect of a variable can change depending on which other variables are held constant, and marginal effects may not represent simple weighted averages over factors you're not conditioning on.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mean of derivatives across all observations is not necessarily equivalent to the marginal effect at the mean of other variables. \n\nOption B is false because, as the discussion points out, marginal estimates are not well-defined in general for binary logistic regression due to non-collapsibility.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the 'out=der' option provides derivatives for each observation, not the standard errors for marginal effects at the means.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the nuanced nature of interpreting marginal effects in logistic regression and aligns with the cautions raised in the StackExchange discussion about their interpretation and uniqueness."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/05", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7788", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/3350/"], "docs_id": 7788, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **Possible Duplicate:**  \n> \n> [Is there a quick way to lock my Mac?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64/is-there-a-quick-way-to-lock-my-mac)\n\nI want to be able to lock my screen on Mac, much the way Windows\\+l does on windows.

If it is, why is the conditional expectation function a random variable? \n\n$E\\[Y\\\\mid X \\= x]$ would be constant not $E\\[Y\\\\mid X]$, because in the latter we do not consider realisations of $X$ while in the former we do. So what do we mean by that \"conditional on $X$ is treating $X$ as constant?\n\nI paste one paragraph from the econometrics book: \"If the regressors can be treated as nonstochastic, as they would be in an experimental situation in which the analyst chooses the values in X, then the sampling variance of the least squares estimator can be derived by treating X as a matrix of constants. Alternatively, we can allow X to be stochastic, do the analysis conditionally on the observed X, then consider averaging over X as we did in obtaining (4\\-6\\) from (4\\-5\\).\"\n\nI read this as follows. If X is treated as constant, then there is no need to condition on X. If X is treated as random, then do the derivations conditional on X. So conditioning on X does not mean that X is treated as constant. So does E\\[Y\\|X] mean that X is constant? No. X is random, and we just condition on the random X. Conditioning on X does not make X constant. Or am I missing something? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two scenarios exist. From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation):\n\n> Depending on the nature of the conditioning, the conditional expectation can be either a random variable itself or a fixed value.\n\n* If the experimenter cannot control the values of $X$ (the majority of cases in observational studies), the conditional expectation is a random variable because it is a function of a random variable (i.e. $X$).\n* If the experimenter can control the $X$, $\\\\mathbb{E}(Y\\\\mid X)$ is no longer a random variable because $X$ is known.\n\nNotice being known is different from being observed, after all you can observe realisations of a random variable. [This](https://www.reed.edu/economics/parker/s14/312/notes/Notes9.pdf) might help get a better grasp of these two cases."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of linear regression model Y = XB + \u03b5, which statement is most accurate regarding the conditional expectation E[Y|X]?\n\nA) E[Y|X] is always a constant value, regardless of whether X is stochastic or non-stochastic.\n\nB) E[Y|X] is a random variable only when X is treated as a non-stochastic regressor.\n\nC) E[Y|X] is a random variable when X is stochastic, but becomes a fixed value when conditioning on a specific realization X = x.\n\nD) The nature of E[Y|X] as a random variable or fixed value is solely determined by the analyst's choice of treating X as stochastic or non-stochastic in the analysis.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately captures the dual nature of the conditional expectation E[Y|X]. When X is treated as a stochastic (random) variable, E[Y|X] is itself a random variable, as it is a function of the random X. However, when we condition on a specific realization of X (i.e., X = x), the conditional expectation becomes a fixed value.\n\nOption A is incorrect because E[Y|X] is not always constant; it can be a random variable when X is stochastic.\n\nOption B is the opposite of the truth.

For a example, [CD4511BE](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4511b.pdf)? What is the meaning of BE? What are the other suffixes?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every manufacturer has a different set of suffixes they add to their part numbers.\n\nMost often they designate the package (SOIC, QFN, ...). Sometimes there's a code for whether the part is lead\\-free. And sometimes there's a code indicating how quantities of the part are packaged for shipping (usually tape \\& reel, but some parts might be available on different sized reels).\n\nFor analog parts, it's also common to have suffixes (typically 'A', 'B', etc.) designating different precision parts (for example a 1% voltage reference vs a 2% reference), different voltage settings, etc.\n\nYou'll need to check your datasheet to see exactly what suffixes are used for your part and what they mean.

While practices vary between manufacturers, suffixes commonly indicate package type, lead-free status, or shipping methods. The image shows 'BE' specifically means \"16-Lead PDIP\" (package type) and \"RoHS-Compliant Package\" (lead-free status). Option B correctly captures both these aspects. A is incorrect as beta versions aren't typically sold commercially. C is plausible but precision grades usually use single letters like A, B.

However, the level often ends before that, once the enemies in the village have been killed, before the Big Spiders and Cannons are even spawned.\n\nSimilarly, in the first level of Kronor, *Area 5100*, the level is supposed to end after you enter the tunnel and kill all the aliens, then pick up the minigun that materializes.

Eventually, you get to the gates of the palace and enter to end the level. However, the level often ends whether or not you reach the palace. It definitely ends if the combine is destroyed or runs out of fuel, but even if you get in then get out and an unknown amount of time passes.\n\nIn *The Geothermal Tunnels*, you are in the submarine, underwater. Whether or not you take damage, eventually the air/gas runs out so it makes some sense that the level would end at that point even if you have not reached the end, though it could just as easily kill you, thus *require* reaching the end to complete.\n\n---\n\nIf I ignore all the goodies, monsters, secrets, etc. and just go straight towards the end, I can get to it, but trying to get everything in the levels seems to cause this to happen. It seems as though there may be a timer of some sort, but if there is, where/when it is triggered or how long it has is unknown.\n\nAnother thing that they all have in common is that they all include vehicles, but then, there are other levels that include vehicles which do not exhibit this behavior.\n\nDoes anyone know what the trigger or triggers are for the levels or why they may be completing prematurely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think this bug can be fixed by patching the game up to v2\\.070\\.

This approach allows the network adapter to be enabled without conflicting with the virtual guest's IP address. The 169.254.x.x range is used for link-local addressing, which is similar to what happens in Linux/UNIX systems when an interface is brought up without a specific IP configuration. This method enables the host's network adapter to be active (which is necessary for VMware's bridging to work) while still allowing the virtual guest to obtain its own IP address through the bridged connection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because disabling the host's network adapter would prevent the virtual guest from connecting in bridged mode.

Currently we are trying to solve the following problem:\n\nIn various places it is necessary for us to use static helper methods like ImageIO and URLEncoder (both standard Java API) and various other libraries that consist mostly of static methods (like the Apache Commons libraries). But it is extremely difficult to test those methods that use such static helper classes.\n\nI have several ideas for solving this problem:\n\n1. Use a mock framework that can mock static classes (like PowerMock). This may be the simplest solution but somehow feels like giving up.\n2. Create instantiable wrapper classes around all those static utilities so they can be injected into the classes that use them. This sounds like a relatively clean solution but I fear we'll end up creating an awful lot of those wrapper classes.\n3. Extract every call to these static helper classes into a function that can be overridden and test a subclass of the class I actually want to test.\n\nBut I keep thinking that this just has to be a problem that many people have to face when doing TDD \\- so there must already be solutions for this problem.\n\nWhat is the best strategy to keep classes that use these static helpers testable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (No \"official\" sources here, I'm afraid \\- it's not like there's a specification for how to test well. Just my opinions, which will hopefully be useful.)\n\nWhen these static methods represent *genuine* dependencies, create wrappers. So for things like:\n\n* ImageIO\n* HTTP clients (or anything else network\\-related)\n* The file system\n* Getting the current time (my favourite example of where dependency injection helps)\n\n... it makes sense to create an interface.\n\nBut many of the methods in Apache Commons probably *shouldn't* be mocked/faked. For example, take a method to join together a list of strings, adding a comma between them. There's *no point* in mocking these \\- just let the static call do its normal work. You don't want or need to replace the normal behaviour; you're not dealing with an external resource or something that's hard to work with, it's just data. The result is predictable and you'd never want it to be anything *other* than what it'll give you anyway.\n\nI suspect that having removed all the static calls which really are *convenience* methods with predictable, \"pure\" outcomes (like base64 or URL encoding) rather than entry points into a whole big mess of logical dependencies (like HTTP) you'll find it's entirely practical to do the right thing with the genuine dependencies."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and faces challenges with testing classes that use static helper methods from Java API and Apache Commons libraries.

Creating interfaces and wrappers only for genuine external dependencies (like file I/O, network operations, or time-dependent functions) allows for proper mocking and dependency injection where it matters most. This approach recognizes that not all static methods need to be mocked, particularly pure utility functions like string manipulation or encoding, which have predictable outcomes and don't represent external dependencies. This strategy minimizes unnecessary complexity while still enabling effective testing of classes that interact with external systems or resources.\n\nOption A is excessive, as it would create many unnecessary wrapper classes for simple utility functions, adding complexity without significant testing benefits. Option B, using PowerMock for all static calls, is overkill and can make tests more brittle and harder to maintain, especially for simple utility functions. Option D, while potentially workable, introduces unnecessary complexity into the main class and doesn't distinguish between genuine dependencies and simple utility functions."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/02/15", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/86596", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/5782/"], "docs_id": 86596, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to set map scale manualy using ArcGIS Silverlight Api .
