Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Google definition is correct, but poorly written, because it can be parsed with two different meanings, only one of which is correct. I believe you've parsed their definition to have the wrong meaning.\n\nThe Google definition has some implied words that the reader is meant to fill in in their heads. Their definition can be expanded to read:\n\n> last in order of mention or occurrence but not \\[last in order] of importance\n\nThis is the correct meaning of that expression.\n\nIn the Google Dictionary example, it means \"Gary in midfield\" is *not the least important* player.\n\nI think you're parsing the Google definition like this:\n\n> last in order of mention or occurrence but not of \\[any] importance\n\nThis is a valid way to parse the definition. Most people wouldn't parse it this way because being last in order and being unimportant often go together, but parsed that way, it implies they are normally thought of as different.\n\nYour attempt to fix the definition doesn't work because the expression is about the *superlatives* \"last\" and \"least\", but your definition includes the *comparative* \"less\". Less than what?

When we dereference it once (`*baz`), we get `bar`, which is a pointer to a function. Dereferencing it again (`**baz`) gives us the function designator for `foo`.

You should not say \"the two twins\" (since twins implies two) you do not need to say \"new innovations\" (since innovations are always new).\n\nBut pleonastic expressions are not ungrammatical, and some are very common and natural, especially in speech or less formal writing. Sometimes a writer will use a redundant word to emphasise a point.\n\n> There are three types of hunting: Legal trophy hunting, illegal poaching and subsistence hunting for food.\n\nThe author wants to emphasise and contrast trophy hunting, which is legal, with poaching, which is illegal.\n\nAs pointed out in comments, there may be situations in which there is a legal defence to poaching, such as \"necessity\". And there are extended or metaphorical uses of \"poaching\" which do not refer to illegal acts.

Pleonasm involves using more words than necessary to express a meaning. In this case, \"poaching\" already implies illegality in the context of hunting, so \"illegal\" is technically redundant. However, this redundancy can serve a purpose by emphasizing the unlawful nature of the act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while redundant, the phrase is not grammatically incorrect.\nOption C is incorrect because poaching, by definition, is always illegal in the context of hunting wildlife.\nOption D is incorrect because \"poaching\" alone sufficiently conveys the illegal nature of the act in most contexts.\n\nThe correct answer, B, recognizes that while redundant, the phrase can be used deliberately for emphasis, especially in contexts where the illegality of poaching is being contrasted with legal forms of hunting."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/25", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52147", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/23265/"], "docs_id": 52147, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have OS X 10\\.6\\.8 and I run MS Word:Mac 2011\\.

That software looks at IP addresses in an attempt to deny spammers who continually create new accounts from being able to post spam.\n\nCookies however are things that are stored on your computer, not on Stack Exchange servers.

I'm not very handy, and I've never done anything like this before, so I'd love some advice/guidance!\n\nThe end goal is for the shelf to hold a 3 gallon aquarium (18 x 5\\.5 x 7\"). The total weight of water is around 25 lbs, but I want the shelf to hold at the very least 50 lbs to be safe and to include the tank and rocks/material itself. \n\nI've been looking at these wall brackets from Home Depot (or other similar ones), which say they can hold 200 lbs per pair:\n[http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt\\-10\\-in\\-x\\-12\\-in\\-White\\-Shelf\\-Bracket\\-15254/202034279](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-10-in-x-12-in-White-Shelf-Bracket-15254/202034279)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4u1fm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4u1fm.png)\n\nPlanning for the shelf itself to be 10 inches deep.\n\nI've also marked out the approximate location of studs on the wall here:\n\n[![Wall with irregularly spaced studs marked](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZT02.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZT02.jpg)\n\nThere are a total of four, though the fourth stud (one closest to the door) seems to be narrower than the rest.

Using the option `matrix of nodes` then also each cell has a name in the form `<matrix name>-<row>-<column>`.\n\nSince we have a name we can access anchors as `<matrix name>.<anchor>`. But we have to know where these anchors are located. For debugging purposes we can add this code right after the previous `\\matrix` definition:\n\n```\n% debugging purposes\n\\draw[red](m.south west)rectangle(m.north east);\n\n\\foreach \\anchor/\\placement in\n    {north/above,  south/below, east/right, west/left,\n     north west/above, north east/above,\n     south west/below, south east/below}\n     \\draw[shift=(m.\\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)} node[\\placement=0.15cm]{\\scriptsize\\texttt{(m.\\anchor)}};\n\n```\n\nNow the table looks like:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmbqZ.png)\n\nIn the picture there are two notes: they are added with \n\n```\n% Where to put the notes according to what we learnt about matrices\n\\node[below=0.5cm] at (m.south west) {Note};\n\\node[below=0.5cm, align=center,text width=5cm] at (m.south) {Another Note which is supposed to be longer};\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX and TikZ information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about creating a Prisoner's Dilemma-style table using TikZ in LaTeX is correct?\n\nA) The `\\matrix` command in TikZ can only create rectangular grids and cannot accommodate additional cells outside the main grid.\n\nB) To add labels above and to the left of the matrix, you must use separate `\\draw` commands instead of `\\node` commands.\n\nC) The syntax `m-2-3` in TikZ refers to the cell in the second row and third column of a matrix named 'm'.\n\nD) When using TikZ to create a matrix, it's impossible to adjust the size of individual cells without affecting the entire grid.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct. In TikZ, when you create a matrix and give it a name (e.g., `\\matrix (m)`), each cell can be referenced using the syntax `<matrix name>-<row>-<column>`. So `m-2-3` indeed refers to the cell in the second row and third column of a matrix named 'm'.\n\nOption A is incorrect because TikZ matrices can accommodate additional cells or elements outside the main grid, as demonstrated by the extra cell for \"Name 3\" in the example.\n\nOption B is false because the example clearly shows that `\\node` commands are used to add labels above and to the left of the matrix.\n\nOption D is incorrect because TikZ allows for individual cell size adjustments using styles like `minimum width` and `minimum height`, as shown in the `element/.style` definition in the example."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/09", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/41527", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3959/"], "docs_id": 41527, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some basic knowledge of English grammar (this is what I think!!!).

It is not a replacement for a database, but it makes a good addition to add functionality, specifically advanced text searching, along side your existing database.\n\nI see where you can get them confused. They can actually fit the same need, but not always. ElasticSearch does exactly what it sounds like, *searches*. A graph database doesn't specify relations or indexes, where as ElasticSearch does. So fundamentally they work quite differently. ElasticSearch *analyzes* documents with, for example, English analyzer. What this does it will take words and analyze different variations of that word or even synonyms. For example, `dig`, would be anaylzed as `dig,digs,dug,digging,digger ...`. When you run a query on elasticsearch your queries can also be analyzed, then those words are queried for and can be *scored* by relevance.\n\nElasticSearch is a great tool, because it's really flexible. You can find a wide range of relative content, or you can find a needle in the hay stack, and its relatively easy.\n\nGraph Databases have their advantage too. Finding relevance/relations between things like hash tags for example, or things with many mutable relations. They're great and interesting pieces of technology, however I'd have to say that its not as powerful as ElasticSearch. Mostly because ElasticSearch is geared towards this sort of thing, and it handles analysis for you so you can do full\\-text search. However if you're looking to use a system more so like twitter's search that's based on predefined tagging/keywords, then you'd be better off using the Graph Database your already using.\n\nThe question is how robust do you want your searching to be? If you have a need to do really fine grain(full text) searches I'd use elasticsearch. Otherwise you can always implement a search relatively easily on a graph database. Once you have search implemented its not impossible to migrate to elasticsearch if you find yourself later needing a more robust search engine, just implement your search with that in mind."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A social networking application currently uses Neo4j as its primary database.

In this case, the detective's original theory connecting the two crimes is proven false, effectively debunking his initial assumption.\n\nA) Corroborate is incorrect because it means to confirm or give support to a theory, which is the opposite of what's happening in this scenario.\n\nC) Substantiate is incorrect as it means to provide evidence to support or prove the truth of something, which doesn't apply to disproving a theory.\n\nD) Validate is incorrect because it means to check or prove the validity or accuracy of something, which is not the case here where a theory is being disproven.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of vocabulary related to critical thinking and the process of proving or disproving theories in investigative contexts."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/02", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4559", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1857/"], "docs_id": 4559, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to know if there is a standard way of making licenses on Mac OS 10\\.6\\. For exemple, if I am creating an application and I want to create a licensing system, do I leave a file somewhere in the system that my application can read/write?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mac OS X Applications, tend to be limited due to the UNIX \u201copen\u201d nature of the operating system. Contrary to Windows for example, where one could bury an entry into the Registry under any name, provided you\u2019re given Admin privileges (which is very *natural* in Windows). \n\nUnder OS X, applications are *forced* to use dedicated locations for storing settings and preferences. \\~/Library and /Library. \n\nWith that being said, this doesn\u2019t stop some applications to use other mechanisms in conjunction with that. \n\nI cannot name them all primary because I don\u2019t know all of the existing ways, but I can tell you some common forms:\n\n**Serial Number / License Key**: These are the typical. The program stores an \u201cencrypted\u201d copy of these values in its preferences (sometimes even unencrypted), usually located in:\n\n* \\~/Library/Preferences or /Library\n* The Application Bundle itself\n* Some value in the user\u2019s Home folder (possibly hidden by a .)\n\nThe problem with these are obvious, the serials get published/shared/copied and you have no way to stop it. Some applications have a \u201cblacklist\u201d of serials that although perfectly formatted, are internally hardcoded to be bad. \n\n**Online Activation**: Less common (and usually more annoying), these require the app to connect to an online host to \u201cactivate\u201d or \u201cvalidate\u201d the license. This prevents a lot of fraud and usually ends with the application cracked by some genius, where the code that does the validation is simply modified to always return \u201cok\u201d making the application believe that the internet stuff went ok. Read: Adobe Products.\n\nIn any case, the program has to store the value somewhere, and the usual locations apply. \n\n**Tied with Hardware ID** This is common too, they extract your drive\u2019s serial number and some other parameters (Network card MAC Address for example) and they create a serial number that checks for those. So even if you \u201ccopy\u201d the license, the new machine won\u2019t have the same values and it will fail. This is annoying because if your hard drive crashes and you boot from a backup, you\u2019ll have to re\\-register. \n\n**RESOURCES**\n\nI assume you want to continue reading about this, so instead of believing me, follow these links: \n\n* [How should my Cocoa application store the user\u2019s license key?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960660/how-should-my-cocoa-application-store-the-users-license-key)\n* [What is the best way to protect a Cocoa shareware application from software piracy?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/889861/registration-for-cocoa-shareware)\n* [MAKeyedArchived](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MAKeyedArchiver)\n* [Using OpenSSL for keys](http://sigpipe.macromates.com/2004/09/05/using-openssl-for-license-keys/) (good read!)\n* [AquaticPrime](http://www.aquaticmac.com/): the famous secure registration framework (free, accepts donations)\n* [Golden % Braeburn](http://www.golden-braeburn.com/): The not free method used by the famous Delicious Library (among others)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following licensing mechanisms for Mac OS X applications is LEAST likely to be compromised by simply sharing or copying license information between users?\n\nA) Storing an encrypted serial number in ~/Library/Preferences\nB) Saving a license key within the Application Bundle itself\nC) Using online activation that requires connecting to a server\nD) Keeping an unencrypted license value in a hidden file in the user's Home folder\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Online activation that requires connecting to a server is the least likely to be compromised by simple sharing or copying of license information. This method validates the license with an external server, making it more difficult to bypass compared to locally stored license keys or serial numbers.\n\nOption A (storing encrypted data in preferences) and B (saving in the Application Bundle) can potentially be copied between machines.

However, it also mentions that there are no immediate plans to sell ads on sites other than the original trilogy (StackOverflow, ServerFault, and Superuser). The company's priority is not currently focused on advertising for SE 2.0 sites, especially since sites with lower traffic don't generate significant ad revenue.

The solution shows a graph similar to the cosine graph which makes me absolutely confused. How can the value of magnetic flux be negative (when the graph is under the x\\-axis)? According to the definition, magnetic flux is the total number of magnetic field lines that pass through a chosen surface area, so how can that number be negative since after the flux is 0 (when the coil is parallel to the magnetic field lines), at that position the coil can still capture some magnetic field lines? Please give me a simple and elaborate explanation as I am relatively new to the topic. Thank you so much for helping.\n\n[![this is the question](https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6zr4.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6zr4.png)\n\n[![this is the solution](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnZXj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnZXj.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The magnetic flux is the amount of field lines (the magnetic flux density) going through a given area. The equation for magnetic flux is $$ \\\\Phi \\= \\\\vec B \\\\cdot d\\\\vec A \\= BAcos\\\\theta$$, where both the magnetic flux density and the area are vectors. It is clear mathematically from the dot product that $\\\\Phi$ can be positive (when area and flux are in same relative direction) or negative( when they are in opposite directions). \n\nYour confusion comes from not taking into account that the area we choose must be directed in some way. You might think this is an unnecessary distinction. However, in order for our mathematical formulation of magnetism to be consistent it is important. \n\nTake Faradays law for example. It says that the loop in your diagram will induce an electric current in the direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux. If you claim the flux increases (positively) after the point where it is zero, then what you are saying is that the change in magnetic flux is zero at that point and hence the induced current is zero. Yet, from experiment we know this is not true. There is current and thus we must still be having a change in flux in the negative direction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A circular coil is rotating in a uniform magnetic field as shown in the diagram. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the magnetic flux through the coil?\n\nA) The magnetic flux is always positive and reaches its maximum when the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines.\n\nB) The magnetic flux oscillates between positive and negative values, following a cosine function, with the flux being zero when the coil is parallel to the magnetic field lines.\n\nC) The magnetic flux is always positive and reaches its minimum (zero) when the coil is parallel to the magnetic field lines.\n\nD) The magnetic flux is constant throughout the rotation of the coil, regardless of its orientation relative to the magnetic field lines.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The magnetic flux through the coil follows a cosine function as it rotates in the magnetic field. It oscillates between positive and negative values because the flux is a vector quantity, defined as \u03a6 = B\u22c5dA = BAcos\u03b8. The flux is maximum (positive) when the coil is perpendicular to the field lines with its normal vector aligned with the field, zero when parallel to the field lines, and minimum (negative) when perpendicular but with its normal vector opposing the field. This oscillation is crucial for understanding phenomena like electromagnetic induction and ensures consistency with Faraday's law of induction."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/27",

One of reason because of Page Cache, Static resource or Indexer not updated. So try remove /var/ and /pub/static/ (do not remove .htaccess) Run following command.\n\nphp bin/magento cache:flush\n\nphp bin/magento setup:upgrade\n\nphp bin/magento setup:static\\-content:deploy \\-f\n\nphp bin/magento indexer:reindex\n\nphp bin/magento setup:di:compile (optional)\n2. Problem with layered navigation, when we try to change or select sub category when base/parent category is set as anchor. Probably solution we can set value of \u201cNo\u201d of base/parent category and once again change it to \u201cNo\u201d.

This approach clears cached data, updates the database schema, deploys static content, and reindexes all indexers. It covers issues related to outdated caches, static resources, and indexes, which are common causes of this error. \n\nOption A is insufficient as it only clears the cache without addressing potential issues with static content or indexers. \n\nOption B might work in some cases where the issue is specifically related to layered navigation and anchor categories, but it doesn't address other potential causes and is less comprehensive. \n\nOption D is too limited, focusing only on one specific indexer when the issue could be related to multiple indexes or other factors."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/29", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/337089", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/255168/"], "docs_id": 337089, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to write a library for Mechanical State Estimation of a vehicle. This is, estimate variables as position, velocity an so on, using the information provided by different sensor measurements (GPS, IMU, ... ).\n\nThese are things to keep in mind:\n\n* I am not a very skilled programmer.\n* The estimation algorithm will be the Kalman filter.\n* The library is intended to be used in real\\-time systems.\n* I want to write the library in both, C\\+\\+ and Java.\n* I think that an object\\-oriented design could help, but what I really want is the code to be efficient (fast updates, given that we could want it to run in microcontrollers, such as the ones in Arduino, or Raspberry Pi. There are IMUs able to supply data at 1000Hz, but the fastest update rate I have reached with Arduino is about 50Hz).\n\nI have some considerations that the implementation should fulfill:\n\n* The estimated state must be predicted using our knowledge about the process.\n* The estimated state must be updated fusing the information of a sensor set.\n* We could be interested in different state estimations, each constructed from different information (from different sensor sets, from measurements taken at different frequency, ... ).\n* Each sensor gives measurements that are differently related with the state of the system, so each sensor should have a different ''update()'' method.\n* Each sensor has different position, orientation, calibrations, and characteristics.\n* I would like to be able to expand the library adding sensor types, or variables to the state in an easy way.\n\nI've outlined a preliminary design for the library:\n\n[![preliminary library design](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LVRr.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LVRr.png)\n\nFinally, the questions are:\n\n* Knowing that I want as fast access as posible, \u00bfhow can I have direct access to variables of **State** from ''update()'' methods of **InformationSources**?\nI have read that for Java I could define the 2 classes in the same package, and define the variables as protected.\nI also know about the ''friend'' keyword in C\\+\\+.\nBut I do not know if these are good practices.\n* I would appreciate any other possible ideas, so, \u00bfdo you devise some other design?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> \\[H]ow can I have direct access to variables of State from ''update()''\n>  methods of InformationSources?\n\nThis is almost certainly a case of **premature optimization**. \n\nIt's not clear what your actual performance requirements are (you should think about defining these), but it's highly unlikely that the overhead of some method calls is going to make any difference to whether you meet those requirements.\n\nYou should implement this as normal, with methods to get the information you need.\n\nIn the unlikely event that this does become a performance issue, you can rewrite it to work another way (a performance requirement would be a reasonable justification for breaking the normal \"good practice\" rule of not accessing class variables directly. So I would suggest your proposed methods are fine, should you need a solution)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In developing a real-time Mechanical State Estimation library for vehicles using Kalman filters, which approach is most recommended for accessing State variables from InformationSources' update() methods, considering both performance and good programming practices?\n\nA) Use the 'friend' keyword in C++ and define variables as protected in the same package for Java to allow direct access to State variables.\n\nB) Implement normal getter methods in the State class and use these methods to access the variables, prioritizing good design practices over premature optimization.\n\nC) Always use direct variable access, bypassing any getter methods, to ensure the fastest possible performance for real-time systems.\n\nD) Create a shared memory space between State and InformationSources classes to allow instant access to variables without method calls.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to implement normal getter methods in the State class and use these methods to access the variables. This aligns with good object-oriented design practices and avoids premature optimization. The documentation emphasizes that direct access to variables should only be considered if there's a proven performance issue, which is unlikely in most cases. Starting with a clean, well-designed approach allows for easier maintenance and expansion of the library. If performance becomes a bottleneck later, optimizations can be made with justification.

The product owner does not discuss the details of how it will be done and stops the discussion if team tries so. This applies to all work items (new UI, new API or changes to existing UI/API). Product Owner's reasoning is that getting into the details (both technical \\& functional) of how it will be done is something that needs to happen during sprint and discussing it during grooming is not correct. The effort estimation also happens based upon this discussion.\n\nBut during sprint planning, approved items are taken for the sprint and expectation is that if work item is approved, team should know all the details of the solution and should be able to complete the item in sprint. What happens is team spends first 2\\-3 days in doing the research and getting the PO's approval for the solution (UI design, key business logic clarification). Unless the analysis results in great difference in effort estimate, team is asked to complete the feature. This happens in each sprint.\n\nI dont have a problem with putting extra effort in completing the work item. My question is regarding the process.\n\n1. Should the team say no in approving the item unless team understands how the solution will look like?\n2. Should the work item be splitted into research/analysis in which solution prototype will be proposed to the PO? Once the PO will approve the prototype, the main work item will be marked approved.\n3. Any other suggestion as to how it can be handled in better way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The level of detail at the planning meeting depends a lot on the personality and expertise of the PO.\n\nTake user interface as an example: Some product owners have strong UX skills or use UX experts outside the team. These PO's better come with a rough UX spec to the planning meeting. In other cases this skill is more present inside the team. Those teams handle the UX design as part of the implementation. The problem arises if the PO has strong opinions about the UI, but fails to communicate in advance what he wants. That is unfair towards the team. \n\nIn short, if it affects the acceptance of a work item, then the PO should not avoid the question at planning meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, you can't expect him to have all the answers prepared, the team must also think actively and give him some options to choose from. \n\nOne good way to approach this at the planning meeting, is to formulate questions to the PO as \"would you accept the story if ...\". \n\nBack to your questions:\n\n> Should the team say no in approving the item unless team understands how the solution will look like?\n\nYes, if the PO is unable to give clarity on what he will accept and what not. \n\n> Should the work item be splitted into research/analysis in which solution prototype will be proposed to the PO? Once the PO will approve the prototype, the main work item will be marked approved.\n\nIf for a certain work item, you all feel an iterative approach would be best (\"let's see how this works, and then decide if it needs a change\"). Then it is better to split it into two items. But don't think of step 1 as a prototype, make it \"potentially shippable\" based on current understanding of the team and PO. The PO can always define work items to improve it later. \n\n> Any other suggestion as to how it can be handled in better way?\n\nSome teams or PO's will prepare rough UX specs (wireframe) before the planning meeting: Aim for early failure. Just enough to agree on.

The Product Owner (PO) avoids discussing implementation details during grooming, which leads to the team spending the first few days of each sprint doing research and getting PO approval for solutions. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in addressing this issue while maintaining Agile principles?\n\nA) The team should refuse to approve any work items until they fully understand all implementation details, regardless of the PO's preference.\n\nB) Split all work items into two parts: a research/analysis phase to propose a solution prototype, followed by the main implementation phase after PO approval.\n\nC) The team should commit to completing all approved items within the sprint, even if they don't have full clarity on the implementation details.\n\nD) The PO should provide enough clarity on acceptance criteria during planning, while the team actively proposes options, using questions like \"would you accept the story if...?\" to reach a mutual understanding.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most effective approach as it balances the responsibilities of both the Product Owner and the development team while adhering to Agile principles. This approach encourages collaboration and communication between the PO and the team, ensuring that there's enough clarity on acceptance criteria without over-specifying implementation details. It allows for flexibility in how solutions are developed while still providing a clear understanding of what constitutes an acceptable outcome.\n\nOption A is too rigid and could lead to unnecessary delays in the planning process. Option B, while potentially helpful in some cases, may introduce unnecessary overhead if applied to all work items and doesn't address the core communication issue.

When `bash` is run in login mode, it doesn't read/execute `~/.bashrc`. Instead, it reads and executes `~/.profile`. If you want to put things in your `~/.bashrc` and have them read and executed in every new Terminal window, you need to create a shell script file called `~/.profile`, and have that file contain a command that looks for your `~/.bashrc` and reads and executes it.\n\nIn case the verb \"source\" threw you off: \"sourcing\" a shell script file is when a shell (such as `bash`) reads shell commands from a file and runs those commands *in the current shell process, so they affect the environment of the current shell process*. Usually other shell script files you write are not *sourced*; instead, they are executed in a sub\\-shell (a separate instance or copy of `bash`), and they can't change anything in the environment of their parent shell (the main instance of `bash` that was started when you opened the new Terminal window).\n\nTo get a shell to source a script, you use the `source` command, which is built into the shell. A shortcut for the `source` command is `.` (yep, just a dot/period/full\\-stop character). In a previous version of this Answer, I used the `.` operator instead of the `source` command."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: On macOS, you've added an alias to your ~/.bashrc file, but it's not working when you open a new Terminal window.

Since you need help even finding the right terms and formulating your question, I can speak briefly in generalities.* \n\nThe term you are looking for is [data cleaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing). This is the process of taking raw, poorly formatted (dirty) data and getting it into shape for analyses. Changing and regularizing formats (\"two\" $\\\\rightarrow 2$) and reorganizing rows and columns are typical data cleaning tasks. \n\nIn some sense, data cleaning can be done in any software and can be done with Excel or with R. There will be pros and cons to both choices: \n\n* **Excel:** Excel is almost certainly the most common choice for data cleaning (see R fortunes \\#59 [pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/vignettes/fortunes.pdf)). It is also considered a poor choice by statisticians. The primary reason is that it is hard to ensure that you have caught everything, or that you have treated everything identically, and there is no record of the changes that you have made, so you can't revisit those changes later. The upside of using Excel is that it will be easier to see what you are doing, and you don't have to know much to make changes. (Statisticians will consider the latter an additional *con*.)\n* **R:** R will require a steep learning curve. If you aren't very familiar with R or programming, things that can be done quite quickly and easily in Excel will be frustrating to attempt in R. On the other hand, if you ever have to do this again, that learning will have been time well spent. In addition, the ability to write and save your code for cleaning the data in R will alleviate the cons listed above. The following are some links that will help you get started with these tasks in R: \n\nYou can get a lot of good information on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): \n\n\t+ [How does one reorder colums in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/5620885/1217536)\n\t+ [R: How can I reorder the rows of a matrix, data.frame or vector acording to another one?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2785998/1217536) \n\n[Quick\\-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) is also a valuable resource: \n\n\t+ [sorting](http://www.statmethods.net/management/sorting.html) \n\nGetting numbers into numerical mode: \n\n\t+ [Convert written number to number in R](https://stackoverflow.com/q/18332463/1217536)\n\t+ [?strtoi](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strtoi.html) is a specialized function for converting from hexidicimal, etc., if necessary \n\nAnother invaluable source for learning about R is [UCLA's stats help website](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/): \n\n\t+ [working with factor variables](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/modules/factor_variables.htm) (for your \"mostly agree\", etc.) \n\nLastly, you can always find a lot of information with good old Google: \n\n\t+ This search: [data cleaning in r](https://www.google.com/search?q=data%20cleaning%20in%20r&oq=data%20c%20in%20r&gs_l=serp.3.0.0i7i30l9j0i8i7i30.26069.28149.0.31628.6.6.0.0.0.0.409.895.2-2j0j1.3.0.ehm_pq_qw,hmrde=0,hmffs=10,hmffl=3,hmffmp=0-7...0...1.1.47.serp..3.3.892.pSZOyTJGnyo), brings up a number of tutorials (none of which I've worked through, FTR).\n\n---\n\n*Update:* This is a common issue regarding the structure of your dataset when you have multiple measurements per 'study unit' (in your case, a person). If you have one row for every person, your data are said to be in 'wide' form, but then you will necessarily have multiple columns for your response variable, for example. On the other hand, you can have just one column for your response variable (but have multiple rows per person, as a result), in which case your data are said to be in 'long' form. Moving between these two formats is often called 'reshaping' your data, especially in the R world. \n\n* The standard R function for this is [?reshape](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/reshape.html). There is a [guide](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/reshape.htm) to using `reshape()` on UCLA's stats help website.\n* Many people think `reshape` is hard to work with. [Hadley Wickham](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/46/hadley) has contributed a package called [reshape2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which is intended to simplify the process. Hadley's personal website for reshape2 is [here](http://had.co.nz/reshape/), the Quick\\-R overview is [here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html), and there is a nice\\-looking tutorial [here](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html).\n* There are very many questions on SO about how to reshape data. Most of them are about going from wide to long, because that is typically what data analysts are faced with. Your question is about going from long to wide, which is much less common, but there are still many threads about that, you can look through them with [this search](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5Br%5D%20reshape%20is%3Aquestion%20%22long%20to%20wide%22).\n* If your heart is set on trying to do this with Excel, there is a thread about writing a VBA macro for Excel to replicate the reshape functionality here: [melt / rehshape in Excel using VBA?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10921791/1217536)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A research assistant is faced with restructuring a large dataset containing over 10,000 entries.

Reproducibility: Using R and saving the code allows for easy replication of the data cleaning process in the future.\n\n2. Documentation: The R script serves as a clear record of all transformations applied to the data.\n\n3. Efficiency: The reshape2 package, developed by Hadley Wickham, is designed to simplify the reshaping process compared to base R's reshape() function.\n\n4.

Error reduction: Programmatic approaches reduce the risk of manual errors compared to Excel-based methods.\n\n6.

Option B improves on A but still relies on Excel, which is not ideal for statistical work. Option C is a good approach but the base reshape() function can be more complex to use than reshape2.

Sadly, that is not likely to happen without a completely new unit system, and because you can treat a relative\\-absence like a charge, it's very, very common for books to simply say \"the (positive) charge flows like...\" rather than \"the electrons carry their negative charge in a flow like the opposite of...\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When a neutrally charged object comes into contact with a positively charged object, which of the following best describes the charge transfer process?\n\nA) Protons from the positively charged object move to the neutral object\nB) Positive \"holes\" flow from the positively charged object to the neutral object\nC) Electrons from the neutral object move to the positively charged object\nD) Positive ions are exchanged between the two objects\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. Protons are immobile in solid conductors as they are contained within the nucleus.\nB) Incorrect. While the concept of \"holes\" is used in semiconductor physics, it's a conceptual model rather than an actual transfer of positive particles.\nC) Correct. Electrons, being the mobile charge carriers, move from the neutral object to the positively charged object to neutralize the charge imbalance. This flow of electrons is equivalent to what is often described as \"positive charge\" spreading, even though it's actually the movement of negative charge.\nD) Incorrect.

We were all compotent programmers, so if the code worked, we were happy.\n\nNow, there were a handful of times where something came up months or years down the line that might have been caught in a review, but they were so few and far between that I'm not sure it'd be useful.\n\nI guess my question is:\n\n1. Do you consider reviews to be useful?\n2. How often do you do them?\n3. How much of your time is spent reviewing code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Absolutely. There are lots of bugs you can catch early via code review. And there are certain types of bugs you can hardly catch any way else than code review (e.g. some concurrency bugs). But what is even more important: (group) code reviews are a great way to spread and share a coherent, consistent view of design, architecture, coding idioms and best practices throughout the development team. The only better way I can imagine is pair programming \\- which in fact is an extreme form of code review.  \n\nThe prime goal of (classic, formal) code reviews is in fact not catching bugs already present in the code, but preventing (future) bugs from getting into the code, via the above mentioned continuous communication / mentoring / discussion between team members, generated during review meetings.  \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why code reviews are still rare. They show their real benefit only in the long term, so it takes perseverance to get there, and most managers (and developers alike) have never experienced it.\n2. In our current project, we have been doing it only occasionally up to now, but it is bound to change. The new aim is to get every code change reviewed by someone else before it gets into production. In an earlier project, we did that and it was useful. In an even earlier project, we did formal group code reviews, and it was still useful, but fairly slow and time consuming. We couldn't have reviewed every code change in that manner without slowing down our pace of development enormously. But for some types of projects, even that pays off. If human lives are at stake, your prime motivation isn't saving dimes.\n3. Up to now it was no more than an hour per week on average. According to our new process, this is surely going to increase. In the earlier projects mentioned, IIRC it was 2\\-4 hours per week on average."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is described as the prime goal of classic, formal code reviews?\n\nA) Catching bugs already present in the code\nB) Preventing future bugs from getting into the code\nC) Speeding up the development process\nD) Reducing the workload of testers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer states that \"The prime goal of (classic, formal) code reviews is in fact not catching bugs already present in the code, but preventing (future) bugs from getting into the code.\" This is achieved through continuous communication, mentoring, and discussion between team members during review meetings.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the time derivative of the moment of inertia tensor (dJ/dt) for this system?\n\nA) dJ/dt represents the rate of change of the body's rotational kinetic energy.\n\nB) dJ/dt is always zero for a rigid body, regardless of its motion.\n\nC) dJ/dt contributes to the total torque acting on the body in the equation of motion.\n\nD) dJ/dt is irrelevant in the analysis of the body's rotational dynamics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The time derivative of the moment of inertia tensor (dJ/dt) plays a crucial role in the rotational dynamics of a rigid body when its orientation is changing and/or its center of mass is moving relative to the fixed point of rotation.\n\nIn the equation of motion for angular momentum:\n\ndL/dt = J * (d\u03c9/dt) + (dJ/dt) * \u03c9 = \u03c4\n\nThe term (dJ/dt) * \u03c9 contributes to the total torque \u03c4 acting on the body. This term accounts for the changing geometry of the body relative to the fixed point of rotation, which affects the distribution of mass and thus the moment of inertia.\n\nOption A is incorrect because dJ/dt itself doesn't directly represent the rate of change of rotational kinetic energy. The rotational kinetic energy depends on both J and \u03c9.\n\nOption B is false because dJ/dt is not always zero for a rigid body. It can be non-zero when the body's orientation changes or when its center of mass moves relative to the fixed point of rotation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because dJ/dt is indeed relevant in analyzing the body's rotational dynamics, as it appears in the equation of motion for angular momentum."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/15", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/132547", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/56752/"], "docs_id": 132547, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am writing a sentence.\n\n> All trust evaluation models need to specify their targets, which can be individual agents or agent groups.\n\nIs it necessary to add \"either\"?\n\n> All trust evaluation models need to specify their targets, which can be either individual agents or agent groups.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both the sentences are correct, with the same meaning.
