As a consequence, the results are dependent on the initial conditions (e.g., if randomly choosing the initial cluster centers.)

This however entails several practical considerations:\n\n* How many times to run the algorithm?\n* How to choose more fiable solutions?\n* How to represent the results, if multiple solutions could be reasonable?\n* How to estimate the optimal number of clusters, privided multiple solutions?\n* When to give up altogether on clustering / mixture\\-modeling for the given dataset?\n\n**Background:** I am clustering data in the context of [enterotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotype), i.e., assigning microbial compositions to several typical compositional types.\n\n**Update: Gelman\\-Rubin criterion**  \n\nI wonder whether there exist anything in the spirit of [Gelman\\-Rubin criterion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/262037/110833) used in a similar setting: when a mixture model is analyzed with Markov chain Monte Carlo technique.

I'm playing Mid\\-Malzahar, and I get those objectives really fast (sometimes my team mates haven't destroyed any towers yet!). Yes, I know about the danger about pushing the lane and so, but the fact is that I'm very good in killing the towers.\n\nIn the end, I don't know what I do to follow up.

And an AP hero as Malzahar isn't sooo good as jungler.\n\nWhat the best can I do when I won my lane so early?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several problems with answering that:\n\nYou say you don't like helping your teammates because your tower is unprotected. That means you don't think enough about lane dynamics yet. As AP mid, the way you play is basically you push the lane to the enemy tower and go do other stuff (gank other lanes, take a jungle camp, take blue, etc.). You can do that freely because the lane is pushed, the opponent can't destroy your tower since he has to push the lane back first which takes about 30 seconds to a minute until the minions are at your tower, depending on how strong you pushed the lane and how strong the opponents champion can push.  \n\nThat is enough time to go to another lane and help them.  \n\nIf you destroyed the first tower, you can push the lane even further back, giving you even more time to gank other lanes.\n\nGenerally speaking, once you destroyed the tower or gained the ability to insta\\-clear a minion wave, you should spend as little time as possible in your lane and as much time as possible ganking other lanes and then be there just in time to catch the big counterwave coming in range of your tower. In the meantime take your and sometimes even his wraith camp for some bonus farm while you go to top or bottom lane.\n\nAnother way to approach this situation with more defensive mids is to freeze the lane, that means let the lane come to you and tank it far enough away from your tower that it doesn't shoot but close enough that the enemy mid can't farm your minions. Then farm very, very slowly which denies the opponent his farm since he can't reach your minions safely and since he has no tower to back him up, it makes him extremely vulnerable to ganks which can snowball your advantage even further. However, defensive mids will rarely get into this situation in the first place.\n\nHowever, the situation most likely means that the opposing team is just bad, so you could do whatever and still win. It should never occur in a match of equally strong teams of decent skill."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a mid-lane AP champion who has destroyed two enemy towers early in the game, what is the most effective strategy to maintain and extend your advantage?\n\nA) Stay in your lane to protect your tower and continue pushing\nB) Roam to other lanes to help teammates, taking jungle camps along the way\nC) Freeze the lane near your tower to deny the enemy farm\nD) Focus on becoming a jungler to help all lanes equally\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. After destroying two towers in your lane, the most effective strategy is to roam and help other lanes while also taking jungle camps. This approach allows you to:\n\n1. Extend your advantage by helping other lanes succeed\n2. Maintain farm by clearing jungle camps\n3. Apply pressure across the map\n4. Return to your lane in time to clear incoming waves\n\nOption A is incorrect because staying in your lane after destroying towers limits your impact on the game. \n\nOption C, freezing the lane, can be effective with defensive mid-laners but doesn't capitalize on the advantage you've already gained by destroying towers. \n\nOption D is not advisable as AP mid-laners are generally not suited for full-time jungling.\n\nThe key is to understand lane dynamics and use your advantage to impact the entire map, not just your lane."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/11", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/163228", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/61125/"], "docs_id": 163228, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read this line in an [online article](http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-chris-kathy-berman-courant-archives-20170510-story.html):\n\n> And, **outside** a minor paunch and a rapidly expanding billfold, there's nothing heavy about him.\n\n**Outside** here appears to mean \"besides\".

This means that if you are referring to \"music\" in plural, you still call it \"music\" instead of \"musics\" (and you would say \"that music,\" not \"those music\"). Also, in your second sentence, you said \"\\[that is music] from a completely different culture that of your country culture.\" This sentence doesn't grammatically fit together; I suggest saying something like \"that is music from a completely different culture than that of your country's culture,\" because the word \"than\" compares the \"different culture\" and \"your country's culture\" (and the 's after country shows possession).\n\nThe sentence \"How do you feel about this music?\" is a question. You only use the word \"do\" like that in a question. \n\nThe sentence \"I wonder how you feel about this music\" is not question; it is as statement. You are not asking how the person feels about the music, you are simply saying that you wonder how they feel. Since it is not a question, you don't use the word \"do.\"\n\nAlso, I don't know the purpose of your letter, but **if** you are trying to get a response from the person you are addressing the letter to, I would suggest using the question version \"How do you feel about this music?\" If this doesn't apply to your letter just ignore my suggestion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"do\" in sentences is correct?\n\nA) \"Do\" is used in both questions and statements when discussing feelings about music.\nB) \"Do\" is only used in questions, never in statements, regardless of the context.\nC) \"Do\" is used in questions asking about feelings, but not in statements expressing wonder about feelings.\nD) The use of \"do\" is optional in both questions and statements about music preferences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The water below the valve becomes trapped at its original pressure, which was \u03c1g(H+h) before the valve was closed.

We haven\u2019t had any water issues or anything in the basement. I\u2019ve actually never even heard the sump kick on. Any suggestions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main difference of the different insulation related to the water and moisture is that fiberglass is a fabric with lots of small pieces and lots of open air spaces while the others are solid. Fiberglass can take on and hold moisture and is an ideal place for mold to grow. The solid insulation can not absorb water, and does not allow mold to grow within it which is a very desirable trait in higher moisture situations such as basement walls.\n\nThe moisture can and may likely be there and an issue even if there isn't enough water to get to the sump pump. And even if the exterior of the wall and soil is dry, this is because the air in the basement is usually warmer than the concrete basement wall in contact with the cooler ground soil. When moisture in the air contacts the colder surface it can condensate much like water on the outside of a glass of ice water.\n\nI strongly suggest replacing the insulation. It will likely have a higher insulation rating too."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is considering replacing the existing foil-faced fiberglass insulation in their basement with foam board insulation.

Unlike fiberglass, which can absorb moisture and provide an environment for mold to thrive, foam board insulation is solid and does not allow water absorption or mold growth within its structure. This characteristic is particularly important in basements, where moisture issues are common due to the potential for water intrusion and condensation on cool concrete walls. While foam board may also offer other benefits, its moisture resistance is the key factor highlighted in the given context."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/02/21", "source": ["https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5519", "https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 5519, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have very serious doubts from my experience here (albeit, limited).

For efficiency you'll want to gather multiple events for a single update, and you may need to reduce the events in some way (for example, you may have multiple events for a product but only care about the latest).\n\nIn this case separate streams make more sense. You *could* write your consumers to simply discard events that they don't care about. However, you have a fixed bandwidth per reads: 5 transactions or 2MB per second per shard. It's really easy to use up this bandwidth just with consumers that care about all of the records; discarding records could make your system unacceptably laggy (or could push you toward fan\\-out implementations, which you'd find even more complex to manage).\n\n**A consumer consumes multiple event types, in batches**\n\nThis case is similar to the previous, but assumes some sort of inter\\-relatedness between the event types. For example, you want to combine different types of events in a single transaction.\n\nIn this case it might make sense to combine the streams, and rely on related data being written together.

The design goal is to describe a provider API to query a system using various values. Some of them are catalogs resp. code lists. A catalog or code list is a set of key value pairs. There are different systems (at least 3\\) maintaining possibly different code lists. Each system should implement the provider API, whereas each system might have different code list for the same business entity eg. think of colors. One system know \\[(1,'red'),(2,'green')] and another one knows \\[(1,'lightgreen'),(2,'darkgreen'),(3,'red')] etc.\n\nThe access to the different provider API implementations will be encapsulated by a query service, but there is already one candidate which might use at least one provider API directly.\n\nThe current options to design the API discussed are:\n\n1. use an abstract code list in the interface definition: the web service interface defines a well known set of code list which are expected to be used for querying and returning data. Each API provider implementation has to mapped the request and response values from those abstract codelist to the system specific one.\n2. let the query component handle the code list: the encapsulating query service knows the code list set of each provider API implementation and takes care of mapping the input and output to the system specific code lists of the queried system.\n3. do not use code lists in the query definition at all: Just query code lists by a plain string and let the provider API implementation figure out the right value. This might lead to a loose of information and possibly many false positives, due to the fact that the input string could not be canonical mapped to a code list value (eg. green \\-\\> lightgreen or green \\-\\> darkgreen or both)\n\nWhat are your experiences resp. solutions to such a problem?

The key points are:\n\n1. The electric field points from B to A, meaning B is at a lower potential than A.\n2. The electron moves from A to B, which is in the same direction as the electric field. This means it's moving from high to low potential.\n3. According to the textbook statement, this movement results in a negative potential difference.\n4. However, voltmeters are designed by convention to show a positive reading when the positive lead is at a higher potential than the negative lead.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the voltmeter reading is not determined by the electron's movement direction relative to the field.\nOption B is incorrect because while the electron does move from high to low potential, this doesn't determine the voltmeter reading.\nOption C combines two correct concepts but reaches the wrong conclusion about the voltmeter reading.\nOption D is correct because it focuses on the voltmeter convention, which determines the displayed reading regardless of the electron's movement or the field direction."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/09/26", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/83834", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/6793/"], "docs_id": 83834, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a name for the relationship of my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s husband in English?

You have just circumnavigated the programming language / type system globe, arriving on the other side of the world from whence you departed. You have just landed on the border of dynamic language / prototype\\-based object land!\n\nMany dynamic languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP, Python) allow one to extend or change object properties at runtime. \n\nThe extreme form of this is a [prototype based language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) like [Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)) or JavaScript. They\ndo not have classes, strictly speaking. You can do things that look like class\\-based, object\\-oriented programming with inheritance, but the rules are greatly relaxed compared to more sharply\\-defined, class\\-based languages like Java and C\\#.\n\nLangauges like PHP and Python live in the middle ground. They have regular, idiomatic class\\-based systems. But object attributes can be added, changed, or deleted at runtime\\-\\-albeit with some restrictions (like \"except for built\\-in types\") that you don't find in JavaScript.\n\nThe big tradeoff for this dynamism is performance. Forget how strongly or weakly typed the language is, or how well it can be compiled down to machine code. Dynamic objects must be represented as flexible maps/dictionaries, rather than simple structs. This adds overhead to every object access. Some programs go to great lengths to reduce this overhead (e.g. with phantom kwarg assignment and slot\\-based classes in Python), but the extra overhead is usually just par for the course and the price of admission.\n\nGetting back to your design, you're grafting the ability to have dynamic properties onto a subset of your classes. A `Product` can have variable attributes; presumably an `Invoice` or an `Order` would and could not. It's not a bad way to go. It gives you the flexibility to have variation where you need it, while remaining in a strict, disciplined language and type system. On the down side, you are responsible for managing those flexible properties, and you'll probably have to do so through mechanisms that look slightly different from more native attributes. `p.prop('tensile_strength')` rather than `p.tensile_strength`, for instance, and `p.set_prop('tensile_strength', 104.4)` rather than `p.tensile_strength = 104.4`. But I've worked with and built many programs in Pascal, Ada, C, Java and even dynamic languages that used exactly such getter\\-setter access for non\\-standard attribute types; the approach is clearly workable.\n\nBy the by, this tension between static types and a highly varied world is extremely common. An analogous problem is often seen when designing database schema, especially for relational and pre\\-relational data stores. Sometimes it's dealt with by creating \"super\\-rows\" that contain enough flexibility to contain or define the union of all imagined variations, then stuffing any data that comes along into those fields. The [WordPress `wp_posts` table](http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description), for example, has fields like `comment_count`, `ping_status`, `post_parent` and `post_date_gmt` that are only interesting under some circumstances, and that in practice often go blank. Another approach is a very spare, [normalized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) table like `wp_options`, much like your `Property` class. While it requires more explicit management, items in it are rarely blank. Object\\-oriented and document databases (e.g. MongoDB) often have an easier time dealing with changing options, because they can create and set attributes pretty much at will."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an object-oriented programming language, you are designing a system where a User class has many related entities (e.g., orders, files, friends).

Then `FragmentManager#onCreateView` is being called when `Fragment#onCreateView` is called.\n\nWhen `Fragment#onCreateView` is called then the rootview of the `Fragment` is still `R.id.myLayout`, but after the `FragmentManager#onCreateView` has been called, for some reason this method changes the `Id` of the `mView` and `mInnerView` of the `Fragment` in this part of the code:\n\n```\nif (id != 0) {\n    fragment.mView.setId(id);\n}\n\n```\n\nAt this point `fragment.mView` already have an `Id` set \\- the `R.id.myLayout`.\n\nThere is no explanation in the code for why this happens and why it's needed, but fact is that it happens.\n\nFor reference here's a [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/28VQGJxE) of the `FragmentManager#onCreateView` method.\n\n**Now for what I would do**, is to forget about the `Id` `R.id.myLayout` of your `RelativeLayout`.\n\nYou will always be able to get the `RelativeLayout` by doing like this from the `Activity` for instance:\n\n```\nMainActivityFragment fragment = (MainActivityFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.fragment);\nRelativeLayout rootView = (RelativeLayout) fragment.getView();\n\n```\n\nThe `getView` will always return the rootview and it can be cast to the `RelativeLayout`. It's not pretty, but I think that's how it should work.\n\nIf you want to get the `RelativeLayout` from within the `Fragment`, just call `getView` directly and cast it a `RelativeLayout` or make a global variable for the rootview inside the `Fragment` \\- that's at least what we do in our code at my work :\\-)\n\nAlso, if you remove the `Id` of the `Fragment` inside the `activity_main.xml` the `FragmentManager#onCreateView` will still overwrite the current `Id` of your `RelativeLayout` and you won't be able to use `View#findViewById` still.\n\nAs to why Google did this overwriting the `Id` I can't answer, but then again the whole `Fragment` system is a bit shaky in my opinion.\n\nI hope this sheds some light on what is actually happening at least :\\-)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Android development, when using Fragments, what happens to the ID of a Fragment's root view when it's attached to an Activity via XML?\n\nA) The ID remains unchanged and can always be referenced using its original value\nB) The ID is removed entirely, making it impossible to reference the root view\nC) The ID is changed to match the ID of the Fragment tag in the Activity's layout\nD) The ID is randomly generated to ensure uniqueness\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When a Fragment is attached to an Activity via XML, the FragmentManager actually changes the ID of the Fragment's root view to match the ID specified in the Fragment tag within the Activity's layout. This occurs during the Fragment inflation process, specifically in the FragmentManager#onCreateView method. \n\nThis behavior can cause confusion, as the original ID set on the Fragment's root view in its own layout file (e.g., R.id.mylayout) is overwritten with the ID from the Activity's layout (e.g., R.id.fragment). As a result, attempting to find the root view using its original ID (findViewById(R.id.mylayout)) will fail after the Fragment is attached to the Activity.\n\nTo work around this, developers should avoid relying on the ID of the Fragment's root view. Instead, they can access the root view directly using the Fragment's getView() method, or by finding the Fragment itself using the ID from the Activity's layout and then accessing its view.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of Fragment behavior, layout inflation, and the sometimes unexpected interactions between Fragments and Activities in Android development."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/14", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8370", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/218/"], "docs_id": 8370, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just installed Google Notifier (Mac), and I noticed that it's a bit delayed in when it reports an email has arrived.\n\nIt seems that it polls the server every X minutes instead of using push technology.

This approach allows all traffic to be moved upstream to the ISP modem's network, creating a flat network topology where all devices appear to be on the same network.

The router will only be a bottleneck for internet traffic, not for local data transfers.\nC) Downgrading the cabling would reduce potential network speed and is unnecessary.\nD) Connecting all devices to the 1 Gbps router would limit local network speeds and potentially overload the router's CPU with packet processing.\n\nThe key point is that a high-speed switch can handle local traffic at full speed, bypassing the router's limitations for device-to-device communication within the network."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/08", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/279151", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/91086/"], "docs_id": 279151, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use a 30W RGB LED that is in common\\-anode configuration.

For example, take a graded ring $A$ and consider $X \\= Spec A // \\\\mathbb{G}\\_m$ (where the $\\\\mathbb{G}\\_m$\\-action is induced by the grading). The category of quasi\\-coherent sheaves on $X$ is (by fpqc\\-descent) equivalent to that of graded $A$\\-modules and the global sections functor corresponds to taking the zeroth degree of such a graded module. This is clearly exact and thus all higher cohomology groups of all quasi\\-coherent sheaves vanish. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suppose that $\\\\mathcal X$ is an algebraic stack with finite inertia (for example, a separated Deligne\\-Mumford stack); then, by a well\\-known result of Keel and Mori, there exist a moduli space $\\\\pi \\\\colon \\\\mathcal X \\\\to M$. The stack $\\\\mathcal X$ is called *tame* when $\\\\mathrm R^i\\\\pi\\_\\* F \\= 0$ for every quasi\\-coherent sheaf $F$ on $\\\\mathcal X$ and every $i \\> 0$. From the definition it follows easily that tame stacks with affine moduli spaces have the property you require. In characteristic 0, an algebraic stack with finite diagonal is tame if and only if it is Deligne\\-Mumford.\n\nThere are several different characterizations of tame stacks; see the paper \"Tame stacks in positive characteristic\" by Dan Abramovich, Martin Olsson and myself. Using the results in that paper, it is not hard to show that a noetherian algebraic stack with finite inertia has the property you want if and only if it is tame with affine moduli space.\n\n\\[Edit:] here is a proof that if a noetherian algebraic stack $\\\\mathcal X$ with finite inertia has the property you want it is tame with affine moduli space. Let $\\\\mathcal X \\\\to M$ be the moduli space. Let $\\\\mathcal G$ be the residual gerbe over a closed point of $M$; then $\\\\mathcal G$ is closed in $\\\\mathcal X$, so the cohomology of each quasi\\-coherent sheaf on $\\\\mathcal G$ is trivial. The moduli space of $\\\\mathcal G$ is the spectrum of a field, so $\\\\mathcal G$ is tame. This implies that the automorphism group of an object of $\\\\mathcal G$ is linearly reductive. One of the results in the paper implies that an open neighborhood of $\\\\mathcal G$ in $\\\\mathcal X$ is tame.

Can someone help me understand those block diagrams.\n\nI have seen some server board PCBs. In that, I have seen many DIMM Slots. Like, I have 12 DIMM Sockets. 6 sockets were black in color and 6 were blue in color. Does this difference indicate different channels, if not, why is there a difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably missed the concept of hierarchy.\n\nLook at page 5: \"DIMM, rank, bank, array form a hierarchy in the storage organization\".\n\n1 DIMM can have more than 1 ranks. One rank can have more than 1 banks, and so on. Some are vertical elements, some are horizontal elements.\n\nConsider memory is organized cells, each cell a bit (value 0 or 1\\), and multiple cells in array; so to read the value stored in one of those cells (or to store a value in a cell), you must provide a \"row \\* column\" cell address. Because there are limits to the number of rows and columns, as well as efficiency problems when the array is too big, the hierarchy depth has been increased adding more dimensions. So instead of having just rows and columns... you have rows, columns, banks, and ranks. A full address to find the value in a cell would be: \"row \\* column \\* bank \\* rank\".\n\nLet's make an example: you have a 32 bit DRAM controller. One bit is needed to say if the number is negative or positive; so you have 31 bits left for the numbers, this means that the biggest number it can use in one cycle is 2^31 (2,147,483,647\\). To use bigger numbers it must wait 2 cycles (the access time doubles! And the computer would halve its speed; and this would be unacceptable). A cell address is a number as well, and this means that the highest cell address is 2,147,483,647\\. In other words, if you had a simple row of cells, you would not be able to address more than 2,147,483,647 bits (i.e. : less than 256MB!). So instead of having a simple row of cells, they used an array: \"rows \\* columns\". This means that you can have \"2,147,483,647 \\* 2,147,483,647\" cells (trillions of bits can be addressed). **If you add more depth to the hierarchy, you can get more addresses for cells.**\n\nThis is an over simplified example. The real thing is much different. But I wanted to show you **one of the advantages of increasing the heiarchy depth: increased address space**.\n\n**Another advantage is the speed, because of parallelism.** So, let's say that your cpu can read 2 values in 1 cycle. But your ram chip is organized in rows and columns, and to read one cell it needs to turn on (ie: give electricity) to 1 full row and 1 full column only, so that at the crossing of that row and column, a single cell turns on ... and allows you to access its value. How are you going to concurrently access 2 cells that are on totally different rows and columns, if you can turn on only 1 row and 1 column at once? **One of those hierarchy levels could be used for this purpose, instead of using it to increase the address space. And here we go: channels.** If you place data on different DIMMs, connected to 2 different channels, you can use both DIMMs at the same time, independently from one another. In this way your CPU can access both DIMMs at the same time, and get 2 values in 1 cycle.\n\nTo conclude: memory is organized in a multi dimensional matrix so that it is possible to work around all the limits (bandwidth, address size, electric needs, and so on) without compromising on performance. If you go back to your slides, you'll see that ranks, banks, arrays... are just unique names given to those dimensions.\n\nColors on DIMM slots can be anything. Can be the channel, but can be something totally different, example: some boards can have both DDR3 and DDR4, and because those two families have different voltages... you'd better not place the lower voltage one into a higher voltage slot, or magic smoke will puff your eyes. This doesn't happen nowadays, because every ram generation has a different number of pins and/or notch positions. But some bad DIMM/slot combos can still hurt your wallet... so pay attention anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A computer system has 8 DIMM slots, with 4 slots colored blue and 4 slots colored black.

In dual-channel memory configurations, it's common for motherboard manufacturers to use different colors to visually distinguish between memory channels. This helps users correctly install memory modules to take advantage of dual-channel performance. While color coding can sometimes indicate other factors (like different RAM generations or voltages), in the context of a system supporting dual-channel memory, it's most likely that the color difference represents the two separate channels.

I'm assuming this is homework, so my first advice is that you catch up on the expected reading!\n\nSecond, the \"significance level\" has a different meaning depending on whether you are working within the dichotomous hypothesis testing framework of Neyman or the significance testing framework of Fisher. In the former case the significance level is an unfortunate phrase indicating the alpha level or 'size' of the test, and it might be 0\\.05 as you indicate, but only if that level is explicitly decided prior to the data being analysed. In the latter case the significance level refers to the observed significance level, the p\\-value. (That distinction is not always observed by introductory stats texts and may be unknown to some instructors.)\n\nNext, if you are doing a Student's t\\-test then the test statistic is t. I expect that the question would be answered by an explanation of the meaning of the t statistic and how it is calculated for the particular experiment.\n\nNext, the t\\-test that you have calculated using R is a Welch's variant. It relaxes the assumption of the original Student's t\\-test that the variances of the populations are equal. The way it is calculated leads to fractional degrees of freedom. For a conventional Student's t\\-test your degrees of freedom would be n1\\-1 \\+ n2\\-1\\.\n\nFinally, the distribution that you have been asked for is the distribution of t under the assumption that the parameter of interest (mean difference) is equal to the null hypothesised value (usually zero, but it can be any value desired).

Under the null hypothesis (that there is no significant difference between Michael's and Bernard's average working hours), the test statistic follows a t-distribution with 91.778 degrees of freedom.

The conducting shell will have an inner surface with induced negative charge and an outer surface with induced positive charge, creating a zero net electric field inside the conductor.

What is the primary reason for this limitation?\n\nA) The player is using an outdated version of Minecraft (1.7.10)\nB) The tutorial followed was for AE1, not AE2\nC) AE2 does not currently support integration with LP request pipes\nD) The chest is not properly connected to the AE2 interface\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, AE2 currently doesn't support integration with Logistics Pipes' request pipe functionality. This is a known limitation, as evidenced by the reference to Issue 21 on the Applied Energistics 2 GitHub repository. While the player can see AE2 items through the LP request pipe, the reverse is not possible due to this lack of support in AE2.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Minecraft version, while older, is not the primary cause of the integration issue.\nAnswer B is plausible but incorrect.

A variable in a programming language is not an \"object\", it's a \"name\" for an object, which is only seen by the compiler. Using variable names makes it possible for a programmer to refer to multiple data objects in a coherent way so it is clear which data object each part of the code refers to. Once a program is fully compiled into machine code, there are no longer variable names so to speak. Unless \"debugging info\" is included by the compiler, it is not possible to tell what name was originally used for a data object solely by inspecting the compiled machine code. \n\nSimilarly, syntactic variables in mathematics \\-\\- expressions such as \"x\", \"t\", \"Q\", etc. \\-\\- are not mathematical objects, they are names that mathematicians use in their writing to refer to mathematical objects. Just as a compiled program no longer has variable names, the mathematical objects themselves don't have variable names. \n\nThe definition of a variable is, foremost, a definition as part of the language of mathematics. Most mathematics is carried out in natural language, which has no formal grammar. In logic, we sometimes study formalized languages, which do have formal grammars. In these languages, a certain collection of expressions are chosen at the outset to be the \"variables\". The semantics of the formal languages allow these variables to refer to various mathematics objects."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between mathematical variables and the mathematical objects they represent?\n\nA) Variables are intrinsic properties of mathematical objects that cannot be separated from them.\n\nB) Variables are purely symbolic constructs with no connection to actual mathematical objects.\n\nC) Variables are names used by mathematicians to refer to mathematical objects, similar to how variable names in programming languages refer to data objects.\n\nD) Variables are permanent labels attached to mathematical objects that persist even in formal mathematical proofs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the relationship between variables and mathematical objects as described in the given text. Variables in mathematics, like variable names in programming, are not the objects themselves but rather names or labels used by mathematicians to refer to mathematical objects in a coherent way. They are part of the language of mathematics, used for clear communication and reasoning, but are not inherent to the mathematical objects themselves.\n\nOption A is incorrect because variables are not intrinsic properties of mathematical objects; they are external labels used by mathematicians.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while variables are indeed symbolic, they do have a connection to mathematical objects as they are used to refer to them.\n\nOption D is incorrect because variables are not permanent labels that persist in formal proofs.

More generally, can one describe the set of such $\\\\alpha$ (empty/non\\-empty, finite/infinite etc.) if one is given $f$?\n\nExamples:\n\n* $f(x)\\=\\-x$: These are precisely the square roots of algebraic numbers $\\\\beta$ such that there is no square root of $\\\\beta$ in $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\beta)$. There are infinitely many $\\\\alpha$ and even infinitely many of degree $2$.\n* $f(x)\\=x^2$: These are precisely the roots of unity of odd order, since $H(\\\\alpha)\\=H(\\\\alpha^2\\)\\=H(\\\\alpha)^2$ implies $H(\\\\alpha)\\=1$, so $\\\\alpha$ a root of unity. Here $H(\\\\alpha)$ is the absolute multiplicative Weil height of $\\\\alpha$. There are infinitely many $\\\\alpha$, but only finitely many of degree $\\\\leq D$ for any $D$.\n* $f(x)\\=x\\+1$: There is no $\\\\alpha$. If there was and $P(x)$ was its minimal polynomial, then $P(x\\+1\\)$ would be another irreducible polynomial, vanishing at $\\\\alpha$, with the same leading coefficient and hence $P(x\\+1\\)\\=P(x)$. Looking at the coefficients of the second highest power of $x$ now leads to a contradiction. Analogously for $f(x)\\=x\\+a$ if $a$ is any non\\-zero rational number.\n\nSo the existence of such an $\\\\alpha$ and the set of all possible $\\\\alpha$ seem to depend rather intricately on $f(x)$, which seems interesting to me. As I found no discussion of this question in the literature, I post it here.\n\nUPDATE: Firstly thanks to all who have contributed so far! As Eric Wofsey pointed out, any solution $\\\\alpha$ will satisfy $f^n(\\\\alpha)\\=\\\\alpha$ for some $n\\>1$, where $f^n$ is the $n$\\-th iterate of $f$. So one should consider solutions of the equation $f^n(x)\\-x\\=0$ or $f^p(x)\\-x\\=0$ for $p$ prime.\n\nIf the degree of $f$ is at least 2, one can always find irrational such solutions $\\\\alpha$ with $f(\\\\alpha) \\\\neq \\\\alpha$ by the answer of Joe Silverman. However, for his proof to work, we'd need to know that $f^k(\\\\alpha)$ and $\\\\alpha$ are conjugate for some $k$ with $0 \\< k \\<p$. I'm not enough of an expert to follow through with his hints for proving this, but if someone does, I'd be very happy about an answer!\n\nIf the degree of $f$ is 1, then $f$ is a M\u00f6bius transformation and all $f^n$ will have the same fixed points as $f$ (so there's no solution) unless $f$ is of finite order. In that case, if $f(x) \\\\neq x$, the order is 2, 3, 4 or 6 (see [http://home.wlu.edu/\\~dresdeng/papers/nine.pdf](http://home.wlu.edu/~dresdeng/papers/nine.pdf)). By the same reference, in the latter three cases, $f$ is conjugate to $\\\\frac{\\-1}{x\\+1}$, $\\\\frac{x\\-1}{x\\+1}$ or $\\\\frac{2x\\-1}{x\\+1}$, so it suffices to consider these $f$, which give rise to the minimal polynomials $x^3\\-nx^2\\-(n\\+3\\)x\\-1$ (closely related to the polynomial in GNiklasch's answer), $x^4\\+nx^3\\-6x^2\\-nx\\+1$ and $x^6\\-2nx^5\\+5(n\\-3\\)x^4\\+20x^3\\-5nx^2\\+2(n\\-3\\)x\\+1$, if my calculations are correct. If the order is 2, the map is of the form $\\\\frac{\\-x\\+a}{bx\\+1}$ or $\\\\frac{a}{x}$, which leads to $x^2\\+(bn\\-a)x\\+n$ or $x^2\\+nx\\+a$ respectively. So this case is somewhat degenerate, which explains the unusual behavior of $f(x)\\=\\-x$ and $f(x)\\=x\\+1$ above.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A first observation is that the field $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\alpha)$ must admit a non\\-identity automorphism $\\\\sigma$, since applying a rational function to $\\\\alpha$ will not take us outside this field. Given such $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\sigma$, you can immediately read off an $f$ by expressing $\\\\sigma(\\\\alpha)$ as a $\\\\mathbb{Q}$\\-linear combination of $1, \\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2,\\\\ldots$, and there'll be additional non\\-polynomial (rational) expressions in terms of $\\\\alpha$. This leads to plenty of examples, but now we want to turn this around and start from a given $f$.\n\nNext, the application of $f$ can be iterated. If $g$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha$ over the rationals, $g \\\\circ f$ will be a rational function whose numerator vanishes at $\\\\alpha$, hence is divisible in $\\\\mathbb{Q}\\[x]$ by $g$, hence vanishes at $f(\\\\alpha)$ as well, so $g(f(f(\\\\alpha))) \\= (g\\\\circ f)(f(\\\\alpha))\\=0$, so $f(f(\\\\alpha))$ is another conjugate of $\\\\alpha$, and so forth.\n\nSince there are only finitely many conjugates to choose from, some iterate $f^{\\\\circ n}(\\\\alpha)$ must return to $\\\\alpha$: in other words, $\\\\alpha$ will be a root of (the numerator of) $f^{\\\\circ n}(x)\\-x$ for some integer $n \\> 1$. (This leads to another argument ruling out $f(x)\\=x\\+1$ and friends, as has been noted in the comments.)\n\nSo in many cases you'll be able, given $f$, to find the $\\\\alpha$ by picking an $n$ and factoring the numerator of $f^{\\\\circ n}(x)\\-x$ into irreducible polynomials.\n\nHowever, the $n$\\-th iterate of $f$ might be the identity function $x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ *already*, and the numerator to be factored might thus be zero! This happens in your first example $f(x)\\=\\-x$ with $n\\=2$, or with $$f(x)\\=1/x$$ again with $n\\=2$ which leads to reciprocal minimal polynomials $g(x)\\=x^{\\\\mathrm{deg}(g)}g(1/x)$, or with (e.g.) $$f(x)\\=1\\-1/x$$ with $n\\=3$ which gives rise (among other things) to what D. Shanks in 1974 called *The Simplest Cubic Fields* ([Math.Comp. **28**, 1137\\-1152](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1974-28-128/S0025-5718-1974-0352049-8/S0025-5718-1974-0352049-8.pdf)), with $g(x)\\=x^3\\+ax^2\\-(a\\+3\\)x\\+1$.

Assuming a 3.3V output, calculate the current provided during each pulse and determine which of the following applications would be most suitable for this energy harvesting setup.\n\nA) Powering a continuous LED display that requires 50mA at 3.3V\nB) Charging a small battery for periodic sensor readings\nC) Running a small motor that needs 100mA continuously\nD) Powering a Wi-Fi module that requires 200mA for 1 second every minute\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nFirst, we need to calculate the current provided during each pulse:\nPower = Voltage * Current\n100mW = 3.3V * I\nI = 100mW / 3.3V \u2248 30mA\n\nThe module provides 30mA for 80ms at 3.3V.\n\nA) is incorrect because the LED display requires continuous power at 50mA, which this setup cannot provide.\n\nB) is correct because the intermittent nature of the energy harvesting matches well with charging a battery for periodic use.\n\nC) is incorrect as the motor needs more current (100mA) continuously than the module can provide.\n\nD) is incorrect because the Wi-Fi module requires more current (200mA) for a longer duration (1 second) than what's available from a single pulse.\n\nThe energy harvesting setup is best suited for applications that can work with intermittent, low-power pulses, making battery charging for periodic sensor readings the most appropriate choice."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/19", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/270948", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/161948/"], "docs_id": 270948, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been following this tutorial \u2013\n[Howto Configure OpenVPN Server\\-Client on Ubuntu 15\\.04](http://linoxide.com/ubuntu-how-to/configure-openvpn-server-client-ubuntu-15-04) \u2013\nto set up OpenVPN on my Ubuntu 15\\.04 VM.\u00a0\nI have followed it through and through,\nand am kind of stuck with the client config file.\n\nHere is the client.conf file given in the example:\n\n```\ndev tun\nproto udp\n\n# IP and Port of remote host with OpenVPN server\nremote 111.222.333.444 1194\n\nresolv-retry infinite\n\nca /etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt\ncert /etc/openvpn/keys/client.crt\nkey /etc/openvpn/keys/client.key\ntls-client\ntls-auth /etc/openvpn/keys/ta.key 1\nauth SHA1\ncipher BF-CBC\nremote-cert-tls server\ncomp-lzo\npersist-key\npersist-tun\n\nstatus openvpn-status.log\nlog /var/log/openvpn.log\nverb 3\nmute 20\n\n```\n\nSo I am guessing remote IP would be the public IP of my server and that I would need to forward port 1194 on my router. However where I define the ca, cert and key in the conf file, if I was using this on an Android device would I need to change the path to reflect where these files are on the Android device or is the example given correct?\n\nI will be generating the client key to be used on both Android and iOS devices using the OpenVPN client. Would this also work on Windows?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: `exec` is often used in shell scripts which mainly act as wrappers for starting other binaries. For example:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif stuff;\n    EXTRA_OPTIONS=\"-x -y -z\"\nelse\n    EXTRA_OPTIONS=\"-a foo\"\nfi\n\nexec /usr/local/bin/the.real.binary $EXTRA_OPTIONS \"$@\"\n\n```\n\nso that after the wrapper is finished running, the \"real\" binary takes over and there is no longer any trace of the wrapper script that temporarily occupied the same slot in the process table. The \"real\" binary is a direct child of whatever launched it instead of a grandchild.\n\nYou mention also I/O redirection in your question. That is quite a different use case of `exec` and has nothing to do with replacing the shell with another process. When `exec` has no arguments, like so:\n\n```\nexec 3>>/tmp/logfile\n\n```\n\nthen I/O redirections on the command line take effect in the current shell process, but the current shell process keeps running and moves on to the next command in the script."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of shell scripting and OpenVPN configuration, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) The 'exec' command in shell scripts is primarily used for I/O redirection and has no effect on process replacement.\n\nB) When configuring an OpenVPN client on an Android device, the paths to CA, cert, and key files in the client.conf file must always be changed to reflect the Android file system.\n\nC) The 'exec' command without arguments in a shell script causes the script to terminate immediately.\n\nD) The 'exec' command with arguments in a shell script replaces the current shell process with the specified command, making the new process a direct child of the script's parent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because 'exec' has multiple uses, including process replacement, which is its primary use when given with arguments.\nB is incorrect because the paths in the OpenVPN client configuration may need to be adjusted depending on where the files are stored on the Android device, but it's not always necessary.\nC is incorrect because 'exec' without arguments does not terminate the script; it applies I/O redirections to the current shell.\nD is correct because when 'exec' is used with arguments in a shell script, it replaces the current shell process with the specified command, making it a direct child of whatever launched the script."}}
