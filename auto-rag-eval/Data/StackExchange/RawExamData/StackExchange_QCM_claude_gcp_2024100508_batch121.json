This effectively means that without scaling, the near infrared region will be much more dominant in your model than the visible spectral region.\n\nThis scaling only makes sense when you average over a single band. You'll want to know how far a particular pixel is from its mean, not the average reflectance of a pixel and how far each band is from that (which would be the case in the second formula for the mean you showed)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a hyperspectral image processing workflow, you need to scale your data before applying a machine learning algorithm. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate and why?\n\nA) Scale each band individually using (x - mean(band)) / std(band)\nB) Scale the entire dataset using (x - mean(all pixels)) / std(all pixels)\nC) No scaling is necessary for hyperspectral data\nD) Scale using (x - min(band)) / (max(band) - min(band))\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is the most appropriate approach for scaling hyperspectral data before applying machine learning algorithms. This method scales each band individually, which is important because different spectral regions can have vastly different ranges of reflectance values. For example, in vegetated areas, the near-infrared region typically has much higher variation in reflectance compared to the visible region.\n\nBy scaling each band separately, you ensure that all bands contribute equally to the machine learning model, preventing regions with naturally higher variation (like near-infrared) from dominating the analysis. This approach allows the model to consider the relative importance of each band without bias from their original scales.\n\nOption B is incorrect because scaling the entire dataset together would not account for the differences between spectral regions and could still result in some bands dominating others.\n\nOption C is incorrect because many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features, and not scaling hyperspectral data could lead to biased results.\n\nOption D, while a valid normalization technique (often called min-max scaling), is not as robust as the z-score normalization suggested in option A, especially for datasets that might contain outliers."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/02", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/194059", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/91825/"], "docs_id": 194059, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I picked up a delivery at Gorbachev Station to be delivered to Sirius, but I can't jump there as I don't have a permit.

You can also avoid the creation of your 250mb buffer, by using `uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest` and then create an `NSInputStream` subclass that just keeps providing more data until you tell it to stop. You can implement `URLSession:task:didSendBodyData:totalBytesSent:totalBytesExpectedToSend:` to monitor the progress of your upload (so you can presumably monitor the speed with which data is being sent).\n\nAnyway, to create the upload request:\n\n```\n@interface ViewController () <NSURLSessionDelegate, NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) CustomStream *inputStream;\n\n@end\n\n@implementation ViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    self.inputStream = [[CustomStream alloc] init];\n\n    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:kURLString];\n    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];\n    [request setHTTPMethod:@\"POST\"];\n\n    NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];\n    NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:configuration delegate:self delegateQueue:nil];\n\n    NSURLSessionUploadTask *task = [session uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest:request];\n\n    [task resume];\n\n    // I don't know how you want to finish the upload, but I'm just going \n    // to stop it after 10 seconds\n\n    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(10.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        self.inputStream.finished = YES;\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\nYou obviously have to implement the appropriate delegate methods:\n\n```\n#pragma mark - NSURLSessionTaskDelegate\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task didSendBodyData:(int64_t)bytesSent totalBytesSent:(int64_t)totalBytesSent totalBytesExpectedToSend:(int64_t)totalBytesExpectedToSend\n{\n    NSLog(@\"%lld %lld %lld\", bytesSent, totalBytesSent, totalBytesExpectedToSend);\n}\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task needNewBodyStream:(void (^)(NSInputStream *bodyStream))completionHandler\n{\n    completionHandler(self.inputStream);\n}\n\n- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session task:(NSURLSessionTask *)task didCompleteWithError:(NSError *)error\n{\n    NSLog(@\"%s: error = %@;

But this doesn't work well with a web/web.api service which is based on stateless calls to a service.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much however, as its really just a naming issue and can be resolved by including the service objects in your design. ie rather than Purchasing an Order (`Order.Purchase()`), a Till Completes an Order (`Till.Complete(order)`)\n\nProblem \\#1 \n\n> \"if a column is modified in the table, the classes in repository and\n>  domain layers all need re\\-work.\"\n\nThis is as it should be, The database stored the models, so if you change one you should change the other and vice versa.\n\nIf you are working with a legacy database system you can get around the problem to some extent by having the repository call stored procedures rather than the tables directly. This gives you an (additional) abstraction layer between the tables and the models\n\nProblem \\#2\n\n> communication between these layers take place with managers which have\n>  been resolved as below, where Container is static\n\nThis is a bit bad. You should use a Factory class to instantiate your web layer, (im assuming C\\# mvc Controllers?) which knows about the container and retrieves and injects the required classes.

Additionally, the DBContext is being stored in session variables and reinitialized with each request. A better approach would be to hide the manager classes and DBContext within the repository layer, improving encapsulation. Furthermore, using a Factory class to instantiate the web layer components (like Controllers in MVC) would allow for proper dependency injection and avoid the need for static references.

The database should be for storing \"data\" (among the usual CRUD functionality and ACID properties), not for storing procedures to encapsulate the entire database. A few reasons why this is a bad idea include:\n\n* slow tests (assuming you are writing tests)\n* possibly harder to test (assuming you are writing tests)\n* potentially large effort required if switching DBMSs, or in other words perhaps being tied to a single DBMS vendor\n* effort or even possibility of switching to some non\\-SQL\\-based vendor or mechanism to store data\n\nHowever, you should also consider how \"likely\" or not that the above things may happen during the lifecycle of your project when making your decision."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is debating whether to move all database operations to stored procedures.

First, using stored procedures for all database interactions can lead to slower tests, as tests would need to interact with the database rather than using in-memory data or mocks. Second, it may make testing more difficult, as it could be harder to isolate and test specific database operations. Additionally, relying heavily on stored procedures could tie the application to a specific database vendor, making it more challenging to switch database management systems in the future.

The information provided shows that the E-field strength is proportional to [1/D^2 - 1/D^4 + 1/D^6], while the H-field strength is proportional to [1/D^2 + 1/D^4].

While freedom is the obvious motivation, he again focuses on the action and the attention of the moment, rather than the result of success.\n\n> If any enterprising reporter had ever asked me why I broke out of jail, I suppose that's what I would have said: \"Because I was in.\" But also, you know, because there's a thrill that comes from breaking out of jail, after years of the most meticulous planning, with everybody watching you, against all the odds, that is like nothing else in the world.\n\nTLDR: He compares money from bank robberies to chips won gambling, but says it's not the reason he kept robbing banks."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to Willie Sutton's explanation in his book \"Where the Money Was,\" what was his primary motivation for robbing banks, and how did he view the money he obtained?\n\nA) He robbed banks primarily for financial gain, viewing the money as a means to achieve a luxurious lifestyle.\nB) His main motivation was the thrill of the act itself, and he saw the money as merely a byproduct, likening it to chips in gambling.\nC) Sutton robbed banks out of necessity to support his family, considering the money as essential for survival.\nD) He was motivated by a desire for fame and notoriety, seeing the stolen money as a way to gain media attention.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Willie Sutton explicitly states that he robbed banks because he enjoyed the experience, describing it as making him feel \"more alive.\" He compares the money he obtained to chips in gambling, indicating that it was not his primary motivation. The phrase \"But to me the money was the chips, that's all\" suggests that the money was secondary to the thrill of the robbery itself.

So, to clarify for you, SovereignSun, here is how I, as a native speaker, would interpret the two statements:\n\n> \"He is not one of us.\" (He is not in our group.)\n> \n> \n> \"He is none of us.\" (The person whom you are looking for is not here.)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the difference between \"not one\" and \"none\" in the context of the sentences \"He is not one of us\" and \"He is none of us\"?\n\nA) \"Not one\" and \"none\" are always interchangeable and convey the same meaning in these sentences.\n\nB) \"Not one\" indicates non-membership in a group, while \"none\" suggests the complete absence of the person being sought.\n\nC) \"None\" is a more formal way of expressing \"not one\" and should be preferred in academic writing.\n\nD) \"Not one\" is grammatically incorrect, and \"none\" should always be used in such contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

However, I don't see how the result follows without using something fancy. Is there an obvious or nice proof I'm missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 7 years ago I wrote in an unfinished paper a proof of this result; I didn't know then if it was original but it indeed seems to be known to a number of specialists although I'm not aware of a written complete proof. Since I don't want anymore to complete this paper, I reproduce the proof here (not self\\-contained, relying on \\[LW] below) as Proposition 5; possibly Uri has a more direct approach. I include closely related Proposition 1, which was my original goal.\n\n**Proposition 1**\n*Let $G$ be a compact group (not necessarily Lie). Consider the action by $G$ by conjugation on $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ (the space of subgroups of $G$, endowed with the Chabauty topology). Then the orbits of $G\\_0$ (connected component of 1\\) coincide with the connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$.*\n\nAs a corollary, for $G$ a compact group, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if $G\\_0$ is central in $G$ (equivalently, $G/Z(G)$ is totally disconnected), a result obtained in \\[FG]. More generally, it can be checked that for an arbitrary locally compact group $G$, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if either totally disconnected, or $G$ is pointwise elliptic with $G\\_0$ central. ($G$ pointwise elliptic means that every single element generates a cyclic subgroup with compact closure.)\n\n**Lemma 2**\n*Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $F$ be a finite group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $F\\\\to G$.*\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)$ can be described as a real algebraic variety, so has finitely many components. By \\[LW], all homomorphisms in a given component are conjugate under $G\\_0$.\n\\\\end{proof}\n\n**Lemma 3**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $S$ be a connected compact semisimple Lie group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $S\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(S,G)$ is canonically identified with the space of Lie algebra homomorphisms $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}$, which is an algebraic variety as well, so has finitely many connected components. So we can again use \\[LW].\n\n**Lemma 4**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $D$ be a connected compact abelian Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $D\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nAny such homomorphism maps into a maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate \\[Bourbaki, Groupes et Alg\u00e8bres de Lie, Chap 9, \u00a72\\.2]. This reduces to the case when $G$ is a torus, but then the result just follows from the fact that $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^a,(\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^b)\\\\simeq\\\\mathbf{Z}^{ab}$, which is countable.\n\n**Lemma 5**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed connected subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nSince there are finitely many isomorphism types of compact semisimple groups in a given dimension, we can fix this type, so by Lemma 3, it is enough to consider the set of closed connected subgroups whose semisimple part is a given subgroup $S$. Therefore, it is enough to count conjugacy classes of closed abelian connected subgroups in $N(S)/S$, where $N(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the normalizer, and Lemma 4 applies. \n\n**Proposition 6**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nBy Lemma 5, we can consider those subgroups for which $H\\_0\\=L$ is given. So it is enough to count conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $N(L)/L$, there are countably many because of Lemma 2\\.\n\n*Proof of Proposition 1*\nWe begin with the case when $G$ is a Lie group. Since $G\\_0$ has finite index in $G$, Proposition 6 implies that there are countably many $G\\_0$\\-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Clearly, it is invariant under conjugation by $G\\_0$. We just obtained that the quotient of $C$ by the action of $G\\_0$ is countable. It is also a compact connected Hausdorff space, so is reduced to a point (it is Hausdorff because the acting group is compact, see \\[Bourbaki, Topologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, III, \u00a74\\.1]. This means that $G\\_0$ acts transitively on each connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$, and we are done.\n\nNow let us deal with a general compact group $G$. (It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is countable). We write $G$ as a projective limit of compact Lie groups $G/K\\_i$. Clearly, if two elements $H,H'$ of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ are conjugate under $G\\_0$, then they lie in the same component. Conversely, suppose they belong to the same connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Then since $K\\_i$ is compact, the projection map $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{S}(G/K\\_i)$ is continuous. Because of the case of Lie groups, there exists $g\\_i\\\\in G\\_0$ such that $(g\\_iHg\\_i^{\\-1}K\\_i\\=H'K\\_i)$ (we use the fact that the inverse image of the unit component of $G/K\\_i$ is the unit component of $G$). Let $g$ be a limit point of $(g\\_i)$. If $h\\\\in H$, then $g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}$ can be written as $h'\\_ik\\_i$ with $h'\\_i\\\\in H'$ and $k\\_i\\\\in K\\_i$. Necessarily $k\\_i\\\\to 1$, so $h'\\_i\\=g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}k\\_i^{\\-1}$ also converges, necessarily to an element $h'$ of $H'$. We have $ghg^{\\-1}\\=h'$. This proves that $gHg^{\\-1}\\\\subset H'$, and the converse inclusion $g^{\\-1}H'g\\\\subset H'$ is strictly similar.\n\n\\[FG] S. Fisher, P. Gartside.

However I fail to connect these together as REST is quite CRUD\\-like and event sourcing is task based. I was wondering how can you designed the creation of commands based on requests to REST server. Consider this example:\n\nWith REST you can put a new state to the resource called File. In one request you can send new file name, you can change the parent folder and/or change owner of the file and so on.\n\nHow to construct the server so I can use event sourcing. I was thinking about these possibilities:\n\n1. Determine on server which fields were changed and create appropriate commands (`RenameFileCommand`, `MoveFileCommand`, `ChangeOwnerCommand`, ...) and dispatch these individually. However in this setup, each of the command can fail leaving others out of transaction and thus out of \"atomic\" change to the resource.\n2. Dispatch only one command (`UpdateFileCommand`) and in the command handler, more precisely in the aggregate, determine which fields were changed and send individual events instead (`FileRenamedEvent`, `FileMovedEvent`, `OwnerChangedEvent`, ...)\n3. This one I don't like at all: In the request to the server I would specify in the headers which command to use, because the UI is still task based (but communication is done via REST). However it will fail in any other use of REST communication (e.g. in external apps) as they are not bound to change only the one field in one request. Also I bring quite a big coupling into the UI, REST, and ES\\-based backend.\n\nWhich one would you prefer or is there any better way to handle this?\n\nSide note: app written in Java and Axon Framework for event\\-sourcing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you may have a user\\-process to implementation mismatch here.\n\nFirst: will a user honestly want to perform *multiple* changes to a file simultaneously?\nA rename (which may or may not include a change of path?), change of ownership, and perhaps change of file contents (for sake of argument) seem like separate actions.\n\nLets take the case where the answer is \"yes\" \\- your users really do want to make these changes simultaneously.\n\nIn that case, I'd strongly recommend against any implementation that sends multiple events \\- `RenameFileCommand`, `MoveFileCommand`, `ChangeOwnerCommand` \\- to represent this **single** user intent.\n\nWhy? Because events can fail. Maybe its extremely rare, but your user submitted an operation that looked atomic \\- if a single one of the downstream events fails, then your application state is now invalid.\n\nYou are also inviting race hazards on a resource that is clearly shared between each of the event handlers. You will need to write \"ChangeOwnerCommand\" in such a way that the file name and file path do not matter, because they could be out of date by the time the command is received. \n\nWhen implementing a non\\-event driven restful system with moving and renaming files, I prefer to ensure consistency by using something like an eTag system \\- ensure that the version of the resource being edited is the version that the user last retrieved, and fail if it has been modified since then. But if you are dispatching multiple commands for this single user operation, you will need to increment your resource version after each command \\- so you have no way to know that the resource the user is editing really is the same version as the resource they last read.\n\nWhat I mean by that is \\- what if someone else performs another operation on the file at nearly the same time. The 6 commands could stack up in any order. If we had just 2 atomic commands, the earlier command could succeed and the later command could fail \"resource has been modified since it was last retrieved\". But there is no protection against this when the commands are not atomic, so system consistency is violated.\n\nInterestingly there is a movement toward something like event based architecture in REST, called \"Rest without PUT\", recommended in the [Thoughtworks technology radar, Jan 2015](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/rest-without-put). There is a considerably longer blog about [Rest without PUT here](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rest-api-design-resource-modeling).\n\nEssentially, the idea is that POST, PUT, DELETE and GET are fine for small applications, but when you need to start assuming how put and post and delete might be interpreted at the other end, you introduce coupling. (e.g. \"when I DELETE the resource associated with my bank account, the account should be closed\") And the solution proposed is to treat REST in a more Event sourced way. i.e. Lets POST the user intent as a single event resource.\n\nThe other case is simpler. If your users don't want to do all those operations simultaneously, don't let them. POST an event for each user intent. Now you can use etag versioning on your resources.\n\nAs for the other applications which are using a very different API to your resources. That smells like trouble. Can you construct a facade of the old API on top of your RESTful API and point them at the facade? i.e. expose a service that performs multiple updates to a file in sequence via the REST server?\n\nIf you neither build the RESTful interface on top of the old solution, nor build a facade of the old interface on top of the REST solution, and attempt to maintain both APIs pointing at a shared data resource, you will experience major headaches."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software architect is designing a system that needs to integrate Event Sourcing with a RESTful API.

It maintains atomicity of user operations, preventing partial updates that could lead to inconsistent states.\n2. It aligns well with event sourcing principles by treating each operation as a distinct event.\n3. It avoids race conditions and versioning issues that could occur with multiple fine-grained commands.\n4. It doesn't introduce tight coupling between the UI and backend, unlike option C.\n5. It follows the \"Rest without PUT\" concept, which is recommended for more complex applications to reduce assumptions about how operations are interpreted.\n\nOptions A and B both risk inconsistency due to potential failures in individual commands or events.

You have to make sure you don't exceed the maximum current, and the fast energy dump can't heat the die too much.\n\nThe first is obvious. Take the maximum capacitor voltage, divide it by the maximum allowed FET current, and that is the total series resistance needed. In theory, the cap's ESR and the FET's on\\-resistance contribute to the total series resistance. However, those two are usually specified as maximums that will not be exceeded, so you can't count on minimum values. The safe thing to do is to size the resistor as if it were there only series resistance.\n\nOnce you know the current is limited, you have to make sure the FET doesn't get too hot. Here you probably need to do some guessing and derating. The datasheet will tell you the maximum continuous dissipation the FET can handle for whatever conditions of cooling and heat\\-sinking you set up. However, it doesn't usually tell you how much energy it takes just to get to a particular temperature. You can exceed maximum continuous dissipation for a short term when starting from cold, but it's often not specified how much more dissipation for how long. Use common sense and be conservative.\n\nOne strategy is to have the resistor dissipate most of the cap's energy. In this case you use the FET's maximum guaranteed on resistance. The fraction of the total energy dissipated by each series element is its resistance divided by the total. For example, if the deliberate resistance is 500 m\u03a9 and the FET's maximum on resistance is 25 m\u03a9, then the FET is guaranteed to not dissipate more than (25 m\u03a9)/(525 m\u03a9) \\= 4\\.8% if the cap's energy.\n\nA larger series resistance slows the cap discharge time, and shifts more of the total dissipation to the resistor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a capacitor discharge circuit using an N-channel MOSFET.

I created a generic User Control to edit \"people\" objects \\-\\- Populate form fields based on a domain model, and repopulate the domain model based on the form fields.\n\nI also created a view\\-model that encompassed display logic, and then use that to affect the user control.\n\n### Person Domain Model\n\n```\npublic enum PersonType\n{\n    Applicant = 1,\n    Foo = 2\n}\n\npublic class Person\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\n    public string TaxId { get; set; }\n    public IEnumerable<PersonType> Types { get; private set; }\n\n    public bool IsApplicant\n    {\n        get { return Types.Contains(PersonType.Applicant); }\n    }\n\n    public bool IsSomethingElse\n    {\n        get { return Types.Contains(PersonType.Foo); }\n    }\n\n    public bool RequiresTaxId\n    {\n        get { return IsApplicant; }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n### Person View\\-Model\n\n```\npublic class PersonViewModel\n{\n    public Person Person { get; private set; }\n\n    public bool ShowTaxIdField { get { return Person.RequiresTaxId; } }\n\n    public PersonViewModel(Person person)\n    {\n        Person = person;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n### (A Snippet Of) The User Control\n\n```\n<p id=\"TaxIdField\" runat=\"server\">\n    <asp:Label ID=\"TaxIdLabel\" runat=\"server\" AssociatedControlID=\"TaxId\">Tax Id:</asp:Label>\n    <asp:TextBox ID=\"TaxId\" runat=\"server\" />\n</p>\n\n```\n\n### The C\\# Code\\-Behind\n\n```\npublic partial class PersonUserControl : System.Web.UI.UserControl\n{\n    public void SetModel(PersonViewModel model)\n    {\n        TaxId.Text = model.Person.TaxId;\n        TaxIdField.Visible = model.ShowTaxIdField;\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    public PersonViewModel GetModel()\n    {\n        var model = new PersonViewModel(new Person()\n        {\n            TaxId = TaxId.Text.Trim(),\n            // ...\n        });\n\n        return model;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nPush Business Logic Into Your Domain Models\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRemoving duplicated code also means moving business logic into your domain models. Does this \"person\" require a tax Id? Well, the `Person` class should have a property or method called `IsTaxIdRequired`. Watch [Crafting Wicked Domain Models](http://vimeo.com/43598193) for some additional ideas.\n\n### But I Use DataSets...\n\nStop! Immediately. You are intimately tying your C\\# code to the underlying database schema. Even if you have to hand write a mapping layer between DataSet objects and your domain models, you'll still be further ahead because now you can bundle behavior and business rules with your data in one neat, and tidy class. By using DataSets, your Design and Code\\-Behind files implement business logic! Stop this as soon as you can. Even though the WebForms framework doesn't strictly adhere to the Model\\-View\\-Controller pattern, the C\\# Code\\-Behind should be viewed as the \"Controller\" and the Design file should be seen as the \"View\". The only thing left is the \"Model\", *which should not be a DataSet*. DataSet objects give you data, but no behavior leading to repeated business logic.\n\nUse Helper Classes For Initializing the User Interface\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll to often I see this in 15 different UserControls:\n\n```\npublic InitStateDropdownList()\n{\n    ddlState.DataSource = ...\n    ddlState.DataBind();\n    ddlState.Items.Insert(0, new ListItem(\"Select\", string.Empty));\n}\n\n```\n\nPush this into a helper class:\n\n```\npublic static class DropDownListHelper\n{\n    public static void InitStates(DrowDownList list)\n    {\n        list.DataSource = // get options from database or session\n        list.Items.Insert(0, new ListItem(\"Select\", string.Empty));\n        list.DataBind();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd use it:\n\n```\nDropDownListHelper.InitStates(ddlState);\n\n```\n\nSome people rile against \"helper\" classes, but it's surely better than writing what is essentially the same 3 lines of code in multiple places. Even if you can't create super generic User Controls, at least weed out the repetitive code that initializes components upon page load.\n\nWhen is the BIG Rewrite the Answer?\n-----------------------------------\n\nAlmost never. For all my complaints about the WebForms framework, it at *least* compartmentalizes pages and forms, which is a great setup for a long term refactoring job. The key is **adding test coverage**. I've had a lot of success using CodedUI Tests and [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/) for testing WebForms applications, since most if not all business logic is scattered between C\\# and ASP in 19 different files. At least write some tests to validate existing business rules don't get broken during the many refactoring sessions you have in your future."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is refactoring a large ASP.NET WebForms application and wants to improve code organization and reusability.

As far as I understand, (almost) all integers in the real world arise as an approximate description of composite dynamics.\n\nI think anyone here understands why individual macroscopic objects, like rocks, buildings, etc. are approximations that we can count, so I'll dive directly into quantum world.\n\nThe obvious argument about where integers could naturally arise is a quantum harmonic oscillator, which dynamics results in the energy states that we can count with integers:\n$$E\\=(n\\+1/2\\)\\\\hbar\\\\omega$$\nOr the energy states of atoms in the same way.\n\nHowever, there are no free quantum harmonic oscillators in reals life! In real life quantum fields are interacting, and discrete energy states are simply an approximation. To see this clearly consider quantum particle. We can count individual particles, right?\n\nNo! If we take full interacting theory, the particle states polarise the vacuum and, if we start looking closer (at higher energies), we will start seeing that there is no individual particles and what we see from far away as a single particle actually is some kind of a superposition of multiparticles states. (We actually don't really know what \"particles\" are. Abstractly this is captured in the Haag's theorem, stating that the state space of an interacting QFT is not a Fock space.) Moreover such state will never be localized.\n\nLooking at the world from the perspective of interacting QFT allows us to find similar arguments for any system where integers arise. Hence, integers are approximations and not natural.\n\nThe ONLY place, where I see integers as fundamental building blocks are the dimensions of symmetry groups of our world. The integer dimensions of the Lorentz group result in the 4\\-dimensional spacetime, the integer dimensions of the SM groups $SU(3\\)\\\\times SU(2\\)\\\\times U(1\\)$ result in the integer number of different particle types.\n\n**Update 1:**\nA very good point were made about the charge. If we measure the number of elementary charges in a given area, it will always be an integer number, even though the number of particles is not conserved (in QFT). It means, that any physical state is an eigenstate of a charge operator with an integer eigenvalue.\nConsider the simplest case, where the minimal set of mutually commuting operators consist of the Hamiltonian, **H**, and the charge operator, **Q**. Then we can label our states in terms of their eigenvalues $\\|E,q\\\\rangle$. However, are there any requirement, that $q$ is only an integer?\n\n**Update 2:**\nI think, I still need to elaborate on macroscopic objects to stop discussing the distribution of windows \\=)\nConsider, say, rocks, fingers or even particles. You can count them, for example, by counting the number of distinct maxima in their density distribution. This counting is an approximation. First problem is that we need to agree what exactly will count for a single object. Second problem is that these objects are not stable in time: stones will break down and the probability distribution of a particle will become highly delocalized. The next problem is that if you zoom in, you can loose your definition of a single particle: due to vacuum polarizations any electron is surrounded by a cloud of other particles. I'm ok with integers arising from approximate description, they are just not fundamental to the theory.\n\n**Update 3:**\nThe question was temporary closed as being opinion\\-based. So here are two questions that can, in principle, be answered with facts and citations:\n\n1. Following \"Update 2\", are there any mechanisms that relate the fact that the symmetry space, say $U(1\\)$, has integer dimensions and the fact that all the physical state are eigenvalues of the generator of $U(1\\)$ with integer eigenvalues? Simply put, why the charged is quantized and quantized evenly?\n2. Is there a way, to construct a symmetry group, such that it doesn't have an integer number of dimensions? Such that the number of generators is not an integer number (whatever that means \\=))\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are plenty of exact integers in physics.\n\nTake a wavefunction, for example: $\\\\psi(x) \\= \\\\langle x \\| \\\\psi \\\\rangle$. You can count the stationary points and the zero crossings. 1,2,3, ....\n\nIn the room where I am sitting, there are exactly 2 windows.

This pattern, known as the curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP), allows for the creation of static factory methods that can return the most specific type possible without requiring explicit casting.\n\nIn the Piranha CMS codebase, this is evident in the `GenericPage<T>` class, which contains a static `Create` method:\n\n```csharp\npublic static T Create(IApi api, string typeId = null)\n{\n    return api.Pages.Create<T>(typeId);\n}\n```\n\nThis method can return an instance of the most derived type T, which is guaranteed to be a subclass of BasePage<T> due to the constraint. This allows for type-safe and convenient object creation without the need for downcasting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the base class (Page<T>) and the derived class (BasePage<T>) are not the same type. Option B, while potentially a benefit of this pattern, is not the primary purpose in this context.

For completeness I write down a complete proof.\n\nForm a Cantor set as follows: let $I\\_0 \\= \\[0,1/3]$, $I\\_1\\=\\[2/3,1]$. If $I\\_{i\\_1,\\\\ldots, i\\_n}$ has been defined, let $I\\_{i\\_1,\\\\ldots,i\\_n,0}, I\\_{i\\_1,\\\\ldots,i\\_n,1}$ be the two intervals obtained by removing from $I\\_{i\\_1,\\\\ldots, i\\_n}$ a central open interval of length $1/(n\\+2\\)$ times the length of $I\\_{i\\_1,\\\\ldots, i\\_n}$. The Cantor set $C$ is then\n$$\nC :\\= \\\\bigcap\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty C\\_n :\\=\\\\bigcap\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\bigcup\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_n} I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_n}.\n$$\n(This is just like the construction of the usual Cantor set, except that the relative lengths of the removed intervals tend to $0$ rather than staying constant).\n\nWe define a continuous function $f:C\\\\to \\[0,1]$, and then extend $f$ to all of $\\[0,1]$ in an arbitrary way.\n\nLet $x$ be a point of $C$. Then $x$ is coded by a unique sequence $i\\_1 i\\_2\\\\ldots\\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}^{\\\\mathbb{N}}$, and we define\n$$\nf(x) \\= \\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty i\\_{n^2} 2^{\\-n}.\n$$\nIt is very easy to check that $f$ is indeed continuous.\n\nNow let $t\\=\\[0,1]$, and let $t \\=\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty a\\_n 2^{\\-n}$ be a binary expansion of $t$. Then $f^{\\-1}(t)$ consists of those points in $C$ whose code $i\\_1 i\\_2\\\\ldots$ satisfies $i\\_{n^2} \\=a\\_n$. In other words, except for places corresponding to perfect squares, the other elements of the sequence are completely arbitrary. \n\nIt is a fairly easy exercise in the calculation of Hausdorff dimension to show that $f^{\\-1}(t)$ has dimension $1$. The easiest way to give a formal proof is perhaps to use the mass distribution principle (see e.g. Falconer's or Mattila's books): we define a measure $\\\\mu$ on $f^{\\-1}(t)$ inductively as follows. We start by assigning a unit mass to $\\[0,1]$. After $k$ steps, we have assigned a mass to all intervals $I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k}$, which is $0$ whenever $I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k}\\\\cap f^{\\-1}(t)\\=\\\\varnothing$. Now, if $k\\+1\\=n^2$ for some $n$, then we specify that $\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k a\\_n}) \\= \\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k})$ and $\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k (1\\-a\\_n)})\\=0$. Otherwise, if $k\\+1$ is not a perfect square, then we specify that\n$$\n\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k 0})\\=\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k 1}) \\= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k}).\n$$\n(In other words, at the stages where the next symbol isn't determined, split mass uniformly; otherwise, pass all the mass to the required interval of next level.)\n\nIn this way we have assigned a mass to each of the intervals in the construction of $C$, so that $\\\\mu$ is a well defined measure, which is supported on $f^{\\-1}(t)$ by construction. Note that if $n^2\\\\le k \\< (n\\+1\\)^2$, then $\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k})\\=2^{k\\-n}$. Hence\n$$\n\\\\lim\\_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mu(I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k})}{\\-\\\\log(2^k)} \\= 1,\n$$\nfor any sequence $i\\_1 i\\_2\\\\ldots$, and since\n$$\n\\\\lim\\_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log\\|I\\_{i\\_1\\\\ldots i\\_k}\\|}{\\-\\\\log(2^k)} \\= 1,\n$$\nit is easy to deduce that\n$$\n\\\\lim\\_{r\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\log(\\\\mu(B(x,r))}{\\\\log r} \\= 1\n$$\nfor $\\\\mu$\\-almost every $x$ (indeed for all $x$ in the support of $\\\\mu$). Since $\\\\mu(f^{\\-1}(t))\\=1$, the mass distribution principle implies that $\\\\dim\\_H(f^{\\-1}(t))\\\\ge 1$ (and hence it is exactly $1$).\n\nTwo concluding remarks. A straightforward modification of the argument shows that for any gauge function $\\\\varphi(x)$ such that $\\\\lim\\_{x\\\\to 0} \\\\varphi(x)/x\\=\\+\\\\infty$, there is a continuous function $f:\\[0,1]\\\\to \\[0,1]$ such that every fiber $f^{\\-1}(t)$ has positive $\\\\varphi$\\-dimensional Hausdorff measure.\n\nFinally, these results are not really surprising, since continuity alone does not imply any Hausdorff dimension bounds. This is the same reason why space\\-filling curves exist \\- continuity does not prevent the dimension of the image from being as large as the ambient space, and likewise it does not prevent the dimension of the fibers from being as large as the ambient space."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a continuous function f:[0,1] \u2192 [0,1].

You can convince yourself of this by simulating several datasets with the sample sizes and proportions that you have, then computing the test statistic for the normal approximation (simulate under the null of equal proportions), then plot a histogram of all these simulated test statistics. If this histogram is approximately normal then a normal approximation is fine.\n\nYou could also use Fisher's exact test (probably use sampling to get the estimated p\\-value, your sample size will require quite a bit of time to compute the exact p\\-value from this test)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing two Bernoulli distributions with highly skewed data, where 96-99% of samples are in the \"false\" category.

Despite the extreme skewness, the large sample size (500+ \"trues\" and tens of thousands of \"falses\") satisfies the common rule of thumb that there should be at least 10 samples in each category for each group. This makes the normal approximation reasonable and robust. \n\nOption A is incorrect because non-parametric tests are not necessary when the underlying distribution (Bernoulli) is known.
