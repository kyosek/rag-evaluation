I was considering going a thermal store with a biomass boiler (wood pellet) and solar thermal, to supply:\n\n* domestic hot water\n* high temperature water for radiators\n* low temperature water for underfloor heating\n\nWhile researching these options I've discovered that underfloor heating needs carefully controlled water temperature. Installation guides for floor coverings make explicit requirements about how the materials are commissioned with respect to the underfloor heating.\n\nSo I assume that the underfloor heating system, when used in conjunction with a thermal store has some method of modifying the available water, mixing hot with cooler if hot is too hot? If this assumption is correct what part of the system manages this and where does the mixing occur?\n\n---\n\n*Update*\n\nYes, this is supposedly possible with a thermal store. Quoting from a manufacturers' website:\n\n> The Thermal Store can be used to capture energy from a variety of heat sources, such as solar, heat pumps, biomass and CHP, and is capable of providing hot water at varying temperatures to suit different heat emitters within a building. For example the Thermal Store can supply an underfloor heating system that may require 40\u00b0C, radiators requiring 70\u00b0C and hot water at 55\u00b0C, all from the same unit.\n\nYes, qualified engineers would be involved in the commissioning of such a system. However, there's an amount DIY in designing the system in the first place and I may take on some of the installation work myself (e.g. laying the pipework for the underfloor heating).\n\nI'm seeking understanding in how such a system balances the temperature requirements.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Thank you all for your input.\n\nAfter a third night of searching, I've found an answer [on this website](http://www.bordersunderfloor.co.uk/schematic_gshp2mansol.htm) that satisfies my curiosity and it turns out that the answer is quite simple: *The hot draw from the thermal store is mixed with the cold return from the underfloor heating as necessary.*\n\n> The temperature of the water entering the UFH zone is regulated by a thermostatic mixing valve. Water returning from the UFH zone is directed back into either the thermal store or the heat pump depending on the function of the heat pump and the position of the return diverter valve.\n\nThe schematic isn't an exact match for my envisioned scheme (I don't have the space for a ground\\-source heat pump and I'm not convinced by the efficacy of air\\-source), but it explains the details I was missing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a central heating system using a thermal store with multiple heat sources and different temperature requirements, how is the water temperature regulated for underfloor heating?\n\nA) The thermal store automatically separates water into different temperature zones\nB) A dedicated heat pump is used exclusively for the underfloor heating circuit\nC) A thermostatic mixing valve blends hot water from the store with cooler return water\nD) The biomass boiler adjusts its output temperature based on the underfloor heating demand\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a thermostatic mixing valve is used to regulate the temperature of water entering the underfloor heating (UFH) zone. This valve mixes the hot water from the thermal store with the cooler return water from the UFH circuit to achieve the desired temperature, typically around 40\u00b0C for underfloor heating systems. This method allows for precise temperature control, which is crucial for underfloor heating performance and to meet the requirements of various floor coverings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because thermal stores don't automatically separate water into different temperature zones; they store hot water that is then mixed as needed.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the system described doesn't use a dedicated heat pump for underfloor heating. The thermal store can supply water at different temperatures for various purposes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the biomass boiler doesn't directly adjust its output for underfloor heating; instead, the mixing valve manages the temperature regulation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/12", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/440406", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/211459/"], "docs_id": 440406, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So the path of an object in configuration space is given by Hamilton's principle, which states that the path which the particle travels on is the one on which the action is stationary:\n$$\\\\delta S \\= \\\\delta \\\\int L dt \\= 0\\.$$\n\nI was thinking though, is it possible for the stationary point of the Action to not exist?

Sox is used to convert from MP3 to FLAC, which is a straightforward operation. For the FLAC to MP3 conversion, it uses a combination of the flac tool to decode the FLAC file to a WAV stream, which is then piped to lame for MP3 encoding.

(Yeah, never mind the English meaning of that, it\u2019s not pronounced the same.) The etymology of the word is actually that it\u2019s a shortened form of the word *alts\u00e5* (which means something like \"therefore\", \"thus\", or *\"verily\"*, the latter sense being where the slang meaning derives from.)\n\nExample:\n\n```\nJeg liker det  ikke, ass.\nI   like  that not   ????\n\n```\n\nWhich means, \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d The purpose of the word *ass* is hard to explain, but it sort of adds some sincerity to the sentence. Without it, the sentence sounds kind of naked. A bit like English *indeed*, but *indeed* doesn\u2019t work for a negative statement like this, and it certainly doesn\u2019t work for informal language.\n\nThe word is extremely common in spoken Norwegian, especially among young people.\n\nSome more examples:\n\n> Jeg vet ikke, *ass*. (I don\u2019t know.)\n> \n> \n> Jeg vet det, *ass*. (I know.)\n> \n> \n> Du m\u00e5 pr\u00f8ve det, *ass*. (You have to try it.)\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019m using *man* a lot, as in \u201cYou have to try it, *man*.\u201d but I think some variation would be good. I realize that I could just use nothing, since the word carries only **some** meaning and is not that crucial, but I still feel it would be better to use **something**, to capture the feeling of the sentence.\n\nSo I know about *man* or even the word *dude*. I realize that you could use these words even when talking to a girl, but it doesn\u2019t seem that perfect. And are these words natural when the speaker herself is a girl? Also, how about when talking to a group of people?\n\nThe word must be something a 17\\-year old might say to his or her buddy while hanging out. It doesn\u2019t *have* to be slang, but it does have to sound natural in a subtitle where young people are talking informally to each other.\n\nDetails regarding Norwegian *ass*\n=================================\n\nIt\u2019s an enhancer, but not a very strong one. It\u2019s more like a laid\\-back word like *dude*. You\u2019re not **that** passionate about what you\u2019re saying, but you do mean in. *Ass* at the end means that you mean what you\u2019re saying. A bit like *really*. But it\u2019s also a laidback word, you can certainly say it while speaking in a lazy or careless tone. Also, it\u2019s used *very* frequently in informal Norwegian, so it\u2019s a bit watered down. The word it derives from, *alts\u00e5* (thus, therefore, verily), **could** be used in the same way, but hardly any young people do so in informal contexts, and it sounds old\\-fashioned.\n\nI found the [definition of *alts\u00e5*](http://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=alts%C3%A5&ant_bokmaal=5&ant_nynorsk=5&begge=%20&ordbok=begge) in a Norwegian dictionary:\n\n> ### Forsterkende:\n> \n> \n> * Det er helt sant, alts\u00e5!\n> * Han er veldig kjekk, alts\u00e5!\n\nWhich means:\n\n> ### Reinforcing:\n> \n> \n> * It\u2019s completely true, verily!\n> * He is very handsome, verily!\n\nI guess I should just use *verily* in the subtitles. That sounds, like, *so* casual, for real.\n\nPlease note that *alts\u00e5* is perhaps not *as* old\\-fashioned in Norwegian as *verily* is in English. (I believe *verily* is **extremely** old\\-fashioned and perhaps even pompous in English?) However, *alts\u00e5* **is** still somewhat old\\-fashioned.\n\nTo break down the word *alts\u00e5* even more, its etymology is *alt* (all, everything) \\+ *s\u00e5* (so).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **When subtitling, this word is God's gift to you!**\n\nHere's your predicament as I see it: you are bound to render speech, presumably casual dialogue, in subtitles. A word that seems to be a cross between an epistemic intensifier and a filler keeps being repeated. It has no obvious counterpart in the target language, but a lot of good renderings exist. The main point appears to be to sound colloquial.\n\nMy advice: **Do not try to translate the word**, especially not by making a list of possible English renderings and alternating between them. **Just translate the meaning.** If the meaning and style (and *not* the original wording in Norwegian) call for \"man\" or \"you see\", etc., then by all means put it in (even if the source phrase does not contain \"ass\"). \n\nI'm sure you are already doing that, but \"ass\" keeps bothering you. \nIt would be a serious problem in dubbing (as your audience would be lip\\-reading). With subtitles, you want to be **minimalistic**; you may need to put less than the original while being truthful to it. So personally I'd be very happy and try to put all the colloquial, buddy\\-buddy feel of the conversation into the wording of the phrase itself.\n\nSo \n\n> \"Jeg vet ikke, ass.\"  \n> \n> *No idea.*  \n> \n>  or (if you must)  \n> \n> *Really, no idea.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: When subtitling a Norwegian TV show that frequently uses the colloquial term \"ass\" at the end of sentences, what is the most appropriate approach?\n\nA) Always translate \"ass\" as \"man\" or \"dude\" to maintain consistency\nB) Create a list of English equivalents like \"really\", \"you see\", \"indeed\" and alternate between them\nC) Translate the meaning and style of the entire phrase, omitting a direct translation of \"ass\" if unnecessary\nD) Consistently use \"verily\" as it's the closest etymological equivalent to the original Norwegian word\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to translate the meaning and style of the entire phrase, rather than trying to find a direct equivalent for \"ass\" in every instance. This allows for more natural and context-appropriate subtitles. The passage advises against trying to translate the word directly or creating a list of alternatives to cycle through. Instead, it recommends focusing on conveying the colloquial feel of the conversation through the overall wording of the phrase. This approach allows for minimalism in subtitling while remaining true to the original meaning and tone. Options A, B, and D all represent less effective strategies that could lead to awkward or unnatural-sounding translations."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/22", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/197854", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/70524/"], "docs_id": 197854, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I start a process and then delete the binary of it, I can still recover it from `/proc/<pid>/exe`:\n\n```\n$ cp `which sleep` .\n$ ./sleep 10m &\n[1] 13728\n$ rm sleep\n$ readlink /proc/13728/exe                           \n/tmp/sleep (deleted)\n$ cp /proc/13728/exe ./sleep-copy\n$ diff sleep-copy `which sleep` && echo not different\nnot different\n$ stat /proc/13728/exe \n  File: \u2018/proc/13728/exe\u2019 -> \u2018/tmp/sleep (deleted)\u2019\n  Size: 0           Blocks: 0          IO Block: 1024   symbolic link\n\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if I make a symbolic link myself, delete the target and attempt to copy:\n\n```\ncp: cannot stat \u2018sleep\u2019: No such file or directory\n\n```\n\n`/proc` is an interface to the kernel.

Technically this might count as a violation of POSIX, but `/proc` is a special filesystem after all.\n\n`/proc/<pid>/exe` appears to be a symlink when you `stat` it. This is a convenient way for the kernel to export the pathname it knows for the process' executable.

Instead the kernel just gives you access to the open file entry directly.\n\nNotice that when you `ls -l` a `/proc/<pid>/exe` pseudofile for a process whose executable has been deleted the symlink target has the string \" (deleted)\" at the end of it.

This seems to have worked fairly well. Imported as a layer into QGIS, it overlays the Google imagery from the Open Layers plugin well enough for my current use.\n\nSince I have a little more drawing control, I've been trying to use AutoCAD map for creating the features (call this the \u201cmaster.dwg\u201d). I imported the TIFF file and drew a few features based on the TIFF image. Exported them to shapefiles, opened in QGIS and this looked pretty good as well (with the previous TIFF and OpenLayers shown).\n\nMy next step was to create a layout of one of the sections in AutoCAD map. I created a drawing using architectural units so I could enter values as 25\u2019 6\u201d, etc. Once I completed the layout, I tried inserting the section into the master.dwg. For some reason, the scales seem to be massively out of whack. Basically, the inserted section is probably hundreds of times larger than the georeferenced TIFF. The large dimension of the section is only about 200 feet, yet when zoomed to extents, the TIFF file doesn't even appear. It is necessary to zoom in quite a bit before it even appears as point in the drawing.\n\nUsing the measure tool in AutoCAD, measuring the distance between two known points on the TIFF literally registers a Zero (I would have expected it to be about 200 ft). In QGIS, it measures about as expected.\n\nAny thoughts as to what is happening here? I'm at a loss right now.\n\n\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\n\nI've made a little progress. Today, I was able to get some shapefiles from our local GIS dept. of the area around the cemetery. I've tried MAPCONNECT and MAPIMPORT with the same results... I create a new drawing, assign the projection (MI83\\-SIF) and then attach / import the shapefiles. Units for the drawing are standard decimal. Using the MEASUREGEOM, I measure between two points and get 204 (which is what I would expect in feet). When I change the units to Architectural, then MEASUREGEOM returns just over 17'. So, it appears that, while \"204\" in the shapefile should be feet, AutoCAD Map is interpreting it as inches.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After drawing with arch units you can switch back to engineering.  \n\nThen you need to assign the coord sys in map.  \n\nAfter which upon insert of your tiff be sure to use the Map image insert (not the normal insert pulldown) and double check that the units is not inches"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS novice is working on mapping a local cemetery using AutoCAD Map and QGIS. They've created a georeferenced TIFF and drawn features in AutoCAD Map, but when inserting a section layout into the master drawing, the scales are severely mismatched. What series of steps should they take to resolve this issue?\n\nA) Change the drawing units to metric, reassign the coordinate system, and use the standard Insert command for the TIFF file\nB) Keep the architectural units, use Map Image Insert for the TIFF, and ensure units are set to feet instead of inches\nC) Switch from architectural to engineering units, assign the coordinate system in Map, use Map Image Insert for the TIFF, and verify units are not set to inches\nD) Export all AutoCAD drawings to shapefiles, import them into QGIS, and abandon the use of AutoCAD Map altogether\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach involves several key steps:\n1. Switching from architectural to engineering units allows for more accurate measurements in a GIS context.\n2. Assigning the correct coordinate system in Map ensures proper spatial reference.\n3. Using the Map Image Insert command (not the standard Insert) is crucial for maintaining georeference.\n4. Verifying that the units are not set to inches prevents the scale mismatch described in the problem.\n\nThis solution addresses the scale issues while maintaining the workflow between AutoCAD Map and QGIS, which is important for the user's project goals."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/03/25", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/58762", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/22404/"], "docs_id": 58762, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I believe it is Xerath's Arcanopulse(`Q`), even without the Locus of Power(`W`) buff.

The symptoms described in the question suggest a corrupted TCP stack, which can often be resolved by resetting the TCP/IP stack. The recommended steps are:\n\n1. Open an elevated command prompt\n2. Run \"netsh int ip reset reset.txt\"\n3. Run \"netsh winsock reset\"\n4.

Needing to quote arguments only comes into play when you're dealing with a shell, and if `find` is calling `rsync` directly, there is no shell involved. Using visual output isn't a good way to tell if it works or not because you can't see where each argument begins and ends.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n```\n# touch \"foo'\\\"bar\"\n\n# ls\nfoo'\"bar\n\n# find . -type f -exec stat {} \\;\n  File: \u2018./foo'\"bar\u2019\n  Size: 0           Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: fd00h/64768d    Inode: 1659137     Links: 1\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1004/ phemmer)   Gid: ( 1004/ phemmer)\nAccess: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\nModify: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\nChange: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\n Birth: -\n\n```\n\nNotice that I didn't quote the `{}` in the arg to `stat`.\n\nNow that said, your command is going to be very non\\-performant, because you're calling `rsync` for every single matching file. There are 2 ways you can solve this.\n\nAs others have indicated you can use pipe the file list to `rsync` on stdin:\n\n```\n# find . -type f -print0 | rsync --files-from=- -0 . dest/\n\n# ls dest/\nfoo'\"bar\n\n```\n\nThis will use null bytes as the file name delimiter since files can't contain null bytes in their name.\n\nIf you're using GNU `find`, you have another method of invoking `-exec`, and that's `-exec {} +`. In this style `find` will pass more than one argument at a time. However all the arguments are added to the end of the command, not in the middle. You can address this by passing the arguments through a small shell:\n\n```\n# find . -type f -exec sh -c 'rsync \"$@\" dest/' {} +\n\n# ls dest/\nfoo'\"bar\n\n```\n\nThis will pass the list of file to the `sh` which will then substitute them in for the `\"$@\"`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the find command to locate files and directories for use with rsync, which of the following statements is true regarding the handling of special characters in filenames?\n\nA) You must always manually escape special characters in filenames when passing them from find to rsync.\n\nB) Using double quotes around {} in the find command's -exec option will properly handle all special characters.\n\nC) There's no need to escape or quote filenames when find directly executes rsync, as no shell is involved in the process.\n\nD) The -print0 option of find must always be used with rsync to handle special characters correctly.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, when find directly executes rsync using the -exec option, there is no shell involved in the process. This means that special characters in filenames are passed directly to rsync without the need for escaping or quoting. The quoting problem often arises when users try to solve a problem that doesn't exist in this context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manual escaping is unnecessary when find directly executes rsync.\nOption B is incorrect because using double quotes around {} is not only unnecessary but can actually cause problems with filenames containing double quotes.\nOption D is incorrect because while -print0 can be useful when piping to rsync, it's not always necessary, especially when using find's -exec option to run rsync directly."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/06", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78265", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/50049/"], "docs_id": 78265, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm seeing several moderator flags every day that express concern over the technical merit of an answer.

Therefore, the correct output is 30 mA for 80 ms.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the current.\nOption C is incorrect because it misstates the pulse duration.\nOption D is incorrect because it gives the power output instead of the current.\n\nThis question tests understanding of power, voltage, and current relationships in the context of piezoelectric energy harvesting, as well as the ability to interpret technical specifications from datasheets."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/08", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18073", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3773/"], "docs_id": 18073, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Apologies for the almost text\\-book like question. \n\nI have a 2x2 design with fixed categories and a continuous response variable.\n\nIf the variances are equal between groups (Bartlett test) and residuals are normally distributed (Shapiro test), ok I can do standard ANOVA. \n\nOtherwise: \n\n1.
