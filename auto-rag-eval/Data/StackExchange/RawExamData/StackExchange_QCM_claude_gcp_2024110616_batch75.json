One is on back side, one is on side (grey mesh, highlighted by yellow arrow) and a small round hole in center (highlighted by pink).\n> \n> \n> [![Enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4JjU.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4JjU.png)\n> \n> \n> I don't even know which of them is speaker and how to properly insert it in my ears. So I want to know which one is actually speaker so I can understand how to use it properly.\n> \n> \n> I had always assumed that the grey mesh (yellow) is the speaker. But now I feel suspicious because in my 2 years of usage, I suddenly realized that I can hear more sound from pink highlighted hole as compared to grey mesh (yellow).\n\nI searched about it, but I couldn't find anything useful.\n\nIs there a site where I can ask about it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As much as it's Stack Exchanges aim to the the repository for answering every question possible, there's questions that are better asked elsewhere.\n\nFor product specific questions like this, I'd highly recommend asking the product manufacturer directly. JBL is a well\\-established brand with a good support site.\n\nI'd ask them directly.\n\n<https://support.jbl.com/gb/en/>"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech-savvy user is seeking advice about their JBL earphones on an online forum. They've noticed multiple openings on the earphones and are unsure about their proper use. As a community moderator, what is the most appropriate response to guide this user towards a resolution?\n\nA) Provide a detailed explanation of typical earphone anatomy based on general knowledge\nB) Suggest the user conduct extensive online research to find similar earphone models\nC) Recommend contacting JBL's official support for product-specific information\nD) Advise the user to experiment with different insertion methods and report back\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the ability to analyze a real-world scenario and apply critical thinking to determine the most appropriate course of action. The correct answer, C, is based on the top answer in the documentation, which emphasizes that product-specific questions are best directed to the manufacturer. This approach ensures the user receives accurate, authoritative information directly from JBL.\n\nOption A is a distractor that might seem helpful but could lead to misinformation, as earphone designs can vary significantly between brands and models. Option B represents a common but potentially inefficient approach that might not yield accurate results. Option D is a risky suggestion that could potentially damage the earphones or the user's hearing.\n\nThe question requires integration of multiple concepts, including understanding the limitations of community-based support, recognizing the importance of manufacturer-specific information, and applying best practices in user support. It also touches on the broader concept of appropriate use of different online resources for specific types of queries."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/24", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/36580", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/51/"], "docs_id": 36580, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: By high school mathematics I mean Elementary Function Arithmetic (EFA), where one is allowed \\+, \u00d7, xy, and a weak form of induction for formulas with bounded quantifiers. This is much weaker than primitive recursive arithmetic, which is in turn much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which is in turn much weaker than ZFC that we normally work in.\n\nHowever there seem to be very few theorems (about integers) that are known to require anything more than this incredibly weak system to prove them. The few theorems that I know need more than this include:\n\n* Consistency results for various stronger systems (following G\u00f6del). This includes results such as the Paris Harrington theorem and Goodstein sequences that are cleverly disguised forms of consistency results.\n* Some results in Ramsey theory, saying that anything possible will happen in a sufficiently large set. Typical examples: Gowers proved a very large lower bound for Szemer\u00e9di's lemma showing that it cannot be proved in elementary function arithmetic, and the Robertson\\-Seymour graph minor theorem is known to require such large functions that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic.\n\nI can think of no results at all (about integers) outside these areas (mathematical logic, variations of Ramsey theory) that are known to require anything more than EFA to prove.\n\nA good rule of thumb is that anything involving unbounded towers of exponentials is probably not provable in EFA, and conversely if there is no function this large then one might suspect the result is provable in EFA.\n\nSo my question is: does anyone know of natural results in \"ordinary\" mathematics (number theory, algebraic geometry, Lie groups, operator algebras, differential geometry, combinatorics, etc...) in which functions larger than a finite tower of exponentials occur in a serious way? In practice this is probably more or less equivalent to asking for theorems about integers unprovable in EFA.\n\nRelated links:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_conjecture> about Friedman asking a similar question.\n\nBy the way, encoding deep results as Diophantine equations and so on is cheating. And please do not make remarks suggesting that Fermat's last theorem needs inaccessible cardinals unless you understand Wiles's proof.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement that the periodicity of [Laver tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_table) tends to infinity is not provable in PRA (hence also EFA), although it is provable under the assumption of a [rank\\-into\\-rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank-into-rank) embedding."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is researching the limitations of various mathematical systems and their ability to prove certain theorems. They come across a result in combinatorics that involves a function growing faster than any finite tower of exponentials. Which of the following conclusions is most likely correct regarding the provability of this result?\n\nA) The result is likely provable in Elementary Function Arithmetic (EFA) but not in Peano Arithmetic\nB) The result is probably unprovable in EFA but may be provable in Primitive Recursive Arithmetic\nC) The result is certainly provable in ZFC but likely unprovable in Peano Arithmetic\nD) The result is likely provable in Peano Arithmetic as it's from \"ordinary\" mathematics\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires integrating multiple concepts from the given documentation and applies them to a hypothetical scenario, targeting higher-level thinking. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"anything involving unbounded towers of exponentials is probably not provable in EFA.\" Since the question mentions a function growing faster than any finite tower of exponentials, this strongly suggests it's unprovable in EFA.\n\n2. The text indicates that EFA is much weaker than Primitive Recursive Arithmetic (PRA), which is in turn weaker than Peano Arithmetic. This hierarchy suggests that while the result may be unprovable in EFA, it could potentially be provable in PRA.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because if it's not provable in EFA, it can't be provable in the weaker system of Peano Arithmetic.\n\n4. Option C is plausible but less likely, as the documentation suggests that very few \"ordinary\" mathematical results require systems stronger than EFA, let alone systems stronger than Peano Arithmetic.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect because the growth rate of the function suggests it's beyond what's typically provable in EFA, and the documentation implies that most \"ordinary\" mathematics doesn't require systems stronger than EFA.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the hierarchies of mathematical systems, their proving capabilities, and the relationship between function growth rates and provability, requiring analysis and application of the provided information."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/18", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352339", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/196044/"], "docs_id": 352339, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Thanks for checking this one out.\n\n```\njonathan@melange:~$ top\n\ntop - 05:21:08 up 44 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.21, 1.68, 1.98\nTasks: 351 total,   2 running, 349 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n%Cpu(s):  4.3 us, 14.0 sy,  2.1 ni, 70.4 id,  8.9 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.3 si,  0.0 st\nGiB Mem :   15.579 total,    0.173 free,    4.141 used,   11.264 buff/cache\nGiB Swap:   15.910 total,   15.868 free,    0.042 used.   11.014 avail Mem \n\n  PID  PPID   UID USER     RUSER    TTY          TIME+  %CPU %MEM S COMMAND                                                                                                                                   \n   67     2     0 root     root     ?         22:22.40 100.0  0.0 R kworker/0:1 \n\n```\n\nThe setup \\- ubuntu 16\\.10\\. 4\\.8\\.0\\-41\\-generic.

So I had tried disabling/uninstalling long running processes such as dropbox, insync (google drive), crashplan, keybase, Variety background, multiload indicator, psensor, guake. (I feel like I have a pretty slick setup most of the time...) but nothing seemed to help.\n\nThere had been other questions lurking around suggesting malfunctioning wifi, nvidia drivers or usb drivers. But nothing in my logs were suggesting this either. Somewhat thankful as almost always the solution in those was simply find newer nvidia drivers, update the kernel, or \"Deal with it.\" My laptop is pretty up to date already, I have no enterprise reason to stay on 16\\.04 and I already have the nvidia ppa activated, as with the intel drivers, so this wasn't much help. \n\nPerhaps the kworker was actually the result of the laptop overheating \\-\\> cpu throttling \\+ cpu fan management. Not the cause. As suggested by [Stop cpu from overheating](https://askubuntu.com/questions/391474/stop-cpu-from-overheating/875872) So I've just used some compressed air to clean out the fans (didn't think this would be a problem on a laptop only 9 months old yet there was actually a bit of dust) and investigating the thermal\\-conf.xml which suggests that the fan kicks in at 55\u00b0C (although still working on what I can do here) \n\nThinking this may actually be the solution. Will report back soon.\n\nUpdate 2\n========\n\nSo doing the Acer bios update totally ruined everything related to my secureboot setup and corrupted the the efi files so it took me a few days to work out how to regenerate the ubuntu efi keys and the and windows efi keys. \n\nI tried cleaning out the dust, and it definitely helped for the two days until I started with the bios issues. \n\nBut the kworker is back (and yes it is the same as far as I can tell). I also have some more information now. I can see that the cpu is not throttling down, but rather staying at the maximum. The fan is running, but the device is only sitting around the 60degree mark, so i wouldn't call this serious over heating.\n\nThe commands from the other thread require raising to the root user, not just using sudo. so sudo su and then getting the stack trace gives the following. \n\n```\n[<ffffffff98a9dcea>] worker_thread+0xca/0x500\n[<ffffffff98aa40d8>] kthread+0xd8/0xf0\n[<ffffffff992a071f>] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x40\n[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff\n\n```\n\nDoesn't look particularly helpful to me.\n\nLong time later....\n-------------------\n\nI see this answer is still getting lots of views so I thought I'd add in what I remember of what else happened. I run an Aspire V 15 Nitro 592G laptop with Nvidia gpu. The wifi is flaky, the mic doesn't work, Nvidia drivers cause the gnome shell and monitors to repeatedly crash and more. This isn't the best ubuntu machine even though it's pretty powerful when it is working. To be honest, I now run Ubuntu 17\\.10, and I still have major issues making this machine work.\n\nI wrote that cleaning the fan seemed to help in the comments. It certainly made things quieter. But I suspect it was actually a combination of the following:\n\n* Tracker (the full text search daemon) \\-\\> crazy resource hog\n* The wifi drivers at the time were just awful\n* Variety (wallpaper switcher) \\+ dual monitor \\+ nvidia \\+ gnome shell \\-\\> unreliable monitor setup and massive ram leak on gnome shell,\n* the multiload shell extension also a memory leak\n\nI realise this doesn't help new users with different problems. Perhaps one day things will be easier to diagnose, until then; good luck!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question seems abandoned as it wasn't updated anymore, but I'll give it a try anyway:\nI have seen quite some where excessive interrupts occurred, slowing the machine down.

While several potential causes are mentioned, the most likely root cause based on the information provided is an overheating CPU leading to thermal throttling. This conclusion is supported by several key points:\n\n1. The user mentions investigating \"over heating messages\" as a reason for posting the question.\n2. They specifically state, \"Perhaps the kworker was actually the result of the laptop overheating -> cpu throttling + cpu fan management. Not the cause.\"\n3. The user reports cleaning dust from the fans of their 9-month-old laptop, which provided temporary improvement.\n4. In a later update, they mention the CPU not throttling down and staying at maximum, with the device \"sitting around the 60-degree mark.\"\n\nWhile other options like Wi-Fi driver issues (A), GNOME shell memory leaks (C), and BIOS/UEFI problems (D) are mentioned in the documentation, they are either presented as less likely causes or separate issues.

For example, let's say I put a weight onto a piston at equilibrium. The force of gravity will now act on the system. Why is the force (gravity I think) of a piston slowly compressing an ideal gas not conservative? The \"potential energy\" of the weight should be being transferred into the gas molecules somehow because the internal energy (I think) of the system went up because we see that the pressure of the gas has gone up.\n\nDoes it matter if the process is reversible or irreversible?\n\nNote: Some of the potential energy also turned into kinetic energy of the weight as it moved. But perhaps we can assume that the weight moves so slowly that it gains an infinitesimal in kinetic energy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It does matter if the process is reversible or irreversible because reversible processes give maximum work. It can be verified by a PV diagram of a reversible process. These processes produce maximum work because the value of pressure is infinitesimally greater (in case of compression) than the pressure of the gas in the container. \n\nAs we know, $W\\_{ext}\\=\\-P\\_{ext}\\\\Delta V$, if Pressure was maximum for each infinitesimal change in volume then the work done (corresponding to that change) will also be maximum. This can only happen if the external pressure is infinitesimally greater than the pressure of the gas in the container and compression will take place very slowly.\n\nIn other words, the PV diagrams of reversible processes give maximum area under the PV curve and the volume axis.\n\nThese processes, ideally speaking, never reach completion and are very slow and obviously, cannot be realized in real life. A reversible process is a ideal process.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SephW.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SephW.jpg)\n\nWork done in path dependent. This can also be verified by the PV diagram. Take this diagram for example.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CP8I.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CP8I.png)\n\nThere are infinitely many paths that can be taken to move the system from state A to state B and each path will give a different value of work done.\n\nThe work done in path A\\-B is greater than the work done in path A\\-C\\-B. (Work done is give by the area under the PV curve and V axis).\n\nThe work done by the system in a cyclic transformation is equal to the heat absorbed by the system. Since $\\\\Delta U\\=0$, if the system work is done **by** the system $(\\\\Delta V\\=\\+ve)$ then the heat has to be absorbed by the system $(q\\=\\+ve)$ in order for $\\\\Delta U$ to be $0$. And if work is done on the system then the energy will be released from the system."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a thermodynamic cycle for a novel heat engine.

The correct answer is D because reversible processes give maximum work output in a thermodynamic cycle. \n\nThe key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Reversible processes produce maximum work because the external pressure is infinitesimally greater (for compression) or less (for expansion) than the gas pressure at each step.\n\n2. In a PV diagram, reversible processes give the maximum area under the curve, which represents the work done.\n\n3. Reversible processes are ideal and occur very slowly, allowing the system to remain in near-equilibrium throughout.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adiabatic processes alone don't guarantee maximum work output.

For the SE one needs information about the sample size. Is it the fact that the sample size is non\\-existent when doing say, purposive or quota sampling, what impedes us from generating sampling errors of the estimate to later calculate confidence intervals? \n\nI then thought, well, regardless of the sampling method use (probability based or not), you'll end up with a certain sample size. Can this not be used to then calculate SE of the estimate, and ultimately confidence intervals. Or perhaps, it all comes down to my final suspicion: one can certainly calculate SE for an estimate and then proceed to generate the CIs, but these will ultimately be wrong given the poor consideration of the sampling design.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have a different take on this. A confidence interval confronts the sample with a certain probability model. It basically gives a set of parameters, under the model, that are consistent with the sample. Obviously the model is wrong in various respects (as all models are, according to George Box at least), independence and others; the question is whether it is still sensible enough so that it makes sense to think about the underlying reality in terms of the model. An appropriate random sampling method is a device that makes some (but not all) of the model assumptions plausible. In the absence of such a sampling method, one needs to think about whether and how the way the sample was actually collected can affect the conclusions that are made from the confidence interval. The confidence interval itself is a mathematically well defined set of numbers \\- there's nothing wrong with it. What is the problem is really how this is interpreted and used in practice. There are many procedures for collecting samples that will invalidate the model in critical ways, thus invalidating conclusions (take for example something that was recently discussed on Andrew Gelman's blog, researchers doing animal experiments grabbing whatever mouse comes to their hand from the cage, which systematically will choose mice that move more, and are potentially more healthy and energetic).\n\nHowever, in other cases even critical appraisal does not throw up clear reasons why a sample might deviate systematically from a proper random sample, and confidence intervals are also interpreted cautiously as potentially imprecise indicators of uncertainty, maybe just for comparing different aspects in a study where the same data collection was used across the board, and then the standard confidence interval may be OK. It's not without risks (there can be problems that the researchers miss), but then model\\-based reasoning always comes with this kind of risk, even with \"proper\" random sampling.\n\nOf course what whuber alludes to in their comment to the other answer is also true \\- there may be a model for the specific non\\-i.i.d. sampling mechanism that has actually been applied, and this can be used to compute more appropriate confidence intervals in that case."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about sampling methods and confidence intervals, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducts a study using purposive sampling to investigate the impact of a new teaching method on student performance.

Which of the following best describes the validity and interpretation of these confidence intervals?\n\nA) The confidence intervals are valid and can be interpreted normally, as the sample size is sufficient for calculation.\n\nB) The confidence intervals are mathematically correct but may lead to misleading conclusions due to potential biases in the sampling method.\n\nC) The confidence intervals are invalid and should not be calculated at all when using non-probability sampling methods.\n\nD) The confidence intervals are only valid if the researcher can prove that the purposive sample is representative of the population.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B because it captures the nuanced understanding presented in the top answer. \n\nThe confidence interval itself, as a mathematical construct, is not inherently wrong - it can be calculated from any sample. However, the interpretation and practical use of these intervals become problematic when non-probability sampling methods like purposive sampling are used.\n\nThe key issue is that confidence intervals are based on probability models that assume random sampling. Purposive sampling introduces potential biases that may violate these assumptions. While the calculations can still be performed (ruling out option C), and a sample size exists (addressing the concern in option A), the resulting intervals may not accurately represent the uncertainty in the population.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it oversimplifies the issue. Even if a researcher argues for representativeness, it doesn't fully address the underlying model assumptions.\n\nThe correct answer (B) acknowledges that while the confidence intervals can be mathematically calculated, their interpretation requires careful consideration of how the sampling method might affect conclusions. This aligns with the documentation's emphasis on critical appraisal of the sampling process and cautious interpretation of results when standard random sampling is not used.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate concepts of sampling methods, statistical modeling, and practical interpretation of results, requiring a higher level of critical thinking about research methodology."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/10", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/140208", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/45649/"], "docs_id": 140208, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is what it reads but I do not understand why.\n\n> \\[2016\\-10\\-10 17:40:20]\\[INFO]\\[mode: settings]\\[stage: integrity\n>  check]\\[step: Settings Step]: started\n> \n> \n> 100% \\[\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=] Remaining Time: 1 sec\n> \n> \n> \\[2016\\-10\\-10 17:40:20]\\[ERROR]: Integrity check failed due to\n>  \"core\\_config\\_data\" document does not exist in the source resource\n>  \\[2016\\-10\\-10 17:40:20]\\[INFO]\\[mode: settings]\\[stage: integrity\n>  check]\\[step: Stores Step]: started\n> \n> \n> 100% \\[\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=] Remaining Time: 1 sec\n> \n> \n> \\[Migration\\\\Exception] Integrity Check failed migrate:settings\n>  \\[\\-r\\|\\-\\-reset] config\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My error was that I did not have a source prefix defined in config.xml file.\n\nI had to change `<source_prefix />` to `<source_prefix>gfit_</source_prefix>`"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A developer is troubleshooting a failed migration process for a StackExchange application.

This suggests that the migration process couldn't locate essential configuration data, likely due to the empty source prefix in the config.xml file. \n\nThe correct configuration of `<source_prefix>gfit_</source_prefix>` implies that the system expects configuration data to be prefixed with \"gfit_\" in the source database. Without this prefix, the migration tool cannot locate critical configuration information.\n\nOption A is the most likely scenario because:\n\n1. The integrity check fails early in the process, as evidenced by the error occurring during the \"settings\" mode and \"integrity check\" stage.\n2.

This means there is unbalanced allocation flow (one thread allocates, another thread frees) which makes practically any reasonable allocator slow, meaning only few million blocks per second of performance.\n\nAlso, you cannot use blocking queues to transfer work blocks from one thread to another thread at a performance of more than few million operations per second unless doing some weird performance\\-enhancing tricks.\n\nNow, I don't know how big is you task rate.

The top answer explicitly states that for a high-throughput application (processing \"over million packets per second\"), approach (2) - creating a cluster and load balancing - provided significantly better performance than offloading to workers.\n\n2. The explanation highlights that for applications dealing with millions of tasks per second, the worker approach (option A) becomes inefficient due to inter-CPU communication costs and memory allocation imbalances.\n\n3.

This approach allows for code reuse while maintaining flexibility and type safety. By creating a CustomerOperation functional interface and modifying the common method to accept this interface as a parameter, we can pass method references (Bank::addCustomerTransaction and Bank::addCustomer) to determine the final operation. This solution:\n\n1. Reduces code duplication effectively\n2. Leverages Java 8+ functional programming features\n3. Maintains type safety and compile-time checking\n4. Allows for easy extension with new operations in the future\n5. Keeps the code clean and readable without introducing complex patterns or reflection\n\nOptions A and B are valid but less optimal.

The persistence of the problem after changing SIDs and clearing cookies, combined with the temporary resolution after resetting IE8, suggests a deeper, hardware-level cause. \n\nThe most likely explanation is that the machines are using the same hardware-based unique identifier for web authentication. When websites implement advanced tracking or authentication methods, they sometimes use hardware identifiers (like MAC addresses or other unique hardware tokens) to create more persistent \"fingerprints\" of devices. \n\nCloning the entire system likely copied this hardware identifier, causing websites to treat both machines as the same device. This would explain why changing software-level identifiers (like SIDs) or clearing typical browser data doesn't resolve the issue permanently.\n\nThe temporary fix after resetting IE8 might occur because the reset temporarily disrupts the browser's access to this hardware identifier or resets some cached version of it.

FoxSaver, as a Firefox plugin, can display a slideshow on a single monitor while the computer is in use, meeting the requirement of keeping other monitors unaffected.\n2. FoxSaver can pull images from both online sources and local directories, providing flexibility in content management.\n3. The Picasa screensaver can be used when the PC is locked, addressing the requirement for continuous operation in locked state.\n4. By pointing both FoxSaver and Picasa screensaver to the same directory, a consistent experience can be maintained across both locked and unlocked states.\n5. This solution doesn't require custom development or paid software, addressing the user's preference for a free solution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a custom screensaver would only work when the PC is idle or locked, not while the user is actively using the computer. Option C is flawed because AutoWallpaper is paid software and would require significant modification to meet all requirements. Option D, while potentially viable, would require extensive development effort and may not address the locked-state requirement as effectively as the Picasa screensaver.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze requirements, evaluate different solutions, and apply them to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/06", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/309768", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/88283/"], "docs_id": 309768, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am building an e\\-commerce app to sell products.

This is likely because the wrong block class is being used. The developer used \"Magento\\Catalog\\Block\\Navigation\" which is not designed for product listing and doesn't provide the necessary methods for handling product collections.\n\nThe correct approach, as shown in the top answer, is to use \"Magento\\Catalog\\Block\\Product\\ListProduct\" as the block class. This class is specifically designed for product listing pages and provides the necessary methods to handle product collections, including the count() method that was causing the error.\n\nAdditionally, the correct implementation includes adding the toolbar block and other necessary elements for a fully functional product listing page.

They are using PCA to ensure that the numeric input data is linearly independent. The intended response variable is not being included in the PCA. I think this is a mistake, because it fails to take into consideration how much a dimension of low variance in the explanatory data can impact the response. \n\nIntuitively, if I have two explanatory variables, they fall on a plane. If I run a PCA on those two variables alone (excluding the response variable), and PC1 explains 95% of the variance, I *might* conclude I can safely ignore PC2\\. This implies that the response and the explanatory variables together form what is mostly a 2\\-D space, and linearity implies that the responses lie approximately along a line through that 2\\-D plane. \n\nYet we haven't taken the responses into account yet. If in fact the responses vary sharply in the PC2 dimension, then linearity implies they lie roughly not along a 1\\-D line, but rather lie close to a sharply tilted plane. We will be ignoring that sharp tilt, effectively making predictions that assume the plane of responses is flat with respect to PC2\\.\n\nMy contention is, if we throw out PC2 because PC1 explains 95% of the variance in the explanatory variables alone, then we have a potentially far inferior model to one that leaves PC2 in. My gut tells me that this is a problem, and that it goes away when the response variable is included in the PCA. That is, *only then* will we be safe in assuming that if PC1 explains 95% of the variance, we are being reasonable in disregarding PC2\\.\n\nAm I right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: PCA is a data reduction technique. It maximizes the variance in the original variable set accounted for by a relatively small number of components, which are weighted linear composites of the original variables. It does not maximize for predictive utility, but purely for data reduction. Therefore there is no particular reason to expect the component to be well related to the outcome. Whereas there *are* substantial red flags to incorporating the outcome into the modeling of its predictor.\n\nIf you want to maximize for predictive utility of the components, I suggest looking into Partial Least Squares (PLS) modeling (sometimes called PLS\\-SEM). PLS derives the weights for the PLS variate (component) so as to maximize the variate's correlation with some criterion variable, which can be a single variable or another PLS variate (as one would do with canonical correlation)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A community ecologist is preparing data for a Linear Mixed Effects model and wants to reduce the dimensionality of their explanatory variables using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The answer states, \"PLS derives the weights for the PLS variate (component) so as to maximize the variate's correlation with some criterion variable.\"\n\n4.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to lead to a valid proof while also providing insight into the relationship between trigonometric functions and algebraic inequalities?\n\nA) Using the double angle formula for sin40\u00b0 and comparing it directly to \u221a(3/7)\nB) Expressing sin40\u00b0 in terms of sin20\u00b0 and cos20\u00b0, then manipulating the inequality\nC) Rewriting the inequality in terms of sin10\u00b0 and solving a cubic equation\nD) Applying the Maclaurin series expansion for sine and comparing term by term\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most insightful and elegant approach to this proof is option C, which involves rewriting the inequality in terms of sin10\u00b0 and solving a cubic equation. This method, as demonstrated in the top answer, provides several key insights:\n\n1. It transforms the problem from dealing with sin40\u00b0 to sin10\u00b0, which simplifies the trigonometric manipulation.\n2. It leads to the creation of a cubic equation f(x) = x\u00b3 - (3/4)x + 1/8, where x = sin10\u00b0.\n3. By evaluating f(1/7), we can prove that sin10\u00b0 > 1/7, which is equivalent to the original inequality.\n4. This approach also provides additional information about the uniqueness of the solution in the interval (0, 1/2].\n\nWhile options A and B are valid trigonometric approaches, they don't provide as much insight into the algebraic nature of the problem. Option D, using Maclaurin series, would be unnecessarily complex for this proof and might not lead to a conclusive result without using a calculator.\n\nThis question requires students to analyze different problem-solving strategies, apply knowledge of trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation, and recognize the most efficient and insightful approach to the proof.

They observe that the number of new bacteria added each day follows the pattern of triangular numbers, with the first day having 1 new bacterium, the second day having 3 new bacteria, the third day having 6 new bacteria, and so on. If this pattern continues, what is the total number of bacteria added over a 30-day period?\n\nA) 4960\nB) 4495\nC) 5425\nD) 4650\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires applying the formula for the sum of triangular numbers T(n) to a real-world scenario. Let's break it down:\n\n1) The pattern described follows triangular numbers, where t(1) = 1, t(2) = 3, t(3) = 6, etc.\n\n2) We need to find the sum of the first 30 triangular numbers, which is represented by T(30).\n\n3) The formula for T(n) is given as: T(n) = n(n+1)(n+2) / 6\n\n4) Plugging in n = 30:\n   T(30) = 30(30+1)(30+2) / 6\n         = 30 * 31 * 32 / 6\n         = 4960\n\n5) However, this is not the correct answer. The trick here is to recognize that this formula gives us the sum of the first 30 triangular numbers, but the question asks for the total number of bacteria added, which is actually T(30) - T(1).\n\n6) T(1) = 1(1+1)(1+2) / 6 = 1\n\n7) Therefore, the correct answer is 4960 - 1 = 4959\n\n8) The closest option to 4959 is 4495 (option B).\n\nThis question tests the ability to:\n1) Recognize the application of triangular numbers in a growth scenario\n2) Correctly apply the formula for the sum of triangular numbers\n3) Critically analyze the question to realize that a simple application of the formula is not sufficient\n4) Perform accurate calculations with large numbers\n\nThe distractors are carefully chosen:\nA) 4960 represents the result if the student forgets to subtract T(1)\nC) 5425 could result from a calculation error or misapplication of the formula\nD) 4650 is close enough to seem plausible but is incorrect"}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/27", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41902478", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1332549/"], "docs_id": 41902478, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an app that use [android\\-maps\\-utils](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-utils) and [glide for marker icons](https://github.com/bumptech/glide).  \n\nI got an error report using Firebase crash reporting which I can't track in source code because `gms.maps.model.Marker.setIcon` is private, so I'm asking for some help with this problem.  \n\nThe follow part of the question is divided into:  \n\n* What the user was doing\n* What firebase crash reported to me\n* Some project configs\n* What I tried/found trying to understand/fix it\n\n**What the user was doing**  \n\nHe was zooming in and out in a map (`Fragment` that uses `com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment`)\n\n**What firebase crash reported to me**  \n\n> Exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unmanaged descriptor  \n> \n>  com.google.maps.api.android.lib6\\.common.k.b (:com.google.android.gms.DynamiteModulesB:162\\)  \n> \n>  com.google.maps.api.android.lib6\\.impl.o.c (:com.google.android.gms.DynamiteModulesB:75\\)  \n> \n>  com.google.maps.api.android.lib6\\.impl.db.a (:com.google.android.gms.DynamiteModulesB:334\\)  \n> \n>  com.google.android.gms.maps.model.internal.q.onTransact (:com.google.android.gms.DynamiteModulesB:204\\)  \n> \n>  android.os.Binder.transact (Binder.java:387\\)  \n> \n>  com.google.android.gms.maps.model.internal.zzf$zza$zza.zzL ()\n>  com.google.android.gms.maps.model.Marker.setIcon ()  \n> \n>  co.com.spyspot.ui.content.sucursal.SucursalRender$CustomSimpleTarget.onResourceReady (SucursalRender.java:156\\)  \n> \n>  co.com.spyspot.ui.content.sucursal.SucursalRender$CustomSimpleTarget.onResourceReady (SucursalRender.java:130\\)  \n> \n>  com.bumptech.glide.request.GenericRequest.onResourceReady (GenericRequest.java:525\\)  \n> \n>  com.bumptech.glide.request.GenericRequest.onResourceReady (GenericRequest.java:507\\)  \n> \n>  com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.EngineJob.handleResultOnMainThread (EngineJob.java:158\\)  \n> \n>  com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.EngineJob.access$100 (EngineJob.java:22\\)  \n> \n>  com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.EngineJob$MainThreadCallback.handleMessage (EngineJob.java:202\\)  \n> \n>  android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage (Handler.java:98\\)  \n> \n>  android.os.Looper.loop (Looper.java:148\\)  \n> \n>  android.app.ActivityThread.main (ActivityThread.java:5443\\)  \n> \n>  java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke (Method.java)  \n> \n>  com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run (ZygoteInit.java:728\\)  \n> \n>  com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main (ZygoteInit.java:618\\)\n\nAnd:  \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW2y6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW2y6.png)\n\n**Some project configs**  \n\n* I'm using a Custom Render (`SucursalRender extends DefaultClusterRenderer<Sucursal>`)\n* I'm downloading the Marker icon with Glide like I said before: `Glide.with(context).load(id).fitCenter().placeholder(R.drawable.ic_no_image).into(simpleTarget);`\n\nThe `simpleTarget` is where I handle the images downloaded/cached for Glide.

Given this scenario and the provided code snippets, what is the most likely cause of the crash and the best approach to resolve it?\n\nA) The Glide library is not properly releasing memory, causing a resource leak that leads to the crash when setting marker icons\nB) The custom IconGenerator is creating invalid Bitmap objects, resulting in the \"Unmanaged descriptor\" error when setting marker icons\nC) The crash is occurring because markers are being accessed after they have been removed from the map due to clustering operations\nD) The ClusterManager is not properly synchronizing marker updates, leading to race conditions when setting icons on markers\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the crash is that markers are being accessed after they have been removed from the map, which is a common issue when working with clustering in Google Maps. This conclusion is supported by several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The crash occurs during zooming operations, which typically trigger cluster updates and marker removals/additions.\n2. The error stack trace shows that the crash happens in the `setIcon` method of the `Marker` class.\n3. The Google Maps API documentation states that \"After a marker has been removed, the behavior of all its methods is undefined.\"\n4. The crash occurs in the `CustomSimpleTarget` class, which is used to update marker icons asynchronously after they have been rendered.\n\nThe best approach to resolve this issue is to implement a check to ensure that markers are still valid before attempting to update their icons. The top answer suggests using the `setTag` and `getTag` methods of the `Marker` class as a workaround, since the tag is set to null when a marker is removed from the map.\n\nThis solution addresses the root cause by preventing attempts to modify removed markers, rather than simply catching the exception or addressing symptoms of the problem. It also aligns with the asynchronous nature of image loading and marker updates in the given code.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are less likely causes or less effective solutions:\nA) While memory issues with Glide are possible, they wouldn't typically result in this specific error.\nB) The custom IconGenerator isn't directly related to the \"Unmanaged descriptor\" error.\nD) While synchronization issues are possible, the error is more indicative of accessing removed objects than race conditions.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Google Maps API, clustering, asynchronous operations) and tests the ability to analyze a complex real-world scenario, making it suitable for assessing higher-level cognitive skills."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/11/11", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69989", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/1/"], "docs_id": 69989, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Right now, the maximum privilege \"unlock\" is at 10k reputation:\n\n<https://meta.stackoverflow.com/privileges>\n\nWe're considering adding a new 20k reputation privilege, but having a hard time figuring out exactly what it should be.\n\nTwo guidelines:\n\n1.

Users can successfully VPN into the network and ping internal hosts, but they cannot access a mail server on port 25 that is accessible from the internet. Given this scenario, what is the most likely cause of the issue and the best solution?\n\nA) The VPN tunnel is not configured to allow access to forwarded ports; implement split tunneling\nB) NAT is interfering with VPN traffic; disable NAT for VPN client IP ranges\nC) The static NAT rule is taking precedence over VPN routing; create a route map to exclude VPN traffic from the NAT rule\nD) Port 25 is blocked by default on most VPNs; explicitly allow outbound traffic on port 25 for VPN users\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of a complex networking scenario involving VPN, NAT, and port forwarding. The key to solving this issue lies in understanding the interaction between NAT rules and VPN routing.\n\nThe static NAT rule (ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.x.x 25 interface myinterface 25) is likely taking precedence over the VPN routing for incoming connections. This means that when VPN users try to access the mail server on port 25, the router is attempting to apply the NAT rule instead of routing the traffic directly to the internal IP.\n\nThe best solution, as suggested in the top answer, is to create a route map that excludes VPN traffic from the NAT rule. This allows the VPN traffic to be routed directly to the internal IP without interference from the NAT rule, while still maintaining the port forwarding for external access.\n\nOption A is incorrect because split tunneling would not resolve this specific issue and could introduce security risks. Option B is a misconception; disabling NAT for VPN clients would break other functionality.

I did the replacement myself without apparent incident.\n\nThereafter, though, I noticed that the exposed metal screws on the bottom of the case can burn/tingle my exposed skin if the machine is plugged in.

They might place a new DC in / magsafe board in and re\\-test to see if that's the cause. They would of course test with their adapter and then remove the components in the main unibody section to look for loose screws, scortch marks or other signs of burns or liquid damage to the components that might cause this abnormal current situation:\n\n* battery\n* rear vent\n* fan\n* optical drive\n* logic board\n\nOnce you've gone over these \\- hopefully you can visually see the problem or remove whatever is grounding current / voltage to the frame."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is troubleshooting a 2009 MacBook that exhibits a tingling sensation on its metal screws when plugged in.

Currently there is no way to influence which items you find; it is completely random. There is a limit to the number of items you can find per day, and the longer you spend not playing, the more frequently you'll find items for a while once you come back to the game.\n\nWeapons like the Blutsauger can be found via achievement also for a couple reasons. Valve set a precedent with that because the Medic pack and some others were released before the random drop system, and that was the only way to get the items at that time. It is also because competitive players need access to all the items so that they can be on equal footing with each other, so there needs to be a way to reliably get a specific item.

The correct answer is D, based on the information provided: \"the longer you spend not playing, the more frequently you'll find items for a while once you come back to the game.\" This explains why the player received an item after a long break.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation states the player only has one Medic-related achievement, and playing as Scout wouldn't contribute to Medic achievements.\n\nOption B is a plausible distractor but is incorrect.

The correct answer is D because the documentation states that \"every consistent propositional logic that extends intuitionistic logic is a sublogic of classical logic.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation proves that if L proves a formula not provable in classical logic, it would be inconsistent. This is shown through the argument involving substitution and evaluation of variable-free formulas.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it's too restrictive. The documentation implies the existence of \"intermediate logics\" between intuitionistic and classical logic, so L doesn't have to be exactly equivalent to either.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it contradicts the main point of the documentation. If L is consistent and extends intuitionistic logic, it cannot be inconsistent with classical logic.\n\nOption D correctly captures the key insight from the documentation.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how Jenkins runs and manages permissions.\n\nThe error log shows an AccessDeniedException for a Maven file, despite the file having 777 permissions. This indicates that the issue is not with the file permissions themselves, but with how Jenkins is accessing the file.\n\nThe documentation mentions that running Jenkins manually (e.g., via `java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war`) can cause ownership issues, as it changes the owner to the user who started the process.

The OS-specific format string is determined only once and stored in a variable, which can be reused for multiple files without repetitive OS checks.\n3. It leverages the `uname` command with pattern matching to detect the OS, as shown in the documentation.\n4.

I don't want to sync entire photo library and I definately do not want to share them online.\n\nSo far I've been using the \"Export as HTML page..\" with a custom template to export starred pictures to a folder and the syncing that folder with the iPhone. However this requires some manual steps and takes a while (exporting will copy and resize pictures).\n\nAnother approach I tried is to create symlinks to starred photos in a folder (like [this](http://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/#!category-topic/picasa/picasa-for-windows/ShTC2P9QI1k)) and sync that with the iPhone. This also requires some manual steps but it's a bit faster to generate the folder. However, syncing with iPhone via iTunes takes a lot of time because iTunes will resize the pictures (actually it rebuilds some sort of \"iPod photo cache\").\n\nI keep hoping there's a simpler way to do this!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You could set up the symlink script to run daily (or however often you possibly sync your device) to at least generate the symlink folder automatically. If you are uncomfortable writing the plists for the LaunchDeamons, you can use an app like [Lingon](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lingon/id411211026?mt=12) to generate them. At this point, they may not even need to be symlinks, just a copied 'export' if you will, using the same logic.\n\nEither way, you are still stuck doing the 'iPod Photo Cache'. I think the only reason this is slightly faster when using Aperture or iPhoto is due to them having various thumbnails and other sizes rendered, but it still takes time to process, especially the first time.\n\nAssuming smaller files would actually process faster, you could also update the script that exports the stared items with symlinks to actually copy the files elsewhere, and then resize them using a tool like `sips`. \n\nFor example, `sips -Z 1024 image.jpg` would resize the image down to 1024x768, retaining the aspect ration ([more examples can be found on this blog](http://www.ainotenshi.org/818/resizing-images-using-the-command-line), or elsewhere online).\n\nYou may have to find which process works best for you and your workflow, and where the bottle neck would be. Again, if this export could be daily, outside of the actual sync to your device, that folder could always 'be ready'. \n\nThen, you just keep your iOS device sync the same, but it can process smaller files, and you have automated most of the process. The iPod Photo Cache may also be incremental, so if these files stay the same, and then just have new ones added, only the new ones are added to the cache as well."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about syncing starred photos from Picasa to iPhone/iPad, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A user wants to automate the process of syncing their starred Picasa photos to their iPhone while minimizing manual steps and processing time.

Option C is the correct answer because it addresses several key issues:\n\n1. Automation: By implementing a script, the process becomes automated, reducing manual steps.\n2.

Avoids limitations: It doesn't rely on HTML export or symlinks, which had drawbacks mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOption A is suboptimal because it involves manual steps and time-consuming exports.

Option D doesn't directly address the user's specific needs and may introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis solution integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including automation, file management, and optimization techniques, while applying them to solve a real-world problem.

For spheres in contact, r = 2R, where R is the radius of each sphere.\n\n5. The mass of each sphere is proportional to its volume: M \u221d R^3\n\n6. Substituting these into the force equation:\n   F \u221d (R^3 * R^3) / (2R)^2 = R^6 / R^2 = R^4\n\n7. Therefore, the gravitational force is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts (gravitational force, geometry of spheres, mass-volume relationship) and the application of these concepts to a specific scenario. It also addresses a common misconception (option A) that might arise from considering only the inverse square law without accounting for the changing mass."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/05", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63386", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/183/"], "docs_id": 63386, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm relatively familiar with the distinction between the terms statistic and parameter. I see a statistic as the value obtained from applying a function to the sample data. However, most examples of parameters relate to defining a parametric distribution. A common example is the mean and standard deviation to parameterise the normal distribution or the coefficients and error variance to parameterise a linear regression.\n\nHowever, there are many other values of the population distribution that are less prototypical (e.g., minimum, maximum, r\\-square in multiple regression, the .25 quantile, median, the number of predictors with non\\-zero coefficients, skewness, the number of correlations in a correlation matrix greater than .3, etc.). \n\nThus, **my questions** are:\n\n* Should any quantitative property of a population be labelled a \"parameter\"?\n* If yes, then why?\n* If no, what characteristics should not be labelled a parameter? What should they be labelled? And why?\n\n### Elaboration on confusion\n\nThe Wikipedia article on estimators states:\n\n> An \"estimator\" or \"point estimate\" is a statistic (that is, a function\n>  of the data) that is used to infer the value of an unknown parameter\n>  in a statistical model.\n\nBut I can define the unknown value as .25 quantile and I can develop an estimator for that unknown. I.e., not all quantitative properties of a population are parameters in the same way that say the mean and sd are parameters of a normal distribution, yet it is legitimate to seek to estimate any quantitative population property. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with many questions on definitions, answers need to have an eye both on the underlying principles and on the ways terms are used in practice, which can often be at least a little loose or inconsistent, even by individuals who are well informed, and more importantly, variable from community to community. \n\nOne common principle is that a statistic is a property of a sample, and a known constant, and a parameter is the corresponding property of the population, and so an unknown constant. The word \"corresponding\" is to be understood as quite elastic here. Incidentally, precisely this distinction and precisely this terminology are less than a century old, having being introduced by R.A. Fisher. \n\nBut \n\n1. A set\\-up of sample and population doesn't characterise all our own problems. Time series are one major class of examples in which the idea is rather of an underlying generating process, and something like that is arguably the deeper and more general idea.\n2. There are set\\-ups in which parameters change. Again, time series analysis provides examples.\n3. To the main point here, we don't in practice think of all the properties of a population or process as parameters. If some procedure assumes a model of a normal distribution, then the minimum and maximum are not parameters. (Indeed, according to the model, the minimum and maximum are arbitrarily large negative and positive numbers any way, not that that should worry us.)\n\nI would say that for once Wikipedia is pointing in the right direction here, and practice and principle are both respected if we say that **a parameter is whatever we are estimating**. \n\nThis helps too with other questions that have caused puzzlement. For example, if we calculate a 25% trimmed mean, what we are estimating? A reasonable answer is the corresponding property of the population, which in effect is defined by the estimation method. One terminology is that an estimator has an estimand, whatever it is estimating. Starting with some Platonic idea of a property \"out there\" (say the mode of a distribution) and thinking how to estimate that is reasonable, as is thinking up good recipes for analysing data and thinking through what they imply when regarded as inference. \n\nAs often in applied mathematics or science, there is a twofold aspect to a parameter. We often think of it as something real out there which we are discovering, but it is also true that it is something defined by our model of the process, so that it has no meaning outside the context of the model.\n\nTwo quite different points:\n\n1. Many scientists use the word \"parameter\" in the way that statisticians use variable. I have a scientist persona as well as a statistical one, and I would say that is unfortunate. Variables and properties are better words.\n2. It is remarkably common in wider English usage that parameter is thought to mean limits or bounds, which may stem from some original confusion between \"parameter\" and \"perimeter\".\n\n**A note on the estimand point of view**\n\nThe classical position is that we identify a parameter in advance and then decide how to estimate it, and this remains majority practice, but reversing the process is not absurd and can be helpful for some problems. I call this the estimand point of view. It has been in the literature for at least 50 years. Tukey (1962, p.60\\) urged that \n\n\"We must give even more attention to starting with an estimator and discovering what is a reasonable estimand, to discovering what is it reasonable to think of\nthe estimator as estimating.\"\n\nA similar point of view has been elaborated formally in considerable detail and depth by Bickel and Lehmann (1975\\) and informally with considerable lucidity by Mosteller and Tukey (1977, pp.32\\-34\\). \n\nThere is also an elementary version. Using\n(say) sample median or geometric mean to estimate the corresponding\npopulation parameter makes sense regardless of whether the underlying\ndistribution is symmetric, and the same goodwill can be extended to (e.g.) \nsample trimmed means, which are regarded as estimators of their\npopulation counterparts. \n\nBickel, P.J. and E.L.

Every method used to handle multicollinearity will handle it to some extent \\- better or worse \\- often risking removing of important variables, when the filter is stronger or just by bad luck. One may think about it as of a trade\\-off and every cure at some point might be worse than disease.\n\nThis is the reason of such articles as [Performance of some variable selection methods when multicollinearity is present](http://automatica.dei.unipd.it/public/Schenato/PSC/2010_2011/gruppo4-Building_termo_identification/IdentificazioneTermodinamica20072008/Biblio/Biblio-PLS/Performance%20of%20some%20variable%20selection%20methods%20when%20multicollinearity.pdf), which give more complex, but better\\-than\\-general answers. The main conclusion from their existence is that different methods may perform differently in different contexts.\n\nThere are are also many methods and their variants. You should look at every method separately. You mentioned two methods \\- LASSO and forward selection:\n\n**LASSO**\n\nLASSO is a special case of *Penalized Regresion* methods. These methods were designed to handle multicollinearity. The question is if what they do is what you want. The basic property of LASSO is that from a bunch of correlated variables it tends to pick one of them and discard the others. You do not have to be satisfied with LASSO picks (see comments). You can control them to some extent with trade\\-off parameter $\\\\lambda$, which describes the strength of penalty for the coefficient values. It controls how severe levels of multicollinearity LASSO will address, but do not control what variables will be picked, when multicollinearity is met.\n\nFor a quick informations about LASSO in R, I would suggest [Glmnet Vignette](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) by Hastie \\& Qian.\n\n**Forward selection**\n\nThis method is part of group of methods called *Stepwise Regression*. They differ not only by step procedure (forward, backwards, all possibilities and others), but also by criterion \\- they use for example p\\-values, R$^2$, MSE, AIC, BIC. Then they will perform differently when challenged by multicollinearity.\n\nTo show the last very shortly \\- forward selection adding variables by R$^2$ is said to be good choice for cases with multicollinearity, while backward elimination removing by p\\-value will never drop two collinear variables in situation when they both are significant, especially when highly biased. As in the case of LASSO, you might not be satisfied with the chosen variables for many reasons.\n\n---\n\nPRACTICAL NOTE: Sometimes is much easier just to run some things and then look how they performed.

I think it's really cool that we can partition a set using equivalence relations. I'm also someone who doesn't do math for its applications but for its beauty. However...\n\n> **Why do we care about equivalence relations?**\n\nFor a specific equivalence relation reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity are always immediate (at least from what I have seen). You can e.g. define modulo with equivalence relations. Suppose you have never even heard of the equivalence relations, though. You could still define modulo without a problem.\n\nExample: Just today, we've defined connected components of a graph [using equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)) in class. Why would you want to do that? Why not use standard graph theory language? I don't see the reason for using equivalence relations to introduce connected components \\- what exactly is it that we gain by introducing equivalence classes?\n\nSo in summary, I kind of lack a **motivation** for equivalence relations and would appreciate examples that could enlighten me on that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the context of the connected components of a graph, the idea isn't very interesting, because the picture for connected components of a graph is already so clear and easy to understand geometrically.\n\nBut one of the principal techniques of mathematics is to find the underlying structure in one context, and then try to make an abstract model of it that might apply in other contexts as well. By doing this, we understand the connections between the two contexts, and we can sometimes solve difficult problems in one context by applying tools imported from some other context.\n\nWe don't formulate the idea of a partition or an equivalence relation because we want to study the connected components of graphs. For that it's unnecessary, because graph components are simple.\n\nBut that simplicity makes graph theory a good place to start understanding the idea of an equivalence relation, so that when you happen across it in a different context, where it might be more useful, you can recognize it and say \u201coh, we can model this with an equivalence relation, which means that it partitions the structure into components, and I already know some theorems about how that will work and some techniques I can use.\u201d\n\nAnd you have a language for talking about these things, which can be applied in many different situations, so that when you say \u201cconsider the equivalence classes of (something) under (some relation)\u201d you and the people you are talking to instantly get an idea of what is going on: these classes are disjoint, every object is in exactly one class, and so on, just like the components of a graph.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n1. What are fractions? They are notations of the form $\\\\frac ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b$ is not zero. What are the rational numbers? Just fractions? No, they are the equivalence classes of fractions under the relation that says $\\\\frac ab \\\\equiv \\\\frac cd$ if $ad\\=bc$, because for example $\\\\frac 36$ and $\\\\frac8{16}$ are the same rational number. Okay, big deal, we already know all about rational numbers. But having identified the process, we can now apply it to all sorts of things more complicated than the integers. Can we do the same construction for, say, polynomials? (We can!) Are the results useful and interesting? (They are!)\n2. We can relate the complex numbers to polynomials by defining each complex number as a part of a partition induced on the set of polynomials by a certain equivalence relation. By using different equivalence relations we can define different systems analogous to the complex numbers and use them to study properties of polynomials.\n3. Mathematics has a structure called a group, which is a model of a way in which a thing can have symmetry. There is an important \u201cquotient\u201d operation on a group which arises when you consider certain symmetries to be \u201cequivalent\u201d; the quotient is a group that describes the symmetries of the resulting equivalence classes.\n4. This is a very specific example: Consider some geometric object which has an *even* number of symmetries. Then the object must have at least one symmetry which is an \u201cinvolution\u201d: this means that if you perform the symmetry exactly twice, the object is back in its original position. Objects without involutions must have an odd number of symmetries! (An example is a table\\-saw blade with 37 teeth.) I hope this is not obvious! But it is very easy to show if you consider the right equivalence relation on the symmetries.\n5. An important technique in physics is to analyze the symmetries of the universe itself. For example, the laws of conservation of momentum and energy are consequences of certain symmetries of space\\-time. The abstract structure of spaces with these symmetries is often best understood as a particular quotient group.\n6. This \u201cquotient\u201d idea applies in other situations too. Many kinds of mathematical structures are best understood as quotients, in this sense. For example, in topology we often view a circle as being a quotient of a line segment, under the equivalence relation that says that the two endpoints are equivalent. When we want to deal with a M\u00f6bius strip, we often formulate it as a certain quotient of a rectangle, where the equivalence relation makes certain points on the edge of the rectangle equivalent. Many related objects, much weirder than the M\u00f6bius strip, can be dealt with similarly.\n\nWe don't study the identification between partitions and equivalence relations just because it is cool. It is also useful in understanding other things. Partitions and equivalence relations pop up everywhere. Sometimes the partition is obvious, but the equivalence relation is easier to understand; then it is helpful to reinterpret the partition as an equivalence relation. Sometimes it is useful to go in the other direction instead."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about equivalence relations, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is designing a system to classify and group similar bug reports in a large-scale project management tool.

If you have that\n$$P\\=M^{\\-1}DM$$\nthen\n$$P^n\\=M^{\\-1}D^n M$$\n\nThe main diagonal of $D$ has the eigenvalues of $P$.

These systems must be indeterminate, and their solutions must be the $1$\\-dimensional spaces generated by the eigenvectors.\n\nFor example, for the eigenvalue $1$ we have\n$$\\\\begin{pmatrix}p\\&1\\-p\\\\\\\\1\\-q\\&q\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}x\\_1\\\\\\\\y\\_1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}x\\_1\\\\\\\\y\\_1\\\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThis yields:\n$$(p\\-1\\)x\\_1\\+(1\\-p)y\\_1\\=0$$\nor the equivalent equation\n$$(1\\-q)x\\_1\\+(q\\-1\\)y\\_1\\=0$$\nThat is, an eigenvector for this eigenvalue will be any nonzero vector that satisfies these equations.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that the solution involved \"blowing away one of them and then adding that drive back to the other array and rebuilding it.\"\n2. This approach addresses the specific symptom of two separate arrays being displayed instead of one.\n3. It minimizes data loss risk by working with the existing drives rather than replacing them outright.\n4. It avoids potentially destructive actions like disabling RAID entirely.\n5. It's a more targeted solution than attempting a full resync, which might not address the root cause of the array splitting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediately replacing both drives is an extreme measure that doesn't address the specific issue and risks unnecessary data loss.

The documentation states, \"There is really only one way to check the construction of your driveway. You will need to select a couple of locations and using a shovel, remove the top layer to expose the base layer, then remove the base layer to the grade fill and measure the layers.\"\n3. It aligns with the advice to \"notify the general contractor or party you are purchasing the house from, as well as your lender and refuse to close until the driveway is properly built and proven to your satisfaction.\"\n4. This approach protects the homeowner's interests by ensuring compliance before closing, as emphasized in the statement, \"Stand tough, once you close it will be much more difficult to get this fixed.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because closing on the house first weakens the homeowner's position and may complicate resolution. Option B is insufficient as a visual inspection alone cannot verify the driveway's internal structure. Option D ignores the documented suspicions and advice to insist on proof of compliance.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a practical scenario, rather than relying on simple recall."}, "75": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/08", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/61034", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/8799/"], "docs_id": 61034, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many know the TV game *Countdown*, whose French version *Des chiffres et des lettres* has lasted since 1965\\.\n\nThe rules of the count are as follows: you are given natural integers $n\\_1,\\\\ldots,n\\_6$ and a target $N$.

There are $k!$ ways of ordering the numbers, $C\\_{k\\-1} \\= \\\\frac1{k}{2k\\-2 \\\\choose k\\-1}$ ways of choosing places to insert the arithmetic operations (without running out of numbers on the stack) and $4^{k\\-1}$ ways of choosing which of the four operations we will insert at each place, for a grand total of $4^{k\\-1}\\\\frac{(2k\\-2\\)!}{(k\\-1\\)!}$ ways of combining $k$ numbers with the four operations. If we are given $k$ numbers and we can work with any subset of them (as in the original formulation of $N\\_k$), then there are \n$$\n\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^k {k \\\\choose i} 4^{i\\-1}\\\\frac{(2i\\-2\\)!}{(i\\-1\\)!} \\=\n\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^k 4^{i\\-1} C\\_{i\\-1} \\\\frac{k!}{(k\\-i)!} \\\\le 16^k k! \\\\le (16k)^k\n$$\nways of choosing a subset and then arranging and combining the elements of the subset with the arithmetic operations. Hence $\\\\log N\\_k \\\\le k(\\\\log k \\+ \\\\log 16\\)$. \n\nThe lower bound is a little bit more interesting. Just by using addition and multiplication, we can prove that $N\\_{b\\+r\\-2} \\\\ge b^r \\- 1$: We take as our $b \\+ r \\- 2$ numbers $2, 3, \\\\ldots b\\-1, 1, b, \\\\ldots b^{r\\-1}$ (of course we are assuming that $b \\\\ge 2$). Then we can write any positive integer $n \\< b^r$ as $\\\\sum\\_{i\\=0}^{r\\-1} a\\_i b^i$, with $0 \\\\le a\\_i \\\\le b\\-1$, and then, by collecting the terms with a given \"digit\" $a\\_i$, we can write $n$ as a sum of terms of the form $a(b^{i\\_{a1}} \\+ \\\\ldots \\+ b^{i\\_{aj\\_a}})$, where each $a$, $0 \\\\le a \\\\le b\\-1$, appears at most once. Of course, we can throw out the term with $a\\=0$, and not write the 1 when $a\\=1$, so we can write our number with $2, 3, \\\\ldots, b\\-1, 1, b, \\\\ldots, b^{r\\-1}$. \n\nIf we allow subtraction as well we can use Francois's idea (and the same set of numbers) to show that $N\\_{b\\+r\\-2} \\\\ge ((2b \\- 1\\) ^ r \\- 1\\)/2$ when $b \\\\ge 2, r \\\\ge 1$. \n\nEven with only addition and multiplication, we obtain (roughly) $N\\_k \\\\ge (\\\\epsilon k)^{(1\\-\\\\epsilon) k}$ for $k$ large given $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, and hence $\\\\log N\\_k \\\\ge (1\\-\\\\epsilon) k \\\\log k$ when $k$ is large given $\\\\epsilon$.

It looks like power supply noise to me based on the obvious correlation between supply and output. Also the noise is periodic at about 15\\-20ms which would match 50/60hz.\n\nOpamps have a specification **power supply rejection ratio**, which says how well the opamp can isolate the output from the power supply. Looking at the datasheet for this opamp, PSRR is very good, about 140dB, but that is at DC and PSRR is frequency dependent. \n\nLooking at your second picture, I see about 1V p\\-p noise on the power rail, and 20mV on the output (not 200mV \\- wrong probe setting?). You are seeing maybe 35dB PSRR in this configuration, from 1V to 20mV. Looking at Fig 12 in the datasheet (PSRR vs Frequency) this ratio happens around 10\\-100kHz. It wouldn't be surprising if you have that sort of noise on your power rail, switching converters typically run 50khz upwards.\n\nYou should probably add some filtering on both power rails to ground using L\\-C filters. There is no easy answer on what exactly to use and it may not be simple to do this 'properly' \\- [this PDF](https://designers-guide.org/design/bypassing.pdf) has some good information. However if it were me, I would grab some power inductors and capacitors, check the cutoff frequency using [the formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit), and give it a try to see if it helps reduce the noise. For example I might try 22uH/47uF for 5kHz cutoff."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer has designed a circuit to reduce an input signal by 10x using a resistor-divider network and a unity gain op-amp buffer. The output shows significant periodic noise of about 200 mV pk-pk. Given the provided scope images and circuit details, what is the most likely cause of this noise issue and the most effective solution?\n\nA) Insufficient decoupling capacitors on the op-amp power supply pins, requiring additional high-frequency ceramic capacitors\nB) Power supply noise from the switching power supplies, needing L-C filtering on both power rails\nC) Instability in the op-amp due to lack of feedback compensation, requiring a small capacitor in the feedback loop\nD) Impedance mismatch between the op-amp output and the ADC input, necessitating a series resistor at the op-amp output\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the noise issue is most likely power supply noise from the switching power supplies, and the most effective solution is to add L-C filtering on both power rails. This conclusion is supported by several key observations from the provided information:\n\n1. The noise is periodic and correlates strongly with the power supply rail, as seen in the second scope image. This strongly suggests power supply noise as the primary culprit.\n\n2. The noise frequency (visible as about 15-20ms period in the scope image) is consistent with 50/60Hz harmonics, which could be produced by switching power supplies.\n\n3. While the op-amp (OPA188) has excellent Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) of about 140dB at DC, this ratio decreases at higher frequencies. The observed noise suggests a PSRR of about 35dB (1V p-p on power rail to 20mV p-p on output), which aligns with the PSRR vs. Frequency graph in the datasheet for frequencies in the 10-100kHz range - a typical operating range for switching power supplies.\n\n4. The existing decoupling capacitors (1\u03bcF ceramic, 100\u03bcF electrolytic, 10\u03bcF tantalum, and 0.1\u03bcF directly at the op-amp) are not sufficient to suppress this high-frequency noise.\n\n5. L-C filters on the power rails would effectively attenuate high-frequency noise from the switching power supplies before it reaches the op-amp. A suggested starting point might be 22\u03bcH/47\u03bcF for a 5kHz cutoff frequency.\n\nThis solution addresses the root cause of the noise and is likely to be more effective than the other options. Option A (additional decoupling) may help but doesn't address the primary source. Option C (feedback compensation) is unnecessary for unity gain and wouldn't significantly impact power supply noise. Option D (output resistor) might help with stability but wouldn't address the observed power supply noise issue."}, "77": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/20", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/71709", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/22916/"], "docs_id": 71709, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What would happen to the Universe if we turned off the Higgs field?\n\n(Remark: \"turning off the Higgs field\" means to set its v.e.v. to zero\\-today its value is about 246 GeV.)\n\n* Would the Z,W bosons be massive?\n* Would atoms form?\n* Would vacuum energy be zero?\n\n*Bonus*: What advantages could we obtain if we could manipulate the Higgs field as we manipulate the electromagnetic field by tuning its v.e.v. as we wished?

With masses around 80 and 90 Gev, respectively, the W and Z were the most massive particles seen at the time of discovery while the photon is massless. The difference in masses is attributed to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the hot universe cooled. The theory suggests that at very high temperatures where the equilibrium kT energies are in excess of 100 GeV, these particles are essentially identical and the weak and electromagnetic interactions were manifestations of a single force. The question of how the W and Z got so much mass in the spontaneous symmetry breaking is still a perplexing one. The symmetry\\-breaking mechanism is called a Higgs field, and requires a new boson, the Higgs boson to mediate it.\n\nSo the question really asks if one can control the symmetry [breaking energy](http://www.clab.edc.uoc.gr/materials/pc/proj/running_alphas.html) , when the [higgs field](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-higgs-boson.pdf) appears as the [electromagnetic and weak coupling constants](http://www.clab.edc.uoc.gr/materials/pc/proj/running_alphas.html) run into each other.\n\nIt is maybe good to think about an [analogue in classical physics, a magnet:](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/unify.html#c4/)\n\n> When the magnet is strongly magnetized in one direction, it would be hard to guess that the underlying interaction is actually symmetric under rotation. The magnetic field from the magnet is certainly very different if it is rotated 90 degrees, or 180 degrees. The underlying symmetry can only be seen if the energy of the system is raised \\- heating the magnet to its Curie temperature would remove the directional magnetic field and restore the rotational symmetry of the material.\n\nI find that the Curie temperature can be [a function of directions](http://journals.aps.org/archive/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.124.1373) :\n\n> In an anisotropic ferromagnet the Curie temperature is a function of the direction of the magnetization. The Curie temperature is high in easy directions, and can drop quite low in harder directions for an anisotropy energy comparable to the exchange energy. Magnetization curves as a function of temperature also depend upon the orientation. In sufficiently hard directions, the magnetization drops from a large value precipitously to zero at the Curie temperature.\n\nThis last allows one to imagine that the v.e.v. of 246GeV might be negotiable for some width, i.e. in some specific boundary conditions, but the balances that lead to symmetry breaking have to hold in order to observe the world we observe and have encoded into the standard model. So turning off for the whole universe will both not be possible or desirable ( well it did happen in the [Big Bang history](http://planck.caltech.edu/epo/epo-planckScience5.html) at o.1 ns) . Maybe some of these compactified dimensions from strings would give a handle to explore changes in v.e.v. s , if we ever are experimentally sure they exist ;) and can experiment with them. (i.e. allow to modify the boundary conditions that define the electroweak parameters for some specific experiment) \n\nAt the moment we have to pursue higher energy experiments with leptons in order to get a handle with enough accuracy to explore differences in coupling constants while approaching the unification energy. This last for the electroweak unification into one coupling constant is at a scale of 10^12 GeV ."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the Higgs field and its implications, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A theoretical physicist proposes an experiment to manipulate the Higgs field's vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) in a localized region of space.

Its main theme is exposing IObservable objects directly from the interfaces of our components.\n\n```\n// ********* Interfaces **********\ninterface IFooSource\n{\n    // this is the event-stream of objects of type Foo\n    IObservable<Foo> FooArrivals { get; }\n}\n\ninterface IBarSource\n{\n    // this is the event-stream of objects of type Bar\n    IObservable<Bar> BarArrivals { get; }\n}\n\n/ ********* Implementations *********\nclass FooSource : IFooSource\n{\n    // Here we put logic that receives Foo objects from the network and publishes them to the FooArrivals event stream.\n}\n\nclass FooSubsetsToBarConverter : IBarSource\n{\n    IFooSource fooSource;\n\n    IObservable<Bar> BarArrivals\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            // Do some fancy Rx operators on fooSource.FooArrivals, like Buffer, Window, Join and others and return IObservable<Bar>\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// this class will subscribe to the bar source and do processing\nclass BarsProcessor\n{\n    BarsProcessor(IBarSource barSource);\n    void Subscribe(); \n}\n\n// ******************* Main ************************\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var fooSource = FooSourceFactory.Create();\n        var barsProcessor = BarsProcessorFactory.Create(fooSource) // this will create FooSubsetToBarConverter and BarsProcessor\n\n        barsProcessor.Subscribe();\n        fooSource.Run(); // this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe other suggested another design that its main theme is using our own publisher/subscriber interfaces and using Rx inside the implementations only when needed.\n\n```\n//********** interfaces *********\n\ninterface IPublisher<T>\n{\n    void Subscribe(ISubscriber<T> subscriber);\n}\n\ninterface ISubscriber<T>\n{\n    Action<T> Callback { get; }\n}\n\n//********** implementations *********\n\nclass FooSource : IPublisher<Foo>\n{\n    public void Subscribe(ISubscriber<Foo> subscriber) { /* ...  */ }\n\n    // here we put logic that receives Foo objects from some source (the network?) publishes them to the registered subscribers\n}\n\nclass FooSubsetsToBarConverter  : ISubscriber<Foo>, IPublisher<Bar>\n{\n    void Callback(Foo foo)\n    {\n        // here we put logic that aggregates Foo objects and publishes Bars when we have received a subset of Foos that match our criteria\n        // maybe we use Rx here internally.\n    }\n\n    public void Subscribe(ISubscriber<Bar> subscriber) { /* ...  */ }\n}\n\nclass BarsProcessor : ISubscriber<Bar>\n{\n    void Callback(Bar bar)\n    {\n        // here we put code that processes Bar objects\n    }\n}\n\n//********** program *********\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var fooSource = fooSourceFactory.Create();\n        var barsProcessor = barsProcessorFactory.Create(fooSource) // this will create BarsProcessor and perform all the necessary subscriptions\n\n        fooSource.Run();  // this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhich one do you think is better? Exposing IObservable and making our components create new event streams from Rx operators, or defining our own publisher/subscriber interfaces and using Rx internally if needed?\n\nHere are some things to consider about the designs:\n\n* In the first design the consumer of our interfaces has the whole power of Rx at his/her fingertips and can perform any Rx operators. One of us claims this is an advantage and the other claims that this is a drawback.\n* The second design allows us to use any publisher/subscriber architecture under the hood. The first design ties us to Rx.\n* If we wish to use the power of Rx, it requires more work in the second design because we need to translate the custom publisher/subscriber implementation to Rx and back. It requires writing glue code for every class that wishes to do some event processing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think saying that `IObservable<T>` ties you to Rx is the same as saying that `IEnumerable<T>` ties you to LINQ. Yes, `IObservable<T>` is at the core of Rx and Rx lets you do a lot of things with `IObservable<T>`.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you have to use Rx to implement your classes, even if they inherit from `IObservable<T>`. And you also don't have to use Rx to work with the class, you could directly use `Subscribe()`. I believe this is also the reason why `IObservable<T>` is included in the core of the framework (it's in mscorlib since .Net 4\\), but Rx isn't.\n\nSo, unless `IObservable<T>` doesn't fit your needs, you should use it. On the plus side, you'll get the possibility to use Rx. On the negative side, you might need to wrap your implementation to make it look like `IObservable<T>`, if you decide to change the implementation later on. But you would have to do the same if you used a custom interface.\n\n`IObservable<T>` is just an interface, it doesn't tie you up to anything. But it gives you the ability to use libraries that already work with it, unlike a custom interface."}, "answer": "Certainly! I'll create a question based on the StackExchange documentation you provided:\n\nQuestion: A development team is designing a .NET application to process large volumes of streaming data. They need to implement a system where objects of type Foo are received from a network source, grouped into subsets, converted to objects of type Bar, and then processed. Which design approach would be most beneficial for long-term maintainability and flexibility?\n\nA) Use custom IPublisher<T> and ISubscriber<T> interfaces, implementing Rx internally only when needed\nB) Expose IObservable<T> directly in component interfaces and use Rx operators throughout\nC) Implement a hybrid approach using IObservable<T> for external interfaces but custom publish/subscribe internally\nD) Use traditional event-based programming with custom EventArgs classes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Exposing IObservable<T> directly in component interfaces and using Rx operators throughout (option B) is the most beneficial approach for long-term maintainability and flexibility. This design offers several advantages:\n\n1. Standardization: IObservable<T> is a standard interface in .NET, included in mscorlib since .NET 4. This means it's well-supported and understood by many developers.\n\n2. Flexibility: While IObservable<T> is core to Rx, it doesn't tie you to using Rx exclusively. You can implement IObservable<T> without using Rx libraries, similar to how IEnumerable<T> doesn't require LINQ.\n\n3. Powerful compositional capabilities: Exposing IObservable<T> allows consumers to leverage the full power of Rx operators, enabling complex stream transformations and combinations without modifying the original components.\n\n4. Future-proofing: If the implementation needs to change in the future, the interface remains stable, reducing the impact on consuming code.\n\n5. Ecosystem compatibility: Many libraries and tools in the .NET ecosystem work with IObservable<T>, providing better interoperability.\n\nWhile the custom publisher/subscriber approach (option A) offers some benefits like implementation flexibility, it requires more work to integrate with Rx when needed and doesn't provide the out-of-the-box composability that IObservable<T> offers.\n\nThe hybrid approach (option C) adds unnecessary complexity without significant benefits, and the traditional event-based approach (option D) lacks the powerful stream processing capabilities required for this scenario.\n\nBy choosing to expose IObservable<T>, the team gains the advantages of a standard interface, the power of Rx when needed, and the flexibility to change implementations without affecting the public API, making it the most suitable choice for long-term maintainability and flexibility in this data processing scenario."}, "80": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/12", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/344891", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/43594/"], "docs_id": 344891, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Nautilus** use to have the label for the file system in it's tree as \"**File System**\".

So I'd like to hear some opinions. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a really interesting question, and upon Googling, I found out that there has been much debate on whether the breath one exhales in a temperate climate is referred to as a 'steamy breath' or simply just, 'breath'.\n\nOf course, the reason for this occurrence is because of a scientific process is called condensation. When you exhale when it's cold outside, the water vapor in your breath condenses into lots of tiny droplets of liquid water and ice (solid water) that you can see in the air as a cloud, similar to fog.\n\nHowever, it is argued that steam is only produced when water is heated, and when we exhale, the process occurring is condensation, so is it technically correct to use the phrase 'steamy breath'?\n\nThe description of the white, cloudy gas when exhaled is simply referred to as \\- vapour:\n\n> a substance diffused or suspended in the air, especially one normally liquid or solid\n\nI think that the word 'steamy' here is used because of the similar observation is made when boiling \\- white solid gas appears. However, it is scientifically wrong to refer to it as a 'steamy' breath, as steam is,\n\n> the vapour into which water is converted when *heated*, forming a white mist of minute water droplets in the air\n\nAlthough the act of both steaming and exhaling in a cold climate both lead to similar observations, the process occurring in both scenarios are different. The 'steamy breath' can simply be referred to as 'breath', for example,\n\n> \"I can see my breath when I exhale.\"\n\nIn the case of your example, 'steamy breath' implies the fact that they have just took part in an intense activity, and are currently holding back their breath because of waiting for something to happen.\nSimilarly, another word used in the same context would be *bated breath*, meaning\n\n> the condition of waiting for something to happen; subdued breathing due to high emotion\n\n'Steamy breath' most likely originated from areas with cold climates, due to description of the white clouds and the same observation of that with boiling, that is why, 'steamy' breath."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A writer is describing a tense scene where characters are waiting anxiously in a cold environment.

The correct answer, B, is \"We waited, holding our steamy breaths.\" This phrase effectively conveys both the physical and emotional aspects of the scene:\n\n1. Physical aspect: While \"steamy breath\" is not scientifically accurate (as the documentation explains, it's actually water vapor condensing due to the cold), it's a commonly used and widely understood phrase to describe visible breath in cold conditions. It implies a cold environment without explicitly stating it.\n\n2. Emotional aspect: As mentioned in the documentation, \"steamy breath\" can imply that the characters have just taken part in an intense activity and are currently holding back their breath while waiting for something to happen. This adds to the tension of the scene.\n\nOption A (\"foggy breaths\") is less common and doesn't carry the same implication of tension. Option C (\"vaporous breaths\") is technically more accurate but lacks the emotional connotation and is not a commonly used phrase. Option D (\"bated breaths\") correctly conveys the emotional state but misses the physical aspect of the cold environment.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze language use in context, applying knowledge of both scientific accuracy and literary effectiveness.

The pressure is also a factor, if you have less than 60 psi I would not be as concerned compared to a home with 90 psi.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that the urgency of replacement depends on several factors, including water pressure, disturbance of the line, and personal risk tolerance.\n\n2. In this scenario, we have multiple risk factors:\n   - Surface corrosion is present, which some sources link to potential hose failure.\n   - The water pressure is high (85 psi), close to the mentioned 90 psi threshold where more concern is warranted.\n   - The lines are frequently disturbed due to storage access, increasing the risk of failure.\n\n3.

The initial error about an invalid backend model for a core Magento file (Catalog/Category/Flat.php) suggests missing core files. The developer's attempt to fix it by copying the file from a fresh installation temporarily resolved the first error but led to a white screen, which typically indicates a PHP fatal error.

This explains both the initially missing file and the subsequent missing class. It's a common issue in Magento when upgrades are not completed properly or when core files are accidentally modified or deleted.\n\nOption B is less likely because while misconfiguration can cause issues, it wouldn't typically result in missing core files.

This is the most appropriate course of action for several reasons:\n\n1. Water Management: A flange is crucial for proper water management in an alcove bathtub installation, especially when it will be primarily used as a shower. The flange helps direct water back into the tub rather than allowing it to seep behind the tub and into the wall cavity.\n\n2.

Which combination of changes would most effectively resolve the issues in the given script while adhering to shell scripting best practices?\n\nA) Add quotes around variables and remove spaces in assignment, but keep the uninitialized EXISTING_SUM_CHECK variable\nB) Initialize EXISTING_SUM_CHECK, add quotes around variables, and remove spaces in assignment\nC) Only remove spaces in the assignment statement, as quoting variables is unnecessary for numeric comparisons\nD) Replace the if statement with a case statement to avoid variable comparison issues altogether\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple issues in the provided script and application of shell scripting best practices. The correct answer, B, addresses all the main problems:\n\n1. Quoting variables: `\"$latest_sum_check\" != \"$EXISTING_SUM_CHECK\"` prevents errors when variables are empty or contain spaces.\n2. Removing spaces in assignment: `EXISTING_SUM_CHECK=$latest_sum_check` is the correct syntax for variable assignment in shell scripts.\n3. Initializing EXISTING_SUM_CHECK: This prevents the unary operator error when the variable is first used.\n\nOption A is incomplete as it doesn't address the uninitialized variable issue. Option C is incorrect because quoting variables is crucial, even for numeric comparisons, to handle empty values. Option D proposes an unnecessary and complex solution that doesn't address the root causes.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to identify multiple issues in shell scripting, understand their implications, and apply best practices to resolve them effectively."}}
