Is it that the treatment was actually effective in the group of patients we analyzed? Some deeper inference?\"\n\nI think you are confusing the terms of art with the discussion. One of the challenges of talking about things in multiple paradigms is that the different paradigms may use the same words to define different things, or they may not directly discuss something that is of critical importance to one paradigm, but not the other. Both Frequentists and Bayesians, for example, have a concept called an \"expectation,\" but they both define it in a manner that is nonsensical in the other paradigm.\n\nI think this is what is happening here. Sampling statistics have to concern themselves with the \"population,\" precisely because they work in the sample space. It isn't that a Bayesian does not care, it is that it doesn't impact their calculation on anything as directly.\n\nA second problem is that Bayesian statistics isn't one field as there are multiple axiomatic structures you could use. How you discuss reality may change if you use de Finetti's axioms instead of Cox's. It also could depend upon whether you are an objectivist Bayesian who believes as Frequentists do that population parameters are fixed points, but whose location is unknown, versus subjectivist Bayesians who believe that the population parameter is a distribution that nature draws from and not a fixed point.\n\nSomeone like Jaynes, who uses Cox's postulates, would create hypothesis in terms of logical assertions. For example, hypothesis one could be that a drug is non\\-harmful. Hypothesis two would be that it is harmful. Implicitly, this is a universal statement and hence a population statement. The population is never mentioned.\n\nBoth methods depend upon the sample for inference, but a Bayesian can have an infinite number of hypothesis. It is more important for a Bayesian to be clear in what they are asserting and why.\n\nThere is one other difference that is important. When you use a Frequentist method you are concerned with the sampling distribution of the statistic and not the sampling distribution of the data. Infinitely many distributions will have a population mean and they will all use either a t\\-test or z\\-test. The Bayesian is concerned with the sampling distribution of the data, but not the parameters. \n\nConsider a set of independent events that map to a probability over the set \\[0,1] in $d$ dimensions. It will be approximately multivariate normal as the sample size becomes large enough. Now let us assume that although the events are independent, the components that make up the dimensions are not. They are part of a system. Let us also assume they share a common variance, $\\\\sigma^2\\_i\\=\\\\sigma^2\\_j,\\\\forall{i,j}\\\\in{D}$, and that information about any one mean exists in the other means. \n\nThe Bayesian posterior for the set $\\\\mu\\_i,i\\\\in{1\\\\dots{d}}$ for independent dimensions with independent variances and no shared information on the means would look very different from one where you assume a common variance $\\\\sigma^2$ and shared information. The Frequentist tests would be no different but the Bayesian posteriors would be.\n\nBayesian methods are concerned about the population through the likelihood function because it models how the data is generated in the first place in nature. That is why Bayesian model selection methods are so important, because you may not know the true model in nature that the population uses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Bayesian statistics, how does the concept of population parameters differ from frequentist statistics, and how does this impact the approach to inference?\n\nA) Bayesians don't consider population parameters at all, while frequentists focus solely on population parameters.\n\nB) Bayesians and frequentists treat population parameters identically, with no difference in their approach to inference.\n\nC) Bayesians view population parameters as fixed points with unknown locations, while frequentists always treat them as distributions.\n\nD) Bayesians may view population parameters as distributions or fixed points depending on their philosophical approach, while frequentists always treat them as fixed points with unknown locations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The key difference lies in how Bayesians and frequentists conceptualize population parameters:\n\n- Frequentists always treat population parameters as fixed, unknown values.\n- Bayesians have different schools of thought:\n  1. Objectivist Bayesians align with frequentists in viewing population parameters as fixed points with unknown locations.\n  2. Subjectivist Bayesians consider population parameters as distributions from which nature draws, rather than fixed points.\n\nThis fundamental difference impacts their approach to inference:\n- Frequentists focus on the sampling distribution of statistics.\n- Bayesians concentrate on the sampling distribution of the data and use likelihood functions to model how data is generated in nature.\n- Bayesian methods can incorporate prior information and update beliefs, leading to potentially different posterior distributions based on model assumptions.\n\nThe question highlights the nuanced differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, emphasizing that Bayesian statistics is not a monolithic field and can vary based on philosophical underpinnings and axiom choices."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/15", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/33919", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10343/"], "docs_id": 33919, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Could you please help me about calculating the voltage on the 100 ohm resistor.

Also, I haven't found any precise information on this subject on this site.\n\nIf hash performance is bad, I can imagine the following things which may influence the overall performance of the array construct:\n\n1. Total length of cs name\n2. Length of a \"constant\" prefix before the \"significant part\" (i.e. the encoding of `<key>`).\n3.

Still the numbers are basically reproducible on repetition.)\n\nThe first (maybe surprising) result is that this amount of variation alone creates a huge difference in overall performance, with a difference of up to a factor **4** in running time. If it was possible to discount the fixed amount of additional processing (I used a counter assignment to access the array value), the difference would probably be much, much larger!\n\nNow I heard that hash performance is particularly bad for sequences of digits, so `\\number` is possibly not a good idea for encoding the array access key.\n\n[Bruno Le Floch gave a comment](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/147966/how-to-implement-low-level-arrays-in-tex#comment336000_147966) in which he describes how to optimize number representation for hashing. This is implemented in the macro `\\hashnumber` and tested by the test cases `testhash19` to `testhash24`. The results:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testhash19\"; size 100000; prefix \"pre\";\npostfix \"\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m2.395s\nuser    0m2.280s\nsys 0m0.052s\n\nstarting test \"testhash20\"; size 100000; prefix \"\";\npostfix \"post\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m2.483s\nuser    0m2.260s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\nstarting test \"testhash21\"; size 100000; prefix \"verylongprefixtostresshashtabl\ne\"; postfix \"\"; coding \\hashnumber) )\nreal    0m4.173s\nuser    0m3.740s\nsys 0m0.056s\n\n```\n\n\\[snip]\n\nThis gives a significantly better result than when using `\\number`:\n\n* The best performance is almost double that of `\\number` (so **8** times better than the worst for `\\number`).\n* The \"spread out\" of performances between different cs name constructions is almost negligible; *even the worst performance for `\\hashnumber` is better than the best performance for `\\number`*.\n\nOf course, I'm intrigued how far this could still be enhanced by choosing a more clever encoding, but I have no clue how to go about this systematically.\n\nIn the hope to \"spread out\" hash keys for encoded numbers a bit more I made an encoding function myself (`\\mynumcode`; see test suite above). It will use a lot of different characters, produce different key lengths and avoid repetitions, which hopefully leads to a better distribution of hash keys. \n\nUsing this encoding, I get the following running times:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testhash25\"; size 100000; prefix \"pre\";\npostfix \"\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m2.194s\nuser    0m1.920s\nsys 0m0.016s\n\nstarting test \"testhash26\"; size 100000; prefix \"\";\npostfix \"post\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m2.089s\nuser    0m2.020s\nsys 0m0.040s\n\nstarting test \"testhash27\"; size 100000; prefix \"verylongprefixtostresshashtabl\ne\"; postfix \"\"; coding \\mynumcode) )\nreal    0m3.594s\nuser    0m3.008s\nsys 0m0.036s\n\n```\n\n\\[snip]\n\nYou see that the timing results are slightly better than for `\\hashnumber`, but not significantly so. So probably this is getting near optimal (for the hashing implementation of the TeX engine).\n\nAs the tests reported above are as near to testing the \"raw performance\" of the hash mechanism as conceivably possible (just storing and retrieving values; loading no additional macros and avoiding all computation), I dare to conclude the following:\n\n1. On the whole, storing array elements as separate macros with constructed cs names is feasible. Compared to the usual runtimes of TeX documents, the best given \"raw\" times for storing 100000 array elements and retrieving random elements for 1000000 times are OK and are probably completely dwarfed by any way in which these 1000000 values are processed further by the TeX system in a real application.\n2. Indeed, using `\\number` to encode a numeric key is not optimal for array performance.\n3. The solution given by Bruno Le Floch for achieving a \"hash\\-optimised\" number encoding assures a significantly better hash performance at small computational cost (see also below).\n4. The total length of the cs name doesn't seem to be significant.\n5. When using `\\number`, inexplicably the overall performance of the array implementation is almost directly inversely proportional to the \"static\" prefix in front of the array access key (much less so for any other number encoding).\n\nComparison of engines\n---------------------\n\nThe test results cited above are with the original TeX engine. I ran the test suite shown above also with other engines.\n\n* `pdftex` gives slightly less performance overall, but really insignificant.\n* `xetex` also gives slightly less performance overall, looking a little more significant (up to **1\\.5** times slower).\n\nWith `luatex` the performance differences are a bit more subtle: cases which are fast with TeX are sometimes significantly slower (up to **2** times slower), while cases where TeX is slow are getting faster, so it seems LuaTeX is better at dealing with those cases (long static prefix) where the original engine is bad.\n\nDoes everything get slower?\n---------------------------\n\nOne more concern about using the internal hash table to store arrays as thousands of cs names is that it will slow down **all** processing due to\n\n1. the fact that the size of the hash table has to be extended for really huge amounts of data, so looking up *any* cs name will take more time;\n2. the fact that the generated cs names \"clutter up\" the hash table, leading to hash conflicts for regular macro names as well.\n\nI tested this by generating the above test suite with setting `\\def\\experimentsize{1000000}` and using the following test file:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n%\\input{testhash1-setup}\n%\\input{testhash25-setup}\n\n\\usepackage{pgfplots}\n\n\\let\\rmdefault\\sfdefault\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\newcommand\\test[1]\n{%\n[can't repeat the example code here because of post length limit]\n}\n\n\\test{1}\n\n\\test{2}\n\n\\test{3}\n\n\\test{4}\n\n\\test{5}\n\n\\test{6}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThe XKCD plot example is taken from [this answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/74881/12850). The intention for using a TikZ example is that TikZ loads a real lot of source code, defining and using heaps of macros, so if anything is wrong with hash performance for normal macro processing, this is one application where it should get most observable.\n\nNote that the `\\input` statements (commented out above) are executed `before` loading `pgfplots`, to maximise potential hash conflicts when loading TikZ.\n\nI had to extend the internal tables as follows to compile the example file with one of the `\\input` statements uncommented:\n\n```\nexport hash_extra=1500000\nexport max_strings=2000000\nexport pool_size=30000000\n\n```\n\nFirst, let's look at the effect of the larger hash table. If I compile the example *with both `\\input` statements commented out* with `time pdflatex` without any extension, I get the following result:\n\n```\nreal    0m3.686s\nuser    0m3.628s\nsys 0m0.044s\n\n```\n\nWith the abovementioned extensions in place, I get\n\n```\nreal    0m3.746s\nuser    0m3.684s\nsys 0m0.052s\n\n```\n\nI would say this is a noticeable (also reproducible) slowdown, but totally insignificant for practical purposes.\n\nNow, the timing result with `\\input{testhash1-setup}` uncommented:\n\n```\nreal    0m19.760s\nuser    0m19.585s\nsys 0m0.140s\n\n```\n\nand with `\\input{testhash25-setup}` uncommented:\n\n```\nreal    0m10.710s\nuser    0m10.585s\nsys 0m0.104s\n\n```\n\nAnd here are the timing results for \"only\" processing `testhash1-setup` with the following test file:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\input{testhash1-setup}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n(Note there will be a small overhead due to starting up LaTeX twice.)\n\n```\nreal    0m15.401s\nuser    0m15.297s\nsys 0m0.084s\n\n```\n\nAnd for `testhash25-setup`:\n\n```\nreal    0m4.218s\nuser    0m4.104s\nsys 0m0.104s\n\n```\n\nSumming the run times of the separate computations and comparing with the joint computation, I get\n\n* For `testhash1-setup`, the sum of both \"separate\" computation times (`usr` timing) is *18\\.981s*, while the joint computation takes *19\\.585s*.\n* For `testhash25-setup`, the sum of both \"separate\" computation times is *7\\.788s*, while the joint computation takes *10\\.585s*.\n\nInterestingly, this means that when the array key is encoded with `\\number`, the following computation is not slowed down significantly, while when using my faster encoding method, **the slowdown is on the order of the original running time of the TikZ example**!\n\nSo this example actually allows to observe the effect of hash table cluttering: As my encoding tries to spread the hash codes for array elements across the whole hash table, the number of hash conflicts for regular macro names increases and indeed **the performance is halved**.\n\nThe results are comparable for the encoding by Bruno Le Floch.\n\nNote however that the experiment setting is really not very realistic, because loading the array code *before* TikZ comes down to setting up data structures before defining the actual document macros, while usually it will be the other way round: First, macro packages and suchlike are loaded and later during document processing, data is stored in arrays which are defined on the fly.\n\nSo what happens when I move the `\\input{testhash25-setup}` *after* the `\\usepackage{pgfplots}`?\n\n```\nreal    0m8.928s\nuser    0m8.809s\nsys 0m0.100s\n\n```\n\nSo the slowdown is still noticeable, but much less than when executing the other way round.\n\nHence, my conclusions from these experiments are:\n\n1. Extending the internal hash table alone doesn't slow TeX down.\n2. Cluttering up the hash table with macros for array elements *does* slow TeX down noticeably.\n3. It makes a difference when macros are defined; the basic packages should come first and the definition of array elements should come as late as possible.\n4. When deciding how to encode array indices, all effects should be taken into account. It makes no sense to trade slightly better hash performance for vastly slower overall run time.\n\nWe haven't even talked about arrays yet...\n------------------------------------------\n\nIndeed, so far all tests were at the \"raw hash\" level, just executing the pre\\-expanded store and retrieval commands. In a realistic application setting, of course the encoding of array keys has to take place at execution time.\n\nThat's the purpose of the macro `\\mkarrayexperiment` in the test suite above: it will generate a test file containing statements like \n\n```\n\\numhashstore{foo}{1}{1}\n\\mycount \\numhashretrieve{foo}{438549}\\relax \n\n```\n\nstoring and retrieving values to/from an array `foo` with the access macros defined above.\n\nFrom the given test suite, I get the following results:\n\n```\nstarting test \"testnumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"numhasharr\nay\" (./numhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m5.472s\nuser    0m5.192s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\nstarting test \"testhashnumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"hashnu\nmhasharray\" (./hashnumhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m3.754s\nuser    0m3.664s\nsys 0m0.032s\n\nstarting test \"testcodenumhasharray\"; size 100000; array implementation \"codenu\nmhasharray\" (./codenumhasharray.tex)) )\nreal    0m5.114s\nuser    0m4.868s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\n```\n\nHere, we can see that the effort for encoding the array keys diminishes the distance between using `\\number` and the hash\\-optimized approach of Bruno Le Floch. My own encoding is disqualified because the effort for generating the array keys outweighs the added hash efficience :\\-(\n\nBut the good new is that even taking the time needed for encoding into account, the approach of Bruno Le Floch beats the array index based on `\\number`.\n\nAre there other approaches?\n---------------------------\n\nI'm interested to hear whether there are other approaches to implementing an array apart from the hash\\-based one studied here which have comparable performance.\n\nThe `l3prop` package offers an implementation of \"property lists\" which could be accessed like arrays. But with a test similar to the above, I got a performance which is totally incomparable to the hash\\-based implementation (100 times slower for 1000 array entries and 10000 retrievals; might even get worse for larger array sizes). So this doesn't seem to be an alternative for storing huge amounts of data.\n\nI tried to devise a simple macro\\-based solution where all entries are stored in a single macro expansion, but unfortunately I couldn't think of any way for retrieving the value of an array entry with any kind of efficiency (I thought delimited arguments could be used for that, but couldn't figure out how).\n\nBut let me speculate a little: Let's talk about *n* array entries with a total content length of *m*. Conceivably, *m\\>\\>n*.\n\nThen all solutions for storing the *n* entries I can imagine fall into two categories:\n\n1. New cs names on the order of *n* are created. This is the solution sketched above, but also, for instance, all kinds of dictionary implementations where nodes of a tree are stored as single macros.\n2. At least one macro whose expansion text is on the order of *m* is created.\n\nClearly, no solution based on the first approach will be more efficient than the simple implementation given above, because that one needs exactly **one** access to the internal hash table, and you can't go lower than that.\n\nBut I think that also no solution based on the second approach can be more efficient, because however you implement it, to retrieve an array element, you'll have to expand a macro whose expansion text is on the order of *m*, and that is clearly slower than a single access to the internal hash table, so there.\n\nBut maybe I'm just lacking imagination, so feel free to present a third solution, or in fact any array implementation more efficient than the simple hash\\-based one.\n\nFinal questions\n---------------\n\nBased on what I know so far, my basic question can be refined as follows:\n\n1. Looking at the actual implementation of TeXs hashing algorithm, what is the best way to construct cs names for maximum array performance?\n2. Is there any fundamentally different method of implementing an array in TeX which gives comparable (or even better) performance than the hash\\-based one?\n3. Am I somehow looking into the wrong direction? Maybe my experiment setup is somehow fundamentally flawed and I'm getting insignificant results? Should I test differently?\n4. I used the original TeX engine for my tests, and am not using any construct specific to any TeX extension. I tested the very same code with other engines, not giving any unexpected or significantly different results. It is rather clear that LuaTeX offers to implement arrays in Lua, hence giving completely different options. Are the other engines (`pdftex`, XeTeX) offering anything which might aid in implementing arrays?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, first let me say that this is probably the most thoroughly researched question I've read so far. Congratulations.\n\nI'll be reusing some of David's comments. The hashing algorithm takes the csname as an array of bytes (probably some differences there for XeTeX and LuaTeX, let me focus on 8\\-bit engines) and computes the sum of `csname[i]*2^(len-i) % prime` where `csname[i]` denotes the `i`\\-th byte in the csname, `len` is the total number of characters, and the result is computed modulo the hash `prime`. The control sequence is then stored or retrieved at the resulting position in the hash table. If there was never any hash collision, then storage and retrieval would be easy and fast, since computing the hash is very fast (additions only). When there is a collision, TeX must check whether the command that it found in the hash table is indeed the csname that was searched for: this is done by comparing strings one character at a time, and is somewhat slower than the hashing algorithm (*I think*). TeX may need to compare all csnames with the same hash (it can stop once it finds the csname it was looking for).\n\nWhen comparing strings which happen to be different but have the same hash, TeX goes through them one character at a time, and can stop comparing as soon as it finds a difference: there lies the difference between a long prefix and a long suffix. In scenarios where there are many hash collisions (e.g., with `\\number`), most of the time is spent comparing strings which happen to have the same hash. If such strings differ on an early character (i.e., short prefix), then they will be recognized as different pretty fast. If they have long common prefixes, then TeX will have to scan them for a long time (until the first difference) before it can declare them distinct.\n\nWhy is `\\number` bad for hash collisions? Say that your array keys are 5\\-digit numbers. Compared to the hash of `00000`, the hash of `abcde` (where `a`, etc, stand for digits) is `16*a+8*b+4*c+2*d+e`. For instance, `98765` has the same hashcode as `00000` plus `16*9+8*8+4*7+2*6+5=253`. This is tiny. In fact, hash codes for all sets of five digits all lie among 280 possible values! A typical hash value corresponds to more than 300 csnames, and on average TeX will have to test half of them before finding the one it wants.\n\nHow do we spread out hashes? The main culprit in having only 280 different values with `\\number` is that Knuth chose a multiplier equal to 2 only. This is justified when names are more or less random sequences of letters of varying length, as in typical TeX documents (adding one character multiplies the whole hash value by 2, so collisions between strings of different lengths are not particularly likely regardless of their internal structure). To choose my encoding, I decided to replace `16*a+8*b+4*c+2*d+e` above by `16^4 * a + 16^3 * b + 16^2 * c + 16 * d + e`. This is simply done by inserting three dummy characters between each decimal digit, turning `98765` into `9---8---7---6---5`. Why insert three rather than more? Because 16 is the smallest power of 2 greater than 10\\. Choosing 8 instead of 16 would still lead to hash collisions: the hashes of `0--0--0--0--0` and `9--9--9--9--9` are only `9*8^4+9*8^3+...+9=42129` apart, so a typical hash would correspond to two or three csnames.\n\nThe last step was simply to convert this to code:\n\n```\n\\def\\step#1{#1---\\step}\n\\def\\endstep#1\\step{}\n\\message{\\step 123 \\endstep}\n\n```\n\nHere I use a typical technique to optimize loops: define the looping macro to do what you want and call itself again (here we want `#1->#1---`), then figure out what to feed as `#1` to break the loop. This avoids any test hence is as fast as can be while supporting an arbitrary length of input. Note also that I am putting dashes after the digit (`#1---` instead of `---#1`) in an effort to put relevant stuff early in the csname.\n\nFor the specific application of inserting stuff within numbers, we might be able to do better (haven't benchmarked): numbers will not have more than 10 digits (actually 6 might be a reasonable bound, so remove `#6` through `#9`). The following should work and may be faster\n\n```\n\\def\\dashes#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9{#1---#2---#3---#4---#5---#6---#7---#8---#9---}\n\\message{\\dashes 123********}\n\n```\n\n(at least 8 stars after the number, to support numbers of arbitrary lengths between 1 and 10\\).\n\nYet another option is to use `\\romannumeral` on each digit, which reduces hash collisions because lengths vary. I don't know how this fares.\n\nOne thing is certain: csnames of the form `<prefix><varying><postfix>` of a constant length can have `256*2^(len-1)` different hashes (where `len` is the length of the varying part), and more realistically `10*2^(len-1)` hashes only. Getting `10^5` distinct hashes absolutely requires 10 varying bytes, or some variation on the length of the prefix, varying or postfix parts. In practical settings (where key encoding is taken into account, hence where it is difficult to get more than 10 different leading bytes), one needs about 15 bytes of varying material. My `\\step` approach uses 20 (or 17, depending on whether you count the trailing `---`). My `\\dashes` approach may use various numbers depending on whether it is tailored to a specific number length.\n\n---"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about implementing arrays in TeX using control sequence names (csnames) is NOT correct?\n\nA) Using \\number to encode numeric array keys leads to poor hash performance due to limited variation in hash values.\n\nB) Inserting dummy characters between digits in numeric keys, as in the \\step macro, helps spread out hash values and reduce collisions.\n\nC) The hashing algorithm in TeX is optimized for random sequences of letters, using a multiplier of 2 in its calculations.\n\nD) Varying the length of csnames is unnecessary for achieving good hash distribution when implementing arrays.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: Using \\number for numeric keys leads to poor hash distribution, with only 280 possible hash values for 5-digit numbers.\n\nB is correct: The \\step macro inserts \"---\" between digits, which helps spread out hash values by effectively multiplying each digit by a power of 16.\n\nC is correct: TeX's hashing algorithm uses a multiplier of 2, which works well for typical TeX documents with varying-length names but is suboptimal for numeric array keys.\n\nD is incorrect: Varying the length of csnames is actually beneficial for achieving good hash distribution.

However, an oscilloscope uses only two\\-dimensions to accurately depict the physical properties of a wave. Intuitively, pitch and volume seem more basic than timbre does, so I surmise that timbre must consist in those two properties.\n\n1. Does [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre) consist in those two properties?\n2. How do two\\-dimensional waveform diagrams depict three properties of sound waves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Actually I have read (although I can't find a reference) that the subjectively perceived psychological notion of pitch itself, although very nearly wholly set by the sound wave's frequencies, *is* also weakly dependent on the intensity of the sound: that is, a higher intensity sound wave does seem ever so slightly sharper (higher in subjective pitch) than one of the same frequency but lower intensity. Hopefully another answerer to this question can add some more information.\n\nActually pitch and timbre are closely related. Timbre is primarily the *harmonic mix* of the sound wave: *i.e* if you wrote out a sound wave as:\n\n$$y(t) \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(A\\_k\\\\, \\\\cos(k\\\\,\\\\omega\\_0\\\\,t) \\+ B\\_k\\\\, \\\\sin(k\\\\,\\\\omega\\_0\\\\,t)\\\\right)$$\n\nthen, *approximately* we can make the following equations between physical properties of the sound waves (on the left) and subjective qualities of the sound perception experience (on the right):\n\n$$\\\\begin{array}{llcl}\\\\text{Fundamental frequency}\\&\\\\omega\\_0 \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"pitch\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\text{Intensity}\\& I \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(A\\_k^2\\+B\\_k^2\\\\right) \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"loudness\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\text{Relative Harmonic Mix}\\& \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{A\\_k^2\\+B\\_k^2}{I}}\\\\right)\\_{k\\=1}^\\\\infty \\& \\\\mapsto \\& \\\\text{\"Timbre\"}\\\\end{array}$$\n\nin other words, think of finding the relative amplitudes of each harmonic component and normalising them in an vector whose head lies on the unit sphere in $\\\\ell^2$. The normalised position on the unit sphere is the timbre, whilst the squared length of the unnormalised vecotr is the loudness.\n\nAS I said, the above are only approximate equations and a detailed answer would need to study the relevant psycho\\-acoustics carefully. Some interesting bits of trivia I've picked up as a singer and also learning to tune pianos:\n\n1. For many instruments \\- the piano's effervescent timbre is a good example \\- timbre has a great deal to do with nonlinear phenomenon of [*intermodulation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation), whereby sum and different frequencies produce significant components of the wave at frequencies that are away from the lowest frequency in a chord, so the Fourier series actually has a very low fundamental frequencies but only closely spaced, high harmonic number \"clusters\" of them around the harmonics of the perceived fundamental frequency are present;\n2. Modern pianos are NOT tuned to harmonics in a Fourier series, the are tuned to [equal temperament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), an invention mainly of J. S. Bach, whereby *every* semitone interval on the piano has the same frequency ratio, namely $2^{\\\\frac{1}{12}} $ so that, on a logarithmic frequency scale, the semitones are evenly spaced. The motivation is that frequency relationships between notes in a melody, chord and so forth are *then covariant with respect to any modulation (change of diatonic key)* in the music. This allows each key to be equally well in tune, which was the motivation for J.S.Bach's (or F. Chopin's) 24 preludes, each a variation on the same theme in each of the 12 diatonic keys in major and minor modes. They were, so to speak, \"showing off\" the possibilites openned up by realising, through equal temperament, the covariance of geometry of any musical pattern with respect to modulation. In contrast, flutes and clarinets, or any wind instrument that uses harmonics to realise several registers, are constrained by the instrument's physics to have the same fingering in different registers (*e.g.* $C\\_0$ and $G\\_1$ on a b\\-flat clarinet) *harmonically related*; most often a register jump corresponds to a tripling of frequency (corresponding to the first two harmonics of an open pipe). Therefore, not all instruments can play in all keys equally well. An upshot of all this is that it is certain that our subjective sense of pitch would be rather different from, say, Bach's contemporary Vivaldi, as we have learnt to ignore the \"out of tunehood\" of well tempered tuned notes (difference between them and those produced by a harmonic series);\n3. When chords are played with notes repeated at the harmonics, it becomes highly subjectives as to what is pitch and what is timbre and how accustomed the listener's ear's is to various instruments and their harmonic content weighs on the perceived pitches are in the chord. Experience with different instruments will cause the listener to group harmonics together as a single note differently, depending on what \"timbre\" is present in that instrument;\n4. In extreme cases, pitch and timbre become irresolvably tangled, as it does with in very big chords with equal spacings between them. If you play a dimished seventh chord or augmented chord (equal spacings of a minor and major third, respectively) spanning *many* octaves (you have to do this with a computer using something like Sibelius) and make an \"upwards\" or \"downwards\" progression by the equal step in the chord, it becomes about a 50% chance whether a listener will perceive the progression as upwards or downwards (this is because, if the series were truly infinite, there would be no difference in the change). I have a similar experience listening carefully to the bass line (left hand) in the third movement of Chopin's piano sonata \\#2 (Op 35\\): if you look at the score you see why: the notes in successive chords line up in endlessly rising \"stripes\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the relationship between physical properties of sound waves and their audible qualities is most accurate?\n\nA) Pitch is solely determined by the fundamental frequency of a sound wave, while timbre is entirely independent of frequency components.\n\nB) Loudness is directly proportional to the sum of squared amplitudes of all harmonic components, and timbre is unaffected by the relative strengths of these components.\n\nC) Timbre is primarily determined by the relative harmonic mix of a sound wave, while pitch can be slightly influenced by the intensity of the sound.\n\nD) The perception of pitch, loudness, and timbre can be perfectly mapped to distinct physical properties of a sound wave without any overlap or interdependence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complex relationship between physical properties of sound waves and their audible qualities.

It uses printf to format the output, cat to read file2, and cut to extract the first two words from file1. It handles multiline input correctly and places the appended words on the same line.\nC) This paste command would put the extracted words on a new line, not at the end of the last line of file2.\nD) This awk command is overly complex for the task and would append the words to every line of file2, not just the last line.\n\nOption B provides the most reliable and straightforward solution to the given problem, matching the expected output described in the original question."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/09/15", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/63902559", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/8321222/"], "docs_id": 63902559, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The following code works fine:\n\n```\ndirection.route(\n{\n     start: '30 Baker St, Old City, YY 12345',\n     end: '30 Bogus Address Ave, Fake, ZZ 12345',\n     waypoints: [ \"<address1>\", \"<address2>\" ] //Array using literals\n\n});\n\n```\n\nThe problem I'm having is that I may have dozens of addresses stored in an array.

I have used it before without enforcing the foreign key that goes to multiple different tables. I had to take care of all the relationships in code. Generally it's considered a bad idea.\n\nThe \"right\" way is to have a `CardLocation`, `PhotographLocation`, etc. tables each with its own Guid primary key (e.g. `CardLocationId`). If you happen to need to hang common data off each relationship, then you create another table called `LocationRelationship` and you make the primary key of the relationship tables (e.g. `CardLocationId`) also a foreign key that references the `LocationRelationshipId`. So, each record in `CardLocation` has a corresponding record in `LocationRelationship`. That way you can enforce all the relationships in the relational database. Unfortunately it's a lot more complicated.\n\nEdit\n----\n\nAfter thinking a bit more, the other way to do it is to have `Card`, `Photograph`, etc., all derive from a common base (let's call it `Locatable`). So you create a new table called `Locatable` with primary key `LocatableId`. Then `CardId` is both a primary key and should also be a foreign key that references `LocatableId`, and `PhotographId` is a foreign key to `LocatableId` as well. Then you just have one many\\-to\\-many table called `LocatableLocation` with foreign keys to `LocatableId` and `LocationId`.\n\nThat's fewer tables and seems to imply the intent better."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A database designer is working on a system that needs to link multiple entity types (Cards, Photographs, Illustrations, Vectors) to Locations in a many-to-many relationship.

This approach, known as the \"Shared Primary Key\" or \"Class Table Inheritance\" pattern, allows for a flexible and maintainable database design that supports multiple entity types in a many-to-many relationship with locations.\n\nOption A is not recommended as it doesn't properly enforce relationships and can lead to data integrity issues.

This explains why the feature suddenly stopped working after a seemingly unrelated event (a tab crash). The user's troubleshooting steps, including system restore and reinstalling Microsoft Live Essentials, did not resolve the issue because the feature had been discontinued on Microsoft's end. This situation highlights how software companies may sometimes remove features or change functionality without clear communication to users, leading to confusion and unnecessary troubleshooting efforts."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/11/12", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1018550", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/58572/"], "docs_id": 1018550, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Given $X$ a projective smooth curve of genus $g$, let's $Sec\\_{d/2}(X)$ be the secant variety defined as the union of $Span(D)$, with $D$ that varies among all the divisor of degree $d/2$.\nIs it true that $dim(Sec\\_{d/2})$ is less or equal to $d$?

The documentation shows that the dimension of Sec_{d/2}(X) is less than or equal to d. This is proven by considering two cases:\n\n1. When the general point of the symmetric product \u03a3^(d/2)X corresponds to d/2 projectively independent points, the dimension of Sec_{d/2}(X) is at most d-1.\n\n2. When the general point corresponds to a divisor whose span has dimension k < d/2-1, the dimension of Sec_{d/2}(X) is at most d/2 + k, which is even smaller than d.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the dimension is less than or equal to d. The inequality is sharp because there could be cases where the dimension reaches d, depending on the specific curve and the value of d.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the dimension is not always exactly d.\nOption B is too strong, as it doesn't allow for the possibility of the dimension being equal to d in some cases.\nOption D is clearly wrong, as the proof shows the dimension is always less than or equal to d, never greater."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/11", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/108083", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/28751/"], "docs_id": 108083, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When using `siunitx`, is there an intuitive way to type angular frequencies with the prefix `2\\pi \\times`?

The stack trace shows that the crash occurred in the n_tty_read function, which is part of the kernel's TTY (terminal) subsystem. Given that this happened with a telnet process and led to repeated \"tty_release_dev: pts0: read/write wait queue active!\" messages, it strongly suggests a bug in the kernel's TTY handling code. \n\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS is an older version of Ubuntu, and such kernel bugs are not uncommon, especially in long-term support releases that may not receive all the latest patches.

Specifically, it recommends using a Standard Deviation stretch with values between 2 and 3.5, depending on the type of terrain being visualized. This technique helps to enhance the contrast and detail in the imagery, making it more visually appealing and realistic.\n\nOption A (adding random noise) might introduce unwanted artifacts and is not a standard practice for improving satellite imagery.\n\nOption C (using different overlay textures) could potentially improve realism but is not mentioned as a primary technique in the given answer.\n\nOption D (increasing resolution) might help in some cases, but it's not always possible or practical, and the answer focuses on improving the existing imagery rather than obtaining higher resolution data.\n\nThe correct answer, B, directly addresses the issue of raw satellite images appearing less visually appealing and provides a specific, industry-tested method for improvement."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/09/18", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/986273", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 986273, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two machines running on Ubuntu 18\\.04 with Docker version 18\\.09\\.9 installed on them.

If it fails to resolve using mdns, host resolution will fail \\- this is usually by design, to ensure that resolution is sure to use avahi, the fact that youve got `resolve [!UNAVAIL=return]` after this, means that the systemd resolver may be configured too... `[!UNAVAILBLE=return]` means that systemd\\-resolved will always be used if its up, but continue to nss\\-dns if not.

One thing that confuses me is transistor configuration with common terminals. Since transistor has three terminals then we must use one terminal as common for both input and output actions.\n\nBut when looking at some of the circuit schemes for common collector I can't see clearly how collector is common for both input and output circuit? Take this scheme for example (taken from: [allaboutcircuits.com](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-collector-amplifier/)):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4RBE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4RBE.png)\n\nI don't understand how is collector common here and not emitter? As far as I can see the emitter is part of both input and output loops. How is this collector common?\n\nOn the same page they explain it like this:\n\n> It is called the common\\-collector configuration because (ignoring the power supply battery) both the signal source and the load share the collector lead as a common connection point as in Figure below.\n> \n> \n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgSXq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgSXq.png)\n> \n> \n> Common collector: Input is applied to base and collector. Output is from emitter\\-collector circuit.\n\nBut I still don't understand it.\nWhat I see from this scheme is that the input loop is (according to Kirchhoff loop law): V\\_in \\- V\\_BE \\- V\\_load \\= 0 and output loop is: V\\_cc \\- V\\_load \\- V\\_EC \\= 0\\. So the common for both loops is V\\_load that belongs to emitter terminal and not to collector's.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A BJT transistor has three terminals, namely Base(B), Emitter(E), and Collector(C). But we need actually four terminals to connect the transistor to the rest of the circuit. So we need two terminals for the input and two terminals for the output. In a common collector configuration, which is also known as emitter follower, the collector terminal is shared between the input and output signals, as shown in your schematic. If you AC ground the collector, i.e. short out the DC battery source, you would end up with the collector standing as the common terminal for both input and output signals. \n\nThe purpose of common collector is to buffer an **AC input signal, not DC signal**. Also note that a BJT is mostly used for amplification. So the name has something do with AC signals. A DC input signal, however, is just used for biasing the transistor. So it has no other purposes. Therefore, the name **common collector** comes after we AC ground all signals present in the circuit. If you AC ground the input signal, which is an AC signal, such as voice, plus a DC bias voltage, you would end up with the AC signal itself, the DC bias part would be shorted. The AC analysis of the battery like the DC bias voltage would be shorted. Therefore at the end you'll end up with the collector as the common terminal between the input and output signals. \n\nHere's a schematic that might better show what's going on:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGDXe.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGDXe.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a common collector (CC) configuration of a BJT transistor, why is the collector considered the common terminal for both input and output signals, despite the emitter appearing to be part of both loops in DC analysis?\n\nA) The collector is always the common terminal in all BJT configurations, regardless of the circuit design.\n\nB) The name \"common collector\" is a misnomer, and the configuration should actually be called \"common emitter.\"\n\nC) When analyzing AC signals, the DC power sources are considered AC ground, making the collector the shared point between input and output.\n\nD) The collector is common because it carries both the input and output currents simultaneously.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The common collector configuration is named based on its behavior with AC signals, not DC. When performing AC analysis, DC voltage sources (like the power supply) are treated as AC ground or short circuits. This effectively makes the collector the common point between the input signal path and the output signal path. The purpose of this configuration is primarily for AC signal buffering, not DC operation. While in DC analysis the emitter might appear to be part of both loops, it's the AC signal handling that gives this configuration its name and characteristics. This illustrates the importance of considering both AC and DC analyses to fully understand transistor circuit configurations."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/17", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260760", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1603234/"], "docs_id": 260760, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: See this revisions link, <https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/4315290/1>\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYD8j.png)\n\nthe above is just a text, when I hover mouse over the text, its behaving like a hyperlink?

This usage often occurs in casual, somewhat self-aware contexts, such as \"I got my hair cut today, hope the boyfriend likes it!\" or \"I think we're free on Friday, but I'll have to check with the boyfriend!\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the usage is not described as being specific to any particular region.

At this point you're on a local branch, `featureX`, set to track remote\\-branch `origin/featureX`, but there is no `origin/featureX` any more.\n\nIn this case, though, you have local branch `master` tracking `origin/master` when there is no `origin/master` *yet*. Once you create it (via the push that makes the repository non\\-empty), the problem will go away.

The local master branch is set to track origin/master by default, but since the remote repository is empty, this branch doesn't exist yet.

You would not fall through without working hard to make that happen.\n\nIce damage isn't at play here. [Rust always looks \"swollen\" because it is swollen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide_jacking) Damage from ice causes a split, it actually breaks the tube; [the expansive force of ice is greater than the yeild strength of steel](https://inspectapedia.com/plumbing/Force_of_Freezing_Water_Ice.php#:%7E:text=Various%20sources%20give%20different%20expansion,about%2025%2C000%20and%20114%2C000%20psi.), it doesn't bend it or bulge it because the steel isn't ductile enough to accommodate the [expansive pressures of ice](https://inspectapedia.com/plumbing/Force_of_Freezing_Water_Ice.php#:%7E:text=Various%20sources%20give%20different%20expansion,about%2025%2C000%20and%20114%2C000%20psi.) at [freezing temperatures](https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1683&t=brittleness-of-metals-at-low-temperature#:%7E:text=Even%20steel%20gets%20brittle%20and,some%20directions%20than%20in%20others.).\n\nThe welds to the other parts of the railing provide ample strength. As it is, this is still plenty strong and you couldn't break it even beating it with a sledge hammer. Steel doesn't turn to glass like others here are scared about. You don't need to panic and replace this immediately out of fear and panic, keep calm and carry on as they say. Also, this looks like surface rust to me, and rust does look like it bulges because it is an expansion in a sense... and keep in mind the very basic point that water expands in the direction of the least resistance; with a hollow section member like a post that isn't sealed, the ice is going to break and unfrozen water will be forced upwards long before the steel starts to bend.\n\nResponses to your questions:\n\n> Do I need to cut that piece out and have someone weld a repair or is it ok to leave as is?\n\nYour choice, and no there is nothing mandating that you replace.\n\n> Should I put rust stop on it?\n\nYour choice, but typical refinishing will be sufficient; stopping water getting/staying in is going to determine the fate of whether it continues to rust (this doesn't look like you salt so that's not a concern).\n\n> Since it's hollow should I seal the gaps in the cap above to prevent water getting in or does it need the ventilation to let it dry out?\n\nIt needs both *and* it needs a means for the water to drain.\n\n... so:\n\nYou have a lot of sets of options and you will need to include a choice from each set:\n\n1. deal with the existing condition: do nothing and let it live many years until the whole thing is so rotten and unsightly that you can take your years of savings and replace the whole railing with one you like better; refinish it and keep the bulge, it's fine; full replacement; or, partial replacement.\n2. deal with water that gets in: fill the post; or, provide weeping.\n3. deal with water getting in: non\\-permanent seal, caulking or plug; permanent seal, welding; or, extend the cap.\n\nNow you know:\n\n1. this is not a safety concern, and only needs to be dealt with if you decide the effort of remediating is less than how much you don't like the look.\n2. you can refinish, repair, or replace; is just a question of how easy and cheap you want to go.\n3. you are going to want to keep water from getting in and staying in, in order to prevent degradation to continue or affect a replacement in the same way.\n\nTo break down your options:\n\n* to refinish: sand, prime, and paint.\n* to fully replace: cut out the post free from the attached rails, remove the paver, cut the post so you have vertical working space, remove from the base, then replace everything if you have means to weld or hire a welder, and follow standard refinishing procedures for the given metal.\n* to partially replace: if you know how to weld, you will know how to do this. For those folks without that know\\-how: This process is along the same lines as above, but just cut out the portion of the post you don't like. The work would include grinding the welds flush before finishing.\n* note: you will need to \"tie\" into the finish on the adjacent railing components to blend old and new finish together.\n* to fill the post: grout it, using the opening at the top.\n* to provide weeping: drill a weep hole at the top of the paver and make it a big enough hole because you will want to grout it a little above the top of the paver so water that gets in doesn't pool at the bottom. Be warned, this will constantly drain rusty water over your pavers and permanently stain.\n* to non\\-permanently seal: get a color matched exterior grade sealer that can accommodate the expansion/contraction of metals in it's cured state (so not acrylic or urethane); replace as needed, you should get a few years. To plug, find some rubber and shape to fit any openings; stuff it in there so it has some gently compression.\n* to permanently seal: if you have means to weld, weld any holes shut. I'm assuming if you have means to weld you're not an idiot and understand when it's safe to weld something fully closed so you don't burst it and harm yourself; if you don't have means to weld, hire a welder to go this route.\n* to extend the cap: either weld on a down turn, or hire someone to weld a down turn on that covers any holes; or, screw something that you've bent into shape from sheet metal to turn down over any holes.\n\nAlternatively, you can take the point of view that isherwood suggested, **there's nothing wrong with that point of view**, and hire an engineering firm to come out and take x\\-rays of the crystalline structure of the post and make an empirical determination of the strength of the post to let you know if it is within your jurisdiction's threshold for lateral strength of resistance for railing safety then design a replacement and hire a certified welder and verify the strength of the welds with a special inspection.\n\n> If you want to verify, tap right there with a metal tool. It'll ring true if it's still solid, but bulged by ice. It'll sound dull and mushy if it's severely rusted. In the latter case it's in danger of breaking under the weight of a person and should be replaced ASAP.\n\nThe person who would break this would have to be one big boy, they would have to overwhelm the strength of the remaining steel, the welds from the adjacent railing components, and the strength of resistance of those components all tied together *at the same moment*. I wouldn't worry about this, but maybe you have some people in your life who can apply [hundreds of thousands of pounds of force](https://weldingweb.com/vbb/threads/28778-how-much-force-to-bend-1x1-quot-solid-steel).\n\nSome other notes:\n\n1. even sealed steel will draw in water through capillary action, don't seal it without giving a way for water to get out and also doing something to prevent pooling. Some light reading sources [here](https://www.cross-safety.org/uk/safety-information/cross-safety-report/freezing-splits-galvanised-shs-columns-253), [here](https://steeltubeinstitute.org/resources/hss-damage-due-water-infiltration-freezing/), and [here](https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-the-glass-bottle-filled-with-water-when-it-freeze-in-the-freezer-Will-the-bottle-crack#:%7E:text=When%20water%20%E2%80%9Cfreezes%E2%80%9D%20it%20expands.&text=When%20water%20%E2%80%9Cfreezes%E2%80%9D%20it%20expands,of%20the%20expanding%20freezing%20water.)

That steel decking is getting some rust, nothing to be worried about, but that is the structural part of your balcony so it is worth keeping an eye on and tracking. You may want to give some thought about the idea of replacing the sealant/grout between your pavers if it gets worse; but, this could just be from the cut ends of the decking corroding back when concrete was first poured or it could just be from water getting on the edge. Certainly nothing to lose sleep over.\n3. with your latest edit, you note the ceiling below is deteriorating; that is going to be from the lack of a drip edge and water rolling down the face and back underneath, soaking that edge year after year and getting sucked in between the finish and the base material, slowing separating the two."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner notices rust and swelling on a metal porch railing post.

Policy Admin stores all the information about insurance policies and the clients. The client would be an organization, school, city, county, etc. Some pieces that are tracked are the policy header information, the classes, the different lines of business under the class (For a Life policy, you could have Supplemental Life, Spouse Life, Dependent Life, etc.), how volumes are calculated, rates, eligibility information, etc.\n\nA good representation of our current object model is the following.

It uses the option to calculate and store the volume on the coverage election. \n\nData model in census entry would be\n\n```\nClient\n  Employee\n    Coverage Elections\n\n```\n\nIt seems I would have two bounded contexts here.

CloudFlare on the free plan can't do port translation. If you make a request on port 80, CloudFlare will send it to your origin on port 80\\. CloudFlare is essentially invisible. On the enterprise plan CloudFlare may be able to do this for you.\n\nIf your server is on port 8080 you should install a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). This can be on the same server as the application server, or on a different server. On a different server, with appropriate firewall rules, you can make a [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)), which increases security.\n\nNginx is very commonly used as a reverse proxy, either on the same server as your app server or a different server. Nginx can easily accept requests on port 80 then pass them on to an app server running on port 80\\. It's very lightweight, requiring very little CPU or RAM.\n\nNginx can also cache pages, based on rules you define, to accelerate serving static resources or anonymous pages. Serving a page from a cache takes much less work than generating the page again. Nginx reverse proxy [guide here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/). I also have an [Nginx/Wordpress guide](https://www.photographerstechsupport.com/tutorials/hosting-wordpress-on-aws-tutorial-pt1-introduction-configuration-downloads/#wpmu-nginx-configuration-files) that will give you some more examples on how to cache pages for anonymous users, but not logged in users.\n\n**Update based on comments**\n\nApparently on Linux you can use iptables to redirect ports. So for example a server running on port 8080 can respond on port 80\\. This would have to be set up by a user who as root privileges, as non\\-privileged users can't listen to ports below 1024\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is setting up a web server on a Linux system and needs to make an application running on port 8080 accessible via the standard HTTP port 80.

The CloudFlare free plan does not support port translation. This functionality is only available on their enterprise plan.\n\nB) Incorrect. Modifying the application code to listen on port 80 would require root privileges, as non-privileged users can't listen on ports below 1024. This approach could introduce security risks.\n\nC) Correct. Setting up an Nginx reverse proxy is a common and secure method to forward requests from port 80 to an application running on port 8080. Nginx is lightweight, can be configured to cache pages, and can be set up on the same server or a separate server for increased security.\n\nD) While iptables can be used to redirect ports on Linux, this approach requires root privileges and may not provide the additional benefits of a reverse proxy such as caching and increased security through a potential DMZ setup."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/12", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/221523", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/55168/"], "docs_id": 221523, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I installed stand\\-alon Hyper\\-V server and create 2 guest system.

This method allows the administrator to easily copy the required drivers to the appropriate location within the guest's file system. Option A, while possible, requires additional software.
