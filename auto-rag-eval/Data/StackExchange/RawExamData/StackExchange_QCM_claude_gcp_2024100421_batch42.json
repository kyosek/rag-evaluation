It includes the main effects of X1 and X2, which is important even when the hypothesis is only about the interaction. This follows the principle of hierarchy in regression modeling.\n\n3. It considers potential nonlinear effects of other variables (X3 and X4). This is crucial because interactions between X1 and X2 can sometimes act as proxies for main effects or nonlinear relationships of other variables.\n\n4. This comprehensive approach helps to avoid misspecification of the model and reduces the risk of finding spurious interaction effects that may be due to omitted variables or unaccounted nonlinearities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it omits main effects, which can lead to biased estimates of the interaction effect.

This spring has been there for at least as long as my 100 year old house since the house has a root cellar which used the spring water at some point to cool the room.\n\nI digress...\n\nNeedless to say the lawn on that side of my house is saturated with water. It doesn't appear to be an issue with coming into my house... yet.\n\nMy plan is to build a containment pool (15' x 20' x 2'). Fill the base with gravel, build the walls with concrete blocks, line with EPMD liner, and figure out some way to properly drain this water once the height of the pond reaches a certain point.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n1. There's very little chance of this water not coming out of the ground at this point. It has been for at least 100 years.\n2. The previous owner build a 2' deep catch basin a long time ago to solve this problem but over the years it has been defeated. He did gravel/landscape mat, then another layer of the same. It seems to have been totally filled with mud/sediment.\n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. The ground on this side of my house is basically unusable so tearing it up is not a big deal to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Several thoughts:\n\n* Make sure the pond is below the spring and use a riverbed to drain into the pond. You don't want to try to get the spring to come up in the middle of the pond.\n* Install a drain system outside of the pond liner for any water that doesn't go into the pond.\n* Make sure you have something to move the water in the pond (pump and waterfall) to avoid mosquitoes nesting. Perhaps have a small riverbed crossing below the spring area with a porous stone wall that lets spring water enter.\n* Instead of a pond, you could install a [French drain](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/2865/how-to-build-a-french-drain), using several tubes enclosed in gravel and optionally landscaping fabric. You can feed that into a [drain field](http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/health/ehoss/drainfield.html) for watering the lawn, which just has the gravel below the pipe instead of above it. Or just run it around the house to where any runoff goes away from the foundation. To avoid clogging and sediment buildup, make sure to include a clean\\-out access at the top to flush with a hose or plumbing snake or even the clog attachment on a vent cleaner.\n* One final though, instead of getting rid of the water, store it in an underground rain barrel/cistern, install a sump pump, attach a hose, and you have free water for all of your yard work."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has discovered a natural spring in their yard that has been causing water saturation issues.

This is because audio/video tracks aren't like photos that can be modified and saved immediately. They need to be \"streamed\" and recorded again. This is available in VLC in the \"Convert\" option.\n\nOnce you save the converted file and play it again it will contain both the audio files.

Option B is partially correct in that it uses the \"Convert\" option, but it results in a file with two audio tracks rather than replacing the original audio. Option D is not a valid method for exporting the modified video.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because it uses FFmpeg, a powerful command-line tool for handling multimedia files. The provided command correctly maps the video from the original file (map 0:0) and the audio from the second file (map 1:0) while copying both video and audio codecs without re-encoding.

But I can't wrap my head around the intuition of why the infinite dimensional feature map () in the gaussian kernel is not subject to problems arising in this infinite dimensional space. I know that the \"feature mapped\" vector is never directly computed, but the inner product for example is evaluated and used as a measure of similarity between vectors. \n\nBut let's assume we are working with data sampled from a hypersphere, if in higher dimensions, the data becomes subject to problems like [the concentration of measure phenomenon](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/233931/explanation-for-this-event-on-a-high-dimensional-dataset) where everything shrinks to near zero volume and sampled points becomes randomly distributed/orthogonal on average, how would a gaussian kernel benefit in this setting since it would be taking the input data and mapping it to infinite dimensional space where in theory, all points should be uniformly close together around the center of the sphere and orthogonal on average, thus providing no insight for classification/clustering? \n\nOr does the gaussian kernel map these points to a different geometrical structure in infinite dimensional Hilbert space? If so, why is this not then subject to other problems that arise due to the curse of dimensionality?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If we're taking, say, $\\\\mathcal N(0, I)$ in increasing dimensions, then sample points eventually end up uniform on the surface of a sphere. Since most directions are orthogonal in high dimensional Euclidean space, most samples end up with inner product zero.\n\nThe Gaussian feature map brings points to $\\\\phi(X)$ in the RKHS.\nIt's interesting to note that $\\\\lVert \\\\phi(x) \\\\rVert^2 \\= \\\\langle \\\\phi(x), \\\\phi(x) \\= k(x, x) \\= 1$ for any point $x$; that is, *any* point is mapped onto the surface of a sphere in the RKHS.\n\nBut are they uniform on that sphere? **No**: $$\\\\langle \\\\phi(x), \\\\phi(y) \\\\rangle \\= k(x, y) \\> 0$$ for any points $x$, $y$, but if the points were uniform, we'd expect inner products to be positive half the time and negative half the time.\n\nWe *can* choose a kernel so that points are usually approximately orthogonal to one another; just take $\\\\sigma$ really small so that $k(x, y)$ is usually almost zero. They still won't be uniform (no negative inner products) but they'll be pretty \"spread out.\" We can also get them to almost collapse in on themselves: if we take $\\\\sigma \\\\to \\\\infty$, then $$\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\phi(x), \\\\phi(y) \\\\rangle }{ \\\\lVert \\\\phi(x) \\\\rVert \\\\lVert \\\\phi(y) \\\\rVert } \\\\approx 1$$ for all $x$ and $y$.\n\nBut neither of these are very useful kernels, so we don't usually use them.

What is the most appropriate course of action in this scenario?\n\nA) Proceed with the backup using the Windows 7 Transfer tool, as system administrators should have full access to all company data.\n\nB) Refuse to perform the backup, as it's not your responsibility to handle sensitive HR information.\n\nC) Provide the HR administrator with an encrypted external disk and instructions to perform their own backup.\n\nD) Escalate the issue to upper management and let them decide how to proceed with the backup.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action is to provide the HR administrator with an encrypted external disk and instructions to perform their own backup. This solution respects the sensitive nature of HR data and the need for discretion in handling such information. It also protects the system administrator from potential accusations of data prying while still ensuring that the necessary backups are performed. This approach demonstrates respect for the HR role's authority and the importance of maintaining confidentiality in HR matters. Additionally, it aligns with the principle of least privilege, where access to sensitive information is limited to those who absolutely need it."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/09/30", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/342794", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/99863/"], "docs_id": 342794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have a process $\\\\{X\\_{t}\\\\}\\_{t\\\\geq 0}$ ,with fixed parameter $\\\\epsilon\\>0$, starting from zero that satisfies\n\n* The process is strictly monotone $X\\_{t\\+r}\\-X\\_{t}\\>0$ with moments existing $p\\\\in(\\-\\\\infty, \\\\beta)$ for some $\\\\beta\\>0$.

Is it a 20 amp, twist lock, single receptacle?\n\nWithout using force make sure the device screws are completely backed out, but don't remove them. Strip off about 1\u201d of insulation to get a good size hook. As you're bending it, stop short of a full hook to more of a \u201cU\u201d shape.

Then, strip about 1 inch of insulation and form a U-shaped hook in the wire. Place this hook under the screw and use pliers to complete the hook before tightening the screw. This method ensures a secure connection while working with the limited flexibility of thicker wires. Option A is incorrect as it may lead to an insecure connection.

quantities above 1 for configurable products, despite sufficient stock being available. What is the most likely cause of this issue based on the provided code snippets?\n\nA) The product is out of stock in the inventory\nB) The custom extension's observer is setting a hard limit of 1 item per cart\nC) The custom extension's observer is incorrectly checking available quantity\nD) There is a JavaScript error preventing quantity updates on the frontend\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause is that the custom extension's observer is incorrectly checking available quantity. In the `cartUpdate` method of the observer, there's logic that compares the requested quantity to available quantity and sets an error message if it exceeds availability. However, this logic may be flawed or not accounting for all scenarios, causing it to incorrectly limit quantities to 1.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question states that sufficient stock is available in the backend. \n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no evidence of a hard-coded limit of 1 item in the provided code.\n\nOption D is possible but less likely given the specific error message coming from the extension.\n\nThe correct approach would be to review and debug the quantity checking logic in the extension's observer, particularly in the `cartUpdate` and `productCart` methods."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/24", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/346563", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/133145/"], "docs_id": 346563, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here I am referring to class B output power amplifier.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KyNzG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KyNzG.png)\n\nThis circuit should be easy to build and understand but I'm having problems with biasing since I don't really know how to bias the bases of Q1 and Q2, so that Q1 would conduct only **positive polarity signals** and Q2 would conduct only **negative polarity signals**.\n\nIt seems that I only managed to properly bias class A amplifier, but not class B.\n\n* How would I had to bias the upper circuit to achieve class B operation of an amplifier?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a simple known circuit which works as a 'programmable zener'.\nBelow is the principle diagram:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xjl4P.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fxjl4P.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nFor a real application the variable resistor may be split in three parts to get more accurate control.

Before first time use you must make sure the variable resistor set such that the base is at the collector voltage. Thus there is minimal voltage drop. Then you turn the resistor until the bias is 'correct' which normally means you no longer see (scope) hear (ears) the distortion in the output signal.

Check your system logs; if you see something like this:\n\n```\nServer Administrator (Shared Library): Data Engine EventID: 0  A semaphore set has to be created but the system limit for the maximum number of semaphore sets has been exceeded\n\n```\n\nthen you're running out of semaphores.\n\nYou can run `ipcs -s` to list all of the semaphores currently allocated on your system and then use `ipcrm -s <id>` to remove a semaphore (if you're reasonably sure it's no longer needed). You might also want to track down the program that created them (using information from `ipcs -s -i <id>`) to make sure it's not leaking semaphores. In my experience, though, most leaks come from programs that were interrupted (by segfaults or similar) before they could run their cleanup code.\n\nIf your system really needs all of the semaphores currently allocated, you can increase the number of semaphores available. Run `sysctl -a | grep kernel.sem` to see what the current settings are. The final number is the number of semaphores available on the system (normally 128\\). Copy that line into `/etc/sysctl.conf`, change the final number to a larger value, save it, and run `sysctl -p` to load the new settings."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting issues with Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) on a Red Hat 5.1 server.

I'd like to have notes, a preview of the next slide and the time I have left for my talk displayed to me on the laptop screen, while the projector shows the regular presentation slides.\n\n**Ideally this program should work under Linux (Ubuntu 12\\.04\\).** Does such a program exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So **[pdfpc on github](https://pdfpc.github.io/)** (which is a forked and improved version of the [pdf\\-presenter\\-console](http://web.archive.org/web/20120313155207/http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/pdf_presenter_console.html)) is the closest thing I found.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nIt has all the features I looked for. Regular slides on the projector, **view of the next slide and the current one** on the laptop. It **pre\\-caches the slides** for fast switch and can provide an **overview with thumbnails** for each slide (quick selection). It also **plays videos**. With the `n` one can edit notes that are stored in a text file in the same directory as the PDF, or it can show beamer slides on the side screen.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo use, one has to invoke **pdfpc** with a PDF file like this in terminal:\n\n```\npdfpc presentation.pdf\n\n```\n\nOf course one can add it to the list of applications to open PDF's with in your file\\-manager to make it easier. There are command line options to interchange screens, set the timer, and have it count down instead of up.\n\nThe rest is straight forward and documented in the man pages. Ubuntu man\\-pages are outdated, so one should consult the [man pages on the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20181220164758/http://pdfpc.github.io:80/manpage.pdfpc.1.html). I made a request for importing LaTeX\\-Beamer notes.\n\nThe latest version (4\\.0 and up) supports LaTeX\\-Beamer notes. Just use `--notes={left,right,top,bottom}` to match the setting in your \"beamer\" document:\n\n```\n\\usepackage{pgfpages}\n\\setbeameroption{show notes}\n\\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}\n\n```\n\nWith the above, you would use `--notes=right`.\n\nInstallation / Compilation\n--------------------------\n\nFor Windows PCs it might be a pain in the rear to compile, since the requirements state:\n\n> * Vala Compiler Version \\>\\=0\\.11\\.0\n> * Gnu compiler collection\n> * CMake Version \\>\\=2\\.6\n> * Gtk\\+ 2\\.x\n> * libPoppler with glib bindings\n\nWhich is a handful to install and get running. For Ubuntu, other Debian distros and Arch, it's a piece of cake as there are packages in the repositories."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are preparing to give a presentation using LaTeX-Beamer, which outputs a PDF file.

Such posts can be retagged with more meaningful tags, even if that means creating new ones (e.g, [wix\\-dark](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wix-dark \"show questions tagged 'wix-dark'\")/[dark\\-gdk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dark-gdk \"show questions tagged 'dark-gdk'\")) as others have suggested.\n\n[light](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/light \"show questions tagged 'light'\") *seems* to have a genuine use for: 3D rendering, openGL, 2D graphics etc, so maybe only a clean\\-up would be necessary (as the tag is being used for [other](https://stackoverflow.com/q/23754965/2246344) [purposes](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22312681/2246344)).

A more specific tag for that use is [lighting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lighting \"show questions tagged 'lighting'\"). So if [light](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/light \"show questions tagged 'light'\") is used for that purpose, I would suggest to retag with [lighting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lighting \"show questions tagged 'lighting'\").\n\nTo add to it, there's also [lights](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lights \"show questions tagged 'lights'\"), which has no description, but seems to be used almost exclusively in the graphics domain. My proposal would be to declare it a synonym of [lighting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lighting \"show questions tagged 'lighting'\"). Or to get rid of it, and re\\-tag the current uses with [lighting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lighting \"show questions tagged 'lighting'\").\n\n\"Lighting\" is a widely used term in the graphics domain, and I'm not aware of any other common uses. Well, maybe in interior decorating, but that's not really on topic for SO. So it seems like a specific enough tag name, and it already has a description that matches that use."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following strategies would be most appropriate for addressing the issues with the \"light\" tag on StackOverflow, according to the discussion?\n\nA) Keep the \"light\" tag as is, since it has genuine uses for 3D rendering and OpenGL\nB) Create a new tag called \"wix-light\" to replace all instances of the \"light\" tag\nC) Retag posts using \"light\" with more specific tags like \"lighting\" for graphics-related questions\nD) Burninate the \"light\" tag entirely without replacing it\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The discussion suggests that while the \"light\" tag seems to have some legitimate uses in graphics and rendering contexts, it's being used inconsistently and for other purposes as well. The top answer proposes retagging graphics-related \"light\" questions with the more specific \"lighting\" tag, which already exists and has a clear description for that domain.

Naturally those who are more important will take more of the budget. As you increase the lambda, you are *decreasing* the budget, i.e. penalizing more.\n\nFor your plot, each line represents a coefficient whose value is going to zero as you are decreasing the budget or as you are penalizing more(increasing the lambda). To choose the best lambda, you should consult the MSE vs lambda plot. I would say though the faster a coefficient is shrinking the less important it is in prediction; e.g. I think the dotted dashed blue one should have more information than the solid black one. Try plotting a summary, a legend and an MSE vs lambda too. If you choose your best lambda and then look at your betas you can see which betas are more important by looking at their values at the optimum lambda."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In ridge regression, as the penalty parameter \u03bb (lambda) increases:\n\nA) All coefficients shrink at the same rate towards zero\nB) Coefficients with less predictive power shrink faster towards zero\nC) Coefficients with more predictive power shrink faster towards zero\nD) The overall model accuracy always improves\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is correct because ridge regression penalizes coefficients such that those that are least effective in prediction shrink fastest towards zero as \u03bb increases.

As long as the database has enough RAM for it's buffer pool I'm guessing performance should be fine, so if I go with a VPS host like Linode I can just keep upgrading my server so the database has enough RAM. My concern is what happens when I can't get more RAM, how much does performance suffer when a database doesn't have enough RAM? Should I look at the decreasing free memory available like it were a ticking time bomb? Does the DBMS change it's caching techniques to avoid disk accesses whenever possible? Essentially I want to know how smart DBMS's are and how they cope before sharding or replication is used.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Programs, in general, are exactly as smart as they are programmed. DBMSes are programs. So without knowing what DBMS you're using, it's impossible to say, in general, what will happen. So, the only correct answer to your question is a close vote as \"not a real question\" (which I note someone has already done). However, I've got some spare time, so I'll write up a general screed on database scaling and performance, in the hope it might answer the question you *should* be asking.\n\nSince you're using the not\\-really\\-hip\\-any\\-more term \"DBMS\", I'll assume you're using a not\\-really\\-hip\\-any\\-more relational database, though, and there things get more complicated. The engines I'm familiar with (MySQL and PostgreSQL) both have a zillion knobs to tell the system how much RAM to use \\-\\- caches of various things, working set memory, buffers... it's all a lot of fun. Tuning them appropriately for the workload and available system resources is mostly (though not entirely) about reducing disk I/O, since that is usually (though, again, not always) the slowest and most\\-likely\\-to\\-cause\\-a\\-bottleneck component in the physical system.\n\nThus, when you are unable to increase RAM any further, your performance will start to suffer (hopefully gradually) as more queries require more disk accesses to complete. The performance degradation with database size increase will be exacerbated by how poor the disk I/O performance is.\n\nGiven how hard it is to horizontally scale a relational database (it's not *impossible*, but it's a whole hell of a lot harder than horizontally scaling frontends), if you're intending on doing things at scale, you need a provider that can give you big machines \\-\\- lots of RAM, but also lots of CPU, disk space *and* IOPS. Linode's largest VM appears to be 20GB, which is way too small. AWS has instances with up to 70GB or so of RAM, which is better, but when you can get a physical machine with a TB (or more) of RAM... it's still not real clever. \n\nIt's not that a VM is always *wrong* for a database server, but at some point, when you outgrow the available VM options, you need to know what you're going to do next. It's increasingly common for people to go down the \"shard early, shard often\" path, because if you're going for massive scale there isn't a physical machine on earth that'll save you, and it means you can run on whatever dinky\\-toy cloud you like. Sharding is a lot of work to do right, though, and limits your options somewhat in the way you model and interact with your data, so I like to avoid it if I can. The thing is, physical hardware moves at a fairly steady clip, and there's a lot of headroom already available for you to grow into, so by the time you've got a database that needs 2TB of RAM and 30TB of storage (roughly the largest spec single physical machine I can buy at the moment), technology is likely to have improved to the point where a machine with 4TB of RAM and 100TB of storage costs *less* than what you paid for that 2TB monster.\n\n(Disclaimer: I work at a hosting provider that does a lot of hybrid VPS/physical setups on behalf of customers of various sizes, and I'm sure this colours my judgment on the subject)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is developing a database-intensive application and is concerned about scalability.

For database-intensive applications, physical hardware often provides more headroom for growth. The text recommends avoiding premature sharding due to its complexity, instead advocating for starting with a large physical machine and upgrading hardware as needed.

What does it intuitively mean? If one is to explain this to their child how would one go about it?\n\nIt's a concept that I have difficulty in articulating \\- especially when relating variance to risk. I understand it mathematically and can explain it that way too. But when explaining real world phenomena how do you make one understand variance and it's applicability in the 'real world', so to speak.\n\nLet's say we are simulating an investment in a stock using random numbers (rolling a die or using an excel sheet, doesn't matter). We get some 'return on investment' by associating each instance of the random variable to 'some change' in the return. Eg.: \n\n> Rolling a 1 implies a change of 0\\.8 per \\\\$1 in investment, a 5 a change of 1\\.1 per \\\\$1 and so on.\n\nNow if this simulation is run for about 50 times (or 20 or 100\\) we will get some values and the final value of the investment. So what does 'variance' actually tell us if we were to calculate it from the above data set? What does one \"see\" \\- If the variance turns out to be 1\\.7654 or 0\\.88765 or 5\\.2342 what does this even mean? What did/can I observe about this investment?? What conclusions can I draw \\- in lay man terms.\n\nPlease feel free to augment the question with that for standard deviation too! Although I feel it's 'easier' to understand, but something that would contribute to making it also 'intuitively' clear would be greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would probably use a similar analogy to the one I've learned to give 'laypeople' when introducing the concept of bias and variance: the dartboard analogy.

We also know that as sample size grows, the variance of this distribution gets smaller and smaller, by a factor of $n$:\n\n$$\n\\\\bar{X}\\_n \\- \\\\mu\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left(0,\\\\tfrac{\\\\sigma^2}{n}\\\\right)\n$$\n\nThe strong [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) says that *in the end* as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$ we would end up estimating $\\\\mu$ precisely \n\n$$\n\\\\Pr\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\overline{X}\\_n \\= \\\\mu \\\\right) \\= 1\n$$\n\nNotice that as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$ then $\\\\tfrac{\\\\sigma^2}{n} \\\\to 0$, so you can think of it as a normal distribution shrinking all the way down, until it reaches [Dirac delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) function with all the probability mass at $\\\\mu$ and zero probability otherwise (see the image taken from the Wikipedia article on Dirac delta). They can be seen as one being natural consequence of the other, rather then contradiction.

They describe different aspects of the same limiting behavior.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete. While the CLT does apply for large finite n, it also holds in the limit. The key difference is not when they apply, but what aspect of the distribution they describe.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the CLT and LLN are not equivalent. They describe different properties of the limiting behavior of the sample mean.\n\nOption D is correct. The CLT describes how the distribution of the standardized sample mean (\u221an(X\u0304\u2099 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) converges to a standard normal distribution. The LLN, on the other hand, describes how the unstandardized sample mean (X\u0304\u2099) converges in probability to the population mean (\u03bc). As n increases, the normal distribution described by the CLT becomes increasingly concentrated around zero (for the standardized mean) or \u03bc (for the unstandardized mean), eventually becoming a point mass at \u03bc in the limit, which is consistent with the LLN."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/13", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5424", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/66/"], "docs_id": 5424, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One thing I've heard conflicting advice on is how to handle a job search for two people simultaneously; especially the strategy of things like: when do you mention your situation to the departments in question?

That experience is based on applying to tenure track positions at major American research universities, and being male. \n\nMy wife works as a clinical research assistant, meaning that she runs experiments, files paperwork, recruits subjects and applies for grants, but she is not an academic and does not do her own research. She currently works at a hospital with a major research program; she has worked in university labs in the past.\n\nMy pattern, based on the advice of several older mathematicians, was to omit my wife from the paper applications but mention her early in the interview process. At times I brought this up when the chair first called me; more often I brought it up at the beginning of our face to face interview. My thinking was that I would not go anywhere that my wife could not find work, so it would be best to bring this issue up head on and find out how the university would respond.\n\nEverywhere I did this, I received a very positive and supportive response. Chairs and deans promoted the opportunities for my wife in their campuses and cities, and offered help in finding work. I did not try to get a commitment that my wife would be hired by the university, because my understanding is that it is not reasonable to ask for that sort of commitment for a nonacademic position, but I did attempt to determine whether it was likely she could find work at or near the university."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When applying for academic positions as part of a dual-career couple, what is the recommended approach for disclosing information about your partner's career needs?\n\nA) Include detailed information about your partner's career in your initial application and cover letter\nB) Mention your partner's career needs only if directly asked during the interview process\nC) Omit information about your partner from the paper application, but bring it up early in the interview process\nD) Wait until you receive a job offer to discuss your partner's career needs\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The recommended approach, according to the experience shared in the documentation, is to omit information about your partner from the paper application but mention it early in the interview process. This strategy allows you to bring up the issue directly with decision-makers, gauge their response, and discuss potential opportunities for your partner without potentially biasing the initial application review.

If TeX finds a false `\\if..` clause it looks at all following tokens until it finds a token equal to `\\else` or `\\fi` *without* expanding macros. If it finds another `\\if..` conditional it increases an internal counter and will look for the `\\fi` for this conditional before looking for the outer one.\n\nIf you have a macro like `\\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi}` the `\\fi` is hidden and not found. The same is true for own `\\if..` macros inside a *false* clause. Both will work in a *true* clause because there macros are expanded as normal.\n\nTo make your macro work you need to use `\\let\\fistudenti\\fi` instead, which makes `\\fistudenti` a token identical to `\\fi`. This is also the way used by `\\newif` to define now conditionals. The `\\xxxtrue` and `\\xxxfalse` macros defined by it simply include `\\let\\ifxxx\\iftrue` or `\\let\\ifxxx\\iffalse`.\n\nFor further reading have a look at the Q\\&A [What is an \\\\if?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/12015/2975)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In LaTeX, why does the command \\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi} not always work as expected when used in conditional statements?\n\nA) The \\fi token is case-sensitive and should be capitalized as \\FI\nB) \\newcommand creates a macro that hides the \\fi from TeX's conditional processing\nC) The \\fistudenti command should be defined using \\def instead of \\newcommand\nD) LaTeX doesn't support custom endings for conditional statements\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The issue stems from how TeX processes conditional statements. When TeX encounters a false \\if.. clause, it scans subsequent tokens for \\else or \\fi without expanding macros. By using \\newcommand{\\fistudenti}{\\fi}, the \\fi token becomes hidden inside a macro. TeX cannot see it directly, causing the conditional statement to fail in some cases.\n\nTo resolve this, one should use \\let\\fistudenti\\fi instead. This creates a token identical to \\fi that TeX can recognize during conditional processing. The \\let command creates an alias or reference to the existing \\fi command, rather than defining a new macro that contains \\fi.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect:\nA) Capitalization is not the issue here.\nC) Using \\def instead of \\newcommand would not solve the underlying problem of hiding \\fi in a macro.\nD) LaTeX does support custom handling of conditionals, but the implementation must be done correctly."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66443", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/13992/"], "docs_id": 66443, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **Related Stack Overflow Blog post:**\n> \n> \n> [Domain Names: The Wrong Question](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/)\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---\n\nApparently, the SE team is doing a complete 180\u00b0 turn and going from this:\n\n> American audiences, generally, don\u2019t trust series.

The announcement blog post also has been changed accordingly.\n\nIf you have a stake in Stack Exchange betas, **you probably better make yourself heard [in this question on ~~meta.nothingtoinstall.com~~ meta.webapps.stackexchange.com](https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/q/624/2703).**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've tried to refactor @Aarobot's answer so it is less angry and less personal\\-attack\\-ey, as I feel it has a lot of relevant points in it and people should be able to vote on them.\n\nSince it's more a recycling of someone else's answer I'm marking this Community Wiki.\n\n---\n\nThe Community Member: Why are they doing all of this?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of us here \\- all of us on the SE betas and Area 51 and even Stack Overflow and the trilogy sites to an extent \\- we're like volunteers.\n\nWhile Stack Exchange is composed of autonomous communities, the actual relationship of community members with the team is similar to that of volunteers; we do our thing because (a) we get a hearty pat on the back, (b) we get the occasional perks, and (c) we enjoy the contribution we're making.\n\nBut try this: describe the concept of what Stack Exchange community members do to a non\\-community member. Their response may surprise you if it's not \"Tell me more\", nor \"That sounds too technical\" but instead **\"Why are they doing all of this?\"**.\n\nCommunity Members want to be part of a knowledgeable community\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach of us wants to be part of a knowledgeable community, but the only other venues for that are clunky discussion forums. The success of Stack Overflow (and all related sites) however had less to do with a new kind of Q\\&A site, *and much more to do with a new kind of on\\-line community*.\n\nNow we're all \\- community members and team \\- working to create other similar communities. Community members were originally under the impression that they would get to contribute to and choose community identities, as this is what almost every healthy, functioning community does. An identity is central to any community, and its name is fundamentally tied to its identity.\n\nIt should be noted that, to anyone outside programming circles, \"Stack Exchange\" might as well be 102\\-47th Street. Individual sites become not so much communities as apartments in a nameless high\\-rise building \\- and that high\\-rise building has a strong identity build around a community of programmers.\n\nHow is a new site (Cooking and Whatever for example) going to establish an identity and a reputation as a separate community not standing on the shoulders of Stack Overflow if it is branded to seem like it is? Does it stand a chance to be perceived as \"The place where cooks and whateverers ask questions\" as opposed to \"The place where StackOverflowers ask cooking questions\"?\n\nContributing to communities has become discouraging\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMany of us out there are trying to contribute to building communities which will stand of their own, but the actions of the team have at times been discouraging:\n\n**\u2192 Note: Can someone add links/citations to these?**\n\n* [The Area 51 rules were changed and all of the votes were scrapped.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/52168/how-can-we-get-better-quality-on-and-off-topic-questions-in-our-site-proposals)\n* The beta period was extended from 60 days to 90 days, so activity dwindles while communities prepare to promote themselves (a difficult task while the site is still in beta).\n* Proposals like Software Engineering started getting questioned because the system failed to produce quality definitions, which was blamed as a failure of the community itself.\n* [Legitimate proposals like Compiler Design started getting canned on the grounds that they would be a \"drain\" on existing sites.](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/an-area-51-apology-and-clarification/)\n\nNow, communities are being denied the privilege of a name, which in turn hampers their identity.\n\nA big part of the problem is the following:\n\nWe don't care about Stack Exchange  We care about our individual communities.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe average community member won't care if every single proposal other than the ones they're actively involved in fails. None of us care about somebody else's community.\n\nWe don't care about the Stack Exchange brand. We don't care how many or how few sites there are, and while the success of many of those sites could impact the success of our communities, we are nonetheless indifferent to them.\n\nWe are donating ample amounts of our personal time to these proposals/betas for one reason and one reason only: So that we can be part of a community that we're proud of.\n\nWhat we don't want is to be a nameless, faceless portal page that's part of some conglomerate which only people in a specific industry have heard of. We'd rather at least try to make sites and communities which can stand on their own.\n\nIt seems to be that at least on WA, the community has spoken quite loudly in agreement with this principle.\n\nIf the team wants these communities to continue volunteering their time for Stack Exchange, then the communities need to *feel* more respected.\n\nWhile it's the team's company and the team doesn't *have* to do *anything* we say, it seems like there are a variety of obstacles discouraging us from forming communities. There are the bizarre voting rules on Area 51, which people don't \"get\"; there are extra\\-long beta periods which give the impression that that the team doesn't trust the community to keep the axles greased; there's the fact that when and how communities get their own names is ambiguous, almost suspicious, and there's an uneasy feeling of contempt and elitism which the community members sometimes get from the team. Perhaps above all else, if the team wants to [crowdsource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing), they need to try a little more to demonstrate that they don't feel contempt towards the crowd.\n\n\"Community based\" businesses should never give such a strong 180\u00ba turn without any explanation. This is a trust breaker. The subsequent turmoil should be a strong hint that the community management process has failed and should be improved at least by being more open.\n\nIf the team believes this is the right choice, and genuinely want support, then show us; if the team's passion for the sites and the communities leads them to believe this is best, there is no doubt they can show us, because [people respond to shared passion](http://vimeo.com/2796392). The fact that we are here at all **proves** this to be true.\n\nIf the team wants complete control over the entire process \\- maybe its the only thing which will work \\- then they should say so. Creating whatever sites they want, with whatever names and branding they want, and seeing how many people join and contribute is what was done with Stack Overflow, **and it worked.**\n\nBut right now there's a bunch of people (volunteers?) who feel like they have been lied to about their control over their communities, and that can be a serious risk to the Stack Exchange business."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary concern expressed by community members regarding Stack Exchange's decision to focus on the engine brand instead of individual site brands?\n\nA) The loss of potential advertising revenue for individual sites\nB) The lack of technical features on the Stack Exchange platform\nC) The diminishment of individual community identities and autonomy\nD) The increased difficulty in moderating content across multiple sites\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary concern expressed by community members is the diminishment of individual community identities and autonomy. The text highlights that community members care deeply about their individual communities and want to establish unique identities for each site. They fear that by focusing on the Stack Exchange brand instead of individual site brands, their communities will lose their distinct identities and become \"nameless, faceless portal pages\" within a larger conglomerate. This change is seen as potentially hampering the growth and recognition of individual communities, which is a core motivation for many volunteers who contribute their time and effort to these sites.\n\nThe other options are not directly addressed in the text:\nA) While branding could affect revenue, this is not mentioned as a primary concern.\nB) Technical features are not discussed as an issue in this context.\nD) Content moderation across sites is not raised as a concern related to the branding decision."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/01", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/483956", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/162559/"], "docs_id": 483956, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to configure replicated storage over three sites \\- each site having a full replica of a file system, using either GlusterFS, or XtreemeFS. This replica must be readable \\- very fast \\- locally to each site, without having to access any remote nodes (we intend to use the storage cluster to store a huge number of third party header files, and libraries for a large C\\+\\+ project). Writes must be possible from any site, but performance is not so important. Synchronous writes would be acceptable. Unfortunately, I seem to be running in to an issue, with how to configure these file systems to select a replica that is local to a site for high performance reads.\nI have also looked at DRBD, and creating a ring topology, or dual master replication, but rejected this idea, because it just seems too complex. I am software engineer, not IT person, so please forgive any ignorance in this area. I appreciate this this is a very technically difficult problem, and would like a good solution that handles the locking semantics for writes correctly.\nFor Gluster, I can't see any practical way to achieve this.\nFor XtreemeFS, I was assuming that that I could assign a 'datacenter map', and use storage policy WqRq, but unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work. It seems that if I have three replicas, I must have three replicas available to any server that attempts to write (for Gluster, it also seems that all three Bricks will also be written synchronously, regardless of site...). Do I need to set up replicated meta data server for XtreemeFS, each with a different ordering of data center map (to prioritise local replicate) to achieve this? How do I force usage of the local replicat on each site? Mounting appears to require the URL of the directory server, so there does not seem to be any easy way to force a specific ordering of replica selection.\nIs there any alternative that will allow me to have mutli\\-master writes, and suitable choice of local replicas, for good read performance?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Twitter's Fail Whale is more complicated then it seems. The Twitter applications stacks (Stacks\\-\\- there are many layers in the Twitter infrastructure) are known to be quite complicated. Twitter has thousands of machines, years worth of code written in various languages, glue in a dozen different flavors, and hundreds (if not thousands) of places where the application can break. Your requirements (two servers, and a failure page) is much simpler.\n\nI just happen to be looking at a similar feature\\-\\- I want to use a backup webserver if all of the primary webservers fail.

You want to set up a backup server that will only be used if all primary servers are unavailable. Which of the following commands would you use to add this backup server?\n\nA) server real-name-or-ip\nB) server remote-name\nC) server backup-name\nD) server failover-ip\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B) server remote-name. According to the ServerIron ADX Server Load Balancing Guide, a backup server is added using the \"server remote-name\" command or its Web equivalent. This type of server is used only when all primary servers are unavailable for the requested application.\n\nOption A) server real-name-or-ip is incorrect because this command is used to add primary servers, not backup servers.\n\nOptions C) and D) are distractors and do not represent actual commands mentioned in the given documentation for adding servers in ServerIron ADX.\n\nThe key distinction is that primary servers are locally attached and added with the \"server real-name-or-ip\" command, while backup servers are remotely attached and added with the \"server remote-name\" command."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/20", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/208185", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/242296/"], "docs_id": 208185, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I attempt to post the following question:\n\n> Hey, I recently started C\\+\\+ using SDL2 after a long time of C\\# (XNA\n>  and Unity3D)\n> \n> \n> I don't quite get how I create objects in my project, to explain what\n>  I mean..\n> \n> \n> In C\\# you can create a class SphereObject(as different file\n>  (SphereObject.cs) which then you can (from any class) do this (example\n>  in MainClass.cs)\n\n```\n    namespace MyProject\n     {\n         class MainClass\n         {\n             SphereObject sphere;\n             MainClass()\n             {\n                sphere = new SphereObject();\n             }\n          }\n     }\n\n```\n\n> Which would then call the constructor in SphereObject.cs\n> \n> \n> This essentially gives me an object of type SphereObject;\n> \n> \n> now maybe this is a big question..

By formatting this as a proper bulleted list using hyphens (-), the error is resolved. This small change in formatting is the most direct and effective solution to the specific error mentioned, without altering the content or structure of the rest of the question.\n\nOption A is excessive and would remove valuable information.
