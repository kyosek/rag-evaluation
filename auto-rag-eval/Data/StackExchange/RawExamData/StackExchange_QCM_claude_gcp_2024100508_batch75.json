In order to replace the second char we have 2 options, replacing it by $'c'$ and $'d'$. For the third char, we can replace it only by $'c'$. In total, we got 7 edges with this vertex, so by a theorem, we get that there isn't an Euler cycle.\n\nI cannot find here a pattern, because if we take a look at $n\\=2$ we get an Euler cycle.\n\n$Solution.B.$\n\nFirst, we examine whether each vertex has at least $\\\\frac{n}{2}$ neighbors. Hence, we should take the vertex to have the least number of neighbors. This vertex should be the string with disjoint chars. i.e. the string \"abcd\" when $n\\=4$. The first and last chars has always 2 neighbors, so we get that the least degree is: $$2\\+2\\+\\\\binom{n\\-2}{n\\-3} \\\\cdotp 1\\=4\\+n\\-2\\=n\\+2\\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{2}$$\n\nThus, we get that the graph always has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n---\n\nI don't get why I didn't get a pattern in $A$, and how $B$ can be proven by induction.

I am unable to change my home page to Yahoo, Google, etc. through usual methods. How can I fix this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I do not have experience with SPEEDbit, but in general, to restore Firefox's home page settings:\n\n1. Go to `about:config`\n2. **Reset** (`Right-click -> Reset`) the following preferences:\n\n\t* `startup.homepage_override_url`\n\t* `browser.startup.page`\n\t* `browser.startup.homepage`![reset](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eeNvs.png)\n\nI suspect that you could also do a search (filter) for `speedbit` in `about:config` and **reset** any related preferences. This would hopefully restore other hijacked preferences!\n\n---\n\nUpdate:\n-------\n\n***Warning: the following was performed by a professional in a secure, virtual test environment. Do not try this at home.***\n\nTo provide a more complete answer, I went ahead and installed the SPEEDbit `Download Accelerator Plus` (DAP) and their *\"recommended\"* additions or settings: `Search Predict`, `Video Downloader`, and `Video Accelerator`.\n\n![desktop](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30J4r.png)\n\n![add-ons](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTdtA.png)\n\n**Note:** You can **disable** these add\\-ons by going to `about:addons`.\n\n---\n\nNow, this is what my new Firefox profile looks like:\n\n![firefox profile](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMdXP.png)\n\nAs you can see, SPEEDbit added a toolbar, changed my home page and search bar.\n\n---\n\nLet's try to reset the home page using the GUI (`Options > General > Startup`):\n\n![reset home page](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H701J.png)\n\n**Note:** if you cannot restore the home page using the GUI, you can do so by **resetting** the following preferences in `about:config`:\n\n* `pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.restore_default`\n* `browser.startup.homepage`\n\nIt seems to have worked...\n\n![about:home](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uN5Xn.png)\n\nHowever, `Download Accelerator Plus` and `Video Accelerator` are still running:\n\n![tray](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CERkI.png)\n\nSo, let's restart the computer to see if our change persists.\n\n**SUCESS!** *(I would post a screenshot, but it would be identical to the one above. You'll have to trust me.)*\n\n---\n\nYour question only covered the **home page**, but I want us to poke around `about:config` to see what else SPEEDbit has got its dirty little paws into.\n\n![about:config](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMiKy.png)\n\nSo, to restore any other hijacked preferences, **reset** the following:\n\n* `browser.search.defaultenginename`\n* `browser.search.defaulturl`\n* `browser.search.order.1`\n* `browser.search.selectedEngine`\n* `browser.startup.homepage_override_url`\n* `keyword.URL`\n\nYour profile should now look like this:\n\n![restored](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxrKP.png)\n\n---\n\nAnd finally, if you want to hide the Video Downloader toolbar, **uncheck**:\n\n```\nView > Toolbars > SpeedBit Video Downloader\n\n```\n\n![toolbar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Up7N6.png)\n\n---\n\nNOT SO FAST!\n============\n\nSo, after one last reboot with `Download Accelerator Plus` and `Video Accelerator` still running, the search bar and `keyword.URL` were hijacked again. Is it one of the **add\\-ons**? Is is the aforementioned programs? Time to investigate. I'll skip the details and simply post my findings... `>:(`\n\n* **Disabling** all three add\\-ons was unsuccessful. The preferences were hijacked again after a reboot.\n* **Unchecking** `Mozilla/Firefox` integration under Download Accelerator Plus's `Options > Advanced` was unsuccessful.\n\n![browser integration](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZMxN.png)\n* Disabling Download Accelerator Plus or Video Accelerator from **auto\\-starting** was unsuccessful.\n* Disabling the Video Accelerator **service** from auto\\-starting was unsuccessful.\n\nThe *only thing* that stopped Firefox's preferences from being hijacked was to **uninstall** Download Accelerator Plus. Once you've uninstalled the software, retracing the above steps should work properly.\n\n---\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\n\nIf you want my personal opinion on the software, I would advise you not to use it. Due to it's rogue nature and malware\\-like appearance (ads, ads, and more ads), I have a hard time believing \"265 million users\" were satisfied with the product."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user's Firefox browser has been hijacked by SPEEDbit software, changing their homepage and search settings.

I have a few for different things. And if my computer crashed, I would have to generate new ones.

Consider the following question from the 2012 Stack Overflow Town Hall Chat, [asked by Michael Mrozek](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/136111/155826):\n\n> A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?\n\nYour past, present, and future behavior will all be seen in a different light, since your username, and the diamond, are attached to all of your questions, answers, comments, close votes, reopen votes, deletes, and undeletes. I've experienced first\\-hand how my actions have been interpreted much differently than on sites where I'm a regular user.\n\nBut many moderators also contribute regularly on other Stack Exchange sites where they are not moderators, where they do not carry a diamond by their names. The question is, if a moderator visits another site, how are his or her actions perceived by that community? If that moderator makes a statement in a comment on that site, does his or her words carry extra weight and have more of an effect on that community, whether it be positive or negative? Is this something that moderators should be mindful of when participating on other Stack Exchange sites, or should a moderator just act like a normal, everyday user on a site he or she does not moderate? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd guess that the vast majority of users will never notice that a specific user is a moderator on another site. There are over 200 moderators on SE, without the diamond most users won't be able to identify them. Moderators don't have diamonds on other sites, and most users likely don't know many moderators at all. Between closely related sites the chance is much higher that users know the moderators of their sister sites.\n\nAs long as you don't explicitly mention it, most users will probably never know that you're a moderator on another site. I don't think moderators need to act any different on sites where they don't have a diamond than normal users.\n\nThere is one exception, and that is that other moderators are likely to know that you are a moderator somewhere.

According to the documentation, most users won't recognize a moderator from another site unless it's explicitly mentioned. However, other moderators are likely to know and may give more weight to the opinions of a fellow moderator, especially if they're experienced or from a related site. Therefore, while a moderator can generally act like a normal user on other sites, they should be aware that their status might be recognized by other moderators and potentially influence interactions. Option A is incorrect as it goes against the idea of blending in as a normal user. Option B is close but doesn't account for the potential recognition by other moderators.

But what does the general solution represent? Another energy level? \n\nWhat is the significance of the general solution? Is it simply a quirk of the mathematics that it exists, or is it of physical significance?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So by \"general solution\" you mean something like\n$$\n\\\\psi\\_{general} \\= \\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^\\\\infty c\\_n \\\\left\\[\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right)\\\\right],\\\\ \\\\ c\\_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C},\n$$\nright? (I'm supposing that the infinite square well's walls are at $0$ and $a$, and I'm writing $c\\_j$ for arbitrary complex numbers. Also, note that I've pulled a constant factor $\\\\sqrt{2/a}$ out of the constants and put it into brackets\\-\\-\\-you'll see the reason for that in a bit.)\n\nThe thing is, this expression $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ doesn't have any physical meaning as is. You also have to pick values for the $c\\_n$ before you can think of it as a particular state. For example you could write\n$$\n \\\\psi \\= \\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^\\\\infty c\\_n\\\\left\\[\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right)\\\\right],\\\\\\\\\n c\\_n \\= 1/\\\\sqrt{100},\\\\ \\\\ n \\\\le 100, \\\\text{$n$ odd}\\\\\\\\\n c\\_n \\= 0, \\\\ \\\\ n \\\\le 100, \\\\text{$n$ even}\\\\\\\\\n c\\_n \\= 0, \\\\ \\\\ n \\\\ge 100\n$$\nor just\n$$\n\\\\psi \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{100}}\\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^{50} \\\\left\\[\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{(2n \\- 1 )\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right)\\\\right].\n$$\n\nVladimir Kalitviansky is exactly right that this sort of state is a \"superposition\" of a whole bunch of other states. What that means, though, is pretty deep. The idea is that when you're in a superposition of many states, you have a certain probability to end up in any of them. If I measure the energy of a particle in state $\\\\psi$, the wavefunction will collapse into a randomly selected one of the states\n$$\n \\\\psi\\_n \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right)\n$$\n(I think these are the separable solutions to which you refer) and you'll measure an energy $E\\_n \\= \\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$; the probability that the state will end up in any particular state $n$ is $\\|c\\_n\\|^2$, or in this case $1/100$. So: you start out in $\\\\psi$, I measure your energy to be $E\\_n$, and you end up in a state $\\\\psi\\_n$.\n\nIt's important to understand that which state you end up in is *totally random*. There is absolutely no way to tell beforehand what state it'll be, and therefore what energy will be measured\\-\\-\\-no hidden variables that determine what the state will turn out, and no correlations with other variables. Sure, you know that some states (those with the largest $c\\_n$ associated) will be more likely than others, but that's it. This is the principle behind many hardware random number generators.\n\nYou're presumably wondering about those functions $\\\\psi\\_n$. I haven't told you why the state will collapse into those particular functions. What's so special about the $\\\\psi\\_n$ as opposed to some other function\\-\\-\\-say, $\\\\arccos(\\\\sinh(\\\\exp(x)))$? Also, I just pulled the numbers $E\\_n$ out of nowhere, which is distinctly unsporting. \n\nWhat's going on is that these functions are *eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian* with *eigenvalue* $\\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2m}$. The vocabulary about eigen\\-stuff is just putting names to some facts I you've already realized: namely, that when I apply the Hamiltonian \n$$\n H \\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{dx}\n$$\nto one of the states $\\\\psi\\_n$, I get back $\\\\psi\\_n$ (the eigenfunction) multiplied by a constant $E\\_n$ (the eigenvalue)\\-\\-\\-that is to say,\n$$\n \\-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{dx} \\\\psi\\_n \\= \\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right) \\= E\\_n \\\\psi\\_n,\n$$\nwhich is just the (time\\-independent) Schrodinger equation. So, t'm in ao rephrase my summary: you start out in a superposition of states, I measure your energy, and you end up in some eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.\n\nThis is one (well, two) of the general axioms of quantum mechanics: if the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are $\\\\psi\\_n$ (these don't have to be the $\\\\psi\\_n$ I wrote down above, if the Hamiltonian is not the square\\-well Hamiltonian) and I measure the energy of a particle in a state $\\\\psi$, then the particle will end up in a state $\\\\psi\\_n$ with probability\n$$\nP(n) \\= \\\\left\\|\\\\int\\_{\\-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi\\_n^\\* \\\\psi\\\\ dx\\\\right\\|^2 \\= \\|c\\_n\\|^2\n$$\n(where $^\\*$ denotes complex conjugation\\-\\-\\-that always causes me some confusion, since mathematicians use the symbol differently). That last step (where I bring in the $c\\_n$s) is not totally obvious. It follows from the fact that the $\\\\psi\\_n$ are *orthonormal*\\-\\-\\-that is, $\\\\int\\_{\\-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi\\_j^\\*\\\\psi\\_k\\\\ dx \\= 1$ if $j \\= k$, and $0$ if $j \\\\ne k$. You'll want to work out for yourself exactly how that works. First, notice that the $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ can be written nicely in terms of the $\\\\psi\\_n$; then, plug that $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ into the above expression for $P(n)$; finally, prove that the particular $\\\\psi\\_n$ I wrote for the square\\-well case are orthonormal using a trig identity (that's why I put the constant out front of them). \n\nThis imposes the very important constraint that\n$$\n\\\\sum \\|c\\_n\\|^2 \\= \\\\sum P(n)\\= 1\\.\n$$\nThe particle has to end up in at least one of the states, so the sum of the probabilities can't be less than $1$, and it would be total nonsense for the total probability to be greater than $1$, so $1$ it is. This is called \"normalization\", as in \"the state is normalized\".\n\nAs another fun exercise, explore the state I gave you as a specific example. Plot it ($x$ in units of $a$), change that 100 to a bunch of different numbers $N$ (you'll have to change the value of the $c\\_j$ so that the state is normalized), and plot again. You should see that the state is more or less localized around $x \\= a/2$. What is the width of the state, and how does that width (call it $\\\\Delta x$) change with N? Given that the momentum of an eigenstate $\\\\psi\\_n$ is $p\\_n \\= \\\\sqrt{2mE} \\= n\\\\pi\\\\hbar /a$, how does this relate to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle? \n\nI should note that I've skipped a whole bunch of details, and not just in that exercise at the end.

For instance, consider the etymology for *garment* (as on [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/garment) and crosschecked with the Oxford English Dictionary or OED). \n\n> c. 1400, \"any article of clothing,\" reduced form of garnement (early 14c.), from Old French garnement \"garment, attire, clothes\" (12c.), from garnir \"fit out, provide, adorn,\" from a Germanic source (compare garnish (v.)), from PIE root \\*wer\\- (4\\) \"to cover.\"\n\n*Garnement* in Old French (a noun) was formed from a verb \\+ \\-ment. This kind of formation from Old French *\\-ment* and Latin *\\-mentum* has several examples, including the French\\-derived words *habiliment, abridgement, accomplishment,* and *commencement*, and the Latin\\-derived words *fragment, aliment,* and *ornament*. ([\"\\-ment, *suffix*,\" OED](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116535)) \n\nSo both French and English allow for the formation of nouns from verbs with *\\-ment.* What's remarkable is that, from Old French to now, *\\-ment* could also form adverbs from adjectives, and this *didn't* carry over to English. The *[Oxford Guide to Etymology](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Guide_to_Etymology.html?id=l0kTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=ment%20mente&f=false)* (2009\\) summarizes its origin from the Latin ablative phrase '(adjective) mente,' which in English terms served as an adverbial: \n\n> Affixes often result from grammaticalization of adverbs or prepositions. For instance, the adverb\\-forming suffix *\\-ment* in French (and likewise Spanish *\\-mente*, Italian *\\-mente*, etc.) originates in uses of Latin *mens*, *ment\\-* in the ablative case in collocations such as *clara mente* 'with a clear mind'. Such collocations showed semantic broadening, e.g. 'clear manner of being or behaving' rather than simply 'with a clear mind', and the pattern became extended to adjectival bases which had no connection with mental activity, ultimately giving rise to a very productive adverb\\-forming suffix.\n\nWhy did the adverb\\-forming *\\-ment* not carry over to English while the noun\\-forming *\\-ment* did? There's no sure answer, but my training as a medievalist makes a hypothesis tempting. There are a few possible suffixes for forming nouns from verbs in each language because the semantic possibilities are broad, so *\\-ion* (procession), *\\-tion* (solution), *\\-er* (bidder), and others all form nouns from verbs with different senses and limitations; *\\-ment* fills a place in the Middle English system for aristocratic items as well as functions of government. (See *government*.) That incorporation fits the history of England in that period, which had French\\-derived legal institutions and a French\\-speaking aristocracy. Shortly after that point, the suffix was naturalized into English and widely applied to words irrespective of origin. (An early example is *onement*, meaning roughly concord or agreement.)\n\nHowever, one suffix tends to dominate adverb formation in each language: English has the Old English\\-derived *\\-ly* and French has the Old French\\-derived *\\-ment*. The suffixes are so widespread and actively used that there is little reason for the suffix to cross over."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The English suffix '-ment' and the French suffix '-ment' have different grammatical functions. Which of the following statements best explains their relationship and development?\n\nA) The English '-ment' and French '-ment' are unrelated, with the English suffix deriving from Germanic languages and the French from Latin.\n\nB) Both suffixes originate from the Latin 'mentum', but diverged in function due to the Norman invasion of England in 1066.\n\nC) The English '-ment' derives from Old French, retaining its noun-forming function, while the French '-ment' evolved separately from Latin to form adverbs.\n\nD) Both suffixes have identical origins and functions in English and French, forming both nouns and adverbs interchangeably.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The English suffix '-ment' indeed derives from Old French, where it was used to form nouns from verbs (e.g., 'garnement' from 'garnir'). This noun-forming function was retained when the suffix was adopted into English. Meanwhile, the French suffix '-ment' used to form adverbs evolved separately from the Latin ablative construction 'mente', meaning 'with a ... mind'. This adverb-forming function did not carry over to English, which already had the suffix '-ly' for this purpose.

One thing I suppose I may have asked years ago, got the answer but have completely forgotten it now as it is not something I implicitly use a lot is destructors. As I am going through learning C\\# I read an article about how to create these in C\\# however it has left me wondering. Let say I instantiate a class which has an object to another class. \n\n```\nClass C1\n{\n  // Do something here\n}\n\nClass A\n{\n  C1 objObjectToClass1 = new C1();\n}   \n\nClass Main\n{\n   A objObjectToClassA = new A();\n}\n\n```\n\nand I make the object `objObjectToClassA` to `null` as I have been lead to believe that is the equivalent to `object = nothing` in VB.NET. \n\n```\nobjObectToClassA = null;\n\n```\n\nDoes this action also destroy `objObjectToClass1`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not as such, no. An object will be reclaimed by the garbage collector some time after it has become eligible for collection. This may be after you clear the last reference to it, but it could already be before if you never need the reference anymore after a certain point. But generally, setting a field where you store the instance to `null` will help the object becoming no longer reachable and getting reclaimed.\n\nGenerally you have no control over when objects are reclaimed by the GC. You can write *finalizers* which are methods that are called prior to reclaiming an object, but I'd very much *not* recommend it if you can help it. If you need a predictable way of causing an object to release any resources it might hold on to (what destructors in C\\+\\+ often do), then implement the [`IDisposable` interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable(v=vs.110).aspx):\n\n```\nclass C1 : IDisposable {\n  public void Dispose() {\n    // Do cleanup here\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis also enables you to use instances of that class in a [`using` statement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/yh598w02.aspx), which will call `Dispose` at the end of its block:\n\n```\nusing (var c1 = new C1()) {\n  // do stuf with c1 here\n} // at this point c1.Dispose() is automatically called\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In C#, when dealing with object lifecycle and resource management, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Setting an object reference to null immediately triggers the garbage collector to destroy the object and all its contained objects.\n\nB) Implementing a destructor in a class is the recommended way to handle resource cleanup in C#.\n\nC) The IDisposable interface and 'using' statement provide a predictable way to release resources, but don't guarantee immediate object destruction.\n\nD) Objects in C# are always destroyed as soon as they go out of scope, similar to stack-allocated variables in C++.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because setting an object reference to null doesn't immediately trigger garbage collection or destroy the object. It only makes the object eligible for collection at some future point.\n\nOption B is not recommended. While C# does have finalizers (similar to destructors), they are not deterministic and should be avoided if possible in favor of the IDisposable pattern.\n\nOption C is correct. The IDisposable interface, when implemented, allows for deterministic cleanup of resources. The 'using' statement ensures that Dispose() is called when the object goes out of scope. However, this doesn't guarantee immediate destruction of the object itself, only the release of its managed resources.\n\nOption D is incorrect. Unlike stack-allocated variables in C++, objects in C# are not immediately destroyed when they go out of scope.

This process typically involves centering the variables (subtracting the mean) and scaling them to have unit variance. Normalization ensures that PCA focuses on the correlations between variables rather than their absolute magnitudes or scales. This step is particularly important when variables have different units or ranges, as it prevents variables with larger magnitudes from dominating the analysis.

It leverages the existing StackOverflow platform for programming-related questions, which is suitable given the overlap between users and developers and the prevalence of C++ and CPython API questions. By using a specific tag (e.g., 'gem5') and hosting an RSS feed for that tag on the project's website, it becomes easy for users to find relevant questions and for experienced users to provide quick assistance. Additionally, maintaining a separate forum for non-programming questions addresses the limitation that some project-specific queries might be off-topic for StackOverflow. This balanced approach maximizes the benefits of StackOverflow while still catering to the specific needs of the project community.\n\nOption A (creating a new StackExchange site) is suggested only if the userbase is large enough to generate hundreds of questions per week, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

To *size* in this case means **[to make a particular size : bring to proper or suitable size](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/size)**.

I have personally found that, when it comes to removing components, very short exposure to high heat is preferable to prolonged exposure to low heat.\n That being said, I would NEVER re\\-use an aluminum electro \\- (if you MUST, at least check it with a reliable ESR meter first). Film caps take desoldering well as long as the barrel of the iron is kept away from the cap's body.\n\nMetal film and wirewound resistors can reliably survive desoldering and keep their value within spec; carbon films and (especially) carbon comps will sometimes \"open up\" in value to a small degree \\- (sometimes this is acceptable, sometimes not; check them with an ohmmeter before using).\n\nI've not had any problems desoldering diodes that are designed to take any degree of heat (such as DO\\-41's, DO\\-35's, DO\\-204's, etc.) Also, these are usually mounted \"off\\-the\\-board\" slightly.

So I would really appreciate if someone could explain to me what is going on here:\n\n* What is the intention of the `\\nhphantom` macro?\n* What does `\\sbox0` do?\n* What does `\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` do?\n\nI would also like to understand why the starred version of the `mathtools` commands don't work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TeX has something called a *box*, which is what it uses to organize things in the document. Knuth's TeX has 256 box registers for you to use. Think of that as 256 actual boxes available for TeX to store things and then use them in the document.\n\nThe command `\\sbox0{#1}` puts the contents of `#1` in the box register n\u00b0 `0`.\n\nNow that the box register `0` has `#1` you can do things with this box, like measure its width with `\\wd`, height with `\\ht`, and depth with `\\dp`, so `\\wd0` returns the with of the contents of the box `0`.\n\nSo, breaking apart the `\\nhphantom` macro:\n\n```\n% Store the contents of #1 into box register 0\n\\sbox0{#1}%\n% Go back -0.751 times the \\wd of the box register 0\n\\hspace{-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0 \\relax}\n\n```\n\nAlso, as egreg said in the comments, `-0.751\\dimexpr\\the\\wd0` is redundant. The `\\the` will get the text representation of `\\wd0`, then the `\\dimexpr` will read this text back into a number. You can skip this back\\-and\\-forth with `-0.751\\wd0`, so you can simplify to:\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[1]{\\sbox0{#1}\\hspace{-0.751\\wd0}}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThis register principle is what makes up TeX's memory. TeX has:\n\n* `\\count` registers to hold counters (integers);\n* `\\dimen` registers to hold lengths;\n* `\\skip` registers to hold glue (one dimen plus another minus one more);\n* `\\muskip` registers to hold muglue (for maths);\n* `\\box` registers to hold boxes; and\n* `\\toks` registers to hold lists of tokens.\n\n---\n\nAs for your question about the starred versions (which I saw only now, sorry)...\n\nThe `\\sbox0{#1}` in the `\\nhphantom` macro saves the contents of `#1` in an `\\hbox`, which is *not* in math mode, thus you have to call `\\nhphantom` with `$...$` to enforce math mode. But this creates a math mode in text mode in math mode thing, which makes TeX \"forget\" about the rest of the equation it is in.\n\nWhen you use a starred version of a delimiter created by `\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX`, you make the outer delimiters be `\\left<delim>` and `\\right<delim>`, and the `\\delimsize` becomes `\\middle` to be used safely between `\\left` and `\\right`. The problem is that the math\\-in\\-text\\-in\\-math thing makes TeX forget about the surrounding `\\left` and `\\right` and the argument of `\\nhphantom` is `$\\middle\\lbrack$`, which is invalid because you cannot use `\\middle` without an enclosing `\\left...\\right`.\n\nTo workaround this issue I changed the `\\nhphantom` macro a little. It now has two arguments: the delimiter and the content in between. The `\\nhphantom` macro then measures the width of `\\left<delim>\\vphantom{#1}\\right.`, which is valid.\n\nHere is the complete working code:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\usepackage{mathtools}\n\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbrackets}[1]{\\lbrack}{\\rbrack}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrack}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrack \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrack \\nhphantom{\\rbrack}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dbraces}[1]{\\lbrace}{\\rbrace}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lbrace}{#1} \\delimsize\\lbrace \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rbrace \\nhphantom{\\rbrace}{#1}\n}\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiterX{\\dparens}[1]{\\lparen}{\\rparen}{\n    \\nhphantom{\\lparen}{#1} \\delimsize\\lparen \\mathopen{} #1 \\mathclose{} \\delimsize\\rparen \\nhphantom{\\rparen}{#1}\n}\n\n\\newcommand{\\nhphantom}[2]{\\sbox0{$\\left#1\\vphantom{#2}\\right.$}\\hspace{-0.58\\wd0}}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n$\\dbrackets[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens[\\big]{\\frac12}$\n\n%These do work :)\n\n$\\dbrackets*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dbraces*{\\frac12}$\n$\\dparens*{\\frac12}$\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjKxX.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the \\sbox0{#1} command in the \\nhphantom macro?\n\nA) To create a new box register\nB) To store the contents of #1 in box register 0\nC) To measure the width of #1\nD) To enforce math mode for the contents of #1\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \\sbox0{#1} command stores the contents of #1 in box register 0.

Since $L^{\\-}$ is free, it admits a section\n$L^{\\-} \\\\rightarrow L$, and hence the kernel\n$L^{\\+}$ of $L \\\\rightarrow L^{\\-}$ is also free. Thus\nthe existence of a free rank one quotient asked\nfor in the question is equivalent\nto the existence of the exact sequence above.)\n\nThe answer to this question, in general, is no. The following argument\nis implicitly contained in papers of Wiese on the failure of multiplicity\none and weight one forms.\n\nThe action of $G\\_{\\\\Q\\_p}$ on $L^{\\+}$ is unramified and so acts\nvia $G\\_{\\\\mathbf{F}\\_p}$. Thus $\\\\Frob\\_p$ acts on a basis vector\nas multiplication by some element of $\\\\T$. Since $\\\\T$ is determined\nby its action on classical eigenforms,\none may identify this element with the Hecke operator $U$. In particular,\n$U \\\\in \\\\T$ (it wasn't clear whether your $\\\\T$ included $U$ or not).\n\nThe exact sequence remains exact after tensoring with $\\\\T/\\\\m$,\nfor dimension reasons. It follows that the sequence is split as a sequence\nof $\\\\T$\\-modules. Hence it remains exact after quotienting out by\nany ideal of $\\\\T$.\n\nSuppose that $\\\\rhobar: G\\_{\\\\Q} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{GL}\\_2(\\\\F\\_p)$ is\nirreducible and modular (mod\\-$p$) of weight $1$. Suppose, moreover, that \n$\\\\rhobar(\\\\Frob\\_p)$ acts by a scalar $\\\\lambda$.\nAssociated to $\\\\rhobar$ is a mod\\-$p$ weight $1$ form\n$f \\= \\\\sum a\\_n q^n \\\\in \\\\F\\_p\\[\\[q]]$. If $A$ is the Hasse invariant, then\nthen $Af$ and $f^p$ are both mod\\-$p$ modular forms of weight $p$. One can check\nthat all elements of the $\\\\F\\_p$\\-vector space $\\\\{Af,f^p\\\\}$ are eigenvalues for all the Hecke operators\n$T\\_l$ for $(l,p) \\= 1$, but the operator $T$ (and so $U$, which is the\nsame as $T$ in weight $\\> 1$) satisfies \n$(U \\- \\\\lambda)^2 \\= 0$ but does not act by a scalar. Since $U$ acts\ninvertibly on this vector space, it gives rise to a surjective map:\n$$\\\\T \\\\rightarrow \\\\F\\_p\\[\\\\eps]/\\\\eps^2,$$\nwhere the image of $T\\_l$ lands in $\\\\F\\_p$ for all $(l,p) \\= 1$, but $U$\ndoes not act by a scalar. Let $I$ be the kernel.\n\nThe Galois representation on $(\\\\T)^2/I \\\\simeq (\\\\F\\_p\\[\\\\eps]/\\\\eps^2\\)^2$\nis equal to $\\\\rhobar \\\\oplus \\\\rhobar$. This follows from a result of Boston\\-Lenstra\\-Ribet,\nsince $T\\_l$ is acting by a scalar for each $(l,p) \\= 1$. It follows, by assumption, that\nthe action of $G\\_{\\\\Q\\_p}$ on $L^{\\+}/I L^{\\+} \\\\simeq \\\\T/I$ must also be trivial,\nbecause this is a sub\\-representation of $\\\\rhobar \\\\oplus \\\\rhobar$. On the other hand, as we have seen, the action of Frobenius on $L^{\\+}$ and thus $L^{\\+}/I L^{\\+} \\= \\\\T/I$ is given\nby $U$, which is acting non\\-trivially $\\\\T/I$ by the construction of $I$.

Specifically, for certain irreducible mod-p representations \u03c1bar of weight 1 where the Frobenius element acts by a scalar, the construction leads to a contradiction. This is demonstrated using the action of the U operator on the space spanned by Af and f^p, where f is a mod-p weight 1 form. The contradiction arises from the fact that the action of Frobenius on L^+/IL^+ should be trivial (as a subrepresentation of \u03c1bar \u2295 \u03c1bar) but is actually non-trivial due to the action of U. This shows that the existence of such a free rank 1 quotient is not guaranteed in general, making option D the correct choice."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/30", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6536992", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/823317/"], "docs_id": 6536992, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been writing a sort of online spreadsheet application for a specific purpose and along with it I have written my own undo and redo functions.

It prevents the default browser behavior using `e.preventDefault()` and returns `false` for good measure.\n6.

The edited part of the answer specifically addresses this, suggesting that a clog is likely if the tank refills properly. Using a plunger should be the first step in diagnosing and potentially resolving this issue. If plunging doesn't work, further steps like snaking the drain might be necessary.

How the op\\-amp circuit will be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several undefined elements in your question. The first is the fact that you don't mention the kind of filter. From your \\\\$Q\\\\$ values, it can be worked out that you are talking about a Butterworth filter. But you didn't mention this fact. You should have. Second, you have mentioned nothing about the input signal range. Third, you've said nothing about the rail voltages you plan to have available for the design. Forth, you've said nothing about what you have available for implementation: for example, you may use opamps; but you could also use NPN BJTs for each stage, as well. (The opamp is obviously a better choice than a single BJT. But still this may be important.) Fifth, you've said nothing about what the filter must drive \\-\\- we know nothing about the load. Etc. In short, we really have a lot more that we don't know which is important than what we do know that is important. You should write a lot more about your situation, at hand.\n\nIf you use Sage/sympy, it's not at all difficult to write up a script to generate Butterworth constants:\n\n```\ndef Butterworth(n):\n    r = solve( 1+(-1)**n*x**(2*n), x )\n    t = []\n    for a in r:\n        if real( a ) < 0:\n            t.append( a )\n    t.sort( key = lambda tup: real( tup ) )\n    u = []\n    var( 's' )\n    if ( len( t ) - 2*int( len( t ) / 2 ) ) == 1:\n        u.append( s + 1 )\n        t.pop( 0 )\n    for i in range( len( t ) / 2 ):\n        u.append( expand( (s - t[2*i]) * (s - t[2*i+1]) ).n() )\n    return u\n\n```\n\nI am sure that experts might provide a better implementation. But that one does work okay. For example, writing:\n\n```\nfor a in Butterworth(4): print(a)\n\n```\n\nproduces:\n\n```\ns**2 + 1.84775906502257*s + 1.0\ns**2 + 0.765366864730179*s + 1.0\n\n```\n\nThose constants are each the same as \\\\$2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$ or \\\\$\\\\frac1{Q}\\\\$. So, it follows that:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}Q\\_1\\&\\=\\\\frac1{1\\.84775906502257}\\&\\&\\=0\\.541196100146198\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Q\\_2\\&\\=\\\\frac1{0\\.765366864730179}\\&\\&\\=1\\.30656296487638\\\\end{align\\*}$$\n\nWhich is how I recognized your filter type.\n\nThe Sallen\\-Key topology is the next aspect of your question. Since Sallen \\& Key were focused on replacing inductors with capacitors in their paper, it's no surprise that the general form is:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVyPr.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOVyPr.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nClearly, in the above, it is possible to set \\\\$R\\_3\\=0\\\\:\\\\Omega\\\\$ to get a voltage follower where \\\\$K\\=1\\\\$. However, the general transfer function is:\n\n$$\\\\frac{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{OUT}}}{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{IN}}}\\=\\\\frac{K\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{0}^2}{s^2\\+\\\\left(\\\\frac1{R\\_1\\\\,C\\_2}\\+\\\\frac1{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_2}\\+\\\\frac1{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1}\\-\\\\frac{K}{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1}\\\\right)s\\+1}$$\n\nHere, \\\\$K\\=1\\+\\\\frac{R\\_3}{R\\_4}\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}^2\\=\\\\frac1{R\\_1\\\\,R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1\\\\,C\\_2}\\\\$.\n\nYou've specified the corner frequency at \\\\$33\\\\:\\\\text{kHz}\\\\$ and the capacitor values all at \\\\$1\\\\:\\\\text{nF}\\\\$, I think. (But I'm not entirely sure, on that last point.) You only want the resistor values. The overall gain is to be \\\\$0\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$, but the gain of each Sallen\\-Key stage (if you use equal valued \\\\$R\\\\$ and \\\\$C\\\\$ in its design) is then determined by its damping factor. It looks right now as though you expect all capacitor values to be the same. So I'm going to make the same assumption for the values of \\\\$R\\\\$ in order to keep this simple and to avoid waiting for answers from you that may not be forth\\-coming.\n\nTaking the above assumptions, that all \\\\$C\\\\$ values are the same and that all \\\\$R\\\\$ values are the same, then the new transfer function is:\n\n$$\\\\frac{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{OUT}}}{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{IN}}}\\=\\\\frac{K\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}^2}{s^2\\+\\\\left(3\\-K\\\\right)\\\\omega\\_{\\_0} s\\+1}$$\n\nHere, \\\\$3\\-K\\=2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$, so it follows that \\\\$K\\=3\\-2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$. From this, the damping factors determined by the Butterworth polynomials then also can be understood to determine the overall gain of each Sallen\\-Key 2nd order stages:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}A\\_{V\\_1}\\&\\=3\\-1\\.84775906502257\\&\\&\\=1\\.15224093497743\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\A\\_{V\\_2}\\&\\=3\\-0\\.765366864730179\\&\\&\\=2\\.23463313526982\\\\end{align\\*}$$\n\nThis results in an overall gain of \\\\$A\\_v\\=2\\.57483577311484\\\\$ for both stages. Since that isn't desired, you'll need to further reduce this with a prior input stage, a stage between the two, or a 3rd stage. How you handle this is up to you and your understanding of the circumstances. So the arrangement of each stage (their ordering) is left to you to work out.\n\n[This page](https://www.ece.uic.edu/%7Ejmorisak/blpf.html) provides an excellent overview and provides you with the tools you need to convert from the analytical \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\=1\\\\$ form to specific resistor and capacitor values that relate to a given \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\\\$ value other than 1\\. Please follow their instructions to reach your desired resistor values. (That web site also provides you with the justification for the Butterworth design approach \\-\\- so it includes a lot for you to study and learn about.)\n\nIt's really not that hard to achieve.\n\nSo here's a shot at it. In contrast to the discussion I had with Andy (see the discussion below his answer here), I'll select the higher\\-**Q** stage (and therefore also higher gain) to be the 1st stage. The reason for this is that you usually want the highest gain as the 1st stage for noise reasons. However, keep in mind that I've no idea what's driving this system and you may want either still more more gain, or less, in the first stage. So you may actually want a \"pre\\-amplifier.\" But since we know nothing, really, let me just choose a path and follow it. Meanwhile, it's important that ***you*** keep in mind that this is just a choice and not necessarily the better choice for any given circumstance.\n\nWith that choice for the 1st stage, I'll follow it by an attenuating stage which only has the single purpose of reducing the signal sufficiently so that the final 2nd Butterworth stage can pick up from there and complete the picture.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EExVy.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fEExVy.png)\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bi0XX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bi0XX.png)\n\nWhich is as would be expected.\n\nAs I said before, it's not all that complicated.\n\nI used standard resistor values from the [E12 series](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/381906/38098)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 4th order Butterworth low-pass filter with a corner frequency of 33kHz and overall DC gain of 0dB is to be designed using Sallen-Key architecture.

You have a multiple regression using time series data within an econometrics model. And, some of your variables are either dummy variables or interaction variables. So, they take a value of 0 or a continuous value. As an example, let's say one of your variable is the quarterly change in 5 year Treasury rate. And, you disaggregate that variable into two. One would cover the pre\\-Greenspan era from 1951 to 1986\\. And, the other one would cover the Greenspan era to the present. The first variable will show the quarterly change in such Treasury rates until mid 1986\\. Thereafter, it will have a value of 0 or 0%. Someone suggested that instead such a variable in the Greenspan era to the present should not have a zero value, but instead be blank. In essence, creating purposefully missing values. The argument is that this variable does not have a true value of 0% in the specified time frame. Instead, it is truly absent. And, this could affect the magnitude of its regression coefficient or impact on Y. I question this rational on two counts. First, I am not sure that any software could calculate such a regression with variables with different numbers of observations. And, I think there is a very specific reason for that as outlined in my second argument. Second, multiple regressions are resolved through matrix algebra including the use of covariance matrices and the inverting and transposing of such matrices. And, those calculations are impossible with missing values on some of the variables. In my mind, I believe I have already answered this question. Can you tell me if this answer is correct. Or am I missing something. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not that matrix computations are especially finicky: the plain old arithmetical operations they concisely represent are defined on *numbers*. You can't carry out a regression when an observation has a missing value on a predictor; you need to either substitute a number, or omit the predictor, or omit the observation.\n\nIt may assuage someone's doubts to work out the consequences of your coding scheme.

Note the constraint that when $x$ is zero, $\\\\operatorname{E} Y$ is the same in both time periods (given equal values of other predictors)\u2014most people would want this violation of the marginality principle to have theoretical support as well as not being discrepant with the data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multiple regression model using time series data, you have a variable representing the quarterly change in 5-year Treasury rates.

First all of the right side statements are evaluated, and then all of the left side signals are assigned.

It also appears somewhat biased given the \"circular\" nature of question\\-answer from the same person. \n\nThis is not to say that the information provided and the research shown in the accepted answers are not good but it sounds like the OP already knew the answer they were looking for was before asking ( so why ask?)\n\nP.S. nothing personal with any user, I just would like to understand what's the community view on this issue. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Provided that it is done under the right circumstances, I see nothing wrong with it. One thing that needs to be considered is that it is not as if Stack Exchange has simply neglected the possibility of doing it. [They are fully aware of what they have done, and actually decided to build in limitations which severely limit the negative effects of any abuse or undue bias.](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/01/06/accept-your-own-answers/)\n\nIt does not come with the usual benefits of an accepted answer: It will neither be sorted to the top automatically, nor will it earn you reputation points. The only thing given to you is a big green checkmark, which means significantly less when self\\-awarded than it does when it is awarded as a show of appreciation for what somebody else believes to be the single best answer out of all of other tries. Stack Exchange also imposes a 48 hour limit on accepting your own answer, which forces the original questioner to at least consider accepting somebody else's answer if any potentially better ones come along within that time frame. \n\nIf it was something the network designers really did not want you to do under any circumstance, they would not limit it like this. It would be easier to prevent you from being able to do it at all. In consideration of these factors, and the fact that self\\-accepted answers from the same account are automatically disclosed, I see nothing unethical about it, provided that it is not done from a fraudulent account to abuse the system to gain unfair advantages and give people the impression that your answer is better than it really is.\n\nPeople accepting their own answer may even be somewhat of a boon for us. There are a couple of reasons for this: The first is that the gamification of Stack Exchange is a secondary concern: Our ultimate goal is to teach and learn from each\\-other, and anything which may facilitate that process is something we want to allow. We want to encourage people to try and research their own questions, and share any *interesting* information they find with us. That is why we allow [answering your own question](https://english.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer) in the first place. It is also why [we allow partial answers to questions](https://english.stackexchange.com/help/deleted-answers), even from people [who are having the same problem](https://english.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer). [Just so long as the question is not *too* simple](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/22/are-some-questions-too-simple/), we want to pick our members' brains apart until everything they are willing to share under any circumstances is archived and on display. If that means indulging some egotism, then so be it.\n\nAlso remember that [answer acceptance](https://english.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer) is not an indicator of which answer is the best or most correct to anybody other than the original poster, so if their own answer to their question really does makes the most sense to them, that is the one that should be accepted, until somebody else comes along and persuades them that there is a better answer by providing it. In this respect, a self\\-accepted answer sets the minimum bar of quality that the questioner expects of future answers, because they surely will not accept an answer that is worse than the currently accepted answer, and especially not when it is their own.\n\nThis is not to say it is always a good thing to do. Indeed, accepting too many of your own answers may suggest that your personal bias towards yourself clouds your judgement, which is perhaps useful for letting other members know that they should not necessarily trust you. In order to avoid this perception, before you accept your own answer, you should really try to think long and hard about if your answer really is the best answer, or if your personal bias is clouding your ability to accurately judge it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the StackExchange documentation, what are the key limitations and considerations when accepting your own answer to a question you've posted?\n\nA) There is no time limit on accepting your own answer, and it will be automatically sorted to the top of all answers.\n\nB) You can accept your own answer immediately, but you won't earn any reputation points for doing so.\n\nC) You must wait 48 hours before accepting your own answer, and it won't be automatically sorted to the top or earn you reputation points.\n\nD) You can accept your own answer at any time, and it will earn you double the usual reputation points as a reward for solving your own problem.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

As described in Cap \\& Slovak 1\\.5\\.17, on a Cartan geometry $(\\\\mathcal{P} \\\\to M, \\\\omega)$ modelled on $G/P$, we have a \"Cartan space\" which is an associated bundle $S :\\=\\\\mathcal{P} \\\\times^P G/P \\\\to M$ that comes equipped with a canonical section $O: x \\\\mapsto \\[u, eP]$ as well as a connection induced by the Cartan connection. Then there is a development map which takes germs of curves in the base $M$ to germs of curves in the model $G/P$ (technically the fibre of the Cartan space until we pick a frame in the $\\\\mathcal{P}$). Explicitly, for a (germ of a) curve $c$ in $M$ with $c(0\\)\\=x$, we get (a germ of a) curve $\\\\mathrm{dev}\\_c$ in the fibre $S\\_x$ of the Cartan space given by $$\\\\mathrm{dev}\\_c(t) :\\= \\\\mathrm{Pt}\\_{c\\_t}((O(c(t)),\\-t)$$\nwhere $c\\_t(s) :\\= c(t\\+s)$. After picking a frame $u \\\\in S\\_x$ we can identify $S\\_x$ with the model $G/P$.\n\nSince n\\-dimensional (oriented) Hyperbolic geometry can be viewed as a Cartan geometry modelled on $\\\\mathrm{SO}(n,1\\)/\\\\mathrm{SO}(n)$, we also have this notion of development of curves in hyperbolic geometry.\n\nBut in the hyperbolic geometry literature (which I am mostly unfamiliar with) there is another notion of developing/development: For $(M,g)$ a connected hyperbolic $n$\\-manifold, there is a developing/development map on the universal cover $\\\\mathrm{dev}: \\\\widetilde{M} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{H}^n$ which is an isometry if $M$ is complete (if I remember correctly).\n\nIs there some nice way to related these two notions of development? Or is the naming mostly coincidence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Of course it is the same. Any submanifold on which the curvature of a Cartan geometry vanishes has a developing map from its universal covering space.

The top answer in the StackExchange post explicitly states that these two notions of development are indeed the same concept. Specifically, it mentions that for any submanifold on which the curvature of a Cartan geometry vanishes, there exists a developing map from its universal covering space. This implies that the developing map in hyperbolic geometry is a special case of the more general notion of development in Cartan geometry, occurring when we have a flat (zero curvature) submanifold.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the concepts are not unrelated.

Somebody told me that in QFT a ***particle*** is viewed as an irregularity in the field.\n\nOn the other hand, in an [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) in Wikipedia I see the sentence \"*A QFT treats particles as excited states of an underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.*\"\n\nWhich one of the true is a better description? The 1st description hints that the particle is a localized phenomenon inside a field that maybe occupies a big region in space. The 2nd description speaks of an \"*underlying*\" field. So, is there a field and in addition there is a particle? If it is, then what is the *occupation number* of that \"*underlying*\" field?\n\nNone of these approaches is clear to me, I know the approach in QM, and none of them resembles the QM.\n\nThe motivation behind my question is a certain similarity that I find between the above descriptions and the Bohm interpretation of QM, (i.e. the background field \\- in Bohm's interpretation there is a background quantum potential \\- and a particle floating in it.)\n\nIn all, is a particle treated in QFT as a localized phenomenon inside a field occupying a wider volume? I would appreciate a simple and direct answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Somewhat surprisingly, the \"generic\" particle of QFT is in fact totally delocalized.\n\nMore precisely, *particles* are thought to come from the mode expansion of *free fields*. Since every free relativistic field $\\\\phi$ fulfills the Klein\\-Gordon equation $(\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu \\- m^2\\)\\\\phi \\= 0$, a Fourier transform shows that it can be expanded as\n\n$$ \\\\phi(x) \\= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3p}{(2\\\\pi)^3}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2p^0}}(a(\\\\vec p)\\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\mathrm{i}px} \\+ a^\\\\dagger(\\\\vec p)\\\\mathrm{e}^{\\-\\\\mathrm{i}px})$$\n\nwhere Lorentz invariance is not manifest, but can nevertheless be shown. A quantum field is *operator\\-valued*, and the operator valued objects $a(\\\\vec p),a^\\\\dagger(\\\\vec p)$ fulfill exactly the correct commutation relations to be interpreted as creation and annihilation operators. The $n$\\-particle state of particles that are associated with the field $\\\\phi$ is now *defined* as\n\n$$ \\\\lvert n;p\\_1,\\\\dots,p\\_n \\\\rangle :\\= a^\\\\dagger(p\\_1\\)\\\\dots a^\\\\dagger(p\\_n)\\\\lvert \\\\Omega \\\\rangle$$\n\nwhere $\\\\lvert \\\\Omega \\\\rangle$ is the (mostly) unique vacuum state. In this way, you first create all particle states that are sharply localized in *momentum space* (and hence completely delocalized in position space) and you can build localized particle states by the usual building of \"wavepackets\" with fuzzy momentum out of the sharp momentum states:\n\nA QM wavepacket of width $\\\\sigma\\_x$ localized at $x\\_0$ is constructed out of the pure momentum states $\\\\lvert \\\\vec p \\\\rangle$ as something like $$\\\\lvert x\\_0,\\\\sigma\\_x\\\\rangle \\= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3 p}{(2\\\\pi)^3}\\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\mathrm{2i\\\\sigma\\_x^2(x \\- x\\_0\\)^2}}\\\\lvert p \\\\rangle$$It works exactly the same for localized QFT particles, except that one should multiply the measure with $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2p^0}}$ to have a Lorentz invariant integration, and, of course, $\\\\lvert p \\\\rangle \\= a^\\\\dagger(p)\\\\lvert \\\\Omega \\\\rangle$.\n\nThe idea that \"particles are local excitations of the fields\" comes from the observation that this mode expansion is almost completely analogous to a classical field fulfilling a wave equation like the Klein\\-Gordon equation, where the $a(\\\\vec p),a^\\\\dagger(\\\\vec p)$ would directly represent an excitation of the field of wavenumber $\\\\vec p$. It *cannot* be made precise in the context of QFT because the quantum field is operator\\-valued and has no definite values, so it is wholly unclear what rigorous sense could be given to it being \"excited\". It is a nice picture, but nothing you should take too literally.\n\nAlso, take note that this is for the *free field*. The true interacting field of a QFT cannot be mode expanded in this way, and particle states are (through the LSZ formalism) only obtained in the asymptotic past and future (when they were far enough apart for interactions to be effectively non\\-existent) of the theory \\- the Hilbert space (and hence any states you could or could not identify as particles) of interacting QFTs is essentially *unkown*.\n\nFurthermore, more mathematical methods of constructing QFTs often first construct the $a,a^\\\\dagger$ and the Fock space of particle states, and then define the field out of it \\- then, the roles of particle and field as \"fundamental\" and \"derived\" are somewhat reversed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided QFT documentation:\n\nQuestion: In quantum field theory, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between particles and fields?\n\nA) Particles are always sharply localized excitations of the quantum field.\n\nB) Particles are fundamentally delocalized in position space and are defined as states created by applying creation operators to the vacuum state.\n\nC) The quantum field is derived from particle states, while particles are the fundamental entities.\n\nD) Interacting quantum fields can always be mode expanded to define particle states precisely.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because in QFT, particles are primarily defined as states created by applying creation operators to the vacuum state. These states are initially sharp in momentum space and thus completely delocalized in position space. Localized particle states can be constructed as superpositions of these momentum eigenstates, similar to wavepackets in quantum mechanics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because particles in QFT are not fundamentally localized excitations. The idea of particles as local excitations is more of an analogy to classical field theory and cannot be made mathematically precise in QFT.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in standard QFT, fields are typically considered fundamental and particle states are derived from them. While some mathematical approaches may reverse this, it's not the standard view.\n\nOption D is incorrect because interacting quantum fields cannot generally be mode expanded in the same way as free fields. Particle states in interacting theories are typically only well-defined in the asymptotic past and future when interactions are negligible.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the fundamental concepts of particles and fields in QFT, challenging common misconceptions and emphasizing the more abstract nature of particles in this framework."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/18", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/308631", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/17218/"], "docs_id": 308631, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it true that $$\\\\operatorname{li}(x)\\-\\\\operatorname{Ri}(x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{li}(x^{1/2}) \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty),$$\nwhere\n$$\\\\operatorname{Ri}(x) \\= \\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\mu(n)}{n} \\\\operatorname{li}(x^{1/n}) \\= 1 \\+ \\\\sum\\_{k \\= 1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(\\\\log x)^k}{k \\\\cdot k!\\\\ \\\\zeta(k\\+1\\)}$$\nfor all $x \\> 0$?
