In general does there exist a number $m$ such that $r\\\\ne m $ for any $\\\\sqrt{d}$ ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes there are infinitely many. And it is not difficult to find them.\n\nWe seek continued fractions of the form\n\n$\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[a,\\\\overline{b,c,2a}]$\n\nFirst off, add $a$ to get a \"pure\" periodic expression. We shall call the quadratic surd $x$:\n\n$x\\=a\\+\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[\\\\overline{2a,b,c}]$\n\nWe may then render\n\n$x\\=2a\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{b\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{c\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{x}}}$\n\nand upon clearing fractions\n\n$(bc\\+1\\)x^2\\+(b\\-c\\-2a(bc\\+1\\))x\\-(2ab\\+1\\)\\=0$\n\nNow comes the sneaky part. If the above quadratic equation over the integers is to have a root $a\\+\\\\sqrt{N}$, its other root must be $a\\-\\\\sqrt{N}$ forcing the linear coefficient to be exactly $\\-2a$ times the quadratic one! Thereby $b\\=c$ above and the quadratic equation simplifies to:\n\n$(b^2\\+1\\)x^2\\-2a(b^2\\+1\\)x\\-(2ab\\+1\\)\\=0$\n\nThis gives an integer radicand whenever $2ab\\+1$ is a multiple of $b^2\\+1$, in which cases the common factor of $b^2\\+1$ may be cancelled from the quadratic equation leaving the equation monic.\n\nSuppose, for example, we drop in $b\\=2$. Then $2ab\\+1$ is to be a multiple of $5$ and $a$ can be any whole number one greater than a multiple of $5$. Putting $a\\=1$ results in the \"trivial\" solution $\\\\sqrt{2}\\=\\[1,\\\\overline{2}]$, as the period is reduced from three to one due to $b\\=c\\=2a$. But this equality is avoided for larger eligible values of $a$ and we get a series of period $3$ solutions. In all cases $N$ is one fourth the discriminant of the monic polynomial obtained after cancelling out the $b^2\\+1$ factor:\n\n$a\\=6\\\\to \\\\sqrt{41}\\=\\[6,\\\\overline{2,2,12}]$\n\n$a\\=11\\\\to \\\\sqrt{130}\\=\\[11,\\\\overline{2,2,22}]$\n\n$a\\=5k\\+1\\\\to \\\\sqrt{25k^2\\+14k\\+2}\\=\\[5k\\+1,\\\\overline{2,2,10k\\+2}]$\n\nThere are more families of solutions like this with other values of $b$. Just put in an even positive value for $b$ (why even?) and turn the crank. You must put $a\\>b/2$ to avoid the collapse we saw above with $\\\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n---\n\nSo much for a repeat petiod of $3$, what about larger periods?\n\n**Claim:** For any positive whole numbers $r$ there are at least an infinitude of $\\\\sqrt{N}$ continued fractions having repeat period $r$ where $N$ is a whole number, having the following form:\n\n$\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[kP\\_r\\+1;\\\\overline{2,2,...,2,2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)}]$\n\n$P\\_r$ is a Pell number defined by $P\\_0\\=0,P\\_1\\=P\\_{\\-1}\\=1,P\\_r\\=2P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}\\\\text{ for } r\\\\ge 2$, and $k$ is a whole number $\\\\ge 0$ for $r\\=1$, $\\\\ge 1$ otherwise. The number of $2$ digits before the final entries is $r\\-1$.\n\nThe proof bears some similarities to calculating the general solution for $r\\=3$ above. First add $kP\\_r\\+1$ to the expression to make a purely periodic fraction:\n\n$x\\=kP\\_r\\+1\\+\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[\\\\overline{2(kP\\_r\\+1\\),2,2,...,2}]$\n\nThen\n\n$x\\=2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{\\[2,2,...,2,x]}$\n\nBy mathematical induction on $r$ and using the recursive relation defined for Pell numbers in the claim it is true that\n\n$\\[2,2,...,2,x]\\=\\\\dfrac{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}{P\\_{r\\-1}x\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}$\n\nwith $r\\-1$ digits of $2$ in the block. When this is substituted into the previous equation the following is obtained:\n\n$x\\=2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)\\+\\\\dfrac{P\\_{r\\-1}x\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}$\n\n$x\\=\\\\dfrac{(2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_r\\+P\\_{r\\-1})x\\+2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}$\n\n$(P\\_r)x^2\\-2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_rx\\-(2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2})\\=0$\n\nUpon completing the square and back\\-substituting $\\\\sqrt{N}\\=x\\-(P\\_rk\\+1\\)$ we obtain:\n\n$N\\=\\\\dfrac{(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2P\\_r\\+2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_r}$\n\nUsing the Pell number recursion to eliminate $P\\_{r\\-2}$:\n\n$N\\=\\\\dfrac{(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2P\\_r\\+2(kP\\_r)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_r}{P\\_r}\\=(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2\\+2kP\\_{r\\-1}\\+1$\n\nthereby identifying $N$ as a whole number. For a full fundamental period $\\\\ge 2$ the terminal element must not match the other elements, so in that case $k\\\\ge 1$.

In practice, this is usually not an issue as reference voltage circuits with enough ripple rejection can be made.\n\nAn opamp (used as an error amplifier) compares the output voltage (actually a divided\\-down version of the output voltage, \\\\$R\\_1\\\\$ and \\\\$R\\_2\\\\$ are a voltage divider).\n\nThe output of the opamp controls a transistor, Q2\\.\n\nIf the **opamp** is fast enough then it can control the transistor Q2 so well that it will be fast enough to respond to the voltage changes (ripple!) at \\\\$V\\_i\\\\$. It will respond in such a way that at \\\\$V\\_o\\\\$ there's as little left of the ripple as the loop can manage. In essence, the loop **compensates** for the ripple by controlling Q2 such that the ripple is **rejected**.\n\nIf you would do the proper loop analysis you would find that the ripple rejection depends on the **excess loop gain** inside the loop. For more information, [read this](https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/loop-gain-and-its-effect-on-analog-control-systems.html).\n\nSo with an opamp that is both fast enough and that has a high gain (for 120 Hz, that is not an issue, the gain will be quite high) we can achieve quite high ripple rejection.\n\nAt (much) higher frequencies that 120 Hz, like for example at 1 MHz, the opamp will not be fast enough and will have less gain meaning less ripple rejection. Fortunately we can then use capacitors to help us out. For 1 MHz these capacitors can have a relatively small value (a few uF) so size and cost is less of an issue. Also these capacitors are often needed to guarantee **stability** of the voltage regulator, without the input and output capacitors the voltage regulator might **oscillate** and generate a new ripple!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A voltage regulator IC like the LM7805 achieves high ripple rejection (73 dB at 120 Hz) primarily through:\n\nA) Large internal capacitors that filter out ripple\nB) A complex bandgap reference circuit\nC) An error amplifier and feedback loop that actively compensates for input voltage variations\nD) Multiple stages of LC filters inside the IC\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The high ripple rejection in voltage regulator ICs like the LM7805 is primarily achieved through an error amplifier (op-amp) and feedback loop system. This active compensation method allows the regulator to quickly respond to input voltage variations (ripple) and adjust the output accordingly. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the IC doesn't rely on large internal capacitors for filtering. \nOption B, while the bandgap reference is important for stable voltage reference, it's not the primary mechanism for ripple rejection. \nOption D is incorrect as the IC doesn't use multiple stages of LC filters internally.\n\nThe correct answer, C, describes the core mechanism: the error amplifier compares the output to a reference voltage and controls a transistor to maintain a stable output, effectively rejecting ripple from the input.

If this gets to be a lot of wires (sounds like 3 cables and 2 switches, so 5 total) it may be easier to use a [push\\-in connector](http://www.idealindustries.com/prodDetail.do?prodId=in-sure&div=0&l1=push-in) instead:\n\n![5 connector  push-in connector](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjoiR.jpg)\n\nor for 6 conductors:\n\n![6 conductor push-in connector](https://i.stack.imgur.com/72lwo.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a bathroom electrical box with two light switches, three neutral wires, three ground wires, and three black wires (one pigtailed to both switches), what is the correct method for grounding the switches in a plastic box?\n\nA) Connect the ground wires from the switches directly to the metal box, ignoring the existing ground wire bundle.\nB) Leave the existing ground wire bundle as is and don't connect the switches to any ground.\nC) Add a pigtail from each switch to the existing ground wire bundle, connecting all grounds together.\nD) Connect the ground wires from the switches to the neutral wire bundle for proper grounding.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct method is to add a pigtail from each switch to the existing ground wire bundle, connecting all grounds together. This ensures that all ground wires in the box are properly connected, including those from the switches. This maintains the integrity of the grounding system and provides proper safety. Option A is incorrect because the box is plastic, not metal. Option B is unsafe as it leaves the switches ungrounded. Option D is dangerous and incorrect, as it mixes neutral and ground wires, which should always be kept separate."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/27", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/32334", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 32334, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to say this?\n\n> 1.

From here why lambda is doing is it flatter the slope that makes me think what if it does the opposite thing. It increases the slope by change the lambda \\< 0, I know we don't do that in shrinkage so my question is can it be beneficial for lambda \\< 0 in some expansion instead of shrinkage?. Are there any case it can be applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To consider this, let's look at what the Lasso estimates of the coefficients is trying to minimize. Suppose $y\\_i$ is the outcome for observation $i\\=1,\\\\ldots,n$ and that $x\\_{ki}$ is the value of covariate $k\\=1,\\\\ldots,p$ for individual $i$. We are interested in estimating the vector of $p$ coefficients, $\\\\beta\\=\\\\beta\\_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\beta\\_p$ is a vector of $p$ coefficients, corresponding to the $p$ covariates they are coefficients for, as well as the intercept $\\\\beta\\_0$. Then the lasso estimate of $\\\\beta$ is \n\n$\\\\hat{\\\\beta}^{lasso} \\= \\\\underset{\\\\beta}{\\\\arg\\\\min}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\underset{i\\=1}{\\\\overset{n}{\\\\sum}}\\\\left( y\\_i \\- \\\\beta\\_0 \\- \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}}\\\\beta\\_k x\\_{ki}\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\lambda \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}} \\\\vert\\\\beta\\_k\\\\vert \\\\right\\\\}$, for some $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0\\.$.\n\nOne reason the lasso is used is due to the fact that highly correlated covariates lead to unstable estimates of their corresponding $\\\\beta$\\-coefficients, when estimated through ordinary least squares (OLS). For instance, if $X\\_1$ and $X\\_2$ are highly correlated, then the OLS estimates of $\\\\beta\\_1$ and $\\\\beta\\_2$ will vary a lot between samples. This leads to an inflated mean squared error in the estimates. Now, in lasso regression, since $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0$, we see that the coefficients are shrunk towards 0 since the penalty term \"punishes\" estimates that are very large. This is, in essence, why lasso can combat some of the problems of multicolinearity.\n\nBut what lappens if we force $\\\\lambda \\< 0$? Well, this is equivalent to continuing to let $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0$ and then minimize:\n\n$\\\\hat{\\\\beta}^{lasso} \\= \\\\underset{\\\\beta}{\\\\arg\\\\min}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\underset{i\\=1}{\\\\overset{n}{\\\\sum}}\\\\left( y\\_i \\- \\\\beta\\_0 \\- \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}}\\\\beta\\_k x\\_{ki}\\\\right)^2 \\- \\\\lambda \\\\underset{k\\=1}{\\\\overset{p}{\\\\sum}} \\\\vert\\\\beta\\_k\\\\vert \\\\right\\\\}$, for some $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 0\\.$.\n\n(Note the minus before the penalty term, where previously there was a plus.) Now we are instead encouraging the estimated coefficients to be as large as possible. My intuition is that this would be especially true for covariates that are independent of $y\\_i$. So by forcing $\\\\lambda \\< 0$, you would get the estimates of coefficients that are too far away from 0\\."}, "answer": "Question: Based on the explanation of Lasso regression and the effects of \u03bb, which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of a negative \u03bb value?\n\nA) Using a negative \u03bb would result in more stable coefficient estimates for highly correlated predictors.\n\nB) A negative \u03bb would encourage coefficient estimates to be as close to zero as possible.\n\nC) Applying a negative \u03bb would likely lead to inflated coefficient estimates, especially for predictors unrelated to the outcome.\n\nD) Negative \u03bb values are commonly used in Lasso regression to combat multicollinearity issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the passage, using a negative \u03bb value in Lasso regression would change the penalty term from addition to subtraction in the minimization problem. This effectively encourages the estimated coefficients to be as large as possible, rather than shrinking them towards zero. The passage specifically states that this effect would be \"especially true for covariates that are independent of y_i,\" meaning predictors unrelated to the outcome would likely have inflated coefficient estimates.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a negative \u03bb would actually destabilize estimates, not make them more stable. \n\nOption B is the opposite of what would happen with a negative \u03bb; it would encourage coefficients to be larger, not closer to zero. \n\nOption D is incorrect because negative \u03bb values are not commonly used in Lasso regression; the passage clearly states that \u03bb is typically greater than or equal to zero in standard Lasso regression."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/11", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/255083", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/138796/"], "docs_id": 255083, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Could someone show the process for browsing public games on Diablo 3 on the PC (via screen shots), as I have been trying for a while and cannot find it.

Then we bad block the disk.\n\n**fsck**\n\nAt the initramfs prompt, type:\n\n```\nfsck /dev/sda5\n\n```\n\n**NCQ**\n\nYou have NCQ disk errors.\n\nNative Command Queuing (NCQ) is an extension of the Serial ATA protocol allowing hard disk drives to internally optimize the order in which received read and write commands are executed.\n\nEdit `sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub` and change the following line to include this extra parameter. Then do `sudo update-grub` to write the changes to disk. Reboot. Monitor hangs, and watch `/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg` for continued error messages.\n\n```\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash libata.force=noncq\"\n\n```\n\n**badblock**\n\n* Note: do NOT abort a bad block scan!\n* Note: do NOT bad block a SSD\n* Note: backup your important files FIRST!\n* Note: this will take many hours\n* Note: you may have a pending HDD failure\n\nBoot to a Ubuntu Live DVD/USB in \u201cTry Ubuntu\u201d mode.\n\nIn `terminal`...\n\n```\nsudo fdisk -l # identify all \"Linux Filesystem\" partitions\n\n```\n\nsudo e2fsck \\-fcky /dev/sdXX \\# read\\-only test\n\nor\n\n```\nsudo e2fsck -fccky /dev/sda5 # non-destructive read/write test (recommended)\n\n```\n\nThe `-k` is important, because it saves the previous bad block table, and adds any new bad blocks to that table. Without `-k`, you loose all of the prior bad block information.\n\nThe `-fccky` means:\n\n```\n   -f    Force checking even if the file system seems clean.\n\n   -c    This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program to do\n         a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad blocks.\n         If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block\n         inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or direc\u2010\n         tory.  If this option is specified twice, then the bad block scan\n         will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.\n\n   -k    When combined with the -c option, any existing bad blocks in the\n         bad blocks list are preserved, and any new bad blocks found by\n         running badblocks(8) will be added to the existing bad blocks\n         list.\n\n   -y    Assume an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows e2fsck to be\n         used non-interactively.

On the one hand, the chances of you getting a real killer legendary from opening packs is very slim. But on the other, you need to accumulate a vast amount of dust and there is the awful chance of you aquiring a second and totally useless copy of the card.\n\nAt the moment I'm edging on using it to buy rares.

According to the documentation, prepending one or more spaces to a command in Bash will prevent that command from being saved in the command history. This can be particularly useful when entering commands that contain sensitive information like passwords.\n\nOption A is incorrect because appending a '#' symbol typically denotes a comment in Bash and doesn't affect command history.\n\nOption C, enclosing the command in quotation marks, doesn't prevent the command from being saved in history.\n\nOption D is incorrect as there is no standard 'no-history' flag in Bash for this purpose.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's knowledge of Bash command history behavior and a specific technique for maintaining privacy when entering sensitive commands."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/01", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/203770", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/101076/"], "docs_id": 203770, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to make it so what ever direction I look a specified entity looks in that direction as well.

Launchpad searches for applications in multiple locations, including the Applications folder in the user's Home directory (~\u2060/Applications) and the root Applications folder on the main drive. If an application exists in both locations, Launchpad will display an icon for each instance.

The solenoid is actuating at about 3 Hz.\n\nThe relay is good for a few million actuations. And then, it mysteriously stops working. Replacing the relay works, for another few million actuations. I conclude that the problem is not the transistor or the solenoid.\n\nThe nature of the failure is somewhat peculiar. At first, it appears to be a stuck closed failure; the relay will not open when the transistor is not driven. When power is removed from the relay, it then opens. When power is re\\-applied, the relay stays open, until the transistor drives it, at which point it becomes stuck closed again.\n\nI tested one of the \"dead\" relays. The coil exhibits the correct resistance, 250 ohm. The reed switch is also open.\n\nI would have expected this to be a failure where the contacts are welded together, but the fact that a \"dead\" relay is open and that it only sticks after it has first been energized lead me to believe there is something else going on. Does anyone have an explanation for this failure?\n\nEDIT: Addressing some comments\n\nUsing the reed relay because that's what we have already, this is a small one\\-off project. The relay is a Radio Shack relay, SPST 5VDC 20 mA nominal, rated for 500 mA 125 VAC/60VDC. I believe the equivalent relay (OMR\\-106H) can be found on digikey here [http://www.digikey.com/product\\-detail/en/OMR\\-106H,V000/PB886\\-ND/1095211](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/OMR-106H,V000/PB886-ND/1095211). The DC power supply for the solenoid (12V) shows about 400 mA peak current. The datasheet lists 5 million \"operations\" at 24V 400 mA. Two relays have now died around 3 million at 12V.\n\nThe diode is across the coil, not the switch. The literature I have read indicates that the diode is usually for the protection of whatever drives the reed relay's coil.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every relay has a life expectancy... they are not infinite. You are saying that at 3 hertz you activate it a few million times, that is a lot of activations for a relay.\n\nAs you have not provided a part number, for illustrative purposes, I have used a generic one. The datasheet of your relay should have a graph like this one...\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YX9eB.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, in this relay particularly, the maximum life operations it can have no more than a million and a half operations...\n\nThat type of failure is normal in relays because the contact material starts wearing away with normal operation, and if you operate at the maximum rated load, as you can see in the table, the relay will have no more than 30,000 operating cycles.\n\nI hope this information is clear enough."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is using a reed relay to control a solenoid, which actuates at 3 Hz. The relay fails after a few million actuations. When it fails, it appears to be stuck closed when energized, but opens when power is removed. What is the most likely cause of this failure mode?\n\nA) The transistor driving the relay is malfunctioning\nB) The flyback diode across the relay coil is faulty\nC) The contact material of the relay has worn away due to repeated operations\nD) The solenoid is drawing too much current and damaging the relay contacts\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the failure is the wear of the contact material in the relay due to repeated operations. This aligns with the information provided in the top answer, which explains that relays have a limited life expectancy based on the number of operations. The failure mode described (appearing stuck closed when energized, but opening when power is removed) is consistent with contact material degradation. The graph in the answer shows that even for a typical relay, the maximum life expectancy is around 1.5 million operations, which is in line with the \"few million actuations\" mentioned in the question. Options A and B are unlikely as the question states that replacing the relay temporarily solves the issue.

I suppose I may be looking for military, or naval terminology.\n\nFor example, if you were in a submarine, being buffeted by currents, so your vessel was being pushed sideways, how would you correctly say, \"we are being pushed east but we are facing north?\" Would it be correct to say \"we are bearing 0\u00b0, but our heading is 270\u00b0?\" It doesn't *sound* correct.\n\n**Edit**\n\nAs I note in a comment below: when I clumsily wrote that I was \"looking for two words to correctly assign to these physical components of a vehicle,\" what I meant was, single\\-word attributes to distinguish between the direction a vehicle was facing, and the actual direction the vehicle was moving in, voluntarily or not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Bearing** is regularly defined as the direction (relative to true north) in which your destination lies. If you could go in a straight line to your destination, this would be the most direct way of getting there.\n\nYou also have **relative bearing**, where the front of the vehicle is considered \"north\"; you'll see this when pilots claim, for example, that something is \"at your 3 o'clock\"; in naval terminology, port (left) and starboard (right) are always relative to the bow (front of the vessel).\n\n**Heading** is the direction your face/nose/front/bow is currently pointing at (relative to true north), assuming default movement by your vehicle's impulse mechanism is forward. If there are no obstacles between you and your destination, and nothing aside from your vehicle's own impulse mechanism is moving it, heading should always be equal to bearing.\n\n**Course** describes the entire planned route to get to your destination. A course correction implies that your planned route encountered an obstacle, and that you have to correct that plan.\n\nAs an example, let's assume a car is the vehicle, and it's navigating in a standard grid\\-like street structure. If you're at point (0, 0\\) with your car facing north and your destination is at (3, 3\\), your course would be \"Three blocks north, then three blocks east\". Your bearing at the start of your journey would be north\\-east, and your heading would be north, since that's the way your car is facing.\n\nAfter you travel three blocks north, you're stopped at a red light. You should plan to turn right, to change your heading to east, since your bearing is now east. Your remaining course is \"3 blocks east\".\n\nIn aviation, where winds can and often will push you off\\-course, heading is rarely equal to bearing when the total travel distance is large. This makes for frequent course corrections to account for wind.\n\nIn my opinion, **direction** is the most basic term of all, and describes a directed vector between two points.\n\nFor your example, it seems like the proper phrasing would be \"We are heading north, but we're being pushed off\\-course eastwards.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A submarine is navigating through strong ocean currents.

Course is the planned route, not the direction the submarine is facing. Bearing is the direction to the destination, not the direction of movement.\nD) Correct. Heading (0\u00b0) accurately describes the direction the submarine is facing (north), while the direction of movement (90\u00b0) correctly indicates the eastward push of the current.

It isn't quick and it takes a decent chunk of HDD space if you process a lot of files. As a note, the data I work with has fewer \"features\", more \"users\", and I use perl to process it.\n\nFirst off, I would not recommend storing the data together as a single matrix, since most programs (certainly R) will not be able to handle it. If you store each user as a separate file (.txt or whatever other format works better for you), you can then access them individually, even with R. \n\nThen, as a new document comes in, you will have to do 100,000 comparisons each between two vectors of length 10 million.\n\nHere's an example in R with two random binary vectors of length 10,000,000\\. \n\n```\nx=as.numeric(rnorm(10000000)<0)\n\ny=as.numeric(rnorm(10000000)<0)\n\nsim = crossprod(x,y)/sqrt(crossprod(x)*crossprod(y))  \n\n         [,1]\n[1,] 0.4999211\n\n```\n\nSince the two vectors in this example are random 0,1 vectors, they have a cosine similarity of 0\\.5\\. This one similarity (cosine sim) calculation took less than a second without me trying to optimize it. \n\nTo see how long your process would take, you could loop this code over 100,000 iterations and store each similarity result to a results vector that contains all its matches. I tried the above code with 1000 iterations and it took about 70 seconds.\n\nYou can also insert whatever similarity measure you desire.

A notable exception is the most celebrated result of recent years, the proof of Fermat's last theorem by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles in 1994 \\[...]\n> To complete his proof, Wiles assumed the existence of a type of large cardinal known as an inaccessible cardinal, technically overstepping the bounds of conventional arithmetic\"\n\nIs this true ?\nIf so, could someone please outline how they are used ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic contention here is that Wiles' work uses cohomology of sheaves on certain Grothendieck topologies, the general theory of which was first developed in Grothendieck's SGAIV and which requires the existence of an uncountable [Grothendieck universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_universe). It has since been clarified that the existence of such a thing is equivalent to the existence of an [inaccessible cardinal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal), and that this existence \\-\\- or even the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal! \\-\\- cannot be proved from ZFC alone, assuming that ZFC is consistent.\n\nMany working arithmetic and algebraic geometers however take it as an article of faith that in any use of Grothendieck cohomology theories to solve a \"reasonable problem\", the appeal to the universe axiom can be bypassed. Doubtless this faith is ~~predicated on~~ abetted by the fact that most arithmetic and algebraic geometers (present company included) are not really conversant or willing to wade into the intricacies of set theory. I have not really thought about such things myself so have no independent opinion, but I have heard from one or two mathematicians that I respect that removing this set\\-theoretic edifice is not as straightforward as one might think. (Added: here I meant removing it from *general constructions*, not just from applications to some particular number\\-theoretic result. And I wasn't thinking solely about the small etale site \\-\\- see e.g. the comments on crystalline stuff below.)\n\nHere is an article which gives more details on the matter:\n\n* Colin McLarty, *What does it take to prove Fermat\u2019s last theorem?

The relationship between Wiles' proof and inaccessible cardinals is subtle and somewhat controversial.

I'm trying to figure out exactly what the parameter ultimately controls. I know it adjusts how aggressively the kernel tries to swap out pages, but what decision making process in the kernel code does it affect?\n\nDoes it adjust how long ago a page must have been accessed before the kernel swaps it out? If so what does the default value of 60 represent? And how much is changed by a increment/decrement of 1 (a formula would be nice)?  \n\nOr does it swap out pages based on their access frequency?  \n\nOr something else?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since kernel version 2\\.6\\.28, Linux uses a [Split Least Recently Used](http://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign \"Page Replacement Design\") (LRU) page replacement strategy. Pages with a filesystem source, such as program text or shared libraries belong to the file cache. Pages without filesystem backing are called anonymous pages, and consist of runtime data such as the stack space reserved for applications etc. Typically pages belonging to the file cache are cheaper to evict from memory (as these can simple be read back from disk when needed). Since anonymous pages have no filesystem backing, they must remain in memory as long as they are needed by a program unless there is swap space to store them to. \n\nThe [`vm.swappiness`](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt \"Kernel tree documentation for /proc/sys/vm/*\") option comes into play in `get_scan_count()` defined in `mm/vmscan.c`. `get_scan_count()` determines how aggressively the anonymous and file LRU lists should be scanned when looking for pages to evict. The value of each case is is determined by the floating average of recently rotated and recently scanned ratios where more recent references have more weight than older ones in order take into account the changing workload of the system.\n\nThe `vm.swappiness` is a modifier that changes the balance between swapping out file cache pages in favour of anonymous pages. `vm.swappiness` is the priority value given to anonymous pages, [by default set to 60](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88693/why-is-swappiness-set-to-60-by-default/88820 \"Why is swappiness set to 60 by default?\"). The file cache is given an priority value of 200 from which the `vm.swappiness` modifier is deducted (`file_prio=200-anon_prio`). This means that, by default, the priority weights stand moderately in favour of anonymous pages (`anon_prio=60`, `file_prio=200-60=140`). However, when the system is close to an [out\\-of\\-memory condition](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87732/linux-reboot-out-of-memory/87769#87769 \"Linux reboot out of memory\"), the both anonymous and file LRU lists are scanned equally, unless `vm.swappiness` is set to zero. \n\nWhen `vm.swappiness` is set to 100, the priorities would be equal (`anon_prio=100`, `file_prio=200-100=100`). Setting `vm.swappiness` to zero will prevent the kernel from evicting anonymous pages in favour of pages from the file cache."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Linux kernel's page replacement strategy, what is the primary function of the vm.swappiness parameter?\n\nA) It directly controls how long a page must be inactive before being swapped out\nB) It determines the absolute number of pages that can be swapped out\nC) It modifies the priority balance between swapping out file cache pages and anonymous pages\nD) It sets a hard limit on the maximum amount of swap space that can be used\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The vm.swappiness parameter modifies the priority balance between swapping out file cache pages and anonymous pages. It acts as a priority value given to anonymous pages, which is then subtracted from a fixed value (200) to determine the priority for file cache pages. This affects how aggressively the kernel scans different types of pages when looking for pages to evict from memory. A higher vm.swappiness value increases the likelihood of anonymous pages being swapped out, while a lower value favors keeping anonymous pages in memory and swapping out file cache pages instead."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/26", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/266829", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/126861/"], "docs_id": 266829, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I die a lot because I don't trust my wands to be more helpful in clearing multiple monsters that surround me (magic traps and Rodney/summon nasties), and the useful ones are all beams and rays.

You are thinking that if you could somehow enumerate the digits after the decimal point, you could count them. But whether you use a string or any other mechanism, there is a fundamental problem: \n\n> how do you know when to stop counting?\n\nConverting the number to a string might sound like an easy solution, but that's only because someone else has already made this fundamental decision for you, and their choice has a rather slim chance of being the right choice for you. If you ask for a string representation of ***`\u03c0`*** (happy `\u03c0` day, by the way!) you will obviously get a finite length string, which might tempt you to believe that `\u03c0` has a finite number of digits.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, what you are trying to do will not work, because there are many numbers that cannot be accurately represented using either floats or doubles, so such numbers appear to contain meaningless decimal digits which only end there where the precision of the float or double ends. Please do try this at home: `printf( \"%.30f\\n\", 2.9f );` the result will be something funny, like `2.900000095367431640625000000000` or `2.899999999999999911182158029987`, or similar depending on your machine and compiler.\n\nAnd of course, this will easily manifest itself in calculations: if you divide `29` by `10` you will not really get `2.9`, but an approximation of it.\n\nSo, whatever you think you are going to accomplish by counting the decimal digits of a number will not work. You have some other kind of problem to solve, and you think that counting decimal digits will solve it, and you have come here to ask us how to implement your imaginary solution. This is a typical instance of asking an answer instead of asking a question.

According to the documentation, a PC in sleep mode consumes a small amount of power, estimated at around 12 watts. This power consumption is mainly for maintaining RAM contents.

How has this happened? I recently updated to Magento 2 and have been trying to get my head around the MSI but still can't figure out how salable quantity is more than quantity in the case of this and some other products.

You have upgraded to Magento 2\\.3 from the previous version of Magento where you had some orders placed, but not shipped. As since Magento 2\\.3 the stock deduction logic has changed drastically and now Magento places reservation at the time of Order placement (negative reservation) and then compensate it at the time of Shipment creation (positive reservation), you face the problem that Magento compensates the reservation which in fact was not created (because an order has been placed on older version of Magento.). You can read more about this here \\- [https://github.com/magento\\-engcom/msi/wiki/Salable\\-Quantity\\-Calculation\\-and\\-Mechanism\\-of\\-Reservations](https://github.com/magento-engcom/msi/wiki/Salable-Quantity-Calculation-and-Mechanism-of-Reservations)\n2. another reason for getting this issue is that you had Inventory Configuration Manage Stock \\= false. With this config option, Magento does not place a reservation at the time of order placement. But then you decided to switch Stock management On, and placing shipment you overcompensated with positive reservation (similar as case 1\\)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Magento 2 store owner notices that the salable quantity of some products is greater than their actual quantity after upgrading to Magento 2.3. What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The store owner accidentally entered incorrect inventory numbers during the upgrade process.\nB) There are unshipped orders from before the upgrade, and Magento 2.3's new stock reservation system is compensating for reservations that were never created.\nC) The Multi-Source Inventory (MSI) feature is malfunctioning and incorrectly calculating salable quantities.\nD) A third-party inventory management extension is conflicting with Magento's native inventory system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause is that there are unshipped orders from before the upgrade to Magento 2.3. In Magento 2.3 and later versions, the stock deduction logic changed significantly. The system now places a negative reservation when an order is placed and a positive reservation when a shipment is created. For orders placed in older versions of Magento, these reservations were not created at the time of order placement. When creating shipments for these old orders in the new system, Magento is compensating for reservations that never existed, leading to an inflated salable quantity.

By creating separate layout files for landscape and portrait orientations and placing them in the appropriate resource directories (\"res\\layout-land\" for landscape and \"res\\layout\" for portrait), the Android system will automatically choose the correct layout based on the device's orientation. This approach allows for fine-tuned control over the UI in both orientations, ensuring that all controls are visible and properly positioned regardless of how the device is held.\n\nOption A (using RelativeLayout) can be helpful for creating flexible layouts, but it doesn't address the specific needs of different orientations.\n\nOption C (using ScrollView) might help make all controls accessible, but it doesn't optimize the layout for different orientations and may result in a poor user experience.\n\nOption D (programmatically adjusting the layout) is possible but more complex and error-prone compared to using the built-in resource system for different orientations."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/01/06", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/153509", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/36225/"], "docs_id": 153509, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our redirects aren't working anymore \\- properply after updating to Magento 1\\.9\\.3\\.1\\.\n\nThe rewrites are still present in the URL Rewrites.

The ESP8266 issue is related to memory overflow.\n\nB) Triple quotes in PLY grammar rules indicate optional elements. The ESP8266 issue is caused by slow processing speed of the board.\n\nC) Triple quotes in PLY are used for docstrings to document grammar rules. The ESP8266 issue is due to network congestion during the initial handshake.\n\nD) Triple quotes in PLY allow for multiple production rules to be defined for a single function. The ESP8266 issue is caused by urequests not properly closing sockets after HTTP requests.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: In PLY, triple quotes are used to define multiple production rules for a single grammar function, allowing for more concise and readable code when a non-terminal can be produced in multiple ways. This is demonstrated in the example where 'expression' has multiple production rules defined in a single function.\n\nRegarding the ESP8266 issue, the documentation reveals that the problem was caused by urequests leaving sockets open after HTTP requests.

That device, which is powered by a 9V battery, has a step\\-up circuit to raise the battery voltage to \\+\\- 160V which, in turn, charges a 330uF capacitor. As soon as a command is received from the base, the capacitor is discharged over the solenoid through a relay.\n\nMy concern here is about safety when the shoot is aborted after the capacitor is already charged. I'd like the capacitor to be discharged (not through the solenoid, of course) in a brief time span (let\u00b4s say 30s max), to minimize the risk of an accidental shoot in the case of a circuit failure.\n\nAn obvious choice would be a bleeding resistor in parallel with the capacitor. But to have it discharged in 30s, its value would be:\n\n$$\nR \\= {t \\\\over 5 \\\\times C} \\\\implies\nR \\= {30 \\\\over 5 \\\\times 0\\.00033} \\\\implies\nR \\\\cong 18,182 \\\\Omega\n$$\n\nUsing a resistor with this value would permanently drain:\n\n$$\nI \\= {V \\\\over R} \\\\implies\nI \\= {160 \\\\over 18182} \\\\implies\nI \\\\cong 0\\.009 A\n$$\n\nDue to the step\\-up configuration (which is raising input voltage about 20 times) the input current, in this case, would be \\\\$ 20 \\\\times 0\\.009 \\= 180 mA\\\\$. That much energy would have to be drained only to \"feed\" the bleeding resistor. Considering all the other circuit needs, and the fact that the whole device is powered by a 9V battery, that seens a little too much.\n\nMy next, not so obvious choice, was to connect the bleeding resistor through the NC terminal of another relay, which should be kept open during the capacitor charge. Naturally, that would be power consuming too, but much less than the bleeding resistor being connected directly to the capacitor. Plus, got the bonus of having it being discharged even quicker because, in this case, I could use even smaller resistors.\n\nIn fact, I've assembled a prototype to test this concept and... it failed. Actually, the circuit worked as expected, but a single battery was not enough to power it and I've had to use two batteries in parallel, otherwise, when that additional relay was closed, the voltage supplied dropped so much that the Arduino Nano, which was managing all the fuzz, simply rebooted (forgot to mention his presence before).\n\nTrying to reduce the power drain I disable all the LEDs and adjusted the radio module (a EBYTE LoRa E32\\-91520T) to the minimum transmission power possible, with no success.\n\nMy next choice is to use a solid\\-state device, instead of the relay. That could be a Form B (NC) SSR relay, but they are impossible to find where I live (can\u00b4t find them even on the Internet). Meanwhile I was doing that research I became aware of the Depletion mode MOSFETS, which at first glance should do what I want. Here comes the problem: I did tons of research over the Internet and couldn\u00b4t find a way to wire it up to behave like that, especially because it needs a gate voltage inferior to the Source's voltage to keep it closed. In a matter of fact, there is not so much information about those MOSFETs available, usually more theretical stuff than practical applications.\n\nSo, I've tried to simulate their use on the computer, in dozens of different configurations, even using a pair of then back to back (as I discovered they are used in SSR Form B relays), with no success. Sometimes they even worked closer to the way I expected but the current drain to keep the channel open was bigger than the original relay needed.\n\nI do really feel that the answer to that dilemma is quite simple, just lurking around some corner, so I'm asking the experts for some clarification on that. If the use of a depletion MOSFET is not the best solution here, let me know as well.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is the (almost) full schematic:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJnCi.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJnCi.png)\n\nThe blue squared area is a continuity test. When the user presses a button connecting TEST\\+ and TEST\\-, LED\\_TEST will turn on if there is continuity on the solenoid (which is plugged on OUT\\+ and OUT\\- binding posts). This part of the circuit is powered directly by the battery (the 9V\\_RAW power line).\n\nThe rest of the circuit is the step\\-up boost converter (to the left) and the output relays (to the right).\n\nThe boost converter is switched by Arduino PWM pin 3 (which is configured to 31372\\.55 Hz). The relays are triggered by Arduino's 5 and 7 digital pins.\n\nR6FB and R6FB2 pair is a voltage divider to feedback the output voltage to Arduino\u00b4s analog pin 0\\. Obviously, they could also work as a bleeding resistor, but I had to choose that high value (1MOhm) due to the current constraints I've mentioned above.\n\nThe RELAY and RELAY2 subcircuits are like the following:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZ3CH.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZ3CH.png)\n\nBTW, the relay contacts translate as NF \\= NC and NA \\= NO.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consumer products such as power supplies are not designed to last all that long, and especially are not designed to withstand wide temperature variations (in particular to start or work at low temperatures and not to self\\-destruct at high temperatures). They are often not supplied in housings suitable for industrial use. In some cases (though this does not necessarily apply to power supplies) they have a short design life compared to the expected decade or two for an industrial product.\n\nYou could certainly use an ATX supply in an industrial design if you are willing to work around those problems. I know of military products that use consumer innards and are ruggedized by adding housings and expensive connectors. Naturally the price goes up by an order of magnitude or more.\n\nBrick power supplies are not made in the same quantity as consumer supplies, nor are they subject to the same competitive pressures, but they tend to benefit from the economies of scale in consumer products, otherwise they would be **much** more expensive than they are."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a power supply for an industrial application.

This might involve adding appropriate housings, addressing temperature issues, and accounting for potentially shorter lifespans.

But many of the same concerns ultimately apply: does an object have the desired methods and attributes? Do those attributes have valid, in\\-range values? \n\nWhether you're writing constraints in code, or writing test cases, or validating user input, or just debugging, inevitably *somewhere* you'll need to verify that an object is still in a proper state\\-\\-that it still \"looks like a duck\" and \"quacks like a duck.\"\n\nIn statically typed languages you can simply declare \"`int x`\", and anytime you create or mutate `x`, it will always be a valid `int`. **It seems feasible to decorate a Python object to ensure that it is valid under certain constraints, and that every time that object is mutated it is *still* valid under those constraints.** Ideally there would be a simple declarative syntax to express \"hasattr length and length is non\\-negative\" (not in those words. Not unlike Rails validators, but less human\\-language and more programming\\-language). You could think of this as ad\\-hoc interface/type system, or you could think of it as an ever\\-present object\\-level unit test.\n\n**Does such a library exist to declare and validate constraint/duck\\-checking on Python\\-objects?** Is this an unreasonable tool to want? :)\n\n(Thanks!)\n\n---\n\nContrived example:\n\n```\nrectangle = {'length': 5, 'width': 10}\n\n# We live in a fictional universe where multiplication is super expensive.  \n# Therefore any time we multiply, we need to cache the results.\n\ndef area(rect):\n    if 'area' in rect:\n        return rect['area']\n    rect['area'] = rect['length'] * rect['width']\n    return rect['area']\n\nprint area(rectangle)\nrectangle['length'] = 15\nprint area(rectangle) # compare expected vs. actual output!\n\n# imagine the same thing with object attributes rather than dictionary keys.\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Today, python offers a wide spectrum of tests than can be done for testing duck\\-type coding.\n\nType Annotations\n================\n\nImplementations\n---------------\n\nFor starters, static, compile time type\\-checking ability was added to Python 3 in 2015\\.\n\nNow, there are multiple third\\-party libraries that provide an implementations for the new type\\-checking hooks.\n\n1. [MyPy](http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html \"MyPy\") \u2014 data type\\-checking only (fulfills Python 3 type annotation capability)\n2. [PyContracts](https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/ \"PyContracts\") \u2014 same Python 3 type as in MyPy above, plus allows conjunctive value constraint(s), which is like what you are talking about.\n\nMyPy is pretty slick.\n\nIt even supports [overloaded](http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/function_overloading.html \"overloaded\") function parameter constraints, so that a function can have different return value type if it takes different parameter value types, for instance, using @overload decorator.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nIf in your example above, 'length' and 'width' values were passed as discrete parameters, like:\n\n```python\ndef area(length: 'int,>0', width: 'int,>0') -> int:\n    pass\n\n```\n\nthen, PyContracts could easily do individual type/value checks.\n\nPyContracts can work with the dictionary you specified too, as\\-is.\n\n```python\ndef area(rect: 'dict(str: int)') -> int:\n    pass\n\n```\n\n---\n\nProblems with PyDBC\n-------------------\n\nThough it was slick for its time, nowadays, the drawbacks I see with [PyDBC](http://www.nongnu.org/pydbc/) are:\n\n1. There is a slight performance hit to running these precondition/postcondition tests. They're dynamic, run time tests. Python 3 type annotations are done using static analysis.\n2. Rewriting code at runtime, for one purpose, in a one\\-off way, that is scattered throughout your program, can be too brittle to be worth the bargain. Works fine with one use. What if some other technique/tool does that too? One can get into conflicts where the only way to get out of them is to drop one tool or another after depending upon it a long time. Cleaner ways to do this have evolved for Python since PyDBC was invented.\n3. Explicit declarative constructs, like Python function decorators and Python 3 type annotations, are going to be instantly recognizable/understood by any programmer familiar with Python. They won't spot the implicitly invoked functions. Once they are told, they may forget, may copy or rename the primary function and forget the precondition/postcondition sidekicks. Automated tools are going to treat those extra 2 functions as independent, when they intent is that they are not.\n4. The **metaclass** *attribute* feature of Python 2 no longer works in Python 3\\. It is ignored. Instead, metaclass\\= is specified in class declarations in Python 3\\. Nowadays, new projects start in Python 3 and Python 2 is legacy.\n5. Python 3 has reworked the type system slightly going from early Python 2 to recent Python 3\\. A Python 2 metaclass\\-based solution may not work with Python 3 without rewriting/retesting it.\n6. Metaclasses are not module\\-wide now, can only be specified per class, and there can only be one metaclass per class. So it is a preciously applied feature of a class.\n\n---\n\nUnit Testing\n============\n\nTo take things farther, into the realm of checking post\\-conditions, which is appropriate for testing in the fashion of TDD or BDD, one might be better off writing unit tests\u2014particularly if the desire is to test side effects.\n\nTDD unit tests with unittest\n----------------------------\n\nPython comes with a unittest package that works fine for verifying external behavior effects of a class are correct.\n\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>\n\nIt's very handy to use. If you want to test all of your boundary cases (like dimensions\\<\\=0\\), normal case, and any exceptions it supports in the future, it's the right place for it.\n\nBDD testing\n-----------\n\nThere are some third\\-party programming tools for BDD (behavior\\-driven design). Which ones are popular/supported will probably change over time.\n\nIn my opinion, BDD test scenarios tend to be easier to read/understand. They're readable, possibly even slightly extendable, by non\\-Python programmers. The step language is pretty simple.\n\ndoctest comments/tool\n---------------------\n\nAlternatively, one could include executable examples in the area function's doc string and test it by running doctest\u2014a standard feature of Python for far more than a decade.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest>\n\nBy using doctest, tests would be part of the documentation, inline and generated, as both useful examples and convenient tests.\n\nThose are appropriate ways to check that external state/logic of the function is working properly, given fully met preconditions. They tend to offer different side benefits as well.\n\n---\n\nDecorators\n==========\n\nOne can also use Python 3 decorators to declare preconditions and post conditions. The @precondition would be checked on entry. The @postcondition would be checked on exit.\n\nThis would allow you to enforce design by contract (DBC) with very little code at all.\n\nTo illustrate this listing 10, the @require decorator sample function, in this Dr. Dobb's magazine article, which shows how to implement a powerfully declarative, yet fully reusable, precondition\\-checking decorator in just 10 lines of regular Python code.\n\n[http://www.drdobbs.com/web\\-development/python\\-24\\-decorators/184406073](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/python-24-decorators/184406073)\n\nYou could write a post condition verification decorator based on this @require example, and name them @precondition and @postcondition.\n\nJust be careful. The example uses eval, and there is no parameter sanity\\-checking or constraining, so someone might put something. Really awkward. Of course, that's a possibility other places as well, but I feel like I should raise awareness since eval/exec uses should always kept in mind as a concern.\n\n---\n\nPython 3 includes a library called **functools** that actually offers 2 capabilities handy for your problem.\n\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html>\n\n1. It has a decorator that provides a LRU (least recently used) cache for memoization of a decorated function's return values: @functools.lru\\_cache\n2. It eases writing decorator functions.\n\nOn the 1st point, that strikes your need to test the memoization feature; supplied, pretested functionality. Memoization is a very handy efficiency tool. In addition to reusing existing code, using lru\\_cache decorator is going to make your area function much more transparent.\n\nAnyone would be able to see that there is memoization (results caching) going on, without needing to read all of its source code, just by seeing the lru\\_cache decorator. They would know it's tested code too, not some embedded, one\\-off logic.\n\nFor the second, if you needed something more robust, complex, or implementation specific than the Dr. Dobb's example, functools may speed your efforts. \n\nParticularly, you should look at the **@functools.wraps** decorator. It not only saves a couple of lines of code, but makes the metadata more intuitively correct an useful.\n\n---\n\nError\\-Proofing\n===============\n\nThe following suggestions made above will make the example correct, less error\\-prone as\\-is not to mention if modified, easier to read/understand its usage and behavior, well\\-tested.\n\n* Removing the area result\\-caching from the rect: dict parameter gets rid of calculation/state error. Replacing it with the standard library's @functools.lru\\_cache decorator has none of the drawbacks and virtually all of the benefits. The performance savings is still there. A function should do one thing, and do it well. Callers could store the value returned by the lru\\_cache memoized area function in an object if desired. In fact, an object could store it in an instance variable. It could even do so in a property read by a getter, fulfilling the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle. So nothing good is being lost or precluded by extracting the memoization, making it an extrinsic quality. Separation of concerns is key to designing good, reusable, reliable, testable functions.\n* For generic handling, like record\\-processing, a dict (or tuple/obj) makes sense. For something like this, explicit/discrete parameters are more easily understood/tested because they're self\\-documenting. The new type annotation syntax is simple \\& efficient for authors to read/change anytime, and tools to verify when developers feel like it.\n* Docstring with doctest compatible examples and unittest test cases will make sure the function works, and stays working.\n* Writing @precondition and @postcondition decorators is easy to do and can make the code more readable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following combinations of Python features and tools would be most effective for implementing type checking, constraint validation, and result caching for a function that calculates the area of a rectangle?\n\nA) Using a dictionary to store rectangle dimensions and area, with manual checks inside the function\n\nB) Utilizing @functools.lru_cache for memoization, type annotations for parameters, and unittest for testing\n\nC) Implementing a custom metaclass for attribute validation and PyDBC for design by contract\n\nD) Applying doctest for examples, PyContracts for type and value constraints, and a hand-written decorator for caching\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption A is inefficient and error-prone, as it mixes concerns and doesn't leverage Python's built-in features for type checking or caching.\n\nOption B is the most effective combination:\n- @functools.lru_cache provides efficient memoization without modifying the function's core logic\n- Type annotations allow for static type checking and improve code readability\n- unittest is a robust framework for thorough testing of the function's behavior\n\nOption C relies on outdated techniques.

Magnetic dipoles, such as bar magnets, behave analogously to electric dipoles.

This explanation best captures the relationship between magnetic and electric phenomena, highlighting the parallel behavior of dipoles in both cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because magnetic monopoles have not been observed in nature, and the behavior of magnets is not due to individual magnetic charges but to dipole interactions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the attraction between opposite magnetic poles is not unique and has clear parallels in electrostatics with dipole interactions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while magnetic and electric fields have some differences, their dipole behaviors show striking similarities that are important for understanding electromagnetic phenomena."}}
