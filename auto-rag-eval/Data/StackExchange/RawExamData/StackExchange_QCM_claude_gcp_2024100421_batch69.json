If I add `-serial`, it does not show on `info qtree` and the kernel boot messages only find one:\n\n```\n9000000.pl011: ttyAMA0 at MMIO 0x9000000 (irq = 54, base_baud = 0) is a PL011 rev1\n\n```\n\nIs it possible, and if not, is there a specific design reason for that?\n\nI'm on QEMU v3\\.0\\.0\\. From the source it does not seem possible: [https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/v3\\.0\\.0/hw/arm/virt.c\\#L138](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/v3.0.0/hw/arm/virt.c#L138) as there is only one UART in the memory map:\n\n```\n[VIRT_GIC_REDIST] =         { 0x080A0000, 0x00F60000 },\n[VIRT_UART] =               { 0x09000000, 0x00001000 },\n[VIRT_RTC] =                { 0x09010000, 0x00001000 },\n\n```\n\nI'm doing this because I'm trying to see if connecting from a different serial will make KGDB work. On x86\\_64 I can connect to `ttyS0`, but I thought it was worth giving this a try on ARM.

This can be seen from several key aspects of the patch:\n\n1. It modifies the memory map to include additional UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) entries (VIRT_UART1, VIRT_UART2, VIRT_UART3).\n\n2. It updates the interrupt mapping to assign unique interrupts to the new UART devices.\n\n3. The patch modifies the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) tables to include information about the additional serial ports.\n\n4. It extends the create_uart function to handle the new UART devices.\n\n5. In the machvirt_init function, it adds calls to create_uart for the new serial ports.\n\nThese changes collectively enable the ARM virt board in QEMU to support multiple serial ports, which was the limitation mentioned in the original user query. The other options (GPU acceleration, new network interface, and memory management) are not directly addressed by this patch."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/27", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1674498", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/273394/"], "docs_id": 1674498, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We need to solve this limit $\\\\lim \\_{x\\\\to \\\\infty \\\\:}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\left(2x\\\\right)!\\\\right)}{x^xx!}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{x}}$\n we guess that the answer is 1, as n approach infinity 1/n \\=\\> 0 so anything besides 0 to the power of 0 \\= 1 (except 0 of course).\n\nWe need to ensure if we had the right answer, please write some hints here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $$\n\\\\lim \\_{x\\\\to \\\\infty \\\\:}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\left(2x\\\\right)!\\\\right)}{x^xx!}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{x}}\n$$\nUsing Stirling's approximation\n$$\n(2x)!\n\\\\sim (2x/e)^{2x}\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi x}$$\nand\n$$\nx!\\\\sim (x/e)^x\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi x}\n$$\ntherefore the ratio $$\\\\frac{(2x)!}{x!}\\\\sim 2^{2 x\\+\\\\frac{1}{2}} e^{\\-x} x^x$$\nand dividing by $x^x$, we have to compute the limit\n$$\n\\\\lim\\_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}(2^{2 x\\+\\\\frac{1}{2}} e^{\\-x})^{1/x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{e}\\\\lim\\_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}(2^{2 x\\+\\\\frac{1}{2}} )^{1/x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{e}\\\\lim\\_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{1}{x}(2x\\+1/2\\)\\\\log 2}\\=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\log 4}}{e}\\=\\\\frac{4}{e}\\\\ .\n$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given limit problem:\n\nQuestion: Consider the limit:\n\nlim_{x\u2192\u221e} ((2x)! / (x^x * x!))^(1/x)\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The limit equals 1 because as x approaches infinity, the expression inside the parentheses approaches 0, and 0^0 = 1.\n\nB) The limit equals 4/e, which can be derived using Stirling's approximation for factorials.\n\nC) The limit does not exist because the expression inside the parentheses grows too rapidly as x approaches infinity.\n\nD) The limit equals e/4, which is the reciprocal of the correct answer due to a sign error in the exponent.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B.

That means that the whole string `00001803-494c-4f47-4943-544543480000` has to be part of the advertisement data. If there is no device found, but if it works for `1803`, it seems that only `1803` is broadcasted by the devices as service information.\n\nPlease check the advertisement data of the devices. If they only expose the 16\\-bit UUID, you have found the reason for the problem.\n\nRemember that advertisement data is limited to a length of 31 bytes, and this is further reduced by the length and data type declarations for each item.

What is the most likely reason for this behavior?\n\nA) The Core Bluetooth framework doesn't support 128-bit UUIDs for scanning.\nB) The peripheral devices are not correctly implementing the BLE protocol.\nC) The peripheral devices are only broadcasting 16-bit UUIDs in their advertisement data to conserve space.\nD) The scanForPeripherals method is being used incorrectly in the iOS app.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In BLE, advertisement data is limited to 31 bytes, which includes length and data type declarations for each item. To conserve space in this limited payload, it's common for devices to broadcast only 16-bit UUIDs instead of full 128-bit UUIDs. When the iOS app scans using the full 128-bit UUID, it doesn't find matches because the peripherals are only advertising the shorter 16-bit version. This explains why scanning works with the 16-bit UUID \"1803\" but not with the full UUID \"00001803-494c-4f47-4943-544543480000\". \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Core Bluetooth does support 128-bit UUIDs. \nAnswer B is unlikely, as the devices are discoverable when using the correct UUID format. \nAnswer D is also incorrect, as the method is being used correctly, but the mismatch is in the advertised vs. scanned UUID formats."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/03", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/274026", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/156333/"], "docs_id": 274026, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a huge file in which I want to look for a word, say **`pattern`**.

The admin has confirmed that iptables-persistent and netfilter-persistent are installed, and the rules are saved in /etc/iptables/rules.v4. However, upon reboot, the custom rules are missing. After investigation, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The netfilter-persistent service is failing to start during boot\nB) The custom rules are being overwritten by ufw or firewalld\nC) An old configuration file in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ is restoring a different set of rules\nD) The rules in /etc/iptables/rules.v4 are improperly formatted\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The system administrator discovered an old file named /etc/iptables.firewall.rules, which was being used to restore iptables rules via a script in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/firewall. This script was executing iptables-restore with the old ruleset, effectively overwriting the rules set by iptables-persistent/netfilter-persistent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the logs show that the netfilter-persistent service started successfully during boot.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the question states that ufw and firewalld are not installed on the system.\n\nOption D is unlikely because if the rules were improperly formatted, they wouldn't work even when manually restarting the netfilter-persistent service.\n\nThis scenario highlights the importance of checking for legacy configurations when troubleshooting iptables persistence issues, especially on systems that have been upgraded or reconfigured over time."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/23", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/427861", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/30526/"], "docs_id": 427861, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm having trouble finding a tool that does this for my friend (without designing it myself).

We're using a PIC32 board with an MCP4706 8\\-bit DAC, controlled over I2C. If we write a binary value (e.g. 0b00000100\\) to the DAC, it outputs as expected. However, we're trying to incrementally change the voltage output by the DAC, which goes into a voltage follower controlling a MOSFET that allows current to flow from a high\\-current source into a battery. \n\nHere's a schematic of all that. It's not perfect, but it gets out point across.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FerIG.jpg)\n\nAn analog pin measures the value output by a current sensor in\\-line with the battery, which controls the current flow, essentially. Currently, our conversion between voltage and current is done arbitrarily, which is okay.

The DAC expects an 8-bit value, which corresponds to an integer from 0 to 255. There's no need for decimal to binary conversion or string manipulation. The code should simply increment or decrement an integer variable (like 'shift' in the provided code) based on the desired voltage change, ensure it stays within the 0-255 range, and then send this value directly to the DAC using the I2C protocol.

Example of what I mean is below:\n\n<https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples>\n\nLook how it slides **BOTH** left **and** right very naturally depending on what tab you are on.\n\nThis has to be dynamic, because the tabs will be added at runtime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Today things are a bit simpler because new animation aliases exist as **:increment** and **:decrement**. Aliases have been introduced in Angular 5\\.\n\nSo my modified solution is:\n\n```\n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-workspace-container',\n      templateUrl: './workspace-container.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./workspace-container.component.scss'],\n      animations: [\n        trigger('animRoutes', [\n          transition(':increment', right),\n          transition(':decrement', left),\n        ]),\n      ],\n  })\n  export class ComponentContainingRouterOutlet implements OnDestroy, OnInit {\n    //... ngOnInit,ngOnDestroy\n\n    constructor( private route: ActivatedRoute ) { }\n\n    animationState: number;\n\n    onActivate($event) {\n      this.animationState = this.route.firstChild.snapshot.data['routeIdx'];\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n\nCall animation at router\\-outlet position:\n\n```\n<div [@animRoutes]=\"animationState\">\n  <router-outlet (activate)=\"onActivate($event)\"></router-outlet>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nmodify routes definition as example, look at `data: { routeIdx: X }` :\n\n```\n    const routes: Routes = [\n      {\n        path: 'routeOne',\n        component: ComponentOne,\n        data: { routeIdx: 0 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeTwo',\n        component: ComponentTwo,\n        data: { routeIdx: 1}\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeThree',\n        component: ComponentThree,\n        data: { routeIdx: 2 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'routeFour',\n        component: ComponentFour,\n        data: { routeIdx: 3 }\n      },\n      {\n        path: '',\n        redirectTo: 'routeOne',\n        pathMatch: 'full'\n      }\n    ]\n\n```\n\nAnd transitions are the same as in [Dolan's](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49590255/6804292) post:\n\n```\nconst left = [\n    query(':enter, :leave', style({ position: 'fixed', width: '100%' }), { optional: true }),\n    group([\n        query(':enter', [style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n        query(':leave', [style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(100%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n    ]),\n];\n\nconst right = [\n    query(':enter, :leave', style({ position: 'fixed', width: '100%' }), { optional: true }),\n    group([\n        query(':enter', [style({ transform: 'translateX(100%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n        query(':leave', [style({ transform: 'translateX(0%)' }), animate('.3s ease-out', style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)' }))], {\n            optional: true,\n        }),\n    ]),\n];\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Angular router animation documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an Angular application, you want to implement bidirectional slide animations for route transitions, similar to the Material tabs example.

It uses the `:increment` and `:decrement` animation aliases, which were introduced in Angular 5. These aliases allow the animation to determine the direction based on the route index, enabling both left and right slides depending on the navigation direction. This approach is dynamic and works well with tabs or routes that may be added at runtime. Options A and B do not provide bidirectional functionality, while option D, although it defines a slide animation, doesn't use the increment/decrement aliases for determining direction dynamically."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/04", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/318442", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/96904/"], "docs_id": 318442, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I do the following in nginx?\n\nI have a website hosted on example.com/id/44, I want to have my domainname test.com linked to that url.

Which of the following statements accurately describes the limitations of Nginx in this scenario?\n\nA) Nginx can perform this redirection easily using only the rewrite directive in the server block.\nB) Nginx can accomplish this task, but it requires a combination of proxy_pass and sub_filter directives.\nC) Nginx cannot perform this redirection as it's unable to rewrite across different hostnames.\nD) Nginx can do this redirection, but it requires a separate module to be installed and configured.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C. According to the documentation, Nginx cannot perform rewrites across different hostnames. It can only rewrite the URI part of the URL. In this scenario, the developer wants to redirect from one domain (test.com) to a specific path on another domain (example.com/id/44) while maintaining the appearance of the original domain in the browser's address bar. This kind of redirection, which involves changing the hostname while preserving the original URL display, is beyond Nginx's capabilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the rewrite directive alone cannot achieve the desired result across different domains.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even a combination of proxy_pass and sub_filter cannot solve the cross-domain rewrite issue in this case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no standard Nginx module that can overcome this limitation.

For the same reason I suppose we also cannot observe the horizon moving: everything happening on the horizon takes an eternity to witness from the outside perspective.\n\nTherefore, would a moving black hole result in new horizons (almost) forming according to an outside observer? The initial horizon would remain frozen in time, followed by the horizons around the moving singularity. Meaning, would moving black holes leave a trail of blackness behind, everywhere it passed?\n\nAn important issue here is the moving reference frames. Could one really claim that there is a perspective where the observer moved, rather than the black hole? The observer isn't curving spacetime to extremes, while spacetime is a medium: it's a fabric, it seems more than something described by coordinate systems.\n\nEdit:\nI changed the question title, it used to be \"Moving reference frame of a black hole\" but the new title better suits my question.

Therefore you can't have a frame of reference big enough to surround a black hole.\n\nSo a better way to phrase this question would be in terms of a moving observer. No, a moving observer cannot observe the horizon. The definition of the horizon is that causal curves from the horizon cannot reach outside events, and this definition precludes any external observer from observing the horizon. This definition is independent of the state of motion of an observer, and is independent of any choice of coordinates.\n\n> Because of time dilation we cannot observe a black hole forming in a finite amount of time.\n\nIt's not really because of time dilation, it's simply because the definition of a horizon is that it's something you can't observe (the boundary of an externally unobservable region of spacetime)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to general relativity, why can't an external observer directly observe the event horizon of a black hole?\n\nA) Due to extreme time dilation near the event horizon\nB) Because the observer's reference frame is moving relative to the black hole\nC) The event horizon is defined as the boundary beyond which events cannot affect an external observer\nD) Black holes leave a trail of darkness that obscures the horizon\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In general relativity, the event horizon is defined as the boundary of the region from which causal curves (paths of light and matter) cannot reach external events. This definition inherently means that an external observer cannot directly observe the horizon, regardless of their state of motion or choice of coordinates.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while time dilation is extreme near a black hole, it's not the fundamental reason for the unobservability of the horizon.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the inability to observe the horizon is independent of the observer's state of motion.\n\nAnswer D is a misconception.

That said, the second sentence does sound more natural with the preposition shifted. The reason is simply that the preposition's object (the pronoun *which*) is already present, so it is typical to place the preposition in front of that: *\"He has no pen **with which** he can write.\"* In the first sentence, the object of the preposition is implied, and to shift the preposition you would have to add it.

D1/D2 will switch on, only if something goes wrong. D1 and D2 are normal silicon diodes, which you should select for low leakage current.\n\nThe schematic editor used 1N4148 but according to datasheet, leakage is quite high. You could try [1N3595](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/308/1N3595-1118202.pdf) which has much lower leakage. I selected a thru\\-hole part on purpose, because it's easier to have low leakage with thru\\-hole due to the wider pin spacing...\n\nC1 provides some lowpass filtering, if needed. If not remove R5/C1\\.\n\nNote this will only be fully protected against a short across R1 if R3 is able to withstand 1kV without arcing or burning, or if the supply shuts off due to over current, etc. \n\nIf your 1kV supply is only able to output a few mA, then the diodes D2\\-D3 will protect your micro's ADC, but R2/R3 would arc and die. Not very expensive parts, so your choice to overdesign or not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circuit designer wants to measure very small currents (0.1nA to 500\u00b5A) in a high-voltage (1kV) DC circuit using an Arduino. They propose using an INA219 current sensor, but it only works up to 26V with 0.8mA resolution. To address this, they suggest using a voltage divider and a current amplification method. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) A Darlington pair is the ideal solution for amplifying the small currents in this circuit to a measurable range for the INA219 sensor.\n\nB) The proposed voltage divider solution with high-value resistors is sufficient to bring the voltage down to a safe level for the INA219, without need for current amplification.\n\nC) A circuit using an op-amp as a current-to-voltage converter, followed by protective diodes and a voltage divider, would be a more suitable approach for this measurement task.\n\nD) The INA219 sensor can be directly connected to the high-voltage circuit if a series resistor is added to limit the current to its 0.8mA maximum.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to use an op-amp as a current-to-voltage converter, followed by protective diodes and a voltage divider. This solution addresses several key issues:\n\n1. It allows measurement of very small currents by converting them to a proportional voltage.\n2. It provides isolation from the high-voltage source.\n3. It includes protective measures (diodes) to safeguard the Arduino's ADC.\n4. It scales the voltage to a range suitable for the Arduino's ADC.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a Darlington pair is not suitable for amplifying such small currents and doesn't address the high-voltage issue.

However, you are now combining some impossible things.\n\nLandsat images are projected in a rectangular grid, so around the globe they have different projections. Therefore, the masking of pixels is only possible correctly on an relatively small area on the globe where the projection is similar.\nBesides, you are making a composite median image. Making a composite will get rid of masked pixels, because only unmasked pixels are taken into the composite image.\nFurthermore, a composite image will blend pixels in the collection together, and therefore a composite image does not have a region specific projection, which explains why in your second image the masked pixels are not well aligned.\n\nI will give you two options to perform this operation;\n\n**Option 1:** Randomly mask pixels on a per image basis, and do not make the composite \n\nNote that this solution work perfectly for every image you will show on the screen, and is the desired solution if you have a location of interest which falls completely inside a Landsat image tier.\n\n```js\n// Function to randomly mask pixels in an image on a per-image basis\nfunction randomMask(image) {\n  // add random mask on a per image basis with reprojection\n  var random = ee.Image.random().select('random').gt(0.2);\n  var randReprojected = random.reproject({crs: image.projection(), scale: 30});\n\n  // Return the randomly masked image\n  return image.updateMask(randReprojected);\n}\n\n// Map the function over the image collection and add a random mask per-image\nvar colRandMasked = collection.map(randomMask);\n\n// Show the result of one image and center the zoom on that image\nMap.addLayer(colRandMasked.first(), {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 0.3}, 'Masked per-image');\nMap.centerObject(colRandMasked.first().geometry())\n\n```\n\n**Option 2:** Make a composite and randomly mask pixels correctly for a specified region of interest on earth\n\nNote that this solutions makes an image composite for the whole world, as in you example script. However, the mask aligns correctly in the region of interest, but will mismatch pixels more the further you will go away from this ROI.\n\n```js\n// set a location of interest\nvar ROI = ee.Geometry.Point([-90.43283, 20.76684]);\n// Get the projection of the location of interest from a random Landsat image at that location\nvar proj = collection.filterBounds(ROI).first().projection();\n\n// make a median composite image from the cloudmask images\nvar composite = collection.median();\n\n// randomly mask the composite on the projection of the location of interest\nvar random = ee.Image.random().select('random').gt(0.2);\nvar randReprojected = random.reproject({crs: proj, scale: 30});\n\n// Return the randomly masked image\nvar randMaskedComp = composite.updateMask(randReprojected);\n\n// Show the result of the random masked composite and center on ROI\nMap.addLayer(randMaskedComp, {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 0.3}, 'Composite masked');\nMap.centerObject(ROI, 13);\n\n```\n\nI hope I have made clear the drawbacks and impossibilities of your desired operation, but still provide a workable solution for you.  \n\nHere is the link to the working full code: [Script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/febcb914a8d2e894d96e862fae20e9a3)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to randomly mask pixels in a Landsat image composite using Google Earth Engine, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) Random masking can be easily applied to a global composite image without any projection issues.\n\nB) Creating a composite image first and then applying a random mask will always result in perfectly aligned masked pixels across the entire image.\n\nC) Random masking is best applied on a per-image basis before creating a composite to avoid projection mismatches.\n\nD) Reprojecting a random mask to match the composite image's projection will solve all alignment issues globally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Random masking is best applied on a per-image basis before creating a composite to avoid projection mismatches. This is because:\n\n1. Landsat images have different projections around the globe due to being projected on a rectangular grid.\n2. Creating a composite image blends pixels from multiple images, which can lead to misalignment when applying a mask afterwards.\n3. Applying the mask to individual images before compositing ensures that the mask aligns correctly with each image's unique projection.\n4. This method avoids the issues that arise when trying to apply a single random mask to a global composite, where projection differences can cause significant misalignments away from the region of interest.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the projection differences across a global image. Option D is also incorrect because while reprojecting can help in a specific region of interest, it doesn't solve alignment issues globally due to the varying projections of Landsat images across the Earth's surface."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/12", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/49541", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/6323/"], "docs_id": 49541, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend asked me to translate her thesis synopsis into english.

Whilst the Arduino can accept up to 11V input it is not able to power \"high\" voltage external components. What would be the recommended route for this scenario?

You connect the circuit consisting of the solenoid, voltage limiting resistor, flyback diode and MOSFET in parallel with the arduino. You'd connect the \\+9 V to both the arduino DC positive and the solenoid, and you'd connect the ground to both the arduino DC negative and the MOSFET drain pin.\n2. A solenoid which dissipates 1\\.6 W at 6 V will indeed draw 1\\.6/6 \\= 267 mA. However, using a 23 ohm resistor for dropping the 9 V supply voltage to 6 V won't work; 23\\*0\\.267 \\= \\~6 V. You calculated the resistance of the solenoid, not the extra resistance needed for 9 V operation (which is 11\\.25 ohms, 0\\.8 W).\n3. That should be all you need, but I'd add a capacitor (0\\.1 \\- 10 uF) between the 9 V supply and ground for good measure, to prevent voltage transients from coupling to the microcontroller on the arduino board.

I'd get another pieces of blocking maybe even a piece of 3/4 ply and screw it into both the 2x6 bottom plate of the wall and screw down from your new subfloor into this piece. The initial piece will hold most of the weight and the blocking on flat will keep the back end from deflecting but doesn't have to go the full width of the joist bay. If you use ply then you'd want to make a couple ledgers for side support on the two joists.\n\nFor the joist bay with the vent and the drain pipe; I'd get a length of angle iron.

There is really only one last question that I can't resist asking, just to make sure I haven't misunderstood something.\n\nHow do the photons come into thermal equilibrium with the walls of the blackbody cavity if the walls are made of perfect conductors (an assumption being made in many articles on the subject)?\n\nThe reason we assume that the walls are made of conductors is to make sure that the electric and magnetic fields vanish at the boundary, which implies that the wavelengths need to perfectly fit within the walls of the container, such that the fields are zero there. But if the walls are made of perfect conductors, then won't the photons just reflect off of the surface (since conductors are good reflectors) without ever interchanging thermal energy with the walls? In that case, they would never come into equilibrium, and all of the calculations involving Boltzmann's distribution that is used in the derivation wouldn't work, since Boltzmann's distribution applies to small systems that are in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, and in this case I guess the photons are the small systems and the walls are meant to be the reservoirs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The walls of the cavity are not made of conductor, since in this case they would be reflecting, instead of absorbing all the radiation.\n\nIn statistical physics one usually neglects the interactions leading to the establishment of the equilibrium. For example, the Maxwell\\-Boltzmann distribution does not depend on the collisions between the atoms, which are responsible for establishment of the equilibrium. Using developer's language, *this is not a bug, but a feature* \\- the statistical mechanics is based on logical reasoning, which allows to obtain very general results without sinking in gory details.\n\nIf course, in reality there are processes that lead to the establishment of the thermal equilibrium. E.g., if we start with a gas of two\\-level atoms, with transition frequency $\\\\omega$, and no radiation \\- we would expect, in the first approximation, that only the radiation modes of this frequency will come into equilibrium with atoms. For full equilibrium we need to account for higher order processes, such as, e.g., the Raman scattering. Thus, this may take longer for the Planck's distribution to establish, but it will eventually be achieved \\- we believe in this, as we believe in energy conservation.\n\n**Remark**  \n\nAs one can see from the answers here (and from a discussion around [a concurrent question](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/645671/247642)), some confusion results from different ways one can define the black body radiation (BBR):\n\n* *BBR is a photon gas in thermal equilibrium* If the number of photons in mode $\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda$ is described by canonical distribution,\n$$\np(n\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda})\\\\propto e^{\\-\\\\beta \\\\hbar\\\\omega\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda}n\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda}},\n$$\nPlanck's formula readily follows. In this case the radiation does not necessarily have to be in a contact with a black body \\- the role of the body/material is to mediate the energy exchange between the photon modes, for the thermal equilibrium to establish. This is the point of view adopted above. A *perfect metal* reflects all the radiation, and cannot lead to thermodynamic equilibrium. On the other hand, a metal with finite conductivity can do so (although not very efficiently) \\- the filament of an incadescent lamp could be discussed in this context. Black body is defined here as a body that emits radiation that is already black.\n* *BBR is the radiation emitted by a black body* Here one postulates the properties of a black body \\- an object in thermal equilibrium that absorbs all the radiation incident at it. One can then calculate the radiation emitted by this object, which will be described by Planck's formula. This approach was taken historically, and presented in most introductory QM books, which is why many people stick to it. It's advantage is that one does not really need a cavity \\- the radiation is already black, which is how one applies Planck's formula to the radiation emitted by stars and other thermal sources, which are clearly non\\-equilibrium situations. (The cavity does appear in this approach, as a way to model a black body.)

Notice that to apply it you *need* to know either [conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability), or joint probabilities. This is a basic application of Bayes theorem and it has many nice applications (see e.g. [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/185817/interpretation-of-bayes-theorem-applied-to-positive-mammography-results)).\n\nNow important thing to notice: [applying Bayes theorem is **not the same** as using Bayesian statistics](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/243109/how-to-do-bayesian-updating-for-a-simple-practical-problem/243138#243138). $P(S)$ in your example is not more *prior*, then $P(R)$. Moreover, to calculate the \"posterior\" probability you need to know the joint or conditional probabilities. If you are thinking of some simple example like *\"there is 0\\.7 probability that Jack has stolen an orange from the shop\"*, you cannot apply Bayes theorem to such problem by assuming that in your opinion the probability is, for example, 0\\.3, unless you also know the joint probabilities (probability that he is guilty when you assume he is etc.), or conditional probabilities (probability that you assume that he is guilty given the fact that he is guilty). This is *not* the way how we use *priors* in statistics.\n\nWhen applying Bayes theorem in statistics we have some data $X$ that can be described using probability density function $f\\_\\\\theta$, but we do not know the value of it's parameter $\\\\theta$. To estimate $\\\\theta$ we can use many different statistical approaches, for example, [maximum likelihood estimation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/112451/maximum-likelihood-estimation-mle-in-layman-terms) by maximizing the likelihood function\n\n$$ \\\\DeclareMathOperator\\*{\\\\argmax}{arg\\\\,max} \\\\argmax\\_{\\\\theta} f\\_\\\\theta( X ) $$ \n\nOther approach to the problem is to include some *prior* information into the process of estimating the parameter and use a Bayesian approach. This is done by using Bayes theorem, but in a different way. First, we assume some probability distribution for $\\\\theta$, let's call it $g$, and then assume *a priori* that the unknown parameter follows this distribution. We use Bayes theorem to combine the two sources of information: our *a priori* assumptions about $\\\\theta$, that is our *prior* $g$; and the information that is contained in the data, that is [*likelihood*](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224037/wikipedia-entry-on-likelihood-seems-ambiguous/224299#224299) function $f\\_\\\\theta(X)$, so to obtain *posterior* estimate $g(\\\\theta \\| X)$: \n\n$$ g(\\\\theta \\| X) \\\\propto f\\_\\\\theta(X) \\\\, g(\\\\theta) $$\n\nIf this still sounds complicated, you can start by going through multiple other questions tagged [bayesian](/questions/tagged/bayesian \"show questions tagged 'bayesian'\") for lots of examples. There is also many good introductory books to start with, e.g. [*Bayesian Data Analysis*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Andrew Gelman *et al*, or [*Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, Second Edition:\nA Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan*](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/what-s-new-in-2nd-ed) by John K.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Revised answer:\n\nI think Landau is referring to the [extrinsic Euler angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) parametrization of rotations (also known as the method of [Givens rotations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation) or Jacobi rotations). Basically, there is an explicit algorithm by which one can achieve any orientation\\-preserving orthogonal transformation as a (highly non\\-unique) sequence of rotations in pairs of coordinates. You can prove the existence of this decomposition in general by induction on the number of coordinates, and this is essentially what Philip Gibbs did in [his answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/12331/rotations-in-space-time/12366#12366), for the case of dimension 4\\.\n\n---\n\nOriginal answer:\n\nThe only way I know how to make Landau's statement both precise and correct is to say that the vector space of first\\-order infinitesimal rotations in 4 dimensions is spanned by infinitesimal rotations in the 6 pairs of axes. (In particular, the word \"resolved\" here is a bit of a puzzle to me.)\n\nAny linear transformation in $n$ dimensions (including any rotation) can be written as an $n \\\\times n$ matrix, where for each $k$ between $1$ and $n$, the $k$th column of the matrix gives the coordinates of where the $k$th basis vector goes. In order for a transformation to be a rotation, we need the lengths of the vectors to be preserved, and we need the angles between them to stay the same. We can encode these conditions in a succinct equation asserting that our matrix times its transpose is the identity. The set of such transformations is given by the solutions to the matrix equation, so it forms an algebraic subset of the $n^2$\\-dimensional space of matrices. In fact, it has the structure of a Lie group, called the orthogonal group $O(n)$.\n\nWe can describe infinitesimal rotations by adding an infinitesimal element $\\\\epsilon$ to our number system, which satisfies the properties that $\\\\epsilon \\\\neq 0$ and $\\\\epsilon^2 \\= 0$. An infinitesimal transformation is a matrix of the form $I \\+ \\\\epsilon M$, where $I$ is the $n \\\\times n$ identity matrix, and $M$ is any matrix with real (non\\-infinitesimal) entries. In order for this to be a rotation, it is necessary and sufficient that the matrix equation $(I \\+ \\\\epsilon M)(I \\+ \\\\epsilon M)^T \\= I$ is satisfied.

It's as if the program can't see the regular (and regular italic) styles, except that Word itself lists all four styles in the font menu and displays the name of the font using the regular variant. It's just in the text that it's misbehaving.\n\nNo other app seems to have this problem, and Font Book reports no problems with the font. This behavior appeared only recently, as it was noticed first today in a file that uses the font and was last edited without problem on Aug 3\\.\n\nThe same problem appears with Adobe Caslon Pro.\n\nI've tried clearing the system font caches and Word's font cache. I've tried disabling and re\\-enabling the font. I've restored a previous version of Word from Time Machine. None of these has had any effect. Other similar fonts work fine, for example, Garamond Premier Pro.\n\nI have several files very carefully formatted using Adobe Garamond Pro, so I'm not eager to change the font to something that's working properly, then have to redo the formatting.

It also, from the second time on, has a number of font names appearing in all upper case.\n\nIf I had to guess, the first time it's run Word reads in all the font data from the system correctly. When quit (or sometime before that) it writes that data to disk, but when it reads that data in subsequently, something goes wrong.

The apm_power_off() function makes a BIOS call with the APM_STATE_OFF code to initiate a power-off sequence.\n\nnative_machine_halt() stops the CPU but doesn't necessarily cut power. machine_shutdown() is an infinite loop used in the shutdown process but doesn't directly cut power. stop_this_cpu() disables IRQs and sets the CPU offline but doesn't power off the system.\n\nThe native_machine_power_off() function is the most comprehensive in attempting to cut power, first trying pm_power_off(), then falling back to other methods if that's not available. This makes it the most suitable answer for a function that cuts off power to the system."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/01", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/41978", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/15208/"], "docs_id": 41978, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was just curious if SQL Devs write their code freehand or do they make use of the visual query designer to generate queries?

The documentation suggests that experienced SQL developers often prefer to write queries \"freehand\" (i.e., typing SQL directly) for most tasks. This approach is favored because it often provides more control and can be faster for those proficient in SQL.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation indicates that visual query designers are not the primary tool for experienced developers, as they can sometimes increase complexity.\n\nOption B is too extreme. While freehand coding is common, it's unlikely that developers never use visual tools, especially for very complex queries or when exploring new database structures.\n\nOption C aligns best with the information provided. It reflects the preference for freehand coding while acknowledging that visual tools might occasionally be useful for complex scenarios.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it suggests an equal reliance on both methods for every query, which is not supported by the given information.\n\nThe question tests the understanding of real-world SQL development practices and the balance between manual coding and using visual tools."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/06", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134697", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/172880/"], "docs_id": 134697, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems to me that SO questions go in some sort of a cycle, with waves of newbie questions occurring for a week or two, then somewhat less naive questions for a few weeks.

This results in a power dissipation equivalent to one diode continuously conducting. With a 2V drop across a diode at 112A, the power dissipation is 2V * 112A = 224W per block. The key factor is the alternating conduction pattern within each block, which leads to this continuous equivalent dissipation."}}
