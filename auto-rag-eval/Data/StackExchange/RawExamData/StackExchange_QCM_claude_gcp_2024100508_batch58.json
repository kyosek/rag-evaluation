If you're actually transmitting a signal it has more to do with how it interacts with the physical world. Specifically, if I'm broadcasting a signal at some frequency, a radio receiver that's set up to have a very narrow bandwidth will receive my signal over a *range* of frequencies, even if that receiver is implemented with vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors, resistors, and some quartz crystals. That range of frequencies will be the representative of my transmitted signal's bandwidth.\n\n\\* Or the signal's energy, if it's a one\\-time event. Usually \"bandwidth\" is for a signal that goes on and on, like a phone conversation or a datastream sent over radio."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a communication system and needs to understand the concept of signal bandwidth.

Signal bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies over which the majority of the signal's power (for continuous signals) or energy (for one-time events) is contained. This concept is crucial in both signal analysis and practical transmission applications.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bandwidth is not a single frequency, but a range of frequencies.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it confuses bandwidth with amplitude, which are different signal characteristics.\n\nOption D is incorrect because bandwidth is a frequency-domain concept, not a time-domain measurement.\n\nUnderstanding bandwidth is essential for designing effective communication systems, as it impacts how signals interact with physical transmission media and receiving equipment.

The VPN connects successfully when using the openvpn command directly, but fails when attempting to connect through NetworkManager.

The solution is to update the openvpn package to the latest version compatible with NetworkManager.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue is likely caused by NetworkManager's requirement to \"own the default route\" before allowing VPN connections. Even though the network interfaces appear to be properly managed, NetworkManager may still be unable to find a suitable default route. Adding any default route, even one to 127.0.0.1, can satisfy this requirement and allow the VPN connection to proceed. This explains why the connection works when initiated through nm-applet but fails when using the command line, as the GUI might be handling this requirement differently."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/26", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/301044", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/140278/"], "docs_id": 301044, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LzpTM.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LzpTM.png)\n\nSo I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CmbItRjM-Y&t=110s) Khan Academy video. For explaining the patterns formed on the screen they assumed $8$ point sources and said that **if** the point source number $1$ interferes destructively with point source number $5$ **then** the rest of the waves also mutually cancel out (destructive interference). I agree with the video upto this part. But my question is : **Why should we consider 8 point sources and not an odd number of point sources like (say) 9 ?** If we consider $9$ point sources the explanation is no longer valid. Suppose at the shown point of the screen wave from point source $1$ interferes destructively with wave from point source $6$ then waves from point sources $2,3,4,7,8,9$ also cancel out pairwise as before. But the wave from point $5$ still remains and does not mutually cancel out with another other light wave (from another point source). So if we consider odd number of point sources the shown point on the screen should not have a dark fringe (or minima).\n\n**To sum up my queries:**\n\n* Why should we take even number of point sources to explain single slit diffraction pattern ?\n* Is there any method to resolve this discrepancy ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is, taking an even or odd number of point sources is an approximation and therefore seems to lead to discrepancies in any case; as the guy says in the video, one should take into consideration an infinite number of point sources, but drawing them would be too long so he chooses to take eight. \n\nThe reasoning comes from Huygens' principle ([what is it?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle \"Huygens-Frenel principle\")): so to be completely correct, one should make all the calculations with an integral (thus including every one of the infinite, infinitesimally small point sources) and would indeed arrive to the same result for the interference pattern, obtained with rigorous means.\n\nSo to answer your question, the need to have an even number of point sources is a consequence of the approximate nature of the reasoning used in the video, and is not an intrinsic inconsistency of the theory (when you have an infinite number of point sources, it doesn't even make sense to wonder if they are even or odd)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In explaining single slit diffraction patterns, why is it common to use an even number of point sources (like 8) rather than an odd number?\n\nA) Even numbers are mathematically simpler to work with in wave calculations.\nB) Odd numbers of sources always result in incomplete cancellation, which is physically impossible.\nC) It's an approximation method that allows for easier visualization of pairwise wave cancellation.\nD) The number of sources must match the width of the slit, which is always an even number of wavelengths.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Using an even number of point sources is an approximation technique that simplifies the explanation of interference patterns in single slit diffraction. It allows for easier visualization of pairwise wave cancellation. However, this is not physically accurate, as real slits have infinitely many point sources. The correct approach would involve integrating over all points in the slit opening, as described by the Huygens-Fresnel principle. The even/odd distinction becomes irrelevant when considering the actual continuous nature of the wavefront.

Those panels usually have provisions for lugs at the top and bottom of the busing that could feed a transfer switch. \n\nThe conductors feeding both panels on the load side of the switch would need to be sized at 200A unless the length of wire satisfied one of the tap rules. An alternative might be to change the panel closest to the switch to a 200A, feed it with 200A wire and take a 100A load off it to feed the remaining 100A panel."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is upgrading a home's electrical system to allow a backup generator to power the entire house.

See [this question](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/65425/4280), which has two valid answers, one of which mine.\n\nThe fact that you have shown the rectangles are a base, plus the fact there is *some* countable base, shows that we can thin out the rectangles to a countable base, and so we can use that countable subfamily to form the unions.\n\nThere is also another way, which might be easier (but the thinning out is a useful fact in general): suppose $O \\= \\\\cup\\_{i \\\\in I} U\\_i$ where the $U\\_i, i \\\\in I$ are open and $I$ is any index set, and suppose we also have some countable base $B\\_n, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$. Then for every $x \\\\in O$, pick $i(x) \\\\in I$ such that $x \\\\in U\\_{i(x)}$, and then pick $n(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\\\subseteq U\\_{i(x)}$, as we have a base. \n\nHaving done that, consider $N' \\= \\\\{n(x) : x \\\\in O \\\\}$ which is countable as a subset of $\\\\mathbb{N}$. For every $n \\\\in N'$, $n \\= n(x)$ for some $x \\\\in O$, pick one, and define $I'$ to be the set of all $i(x)$ of the $x$ chosen this way.\n\nThen $I'$ is at most countable, as we pick one element for each $n \\\\in N'$. And $O \\= \\\\cup\\_{i \\\\in I'} U\\_i$. Why? right to left inclusion is obvious, as we omit sets, and if $x \\\\in O$, we have $i(x), n(x)$ as before such that $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\\\subseteq U\\_{i(x)}$ and this shows that $n \\= n(x)$ (for this $x$) is of course in $N'$. So we picked some $x' \\\\in O$ such that $n \\= n(x')$, and so also $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\= B\\_{n(x')} \\\\subseteq U\\_i(x')$, and $i(x') \\\\in I'$ by construction. This proves the other inclusion. \n\nWe have shown that in a second countable space every family of open sets has a countable subfamily with the same union. This property is known as being \"hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f\". \n\nNote that both of these proofs heavily use choice. So we could also use an ad hoc proof that immediately specialises to rectangles with rational endpoints, using the fact the rationals are dense in the reals.

Datacenter design *can* be a speciality, and at a scale above a couple thousand square feet probably *is* a speciality, but does have a set of topics that a system administrator can be reasonably expected to know.\n\nThe Larger Story\n================\n\nA system administrator is a generalist knowledge domain. Some sysadmins tend to focus on one thing versus another thing, and no sysadmin really looks like another. However it is self evident that a sysadmin will be working on switches, routers, databases, server OSs, firmware, hardware replacement, wiring, VOIP, firewalls, storage, HPC clusters, threat mitigation, PCI compliance, wireless signals, mobile phones, etc. and etc.\n\nEach of the above topic domains *can* be specialized in to such a degree that a person that does so might not be considered a sysadmin. Someone who is a VOIP engineer is... just that. A VOIP engineer. Not a sysadmin. Someone that is a storage administrator can have a depth of knowledge and a tightly scoped domain of responsibility that makes them... just that. A storage administrator. Not a sysadmin.\n\nI like to use database administrators as an example. A sysadmin, in the course of performing his duties, will have a high probability of working with databases. Maybe it's as simple as spinning up a MySQL database for a Cacti instance. Maybe it's as complex as working with replication, sharding, split tables, indexing, and query execution plans for a large application. However, there are also database administrators (DBAs) as a separate professional arena. DBAs are specialists in their field (or at least *should* be) and due to their constant exposure to databases and the theories and practices behind information storage and retrieval in a relational database, will have a honed domain of knowledge and speciality that is beyond a sysadmin's (typically... or perhaps *ideally* if not typically). They are no longer sysadmins, but DBAs.\n\nNow some sysadmins might have never, ever touched a database server. Never ran an SQL query. Never worked with anything more complex than a spreadsheet. Does that make them less of a sysadmin? No. However, *just because they have never used a RDBMS does not mean that someone who has done so is a specialist and that the general skillset of database administration is outside the realm of a sysadmin.*\n\nIn a similar manner, datacenter design and management has the *potential* to be within the scope of a sysadmin. Topics like rack design, rack placement, hot and cold aisles, concrete floors, raised floors, cable plant management, ceiling types, AC sizing, AC duct placement, circuit sizing, electric voltage selection, fire retardants, physical security, generators, etc. and etc. *can* be part of a sysadmin's duties. It could be for a 100 square foot closet. It could be for a 1,000 square foot room or perhaps larger. If it gets much larger than 1,000 square feet, then it seems that a specialist company and set of engineers should be consulted to do the main design phase, with input from sysadmins (thus, sysadmins would still be at least a *part* of the design process, thus datacenter design and management would still be within scope of a sysadmin).\n\nOnce you get past a certain arbitrary level of knowledge, job description, and daily duties, then somewhere along the line you become a DC manager or DC designer, in much the same way that at some point along the line you would become a DBA and not a SysAdmin, or a storage admin, or a security specialist, or a VOIP engineer, etc.\n\nI've made a mockup Venn diagram that shows my thoughts (yes, this is my opinion and not based on any empirical research; this is purely my experience in the field):\n\n![Venn digram of sysadmin skills](https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeREz.png)\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nAspects of datacenter design are on topic for ServerFault and sysadmins in general. We should not consider a speciality community just yet. Yes, I know we quibble about the fracturing of StackExchange into Security, DBAs, U\\&L, etc. However, that's another topic. For now, while we don't have a specialist community for Datacenter designers and managers, it's still on topic here just like database administration and UNIX/Linux questions are, within a certain scope, on topic as well.\n\nAddendum 1\n==========\n\nIain brings up a good point: *\"Datacenter design is an architecture task\"*\n\nI can both agree and disagree with that. Selecting load bearing beams, rebar sizes and placement, lashings for ducts, what mix of concrete to pour, and etc. would be for the architectural engineers. Placement of racks, choice of voltages, runs of cable, sizing cooling systems, types of battery switchovers *could* be something a sysadmin does, but could also be part of an architectural engineer / datacenter designer's job. A sysadmin doesn't have to be bonded, licensed, or otherwise take a state\\-official engineering exam to make most of those decisions (depending on locality of course). So while it's not necessarily a part of a sysadmin's job, it *could* be within the scope and by experience is within the scope.\n\nI think part of the controversy is the *scale* of what we think of as a \"datacenter.\" It can mean anything from a few hundred square foot place for a handful of racks, to a million square foot, billion dollar city\\-state of a complex. A sysadmin is unlikely to have much to say about the larger datacenters, or speciality structures for high density, HPC uses. However for the approximately 1,000 to 2,000 square foot server rooms / small datacenters, sysadmins are, in my experience, normally the ones who have a large part in the actual design of those rooms, even to the point of CADing out placement of racks and thinking about air flow, etc.\n\nConverting a few hundred to few thousand foot segment of office space, warehouse, basement, or what\\-have\\-you into a \"datacenter\" complete with raised floor, tons of cooling, backup power, generators, fuel contracts, wiring, voltage selection, etc. has, once again only in my experience, been largely up to the sysadmins of an organization and is not technically or (sometimes) legally an architectural/engineering issue other than \"call the structural engineer to see if the floor can hold us!\"\n\nAddendum 2\n==========\n\nI made another Venn diagram! This is rough, not to scale, and hastily tossed together while past midnight, but I hope this at least conveys the thought:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6I1s.png)\n\nSo there are definitely portions of work in DC design that shouldn't be touched by sysadmins, most notably the ones where law is involved, and structural engineering is needed. But datacenter design is only partly about those things. Yes, stay away from decisions regarding laws about doors, precise placement of anti\\-fire systems, locks, etc.\n\nBut the pink stuff, and the blue stuff in the diagram above are things that can, by and large, be touched by a sysadmin or the final decisions can be made by sysadmins (thus making sysadmins in\\-part designers). Not the physical installation of a CRAC or the circuit panels, but the decision on how much cooling, how much power, and even specific vendors to go with. Not necessarily cable pulling (although, how many sysadmins have pulled cable in their life? Can I see a count of hands? Uh\\-huh. A lot of us wire fishers, huh) but choosing cable types, amounts, and even plant paths to account for growth in IDFs outwards from the MDF. Certainly I'm not thinking about monster DCs, but rather a few hundred to thousand square feet of server room / datacenter space. Apple\\-sized DCs \\-\\- no way."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion, which of the following best describes the relationship between system administration and datacenter design skills?\n\nA) System administration and datacenter design are completely separate fields with no overlap in skills or responsibilities.\n\nB) All aspects of datacenter design fall within the scope of system administration, regardless of the size or complexity of the datacenter.\n\nC) System administration has a subset of skills that overlap with datacenter design, particularly for smaller datacenters, but larger or more complex datacenters require specialists.\n\nD) System administrators should never be involved in any aspect of datacenter design, as it is exclusively the domain of architectural engineers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation argues that system administration has, as a subset of its larger potential skills, an overlapping portion of datacenter design's skillset.

However, for larger datacenters or more complex designs, specialists are typically needed.

Which of the following approaches would be most effective for accomplishing this task?\n\nA) Use the \"Export tile cache (Data management)\" tool to convert the tiles to a .tpk file, then import that into QGIS.\n\nB) Use the \"Export data\" option in ArcGIS to directly export the cached tiles as a georeferenced image.\n\nC) Create a fishnet grid over the area of interest, use data driven pages to export image tiles, then mosaic the tiles together.\n\nD) Directly access the _alllayers folder and use the conf.cdi and config.xml files to reconstruct the image from the cached tiles.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option A would not work because the .tpk format is not directly usable in QGIS. Option B is mentioned in the question as producing only a black image. Option D, while theoretically possible, would require complex custom coding to interpret the configuration files and reconstruct the image.\n\nOption C, using a fishnet grid and data driven pages to export image tiles, is the most practical and effective approach described in the documentation. This method allows for exporting high-resolution sections of the map, which can then be mosaicked together to create a complete, georeferenced image usable in QGIS or other GIS software."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/03", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/640173", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/98583/"], "docs_id": 640173, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I don't have a way to connect my desktop directly to the router, so I'm connecting to my laptop and using a bridged connection on the laptop to give my desktop internet access.

When a laptop enters sleep mode, its operating system cannot maintain active network interfaces. This means it can't route packets between its network interfaces, which is essential for the bridged connection to function.

The regularization term acts as a Bayesian prior on the components of the feature vectors, helping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization to the unknown ratings.

However, there will finally be a good, and precise question: *Should I use an impedance matching network when connecting cables of different impedance such as 50\u00a0\u03a9 and 75\u00a0\u03a9?* Possible answers will likely start with \"It depends...\", and this is why I provide a ton of background info first.\n\n**Intro**\n\nI wanted to get rid of an Ethernet cable thrown down along the stairs of my house. An existing, spare coax cable I had originally installed for satellite TV appeared to be promising as an alternative, cleanly hidden in the walls. Just when I was about to purchase proper little boxes for ethernet\\-over\\-antenna\\-style\\-coax (75\u00a0\u03a9, capable of something like 270\u00a0Mbit/s), I [remembered](https://superuser.com/questions/741978/10base2-a-k-a-thinnet-over-tv-coax-wrong-impedance-will-it-work) 10base2 \\- the good old BNC/RG58 coaxial ethernet system, and decided that its 10\u00a0Mbit/s were more than enough for my needs. The second hand market for hubs with a BNC connector or even fancy \"Ethernet Converters\" (coax to twisted pair) is still very good. The only thing I was unsure about was the impedance issue. 10base2 uses a 50\u00a0\u03a9 installation with RG58 cable, and pretty much any coax for home antenna systems (like my spare cable for satellite TV) has an impedance of 75\u00a0\u03a9.\n\nI am now happy to report that 10base2 is robust enough to handle the abuse of being run through 10\\...20\u00a0m of inappropriate 75\u00a0\u03a9 coax. [There, I fixed it!](https://www.google.com/search?q=there%20i%20fixed%20it&tbm=isch) Yay!\n\n**However, ...**\n\nI was still curious if the hack I had done was really bad (as in: just barely good enough) or maybe even quite acceptable. I looked at the signal with an oscilloscope. The setup is like this:\n![Setup](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xabY5.jpg)\n\nWithout any matching between the 50\u00a0\u03a9 and 75\u00a0\u03a9 segments of the coax, the result shows a very obvious amount of reflected noise. Despite this drawback, the \"eye\" is still wide open, and the decoders can happily do their job, resulting in a packet loss of exactly zero.\n![No matching network at either end.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XnI9c.jpg)\nWe're looking at a combination of the signals transmitted and received by the ethernet hub near the oscilloscope. Judging by the \"clean\" part, the transmitted signal has approx. 1\\.9\u00a0Vpkpk, and the received signal has 1\\.6\u00a0Vpkpk. If it's safe to assume that both drivers have an output of the same amplitude, we can even calculate the loss introduced by the cable: 20\u00d7log(1\\.6/1\\.9\\)dB\u00a0\\=\u00a01\\.5\u00a0dB. Good enough, because the calculation for 15\u00a0m of typical coax with 6\\.6\u00a0dB/100\u00a0m yields 1\u00a0dB.\n\nThe noise is greatly reduced when a matching network is inserted at the near or far ends of the 75\u00a0\u03a9 part of the coax. It looks like this (Credits to [this source](http://ham-radio.com/k6sti/match.htm))...\n![Matching_Network](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lpQa.jpg)\n\nWith the matching network at the near end...\n![Matching network at near end of 75\u00a0\u03a9 coax](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sEITd.jpg)\n... there are still some reflections visible travelling back from the unmatched far end.\n\nWith the matching network at the far end, there must also be reflections along the comparatively short 50\u00a0\u03a9 cable between the hub and the discontinuity labeled \"near\", but as I've learned from a friend, the scope can't \"see\" them, because they are absorbed by the driver. Also, a part of the signal from the \"far\" driver is reflected and travels back along the 75\u00a0\u03a9 cable, and gets terminated into the matching network on the far end:\n![Matching network at far end of 75\u00a0\u03a9 coax](https://i.stack.imgur.com/29esC.jpg)\n\nCompared to the unmatched setup, the amplitude of the signal from the far end is approximately halved (\\-6\u00a0dB), and this is in good agreement with the theory that predicts a loss of 5\\.6\u00a0dB over the network and the impedance it \"looks\" into.\n\nAll of the above work, i.e. no matching network or one matching network at either the near or the far end. \"Work\" means I can `ping -f` over the segment for hours without one lost packet.\n\nNow, why not use two matching networks at \"near\" *and* \"far\"? Well, 10base2 is designed for a maximum length of 185\u00a0m of RG58, having a loss of 6\\.6\u00a0dB/100\u00a0m or 12\\.2\u00a0dB/185\u00a0m. Therefore, two of my resistive matching networks would already eat almost all the signal and bring me so close to the allowed limit that, including the cable, there is too much loss altogether. I am still in doubt that a low\\-loss, transformer\\-based solution would work because I think 10base2 (\"cheapernet\") needs a DC path: \"DC LEVEL: The DC component of the signal has to be between 37 mA and 45 mA. The tolerance here is tight since collisions are detected by monitoring the average DC level on the coax.\" ([Source: p.4](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/national/_appNotes/AN-0442.pdf); also backed up by [this data sheet](http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/ds/symlink/dp8392.pdf)) Then again; the resistive matching network will also put any DC bias in trouble...\n\n**After all,** \n\n... the short question again: *Should I use an impedance matching network when connecting cables of different impedance such as 50\u00a0\u03a9 and 75\u00a0\u03a9?*\n\nAnything between \"I prefer the unmatched/matched setup because I like this/that oscillogram better\" to answers with plenty of background info on RF or the low\\-level hardware of 10base2 is greatly appreciated.\n\n**Edit**\n\nIf you have access to the inside of the Coaxial Transceiver Interface (CTI), you can modify the circuit between the chip (*8392* seems to be the type made by a large variety of manufacturers and also the type that's used almost exclusively for pretty much any interface made by anyone for 10base2 adapters) and the BNC connector. A trade\\-off for cables with 75\u00a0\u03a9 and 93\u00a0\u03a9 is possible at the cost of allowed bus length. National Semiconductor made an Application Note on this topic, called [AN\\-620](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/national/_appNotes/AN-0620.pdf) (pdf, Sept. 1992\\).\n\nBut even after finding this app'note, it would be great to find some background info about what's inside an 8392, i.e. what one would have to use to build the interface using discrete parts and maybe some glue logic and opamps.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Experience1 has shown that the resistive matching network is a good option for 10 base 2 Ethernet only at a first glance. It helps improve the situation when it comes to RF signal quality, but I have overlooked the issues caused by the way 10 base 2 handles collision detection, which are low\\-frequency effects and can be understood by simple DC considerations.\n\n**The connection will work best without any resisitive impedance matching network between the 50 \u03a9 terminations and the 75 \u03a9 cable segment.**\n\nSignal reflections and overshoots caused by the mismatch won't bother the transceivers much, but collision detection looks at the average (filtered) current into the cable, and with the resistive matching network, the current level is sometimes out of the specified limits. It all boils down to a consideration of DC currents created by the transmitters' voltages being dropped across the 50 \u03a9 terminations of the cable (I\\=U/R). Adding thee resistive network will create a parallel path to the terminations and increase the DC current. This may sometimes mess with the collision detection. In my experience, this will mainly happen on hot summer days with high humidity levels, probably because of increased DC leakage along the dielectric in the coax.\n\nTL, DR: **10 base 2 will easily handle the abuse of being sent over 75 \u03a9 antenna coax. Overshoots, reflections, and any other side effects of the signal's RF part are not a concern. However, the collision detection looks at low\\-frequency currents, and it needs exactly two 50 \u03a9 termination resistors at each end of the coax. Adding resistors will change the DC resistance of (50\u00a0\u03a9)/2\u00a0\\=\u00a025\u00a0\u03a9 and cause the collision detection circuits to work unreliably.**\n\nHaving read around the internetsTM and having talked to some pretty experienced, old\\-school LAN experts has shown that this is a very common misconception. Therefore, please excuse the bold typeface font above. The misconception is even on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5), as [this related question](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/131887/930) shows.\n\n---\n\nFootnote:\n\n1 Looking at the date of the original question, I have noticed that the system, with and without the resistive matching network, has now been in use for more than two years. I had trouble on some hot days in the summer of 2015\\. Then, I removed the resistive matching network and have had no issues at all ever since."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a 10BASE2 Ethernet network, what is the recommended approach when connecting a 50\u03a9 cable segment to a 75\u03a9 cable segment?\n\nA) Use a resistive impedance matching network at both ends of the 75\u03a9 segment\nB) Use a resistive impedance matching network at one end of the 75\u03a9 segment\nC) Use a transformer-based impedance matching network at both ends of the 75\u03a9 segment\nD) Connect the segments directly without any impedance matching network\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While it may seem counterintuitive from an RF perspective, the correct approach for 10BASE2 Ethernet is to connect the 50\u03a9 and 75\u03a9 segments directly without any impedance matching network. This is because:\n\n1. 10BASE2 is robust enough to handle the signal reflections and overshoots caused by the impedance mismatch.\n2.

Small air\\-cooled [Hobby motors](https://www.kdedirect.com/collections/featured/products/kde8218xf-120), supposedly have continuous power/weight ratios of \\>7 kW/kg while Siemens' aerospace\\-optimized [AC motor](https://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/2016/corporate/2016-12-innovation/inno2016-aerobatic-airplane-e.pdf) has a \"record\\-breaking\" 5 kW/kg ratio *with liquid cooling*.\n\nWhat gives?! \n\n**Question**: Does the power\\-to\\-weight ratio of electric motors not change with size, or does power/weight vs size just not change as quickly compared to combustion engines?\n\n---\n\n**EDITS/Understanding thus far**: According to Neil\\_UK, Brian Drummond, and Charles Cowie, a motor's ability to dissipate heat is proportional to surface area (\\\\$Q \\\\sim DL\\\\$) while its [peak power is proportional to volume](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/research/power/pebn/pebn009%20sizing%20of%20electrical%20machines.pdf) (\\\\$P\\_{max} \\= T\\_{max}\\\\omega \\\\sim(D^2L)\\\\omega\\\\$). Assuming weight is linearly proportional to volume (\\\\$W \\\\sim D^2L\\\\$), then the continuous power/weight ratio of electric motors actually *decreases* with size because \n\n\\\\$ P\\_{cont}/W \\\\sim DL/D^2L \\\\sim 1/D \\\\$\n\nCorrect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Small hobby propellor motors have a high power to weight ratio because small motor and small propellors can easily operate at high RPMs, in the 10,000 RPM order of magnitude. The cited paper is about motors in the area of 2000 to 3000 RPM.\n\nMotor weight and volume is somewhat proportional to torque and not so much related to power. A motor of a given size will provide the same torque over wide range of speeds. The higher the speed, the higher the power for the same size motor. The same thing is generally true for heat engines also.\n\nSee if the cited paper makes sense with that in mind.\n\n> I still don't understand the connection of these 2 arguments WRT the NASA paper.\n\nThe paper is lengthly and complex. It cites several references to other papers. This forum is intended to deal only with relatively narrow questions. I only scanned the paper briefly.\n\n> If heat engines also follow this trend, then why are people pursuing DEP all of a sudden?\n\nSerious large electric aircraft design is a new field. We should expect to see a lot of approaches explored. There is significant history in determining optimum number if engines for aircraft as illustrated below.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJ1Cq.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJ1Cq.jpg)\n\n> ... the continuous power/weight ratio of electric motors actually decreases with size...\n\nSince power \\= torque X rotational speed, a power/weight ratio is only meaningful if either torque or speed is constant for a given comparison.\n\nIn all aspects of this question, the balance of system (BOS) is an important factor. The BOS includes the control and monitoring system, fuel storage and delivery system, lubrication system, cooling system, structural support and enclosure system and perhaps others. Some parts of these may be integral to the motor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion, which statement best explains why distributed electric propulsion (DEP) is being pursued for aviation, despite the apparent power-to-weight ratio advantage of smaller motors?\n\nA) Small hobby motors always have higher power-to-weight ratios than larger aerospace motors due to inherent scaling laws.\n\nB) The power-to-weight ratio of electric motors increases linearly with size, making larger motors more efficient for aircraft.\n\nC) DEP allows for aerodynamic advantages that may outweigh the decreased power-to-weight ratio of larger motors.\n\nD) Electric motors of all sizes have identical power-to-weight ratios, so DEP offers no inherent advantages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While smaller motors can achieve higher power-to-weight ratios due to their ability to operate at higher RPMs, the NASA paper suggests that DEP is being pursued for its aerodynamic advantages in aircraft design. The discussion indicates that the continuous power-to-weight ratio of electric motors actually decreases with size due to heat dissipation limitations. However, the aerodynamic benefits of distributing multiple motors across an aircraft may outweigh this disadvantage, making DEP an attractive option for aviation companies. Additionally, the balance of system (BOS) factors, including control systems, cooling, and structural support, play a significant role in overall efficiency and are important considerations in aircraft design beyond just the motor's power-to-weight ratio."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/19", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/61312533", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/9015770/"], "docs_id": 61312533, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the following code:\n\n```\n<span class=\"dropDown\">Choose</span>\n<div class=\"dropdownQuestions active\" style=\"display: block; max-height: 310px;\">\n<span data-index=\"0\" data-value=\"1\" onclick=\"gt.setQuestion(this, true);\">Warrior</span>\n<span data-index=\"1\" data-value=\"2\" onclick=\"gt.setQuestion(this, true);\">Mage</span>\n<span data-index=\"2\" data-value=\"3\" onclick=\"gt.setQuestion(this, true);\">Sorcerer</span>\n\n```\n\nAnd what I want, if possible, is a list of the the drop down list so after I can use one of them to click, I have searched a lot and could not find any answer that would help me.\n\nOther option would be to click using the data\\-index, or data\\-value String.\nthe last option I would want is clicking by the String \"Warrior\", \"Mage\" or \"Sorcerer\", but if there is no other way, Ill be glad with that.\n\nthanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After clicking on the dropdown, you can get all the dropdown options in a list and later use them as you want(looping and selecting the desired option with specific condition or getting option by index).\n\n```\n  List<WebElement> options= driver.findElements(By.xpath(\"//span[@class='dropDown']/div/span\"));\n  options.get(1).click(); // here 1 is the index value of the option to select or you can use loop if looking for some specific condition\n\n```\n\nFor the image link you shared in the comment, try the following cssSelector:\n\n```\nList<WebElement> option= driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"div.questionDropdownOptions.activeSelectMenu span\"));\n                option.get(1).click();\n    }\n\n```\n\nNote: Please import below packages in your code:\n\n```\nimport java.util.List;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which Selenium WebDriver code snippet would correctly select the \"Mage\" option from the dropdown menu in the given HTML structure?\n\nA) driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//span[text()='Mage']\")).click();\n\nB) List<WebElement> options = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"div.dropdownQuestions.active span\"));\n   options.get(1).click();\n\nC) WebElement mage = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//span[@data-value='2']\"));\n   mage.click();\n\nD) List<WebElement> options = driver.findElements(By.xpath(\"//span[@class='dropDown']/following-sibling::div/span\"));\n   for(WebElement option : options) {\n       if(option.getText().equals(\"Mage\")) {\n           option.click();\n           break;\n       }\n   }\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) This approach directly clicks on the span element with text \"Mage\".

Is there any other way to expand inventory that is a little less time consuming?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Inventory slot expansion is based on two factors: cost and time efficiency.\n\nUpgrades can be acquired in two ways: for free, by repairing a Drop Pod expansion terminal or by buying them from a specialist on a Space Station OR the Anomaly.\n\nThe first strategy technically requires more time as you have to **find** the pod and **repair the terminal** be able to get the upgrade. Yet, both the two task can be made far more efficient:\n\n* Drop pods can be found by using a [Drop Pod Coordinate Data](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Drop_Pod_Coordinate_Data) and a Signal Booster. Data can be farmed relatively easily by buying them from vendors and as a reward from some missions, most notably the Nexus ones on the Space Anomaly.\n* The repair of the terminal **always uses the same materials** (currently as of the Expedition update should be 10 sodium nitrate, 1 carbon nanotube and 1 antimatter housing) so you CAN prepare those before getting to the pod.\n\nThe second strategy requires to do some system hopping since you can only buy a single expansion on the system Space Station (and the is assuming there is an active one in the first place \\- avoid Abandoned and Uncharted systems!) and another one in the Space Anomaly (yep, the Anomaly offers one upgrade per system \\- multitools on the Anomaly work in the same way).\n\nNow: what is more efficient?\nThe relevant thing to notice is that [bought upgrades prices scale FAST](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory#Upgrade_costs).\nCargo slot prices for example go from 50,000 units for the first slot to 1,000,000 for the last one (see the table on the wiki for additional info and numbers). Fully upgrading the inventory costs 45,555,000 units.  \n\nThis means that unless you already have access to good money making resources the more cost effective strategy is:\n\n* buy the first upgrades from space stations and the Anomaly\n* as soon as the prices scale over the average price for a Drop Pod Coordinate data (about 100,000 units) switch to those."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In No Man's Sky, a player wants to expand their inventory efficiently.

Initially, buying upgrades from Space Stations and the Anomaly is cheaper and faster. However, upgrade costs scale rapidly, with cargo slot prices increasing from 50,000 to 1,000,000 units. Once the upgrade price exceeds the average cost of Drop Pod Coordinate Data (about 100,000 units), it becomes more economical to switch to using Drop Pods. This strategy balances cost and time efficiency, especially for players who are just starting to accumulate wealth in the game. While Drop Pods are always free, finding and repairing them can be time-consuming without proper preparation, making them less efficient for the very first upgrades.

This method allows for precise control of LED brightness without needing to know the exact voltage-current characteristics of each LED.

So naturally, if you make *one* release that has multiple bug fixes, you increment the patch component *once*. Leaving large gaps to account for intermediate states that *don't have a version* (not even in principle, like broken releases that have been withdrawn) makes no sense.\n\nYou could of course make a release for every single tiny change, but this is probably not desirable: It's a lot of work for you, it wastes user's time and bandwidth with frequent updates, and it results in ludicrous version numbers and release logs. There are various policies for when to release, and which works best is mostly a matter of opinion and the quirks of the project and its user base. Some common options are:\n\n* Some project release once every X time units, regardless of how many or few changes were done.\n* Some projects release once a subjective threshold of \"enough changes\" is reached.\n* Some projects have milestones: \"We'll release vX.Y once we have this thing and that thing done\".\n* A mix of the above.\n\nMost projects, even when they normally adhere to one of the above, can release out\\-of\\-line hot fixes when a particular nasty bug was released in the wild.\n\nConversely, if you put out new releases so rarely (or never) that most people just track git `master`, then you fail at semver because these people don't get any backwards compatibility guarantees.

What interesting things can happen?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider a lever like this:\n\n[![Lever](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pu2Wk.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pu2Wk.gif)\n\nAs we all learned at school, if we apply a force $F$ at the long end we get a larger force:\n\n$$ F' \\= F \\\\frac ab $$\n\nat the short end, and if $a \\> b$ then the force applied at the short end is larger than the force we apply at the long end.\n\nNow put a $90$\u00b0 bend in the lever so it looks like this:\n\n[![Lever](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8hJg.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8hJg.gif)\n\nSo the force at the short end is the same except that it is now applied horizontally not vertically. This is how the forces work in your gate:\n\n[![Gate](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFnWh.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFnWh.gif)\n\nThe force being applied at the long end is the weight of the gate $mg$. If we take the top hinge as the pivot then the horizontal component of the force at the bottom hinge is $F \\= mg(a/b)$ just as in our right angled lever.\n\nWhy did I say *horizontal component of the force at the bottom hinge*? Well it's because there are other forces acting as well. The weight of the gate presses down with a force $mg$, but since the gate is not moving vertically there must be an equal and opposite force exerted by the ground at the bottom of the gate post. This force acts on the gate through the hinges, so assuming the two hinges carry the vertical load equally each hinge experiences an additional vertical force of $mg/2$.\n\nSo each hinge experiences a horizontal force $mg(a/b)$ and a vertical force $mg/2$ making the total force at each hinge:\n\n$$ F\\_{\\\\textrm{hinge}} \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(mg \\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{mg}{2}\\\\right)^2} \\= mg\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} $$\n\nSo depending on the dimensions of the gate the forces at the hinges can be greater or less than the weight of the gate. The condition for the forces at the hinges to be greater than the weight is:\n\n$$ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac ab\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} \\\\ge 1 $$\n\nNote that $a$ is half the width of the gate so let's replace it by $a \\= w/2$ where $w$ is the width of the gate, and we'll assume the hinge spacing $b$ is approximately the height of the gate. Then our condition can be written as:\n\n$$ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{2h}\\\\right)^2 \\+ \\\\frac14} \\\\ge 1 $$\n\ngiving us:\n\n$$ \\\\frac wh \\\\ge \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac32} $$\n\nThough in practice the vertical load probably isn't shared equally between the hinges so this is a best case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A rectangular gate of mass m, width w, and height h is supported by two hinges at the top and bottom of one side.

For this force to be greater than the weight of the gate, we need:\n\n\u221a((w/2h)\u00b2 + 1/4) > 1\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n(w/2h)\u00b2 + 1/4 > 1\n(w/2h)\u00b2 > 3/4\nw/h > \u221a(3/2)\n\nTherefore, the condition for the force on each hinge to be greater than the gate's weight is w/h > \u221a(3/2), which corresponds to option A.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it states the opposite condition.\nOption C would result in the force being equal to the weight, not greater.\nOption D provides a condition that is too stringent and not based on the derived equation."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/11", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/31241", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/7379/"], "docs_id": 31241, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I downloaded a Nature style file from [here](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/nature/) but I don't see any images when I build my figures.

That is you are considering that you can make the error asymptotically stable with the appropriate choice of $u.$ My interpretation of your question is:\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two IO stable systems IO stable? (Where IO Stable can mean whatever type of stability you want it to mean)\n\nFor all practical purposes this is what you are asking since we can always absorb a sign into one of the system's outputs and ask that question for $e' \\= y\\_1 \\+ y\\_2\\.$ Now, this is still not obviously true. For example, Arastas' combined system is not controllable. In particular, note that the stacked system is\n\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\dot{x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\&\\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\-1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} {x}\\_1 \\\\\\\\ {x}\\_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\ \\-1 \\\\end{pmatrix} u, \\\\\\\\ y \\&\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the Kalman Controllability Conditions and verify a lack of controllability. However, it is stabilizable! The eigenvalues of the system matrix remain negative. In fact, this is true for any stacked systems that are otherwise **decoupled**. The eigenvalues of the combined system are necessarily the union of eigenvalues. So if you have two systems whose system matrix is Hurwitz, then the stacked state also has a Hurwitz system matrix. Moreover, if both systems are controllable, you at the minimum have stabilizability. And, of course, if all the states decay, clearly the output $y :\\= x\\_1 \\- x\\_2 \\\\to 0$ as well.\n\nOf course, by stacking the system, it should be made clear that the feedback used to stabilize the system *may be different* than the feedback used to stabilize the individual subsystems. As does the nature of the stability. That shouldn't be surprising. However, my interpretation of your question is that $u$ is the same in both, but not a\\-priori fixed. So under that interpretation this is reasonable.\n\nNow, what about in the nonlinear case. Clearly, even in the linear case, you are going to lose modes of controllability and so that is likely to highly constrain the nonlinear case (and being nonlinear the problem gets harder). First off, recognize that if both systems can be linearized, have Hurwitz jacobians and are controllable we can just defer to the above result. So let us consider the other cases. This is where it gets tricky. One place to look is passivity and that is not a bad place to look since you are already considering Lyapunov stability. Assuming you absorb a sign in the right place and prove that the sign flipped system is passive (i.e. you proved the map $u\\_2\\\\mapsto \\-y\\_2$ is passive) you can consider\n\n> When is the parallel interconnection of two passive systems, passive?\n\nAlways. Once the combined system is passive, you can stabilize it with a strictly passive feedback to get $L\\_2$ stability ($L\\_2$ inputs produce $L\\_2$ outputs).\n\nYou can also consider feedback interconnections and cleverly organize your inputs and outputs to get some input to the error is passive probably. However all of these considerations depend highly on the system you are considering as they are quite restrictive! There are a wide variety of tools available that, once you have determined a system and specific category of stability, could be leveraged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Consider two nonlinear systems with stable equilibria at x\u2081 = x\u2082 = 0:\n\u1e8b\u2081 = f(x\u2081, u)\n\u1e8b\u2082 = g(x\u2082, u)\nwhere x\u2081, x\u2082 \u2208 \u211d\u207f and u is an identical input to both systems.

This eliminates option A. Option B is too restrictive, as stability can be achieved in some cases even when f \u2260 g.

For linear systems, if both systems are asymptotically stable and controllable, the stacked system is at least stabilizable.\n2. For nonlinear systems, passivity theory can be applied.

How should this affect lists such as the [Largest Known Primes](http://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php)?\n\nLet me give a little more detail to demonstrate why I feel this question is not entirely trivial or fanciful. \n\nFirstly, the requirement that the function be able to concretely generate primes is meant to avoid 'stupid' examples such as Nextprime(n) which, given a 'largest known prime' P, yields a larger prime Nextprime(P). Note however that the definition of Nextprime does not actually explicitly state what this prime is, any implementation of it (in Maple or Mathematica for example) simply loops through the integers bigger than the input, testing each for primality in some fashion.\n\nOn the other hand, one candidate for such a function might be the Catalan sequence defined by:\n\n$C(0\\) \\= 2$, $C(n\\+1\\) \\= 2^{C(n)}\\-1$\n\nAlthough $C(5\\) \\= 2^{170141183460469231731687303715884105727}\\-1$ is far too large to test by current methods (with rougly $10^{30}$ times as many digits as the current largest known prime), and although the current consensus is that $C(5\\)$ is likely composite, it does not seem entirely out of the realm of possibility that someone might eventually find some very clever way of showing $C(5\\)$ is prime, or even that $C(n)$ is always prime, or perhaps some other concretely defined sequence.\n\nThe point is this: once one knows that every element of a sequence is prime, does this entirely negate things like the list of largest known primes? Or does the fact that $C(n)$ for $n\\\\geq 5$ has too many digits to ever calculate all of them (instead only being able to calculate the first few or last few digits) mean that even if they were somehow proven prime it would not technically be 'known'?\n\nNote also that in the realm of finite simple groups the analogous question is already tough to decide since there are infinite families of such groups known, but concrete descriptions (such as generators and relations or character tables) are not always available or even computable within reasonable time constraints. Likewise one could pose analogous questions in other branches (largest volume manifolds with certain constraints, etc.)\n\nAnyhow, it seems like a reasonable question for serious mathematicians to consider, so I just want to hear what other's opinions are on the subject (and if anyone can think of a better title, feel free to suggest).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, I don't think the idea that \"knowing a prime requires knowing its decimal expansion\" accords well with mathematical practice. Unless I'm mistaken, the largest known primes are all Mersenne primes, and (for good reason!) are almost always written in the form p\\=2k\\-1, not by their decimal expansions. Granted, the currently\\-known Mersennes are small enough that one *could* calculate their decimal expansions in Maple or Mathematica, if for some reason one wanted to. But even if that weren't the case (say, if k had 10,000 digits), I'd still be perfectly happy to describe p\\=2k\\-1 as a \"known prime,\" provided someone knew both k and a proof that p was prime.\n\nOn the other hand, similar to what you suggested with your \"NextPrime\" function, what about\n\np :\\= the 1010^10000th prime number ?\n\nCertainly p exists, and one can even write a program to output it. But is p therefore \"known\"? Saying so seems to stretch the meaning of the word \"known\" beyond recognition.\n\nTrying to arrive at some principled criterion that separates the two examples above, here's the best that I came up with:\n\n***An n\\-digit prime number p is \"known\" if there's a known algorithm to output the digits of p that runs in poly(n) time (together with a proof that the algorithm does indeed output a prime number and halt in poly(n) steps).***\n\n(Strictly speaking, the above definition covers \"known\\-ness\" for infinite families of primes, rather than individual primes \\-\\- since once you fix p, you can always output it in O(1\\) time. But this is a standard caveat.)\n\nAs far as I can see, the above definition correctly captures the intuition that a prime p is \"known\" if we know a closed\\-form formula for p (which can be evaluated in polynomial time), but *not* if we merely know a non\\-constructive definition of p (for which it takes exponential time to determine which p we're talking about).\n\nA very interesting test case for my definition is\n\np :\\= the first prime larger than 1010^10000.\n\nAccording to my definition, the above prime is currently \"unknown\", but will become \"known\" if someone proves the conjecture that the spacing between two consecutive n\\-digit primes never exceeds q(n) for some fixed polynomial q.\n\nIf you accept my definition, then a \"function that always generates primes\" almost certainly *would* trivialize largest\\-prime contests, since presumably it would give a deterministic way to generate n\\-digit primes in nO(1\\) time, for n as large as you like (which is not something that we currently have).\n\nNow, maybe there are cases where my definition fails to match up with \"intuitive knowability\" \\-\\- if so, I look forward to seeing counterexamples!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, which of the following best describes when an n-digit prime number p is considered \"known\"?\n\nA) When its decimal expansion can be fully calculated using software like Maple or Mathematica\n\nB) When there exists a known algorithm to output its digits in poly(n) time, along with a proof of its primality and runtime\n\nC) When it can be expressed in the form 2^k - 1, where k is known\n\nD) When it can be defined non-constructively, even if determining which prime it is takes exponential time\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer directly states that \"An n-digit prime number p is 'known' if there's a known algorithm to output the digits of p that runs in poly(n) time (together with a proof that the algorithm does indeed output a prime number and halt in poly(n) steps).\" This matches option B exactly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the answer explicitly states that knowing a prime doesn't necessarily require knowing its decimal expansion.\n\nOption C, while related to Mersenne primes which are often used as examples of large known primes, is not the general definition provided in the answer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the answer specifically contrasts polynomial-time algorithms with non-constructive definitions that take exponential time, considering the latter as not meeting the criteria for a \"known\" prime."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/06", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/314843", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/144475/"], "docs_id": 314843, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been working on a Wifi gardening project that allows me to water plants from anywhere I want.

In [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibronic_transition), about vibronic transitions it says \"Most processes leading to the absorption and emission of visible light, are due to vibronic transitions. This may be contrasted to pure electronic transitions which occur in atoms and lead to sharp monochromatic lines (e.g. in a sodium vapor lamp) or pure vibrational transitions which only absorb or emit infrared light.\". Does this mean infrared radiation is emitted without electrons playing a direct part?\nWhat about changing in molecular rotational energies?\nAlso, I understand reflection is not a radiation absorption\\-emission phenomena, so can you explain what actually happens to the photons? Same thing for radiation scattering.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Regarding the general question posed in the title, yes, it is possible in general to have photon emission (or absorption) without electrons changing energy levels. For example, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), EM radiation (photons) are absorbed and re\\-emitted with changes in nuclear spin state. NMR spectroscopy relies on splitting between nuclear spin states due to a large applied magnetic field. This splitting causes absorption and stimulated emission of EM radiation with energy equal to the splitting. So NMR is one example of photon emission without changes in electronic energy levels playing a direct role.\n\nHowever, with regards to your specific examples, electrons *are* directly involved. In the vibrational modes, the resonant frequencies are determined by the stiffnesses of the molecular bonds. Those stiffnesses in turn depend on the electronic structure of the molecule. The question is, how much does the electronic energy change when the bond lengths and angles are changed by small amounts? This can be calculated using electronic structure packages like Gaussian and ABINIT. The nuclei are also involved; the masses of the nuclei also factor into the resonant frequencies. The picture is similar for (dihedral) rotation of chemical bonds."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is correct regarding molecular vibrational transitions and the emission of infrared radiation?\n\nA) Infrared radiation emission from molecular vibrations occurs without any involvement of electrons.\n\nB) Electrons change energy levels during molecular vibrational transitions, similar to electronic transitions in atoms.\n\nC) Molecular vibrational frequencies depend on both the electronic structure and the masses of the nuclei in the molecule.\n\nD) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an example of infrared radiation emission from molecular vibrations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because electrons are involved in determining the stiffness of molecular bonds, which affects vibrational frequencies. \nOption B is incorrect because while electrons are involved, they don't change energy levels in the same way as in electronic transitions. \nOption C is correct as it accurately describes how both electronic structure (which determines bond stiffness) and nuclear masses contribute to vibrational frequencies. \nOption D is incorrect because NMR involves radio frequency radiation, not infrared, and deals with nuclear spin states rather than molecular vibrations."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/18595", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/5410/"], "docs_id": 18595, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am working on a DEM that in an area where there is little relief. \n\nI would like to 'burn' the river network into the DEM so I can calculate flow accumulation and flow length accurately. \n\nI am using ArcGIS Desktop 10\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Convert](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Polyline_to_Raster/001200000031000000/) your stream vectors to raster with a value of 1 and the same extent and cellsize as your DEM.

After reading a lot of stuff, I came to two different solutions:\n\n1. In the first one, each microservice only serve one or a very few HTTP requests. This is good because if one microsevice is down, only a small part of my previous big app is down, but the rest is still working. However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. For example, each of them has more or less the same code to generate an XML template or send request to the southbound system. I know it can be overcome by using a shared library, but then each microservice needs to use the same programming language.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMSnf.png)\n2. Splitting the part of my app to smaller services. Here, I avoid code duplication and each service can use a different programming language, but if a single microservice is down, everything stops working.

It seems maybe a bit easier to understand and maintain, but not really giving anything more.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqaXz.png)\n\nI would like to have your opinion on my personal use case as I really struggle to understand how an application in a microservice world should be designed without a concrete example.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The objective of [microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) is to provide **independently deployable, loosely coupled, lean services**. This means that you shall be able to change one of the microservices however you want, and can deploy it in production without changing the others. \n\nYour scenario 1 indeed breaks the monolith down into smaller pieces. But these are not independently deployable: \n\n> However, there is a lot of code duplication between each microservice. (...) I know it can be overcome by using a shared library,\n\nIf you change some functionality in the shared code, you no longer are sure that it's interoperable with the other service. And if shared library is changed, you're no longer sure that the other service still compiles and could be patched for an emergency issue within minutes. \n\nYour focus seems to be reliability and continuity of the microservices that you have extracted from your legacy monolith. But the common code weakens the independent continuity of services: if you have for example a vulnerability in your shared library, both services could easily be disrupted by the same hacker. Or suffer from the same nasty UB bug. \n\nThe reliability achieved with microservice is based on true independence on the functional axis. The focus is also more on scalability (see the [scale cube](https://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html)): microservices can offer horizontal duplication (i.e. several service instances for the same API \\- if one breaks down, the clones continue to work), not to speak about partitioning. \n\nFor scenario 2, you could consider implementing fault tolerance by implementing horizontal scalability, i.e. having several instances of the same service running on different nodes. It's a tough change since the services have to find each other dynamically. But then, if one of the service instance is down in the chain, the other services upstream can find another working instance. A trick for achieveing this is to move from a [synchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/rpi.html) to [asynchronous communication](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html) via event queues or a message broker. \n\nIt's difficult based on the few elements you provide to confirm if approach 2 is the best one. Perhaps another [decomposition strategy](https://chrisrichardson.net/post/refactoring/2019/10/09/refactoring-to-microservices.html) could result in even lower coupling. \n\nI could for example think of this one, which combines both of your approaches: migrating your common XML generator features into a \"Service Proxy\" (the name is arbitrary: it seemed to be a relay between your new microservices and other applications), splitting the core of the monolith into [highly cohesive but loosely coupled capabilities](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/decompose-by-business-capability.html), and hiding the details of the split to the outside world behind an [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html): \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSRYd.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is refactoring their monolithic application into microservices.

Determine the total transmissions per second: 10 sensors * (1/60) transmissions per second = 1/6 transmissions per second.\n2. Calculate the vulnerable time window: Since a collision can occur if another transmission starts up to 20ms before or after the transmission in question, the vulnerable window is 60ms (20ms + 20ms + 20ms).\n3. Calculate the expected number of other transmissions in this window: (1/6) * 0.06 seconds = 0.01\n4. Use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability of 1 or more other transmissions in this window: 1 - P(0 transmissions) = 1 - e^(-0.01) \u2248 0.00995\n5. Convert to percentage: 0.00995 * 100 \u2248 1%\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that a collision can occur with transmissions starting before or after.

What happened that causes Perl to lose its applicability as server language?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The model for web programming in the 90's was to launch an application that used the [common gateway interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) to launch another process that was forked by the web server.\n\nForking a process is a rather heavy weight operation. For perl, this means spinning up the interpreter, running it, and then letting the process terminate. When working with heavy loads, this became prohibitively expensive (memory and cpu).\n\nFastCGI reduced the overhead of CGIs by reusing the process, cutting back on the heavy forking of a process. This is more inline with application servers, which leads us to...\n\nThe development approach today is to have an application server in a language that has a light weight process threading model, which can handle very large loads (compared to the days of CGI). Of these you have Java, Go, and C\\# which follow this approach.\n\nThis doesn't mean perl is out. There are application servers for Perl. One rarely hears of Catalyst compared to things such as Zope, NodeJS, or the plethora of Java App servers.\n\nPart of this is timing. While the development of Java application servers was going on, Perl has been a bit bogged down with work on perl 6 (any ~~day~~ year now) and so the community as a whole let that development path slip by.\n\nI *personally* discount the discipline of languages as a reason that perl has missed out pointing to javascript, php and ruby as three examples of similarly undisciplined languages that remain popular in the web area.\n\nLanguages such as Java and C\\# (and to an extent, python) with major company backing (Sun/Oracle, Microsoft, Google) and, yes, more discipline in the language are more appealing to enterprise development."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes why Perl lost popularity as a server-side language for web development compared to languages like Java, Python, and C#?\n\nA) Perl's syntax became too complex for modern web development needs.\nB) The rise of application servers and lightweight threading models favored other languages.\nC) Perl's performance significantly degraded over time.\nD) Perl lacked proper documentation and community support.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation explains that the web development model shifted from CGI and FastCGI to application servers with lightweight threading models. Languages like Java, Go, and C# were better suited for this approach. While Perl has application servers like Catalyst, they didn't gain as much traction as others. The focus on Perl 6 development also contributed to the community missing out on the application server trend.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question of syntax complexity isn't mentioned as a factor in Perl's decline.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no mention of Perl's performance degrading. In fact, the move from CGI to FastCGI was partly to improve performance for Perl and other languages.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation doesn't suggest a lack of documentation or community support for Perl.
