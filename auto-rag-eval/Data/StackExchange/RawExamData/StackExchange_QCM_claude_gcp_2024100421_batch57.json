This is achieved through a combination of decorations and path constructions. \n\nThe style uses 'show path construction' to break down the path into its constituent segments, and then applies a 'markings' decoration to each segment. This decoration places an arrow at the midpoint of each line segment, parallel to it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the style doesn't draw the main triangle shape; it adds decorations to existing paths.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the paths are drawn cyclically, this is not the primary purpose of the 'parallel arrows' style.\n\nOption D is partially true (the arrows are indeed red), but this is just a small part of what the style does, not its primary purpose.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately describes the main function of this custom style, which is to automatically add parallel arrows to each line segment of the paths it's applied to."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/14", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/294262", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/2886003/"], "docs_id": 294262, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I commented on [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30209066/2886003).

I've narrowed that down to a problem where PostGIS can not select a Spatial Reference System using Proj4 text.\n\nOne of the main limitations is that I'm dealing with many geospatial locations, and I don't actually know which CRS I'm working with for each one; I only know that they're using the MGA UTM datum, they're located in Australia, and they have a northing, easting and zone which I am given.\n\nI figure I should be able to use the Proj4 text string in order to get the correct CRS like this, because the Proj4 string is consistent for these CRSs except for the zone:\n\n```\nfrom django.contrib.gis.gdal import SpatialReference\nproj = \"+proj=utm +zone=%d +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs\" % zone\nsrs = SpatialReference(proj)\n\n```\n\nIs this a reasonable approach?

The EPSG numbers for UTM zones follow a pattern that incorporates the zone number. For UTM south zones (which apply to Australia), the pattern is 327ZZ, where ZZ is the two-digit zone number. Therefore, you can simply add the zone number to 32700 to get the correct SRID. This method is fast, doesn't require database queries or external libraries, and works consistently for all southern hemisphere UTM zones.\n\nOption A is unreliable as the question states that using Proj4 strings to determine the SRID wasn't working correctly.

So my real question is... **Is there a written formal policy on how to handle duplicate questions/answers on Ask Ubuntu?**\n\nI have my own opinion on this subject, but I'll start by asking readers to review the comments in [unable to detect wireless after installing ubuntu 16\\.10: Broadcom bcm43212](https://askubuntu.com/questions/885031/unable-to-detect-wireless-after-installing-ubuntu-16-10-broadcom-bcm43212/885053#885053).\n\nOne might condense one answer that I've been given as... \"we don't want to clog up Ask Ubuntu with similar answers... so mark it as a dup question and reference a dup answer\".\n\nOne problem that I see with marking as a dup, and providing a link, is that **many** times the link doesn't answer the **specifics** of the **current** question. Case in point, the BCM43212\\. The dup link refered to makes **no mention** of the BCM43212, and even if you went off of the device ID (which wasn't identified in the OP), you'd get a call out to an obsolete driver quoted in 2011\\. **Wrong answer**.\n\nI'll try and keep this short...\n\nI see 6 possible answers to **any** given question...\n\n1. no answer at all\n2. a brand new answer to a brand new question\n3. a similar question marked as having a dup answer, link provided\n4. a similar question having the same/similar answer\n5. a similar question marked as dup, link provided, and having a same/similar answer\n6. wrong answer\n\nI'm not sure that considering items 2\\-5 should be considered as different. **The question got answered**.\n\nComments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your answer is addressing the specifics of the current question and is sufficiently different, then yes, it may well be better to post it. Sometimes, you can post your answer addressing the specifics *and* vote to close as a dupe. Or, which I often do, vote to close and leave a comment along the lines of \"Use the solution of the duplicate, just change `foo` to `bar`\".\n\nHowever, the flak you've been getting is because you've been posting *the exact same answer to multiple questions*. That raises an automatic moderator flag since, obviously, it is duplication of content. There have been 22 (twenty two!) separate flags raised on your answers for that! These aren't cases where you \"answer the specifics of the current question\", these are 100%, word for word identical copies of another one of your answers. \n\n9 times out of 10, when a post is flagged in such a way, the question it is answering is indeed a duplicate and should have been marked as such. Yes, sometimes the questions aren't close enough even though they have the same answer, but that is very rare. Which is why the system casts this flag to begin with. \n\nSo, if you feel that the duplicate doesn't answer the question well enough, then post a *different* answer that does address whatever detail you feel is missing. However, arguing that it shouldn't be a dupe because the specifics of the question are different, and then posting word\\-perfect identical answers doesn't make much sense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the recommended approach when encountering a question on Ask Ubuntu that is similar to an existing one, but has some specific differences?\n\nA) Always mark it as a duplicate and provide a link to the existing question, regardless of the differences.\nB) Post an identical answer to the one given for the existing similar question.\nC) Post a new answer addressing the specifics of the current question, and consider voting to close as a duplicate if appropriate.\nD) Ignore the question entirely to avoid potential duplication.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The recommended approach is to post a new answer that addresses the specifics of the current question if it's sufficiently different from existing ones. Additionally, if the question is still fundamentally similar to an existing one, you can consider voting to close it as a duplicate. This approach ensures that the specific details of the new question are addressed while also maintaining the integrity of the Q&A format by linking to relevant existing information.

I know there is a problem with dynamic storage allocation if we do away with the Heap, but isn't there a way around this, or perhaps, a way to improve on the Stack so that it can handle dynamic memory allocation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem with stacks is that you can't \"free\" memory unless it is on top of the stack. For instance, say you allocated 3 things of varying sizes:\n\n```\na = allocate(2000000); // 2000000 bytes\nb = allocate(1);\nc = allocate(5000000);\n\n```\n\nThe stack would have `a` on the bottom, `b` in the middle, and `c` on top. This becomes problematic if we want to free `b`:\n\n```\nfree(b); // b is not on top! We have to wait until c is freed!\n\n```\n\nThe workaround is to move all the data after `b` and shift if so that it comes after `a`. This works, but will require **5000000** copies in this case \\- something that will be much slower than a heap.\n\nThis is why we have a heap. While allocation may be slower than a stack (`O(log n)` vs `O(1)`), heaps allow freeing memory at an arbitrary location to be fast \\- `O(log n)`, compared to a stack's `O(n)`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In memory management, why can't we replace both Stack and Heap with just a Stack for all memory allocation needs?\n\nA) Stacks are always faster than Heaps for all operations, so using only a Stack would improve performance.\n\nB) Stacks cannot handle dynamic memory allocation, making them unsuitable for all use cases.\n\nC) While Stacks are faster for allocation, they have limitations in freeing memory at arbitrary locations, which can lead to inefficiency in certain scenarios.\n\nD) Heaps are always more efficient than Stacks, so we should use only Heaps instead.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While Stacks are indeed faster for allocation (O(1) compared to Heap's O(log n)), they have a significant limitation when it comes to freeing memory. In a Stack, you can only free memory from the top, which becomes problematic when you need to free memory in the middle of the Stack. \n\nFor example, if you allocate memory for objects A, B, and C in that order, and then want to free B, you can't do so efficiently without first freeing C. This could lead to unnecessary data movement and inefficiency, especially for large allocations. \n\nIn contrast, Heaps allow for efficient freeing of memory at arbitrary locations (O(log n)), which is crucial for many applications that require dynamic memory management. This is why both Stacks and Heaps are used in modern systems, each serving different purposes based on their strengths and limitations.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they overgeneralize the efficiency of Stacks and Heaps respectively.

I guess NO, can anyone explain why?\nin this case is there a way to relate the different predictors' coefficients to have a comparative understanding?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that normalizing the coefficients will not affect the predictions, but it will mess up the estimated class probabilities. Don't do it.\n\nThe coefficients don't represent the *odds ratios* but rather the *feature weights*. They can be negative. If a coefficient is strongly positive, it means that the corresponding feature is very much correlated with the positive class. If it is strongly negative, then its means that the feature is strongly correlated with the negative class. If the coefficient is close to zero, then it means that the feature is not correlated much with either the positive or the negative class.\n\nSo if you want to compare the importance of each feature, you should compare the absolute values of the coefficients (and you can normalize them just for convenience, if you want, but don't use these normalized absolute coefficients to make predictions, only use them to compare feature importance). (**Edit**: this assumes that the features have been normalized prior to training)\n\nThis is probably all you need to know. Read on if you want to understand what would happen if you tried to normalize the coefficients.\n\nThe decision function for logistic regression is:\n\n$h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\= \\\\sigma(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i)$\n\nwhere $\\\\sigma(t) \\= \\\\dfrac{1}{1 \\+ \\\\exp(\\-t)}$ (the *logistic function*)\n\nand $\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}$ is the parameter vector, and $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is the feature vector (including a bias term $x\\_0 \\= 1$) and $n$ is the number of features.\n\nThe model's prediction $\\\\hat{y}$ for the instance $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is given by:\n\n$\n\\\\hat{y} \\=\n\\\\begin{cases}\n 0 \\& \\\\text{ if }h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\< 0\\.5\\\\\\\\\n 1 \\& \\\\text{ if }h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\ge 0\\.5\n\\\\end{cases}\n$\n\nNotice that $\\\\sigma(t) \\\\ge 0\\.5$ when $t \\\\ge 0$, and $\\\\sigma(t) \\< 0\\.5$ when $t \\< 0$ so the prediction simplifies to:\n\n$\n\\\\hat{y} \\=\n\\\\begin{cases}\n 0 \\& \\\\text{ if }\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i \\< 0\\\\\\\\\n 1 \\& \\\\text{ if }\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i \\\\ge 0\n\\\\end{cases}\n$\n\nIf you normalize the feature vector, you get the new parameter vector $\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}} \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}}{K} $. Since the coefficients can be negative, it would not make sense to divide them by the sum of coefficients (the sum could be negative or zero). So instead, let's define $K$ as the range of values (anyway, even if you choose another method for normalization, it does not change what follows).\n\n$K \\= \\\\underset{i}\\\\max(\\\\theta\\_i) \\- \\\\underset{i}\\\\min(\\\\theta\\_i)$\n\nLook at what happens to the sum used for predictions:\n\n$\n\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\_i x\\_i \\= \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\dfrac{\\\\theta\\_i}{K} x\\_i \\= \\\\dfrac{1}{K}\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i\n$\n\nEverything just got multiplied by the constant $\\\\dfrac{1}{K}$.\n\nIf $K \\> 0$, the predictions don't change a bit, since $\\\\dfrac{1}{K} \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i$ has the same sign as $\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i$. If $K \\= 0$ (which can only happen if all coefficients are equal), then $K$ is not defined (you can't normalize the coefficients). If you use another normalization technique, and end up with $K\\<0$, then all predictions get reversed, which is probably not a good idea!\n\nSo normalizing the coefficients (by dividing them by their range of values) will not affect predictions. However, it will mess up the decision function $h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}$. This function is used to estimate the probability of the positive class. By multiplying all coefficients by $\\\\dfrac{1}{K}$, you will end up making the same predictions (since the sign is not affected), but the estimated probability will be higher or lower depending on the value of $K$. For example, if $K \\= 2$ then:\n\n$h\\_\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{\\\\theta}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\= \\\\sigma(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\_i x\\_i) \\= \\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{2} \\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\theta\\_i x\\_i\\\\right)$\n\nThis can't be simplified much: if you plot the curve of $\\\\sigma(t)$ and compare it to $\\\\sigma(\\\\frac{1}{2}t)$, you will find that this updated model will be much less confident about its predictions.

A FXO VoIP gateway is basically a VoIP server that's connected to a telephone line. A FXS VoIP interface is basically a VoIP client that uses a regular telephone as its input and output device. In theory, any device capable of being a FXO server should be able to be a FXS client as well, because the interface hardware is basically the same... but if you can find a FXS adapter, it'll probably be cheaper than buying two FXO servers.\n\nDon't take my word for it without further research (it's been about 10 years since I last looked into it), but I think at least one member of the Linksys SPA\\-3xxx family can be used for this purpose if you buy a pair of them... basically, each box has an ethernet port, a FXO jack, and a FXS jack.

Also, there are two passwords... one of which is necessary for \"advanced\" settings and can NOT be factory reset.

His skills and Items:\n\n```\nQ: 260 + 60%  AP\nW: 320 + 100% AP\nR: 500 + 120% AP + 80% enemy AP\nDeathfire Grasp: 20% of Target Health and + 20% magic damage increase\nLichbane: 75% Base AD + 50% AP (75% Base AD of veigar on lvl 18 = 71.625)\nArcane Blade: 5% AP\n\n```\n\nCan hit in under 2 seconds. It is very possible to gain 1000 AP in a game with veigar with a normal build but I wouldn't recommend buying Lichbane a lot but I'll include it here for the highest possible burst damage in under 2 seconds.\n\nNow If you open up with DFG you'll already have 20% of the enemies HP and a 20% magic damage increase. \n\nThis means you can hit for a total of: **20% HP \\+ 1381\\.95 \\+ 392% AP \\+ 96% Enemy AP** with DFG, Your Skills and an autoattack.\n\nLet's say you're up against a Syndra on level 18 with 2000 HP, 600 AP and 100 Magic resistance while you have farmed up to get exactly 1000 AP. \n\nIf you full Combo Her you'd hit her for: \n\n```\n400 (20% HP) +\n3920 (392 % of your AP) +\n576 (96% of her AP) +\n1382 (Base damage rounded up)\n_______________________________\n6278 Raw damage\n\n```\n\nNow even if you take her Magic resistance into account you'll still deal **3139 damage** which is pretty much an overkill. So this is one of the more realistic burst scenarios but of course it differs from situation to situation.\n\nIn the end most champions that are designed to burst someone down have a huge damage potential and are good at their role.

Assuming Veigar uses his full combo including Deathfire Grasp (DFG), what is the approximate total damage dealt to Syndra after accounting for her Magic Resistance?\n\nA) 2500 damage\nB) 3139 damage\nC) 4500 damage\nD) 6278 damage\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of damage calculation, including ability power scaling, item effects, and magic resistance. \n\nThe raw damage calculation is provided in the text:\n400 (20% HP from DFG) + 3920 (392% of Veigar's AP) + 576 (96% of Syndra's AP) + 1382 (Base damage) = 6278 Raw damage\n\nHowever, this raw damage needs to be reduced by Syndra's Magic Resistance. With 100 Magic Resistance, damage is reduced by 50%. Therefore, the final damage is approximately 6278 / 2 = 3139.\n\nAnswer A is too low, not accounting for Veigar's high AP and full combo.\nAnswer C is too high, not properly accounting for Magic Resistance.\nAnswer D is the raw damage before Magic Resistance is applied.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret complex game mechanics, understand AP scaling, and apply damage reduction calculations."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/28", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43924", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/7732/"], "docs_id": 43924, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by a [riddle](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/8101/iterated-polynomial-problem) in math.stackexchange.\n\nLet $P$ be a polynomial, and $O \\= \\\\{P^{(n)}(0\\) : n \\\\geq 0\\\\}$ be its orbit under zero (viewed as a set).

They created new symbols for each \"level\", and each with its own corresponding `.lib` file that is referenced. The problem is that they no longer include the `UniversalOpamps2.sub` file anymore with any new LTspice installation. This breaks any subcircuit which relies on this file being present. I knew this broke several user\\-created models, but it sounds like Analog Devices' own `ADN8834.sub` references the same deprecated `UniversalOpamps2.sub`. This looks to be an error on their part, and I don't know how many other of their proprietary models have the same issue. Unfortunately, we can't simply go into `ADN8834.sub` and tweak it to use one of the new `UniversalOpampX` models instead because it is a proprietary encrypted `.sub` file. Therefore, I would email \"LTspice@analog.com\" to inform them of the issue so they can fix it in a future release.\n\n---\n\nIn the meantime, I would suggest downloading and installing LTspiceIV which can be found [on the main LTspice download page](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) under the link titled \"Download for Windows XP (End of Support)\". After installation, you can navigate to (assuming C: drive) `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\LTC\\LTspiceIV\\lib\\sub` and find `UniversalOpamps2.sub`. Copy this file to `C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\Documents\\LTspiceXVII\\lib\\sub` and launch LTspiceXVII. Try running the ADN8834 simulation again and it should work now. You can also uninstall LTspiceIV after you successfully copied the `UniversalOpamps2.sub` file over. One thing to note is that your file associations will be messed up by doing all this, so you can launch the LTspiceXVII installer again (same download page as above, click \"Download for Windows 7, 8, and 10\") and it will give you the option to overwrite your existing installation.

Let's say that I lift the 10kg dumbell off the ground with a certain force 'F'.\nNow let's say I use the same force 'F' to lift the 1kg dumbbell. Naturally, I would lift the 1kg dumbell much faster, right?\n\nNow coming to electric motors, let's say I attach a 10kg load to the motor shaft. The motor would produce a torque T and rotate at a certain rpm. Now, I put 1kg load on the shaft. \nAs per the dumbell analogy, wouldn't the 1kg load cause an increase in speed because it's lighter than 10kg?\n\nBut we know that a motor's torque keeps changing with the load. So for a 1kg load, does the motor produce *just enough torque required to rotate* a 1kg load?\n If yes, how would the motor *know* what the load is so as to produce the right amount of torque?\nIf no, them wouldn't the motor produce the same amount of torque for all loads and only the rpm keeps changing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming we are talking about a shunt wound or permanent magnet brushed DC or BLDC motor, torque is proportional to current, so the more torque load you put on the motor the more current it will draw to match it. However the current causes a voltage drop in the winding resistance, which reduces rpm. How much the rpm drops depends on the resistance. A large motor with thick low resistance wire could lift a heavy weight without its rpm dropping significantly, while a small motor with thinner wire might drop down to stall speed and not draw enough current to lift the heavy weight at all.\n\nTo understand the relationships between torque, current, rpm and voltage, consider this simplified model of a PMDC motor:\\-\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DBee0.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fDBee0.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nWhen the motor spins it generates a voltage proportional to its speed. This is a result of [Faraday's Law](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/farlaw.html#c1), which says that moving a wire through a magnetic field induces a voltage in it proportional to its velocity, and occurs whether it is driven by an external force or by its own power. Depending on how it is constructed (number of turns, size, stator or armature slots, magnet poles etc.) each motor has a characteristic 'Kv' (Velocity constant), commonly expressed in rad/s/Volt or rpm/Volt. \n\nOutput torque is proportional to current according the [Lorentz force law](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/magfor.html#c1), which says that the magnetic force on a wire is proportional to current x magnetic field strength (which is constant in a permanent magnet or shunt wound DC motor). For a particular motor this relationship is a constant, called Kt (Torque constant), often expressed in N.m/A. \n\nBy symmetry, Kt is the inverse of Kv. So if you know one then you know the other. If Kv \\= 10\\.5 rad/s/V (100 rpm/V) then Kt must be 0\\.095 N.m/A. \n\nFor this simplified model we will ignore any internal losses due to magnetic hysteresis, eddy currents, friction and air drag. If the motor has no load then torque and current are zero, and no voltage is dropped across Rm. That means the generator voltage must equal the supply voltage, and the motor must be spinning at 100 rpm/V \\* 10V \\= 1000 rpm. \n\nNow put an external torque load on the motor. It will slow down and produce less voltage, causing voltage to be dropped across Rm. By Ohms Law a current must then flow, producing torque. Speed continues to drop and current rises until output torque matches the externally applied torque. \n\nIf the torque load is high enough to stop the motor spinning then there is no generator voltage and the full 10V is dropped across Rm, causing a current of 10V/1\u03a9 \\= 10A. With Kt \\= 0\\.095 N.m/A and current \\= 10A, the 'stall' torque must be 0\\.95 N.m. \n\nNow imagine an otherwise identical motor which has thicker wire, reducing Rm to 0\\.1\u03a9. The same 10A current (producing the same 0\\.95 N.m torque) now only drops 1V across Rm, so the generator must be producing 9V. This motor must be spinning at 9\\*100 \\= 900 rpm (only 10% less than the no\\-load speed) while lifting the weight that stalled the other motor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A permanent magnet DC motor has a velocity constant (Kv) of 100 rpm/V and a winding resistance (Rm) of 0.5\u03a9.

No-load speed: At no load, the back EMF equals the supply voltage. Therefore, the no-load speed is 100 rpm/V * 12V = 1200 rpm.\n\n2. Stall torque: At stall, all voltage is dropped across Rm. The stall current is 12V / 0.5\u03a9 = 24A. \n   To find Kt (torque constant), we use the relationship Kt = 1/Kv:\n   Kt = 1 / (100 rpm/V * 2\u03c0/60) = 0.0955 N.m/A\n   Stall torque = Kt * stall current = 0.0955 * 24 = 2.28 N.m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: No-load speed: 1200 rpm, Stall torque: 2.28 N.m."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/06", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/45973", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1393/"], "docs_id": 45973, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am just flabbergasted about the fact that I can't for the life of me find a single torch in all of Whiterun.

You need to specify three points with `\\tizkmark` rather than two because TikZ has no way of knowing which of the groups of words being marked is longer. If the bottom group is longer as in the first example, only two marks would be needed, but this won't work in the second example where the top group is longer, so you need to mark both the beginning and end of the top group and just the end of the bottom group.\n\nA simple version\n----------------\n\nUsing the `tikzmark` package (see complicated version below) introduces some complexity into this solution that is really not necessary for this purpose (although can be useful in other contexts). Specifically, the solution above requires a unique set of labels for each box you use. This become annoying if you are using it a lot.\n\nBy using a simpler version of `tikzmark` that doesn't use the package, you can avoid this altogether and then have a command that simply is `\\boxit` for the default case, and you can use the same set of labels each time.\n\nIn this version, the labels use the following scheme, where `<start>` is the upper left corner mark. These *must* be numeric, and the default is to start at 1\\.\n\n```\n<start> <start+1> <start+2>\n\n```\n\nNow you can just use `\\tikzmark{1}`, `\\tikzmark{2}` ,`\\tikzmark{3}` for all boxes unless you have more than one box in a single example. In that case, increase the start numbers by 3\\.\n\nNow to box the nodes, you can use:\n\n```\n\\boxit % this assumes nodes start at 1\n\n```\n\nor to have more than one box in an example, use the starred version and give the starting node number as an argument.\n\n```\n\\boxit*{<start>} % gives an explicit start\n\n```\n\nHere's the complete example showing the two boxes in the same example, and then another box using the same `1`, `2`, `3` marks in the subsequent example.\n\nThis solution works with both the regular gloss syntax of ExPex as well as the `nlevel` syntax. For `nlevel` formatted examples you need to make sure that the `\\tikzmark` commands in the glosses are *inside* the `[ ... ]` not outside of them. For this syntax I also increased the `glspace` parameter of the glosses since the spacing seemed tighter with the `nlevel` syntax.\n\n```\n\\documentclass[10pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{expex}\n\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{fit}\n\n\\newcommand{\\tikzmark}[1]{\\tikz[remember picture,overlay] \\node (#1) {};}\n\\makeatletter\n\\newcommand{\\boxit}{\\@ifstar\\@boxit\\@@boxit}\n\\newcommand{\\@@boxit}{\\@boxit{1}}\n\\newcommand\\@boxit[1]{%\n\\tikz[overlay,remember picture]{\n\\def\\pointlist{}\n\\pgfmathsetmacro{\\endpoint}{#1+2}\n\\foreach \\x in {#1,...,\\endpoint}\n{\\xdef\\pointlist{\\pointlist(\\x)}}%\n\\node[draw,rectangle,yshift=3.5pt,thick,\n      fit=\\pointlist,\n      inner sep=1pt,text depth=\\baselineskip] {};\n}}\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla \\tikzmark{1}Si fuera\\tikzmark{2} m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{4}un jugador\\tikzmark{5} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3} more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{6} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player\u2019//\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\\boxit*{4}\n\n\\ex\n\\begingl\n\\gla Si fuera m\\'as alto ser\\'ia \\tikzmark{1}un jugador\\tikzmark{2} de baloncesto.//\n\\glb If be.3.sg.PAST.SUBJ more tall be.3.sg.COND a player\\tikzmark{3} of basketball//\n\\glft `If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player'\n\\endgl\n\\xe\n\\boxit\n\n% example with the nlevel sytax\n\n\\ex[glstyle=nlevel,glspace=.7em plus .4em minus .15em] \n\\begingl \\tikzmark{1}Si[If] fuera\\tikzmark{2}[be.3.PAST.SUBJ\\tikzmark{3}] m\\'as[more] alto[tall] ser\\'ia[be.3.sg.COND] un[a] jugador[player] de[of] baloncesto.[basketball] \n\\glft If s/he was taller, s/he would be a basketball player// \n\\endgl \\xe\n\\boxit\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n[![output of code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZN7g.png)\n\nOriginal, more complicated version\n----------------------------------\n\nHere's the original version of the answer, which requires unique nodes for each mark, and requires you to give the `\\boxit` command an argument with the appropriate label.

This is because with time\\-series data we expect statistical dependencies that make it hard to interpret the sample correlation as an estimator of a population correlation. Another issue is that correlation is a possible indicator of causal mechanisms, which doesn't make sense in your example (not that correlation *proves* a causal relationship, it may suggest it depending on the context). \n\nThat doesn't mean that interpretation is *impossible*.

Ignoring the statistical distributions aspect, a large value of the correlation suggests that a line could be drawn through the scatterplot of the bivariate data. \n\nIf you have a large correlation value between time and a time series, it could indicate a linear (mean) trend in the data.

What would be the equations used to find the intersection points the ray make with the circle and l? You are given the coordinates of C and P, the radius R and the orientation of l.\n\nI am trying to model looking from a point P onto a wheel\\-axis shape and find from point of view P the point of the edge of the circle that would appear to intersect with it's axis. Of course it doesn't but it is how this 3d structure would appear in a 2d image if a camera was situated at point P.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No need to rotate anything, it is a matter of very simple geometry, which if you follow through, gives you a very simple explicit algorithm for computing the points you need. \n\nAssume the orientation of the lines $l$ is given by a vector $\\\\vec{v}$. Then the circle, call it $k$, has given center $C$ and radius $r$ and lies in the plane $\\\\beta$ passing through $C$ and orthogonal to $\\\\vec{v}$. Denote by $s$ the ray through point $P$ that intersects both line $l$ and the circle $s$. Then, since $s$ intersects $l$, the two together determines a plane $\\\\alpha$, which is orthogonal to the plane of the circle $\\\\beta$ and is transverse to the circle itself. The ray $s$ lies in this plane $\\\\alpha$ and at the same time intersects $k$ so the ray $s$ passes through the point of intersection of $k$ and $\\\\alpha$. So all you have to do is find the intersection points of the plane $\\\\alpha$ and the circle $k$ (technically, you have two solutions of your problem). It becomes even simpler when you notice that the planes $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ (the one of the circle $k$) intersect at a common line $l\\_C$ that passes thorough the circle center $C$, that is $l\\_C \\= \\\\alpha \\\\cap \\\\beta$. Therefore the intersection points between $k$ and $\\\\alpha$ are in fact the intersection points of $l\\_C$ and $k$. In other words, the two points you are looking for are exactly $l\\_C \\\\cap k$. Which, by the way, are the two points on $l\\_C$ at a distance $r$ from point $C \\\\in l\\_C$ (on either side of $C$ on $l\\_C$). \n\nAll of the above observations prompt the following algorithm:\n\n1. If the dot product $\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big) \\< 0$ then set $\\\\vec{v} :\\= \\-\\\\vec{v}$. This way we make sure both vectors $\\\\vec{v}$ and $\\\\vec{CP}$ are in the same half space with respect to the plane $\\\\beta$ defined by the circle (recall $\\\\beta$ is orthogonal to $\\\\vec{v}$).\n2. Define vector $$\\\\vec{n} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}$$ (cross product) which is orthogonal to $\\\\alpha$, and thus orthogonal to $l\\_C$.\n3. Then define vector $$\\\\vec{w} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{n} \\= \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)$$ and normalize it to $$\\\\vec{u} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\vec{w}}{\\|\\\\vec{w}\\|} \\= \\\\frac{ \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)}{\\| \\\\vec{v} \\\\times\\\\big(\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{CP}\\\\big)\\|}$$ Vector $\\\\vec{u}$ is parallel to line $l\\_C$ because $l\\_C$ is orthogonal to both vectors $\\\\vec{v}$ and $\\\\vec{n}$, and vector $\\\\vec{u}$ is also orthogonal to both of them (cross product of the two).\n4. If point $O$ is the origin of the coordinate system, a point $X$ lies on the line $l\\_C$ if and only if\n$$\\\\vec{OX}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\+ t \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n5. The two intersection points $Q\\_1$ and $Q\\_2$ you are looking for are \n$$\\\\vec{OQ\\_1}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\+ r \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n$$\\\\vec{OQ\\_2}\\= \\\\vec{OC} \\- r \\\\, \\\\vec{u}$$\n\nIf I am not wrong, according to the way I have deliberately defined the relative location of the vectors, point $Q\\_1$ should be \"behind\" the line $l$ and point $Q\\_2$ \"in front\" when looking from point $P$. For further reference I will use the notations $R\\_1 \\= PQ\\_1 \\\\cap l$ and $R\\_2 \\= PQ\\_2 \\\\cap l$.\n\n6. For $i\\=1,2$ calculate the vectors $$\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\= \\\\vec{CP} \\- (\\-1\\)^{i} \\\\, r \\\\, \\\\vec{u} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\text{ and } \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\|Q\\_iP\\| \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\big(\\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{Q\\_iP} \\\\big)}$$ i.e. the latter is a dot product and then square root.

Thing is, there are tools [1](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/file-compare-two-pdf-files.html), [2](https://superuser.com/q/46123/97481) capable to produce PDF diffs.\n\n* For the sake of completeness it is worth noting that PDF also [can be saved as plain text](http://www.adobe.com/designcenter-archive/tutorials/acr7at_savepdfas/), which in theory would make things essentially the same as working with routine code diffs, but since all my attempts to use it led to meaningless garbage, I won't go further here.\n\nIn my experience, working with PDF diffs was pretty much close to regular code diffs, in the sense that one can refer, describe and discuss these in a meaningful way. *\"In 7th diff at page 654, word `foo` should be replaced with `bar`\"*.

Does anticipated usage of doc diff involve scenarios where code review tools offer substantial benefit over PDF diffs?\n\nSay, having 2\\-3 \"rounds\" review of 1000 diffs in 100 files in a day is perfectly sensible with a decent code review tool, but I can not even imagine this to be done with PDF diffs, as there is unlikely a demand in a tool capable of that, given typical PDF usage."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of writing and maintaining software design specifications, which of the following statements best reflects the importance and practicality of document merging and comparison?\n\nA) Document merging is unnecessary, and Word's built-in merge tool is sufficient for any rare merging needs.\n\nB) The ability to easily compare and merge documents is crucial, and tools like git merge must work seamlessly with the chosen documentation format.\n\nC) PDF diffs provide an adequate middle ground for document comparison, but may not be suitable for complex merging scenarios or high-volume reviews.\n\nD) Merging capabilities are irrelevant as long as the documents can be exported to PDF format.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it balances the importance of document comparison with the practical limitations of different tools and formats.

This phenomenon is an example of a periodic cycle in Newton's method. In some cases, especially for polynomials of higher degree, Newton's method can get trapped in a cycle between points that are not actually roots of the equation.

The distance between each mass is $\\\\Delta x$ which we use to express the total length as $l\\=(n\\+1\\)\\\\Delta x$. The displacement from the equilibrium position is given by $\\\\phi(x,t)$. \n\nThe discrete Lagrangian in terms of the $i$th particle $\\\\mathscr L$ is composed as follows, \n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\mathscr L\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum \\_{i\\=1}^{n}m\\\\dot \\\\phi \\_i^2\\-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum ^n \\_{i\\=0}k(\\\\phi\\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)^2\n\\\\end{equation} \n\nAt this point we take the continuum limit such that the number of masses in the fixed length of rod tends to infinity and correspondingly the inter\\-particle distance tends to zero. It is fruitful to multiply top and bottom by $\\\\Delta x$ such that we can define two quantities that remain constant during this limit namely the linear density ($\\\\mu\\=m/\\\\Delta x$) and the elastic modulus ($\\\\kappa\\=k\\\\Delta x$).\n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\mathscr L\\=\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\sum \\_{i\\=1}^{n}\\\\Delta x\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\bigg)\\\\dot {\\\\phi} \\_i^2\\-\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\sum \\_{i\\=0}^{n}\\\\Delta x(k\\\\Delta x)\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\bigg)^2\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nIt is easy to see why the linear density remains constant since both the number of masses per unit length increases while simultaneously the unit length decreases. \n\nHowever my question is regarding the elastic modulus, I fail to see how it remains constant in this limit.\n\nThe argument goes as follows; \nSince the extension of the rod per unit length is directly proportional to the force exerted on the rod the elastic modulus being the constant of proportionality. The force between two discreet particles is $F\\_i\\=k(\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)$, the extension of the inter particle spacing per unit length is $(\\\\phi \\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi \\_i)/\\\\Delta x$. Therefore (HOW) $\\\\kappa\\=k\\\\Delta x$ is constant. Its easy to relate them but why is it constant!?! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Honestly, I think this is one of those cases where you should just accept it and push on. This 'derivation' is really nothing more than a pedagogical device to make field theory seem somewhat natural to students with a background in classical mechanics. \n\nWhat we are trying to do is to take the continuum i.e. $N\\\\to \\\\infty$ limit of the following Lagrangian: \n\n$$L\\_N\\=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Biggl(\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^N\\\\Delta x \\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\dot{\\\\phi\\_i}^2\\-\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{N\\-1}\\\\Delta x\\\\ k\\\\Delta x \\\\biggl\\[\\\\frac{\\\\phi\\_{i\\+1}\\-\\\\phi\\_i}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\biggr]^2\\\\Biggr) $$\n\ndefine $\\\\mu\\=\\\\frac{m}{\\\\Delta x}$ and $Y\\=k\\\\Delta x$\n\nClearly, for a continuum limit, we get infinitely many particles, so the total kinetic energy of the system *should* diverge... unless we impose (or put in by hand, as they call it), that $\\\\mu$ remains constant, not $m$. Similarly, it is obvious that the equilibrium force of each spring $F\\=k \\\\Delta x$ *should* vanish... unless we impose that $k\\\\Delta x$ is constant when we take our limit. With these ad\\-hoc assumptions, and replacing the discrete index $i$ with a continuous spatial coordinate, we get \n\n$$L\\\\equiv \\\\lim\\_{N\\\\to \\\\infty}L\\_N\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\biggl(\\\\mu\\\\dot \\\\phi^2 \\-Y(\\\\nabla\\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr)$$\nThis gives us the right action for a free, massless, scalar field\n\\\\begin{align\\*}S\\[\\\\phi]\\&\\=\\-\\\\frac{Y}{2}\\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\biggl(\\-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{Y}\\\\dot \\\\phi^2\\+(\\\\nabla \\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\-\\\\frac{\\\\mu c^2}{2} \\\\int\\_0^l \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\biggl(\\-\\\\frac{1}{c^2}(\\\\partial\\_t\\\\phi)^2\\+(\\\\nabla\\\\phi)^2\\\\biggr) \\\\hspace{2cm}c\\=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{Y}{\\\\mu}}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=\\-\\\\mu c^2\\\\int\\_0^l\\\\mathrm{d}^2x\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\eta^{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\phi\\\\partial\\_\\\\nu\\\\phi\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nThe definition of $c$ is the standard one for the speed of longitudinal waves, and as one can see this Lagrangian is also reminiscent of the action for a relativistic point particle (especially the prefactor).

As explained in the documentation, these quantities are chosen to remain constant as ad-hoc assumptions to avoid divergences in the continuum limit.

Similarly, assuming \u03ba=k\u0394x remains constant prevents the spring forces from vanishing in the limit. These assumptions are made to ensure a meaningful and finite continuum limit that produces the expected field theory for a continuous elastic rod. The documentation explicitly states that these are \"ad-hoc assumptions\" made to achieve the desired result, not natural consequences of the limit process or derived properties."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/07", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/50247", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/14952/"], "docs_id": 50247, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to know the architecture of QGIS: relationships between QGIS and other open sources, and what elements are implemented in the QGIS. \n\nUsually, There is a diagram showing the architecture of a software such as arcobjects.

GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is used for raster data, while OGR (Simple Features Library) is used for vector data. This library is crucial for QGIS's ability to read and write various geospatial data formats, making it an integral part of the QGIS architecture without being part of the core itself.

However some geometries have a lot of vertices which results in WKT strings longer than the VARCHAR limit. That is why I'm trying to use WKB blobs instead.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Looking at the implementation of the WKT/WKB to SDO\\_GEOMETRY, I see that this specific exception (`java.sql.SQLException: Malformed WKT`) only exists in older releases of Oracle (12\\.1 and earlier). Since 12\\.2 it is replaced with an exception message that returns mode details about what the nature of the error is. But the key fact is: this message comes only in the code path that processes **WKT**. It does **not** occur in the path that processes **WKB**.\n\nSo, my suspicion is that the code you execute ...\n\n```\naoi = 'some_shapefile.shp'\nsql = \"\"\" SELECT* \n          FROM table b \n          WHERE SDO_RELATE (b.SHAPE, SDO_GEOMETRY(:wkb, :srid),'mask=ANYINTERACT') = 'TRUE' \"\"\" \n\nconnection = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, hostname, encoding=\"UTF-8\")\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\ngdf = gpd.read_file(aoi)\nsrid = gdf.crs.to_epsg()\nwkb = gdf['geometry'].to_wkb().iloc[0] \n\nbvars = {'wkb': wkb, 'srid': srid} \ncursor.execute(sql,bvars)\n\n```\n\n... somehow passes the `wkb` variable as a string, which then appears as a WKT input to the SDO\\_GEOMETRY constructor.\n\nCan you try the following alternate syntax that explicitly calls the WKB parser ?\n\n```\nSELECT * \nFROM table b \nWHERE SDO_RELATE (b.SHAPE, set_srid(SDO_UTIL.FROM_WKBGEOMETRY(:wkb),:srid),'mask=ANYINTERACT') = 'TRUE'\n\n```\n\nNote that the `SDO_UTIL.FROM_WKBGEOMETRY()` function does not let you pass an explicit SRID. So, before doing the above, you need to define a simple function `SET_SRID()` that sets the SRID of a geometry:\n\n```\ncreate or replace function set_srid (g sdo_geometry, srid number) return sdo_geometry\nis\n  gs sdo_geometry;\nbegin\n  gs := g;\n  gs.sdo_srid := srid;\n  return gs;\nend;\n/\n\n```\n\nand use that in the SELECT statement as shown.\n\nThen your query should work (it works for me with this change)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using Geopandas to pass WKB (Well-Known Binary) geometries into an Oracle SQL query, an error occurs indicating a \"Malformed WKT\". What is the most likely cause of this issue and how can it be resolved?\n\nA) The WKB data is corrupted. Regenerate the WKB from the original shapefile.\n\nB) Oracle doesn't support WKB input. Use WKT (Well-Known Text) instead.\n\nC) The WKB is being passed as a string and misinterpreted as WKT. Use SDO_UTIL.FROM_WKBGEOMETRY() to explicitly parse WKB.\n\nD) The SRID (Spatial Reference ID) is incorrect. Update the SRID in the original shapefile.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The error message suggests that Oracle is attempting to process WKT (Well-Known Text) instead of WKB, even though WKB was intended. This indicates that the WKB data is likely being passed as a string and misinterpreted as WKT by Oracle. \n\nTo resolve this, the query should be modified to explicitly use the SDO_UTIL.FROM_WKBGEOMETRY() function to parse the WKB data correctly. Additionally, since this function doesn't allow specifying an SRID directly, a custom SET_SRID() function should be created to set the SRID after parsing the WKB.\n\nThe corrected query would look like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM table b \nWHERE SDO_RELATE (b.SHAPE, set_srid(SDO_UTIL.FROM_WKBGEOMETRY(:wkb),:srid),'mask=ANYINTERACT') = 'TRUE'\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the WKB data is correctly interpreted and the SRID is properly set, resolving the \"Malformed WKT\" error."}}
