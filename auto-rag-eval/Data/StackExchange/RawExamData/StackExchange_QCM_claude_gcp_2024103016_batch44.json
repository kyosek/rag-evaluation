(Even within the concurrent collections, there isn't an immediate equivalent \\- and you should only use the concurrent collections when you actually anticipate concurrent access anyway.)\n\nThere are `Stack<T>` and `Queue<T>`, as well as `LinkedList<T>` \\- but all of those are somewhat different to `ArrayList` in terms of what you can do with them. They're worth considering if you don't need random access, of course.\n\nI wouldn't expect too much more in terms of *efficiency* unless you're currently boxing a lot of large value types in your `ArrayList`. What you *can* expect is far clearer code. Fewer casts, less uncertainty about the contents of the collection, etc.\n\nIf you have the option of upgrading to .NET 3\\.5 at any point in the near future, that would then give you access to LINQ, which is *fabulously* useful when dealing with collections.

This aligns with option C, which states that the choice is based on the speaker's perspective and presentation of information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simple tenses don't always indicate completed actions, as shown in the example \"When I walked to the shop yesterday, I saw Jenny,\" where the action could be either completed or incomplete.\n\nOption B is partially true but not always accurate.

More generally, can one describe the set of such $\\\\alpha$ (empty/non\\-empty, finite/infinite etc.) if one is given $f$?\n\nExamples:\n\n* $f(x)\\=\\-x$: These are precisely the square roots of algebraic numbers $\\\\beta$ such that there is no square root of $\\\\beta$ in $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\beta)$. There are infinitely many $\\\\alpha$ and even infinitely many of degree $2$.\n* $f(x)\\=x^2$: These are precisely the roots of unity of odd order, since $H(\\\\alpha)\\=H(\\\\alpha^2\\)\\=H(\\\\alpha)^2$ implies $H(\\\\alpha)\\=1$, so $\\\\alpha$ a root of unity. Here $H(\\\\alpha)$ is the absolute multiplicative Weil height of $\\\\alpha$. There are infinitely many $\\\\alpha$, but only finitely many of degree $\\\\leq D$ for any $D$.\n* $f(x)\\=x\\+1$: There is no $\\\\alpha$. If there was and $P(x)$ was its minimal polynomial, then $P(x\\+1\\)$ would be another irreducible polynomial, vanishing at $\\\\alpha$, with the same leading coefficient and hence $P(x\\+1\\)\\=P(x)$. Looking at the coefficients of the second highest power of $x$ now leads to a contradiction. Analogously for $f(x)\\=x\\+a$ if $a$ is any non\\-zero rational number.\n\nSo the existence of such an $\\\\alpha$ and the set of all possible $\\\\alpha$ seem to depend rather intricately on $f(x)$, which seems interesting to me. As I found no discussion of this question in the literature, I post it here.\n\nUPDATE: Firstly thanks to all who have contributed so far! As Eric Wofsey pointed out, any solution $\\\\alpha$ will satisfy $f^n(\\\\alpha)\\=\\\\alpha$ for some $n\\>1$, where $f^n$ is the $n$\\-th iterate of $f$. So one should consider solutions of the equation $f^n(x)\\-x\\=0$ or $f^p(x)\\-x\\=0$ for $p$ prime.\n\nIf the degree of $f$ is at least 2, one can always find irrational such solutions $\\\\alpha$ with $f(\\\\alpha) \\\\neq \\\\alpha$ by the answer of Joe Silverman. However, for his proof to work, we'd need to know that $f^k(\\\\alpha)$ and $\\\\alpha$ are conjugate for some $k$ with $0 \\< k \\<p$. I'm not enough of an expert to follow through with his hints for proving this, but if someone does, I'd be very happy about an answer!\n\nIf the degree of $f$ is 1, then $f$ is a M\u00f6bius transformation and all $f^n$ will have the same fixed points as $f$ (so there's no solution) unless $f$ is of finite order. In that case, if $f(x) \\\\neq x$, the order is 2, 3, 4 or 6 (see [http://home.wlu.edu/\\~dresdeng/papers/nine.pdf](http://home.wlu.edu/~dresdeng/papers/nine.pdf)). By the same reference, in the latter three cases, $f$ is conjugate to $\\\\frac{\\-1}{x\\+1}$, $\\\\frac{x\\-1}{x\\+1}$ or $\\\\frac{2x\\-1}{x\\+1}$, so it suffices to consider these $f$, which give rise to the minimal polynomials $x^3\\-nx^2\\-(n\\+3\\)x\\-1$ (closely related to the polynomial in GNiklasch's answer), $x^4\\+nx^3\\-6x^2\\-nx\\+1$ and $x^6\\-2nx^5\\+5(n\\-3\\)x^4\\+20x^3\\-5nx^2\\+2(n\\-3\\)x\\+1$, if my calculations are correct. If the order is 2, the map is of the form $\\\\frac{\\-x\\+a}{bx\\+1}$ or $\\\\frac{a}{x}$, which leads to $x^2\\+(bn\\-a)x\\+n$ or $x^2\\+nx\\+a$ respectively. So this case is somewhat degenerate, which explains the unusual behavior of $f(x)\\=\\-x$ and $f(x)\\=x\\+1$ above.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A first observation is that the field $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\alpha)$ must admit a non\\-identity automorphism $\\\\sigma$, since applying a rational function to $\\\\alpha$ will not take us outside this field. Given such $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\sigma$, you can immediately read off an $f$ by expressing $\\\\sigma(\\\\alpha)$ as a $\\\\mathbb{Q}$\\-linear combination of $1, \\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2,\\\\ldots$, and there'll be additional non\\-polynomial (rational) expressions in terms of $\\\\alpha$. This leads to plenty of examples, but now we want to turn this around and start from a given $f$.\n\nNext, the application of $f$ can be iterated. If $g$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha$ over the rationals, $g \\\\circ f$ will be a rational function whose numerator vanishes at $\\\\alpha$, hence is divisible in $\\\\mathbb{Q}\\[x]$ by $g$, hence vanishes at $f(\\\\alpha)$ as well, so $g(f(f(\\\\alpha))) \\= (g\\\\circ f)(f(\\\\alpha))\\=0$, so $f(f(\\\\alpha))$ is another conjugate of $\\\\alpha$, and so forth.\n\nSince there are only finitely many conjugates to choose from, some iterate $f^{\\\\circ n}(\\\\alpha)$ must return to $\\\\alpha$: in other words, $\\\\alpha$ will be a root of (the numerator of) $f^{\\\\circ n}(x)\\-x$ for some integer $n \\> 1$. (This leads to another argument ruling out $f(x)\\=x\\+1$ and friends, as has been noted in the comments.)\n\nSo in many cases you'll be able, given $f$, to find the $\\\\alpha$ by picking an $n$ and factoring the numerator of $f^{\\\\circ n}(x)\\-x$ into irreducible polynomials.\n\nHowever, the $n$\\-th iterate of $f$ might be the identity function $x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ *already*, and the numerator to be factored might thus be zero! This happens in your first example $f(x)\\=\\-x$ with $n\\=2$, or with $$f(x)\\=1/x$$ again with $n\\=2$ which leads to reciprocal minimal polynomials $g(x)\\=x^{\\\\mathrm{deg}(g)}g(1/x)$, or with (e.g.) $$f(x)\\=1\\-1/x$$ with $n\\=3$ which gives rise (among other things) to what D. Shanks in 1974 called *The Simplest Cubic Fields* ([Math.Comp. **28**, 1137\\-1152](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1974-28-128/S0025-5718-1974-0352049-8/S0025-5718-1974-0352049-8.pdf)), with $g(x)\\=x^3\\+ax^2\\-(a\\+3\\)x\\+1$. Here, you can proceed by prescribing a degree for $g$, spelling out the condition that $g$ should divide the numerator of $g\\\\circ f$, and comparing coefficients."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a non-constant rational function f(x) in \u211a(x).

So, **how could my question be reworded to fit in this site?** If its not possible, why?\n\n I've [already](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6742/on-discussions-and-why-they-dont-make-good-questions) [read](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7182/what-goes-on-programmers-se-a-guide-for-stack-overflow) [some](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) [meta](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6473/the-real-borderline-for-opinion-based-in-programmers) [questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/) before posting this meta question. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would suggest narrowing the scope, ideally to focus on a concrete *problem* that you would like to solve.\n\nThis question was as much \"too broad\" as it was \"opinion\\-based\", because there's a potentially endless list of believable reasons people could post. You've listed three good ones just in this meta post, a few of the commenters and myself have a fourth one in mind (namely, Javascript is the only option on the client, and being able to use the same language on the server is nice), and I'm sure there are plenty more. This is great on other sites that encourage subjective polls/discussions, but here it's a problem because there's no way to know whether one of these answers is better than another. They're all equally plausible, and this sort of thing never has hard statistics to go look up, so whose answer do I upvote? Whose do you accept?\n\nAnd that's why the best questions are the ones that start out with a clear problem statement. While we don't do tool recommendations (those are fraught with similar issues), there are plenty of questions you could ask about, such as whether the single event loop model of asynchronous programming is a good idea for a CPU\\-bound web service. For focused, goal\\-oriented questions like that (assuming you provided more details of course), we can clearly tell if one answer is more helpful than another, and everything just works.\n\n(Note that this is not intended to be an accurate description of *all* the good, on\\-topic questions we have here, just the subset that I believe comes closest to what you asked today.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is the primary recommendation for improving a broad, opinion-based question on Software Engineering Stack Exchange?\n\nA) Focus on subjective polls and discussions to gather more diverse opinions\nB) Narrow the scope to address a concrete problem that needs solving\nC) Expand the question to cover more potential reasons and explanations\nD) Seek hard statistics to support various plausible answers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests narrowing the scope of the question, ideally to focus on a concrete problem that needs solving.

If you're looking for (let's say) the power consumption, which will be in amps, or the gain bandwidth product, which will be in Hz, it's far easier to run your eye quickly down the righthand 'units' column, looking for the relevant unit, than reading down the left hand measurement description column.\n\nThis energy dissipation will be measured in Joules, and it's about the only specification in those units. It's called either the 'Unclamped Inductive Switching Energy' (UIS) or the Collector\\-Emitter Avalanche Energy.\n\nAs the inductor current is interrupted, the voltage will rise. The IGBT structure is fairly robust, and avalanches stably at the breakdown voltage, as long as the energy dumped (assumed adiabatically (that is instantaneously, without any heat loss to the surroundings)) into the junction is limited to limit the temperature rise.\n\n[This example IGBT](http://m.littelfuse.com/~/media/electronics/datasheets/power_semiconductors/littelfuse_power_semiconductor_ignition_igbt_devices_ngd8201b_datasheet.pdf.pdf) is a fairly small one, 20A 400V, designed for car ignition. It has a single pulse CE avalanche energy of around 400mJ. You might expect the spec to more or less scale with IGBT current, so it looks like you're looking for a \\>\\>1000A part before you start seeing 10s of Joules specified. This might be reasonable if you have a 300A load.\n\nIf you want to switch the current off quickly, then you need to allow the voltage to rise, and the higher the better. There are alternatives to dumping the energy in the IGBT junction. \n\nThe simplest is to put a resistor plus diode in parallel with the inductor. Arrange the resistor value R2 to develop a bit less than the IGBT's breakdown voltage at the inductor current, so that it limits the voltage across the IGBT. The current will not stop as quickly as for using a constant voltage breakdown mechanism, but heat in a big resistor is a lot easier to handle than heat in a small semiconductor junction.\n\nA faster way (more time\\-averaged voltage provided) is to charge a capacitor C3\\. If it's big enough, the voltage will be fairly constant during the pulse, and it can be steadily discharged by a low power route, R3\\.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Kxrf.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f6Kxrf.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit to quickly switch off a 300A current through an inductive load of 500\u03bcH. They plan to use an IGBT for this purpose. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the energy dissipation and the best approach to protect the IGBT?\n\nA) The energy to be dissipated is 22.5J, and the IGBT's Unclamped Inductive Switching Energy (UIS) rating directly determines if it can handle this without damage.\n\nB) The energy to be dissipated is 22.5J, but using a parallel resistor-diode network is a safer approach than relying solely on the IGBT's breakdown characteristics.\n\nC) The energy to be dissipated is less than 22.5J due to the IGBT's fast switching time, and a capacitor in parallel with the load is the only effective protection method.\n\nD) The energy dissipation is negligible because the IGBT's collector-emitter voltage will not rise significantly during turn-off.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The energy stored in the inductor is indeed 22.5J (1/2 * L * I^2 = 0.5 * 500\u03bcH * 300A^2 = 22.5J). While the IGBT's UIS rating is relevant, it's typically much lower than this energy for most IGBTs. The documentation suggests that even 1000A rated IGBTs might struggle with tens of Joules. \n\nThe correct approach, as outlined in the documentation, is to use alternative methods to dissipate this energy safely. A parallel resistor-diode network is suggested as a simple solution that can limit the voltage across the IGBT and dissipate the energy more safely in a larger resistor rather than in the semiconductor junction. This makes option B the most accurate and complete answer.\n\nOption A is partially correct but overlooks the safer alternative methods.

This question, at least in the Riemannian setting, is treated with some care in the paper:\n\nBourguignon, Jean\\-Pierre; Gauduchon, Paul, Spineurs, op\u00e9rateurs de Dirac et variations de m\u00e9triques.

I haven't looked at Bourguignon\\-Gauduchon for a while, but I believe that it provides a way of identifying spin bundles for nearby metrics; this identification then tells you what the topology of the space E should be, and provide local trivializations for the bundle.

The Bourguignon-Gauduchon paper, as described in the given text, provides a way to identify spin bundles for nearby metrics. This identification is crucial for understanding the topology of the space E and for providing local trivializations of the bundle. While the paper goes further to compare Dirac operators for different metrics, its foundation lies in this comparison of spinor bundles for nearby metrics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the relationship, claiming all spin bundles are isomorphic regardless of metric difference.

Suppose at the shown point of the screen wave from point source $1$ interferes destructively with wave from point source $6$ then waves from point sources $2,3,4,7,8,9$ also cancel out pairwise as before. But the wave from point $5$ still remains and does not mutually cancel out with another other light wave (from another point source). So if we consider odd number of point sources the shown point on the screen should not have a dark fringe (or minima).\n\n**To sum up my queries:**\n\n* Why should we take even number of point sources to explain single slit diffraction pattern ?\n* Is there any method to resolve this discrepancy ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is, taking an even or odd number of point sources is an approximation and therefore seems to lead to discrepancies in any case; as the guy says in the video, one should take into consideration an infinite number of point sources, but drawing them would be too long so he chooses to take eight. \n\nThe reasoning comes from Huygens' principle ([what is it?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle \"Huygens-Frenel principle\")): so to be completely correct, one should make all the calculations with an integral (thus including every one of the infinite, infinitesimally small point sources) and would indeed arrive to the same result for the interference pattern, obtained with rigorous means.\n\nSo to answer your question, the need to have an even number of point sources is a consequence of the approximate nature of the reasoning used in the video, and is not an intrinsic inconsistency of the theory (when you have an infinite number of point sources, it doesn't even make sense to wonder if they are even or odd)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In explaining single slit diffraction patterns, a video uses 8 point sources to demonstrate destructive interference.

The most accurate model, based on Huygens' principle, would consider an infinite number of point sources. This approach resolves the apparent discrepancy between even and odd numbers of sources, as the distinction becomes meaningless with infinite sources. The other options are incorrect: A) is false because even numbers aren't mathematically necessary, just convenient for the approximation; B) is incorrect as odd numbers don't always result in constructive interference; and D) is wrong because using an odd number doesn't increase accuracy and doesn't properly represent the continuous nature of the wavefront."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/27", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/166412", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/49428/"], "docs_id": 166412, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We recently start a store which includes grocery, clothing, and jewelry on this when I upload product for grocery and other we facing a problem.

Can we extend $f$ smoothly to $R^N$?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Q1: Definately not always. More like \"almost never\". If the automorphism extends to $\\\\mathbb R^3$, then the bundle $S^1 \\\\ltimes\\_f M$ would embed in $S^4$. $S^1 \\\\ltimes\\_f M$ is the bundle over $S^1$ with fiber $M$ and monodromy $f$. The most\\-commonly used obstructions to embedding in this case are things like the Alexander polynomial, and Milnor signatures.\n\nI don't see where the metric on $M$ plays a role for this.\n\nIf you want to see automorphisms that extend (and do not extend) for your Q1, take a look at my [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2346). You'll also find some references to several Jonathan Hillman papers that explore such obstructions.\n\nIn the case that your surface is unknotted \\-\\- bounding handlebodies on both sides (thinking of $M \\\\subset S^3$) then the automorphisms of $M$ that extend in this case are well\\-known. They're called the mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of $S^3$. It's an infinite group. Generators are known for it (if I recall, they're the automorphisms induced by handle slides) but off the top of my head I'm not sure how much is known about the structure of the group. Do a little Googling on \"mapping class group of a Heegaard splitting of S^3\" and you should start finding relevant material.\n\nTo respond to your 2nd edit, if the co\\-dimension is high enough all automorphisms extend. This is a theorem of Hassler Whitney's. The basic idea is this, let $f : M \\\\to M$ be an automorphism. Let $i : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^k$ be any embedding. So you have two embeddings $i \\\\circ f$ and $i$ of $M$ in $\\\\mathbb R^k$. Any two maps $M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^k$ are isotopic provided the co\\-dimension is large enough $k \\\\geq 2m\\+3$ suffices, for example. So isotope your standard inclusion to the one pre\\-composed with $f$. The Isotopy Extension Theorem gives you the result.\n\nFor example, if $\\\\Sigma$ is a Heegaard splitting / the surface is unknotted, $\\\\Sigma \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^3$ (or $\\\\subset \\\\mathbb S^3$) and you have an automorphism $f : \\\\Sigma \\\\to \\\\Sigma$ a neccessary and sufficient condition for $f$ to extend to $\\\\mathbb R^3$ (or a side\\-preserving automorphism of the pair $(S^3,\\\\Sigma)$ in the $S^3$ case) is that if $C \\\\subset \\\\Sigma$ is a curve that bounds a disc on either the inside or outside of $\\\\Sigma$ respectively, then $f(C)$ bounds a disc on the inside or outside of $\\\\Sigma$ respectively (here I'm using inside/outside re the Jordan\\-Brouwer separation theorem).

When I generate variable frequency pulses by using a micro controller does that mean I am suing the inner clock and the pulses are not accurate enough? Some tutorials play with the registers and obtain any pulse frequency. \n\nMy question is, for example if I use AVR such like in Arduino Uno board and play with the registers does that mean I will use the inner clock? Is there a way to obtain more accurate pulses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"inner\" clock, you mean the internal RC oscillator that comes with the device from the factory. It is inside the chip, and is not very accurate over temperature range, which means it will not actually be the frequency that you assume it is, and indeed it may have a lot of \"jitter\" which means the clock generated from the internal oscillator will not have very \"precise\" timing, one clock pulse might be \\+\\-10\\-\\>15% different to the one before it, and the one after it. This is bad for cycle\\-by\\-cycle timing.\n\nThe use of external crystals allows you to have faster clock speeds than that possible with the internal source available in your given example (Atmel ATMEGA328P which is on the Arduino Uno), and these provide (usually! Quality and material are relevant here) very good *accuracy* and cycle\\-by\\-cycle *precision* of the clock signal.\n\nThe system clock is generated from these different possible sources, so if you use a bad accuracy/quality source and expect high speed and timing, you will have problems. Use a good crystal, and you can very nicely time things, such as a very precise/accurate digital signal at a set frequency (given the limitations of timers mentioned below). \n\nThe registers that you mention are the perhaps those which allow you to change the CLKDIV options, which allows you to divide an input clock source frequency and make the system clock slower which uses less power, and may give better timing characteristics. The output of the system clock signal may sometimes be selected for one of the microcontroller pins, to clock external devices with a nice clean digital clock \\- for example, a Camera IC, or a reference clock input for synchronous devices. \n\nThe timers inside the microcontrollers use the main clock source, and often have dividers you can set for them separately. From the resulting timer speed, you can then set \"output compare\" registers, which allows you to choose (based on the resolution!) a certain point where the timer will reset \\- you may have this essentially act as a digital pulse generator, of reasonably good control of the frequency up to a certain point. 8 Bit timers will allow you to choose an output in steps of 1\\-255, and 16 bit timers allow you to set a step size of 1\\-\\>65536\\. Using a 16 bit timer and a very good quality clock source input would yield the \"best\" output.\n\nThe Atmega328P on the Arduino Uno has multiple timers, so you could make the output compare channels produce more than one custom/adjustable frequency pulse signal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a system that requires precise timing for multiple output signals.

Using an external crystal oscillator provides better accuracy and precision compared to the internal RC oscillator, which can have up to 10-15% variation. The 16-bit timers offer higher resolution (1-65536) compared to 8-bit timers (1-255), allowing for more precise frequency control. The output compare registers allow for generating custom frequency outputs. The ATmega328P has multiple timers, so two separate frequencies can be generated simultaneously.

You have just circumnavigated the programming language / type system globe, arriving on the other side of the world from whence you departed. You have just landed on the border of dynamic language / prototype\\-based object land!\n\nMany dynamic languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP, Python) allow one to extend or change object properties at runtime. \n\nThe extreme form of this is a [prototype based language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) like [Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)) or JavaScript. They\ndo not have classes, strictly speaking. You can do things that look like class\\-based, object\\-oriented programming with inheritance, but the rules are greatly relaxed compared to more sharply\\-defined, class\\-based languages like Java and C\\#.\n\nLangauges like PHP and Python live in the middle ground. They have regular, idiomatic class\\-based systems. But object attributes can be added, changed, or deleted at runtime\\-\\-albeit with some restrictions (like \"except for built\\-in types\") that you don't find in JavaScript.\n\nThe big tradeoff for this dynamism is performance. Forget how strongly or weakly typed the language is, or how well it can be compiled down to machine code. Dynamic objects must be represented as flexible maps/dictionaries, rather than simple structs. This adds overhead to every object access. Some programs go to great lengths to reduce this overhead (e.g. with phantom kwarg assignment and slot\\-based classes in Python), but the extra overhead is usually just par for the course and the price of admission.\n\nGetting back to your design, you're grafting the ability to have dynamic properties onto a subset of your classes. A `Product` can have variable attributes; presumably an `Invoice` or an `Order` would and could not. It's not a bad way to go. It gives you the flexibility to have variation where you need it, while remaining in a strict, disciplined language and type system. On the down side, you are responsible for managing those flexible properties, and you'll probably have to do so through mechanisms that look slightly different from more native attributes. `p.prop('tensile_strength')` rather than `p.tensile_strength`, for instance, and `p.set_prop('tensile_strength', 104.4)` rather than `p.tensile_strength = 104.4`. But I've worked with and built many programs in Pascal, Ada, C, Java and even dynamic languages that used exactly such getter\\-setter access for non\\-standard attribute types; the approach is clearly workable.\n\nBy the by, this tension between static types and a highly varied world is extremely common. An analogous problem is often seen when designing database schema, especially for relational and pre\\-relational data stores. Sometimes it's dealt with by creating \"super\\-rows\" that contain enough flexibility to contain or define the union of all imagined variations, then stuffing any data that comes along into those fields. The [WordPress `wp_posts` table](http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description), for example, has fields like `comment_count`, `ping_status`, `post_parent` and `post_date_gmt` that are only interesting under some circumstances, and that in practice often go blank. Another approach is a very spare, [normalized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) table like `wp_options`, much like your `Property` class. While it requires more explicit management, items in it are rarely blank. Object\\-oriented and document databases (e.g. MongoDB) often have an easier time dealing with changing options, because they can create and set attributes pretty much at will."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an object-oriented programming paradigm, which approach best balances flexibility and performance when dealing with objects that require variable attributes, while maintaining a structured type system?\n\nA) Using a fully dynamic language like JavaScript, where all objects can have properties added or modified at runtime.\n\nB) Implementing a Property class to store flexible attributes for specific object types, while keeping other classes strictly defined.\n\nC) Creating \"super-classes\" with fields to accommodate all possible variations, leaving unused fields blank when not needed.\n\nD) Exclusively using getter and setter methods for all object properties, regardless of whether they are standard or variable.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B provides the best balance of flexibility and performance in a structured type system. It allows for dynamic properties where needed (like for a Product class) while maintaining strict definitions for other classes. This approach avoids the performance overhead of fully dynamic languages (A) and the potential inefficiencies of super-classes with many unused fields (C). While getter and setter methods (D) can be useful, applying them universally isn't necessary and may add unnecessary complexity.\n\nOption A introduces too much dynamism and potential performance issues. Option C can lead to inefficient data structures and doesn't truly solve the problem of variable attributes. Option D is a technique that can be used in conjunction with other approaches but doesn't directly address the core issue of handling variable attributes in a type-safe manner."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/21", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246168", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/78650/"], "docs_id": 246168, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to make a tree view with TikZ of the different hazards modes that exist with lithium\\-ion batteries.

Obviously no taking the element out of there, or inserting a new one somewhere in\\-between.\n\nAre my senses off or is there a good explanation about *why* you should or shouldn't be allowed to iterate through stack/queue contents in a read\\-only manner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Stack\" and \"queue\" are terms which are sometimes used to mean two different things, *logical* and *physical*.\n\nIn a strict sense, they are *logical* concepts, and by definition, they are only accessed a certain way, either by reading head or the tail of a FIFO or LIFO stream.\n\nIn a practical sense, they are *physical* data structures. For example, in c\\#, there are `Stack<T>` and `Queue<T>` classes available (along with concurrent\\-friendly versions of the same). For practical purposes, these classes have enumerators that allow to see all of the contents, as well as indexer properties that allow random access to any element in any order.\n\nThere are some contexts where this should not be done. For example, let's say you have invented a new language that is optimized for reading databases. A resultset might be exposed as a read\\-once queue that iterates over a database\\-side cursor. In this case, random access of the items in the queue would be a serious problem, because you can't move your database\\-side cursor backwards.\n\nAnother example\\-\\- the CPU's call stack. It is a LIFO structure that you literally cannot access randomly because each item in the stack is a different size, and there is no way to figure out what size it is without reverse engineering each subroutine. Code is able to use this stack effectively only because each subroutine knows how to deallocate its own stack frame.\n\nSo at a *logical* level, you are right\\-\\- queues and stacks are read in a certain way, by definition. On a physical level, sometimes it is fine to use random access, but sometimes it is not fine, and sometimes it is not possible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the logical and physical aspects of stacks and queues?\n\nA) Logical stacks and queues always allow random access to elements, while physical implementations strictly enforce LIFO or FIFO access.\n\nB) Logical stacks and queues are defined by their LIFO or FIFO access patterns, but physical implementations may sometimes allow additional access methods like iteration or random access.\n\nC) Both logical and physical stacks and queues always enforce strict LIFO or FIFO access without any exceptions.\n\nD) Physical implementations of stacks and queues are always more restrictive in their access patterns than their logical definitions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the distinction between logical and physical aspects of stacks and queues as described in the documentation. Logically, stacks and queues are defined by their LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) or FIFO (First-In-First-Out) access patterns. However, in practical implementations (physical aspect), additional access methods like iteration or random access may be provided for convenience or specific use cases, as seen in examples like C#'s Stack<T> and Queue<T> classes. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the typical relationship between logical and physical implementations.

Your transistor isn't actually 2N2222,\n2. Your circuit is not wired as you think,\n3. Your voltage isn't 22 V,\n4. You have something (unsuitable) connected at output,\n5. Faulty test equipment is leading you completely astray.\n\nObviously the easiest things to check are the wiring, the resistor values, and the voltage. Comments have made the suggestion that you have a counterfeit part \\-\\- certainly a possibility. Also of course if the test equipment is faulty, Vout could be something else. If you're getting surprising results: *always check the test equipment.* In this particular case, given that the transistor is burning up, it's pretty evident something is very wrong.\n\nThe first thing to check is the pinout, both from datasheet for the exact part number, and by confirming on the actual device.\n\nVariant Pinout\n--------------\n\nAnother possibility is that your transistor has a different pinout than you're expecting, such as the P\\-variant:\n\n[![Image of different transistor pinouts](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoX2r.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoX2r.png)  \n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222)\n\nWhich would mean you actually have the following, which has VEB of 22 V, where the limit is 6 V (see datasheet portion below).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zysn.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f5zysn.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIdentifying Pins\n----------------\n\nThe classic method for identifying the pins of an out\\-of\\-circuit NPN transistor is to measure the voltage drop with the diode\\-mode of a multimeter. You expect approximately 0\\.6 V measuring from B to C and from B to E, and OL in all the other pairings. The one with the slightly larger drop is the emitter. The 2N3904 I just measured gave 0\\.664 V and 0\\.684 V. (Sorry, no 2N2222 to hand.)\n\nI recommend you try this on your parts which are burning up and see if you can confirm the pinout.\n\nDatasheet Fragment\n------------------\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5i74i.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5i74i.png)\nFrom [datasheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331223626if_/https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/CD00003223%2epdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student is testing a circuit with a transistor labeled as 2N2222A.

The documentation mentions the possibility of a different pinout for P-variant transistors. If the student assumed the standard pinout but actually had a P-variant, it would result in the emitter-base junction being subjected to the full supply voltage, which exceeds its maximum rating of 6V as shown in the datasheet fragment. This would cause immediate damage to the transistor. \n\nOption A is less likely because even counterfeit parts usually have some voltage tolerance.

If you're on iOS 11 you have a lot more options available to you and can even select what functions you want available from the Control Centre.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of how I currently have my Control Centre configured:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ihMcx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ihMcx.png)\n\nAs you can see, by accessing the Control Centre you can instantly tap on the Wi\\-Fi toggle to switch it on/off. The Control Centre also give you fast access to Bluetooth, Airplane Mode, etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An iPhone user living in a rural area with limited internet connectivity wants to efficiently manage their Wi-Fi connection when leaving and returning home. Which of the following methods provides the quickest and most convenient way to toggle Wi-Fi on and off on an iPhone X?\n\nA) Creating a custom shortcut icon on the home screen\nB) Navigating through the Settings app each time\nC) Swiping down from the top right of the screen to access Control Centre\nD) Installing a third-party app for Wi-Fi management\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. For an iPhone X, swiping down from the top right of the screen provides quick access to the Control Centre. This feature allows users to instantly toggle Wi-Fi on and off with a single tap, without needing to navigate through multiple menus in the Settings app or install additional software. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while creating a custom shortcut icon might be possible, it's not as efficient as using the built-in Control Centre. \n\nOption B is incorrect as it involves multiple steps and is time-consuming compared to using the Control Centre. \n\nOption D is unnecessary since iOS provides a native solution through the Control Centre, making third-party apps redundant for this specific task.\n\nThe Control Centre can be customized in Settings > Control Centre to include various toggles and shortcuts, making it an ideal solution for quickly managing device functions like Wi-Fi."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/22", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/232848", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 232848, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Do you have to pay for the gamemodes in Garry's Mod or are they free?

All game modes in Garry's Mod are indeed free to access. However, some servers or custom game modes may utilize assets from other Source engine games like Counter-Strike: Source or Half-Life 2: Episode 2. If a player doesn't own or have these games installed, they may experience missing textures (replaced by pink checkerboards) or missing models (displayed as red ERROR text). This means that while the game modes themselves are free, full functionality and visual experience might require owning additional games.\n\nOption B is incorrect because not all assets are self-contained within Garry's Mod; some rely on other Source games.\nOption C is false as the game modes themselves don't require separate purchases.\nOption D is incorrect because custom game modes are also free, though they may use assets from other games."}}
