I see nothing in the logs and the program continues to run as usual until I hit Ctrl\\-C in the terminal I launched it from.\n\nAre there any differences between how Ctrl\\-C sends the signal and how kill does?\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe program in question is a Java application launched by a bash shell script which sets up some environment variables (namely `CLASSPATH`) and then calls `java [main class]`. Hitting Ctrl\\-Z and then running `ps` results in the following:\n\n```\n$ ps -f\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\nmdeck    10251 10250  0 11:48 pts/2    00:00:00 -bash\nmdeck    13405 10251  0 18:12 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/myapp.sh\nmdeck    13509 13405 25 18:12 pts/2    00:00:03 java com.company.MyApp\nmdeck    13526 10251  0 18:13 pts/2    00:00:00 ps -f\n\n```\n\nThe output of stty as requested by Gilles is below:\n\n```\n$ stty -a </dev/pts/2\nspeed 38400 baud; rows 40; columns 203; line = 0;\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; eol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;\n-parenb -parodd cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts\n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl ixon -ixoff -iuclc -ixany -imaxbel -iutf8\nopost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0 ff0\nisig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt echoctl echoke\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One possibility is that the program catches the `Ctrl`\\+`C` sequence. Check the output of `stty -a`; the `intr` setting indicates which key combination (if any) sends a SIGINT signal, and the `isig` indicates whether the signal keys are enabled (`-isig` means they are disabled).\n\nIf the program consists of several processes, pressing `Ctrl`\\+`C` sends SIGINT to all the processes in the [process group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group). You can obtain the same effect by sending the signal to the process group instead of sending it to one of the processes. To send a signal to a process group, first determine its leader: that's the first process that starts all the others; if you run the process group in the background, that's the PID shown by `jobs -l`. The PID of the process group leader is the PGID (process group id); send the signal to its negative. E.g. if the PGID is 1234, run `kill -INT -1234`.\n\nIf the program consists of a wrapper script and a main application, there are two cases to consider. If there is no cleanup to do, so that the wrapper script terminates as soon as the main aplication terminates, make the wrapper script call `exec`:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nexport SOMEVAR=somevalue\n\u2026\nexec /path/to/application \"$@\"\n\n```\n\nThis way the application replaces the script, inheriting its PID. Some shells optimize a script that ends by executing another program, but not all. This approach doesn't work when the script needs to perform some cleanup such as removing temporary files.\n\nConsider making the script detect a signal and transmitting the signal to the application. Here's a sketch of how this goes:\n\n```\n/path/to/application \"$@\" &\napp_pid=$!\ntrap -INT 'kill -INT $app_pid'\nwait $!\nrm /temp/file\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Java application launched by a bash shell script is not responding to SIGINT signals sent via the `kill` command, but it does respond to Ctrl+C when run in the foreground. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this behavior?\n\nA) The Java application is not properly configured to handle SIGINT signals.\nB) The bash shell script is intercepting the SIGINT signal and not forwarding it to the Java application.\nC) The SIGINT signal is being sent to the wrong process ID.\nD) The terminal's `isig` setting is disabled, preventing signal keys from working.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation is that the SIGINT signal is being sent to the wrong process ID. In the provided process listing, we can see that the Java application (PID 13509) is a child process of the bash shell script (PID 13405). When using the `kill` command, it's possible that the signal is being sent to the parent bash process instead of the Java process.\n\nTo correctly send the signal, you would need to either:\n1. Send the signal directly to the Java process ID.\n2. Send the signal to the entire process group by using a negative PGID (Process Group ID).\n\nOptions A and B are less likely because the application does respond to Ctrl+C, indicating that it can handle SIGINT signals and that the shell script is not intercepting them.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the `stty -a` output shows that `isig` is enabled, not disabled."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/11/30", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1192751", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/896171/"], "docs_id": 1192751, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say that I want the output of `ls` viewed in `nano` or `tilde`.\n\nI would do the following:\n\n```\nls >> tmp\nnano tmp\nrm tmp\n\n```\n\nI don't like this because it creates a dumpfile that I sometimes forget to delete.

This includes `nano` and `vi` on the terminal. Even the graphical text editor `gedit` supports it. However, `pluma` or `mousepad` do not support it, and instead will be instructed to create a regular file named `-`.

First rule of Python is to **never use `while` loop** (except when you cannot use any other loop). Here you can easily replace it with `for`:\n\n```\nfor i in primes:\n    if i == n:\n        return True\n\nreturn False\n\n```\n\nBut this is exactly what the `in` operator is set to replace:\n\n```\nreturn n in primes\n\n```\n\nIn addition for your `isPrime` reimplementing the Python core feature `n in primes`, the\n`item in list` gets slower than `item in set` as the number of items grows.\n\nThus for fastest code with almost least typing you can do:\n\n```\n>>> primes = eSieve(87400)\n>>> prime_set = set(primes)\n>>> 13 in prime_set\nTrue\n>>> # or if you want a function:\n>>> is_prime = prime_set.__contains__\n>>> is_prime(13)\nTrue\n\n```\n\n[`__contains__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__) magic method of the `set` returns true if the given value is in the `set` \\- this is much faster using it directly than wrapping `in` operator in a function."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the most efficient way to check if a number is prime using a pre-computed list of primes in Python?\n\nA) Use a while loop to iterate through the list of primes:\n```python\ndef isPrime(n):\n    i = 0\n    while primes[i] <= n:\n        if primes[i] == n: return True\n        i += 1\n    return False\n```\n\nB) Use a for loop to iterate through the list of primes:\n```python\ndef isPrime(n):\n    for prime in primes:\n        if prime == n: return True\n        if prime > n: break\n    return False\n```\n\nC) Use the 'in' operator with the list of primes:\n```python\ndef isPrime(n):\n    return n in primes\n```\n\nD) Convert the list to a set and use the __contains__ method:\n```python\nprime_set = set(primes)\nisPrime = prime_set.__contains__\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most efficient approach.

Sharply defined wavefronts need an odd number of spatial dimensions, in even\\-dimensional space the wavefront decays with a long tail.

Needing to quote arguments only comes into play when you're dealing with a shell, and if `find` is calling `rsync` directly, there is no shell involved. Using visual output isn't a good way to tell if it works or not because you can't see where each argument begins and ends.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n```\n# touch \"foo'\\\"bar\"\n\n# ls\nfoo'\"bar\n\n# find . -type f -exec stat {} \\;\n  File: \u2018./foo'\"bar\u2019\n  Size: 0           Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: fd00h/64768d    Inode: 1659137     Links: 1\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1004/ phemmer)   Gid: ( 1004/ phemmer)\nAccess: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\nModify: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\nChange: 2017-12-09 13:21:28.742597483 -0500\n Birth: -\n\n```\n\nNotice that I didn't quote the `{}` in the arg to `stat`.\n\nNow that said, your command is going to be very non\\-performant, because you're calling `rsync` for every single matching file. There are 2 ways you can solve this.\n\nAs others have indicated you can use pipe the file list to `rsync` on stdin:\n\n```\n# find . -type f -print0 | rsync --files-from=- -0 . dest/\n\n# ls dest/\nfoo'\"bar\n\n```\n\nThis will use null bytes as the file name delimiter since files can't contain null bytes in their name.\n\nIf you're using GNU `find`, you have another method of invoking `-exec`, and that's `-exec {} +`. In this style `find` will pass more than one argument at a time. However all the arguments are added to the end of the command, not in the middle. You can address this by passing the arguments through a small shell:\n\n```\n# find . -type f -exec sh -c 'rsync \"$@\" dest/' {} +\n\n# ls dest/\nfoo'\"bar\n\n```\n\nThis will pass the list of file to the `sh` which will then substitute them in for the `\"$@\"`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the find command to locate files and directories for use with rsync, which of the following approaches is most efficient and handles special characters in filenames correctly?\n\nA) Use double quotes around {} in the find command, like:\n   find . -type f -exec rsync -av \"{}\" /destination/ \\;\n\nB) Use single quotes around {} in the find command, like:\n   find . -type f -exec rsync -av '{}' /destination/ \\;\n\nC) Pipe the find results to rsync using null-byte delimiters, like:\n   find . -type f -print0 | rsync --files-from=- -0 . /destination/\n\nD) Use find's -exec with a shell command to handle multiple files at once, like:\n   find . -type f -exec sh -c 'rsync \"$@\" /destination/' {} +\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A and B are incorrect because they still process files one at a time, which is inefficient, and quoting {} is unnecessary when find calls rsync directly.\n\nOption C is the correct and most efficient approach.

For example, we certainly find an entry **Dehn, Max, 1878\\-1951**. For other names, less information is known, such as **Pick, G., 1859\\-1943(?)**. This latter question mark reflects the fact that [Georg Pick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Alexander_Pick) died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942, and finding this information might have been difficult at the time of the writing of the book (1982\\).\n\nAll names in this list have a source for where their obituary may be found, and at least one of a birthyear or death year is present \\-\\- except for one name. This name is listed simply as **H. Vogt: ?\\-?.**, with no further information. Curiosity piqued, this gives my question:\n\n**Who was H. Vogt? What were his mathematical contributions?**\n\nHere's the clues I've got this far. The most relevant piece of information is the following paper:\n\n* *Vogt, H.*, Sur les invariants fondamentaux des \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles lin\u00e9aires du second ordre. , Ann. Sci. \u00c9cole Norm. Sup. (3\\) 6 (1889\\), 3\u201372\\. (Th\u00e8se, Paris),\n\nThis paper is the only paper cited by Chandler and Magnus for Vogt, and is hence the only publication I am certain is by the desired H. Vogt. It also appears to have been his Ph.D. thesis. No result can be found on Mathematics Genealogy matching this.\n\nThere are a number of matches on MathSciNet for publications by an H. Vogt; the earliest is from 1879, by a Heinrich Vogt, and this could in principle be the same H. Vogt as above. The latest that could conceivably be by our H. Vogt is from 1923 \\-\\- this is again on differential equations, so seems very likely to be by the same author!\n\nThis would give a (very!) rough idea of (1860\\-1930\\) as the lifespan of our dear H. Vogt \\-\\- perhaps this helps the search.\n\nOne idea is that H. Vogt could possibly be related to (father of?) [Wolfgang Vogt](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59429), a young German mathematician whose last paper was in 1914, and who may well have perished, as did so many other young German academics at the time, in World War 1, such as [Werner Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Boy), of [Boy's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy%27s_surface) fame, and [Hugo Gieseking](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gieseking). The topic of his 1906 Ph.D. thesis seems \\-\\- at least on a surface level \\-\\- somewhat related to what H. Vogt did, especially if some of the other publications on MathSciNet were by the same H. Vogt.\n\nNote: there is a 1932 paper by someone called H. Vogt, namely *Vogt, H.*, [**Max Wolf.**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asna.19322471702), Astronomische Nachrichten 247, 313\\-316 (1932\\).

If an answer is wrong and helpful, it's wrong and unhelpful. In that case, downvote it. If others find that it's unhelpful as well, they'll downvote it and cause the answerer to either lose rep, or cause them to outright delete the answer. The former is a just \"punishment\" for bad answers, and upholds the quality requirements of the site, and the later prevents the bad answer from wasting anyone else's time.\n\nOr, think of it this way: if you flag an answer as factually incorrect, the responding moderator must have domain knowledge to decide what action to take. Voting offloads that work onto the community, where there's a much higher chance of getting someone with domain knowledge to judge the answer. Apparently there's actually a default denial reason for moderators that flags should not be used to report incorrect answers (thanks @Catija for pointing this out). \n\nIf you're mad because someone said something snippy to you and proved to be unhelpful later, I'd just cut your losses and move on.

The tone is unfortunate, but I wouldn't go as far as to suggest moderator intervention. \n\nI'll add though because I saw Anne's comment: if someone's commenting just to comment and abusing the purpose of comments (requesting clarification of the question), for the sake of cleaning up the site, you can flag it to have them cleaned.

I assume this is because I am still using the figure environment? But I need this for subfigure to work.

As in other induction motors, the rotating part is a squirrel\\-cage rotor. Starting is by means of \n>  a design that uses a continuous copper loop around a \n>  small portion of each motor pole, as illustrated in Figure 5\\-51\\. Currents in this copper loop delay the phase \n>  of magnetic flux in that part of the pole enough to provide a rotating field. This rotating field effect produces \n>  a very low starting torque compared to other classes of \n>  single\\-phase motors. Although direction of rotation is \n>  not normally reversible, some shaded\\-pole motors are \n>  wound with two main windings that reverse the direction of the field. Slip in the shaded\\-pole motor is not a \n>  problem, as the current in the stator is not controlled \n>  by a countervoltage determined by rotor speed, as in \n>  other types of single\\-phase motors. Speed can therefore \n>  be controlled merely by varying voltage, or through a \n>  multitap winding.\n\nBut when looking on the motor I have, it seems that copper wire is circulating through whole main winding, instead of only part of it. So how is it that additional magnetic field can be generated, to turn the rotor into motion?\n\n[![Shaded-Pole motor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaiyL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaiyL.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I suspect that your confusion is because you may be more familiar with the construction of Figure 1\\.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvDct.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvDct.png)\n\n*Figure 1\\.

If this option is not visible, it may be due to software version or settings that need to be adjusted.\n\nC) Creating a composite band would not solve the issue of calculating statistics for each band separately.\n\nD) While Python scripting could be used to automate the process, it's more complex and time-consuming than using the built-in tool functionality, assuming the band selection option is available.\n\nThe key is to utilize the built-in functionality of the Zonal Statistics tool to process each band individually, which is the most straightforward and efficient method when working with multi-band rasters."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/17", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/346764", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/20980/"], "docs_id": 346764, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I generate many random models (without considering the data at all) in a regression setting simply by randomly assigning coefficient values and then evaluating these models over the dataset with an error metric and choosing the best model based on this error metric would I still run into overfitting?\n\nEventually we will end up with the OLS solution (see comments). If this is the case how is Cross Validation different than this procedure? For example in a Ridge or Lasso regression setting I am still generating a bunch of models (indexed by $\\\\lambda$) and evaluating them on unseen data segment and choosing the best one.\n\nIt seems to me that CV works well with standard regularization methods like Ridge and Lasso is because the tried models are somewhat nested (i.e. Ridge is ordered by Rademacher complexity). Hence the Structural Risk Minimization principle kicks in. Otherwise CV looks like a dead end effort. If we use cross validation to compare bunch of unrelated models we will end up with the random model generation scenario that I described above.\n\nUnder the Structural Risk Minimization framework, for example in SVM, one bounds the error and reduces the model complexity.

CV is just a scheme how to retain independent cases to test some model.\n\nNote that if you select a model based on the CV results, this **model selection procedure** (including the CV) **is actually part of your training**. \n\nYou need to do an independent validation (rather, verification) of that final model (for which you can again use *another* CV as a strategy to retain cases independent of the training \\- see nested cross validation) in order to obtain a reliable estimate of its generalization performance. \n\nTo reiterate: the problem is not the CV, the problem is the data\\-driven model optimization (selection). \n\n> From this perspective random model generation should in theory overfit less than a penalized regression as my evaluation is on a bigger unseen data segment.\n\nThis I don't understand: why would the unseen data size differ?\n\n> Is there something in CV procedure that somehow mitigates the multiple testing problem?\n\nNo. \n\nThe only property of CV that slightly helps with multiple testing compared to a single split is that CV eventually tests all available cases, and is thus subject to somewhat smaller variance uncertainty due to the limited number of tested cases.

The documentation emphasizes that cross-validation itself is just a method for retaining independent cases to test models. However, when we use CV results to select a model, this selection process becomes part of the training and can contribute to overfitting. The key point is that CV doesn't inherently prevent overfitting (ruling out A), and the model selection based on CV is not separate from training (ruling out B).

I imagine that intuitively the load is no longer applied in a fully normal manner (orthogonal) onto the bridge, but I cannot convince myself. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fracture happens under tension \\- that is, when you pull on something hard enough, it rips. The key to understanding the arc design hinges on understanding that it lowers the maximum tensile force.\n\nTake a simple beam, support it at the ends, and hang something off the center:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ag8V.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ag8V.png)\n\nTension at the bottom, and compression at the top, are needed to balance the torque created by the vertical forces of the supports, and the load in the middle. Obviously, the further apart the supports are, or the greater the load, the greater the tension. When that tension reaches a critical value the beam will fail.\n\nNow if we shape the bridge into an arc, we get this:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtqNa.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtqNa.png)\n\nThe additional lateral forces on the arc cause compression in the beam, this reduces the net tension at the bottom and makes the beam better able to support the load. You can make things even better by spreading the load more evenly, designing the shape of the arc to better optimize the load distribution, etc \\- but the diagram should give you a sense of the underlying principle.\n\nUpdate\n------\n\nThe lateral forces are perhaps most easily understood by looking at a V shaped structure: you know intuitively that such a structure would collapse unless you provide some torque at the apex to keep the legs together, or provide sufficient friction at the base of the legs to keep them together. You can also see that the force needed near the hinge (which is provided by the red \"tension\" stress in my upper diagram) would need to be much greater than the force provided by friction at the bottom (lateral forces from the support on the arch).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OAEy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OAEy.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a bridge and needs to choose between a flat beam design and an arched design.

This compression helps to reduce the net tension at the bottom of the arch, which is the primary cause of failure in beam structures. By reducing the maximum tensile force, the arched design allows the bridge to support larger loads compared to a simple flat beam design. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the arch does distribute the load more evenly, it doesn't eliminate all tension forces. \nOption B is incorrect because the lateral forces actually decrease, not increase, the overall tension. \nOption D is incorrect because the arch design actually introduces more compressive forces, not eliminates them."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/10", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/330706", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 330706, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not a very active user on stackoverflow, but during my ten\\-year career as a developer I have often asked questions and received satisfactory answers.\n\nI noticed with disappointment that the only answer to the last 2\\-3 questions (which I later deleted) was solely \"Please edit this question to include a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example\".\n\n**I want to be clear: if I have the time and the way to reproduce a problem, I have enough experience to solve it by myself.**\n\nIf I ask a question, it is to have an opinion based \"on the clinical eye\" of someone who has more experience than me on a given topic.\n\nIf I have a health problem I don't go to the doctor after doing tons of tests, I go there to get his opinion on what is best to do.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I noticed **with disappointment** that the only answer to the last 2\\-3 questions (which I later deleted) was solely \"Please edit this question to include a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example\".\n> \n> \n> If I have a health problem I don't go to the doctor after doing tons of tests, I go there to get his opinion on what is best to do.\n> \n> \n> Comment: The point is that If I ask a question, it is to have an opinion based \"on the clinical eye\" of someone who has more experience than me on a given topic. \u2013 ElmoDev001 15 mins ago\n\nA doctor has time to go back and forth and can also see the problem, we need the problem to be presented to us in a complete form; the question (or answer) needs to be complete and stand on its own.\n\nIf you have a problem with your leg you don't cut it off, apply duct tape, and hobble down to the doctor complaining that there's something wrong with your leg; could they have a look at it \\- then they send you back home to get it.

See this [question](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/140403/53818).\n\nBut the standard API uses both approaches.\n\nSeparate factory:\n\n```\nDatatypeFactory.newInstance().newXMLGregorianCalendar(...)\n\n```\n\nStatic methods in same class:\n\n```\nCalendar.getInstance(...)\n\n```\n\nWhy is this? In what case would having static methods be better than having a separate factory?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Factory is probably one of the most misused patterns. People always talk about how it allows to easily switch to a different factory that generates different classes, but usually fail to notice that you can't do that with factory alone \\- you need some sort of dependency injection too!\n\nThe overhead seems small \\- use `CalendarFactory.newInstance().newCalendar()` instead of `Calendar.getInstance()`. But we wanted factory in the first place so we could easily switch factories and change the way objects are constructed. Can we really do that here? `CalendarFactory.newInstance()` is always the same function so it'll always return a factory object constructed the same way, which will create `Calendar`s in the same way. In order to change the `Calendar` creation process, we need to either change `CalendarFactory.newInstace` or `CalendarFactory.newCalendar`. How is that any better from having to change `Calendar.getInstance`?\n\nIf we want to be able to easily change the `Calendar` creation process, we had to use dependency injection \\- create a `CalendarFactory` object somewhere and pass it around. That way we can control which factory the methods we call and objects we construct use.\n\nThere is a drawback to this approach though \\- having to pass that factory object around introduces quite a burden on the programmer. Methods need an extra arguments \\- for **the entire call\\-chain** from where the factory is created to where it's used. Objects need an extra field that you need to supply even if you don't use any method that requires that factory(alternatively \\- you have to remember if you supplied it or not, and exception will be thrown if the factory field is not set. But this exposes the implementation as it forces the user to know which methods require setting the factory field).\n\nSince the overhead here is much bigger than the naive, worthless use of the factory, we can't just blindly apply the pattern(OK, I take that back \\- you can *always* blindly apply design patterns, and too many programmers do) and we actually need to think. Do we really need to be able to switch the `Calendar` creation process all over the place? Do we need it enough to introduce such burden on the programmers?\n\nIn the case of Java's `Calendar`, the answer was \"no\". Being able to tell what the time is differently, or to represent it differently in the memory, is not useful enough to have to pass around a `CalendarFactory` object all over the place."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the trade-off between using static factory methods (like Calendar.getInstance()) and separate factory classes with dependency injection for object creation in Java?\n\nA) Static factory methods are always preferable as they reduce code complexity and improve readability.\n\nB) Separate factory classes with dependency injection are always better as they allow for easy switching of object creation processes.\n\nC) Static factory methods are suitable when the flexibility to change object creation process is not critical, while separate factory classes with dependency injection are better when such flexibility is needed but come with increased complexity.\n\nD) There is no significant difference between the two approaches, and the choice should be made arbitrarily.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the nuanced trade-off discussed in the documentation. Static factory methods (like Calendar.getInstance()) are simpler to use and suitable when the flexibility to change the object creation process is not critical. They don't require passing factory objects around, which can simplify the codebase.\n\nOn the other hand, separate factory classes with dependency injection offer more flexibility in changing how objects are created, but they come with increased complexity. This approach requires passing factory objects through the entire call chain and can burden programmers with additional method arguments and object fields.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because static factory methods are not always preferable; their suitability depends on the specific needs of the application.

The command would be:\nflac -d input.flac -c | lame - output.mp3\n\nThis combination ensures compatibility and efficiency, as SoX might have issues with MP3 encoding in some versions, while 'lame' is a dedicated MP3 encoder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 'lame' doesn't read FLAC files directly. \nOption C is incorrect because ffmpeg, while capable, wasn't mentioned in the provided documentation. \nOption D is incorrect because 'flac' alone can't handle MP3 files."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/24", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/377385", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/123539/"], "docs_id": 377385, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Similar question: [How do you handle versioning in a multi\\-sided project?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/264238/how-do-you-handle-versioning-in-a-multi-sided-project)\n\nSince the question above was asked almost 4 years ago, I was wondering if any new ideas have emerged .\n\n\\-\n--\n\nWe have a situation where we develop a platform that will have multiple instances. For example:\n\n* [https://instance1\\.myplatform.com](https://instance1.myplatform.com)\n* [https://instance2\\.myplatform.com](https://instance2.myplatform.com)\n* [https://instance3\\.myplatform.com](https://instance3.myplatform.com)\n\nIn general, all instances should have a closely synced version lifecycle, but sometimes we may want to have a instance with the early\\-access version intended for testing. \n\nIn addition to above, we are going to have Android/iOS apps which will connect to some instance (user has to select which one). It is important to note that all instances operate on a different database \\- no replication should exists between any of these. \n\n**The problem:**\n\nOnce we make changes to server\\-side, we are going to release new version of both server and client version. \n\n**For servers**, it should be straightforward as we control which version is installed on which instance. \n\n**For clients**, as soon as we release a new client app version, users can pull it from respective store and get it installed, but what happens when they actually use the instance which is still running the old server version? Or when client is unable to update due to outdated Android/iOS version?\n\nAny idea on how do we handle that? \n\nOne thought I had was to provide an endpoint `/version.json` so the client app can get the server version and choose how to operate. But this, imho, could quickly lead to massive code bloating/duplication. What do you think?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Version your server API](https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/). The client doesn't need to know what the current version of the API is, the client needs to know what version of the API your instances support.\n\nThere are two general options for requesting a versioned resource. You can include the version you are requesting from in the URI, or you can include it in an HTTP header:\n\nExample including versioning in URI:\n\n```\nGET http://instance{x}.myplatform.com/v1/{resource}\n\n```\n\nExample including versioning in headers:\n\n```\nGET http://instance{x}.myplatform.com/{resource}\nX-API-Version: v1\n\nGET http://instance{x}.myplatform.com/{resource}\nAccept: application/json+v2\n\n```\n\nOf course, you could also choose to support both methods. Notice I'm only including the major version number. If you're adhering to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), the client really only needs to be aware of the major version number it is using (since that changes only when backwards compatibility breaks). You can choose to supply the entire version number if you like, but it may increase the logic you would need to handle on the server\\-side in order to determine what code needs to be executed. The client knows what version of API it was developed against, so it should be able to have that information readibly available when making requests.\n\nThis does mean that you need to have older versions of your API hanging around, but it makes sense since you have older versions of your client out in the wild with no control over when they get updated. You can monitor usage of your API by version and make the decision to pull the plug and completely remove them whenever it drops below some threshold.\n\nYour `/version.json` approach could be useful if your API instances can ever be in a state where they have different major versions they support. In that case, before the user selects which instance they wish to connect to, you would have to interrogate them and determine if they support the version of the API that the client requires. If they don't, then the client would not want to connect to them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is developing a platform with multiple instances and corresponding mobile apps. They need to handle versioning between server-side changes and client apps. Which approach is most recommended for managing API versioning in this scenario?\n\nA) Implement a /version.json endpoint on the server to allow clients to check the server version and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nB) Version the server API in the URI (e.g., http://instance.myplatform.com/v1/resource) and have clients request specific API versions.\n\nC) Use HTTP headers for API versioning (e.g., X-API-Version: v1) and have clients specify the version they support in their requests.\n\nD) Maintain separate codebases for each version of the server and client, deploying them independently to ensure compatibility.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most recommended approach according to the documentation. Versioning the server API in the URI allows clients to request specific API versions they were developed against, ensuring compatibility even when server instances may be running different versions. This method is explicit, easy to implement, and allows for better control over backwards compatibility.\n\nOption A (using /version.json) is mentioned as a potential solution but is criticized for potentially leading to code bloat and duplication.\n\nOption C (using HTTP headers) is also a valid approach mentioned in the documentation, but the URI method is presented first and is generally easier to implement and understand.\n\nOption D is not mentioned in the documentation and would be an impractical and maintenance-heavy approach.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the recommendation to version the API, supports multiple instances running different versions, and allows clients to specify which version they need, addressing the main concerns raised in the question."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/16", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/20213", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/7913/"], "docs_id": 20213, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm comparing the options between buying 1400 points for $19\\.99 vs 500 points for $7\\.25\\.

When a new vertical list is being built (and the OR starts a new vertical list) TeX reinitializes `\\prevdepth` and when processing ends it resets it to the old (outer) value.\n\nWith normal output routines (that ship out pages) that's okay as the `\\prevdepth` (after the output routine ends) will match the last box on the main vertical list if there is a remainder that was not put into box255\\. If the main vertical list is empty the value is wrong but that doesn't make a difference because TeX will use `\\topskip` on top of the first line so it is essentially ignored.\n\nBut the situation is different if the output routine puts material back to be reprocessed. In that case the last box on the main vertical list is a) either the box that was not used in the OR and that has a depth matching `\\prevdepth` or it is the last box from the stuff that the OR contributed (which may have a different depth).\n\nSo to make baselineskip calculations work correctly we would need to know which situation we are in: has everything been packaged into box255 or is there an unused remainder? If that question could be answered that would also solve the issue but this is to my knowledge not possible.\n\nAn alternative solution would be to pretend that the material generated by the OR has the same depth as the outer `\\prevdepth` but for this I would somehow need to know its value.\nKnowing its value is simple if we force the OR with an explicit penalty because then I can just save it and used the saved value. But what can be done if the OR is called by TeX on its own?\n\nThat's really the question above ... any idea (as sneaky as it needs to be) to somehow get at this value in this particular case?\n\nOr alternatively, any method to clearly determine whether or not the main vertical list is emptied.\n\nPlease note that I'm looking for a solution that works with all TeX engines, so doesn't make use of, say, lua programming.\n\nTo motivate a bit further, here is a short plain TeX file that shows the general problem (though here it could be fixed as we explicitly force the output routine):\n\n```\n\\tracingonline=1\n\\showboxbreadth\\maxdimen\\showboxdepth\\maxdimen\n\ntest with g to get a depth\n\n\\showthe\\prevdepth % we see the prevdepth from the last line\n\n% now assume we have some OR that traps the data and does something with it\n% afterwards it is pushing back new or changed data t build pages, In the example I\n% simply dropped the collected data and replaced it with soemthing else which has a different \n% \\prevdepth.

In that case we can use the depth of box 255 as a measure for the `\\prevdepth`calculations that will have taken place if there is any remainder in recent contributions, and use this to adjust the new depth to match that. An if there isn't any remainder then this doesn't really matter either. This trick is in fact already mentioned by Don Knuth in the TeXbook where he discusses an output routine that add index headings in random places in the text (and normal text has this nice property of having a depth smaller than `\\maxdepth` ... normally but unfortunately not always.\n\nHowever, this stops working if this can't guaranteed and the general case is what I was and am after. He is also correct in stating that finding out what the value of `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list is isn't really going to help us as such, so my question above was partly incorrect: we also need to know if there is in fact something on the recent contributions and if so deal with it.\n\nSo what I tried to get my head around over the last days if that is really impossible to find out within base TeX (or if it needs an extension in luatex or is already available there and resolved in ConTeXt ... would be interesting to learn about it beside that claim @Martin you made). And as it stands now it is possible in TeX after all. The solution is a bit complex and perhaps it can be simplified further but it is not so complex that it can't be used (and hopefully not too complex that I overlooked some cases).\n\nThe main idea is not to try to determine the situation directly but instead use 2 output routines in succession that just ensure that the recent contributions are empty. Along the way we gather enough information to afterwards dissect the material gathered and do whatever we like.\n\nMy initial idea of using `\\aftergroup` to regain control and have a look doesn't work because the token inserted that way will not be executed when the output routine ends. Instead TeX immediately calls again on a procedure \"buildpage\" that takes anything on recent contributions and moves it to the main vertical list and only once that has happened my inserted token is looked at (in other words too late).\n\nSo the more complicated approach is that the first OR puts box255 back but only it has changed `\\vsize` to the largest possible dimen. Additionally it uses `\\aftergroup` so that we gain control later again. As we have changed `\\vsize` we will get everything including the material recent contributions onto the main vertical list and only then our control token kicks in. Finally we change the output routine to a second one and then return.\n\nThe token inserted by `\\aftergroup` will then issue a forcing penalty (actually it does a little more, see below) so that everything is grabbed and the second OR is called.\n\nInside that OR we are now in a better situation:\n\n* we know that recent contributions is empty (except for a (`\\penalty 10000`)\n* we can store away what was gathered in box255\n* or we could manipulate it using `\\vsplit` etc to get, for example the amount split of that we would have gotten in the first OR\n* and we can use `\\aftergroup` to gain control after the OR has ended.\n* the latter allows us to change `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list to represent whatever is needed\n\nAnd that should (I believe) do the trick completely.\n\nHere is the (more or less documented code including a bit of test data to play out various scenarios). It is a bit longish but largely because I tried to properly document the most important aspects and some of the more subtle points.

It needs to be created programmatically and exists only for the duration of the script or session.\n\nOn the other hand, enabling \"Create spatial index\" in Layer Properties or using createSpatialIndex() method creates a persistent spatial index, typically stored as a .qix file for shapefiles. This index primarily improves the speed of rendering (zooming and panning) for the layer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the purposes of the two indexing methods. Option C is incorrect because QgsSpatialIndex() doesn't create a .qix file, and \"Create spatial index\" can work with both in-memory and file-based layers.

Let $V$ be regular scheme of finite type over $\\\\text{Spec }k$ (not necessarily smooth). Is it true that $\\\\text{Spec }K\\\\times\\_{\\\\text{Spec }k}V$ is also regular?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, and it is only necessary to assume $K$ is separable over $k$ (i.e., not necessary to assume in addition that $k$ is algebraically closed in $K$). The idea is to use Serre's regularity criterion to reduce to the case when $K/k$ is finitely generated, and then use a separating transcendence basis in such cases to conclude.\n\nIn more detail, write $K \\= \\\\varinjlim K\\_i$ for subfields $K\\_i$ finitely generated over $k$, so all $K\\_i$ inherit $k$\\-separability from $K$. We may assume $V$ is affine, say $V \\= {\\\\rm{Spec}}(A)$. Clearly $K \\\\otimes\\_k A \\= \\\\varinjlim (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)$, so for any prime ideal $P$ of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ we have\n$$(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P \\= \\\\varinjlim (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_{P\\_i}$$\nwhere $P\\_i$ is the contraction of $P$ along $K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A \\\\rightarrow K \\\\otimes\\_k A$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over \n$(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ for a prime ideal $P$ of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$, so it is also finitely presented since $(K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ is noetherian (as $A$ is finitely generated over $k$). For ease of notation, let $R \\= (K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ and let $R\\_i \\= (K\\_i \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_{P\\_i}$ for all $i$, so $\\\\{R\\_i\\\\}$ is a directed system of local rings with direct limit $R$. Note that the transition maps in this directed system are *flat*, and $\\\\dim R\\_i, \\\\dim R \\\\le \\\\dim(A)$.\n\nSince $M$ is finitely presented over $R$, clearly \n$M \\= R \\\\otimes\\_{R\\_{i\\_0}} M\\_0$ for some $i\\_0$ and a finitely generated $R\\_{i\\_0}$\\-module $M\\_0$. Assume the case of finitely generated separable extensions is settled, so the local noetherian ring $R\\_{i\\_0}$ is regular, visibly with dimension at most $\\\\dim(A)$. Hence, $M\\_0$ admits a finite projective resolution over $R\\_{i\\_0}$ of length at most $\\\\dim(A)$ by Serre's criterion. Applying the *exact* functor $R \\\\otimes\\_{R\\_{i\\_0}} (\\\\cdot)$ to this yields a finite projective resolution of $M$ over $R$ of length at most $\\\\dim(A)$. Thus, the local noetherian ring $R \\= (K \\\\otimes\\_k A)\\_P$ has finite global dimension (at most $\\\\dim(A)$) since $M$ was arbitrary, so $R$ is regular by Serre's criterion. Since $P$ was arbitrary, it follows (by definition) that $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is regular. This completes the reduction to the case when $K$ is finitely generated over $k$.\n\nNow we may and do assume $K$ is finitely generated over $k$, so via the existence of a separating transcendence basis we reduce to the two special cases that $K \\= k(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n)$ or $K$ is finite separable over $k$. In the first case, $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is a localization of $A\\[x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_n]$, and this polynomial ring is regular (since it is $A$\\-flat with fiber algebras over $A$ that are regular and even polynomial rings over fields), so $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ is regular. In the second case one can conclude via the original definition of regularity via regular systems of parameters (any regular system of parameters in the local ring of $A$ at a prime $P$ is also a regular system of parameters in the local ring of $K \\\\otimes\\_k A$ in any prime over $P$ since $K \\\\otimes\\_k (\\\\cdot)$ commutes with the formation of Jacobson radicals in semi\\-local noetherian rings due to $K$ being finite separable over $k$).

The file is visible in Finder but cannot be opened, and terminal commands like `ls` and `lsof` show errors. What is the most likely cause of this issue and the best initial approach to resolve it?\n\nA) The file is infected with a virus and should be immediately deleted using antivirus software.\n\nB) There's a filesystem corruption, and the user should boot into Recovery Mode and repair the disk using Disk Utility.\n\nC) The file name contains invalid characters, causing system errors. Renaming the file should resolve the issue.\n\nD) The file is locked by the system. Changing file permissions using chmod command will allow access.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The issue is likely caused by filesystem corruption or damage, as evidenced by the sandbox errors in the log and the inconsistent behavior of the file. The best initial approach is to boot into Recovery Mode and use Disk Utility to repair the filesystem. This can resolve many filesystem-related issues without risking data loss. While the unusual filename (mixing Roman and Hebrew characters) contributes to the problem, simply renaming may not fully resolve the underlying issue.

There exists no holomorphic function on \u03a9 whose real part is u. This can be proven using two main approaches:\n\n1. Using real analysis and the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n   If such a holomorphic function f = u + iv existed, its imaginary part v would satisfy \u2207v = (-y, x)/(x^2+y^2). Integrating \u2207v along any circle x^2+y^2 = \u03c1^2 (where r < \u03c1 < R) yields 2\u03c0, contradicting the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals.\n\n2. Using the identity theorem:\n   If such a holomorphic function f existed, consider g(z) = f(z) - log(z) on the slit annulus \u03a9\\(-R,-r). The real part of g would be zero, implying g is a constant imaginary function. However, this contradicts the fact that f should be continuous on the negative real axis while the principal branch of log is not.\n\nBoth methods lead to contradictions, proving that no such holomorphic function can exist on \u03a9."}}
