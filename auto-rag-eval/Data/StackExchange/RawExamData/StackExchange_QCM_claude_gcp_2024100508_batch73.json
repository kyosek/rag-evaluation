To get around that restriction, software such as Cindori's TRIM Enabler allowed TRIM to be used on 3rd party SSDs. Later, OS X 10\\.10 (Yosemite) introduced a security requirement called kext signing which prevented TRIM Enabler from working without completely turning off kext signing. Then in OS X 10\\.10\\.4, Apple introduced a \u201ctrimforce\u201d command which enabled TRIM on 3rd party SSDs without turning off kext signing. (I have sources but Stack Exchange won't let me post more than 2 links)\n\nContrary to many of the comments here, the interface DOES matter. The vast majority of USB enclosures do not support TRIM, but allegedly there are some that support it such as the JMS 578 USB bridge controller (source: [http://bbs.pceva.com.cn/thread\\-125643\\-1\\-1\\.html](http://bbs.pceva.com.cn/thread-125643-1-1.html)). All five of the USB 3 enclosures / docks I have support it. Firewire supposedly supports TRIM, but I haven't tested it. Most Thunderbolt enclosures should support TRIM, and I currently have TRIM enabled on a SanDisk Extreme SSD in an Akitio Thunderbolt 2 enclosure. I used the trimforce command in terminal to enable it.\n\nIn order to check if your enclosure supports TRIM, you\u2019ll want to go to Apple \\> About This Mac \\> System Report \\> Hardware \\> SATA/SATA Express \\> and look for \u201cTRIM Support\u201d under the enclosure specs. If TRIM Support is not listed, your enclosure most likely does not support TRIM. If it is listed but says \u201cNo\u201d, you can try turning TRIM on by using the trimforce command in terminal. Just open Terminal and type \u201csudo trimforce enable\u201d. Once your computer restarts, check System Report again to see if TRIM Support changed to Yes.\n\nFinally, TRIM does matter, even for modern SSDs with sophisticated garbage collection. I experienced this firsthand when my SanDisk SSD started slowing down as it got older before enabling TRIM on it. There\u2019s a good, but somewhat outdated article about it here: [http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/ask\\-ars\\-my\\-ssd\\-does\\-garbage\\-collection\\-so\\-i\\-dont\\-need\\-trim\\-right/](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/ask-ars-my-ssd-does-garbage-collection-so-i-dont-need-trim-right/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about TRIM support on Mac OS X is correct?\n\nA) TRIM support was first introduced in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) for all SSDs.\nB) The interface used to connect an external SSD (USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt) has no impact on TRIM support.\nC) The \"trimforce\" command was introduced in OS X 10.10.4 to enable TRIM on 3rd party SSDs without disabling kext signing.\nD) TRIM is unnecessary for modern SSDs with sophisticated garbage collection.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because TRIM support was first introduced in OS X 10.6.8, but only for Apple OEM SSDs.\nB is incorrect because the interface does matter. Many USB enclosures don't support TRIM, while most Thunderbolt enclosures do.\nC is correct. The \"trimforce\" command was indeed introduced in OS X 10.10.4 to enable TRIM on 3rd party SSDs without turning off kext signing.\nD is incorrect. While modern SSDs have sophisticated garbage collection, TRIM still matters and can improve performance, especially as SSDs age."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/244983", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/78215/"], "docs_id": 244983, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For some reasons my table does not center which is odd since I am doing exactly the same with another table in the same tex file and it works.

When I run `fdisk -l` it says that my HD doesn't contain a valid partition table. I have been reading a great deal about proper partitioning that leads me to believe that this is bad, but I have noticed no strange behavior or problems. What are the ramifications of not having a valid partition table? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is possible to have a filesystem directly on a block device with no partition table on it, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong with that. It just means you can have only one filesystem and nothing else on it (no swap partition, etc...). However, it is unlikely that such a block device is bootable. The bootloader (grub) usually sneaks itself into some free space that results when the disk is split up into partitions, and there would be nowhere to put it without that.\n\nSo yes, per [psusi](https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/7285/psusi)'s comment, the tool must be \"wrong\".\n\nWhat's possible is that your disk has a GPT partition table and no PC legacy partition table. `fdisk` only supports PC legacy partition tables, so it could be reporting that it can't find one. That's not supposed to happen because GPT partitions are supposed to contain a valid dummy fdisk partition table for backward compatibility, but I suppose it's possible. To check for that, use `parted` or `gdisk` or ask the kernel what it thinks the partitions are by looking at `/proc/partitions`.\n\nAnother possibility is that `fdisk` cannot read the disk for some reason (do you have permission? Are you root?)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has recently upgraded an Ubuntu system and discovers that fdisk -l reports the hard drive doesn't contain a valid partition table.

The fdisk tool only supports legacy MBR partition tables, so it reports no valid partition table when encountering a GPT-partitioned drive. This doesn't indicate a problem with the drive or data, just a limitation of the fdisk tool. The system can still function normally with a GPT partition table, which is becoming more common, especially on newer systems or those with large drives. To verify this, the administrator could use tools like parted or gdisk that support GPT, or check /proc/partitions to see how the kernel interprets the drive's partitions."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/02", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/420682", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/201959/"], "docs_id": 420682, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to know whether the bombarding a particle to transmute it into another particle releases or absorbs energy.

This means there is a negative mass defect, which indicates that energy must be supplied for the reaction to occur. The kinetic energy of the incoming alpha particle (4He) must be at least equal to the energy equivalent of this mass difference (\u0394E = mc^2) for the reaction to proceed. Option A is incorrect because a higher mass defect doesn't necessarily mean energy release in this context. Option C is wrong because a heavier product doesn't imply energy release.

At first, I was excited to see a variant proof (as it did not use the diagonal argument explicitly). However, as time passed, I began to see that the proof was just the old one veiled under new terminology. So, till now I believe that any proof of the uncountability of the reals must use Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nIs my belief justified?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mathematics isn't yet ready to prove results of the form, \"Every proof of Theorem T *must use* Argument A.\" Think closely about how you might try to prove something like that. You would need to set up some *plausible system for mathematics* in which Cantor's diagonal argument is blocked and *the reals are countable*. Nobody has any idea how to do that.\n\nThe best you can hope for is to look at each proof on a case\\-by\\-case basis and decide, subjectively, whether it is \"essentially the diagonal argument in disguise.\" If you're lucky, you'll run into one that your intuition tells you is a fundamentally different proof, and that will settle the question to your satisfaction. But if that doesn't happen, then the most you'll be able to say is that every *known* proof seems *to you* to be the same. As explained above, you won't be able to conclude definitively that every possible argument *must* use diagonalization.\n\n**ADDENDUM** (August 2020\\). Normann and Sanders have a [very interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07560) that sheds new light on the uncountability of $\\\\mathbb R$. In particular they study two specific formulations of the uncountability of $\\\\mathbb R$:\n\n$\\\\mathsf{NIN}$: For any $Y:\\[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$, there exist $x,y \\\\in \\[0,1]$ such that $x\\\\ne\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} y$ and $Y(x) \\=\\_{\\\\mathbb{N}} Y(y)$.\n\n$\\\\mathsf{NBI}$: For any $Y\\[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$, either there exist $x,y \\\\in \\[0,1]$ such that $x\\\\ne\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} y$ and $Y(x) \\=\\_{\\\\mathbb{N}} Y(y)$, or there exists $N\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$ such that $(\\\\forall x\\\\in \\[0,1])(Y(x) \\\\ne N)$.\n\nOne of their results is that a system called ${\\\\mathsf Z}\\_2^\\\\omega$ does not prove $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$. Their model of $\\\\neg\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ can therefore be interpreted as a situation where the reals are countable! Nevertheless we are still far from showing that Cantor's diagonal argument is needed to prove that the reals are uncountable. A further caveat is that Normann and Sanders argue that the unprovability of $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ in ${\\\\mathsf Z}\\_2^\\\\omega$\u2014which might at first sight suggest that $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ is a strong axiom\u2014is an artificial result, and that the proper framework for studying $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$ is what they call a \u201cnon\\-normal scale,\u201d in which $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$ are very weak. In particular their paper gives lots of examples of statements that imply $\\\\mathsf{NIN}$ and $\\\\mathsf{NBI}$. I suspect, though, that you'll probably feel that the proofs of those other statements smuggle in Cantor's diagonal argument one way or another.\n\n**ADDENDUM** (December 2022\\).\nI just listened to an [amazing talk by Andrej Bauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CBFUojXoq4), reporting on joint work with James Hanson.\nIf you start listening around [14:53](https://youtu.be/4CBFUojXoq4?t=893), you'll see how, in the context of intuitionistic logic, one can formulate precisely the question of whether there is a proof of the uncountability of the reals that doesn't use diagonalization. Bauer and Hanson don't answer this question, but they construct something they call a \"parameterized realizability topos\" in which *the Dedekind reals are countable*. In particular, this shows that higher\\-order intuitionistic logic (in which one cannot formulate the usual diagonalization argument) cannot show the reals are uncountable. Now, you could still justifiably claim that this whole line of research does not really address the original question, which I presume tacitly assumes classical logic; nevertheless, this still comes closer than anything else I've seen."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding proofs of the uncountability of real numbers?\n\nA) All proofs of the uncountability of real numbers must explicitly use Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nB) It has been mathematically proven that every possible proof of the uncountability of real numbers must use some form of diagonalization.\n\nC) In classical logic, it is currently not possible to definitively prove that all proofs of the uncountability of real numbers must use Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nD) Recent developments in intuitionistic logic have conclusively shown that the uncountability of real numbers can be proven without any form of diagonalization.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

In the Galactic frame, the coordinate values are much larger (order of 1e20, 1e10, and 1e17 for x, y, and z respectively) compared to the GCRS frame (order of 1e6, 1e6, and 1e2). Given the precision of 1e-15 for 8-byte floating point numbers, the larger values in the Galactic frame lead to less precise calculations, especially when taking the norm of these coordinates. This results in an accuracy of order 1e5 meters for the Galactic frame calculations, which is much larger than the actual separation between the objects. The GCRS frame, with its smaller coordinate values, doesn't suffer from this precision loss to the same extent, leading to more accurate results."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/21", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/179542", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/50914/"], "docs_id": 179542, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to define a function *Lettrine* from the *lettrine* one.

It will return the pathname of the directory that was created, and we store this value in `tmpdir`.1\n\nThis `tmpdir` variable could then be used when following the same procedure that you are already doing, with `bar` replaced by `\"$tmpdir\"`:\n\n```none\nmv foo \"$tmpdir\"\nmv \"$tmpdir\" foo\nunset tmpdir\n\n```\n\nThe `unset tmpdir` at the end just removes the variable.\n\n---\n\n1 Usually, one *should* be able to set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a directory path where one wants to create temporary files or directories with `mktemp`, but the utility on macOS seems to work subtly differently with regards to this than the same utility on other BSD systems, and will create the directory in a totally different location. The above would however work on macOS. Using the slightly more convenient `tmpdir=$(TMPDIR=$PWD mktemp -d)` or even `tmpdir=$(TMPDIR=. mktemp -d)` would only be an *issue* on macOS if the default temporary directory was on another partition and the `foo` directory contained a lot of data (i.e. it would be slow)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to move a directory named 'foo' into a subdirectory of itself with the same name on macOS.

Using 1100 turns on the primary and 44000 turns on the secondary would best minimize the no-load magnetizing current while maintaining the required voltage ratio.\n\nA) This option would provide the correct turns ratio for the voltage transformation but would result in a very high magnetizing current, which is undesirable.\n\nB) This is the correct answer because increasing the number of turns reduces the magnetizing current needed to establish the same flux in the core. The induced EMF is proportional to flux linkage, which is proportional to the square of the number of turns. By significantly increasing the number of turns while maintaining the correct ratio, we can achieve the desired voltage transformation with a much lower magnetizing current.\n\nC) While increasing core cross-sectional area can help reduce core losses, it doesn't directly address the issue of magnetizing current as effectively as increasing the number of turns.\n\nD) Using a smaller core cross-sectional area would likely increase core losses and wouldn't be as effective in reducing magnetizing current compared to increasing the number of turns.\n\nThe key concept here is that by increasing the number of turns while maintaining the correct ratio, we can achieve the desired voltage transformation with a much lower magnetizing current, which is a crucial factor in transformer efficiency and performance."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/11", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/46601", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/13479/"], "docs_id": 46601, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the GM games I've watch it's very rare to see a game ending in less than 10 mins. They seem to like going two base first before attacking.\n\nEven if one player is Zerg, they still go with the early two bases and the Zerg doesn't ling rush at all, even if it seems like a logical choice considering the opponent won't have many units; lings can easily destroy the second base.\n\nAre there special rules in GM games (no rush) or do they just like to have a real war game (mass units).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I'm aware, there aren't any official rules about rushing. Early game rushes and all\\-ins don't work nearly as well against the high level players as they do against the weaker or casual players. A player who has very good control over his drones can easily defeat a 6 pool, for example.\n\nAlso, rushing is very hard on the economy, for no guaranteed reward. You say that the lings could easily destroy the second base, but that's not always true. Unless the opponent is doing a high risk early second base, such as Nexus first protoss, then they almost always will have at least some way to try and defend such an attack. If the rusher doesn't do significant damage, then they are stuck with fewer workers, wasted resources on the assault, and only on a single base, which means a significantly harder middle game.\n\nThe size of the map is also a large factor, as well as how early the player scouts and gets scouted. With larger maps, rushes become very risky as it takes longer to reach the opponent's base, giving them time to get units of their own, not to mention the time it takes to scout out said opponent's position.\n\nThere are certainly more factors involved, including the players' predisposition to rushes, but the players that reach that level of play have generally done so by mastering a combination of macro and micro. Rushes get punished much more frequently, and so most players don't believe that the risk is worth the reward at that point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In high-level StarCraft II gameplay, particularly among Grandmaster (GM) players, early rushing strategies are less common.

The documentation explains that early game rushes and all-ins are less effective against high-level players due to their superior micro-management skills and ability to defend. Additionally, rushing carries significant economic risks, as it requires heavy resource investment with no guaranteed reward.

The preference for longer games is a result of strategic choices, not entertainment value.\n\nAnswer D is an exaggeration.

There is no rule that predicts which words have this pronunciation, so you have to memorize it. The \\[\u028a] sound occurs in German as an allophone of /u/ in closed syllables. The vowel \\[\u028a] is shorter, more lax, and slightly centralized relative to \\[u]. This sound also tends to come from an older long /o/, though the reasons for this split are complicated and obscure.\n\nA very small number of words with *oo* are pronounced with an \\[o] vowel: *door*, *floor*.

Does that number go up for the bigger ships, or will I still just need 4? Is there any reason to have more crew other than the occasional risk of some dying?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: tl;dr\n=====\n\nalways\\* go with a full house\\*\\*, keep enough spare Rations, and be Unaccountably Peckish.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*unless  \n a) you already have Eschatologue, \\>100 skills, and some game experience \\- by then, if you already did all the most crew\\-risky stories, you can probably safely keep the crew to 32 people to have both a nice spare crew buffer and low\\-ish Hunger increase at the same time,\n\nb) you're broke or almost broke (for the obvious reasons),  \n\nc) you've decided you're going South to explore the Elder Continent; since you're getting your crew reduced to either 1 or 0, the starting amount can be safely kept as low as possible *smirks*. this is the one situation where Steam Launch does come in handy *chuckles*.\n\n\\*\\*or full house minus one, if you wish to benefit from (rather rare though) \\+1 zailor random events\n\nTo reiterate: you need 1/2 of the max crew *of a given ship* to be able to keep you engine at regular max (2x) speed (so yeah, the number goes up for bigger ships, as would common logic suggest) \\- having ship speed at 1x means 2x time used, 2x food consumption, 2x terror, 2x zee\\-risks etc.; still, if you're a serious player, you'll want to have **a full house**. *The more the merrier*, yeah? It's not just an opinion though; sadly, the other answers are wrong, because they have overlooked a couple of quite important factors. I'll explain them one by one. **Go science!**\n\nFirstly, **increasing your crew doesn't necessarily increase your food consumption!** Hunger is *quantized* (as you can easily verify on <http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/Hunger>), so unless you're just beginning your game (and have a 10 crew sized ship), there *ain't no Supply upside to having e.g. 19 crew instead of 24* \\- both will (in 99% of the situations) chew through your biscuits at exactly the same speed! In reality, you're likely to see an impactful difference only on the smallest (10 crew, 40 cargo\\-ish) ships. Even in those starting cases, you should *never* aim for \"1/2\\+1\" (e.g. 6 crew on your starting ship), for the reasons described further below.\n\nSecondly, **crew is cheap**. You can easily get 1 crew for 5 to 15 E in London (depending on luck and circumstances) \\- and that means just pocket change for fully staffing even the biggest ships. Hell, *crew is usually cheaper than rations* (unless you're in Naples, that is), so you're still usually *much better* off with 30 crew and 0 rations than with 16 crew and 5 rations, Hunger\\-wise. I won't provide the grim details here, but I *strongly* suggest getting [Unaccountably Peckish](http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/Unaccountably_Peckish) ASAP to *any* serious Zee\\-Captain. While feasting, don't use [Mouths to Feed](http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/Mouths_to_Feed) (it is 1\\.5x more efficient zailor\\-wise, but about 2x less efficient Terror\\-wise) \\- wait for [STARVATION WALKS THE SHIP!](http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/STARVATION_WALKS_THE_SHIP!). Note that paying the (quite slight IMO) \\+5 Terror cost gives you \\-50 Hunger (half the bar) for one crew \"donation\" (1\\-2 zailors) on that event, as opposed to \\-20 Hunger for \\+1 Terror choice there. If you keep your Terror low (\\<50\\) most of the time and thus have some free Terror to spare, it does make a difference (for 30 crew ship) of about 5 vs 2 full bars fed, that is 10 vs 4 Rations, respectfully.\n\nZee is unforgiving, my dear mates.\n\nThirdly, if you're a beginner, it's **extremely easy to lose crew** (mostly because it takes a lot of play time to know where you'll lose crew and to be able to avoid it) \\- OTOH, if you're experienced, you're probably Merciless, so it's also **extremely easy to lose crew** (yup, there's a pattern here *smirks*) \\- and the consequences are very dire. While you probably won't have 0 crew as a result of those encounters, getting below 1/2 crew is an almost instant death in most of those situations.\n\nAs to those \"sticky situations\" \\- high terror triggers crew death events; many random events trigger *multiple* crew loss on failure (some even on success) \\- creature attacks on less than 1/2 hull triggers crew death (often more than 1 for larger beasts). Imagine you're fighting a zee\\-beast with the \"1/2\\+1\" crew pattern described in other answer. Let's even say it's a smaller beast or a small vessel, with only \\-1 crew attack (if it's a \\-2 or bigger, you're screwed already). You got hit once too many (got to about 1/2 hull) so you decide to show that discretion is the better part of valour. You try to escape, hit full throttle, *but the beast charges* (most of them do) and is lucky enough to score a hit, throwing you at the shore. You just got to 1/2 crew, but *theoretically* you can still escape \\- well, not in this case, because before you can turn your ship and get out of the beast's range, *it charges again* \\- this time reducing your crew to 1/2\\-1, effectively making it impossible for you to escape *even on full throttle*. Hope you've written your Will, mate.\n\nAs to the story encounters \\- as you probably guess, you can easily lose e.g. 2 crew in them \\- and then you'll probably have to go half\\-speed all the way to London (or recruit in Khanate for the outrageous prices they have), making you not only lose many more rations that those spare crew would eat, gain a lot of unnecessary Terror and turn you into a sitting duck for Zee\\-monsters \\- it also wastes a lot of your RL time. I hope that makes my point here.\n\nFourthly, **since crew size is usually proportional to both the cargo capacity and the amount of Echoes you can earn on trades or recurrent events, the Supply downside is mostly negligible**. Let's define a quality, `crew size in Supplies` (e.g., for 10 crew it's just 10 Supplies). Just carry about 1\\.5x `csiS` for your regular travelling runs, about 1x `csiS` for cargo runs or travelling runs along Supply\\-rich ports, and about 0\\.5x `csiS` for cargo runs along Supply\\-rich ports. If you Supplies drop below that value, restock ASAP *before spending Echoes on anything other than Fuel* (i.e. Fuel still has priority). You'll never have to worry about Supplies again (well, at least not until you *forget to restock* or are extremely unlucky, which is quite common on the Zee *chuckles*).\n\nFifthly, **excess crew is just Nice**. Not only you can take more risks (e.g. you can go down to about 1/3 max Hull while fighting and *don't mind the crew loss at all*, you can trigger those [potentially high\\-gain, highly\\-crew\\-lossy events](http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/Mt_Nomad#Interactions) etc.), but you can also just *go to Naples with them*. Bear in mind that hauling cargo there *always* costs you 1 to 3 crew, but, at the same time, gives you an average net income of about 200 Echo and 30 Fragments per run (crew recruitment cost included). As such, if the Canal is along your route, you can just drop the spares there.\n\nSo, to sum up, **always\\* recruit up to max when you're in London**. *You* won't regret it (in worst case, [*they'll* regret it](http://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/Menaces:_Unaccountably_Peckish) *chuckles*).\n\nalso, FWIW, I find the WE ARE CLAY a bit lacking; benefits of \\-3 to crew and \\+5 Iron with a very minor Engine Power gain is IMO hardly worth it to waste a ship's Auxiliary (\\+7 to any stat, Pages probably, or \\+10 to all with Zong of the Zee) slot alongside losing one more possible cargo run on Naples and increasing the risk of crew deficit. YMMV, though; it certainly doesn't hurt much to have them stored *just in case of emergency* in your cargo hold."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information given about crew management in Sunless Sea:\n\n1.

Along with some rules on how to use [*\\-ly*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ly) which do not mention that the use of a word such as *parallelly* may be incorrect.

The answer I am looking for probably makes a distinction between variants of English. I'll flag the post which provides the most comprehensive answer as the accepted answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a question of grammar. You're looking for a word to qualify the way A and B are used, in the construct \u201cto *verb* A and B *qualifier*\u201d. This qualifier has to be an adverb (\u201ca word or phrase that modifies or qualifies an adjective, verb, or other adverb or a word\\-group\u201d).\n\nNow, you want to express parallelism. \u201cParallel\u201d itself is an adjective, as well as a noun and a verb. It is not an adverb, and as such, cannot be used in \u201cusing A and B parallel\u201d. The natural adverb that derives from parallel is *parallelly*; though it's not exactly very common in general usage, it does exist and is attested in multiple (though not all) dictionaries. So, \u201cusing A and B parallelly\u201d works.\n\nRegarding *in parallel*, it so happens that it is a common phrase meaning \u201coccurring at the same time and having some connection\u201d. It may be more commonly used than parallelly, which is why it would feel very natural in your sentence, but both are correct."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the usage of \"parallel\" and its derivatives in English is most accurate?\n\nA) \"Using A and B parallel\" is grammatically correct because \"parallel\" can function as an adverb.\n\nB) \"Parallelly\" is not a valid word in English and should be avoided in formal writing.\n\nC) \"In parallel\" is the only correct way to express the concept of parallelism in the given context.\n\nD) Both \"using A and B in parallel\" and \"using A and B parallelly\" are grammatically correct, with the former being more common in everyday usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the information provided. \"In parallel\" is a common and accepted phrase meaning \"occurring at the same time and having some connection.\" \"Parallelly\" is a valid adverb derived from \"parallel,\" even though it's less common.

Create an other layer (layerB) with some dragable features. Create a DragFeature control for this layer as well. Activate the control. Add the layerB to the map.\n\nNOTE: At this point, only the last added layer, layerB, will have working Drag events.\n3. Create a SelectFeature control, even if you don't need one, for both layerA and layerB:\n\nnew OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature(\\[layerA, layerB], {...});\n4. Activate the SelectFeature.

As a consequence my knowledge of other universality classes is very poor.\n\nMy question is simple: What other universality classes are there and what are their properties?\n\nI know there are as many universality classes as there are RG fixed points, so my question can never be answered completely. A list of 4 or 5 (equilibrium) universality classes that are well established and understood would however give me the feeling that there is more than Ising model out there.\n\nI will of course very much welcome references to literature. The reviews that I know on RG usually focus on general aspects and give few examples.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Two systems belonging to the same universality class will have the same critical exponents.\n\nThere are many things that determine the universality class of a system, one being its dimension.\n\nThe **2D Ising model** is one of the most studied system in statistical mechanics because it admits an [exact soultion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#Onsager.27s_exact_solution), found by Lars Onsager in 1944\\. Its critical exponents are:\n\n$$\\\\alpha \\= 0 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta \\= 1/8 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\gamma \\= 7/4 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\delta \\= 15 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\nu \\= 1 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\eta\\= 1/4$$\n\nBut let's take the (experimental) values of the critical exponents for the **3D Ising model**:\n\n$$\\\\alpha \\= 0\\.110 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta \\= 0\\.327 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\gamma \\= 1\\.24 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\delta \\= 4\\.79 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\nu \\= 0\\.630 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\eta\\= 0\\.0364$$\n\nSo the 3D Ising model belongs to a different universality class.\nOr we can take **2D [percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory)** (which is exactly solvable):\n\n$$\\\\alpha \\= \\-2/3 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta \\= 5/36 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\gamma \\= 43/18 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\delta \\= 91/5 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\nu \\= 4/3 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\eta\\= 5/24$$\n\nSo another universality class.\nOther universality classes will be for example that of 3D percolation, the [Heisenberg model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_model_(quantum)) or the [Van der Waals gas](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/tuckerman/stat.mech/lectures/lecture_25/node2.html). Here is a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_class).\n\nI conclude by saying that every system has an *upper critical dimension* (es D\\=4 for the Ising model and D\\=6 for percolation), above which the critical exponents become constant and can be computed using mean\\-field theory. The ***mean\\-field values*** of the critical exponents are:\n\n$$\\\\alpha \\= 0 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta \\= 1/2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\gamma \\= 1 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\delta \\= 3 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\nu \\= 1/2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\eta\\= 0$$\n\nThese values are the same as the ones of the Van der Waals gas; so the VdW gas, the $4(5,6,7\\...)$\\-D Ising model and the $6(7,8,9\\...)$\\-D percolation are examples of systems belonging to the same universality class: the mean field class."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying critical phenomena in various systems.

I have looked up the topic in the web, but only found that the bodies apply forces on each other for some short interval of time and not how they move *during* that interval. After the collision, the two bodies may go in the opposite directions, or in the same direction, but in which direction are they moving during this collision, that is during this brief period of contact (whatever it is microscopically)? I don't know how to go about thinking this problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's read what says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision):\n\n> A perfectly elastic collision is defined as one in which there is no loss of kinetic energy in the collision. In reality, any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some kinetic energy to internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large\\-scale impacts are perfectly elastic. However, some problems are sufficiently close to perfectly elastic that they can be approximated as such. In this case, the coefficient of restitution equals one.\n\nSo what happens in the real case? Hard bodies are one which are not easy deformable. They get deformed in such a way that to some extend of energy the applied energy is kicked back in a short time.\n\nThere is nearly no dissipation of the energy out from the direction of the collision. In the direction of the collision the molecules get shifted but this shift has a minimal \\- in reference to an elastic body \\- extend and once has gone through the body returns very fast back and kick the other body.\n\n> In which direction are the two bodies moving during a collision?\n\nAt the first half of the collision the involved area is simply moving slower (gets deformed) as the whole moving body and at the second half this deformation vanishes completely again. If one of the bodies is in rest the description is a little bit different: In the first half of the collision the involved area starts moving and in the second half the body gains velocity faster the deformed area and the deformation vanishes.\n\nTo be more precise, the first and the second \"half\" are a little of different time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: During a collision between two hard bodies, what happens to the involved area of contact in the first half of the collision?\n\nA) The involved area moves faster than the rest of the body\nB) The involved area experiences no deformation\nC) The involved area moves slower and gets deformed compared to the whole moving body\nD) The involved area immediately rebounds, reversing the direction of motion\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, during the first half of a collision between hard bodies, the involved area of contact moves slower than the rest of the body and undergoes deformation. This is because the collision energy is initially absorbed by this area, causing it to compress or deform slightly before the energy is redistributed throughout the body and eventually returned in the second half of the collision.

I thought I remembered that collapsing factor levels this way was so severely deprecated that it would throw an error, but since it works for one column, it should (and does) work for multiple columns.\n\n```\n Example[3:4] <- lapply(Example[3:4], 'levels<-', c(\"Dissatisfied\",\"Satisfied\",\"Satisfied\") )\n Example\n  Service Year           Q1           Q2\n1      AS 2015 Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\n2      AS 2016    Satisfied    Satisfied\n3      PS 2015    Satisfied    Satisfied\n4      PS 2016    Satisfied Dissatisfied\n5      RS 2015 Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\n6      RS 2016 Dissatisfied    Satisfied\n7      ES 2015    Satisfied    Satisfied\n8      ES 2016    Satisfied    Satisfied\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a dataframe 'df' with multiple factor columns (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) containing levels \"Dissatisfied\", \"Neutral\", and \"Satisfied\", you want to collapse \"Neutral\" into \"Satisfied\" for all these columns simultaneously. Which of the following code snippets would correctly accomplish this task?\n\nA) df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")] <- lapply(df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")], function(x) {levels(x) <- c(\"Dissatisfied\",\"Satisfied\",\"Satisfied\"); x})\n\nB) df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")] <- lapply(df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")], 'levels<-', c(\"Dissatisfied\",\"Satisfied\",\"Satisfied\"))\n\nC) for(col in c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")) {\n     levels(df[[col]]) <- c(\"Dissatisfied\",\"Satisfied\",\"Satisfied\")\n   }\n\nD) df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")] <- sapply(df[c(\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\")], function(x) {\n     if(x == \"Neutral\") x <- \"Satisfied\"\n     return(x)\n   })\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct and most efficient way to collapse factor levels across multiple columns simultaneously. It uses lapply() to apply the levels<- function to each specified column, reassigning the levels as desired. This method is concise and directly modifies the factor levels without needing to create a new function or use a loop.\n\nOption A is close but unnecessarily complex, as it creates an anonymous function to do what the 'levels<-' function can do directly.\n\nOption C would work but is less efficient as it uses a for loop instead of vectorized operations.\n\nOption D incorrectly uses sapply() and attempts to change values rather than factor levels, which would not preserve the factor structure and might introduce errors."}}
