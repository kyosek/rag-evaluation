In any case, I'm aware of rebasing being dangerous after pushing.\n\nOTOH, I see the point of trying to package 5 commits in a single one to make it look niftier (specially at in a production branch), however, personally I think would be better to be able to see partial commits to a feature where some experimentation is done, even if it is not as nifty, but seeing something like \"Tried to do it way X but it is not as optimal as Y after all, doing it Z taking Y as base\" would IMHO have good value to those studying the codebase and follow the developers train of thought. \n\nMy very opinionated (as in dumb, visceral, biased) point of view is that programmers like rebase to hide mistakes... and I don't think this is good for the project at all.\n\nSo my question is: have you really found valuable to have such \"organic commits\" (i.e. untampered history) in practice?, or conversely, do you prefer to run into nifty well\\-packed commits and disregard the programmers' experimentation process?; whichever one you chose, **why does that work for you?** (having other team members to keep history, or alternatively, rebasing it).\n\n---\n\n1 per [Google DVCS analysis](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/DVCSAnalysis), in Mercurial \"History is Sacred\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **History** is sacred, the **Present** is not. You can split your DVCS \"tree\" in two parts:\n\n* The **past**/history which contains an accurate view of how you have reached the current state of the code. This part of the history grow over time\n* The **present** which part you are currently working on to make you code evolve. This tip most part of the history have about always the same size.\n\nEvery code you released or used somehow is part of the **past**. The past is sacred because you need to be able to reproduce a setup or understand what introduced a regression. **You shall never ever rewrite the past**. In git you usually never rewrite anything once it is in master: master is the **past** part of the history. In Mercurial you have this [public phase concept](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Phases) that keep track of the **past** part of your \"tree\" and enforce its immutability.\n\nThe **present** part of the code are the changeset you are currently working on. The feature branch that you are trying to make usable, bugfree and properly refactored. **It is perfectly fine to rewrite it** it is even a good idea because it make the **past** part more pretty, simple and usable. Mercurial track this in the *draft* phase.\n\nSo yes, please rebase if it improves your history. **Mercurial will prevent you to shoot yourself in the foot** if you are rebasing stuff you should not."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A development team is debating whether to adopt a strict \"no rebase\" policy or to allow rebasing in certain circumstances. Which of the following approaches best aligns with the principles discussed in the documentation while maximizing the benefits for both code history and developer workflow?\n\nA) Implement a blanket ban on rebasing to preserve the entire commit history, including all experiments and mistakes.\nB) Allow rebasing only on personal branches before merging into the main branch, treating the main branch as the \"sacred\" history.\nC) Encourage frequent rebasing on all branches to maintain a clean, linear history throughout the entire repository.\nD) Use rebasing exclusively instead of merging to ensure a simplified history across all branches.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concepts presented in the documentation, particularly the distinction between \"sacred\" history and mutable present work. The correct answer, B, aligns with the principle that \"The History is sacred, the Present is not.\"\n\nOption A, while preserving all history, doesn't take advantage of the benefits of rebasing for improving code organization before it becomes part of the main history. This misses the opportunity to create a more coherent narrative in the codebase.\n\nOption B strikes the right balance by allowing developers to use rebasing as a tool to organize their work (the \"present\") before it becomes part of the immutable history (the \"past\"). This approach respects the idea that released or used code should not be rewritten, while still allowing for cleanup of experimental work.\n\nOption C goes too far by encouraging rebasing everywhere, which could lead to rewriting public history that others may depend on. This violates the principle of keeping the past \"sacred.\"\n\nOption D is an extreme approach that doesn't align with the documentation's nuanced view on the appropriate use of rebasing. It fails to recognize the value of preserving some aspects of development history.\n\nThe correct approach (B) allows teams to benefit from rebasing for cleaning up work-in-progress while still maintaining an accurate and immutable history of released code.

Black holes do not reflect or emit electromagnetic waves (except Hawking radiation which may be too small amount for seeing purpose). The reason for not reflecting and not emitting is that the enormous gravity of the black hole does not let anything including light, escape from it.\n\nHowever if scientists succeed in detecting the gravitational waves, then it will be possible to see some black holes in form of gravitational waves.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Black holes do not emit or reflect electromagnetic waves (except for negligible Hawking radiation), ruling out options A and C which rely on detecting various forms of light.\n\n2.

The documentation mentions that \"if scientists succeed in detecting gravitational waves, then it will be possible to see some black holes in form of gravitational waves.\"\n\nOption B is the correct answer because gravitational wave detection is the only method mentioned that could potentially allow direct observation of a non-interacting black hole. This approach doesn't rely on electromagnetic radiation or particles escaping the black hole, but instead on detecting distortions in spacetime caused by the black hole's intense gravity.\n\nThe distractors (A, C, and D) represent common misconceptions about black holes, such as thinking they emit detectable radiation or particles.

The documentation shows that both Super User and Server Fault blogs are using identical stylesheets located at \"/wp-content/themes/zimpleza/style.css\", indicating they share the same WordPress theme.\n2. To customize Super User's appearance while maintaining the base theme structure, creating a child theme is the most appropriate solution. This allows for overriding specific styles without modifying the parent theme directly.\n3. Option A is incorrect because clearing cache wouldn't solve the root issue of shared stylesheets.\n4. Option B is plausible but incorrect, as the problem isn't related to CDN usage but rather to shared theme files.\n5. Option D is incorrect because the user's question and the subsequent fix implemented by the Stack Exchange team indicate that differentiation is desired and allowed.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a real-world web development scenario, integrate multiple concepts (WordPress theming, CSS inheritance, and web development best practices), and apply critical thinking to determine the most effective solution."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/17", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/180644", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/220863/"], "docs_id": 180644, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I occasionally see this behavior on stackoverflow: a question is asked, someone provides an answer.

Given the system information provided, what is the most likely cause of the extra network interface and the best approach to resolve the boot delay issue?\n\nA) A remnant configuration from a previously installed network card; remove the corresponding configuration file in `/etc/network/interfaces.d/`\nB) A kernel module loading an unused driver; blacklist the unnecessary network driver in `/etc/modprobe.d/`\nC) A virtual interface created by a containerization tool; disable the relevant container networking service\nD) A physical secondary network interface detected by the system; configure it properly or disable it in BIOS/UEFI\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple pieces of information from the provided system output. The key points leading to the correct answer are:\n\n1. The `lspci` output shows two Ethernet controllers, indicating the presence of two physical network cards.\n2. The `ifconfig` output lists both `eth0` and `eth1`, with `eth1` showing no network activity.\n3. The `/etc/network/interfaces` file doesn't contain any configuration for either interface.\n4. The `systemctl` status for both `eth0` and `eth1` shows \"Unknown interface\" messages.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely scenario is that the system has detected both physical network interfaces (option D), but they are not properly configured. This can lead to boot delays as the system attempts to initialize and configure the unconfigured interface.\n\nThe other options are plausible distractors but less likely given the evidence:\n- Option A is incorrect because there's no indication of remnant configurations in the interfaces file.\n- Option B is unlikely because the kernel is successfully detecting both physical hardware interfaces.\n- Option C is not supported by the evidence, which points to physical rather than virtual interfaces.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the administrator should either properly configure the second interface if it's needed, or disable it in the BIOS/UEFI if it's not required.

I am stuck beyond that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Step 1**\n\n3 is always a prime factor. \n\n**Step 2**\n\nWe show that there are infinitely many numbers of the form $11, 111, \\\\ldots$ which are divisible by any $x$, where $x$ is not a factor of $2$ and $5$.\n\nConsider $S \\= \\\\{11, 111, 1111, \\\\ldots, 111111111111111\\\\}$ (15 ones in the last one). So there are $14$ numbers in this set. Divide each one by $13$, and then the remainder modulo $13$ for each number is from $0$ to $12$. Since there are $14$ remainders (from the set S) and only $13$ possible outcomes, therefore there are $2$ numbers for which, the remainder is the same. Then the difference of these two numbers is now divisible by $13$. This difference is of the form $11111\\\\ldots00000$ ($a$ $1\u2019s$ and $b$ $0\u2019s$). That means the number $1111\\\\ldots111$ (with $a$ $1\u2019s$) from this set is divisible by $13$. \n\nThis means there are infinitely many numbers of this form divisible by $13$. The same argument can be extended to any $x$. We cannot have $x$ multiple of $2$, $5$ because of the ending zeroes in the argument.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nFrom steps 1 and 2, though we have 3 has a factor of $10^n \\- 1$, we will not get a pattern, because for arbitrary $x$ (not multiple of 2 and 5\\), $x$ divides an infinitely many of the repunit numbers.\n\n**In short, there is no easy way to predict the factors**"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about prime factors of 10^n - 1, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is investigating the prime factors of numbers in the form 10^n - 1.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that for any x not divisible by 2 or 5, there are infinitely many numbers of the form 11...1 (repunit) divisible by x.

As the final circuit should be as small as possible, my component choices are very limited. \n\nFurthermore, the flyback switch should be driven by a max. voltage of 2V DC. My current problem is now, that there are currently no MOSFET devices available with a Vdss high enough.\n\nMy question now: Are BJTs feasible as a switch (higher breakdown voltage) and if so do they consume any power when turned off? (I am guessing not). Is it possible to drive them from only 2V?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have recently finished a similar design. We are now at the pre\\-production phase, having already validated the first prototypes, which operate perfectly under similar constraints as the ones you describe in your question. Because of IPR limitations, I can only give you some general guidelines.\n\nBased on the following assumptions:\n\n* You are trying to avoid the use of a transformer by all means (which may not be the case),\n* The power requirements of the load is in the miliwatt range,\n* You don't want to step\\-up the voltage supply first, but will use the 2VDC directly for powering your flyback design block.\n* You need to keep the cost and PCB space to the absolute minimum.\n\nI suggest the following approach:\n\n1. Rule out the MOSFET and use a fast switching high voltage BJT (rated at least to 200V, better yet to 300V).\n2. Select the most appropriate inductor for your constraints and depending on your requirements for maximum power delivered to the load.\n3. Calculate the maximum flyback voltage, and make sure you can get at more than 200V voltage flyback \"peaks\". The involved parameters here are: ILpk (inductor peak current), Cts (total sum of parasitic capacitances at the flyback node) and SWITCHING SPEED of the BJT.\n4. The last one is hugely important, and rarely mentioned in the technical literature. You may have a big ILpk and very little Cts, but if your switching (off) speed is not fast enough, the flyback voltage will suffer. Reminder: Vflyback \\= \\-L \\* dI/dt.\n\nThe above can be implemented with:\n\n1. A simple (single) inductor or\n2. A 1:1 coupled inductor.\n\nApparently, from the design equations point of view, there seems to be no need for the 1:1 coupled inductor, as the single inductor will work exactly as well, most probably with less resonance apparatus. However, using a 1:1 coupled inductor will help avoiding EMI generation. I suggest the use the 1:1 coupled inductor in case you have to EMI certify your final product.\n\n\\*\\* However the previous assumptions, should you want to explore the flyback transformer approach, there now exist very nice miniature (micro\\-power) SMD flyback transformers. \\*\\*\n\nFor instance, this Coilcraft model allows up to 1:100 turns ratio with 300Vrms isolation among primary and secondary coils:\n\n[http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235\\.cfm](http://www.coilcraft.com/lpr6235.cfm)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a compact flyback converter to charge a capacitor to 200V from a 1.5V input, with a maximum drive voltage of 2V DC.

The correct answer, B, represents the best compromise between performance, size, and EMI considerations. \n\nA single high-voltage BJT with a standard inductor (option A) would work but doesn't address potential EMI issues, which could be critical in a compact design.

The transformation proceeds as follows:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{2n+1} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2n+1)^{1/n}$\n\nThis can be rewritten using the exponential and natural logarithm:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} e^{\\ln(2n+1)^{1/n}} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} e^{\\frac{\\ln(2n+1)}{n}}$\n\nThis transformation is crucial for further analysis of the limit.

This requires a modification to the standard variation of the action.\n\nIn the usual approach, we consider terms involving the field \u03c6 and its first derivatives. However, with second derivatives present, we need to include an additional term in the variation of the action:\n\n\u03b4S = \u222bd\u2074x[\u2202L/\u2202\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 + \u2202L/\u2202(\u2202_\u03bc\u03c6) \u03b4(\u2202_\u03bc\u03c6) + \u2202L/\u2202(\u2202_\u03bc\u2202_\u03bd\u03c6) \u03b4(\u2202_\u03bc\u2202_\u03bd\u03c6)]\n\nThis last term is crucial and was missing in the initial attempt described in the question. By including this term and performing integration by parts twice, we can correctly derive the Klein-Gordon equation without the erroneous factor of 1/2.\n\nThe presence of second derivatives doesn't invalidate the use of variational principles, but it does require a more careful treatment of the variation.

The correct answer (C) is the most appropriate solution based on Ubuntu's security model and best practices. Here's why:\n\n1. It addresses the need for multiple users without compromising security.\n2. It leverages Ubuntu's sudo system, which allows non-admin users to perform admin tasks when necessary without constantly running with elevated privileges.\n3. It avoids sharing the admin password, which is a security risk mentioned in the original question.\n4. It's more secure than option A, which involves sharing the admin password.\n5.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"Contra-currents will minimise EMF,\" which is achieved by having current flow in opposite directions in adjacent conductors.\n\n2. Twisted pair cables are mentioned in the original question as a potential solution, and they are indeed commonly used in audio applications to reduce electromagnetic interference.\n\n3. Option A would create a strong magnetic field, as the currents in the same-direction windings would reinforce each other.\n\n4. Option C, while potentially reducing EMF, would create significant inductance, which is undesirable for a power supply in this application. The documentation notes that contra-currents with the same winding direction result in \"No inductance. No magnetic field.\"\n\n5. Option D, a single solenoid with bidirectional current, would not effectively cancel out the magnetic fields and would introduce unwanted inductance.\n\n6.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that a 20A receptacle cannot be used for a 25A load, even if derating brings the actual current to 20A.\n2. The breaker size must match the intended load (25A in this case), not the derated current.\n3. #10 THHN wire is appropriate for a 25A circuit.\n4.

I am happy to announce that we have met these goals. As of now, UI and Data changes are live network\\-wide that include showing the relevant CC versions for all post revisions and comments on all sites, updating footers, API updates, and other related sites.\n\nBefore detailing the changes, I will first address some of the open questions that remain [from our last update](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/344491/an-update-on-creative-commons-licensing).\n\n**The previous update defined the license changing from CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 to 4\\.0 on May 2, 2018\\. What happened on this date?**\n\nPrior to this date, the Terms of Service linked to CC BY\\-SA [3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). On this date, the link changed to point to the [4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. It was updated as part of a process that was not led by the Community Team and there was no public announcement at time due to an internal disconnect at the time of the release.\n\n**In that case, what about the change from CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5 to 3\\.0 that took place in [April 2011](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95033/51)? Shouldn\u2019t that also affect a similar change?**\n\nWe can now affirm that the same change in license that was posted on MSE to be effective as of April 8, 2011 (from version 2\\.5 to version 3\\.0\\) also could not have retroactively changed the license of content. The UI update laid out below will reflect this and will attribute each piece of content to the relevant license version.\n\nBased on this, we will be adopting the following rules relating towards classifying the licenses attached to content published on the site:\n\n* Content contributed before 2011\\-04\\-08 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 2\\.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).\n* Content contributed from 2011\\-04\\-08 up to but not including 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n* Content contributed on or after 2018\\-05\\-02 (UTC) is distributed under the terms of [CC BY\\-SA 4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\n**How do edits work? Can edits change the license on content that was already posted on the site?**\n\n* Every time that a piece of content is published, the work is published under the CC BY\\-SA version as defined above, based on the publish date.\n* Every time a piece of content on the site is edited by a user, the editor creates a new version of the previous version. The new version of that work is considered to be republished and therefore governed under the CC BY\\-SA version in effect as of the day on which the edit was made.\n* Each revision to a work creates a new version and is licensed separately. Thus current version of any piece of content (that appears on the site) is the most recent revision, and will have a license version based on the date on which that revision was published.\n* This applies regardless of the size, the magnitude, or the significance of the edit that was made (except for the cases outlined below which are exceptions to this rule).\n* New edits do not modify the license that is attached to an old revision of the same content. That old revision continues to be licensed under its original CC BY\\-SA version.\n\nThe UI changes as defined below will make it clear (through the timeline page) the license version that applies to every revision for each question, answer, and comment on all sites.\n\n**Are there any types of post edits that do not cause new licensed revisions or changes to the license on the post?**\n\nYes, there are a few:\n\n* Title or Body Rollbacks: do not create new licensed versions, as they do not add any content to that which was already published. The license on the post changes to the license on the rollback target revision.\n* Tag applications to questions are considered to be meta\\-data and are not included in the content that is being licensed. Thus, tag\\-only edits or rollbacks do not effect any license changes or create new licensed versions\n* The following system\\-initiated post edits do not create new licensed versions:\n\t+ [Commonmark migration](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348746/were-switching-to-commonmark) edits\n\t+ URL Rewrites\n\t+ http to https replacements\n\t+ MSO link to MSE link replacements\n\t+ Insert/remove duplicate link edits\n\n**What license is applied to posts that are labeled Community Wiki?**\n\nWhen attached to a post, the [Community Wiki](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts) label changes the display of the post on the site, and changes the way in which reputation is assigned.\n\nRevisions to CW posts are to be treated in the same way as any other content revisions on the site with respect to the applicable license: licensed using CC BY\\-SA based on the date that the revision is made (which will be identifiable through the post timeline).\n\n**How can users upgrade the license of content that they own on the site from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0?**\n\nWe are thinking about how we might enable users to mass update and republish their questions and answers (across all sites on the network) to change the license version from 2\\.5 or 3\\.0 to 4\\.0\\. This will require more discovery work on our end so we don't yet have a time frame on if or when this might be available, or how it would work. This feature would not add the ability to republish a subset of content. It would be all or none.\n\n**What will be the process for future license updates? Can I agree in advance to any license upgrades that Stack Overflow might adopt in the future for new content?**\n\nWe will try our best to announce future license updates on the network at least one month prior to their being adopted for new content. This will give time for the Community to react and give feedback on the change.\n\nAny future license version updates will only affect new content (or new revisions published based on existing content) that is published after the new versions are adopted on the network. There will be no way for a user to agree in advance to automatically adopt future license changes to their existing content.\n\n**So what changes have been made?**\n\n1. The timeline for every question and answer has been updated.\n\t1. The top of the timeline page (underneath the title of the post) lists the CC BY\\-SA version of the latest revision made to the post.\n\t2. A new column labeled \u201clicense\u201d has been added to the timeline table.\n\t3. Each line in the timeline labeled as \u201chistory\u201d where the action is \u201casked\u201d, \u201canswered\u201d, or \u201cedited\u201d has the CC BY\\-SA version that is applied to the given revision.\n\t[![Example of license display on the Timeline (some rows removed from screenshot for ](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oksyX.png)\n2. The share post popover now includes a link to the license version applied to the post (decorated with an `rel=\"license\"` attribute)\n[![Share popover including license link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQjZe.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQjZe.png)\n3. Comment versions:\n\t1. The tooltip on the comment date includes the license version applied to that comment on creation.\n\t2. If a comment had multiple revisions, the revision display that is available to moderators gives the license version that applied to each revision of the comment.\n4. Footer text, other references:\n\t1. All references to the license throughout the site (including on the TOS) have been changed to \u201cCC BY\\-SA\u201d (or the same in lower\\-case).\n\t2. Text requiring attribution is no longer written. This is [implicit](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Attribution_required) from the definition of the \u201cBY\u201d section of the license name.\n\t3. The network footer has been updated to no longer reference version 4\\.0 of the license, and will now link to the [/help/licensing](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing) page.\n\t4. Other references to the license in other sections of the sites on the network have been updated in the same way.\n\t5. Area 51 footer has been updated accordingly.\n\t6. The [create chat page](https://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/new) has been [updated](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/347536/51) accordingly.\n\t7.

Current license version number (4\\.0\\) is included in text of the ToS (and not just in the link). A sentence has been added to the licensing section making reference to this post to give more details on how licenses are applied to content.\n5.

The arm needs to respond quickly to input signals, but also maintain stability. Given that the circuit has a voltage source Vs = 12V, resistance R = 2k\u03a9, and inductance L = 4mH, what modification would most effectively reduce the circuit's time constant while maintaining the same steady-state current?\n\nA) Increase the resistance to 4k\u03a9\nB) Decrease the inductance to 2mH\nC) Increase the voltage source to 24V\nD) Add a capacitor in parallel with the inductor\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of RL circuit concepts in a real-world scenario. The time constant (\u03c4) of an RL circuit is given by \u03c4 = L/R. To reduce the time constant while maintaining the same steady-state current (Iss = Vs/R), we need to decrease L or increase R. However, increasing R would change the steady-state current, violating the question's constraint.\n\nOption A would increase the time constant and reduce the steady-state current, opposite of what we want.\n\nOption B correctly reduces the time constant by halving the inductance, which will make the circuit respond more quickly. This doesn't affect the steady-state current, meeting both requirements.\n\nOption C doesn't affect the time constant at all, as it's not dependent on the voltage source. It would increase the steady-state current, which isn't desired.\n\nOption D introduces a new component, changing the circuit from RL to RLC, which would complicate the behavior and potentially introduce oscillations, not necessarily reducing the response time in a controlled manner.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of RL circuit dynamics, time constants, and their relationship to component values, while also requiring consideration of real-world application constraints."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/29", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57130", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/26374/"], "docs_id": 57130, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an empty directory.

Generally I'd like to allow them to get comfortable talking about what they like rather than what they think I'd like. However, that might not work this time as the student is a non\\-native english speaker and may get less comfortable as I try to get him/her to talk more.\n\nThus far I'm thinking about watching how he/she solves different problems in different areas of math, but I would like to know if anyone has done this before or has any suggestions for evaluating a student who might not be comfortable talking much.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, I'm a non\\-native English speaker, so I can provide some insight. \n\nI think that one of the first problems would be names and notation in general. As far as I can see, there is no easy way to solve this unless you already know the customs of the country the student is coming from, but your education will probably make it easier to guess what means what. For example in my country we use $log\\_{base}number$ for general case logarithms, $lg$ for $log\\_{10}$ and $ln$ for $log\\_e$. Another example would be popular sets. In some countries 0 is a natural number and in some other countries it isn't. Another example would be popular trigonometric functions. In my country for example secant and cosecant are considered deprecated and aren't used. Same thing with grads as angle measurement units.\n\nProblems with this part can be especially tricky because they can stay undetected for a long time. I've seen some math problems whose solutions depend on whether zero is a natural number or not. Another example here can be integrals. As far as I can see the most popular name in English for operation opposite of finding a derivative is antiderivation. In my area that's called indefinite integration and the indefinite part if often omitted.\n\nStill I think that most of the notational problems can be solved with Wikipedia.\n\nNext part would be names of fields of mathematics and popular theorems. How big problems this is going to be is closely related to which language terms come from. Sometimes terms are going to be shared between languages and sometimes there will be no direct translation. For example in my language, there is no term for calculus. Instead we use mathematical analysis, which as far as I know is superset of calculus.  \n\nAlso in some cultures some theorems are named after famous mathematicians and in some other cultures they are named after what the theorem describes. I can't find any examples right now, but I know I encountered such problems when asking few questions here. \n\nAnother problem could be non\\-existence of a concept. For example I was unable to find any mention of [Ivan Vsevolodovich Meshcherskiy's equation](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=sr&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fru.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%25D0%25A3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE) [(original article here](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE)) for bodies with variable mass in any English language web\\-sites. Here it's considered one of the fundamental rocketry equations, right next to Tsiolkovsky's formula. While the example is related more to physics than mathematics, be prepared to find similar examples in mathematics if the student is coming from a different culture.\n\nSince you said that student knows some English, here's my recommendation: Try starting a conversation about some topic in English and see if student is familiar with it. If it doesn't ring a bell, be ready to provide simple examples related to the area. I sometimes had problems finding exact name for some field of mathematics but immediately recognized it as soon as I saw a few simple problems. Another good idea would be to make a list of alternative names for every operation and see if some of them are familiar.\n\nYet another important thing is to have at least some familiarity with mathematics program which the student followed. Sometimes focus of what's studied in classes can be a bit different than what's written on paper. I remember now back when I was in secondary school we had formal mathematical proofs in books and they were supposed to be a part of the curriculum, but teachers in schools just decided that proofs are not important and did not teach them. Also in some schools less attention was payed to proper use of terminology. I know some of my friends who didn't know what was derivative and it's graphical representations, but knew that $x^2{'}\\=2x$ and same thing for integrals. Another point can be some obvious areas which may have been skipped. When was in secondary school, we didn't learn almost any probability and statistics and did very little work with percentages. On the other hand I see that in some other countries it's expected that someone who has graduated from primary school can without any problems calculate his interest rate.\n\nI can't think of anything else to add at the moment..."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: As a math PhD interviewing a non-native English speaking high school student, you notice they struggle to articulate their mathematical interests verbally.

I know I can do this safely via the Finder. (By \"safely\" I mean that the app still starts up and works after copying/moving.)\n\nHowever I would like to do this via the command line.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource forks, will also be preserved. It also copies, rather than follows, symbolic links. Personally, this is what I use for copying apps.\n\nFor a total guarantee, including copying to other file systems such as FAT or NTFS you should use `ditto \u2014-rsrc` which saves all the neat stuff in `.AppleDouble` files on those file systems.\n\nIf you want more information I heartily recommend a close reading of the `man` page of both.\n\n`mv` is safe as houses so long as you are on the same volume and fine if both source and destination volumes are macOS formats.\n\nBy the way, you mistyped your example.

This option provides several key advantages:\n\n1. It offers a \"total guarantee\" for preserving all macOS-specific attributes, including resource forks and extended attributes.\n2. It works consistently across different file systems, including non-macOS formats like FAT or NTFS.\n3.

It eliminates the need for conditional logic based on file system types, simplifying the automation process.\n\nWhile options A and B might work in some scenarios, they don't provide the same level of universal compatibility and attribute preservation. Option A (`cp -pR`) may not handle non-macOS file systems correctly. Option B adds unnecessary complexity and potential points of failure.\n\nOption D is incorrect because `mv` is only safe for same-volume transfers, and `cp -pr` doesn't guarantee preservation of all attributes across different file systems.\n\nThe `ditto --rsrc` command ensures that all necessary data and attributes are preserved regardless of the source or destination file system, making it the most robust choice for automating the copying of macOS applications in a diverse environment."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/06/16", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/223926", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/115685/"], "docs_id": 223926, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a TH8 base and it's connected with\n Google\\+.\nI had to reset my phone a few days ago because it was giving me problems.\nAfter I reset my phone I logged into Google\\+ and installed the game,\n but it won't load!\n\nI have tried every possible thing, I updated the game and Google\\+ app and Google play games...everything.. but still could not recover my village... \n\nWhat can I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From one playthrough, I can have seen that it is always or almost always the case that NPC death **is** permanent.

Unsupervised learning algorithm is used to perform independent random sampling from majority class. Multiple classifiers based on the combination of each majority class subset with the minority class data are chosen.\n\nAnother example of informed undersampling uses the K\\-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to achieve undersampling. One of the [four methods on KNN](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/jzhang.pdf), looks most straightforward, called NearMiss\\-3, selects a given number of the closest majority samples for each minority sample to guarantee that every minority sample is surrounded by some majority samples. However, another method, NearMiss\\-2, in which the majority class samples are selected if their average distance to the three farthest minority class samples are the smallest, is proved the most competitive approach in imbalanced learning.\n\nThe profit (cost) matrix can be considered as a numerical representation of the penalty of classifying samples from one class to another. In decision tree, \n\n(1\\) cost\\-sensitive adjustments can be applied to the decision threshold; \n\nROC curve is applied to plot the range of performance values as the decision threshold is moved from the point where the total misclassifications on majority class are maximally costly to the point where total misclassifications on the minority class are maximally costly. The most dominant point on the ROC curve corresponds to the final decision threshold.

One possible end is that you go so far into debt that the banker will not accept the amount required to get you out of debt. Another possible end is just playing the game over and over again until the law of large numbers takes over, and you end up having an equal chance of making or losing money. In real life however, your odds are typically lower than 50/50, say 49/51, so even the second strategy is worse. You are guaranteed to lose money over a long period of time, compared to having a 49% chance of gaining money by just betting all on your first turn.

The correct answer is C, which aligns with the theorem's counterintuitive conclusion that \"the player's best chance of winning a stated sum at an unfavorable game is to stake the sum that will bring that return in one turn.\"\n\nOption A represents a common misconception that spreading risk over multiple bets is safer.

I have one fixed effect (Offset) and one random effect (chamber, with muliple data points coming from each chamber).\n\nIn the text book \"The R Book\", (2007\\), pg 604, Crawley suggests using the lmer function with a binomial family for the analysis of binomial data where each participant contributes multiple responses (analagous to each of my chambers contributing multiple outcomes). Based on this example, I have used the following script for my data:\n\n```\n    ball=lmer(Buried~Offset+(1|Chamber), family=binomial, data=ballData)\n\n```\n\nWhen I run this model, I get this warning:\n\n```\n    calling lmer with 'family' is deprecated; please use glmer() instead\n\n```\n\nWhen I change my code to the following, the model works:\n\n```\n    ball=glmer(Buried~Offset+(1|Chamber), family=binomial, data=ballData)\n\n```\n\nBased on other questions/answers that I have read on Cross Validated, lmer should only be used for data where the outcome is normally distributed, and glmer is the correct function to use for a binomial outcome. My questions are:\n\n1\\) Could anyone clarify the discrepency between Crawleys advice and the fact that lmer would not work for me (nor, based on what I have read on CVed, is it recommended to use this function for binomial data)\n\n2\\) Is glmer indeed the correct function to use to model a binomial outcome with random factors?\n\n3\\) Assuming that glmer is the correct function to use, I want to compare a model with and without random effects to determine if including random effects improves the fit of the model. I understand that glmer estimates model parameters via maximum likelihood. What function can I use to create a model with no random effects for a binary outcome using maximum likelihood? I was playing around with glm however the help file for this function states that the method of estimation is iteratively reweighted least squares (which is beyond me, but it isn't ML...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1\\) In previous versions of the `lme4` package, you could run `lmer` using the `binomial` family. However, all this did was to actually call `glmer`, and this functionality has now been removed. So at the time of writing Crawley was correct.\n\n2\\) Yes, `glmer` is the correct function to use with a binary outcome.\n\n3\\) `glm` can fit a model for binary data without random effects. However, it is incorrect to compare a model fitted with `glm` to one fitted with `glmer` using a likelihood\\-based test because the likelihoods are not comparable. From your description, you have repeated measures within chambers. So, assuming that you have sufficient chambers and these can be thought of as a random sample from a larger population of chambers, then *a priori* you should retain the random intercepts for `Chamber` to control for possible non\\-independence of observations within chambers. You can think of random intercepts as being part of the experimental design.\n\nOn the other hand, if the random effect variance is very small and/or the inference or predictions for both the `glm` and `glmer` model are the largely the same, then it really doesn't matter which you use anyway."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about mixed effects models and binary outcomes, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the effectiveness of a new fertilizer on crop yield across multiple farms.

The correct approach is to use glmer() with a binomial family and random intercepts for farms (option C) for several reasons:\n\n1.

Which approach would be most efficient and flexible for adding accurate dimension labels to all sides of the parallelepiped?\n\nA) Use the \\draw command with explicit coordinates for each label\nB) Implement a \\foreach loop to iterate over predefined label positions\nC) Utilize the transform canvas option with parameterized dimensions\nD) Apply the calc library to compute label positions dynamically\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and flexible approach for adding dimension labels to all sides of the parallelepiped is to utilize the transform canvas option with parameterized dimensions. This method, demonstrated in the advanced solution provided, offers several advantages:\n\n1. Parameterization: By defining variables like \\aesW, \\aesD, and \\aesH for width, depth, and height, the code becomes easily adjustable for different parallelepiped sizes.\n\n2. Consistency: The transform canvas option ensures that labels are consistently placed relative to the edges they're measuring, regardless of the parallelepiped's orientation or size.\n\n3. Readability: This approach keeps the labeling code concise and separate from the main shape drawing commands, improving overall code readability.\n\n4. Flexibility: It allows for easy modification of label placement (e.g., adjusting the offset from edges) without altering the core structure.\n\n5. Scalability: This method can be easily adapted to label additional dimensions or modified for similar 3D shapes.\n\nWhile options A and D are viable, they would require more complex calculations and be less flexible for adjustments.

Users report being unexpectedly logged out, especially those using privacy-enhancing tools. Which of the following scenarios is most likely causing this issue, and what potential solution should be recommended?\n\nA) The platform is using IP-based session management, causing issues for users with frequently changing IPs. Implement token-based authentication instead.\nB) Users' cookies are being invalidated due to a server-side caching issue.

Roll back the patch and develop a more compatible security solution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the given information and application of web security concepts. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that using Tor (which changes IP addresses frequently) is assumed to be the cause, but this is likely incorrect. The top answer states that changing IPs alone doesn't typically cause logouts.\n\n2. The expert response specifically highlights that \"It's more likely that your cookies are getting invalidated at some point or their servers just don't like you and keep dumping your session.\" This points directly to a server-side issue with session management, likely related to how cookies are handled.\n\n3. Option A is a plausible distractor because it addresses the IP change issue, but it's not the most likely cause according to the expert.\n\n4. Option C is tempting because it involves Tor, but there's no indication of bot detection being the issue.\n\n5.

Given the information provided, what is the most likely cause of this behavior and the appropriate solution?\n\nA) The systemd service is using the wrong user permissions; change the User directive in the service file to 'elasticsearch'\nB) The PID file handling is incorrect for systemd; add a PIDFile directive and change the service Type to 'forking'\nC) The wrapper script is not properly daemonizing Elasticsearch; modify the script to use nohup when starting the process\nD) Hostname resolution is failing in the systemd environment; add the server's hostname to /etc/hosts\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue lies in how systemd is managing the Elasticsearch process and its PID file. Several key points from the documentation lead to this conclusion:\n\n1. The wrapper script successfully starts Elasticsearch and creates a PID file, but systemd is not aware of this file.\n2. The systemd status shows the service as \"inactive (dead)\" immediately after starting, despite the wrapper script reporting a successful start.\n3. The original service file uses Type=simple, which assumes the process remains in the foreground.\n4. Elasticsearch is being started with the -d flag, which daemonizes the process.\n\nThe solution involves two changes:\n1. Adding a PIDFile directive to the systemd service file, pointing to the PID file created by the wrapper script (/var/run/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.pid).\n2. Changing the service Type from 'simple' to 'forking' to indicate that the process daemonizes itself.\n\nThese changes allow systemd to properly track the Elasticsearch process and its lifecycle. Option A is incorrect because the user permissions are not the primary issue. Option C is unnecessary since Elasticsearch already daemonizes itself. Option D, while addressing a visible error in the logs, is not the root cause of the service failing to start properly.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (systemd service management, process daemonization, PID file handling) and application of this knowledge to a real-world debugging scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "70": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/06", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2768934", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/324389/"], "docs_id": 2768934, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have very straightforward easy question, but I could not figure it out.\n\nYou are given a group $\\\\left( \\\\left\\\\{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} a \\&b \\\\\\\\ c \\& d \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\;\\\\big\\|\\\\;ad\\-bc\\\\not\\=0,a,b,c,d\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\_3 \\\\right \\\\},Matrix\\\\; Multiplication \\\\right)$\n\n***Question:*** Show that $\\|G\\|\\=48$\n\n***Given answer:***\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/piSvC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/piSvC.png)\n\nI do not get the red underlined sentence.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If $A$ is a matrix with two rows and two columns, $\\\\det A\\=0$ if and only if one of the rows is a multiple of the other one."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: In the group of 2x2 matrices over Z\u2083 with non-zero determinant, why is it crucial to consider the condition ad-bc \u2260 0 when determining the group's order?\n\nA) It ensures all matrices in the group are invertible\nB) It prevents division by zero in matrix operations\nC) It guarantees the group contains only integer elements\nD) It limits the group to only commutative elements\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The condition ad-bc \u2260 0 is crucial because it defines the determinant of a 2x2 matrix. In the context of this group, it serves multiple important purposes:\n\n1. Invertibility: Matrices with non-zero determinants are invertible, which is a requirement for group elements. This condition ensures that every element in the group has an inverse, satisfying a key group axiom.\n\n2. Group closure: The set of invertible matrices forms a group under multiplication, while including singular matrices would violate the group structure.\n\n3. Counting elements: This condition affects how we count the elements in the group. We need to exclude matrices where ad-bc = 0 in Z\u2083, which is key to arriving at the correct group order of 48.\n\n4. Relationship to linear independence: In Z\u2083, ad-bc = 0 if and only if one row is a multiple of the other, as mentioned in the additional information. This connects the algebraic condition to the geometric concept of linear independence.\n\n5.

But if your sample is small, using neural network is a bad idea anyway \\- use logistic reression or SVM instead, as it is more robust.\n\nDimensionality reduction and feature selection are also sometimes done to make your model more stable. But you can stabilize it by adding regularization (parameter `alpha` in the `MLPClassifier`).\n\nDimensionality reduction and feature selection lead to loss of information which may be useful for classification.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that dimensionality reduction is likely unnecessary for this problem, as 62 features is not considered high-dimensional.\n\n2.

There is nothing like another pair of eyes. So, at least this part of the question is already answered.]\n\nWell, it turns out the replacement does not work. Which made me investigate the circuit closer, which made me realize that I don't really understand how it works, much less why the replacement doesn't work. And the circuit is rather interesting and uses very few components. Note for example the lack of catch diodes.

Bringing one of the inputs low should switch on three transistors (for example, Q10, Q12 and Q14\\), but I don't see how just pulling the base of Q10 low would do that. Where does the voltage on Q12's base come from? There is no biasing, no pullups. Is bringing the base of Q10 low enough to start current flowing through Q12 (E\\-B)?\n* Why does replacing a 2SD882 with a BD238 not work? I have to understand this before I go looking for other replacements. \\[**Edit**: this part is already answered, I made the silly mistake of substituting a PNP transistor without noticing it.]\n* How important is PNP/PNP complementary pair matching in an H\\-bridge? I couldn't find any information on that. Everybody mentions that it's good to have a matching pair, but no rationale is given. I don't see how minor differences in hFE could (or should) influence the behavior of a simple motor driver circuit.\n\nThe toy car is powered by 4 D batteries (so slightly above 5 volts), and the motor draws about 0\\.4A in normal operation. I also measured the base current for the NPN H\\-bridge transistors when activated: it's 60mA when an 2SD882 is installed, and 2\\.2mA when the BD238 is installed.\n\nLinks to relevant datasheets, for easier access:\n\n* 2SD882: [http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439\\.pdf](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/1380439.pdf)\n* BD238: [https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238\\.pdf](https://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BD/BD238.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main problem is that the BD238 is a PNP transisor, not NPN!"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is troubleshooting a faulty H-bridge circuit in a radio-controlled toy car. The car only moves backward, and forward movement stutters. After replacing one of the NPN transistors (Q14) with a BD238, the problem persists. Which of the following best explains why the replacement doesn't work and what critical mistake was made?\n\nA) The BD238 has a lower hFE, causing insufficient current gain in the H-bridge\nB) The BD238 is a PNP transistor, fundamentally incompatible with the NPN circuit design\nC) The lack of catch diodes in the circuit causes voltage spikes that damage the BD238\nD) The lower Ic rating of the BD238 prevents it from handling the motor's current draw\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The critical mistake made was replacing an NPN transistor (2SD882) with a PNP transistor (BD238). This is fundamentally incompatible with the H-bridge circuit design, which relies on specific NPN/PNP configurations to control current flow direction. \n\nWhile options A, C, and D present plausible issues in H-bridge circuits, they are not the primary reason for the failure in this case. The lower hFE (A) might affect performance but wouldn't cause complete failure. The lack of catch diodes (C) is noted in the schematic but isn't directly related to the replacement issue. The lower Ic rating (D) could be a concern, but it's not the root cause here.\n\nThe question requires integration of multiple concepts (transistor types, H-bridge operation) and tests critical thinking by asking the student to identify the most significant issue among several potential problems.

You can no longer do accurate timing analysis with RTL code.\n\nSome models are written to be used in both RTL and structural simulations, so you can ignore these warnings. Even better would be to turn of the timing checks which improves RTL simulation performance (maybe not relevant on your project, but that what people do in industry)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An FPGA engineer is developing a controller for a low-power DDR module and encounters hold time warnings in their simulation. The functional model specifies a 1.5 ns setup and hold time for a critical signal, but the RTL design shows instantaneous signal changes. Which approach would be most effective in addressing these timing issues while maintaining design accuracy?\n\nA) Ignore the warnings entirely, as they are common in university projects and don't affect functionality\nB) Modify the RTL code to artificially introduce delays matching the specified setup and hold times\nC) Generate a post-place-and-route simulation model and use it with the functional model in a testbench\nD) Disable all timing checks in the simulation to improve performance and eliminate warnings\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the application of knowledge in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, is the most effective approach because:\n\n1. It addresses the core issue of timing discrepancies between the RTL and the actual hardware behavior.\n2.

Option B is a misguided attempt to artificially introduce timing into RTL, which is not how timing is typically handled in FPGA design flows.

Can anyone help me debug it or even help me understand what I did wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your code has several structural problems with the reactives and so on, and some possible more fundamental problems with shapefile.\n\nHere's a working version *with some caveats* that follow:\n\n```\nui=shinyUI(fluidPage(pageWithSidebar(\n  headerPanel(\"Header1\"),\n  sidebarPanel(\n      fileInput('layer', 'Choose Layer', multiple=FALSE, accept='asc'),\n      fileInput('shape', 'Choose gml', multiple=FALSE, accept=\"gml\")\n\n  ),\n  mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"mapPlot\")\n  )\n)))\n\nserver = shinyServer(function(input,output){\n\n    inFile <- reactive({\n        raster::brick(input$layer$datapath)\n    })\n\n    inShp = reactive({\n        readOGR(input$shape$datapath)\n    })\n\n    output$mapPlot<-renderPlot(\n    {\n        plot(inFile());\n        plot(inShp(), add=TRUE)\n    })\n})\n\n```\n\nNote that everything in the server function is either in a \"reactive\" or a \"renderer\". That's what was causing your initial problem.\n\nSecondly the file upload input returns a data frame with a `datapath` column which is where the file has been dropped. So in your code you would have been trying to read from `input$layer` which is a dataframe of upload data rather than `input$layer$datapath` which is the column with the file name you want.\n\nThirdly it is hard to make shapefiles work with shiny uploads. Shapefiles must have a `.shp` and a `.shx` component for `readOGR` to work, and possibly a `.dbf` and `.prj` component too. You can upload several files in a shiny upload widget (is that why you have `multiple=T`?) but the server renames them so that the data frame of `input$shape` contains the names `0.shp`, `1.shx`, `2.dbf` and so on. It might be possibly to rename these back together, but most shapefile upload solutions require users to upload a ZIP file of everything which is then extracted by the server.\n\nMy solution above, and in order to show how the reactive stuff works which was your first problem, is to load a GML file instead of a shapefile. In my test code I did `writeOGR(pts, \"pts.gml\",\"pts\", driver=\"GML\")` just to get something I could upload to shiny and plot over a raster."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is developing a Shiny app to visualize geospatial data.

In Shiny, operations that depend on user inputs must be wrapped in reactive expressions or observers to ensure they are re-executed when inputs change. \n\nOption C addresses this by suggesting to move these operations into reactive() expressions. This is the correct approach because:\n\n1. It ensures that the data processing only occurs when the input files change.\n2. It creates a reactive dependency that the renderPlot() function can rely on.\n3. It allows for proper error handling and lazy evaluation of the file processing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because observer() functions are used for side effects and don't return values, which is necessary for the plot rendering.\n\nOption B is incorrect as fileInput2() is not a standard Shiny function, and simply changing the input function wouldn't address the reactive context issue.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while renderLeaflet() could be used for map visualization, it doesn't address the core reactive context problem and wouldn't necessarily resolve the error.\n\nThis question requires understanding of Shiny's reactive programming model, file input handling, and common pitfalls in geospatial data visualization apps, testing the ability to analyze and apply multiple concepts from the documentation to a real-world scenario."}, "86": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/08", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/128765", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/1257/"], "docs_id": 128765, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are two sentences.\n\n> 1.

The correct answer, C, best captures the nuanced reality presented in the documentation:\n\n1. The documentation suggests that adding custom metadata is theoretically possible, as evidenced by the mention of standards like ITU-T and 3GPP that define cell phone networks.\n\n2. However, practical implementation faces several challenges:\n   - Classic GSM/3G/ISDN/UMTS standards have limited metadata capacity beyond basic call information.\n   - There's uncertainty about whether metadata sent by one handset would make it across the network to another handset intact.\n   - The availability of APIs to send or receive such data is questionable.\n\n3. Network heterogeneity is implied by the mention of various standards (GSM, 3G, 4G, LTE) and the uncertainty about newer interfaces' capabilities.\n\n4. The lack of standardized APIs is suggested by the absence of specific API mentions and the need to consult complex technical standards for definitive answers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the complexity of cellular networks and ignores the challenges mentioned.

Let's examine each option:\n\nA) While Eisenstein's criterion is a powerful tool, it's not applicable here even after transformations. This approach, though valid in general, is inefficient for this specific polynomial.\n\nB) Proving irreducibility in \u2124p[X] for some prime p is a valid method, but using a large prime like 31 is unnecessarily complex for this polynomial.\n\nC) This is the most efficient and correct approach. The polynomial is of degree 3, so if it were reducible, it would have a linear factor. The rational root theorem quickly shows that there are no integer roots (potential roots are divisors of 9: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19).

This sentence does indeed involve a relative clause. We could reconstruct the relative clause like this:\n\n* Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest **that I've ever gotten to a college graduation.**\n\nThe important thing about relative clauses is that they have a gap in them. The gap tells us where the missing element should be. So for example consider this sentence:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw yesterday].\n\nThis relative clause has a gap in it that tells you where *the man* would be in the clause:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw \\_\\_\\_ yesterday].\n\nBecause our language brain knows where the gap is we can understand the sentence like this:\n\n* This is the man that \\[you saw **the man** yesterday].\n\n**The relative clause**\n\nIt is not straightforward to understand exactly where the gap is here. This is because, as the Original Poster felt, we often associate relative clauses with a noun phrase antecedent. However, in this case the antecedent isn't a typical noun phrase. Here's where the gap is:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten \\_\\_\\_\\_ to a college graduation]\n\nWe understand it like this:\n\n* this is the closest that \\[I've ever gotten **close** to a college graduation].\n\nThis sentence is unusual because it has a superlative adjective as an antecedent, not a noun or clause. The verb *gotten* her means something like *come* or *been*.\n\n**The grammatical function of *closest***\n\nThe Original Poster asks if *the closest* is the Object of the verb *GET*, in this case part of the perfect construction *have gotten*. The answer is, no. However, it has a function similar to an Object. Like an Object, it is a Complement of the verb. But it is a Predicative Complement, not an Object. Like Objects, Predicative Complements fill a special slot set up by the verb. They don't tell us *what* someone was doing something to though and they don't introduce a new entity into the sentence. Instead Predicative Complements tell us something about the Subject or Object of the sentence. \n\nIn this case, the phrase *the closest that I've ever got to a college graduation* is the Predicative Complement of the verb *is*. It describes the situation denoted by *this*. Notice that this is *NOT* an adverbial. It is not an extra part of the grammar in the sentence. It is not an extraneous addition to the meaning either. The sentence is quite simply ungrammatical without it:\n\n> \\*Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is.

This is unusual because typically, relative clauses modify noun phrases. In this case, \"closest\" is not the object of \"gotten,\" but rather a predicative complement of the verb \"is.\" The relative clause \"that I've ever gotten to a college graduation\" modifies \"closest,\" with an implied gap that would be filled by \"close\" in a full clause (\"I've ever gotten close to a college graduation\"). This structure requires the reader to understand that \"closest\" is describing the situation referred to by \"this,\" not acting as an object. The use of \"gotten\" in this context means something akin to \"come\" or \"been.\" This grammatical construction allows Jobs to succinctly express the idea that this experience is the nearest approximation to a college graduation he has ever had, without explicitly stating it as such.

If that fails (e.g., on a System V system), it falls back to `cancel -a` to remove all jobs.\n3. `lpq || lpstat` is used again to confirm the jobs have been removed, working with either interface.\n\nThis approach demonstrates critical thinking by:\n- Handling both BSD and System V interfaces without prior knowledge of which is available\n- Efficiently removing multiple jobs without manual intervention\n- Using shell scripting techniques to parse and utilize command output\n- Providing a fallback method if the first attempt fails\n\nThe distractors represent common misconceptions or partial solutions:\nA) Mixes commands from both interfaces without proper fallbacks\nB) Assumes BSD interface and requires manual intervention for multiple jobs\nD) Uses incorrect or non-existent options, showing a misunderstanding of the available commands\n\nThis question goes beyond simple memorization, requiring analysis and application of the provided documentation in a complex scenario."}, "96": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/16", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/379790", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/64204/"], "docs_id": 379790, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We're running `InnoDB` as a MySQL engine and using phpMyadmin to administer our database.

Which of the following approaches would provide the most accurate and comprehensive data for tracking query performance trends over time?\n\nA) Implement a cron job that runs SHOW STATUS periodically and stores the results\nB) Use phpMyAdmin's built-in monitoring features to export statistics regularly\nC) Create a custom script that executes SHOW GLOBAL STATUS and stores the cumulative data\nD) Set up Munin to directly query the Innodb_rows_* variables from SHOW STATUS\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. SHOW GLOBAL STATUS provides cumulative statistics since the MySQL server was started, which is more suitable for long-term trend analysis than session-specific data.\n2. The documentation reveals that phpMyAdmin uses SHOW GLOBAL STATUS, explaining the discrepancy with the simple SHOW STATUS query, which only shows session-level data.\n3. A custom script allows for more flexibility in data collection and storage compared to phpMyAdmin's built-in features.\n4. While Munin is mentioned in the original question, directly querying SHOW STATUS would not capture the global statistics needed for accurate long-term monitoring.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses SHOW STATUS, which only provides session-level data that resets when connections terminate. Option B is misleading because while phpMyAdmin does use global status, it may not offer the flexibility and customization needed for a comprehensive monitoring solution. Option D is incorrect for the same reason as A, focusing on session-level data instead of cumulative statistics.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate information about MySQL status commands, understand the differences between global and session-level statistics, and apply this knowledge to a real-world scenario of implementing long-term database monitoring."}, "97": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/28", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/154757", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/55724/"], "docs_id": 154757, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am making a pretty standard PHP sign up form that will validate the data the user entered and then redirect to a page with a success message.

Because of this, you need to *first* store and *then* redirect. In fact, I recommend you make a habit of calling `exit` immediately after each redirect. There is no point in doing anything whatsoever in the current request once you've redirected (except cleanup, such as closing open file handles).\n\nThe reason you *don't* redirect in the error case is because nothing has been stored yet \\- if the user reloads, they'll just run into the same error again.

The optimal flow is to first validate the POST data (step 2), then pre-process it if necessary (step 3), store the data in the database (step 4), and only then redirect to a success page (step 5).

The redirect prevents accidental data duplication on page refresh.\n4. The success message is displayed after the redirect, confirming the operation's completion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it stores unvalidated data, which could lead to data integrity issues. Option B is flawed because it redirects before storing the data, which could result in data loss if there's an issue with the database operation.

In terms of particle interaction, is there a substantial 'size' difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The temptation is to think of a particle as a little ball whizzing around space, and it therefore makes sense to ask about the size and density of the ball. The trouble is that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a particle is.\n\nOur current best description of particles is using quantum field theory. This describes particles as excitations in quantum fields that pervade all of spacetime. You create a particle by adding energy to the quantum field, and a particle is destroyed by removing energy from the quantum field. Incidentally, this is how particles like the Higgs boson can be created in colliders \\- the energy of motion of the colliding particles is transferred into excitations of quantum fields where it appears as new particles.\n\nAnyhow, these excitations are delocalised and don't have a well defined position and size, so you can't ask *what is a neutrino's size* because the answer is that it doesn't have a size in the usual sense. You can try and confine a particle by interacting with it, and this gives you answers like *there is a 99% probability that the particle is within this cubic femtometre*. But this obviously isn't a *size* as we usually mean the word. A *size* would mean a minimum distance below which we can't confine the particle any further.\n\nTo confine the particle to smaller and smaller distances needs large and large energies. At the biggest energies we can create (in the LHC) fundamental particles like electrons still have no detectable size. Indeed in quantum field theory there is no minimum size \\- by making the energy arbitrarily high we can confine particles to arbitrarily small regions of space. String theory may change this if it turns out to be a useful description, but at present no\\-one knows for for sure if it is.\n\nSo the answer to your question is that it has no answer because particles don't have a size, and therefore don't have a density. Sorry!"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about neutrinos and photons, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is designing an experiment to detect both neutrinos and photons. Given the nature of these particles as described by quantum field theory, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the experimental design considerations?\n\nA) The detector for neutrinos should be significantly larger than the one for photons due to the neutrinos' larger \"size\"\nB) Both detectors should be designed with the same dimensions since neither particle has a defined size\nC) The photon detector should utilize materials with higher atomic numbers to increase interaction probability, while the neutrino detector should focus on large volumes of low-density materials\nD) The experiment should aim to measure the precise \"density\" of both particles to determine their relative sizes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that particles like neutrinos and photons don't have a conventional \"size\" or \"density\" as we typically understand these terms. This eliminates options A, B, and D which are based on misconceptions about particle size and density.\n\n2. While neither particle has a defined size, their interaction probabilities differ significantly. Photons interact electromagnetically and are more likely to interact with high atomic number materials (which have more electrons). \n\n3. Neutrinos, on the other hand, interact very weakly with matter. To detect them, experiments typically use large volumes of material to increase the chance of an interaction. Low-density materials are often used to allow neutrinos to penetrate deeply into the detector volume.\n\n4. Option C correctly captures these different design considerations based on the particles' interaction properties, not on misconceived notions of their \"size\" or \"density.\"\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the concept that particles are excitations in quantum fields, without defined sizes, to a practical scenario of detector design.

Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient and secure way to manage credentials for these various portals?\n\nA) Store usernames and passwords as environment variables and access them in the script\nB) Create and use named profiles for each portal, leveraging the .arcgisprofile configuration\nC) Implement a custom encryption method to store credentials in a local file\nD) Use a single GIS object with a superuser account that has access to all portals\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and secure approach is to use named profiles (option B). The documentation clearly states that \"Persisted profiles for the GIS can be created by giving the GIS authorization credentials and specifying a profile name.\" This method offers several advantages:\n\n1. Security: The profile stores credentials securely, with passwords managed by the operating system's keyring, which is more secure than storing them in plain text or using custom encryption.\n\n2. Efficiency: Once profiles are set up, they can be easily referenced in scripts without hardcoding credentials or implementing complex credential management.\n\n3. Flexibility: Different authentication methods (username/password, PKI, etc.) can be stored in separate profiles, allowing the script to easily switch between portals with different security setups.\n\n4. Maintenance: Updating credentials is easier as it's done in one place (the profile) rather than in multiple scripts.\n\nOption A (environment variables) is less secure and more cumbersome to manage across multiple systems. Option C (custom encryption) is unnecessary and potentially less secure than using the built-in profile system. Option D (single superuser account) is not a recommended practice for security reasons and doesn't address the need to connect to multiple portals with different authentication methods.\n\nThis question requires the candidate to understand the GIS class initialization options, security best practices, and the benefits of using profiles in the ArcGIS API for Python, demonstrating analysis and application of the documentation."}}
