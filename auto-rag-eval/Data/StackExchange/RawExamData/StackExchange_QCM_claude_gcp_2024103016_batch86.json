He arrives at the office building at 1:50 PM, goes through security, and reaches the interview room at 1:59 PM. Which phrase best describes John's arrival?\n\nA) In the nick of time\nB) On time\nC) In time\nD) With time to spare\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) \"In the nick of time\" implies cutting it extremely close, almost missing a deadline. While John arrived just before 2:00 PM, he wasn't in danger of being late, so this phrase is too extreme.\n\nB) \"On time\" suggests arriving exactly at the scheduled time. Since John reached the interview room at 1:59 PM, one minute before the scheduled time, this isn't the most accurate description.\n\nC) \"In time\" is the best answer. It indicates that John arrived before the deadline (2:00 PM) with sufficient time to be effective for the interview. This phrase allows for arriving a bit early, which John did.\n\nD) \"With time to spare\" implies having extra time, usually enough to do something else. While John arrived early, he only had one minute before the interview, which isn't enough time to engage in any other meaningful activity.\n\nThe correct answer is C) \"In time\" because it accurately describes John's arrival before the scheduled time, without implying an abundance of extra time or cutting it too close."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/23", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1371123", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1496025/"], "docs_id": 1371123, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: community,\n\ni get a **Galaxy Book Flex2** (NP930QCA\\-KA3DE) from work.

Remember that the rates for processes are computed by finding a so\\-called matrix element, and then integrating it over phase space. The allowed phase space here is of measure zero, because you have the additional constraint that the two final particles be exactly collinear.\n\nMore concretely, suppose we applied some regulator like a discrete lattice. Depending on how the regulator is set up, the rate for the process you cited may be nonzero, or exactly zero. But for a reasonable regulator, the rate should limit to zero as it is removed, by the argument above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A physics student proposes that a single photon could split into two photons based on conservation of momentum alone. Which of the following statements best describes the physical reality of this proposal?\n\nA) The student's proposal is correct, and photon splitting is a common occurrence in nature.\n\nB) The proposal violates conservation of momentum and is therefore impossible.\n\nC) While mathematically possible from a momentum conservation standpoint, the process has zero probability due to phase space constraints.\n\nD) Photon splitting is forbidden due to violation of conservation of angular momentum.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The student's proposal is mathematically consistent with conservation of momentum, as demonstrated by the example in the question. However, in reality, the process \u03b3 \u2192 2\u03b3 (one photon splitting into two) is effectively forbidden, not because it violates conservation of momentum, but because the available phase space for this process has zero volume.\n\nThe key point is that for this process to occur, the two resulting photons must be exactly collinear with the original photon. This constraint reduces the available phase space to a set of measure zero. In quantum field theory, the probability of a process is calculated by integrating over the available phase space. When this space has zero volume, the resulting probability is zero.\n\nOption A is incorrect because photon splitting is not common or even practically possible. Option B is incorrect because the process does not violate conservation of momentum. Option D is incorrect because while angular momentum conservation is important in particle physics, it's not the primary reason preventing photon splitting in this case."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/02/04", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/416249", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/10425/"], "docs_id": 416249, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are plenty of questions where people essentially want to know how to play their DVDs ([How can I play encrypted DVD movies?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/500/how-can-i-play-encrypted-dvd-movies), [Lord of the Rings](https://askubuntu.com/q/339330/10425), [Toy Story](https://askubuntu.com/q/278916/10425), [another one](https://askubuntu.com/questions/113043/how-can-i-watch-dvd-movies-using-ubuntu-for-the-first-time)).\n\nIs there any way to know before you buy a DVD to know if it runs on your system?\n\nObviously, simply looking at the DVD does not help:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/h9vwx.jpg)\n\nIs there any online service or another way to get to know if you can watch a DVD on your computer before buying it?\n\nedit: Sometimes, Amazon customers give this information if it is not working.

The documentation indicates that batteries are consumable with a finite lifetime, designed for about 1000 full discharge and charge cycles. Using high-performance settings that engage the powerful GPU will cause the battery to \"blaze through power at the high consumption rate.\" This accelerated usage will likely cause the battery to reach its 1000-cycle limit much faster than the typical 3-4 year lifespan, potentially necessitating a replacement within 1-2 years.

This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized EMR wave propagating from left to right (X axis). The electric field is in a vertical plane (Z axis) and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane (Y axis).

The default setting below is set to 8 hours (I know I wrote 4 hours in the image on accident). I increased mine to a year and implemented a process to make sure orders don't get that old. We use the \"Pending Payment\" to mark orders that are shipped but not paid yet, and the clients are usually given 30\\-60 days to pay.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eRvSL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eRvSL.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Magento store is experiencing issues with orders being unexpectedly cancelled overnight. Upon investigation, it's discovered that these are Pending Payment orders. What configuration change would most effectively address this issue while allowing for extended payment terms of 30-60 days?\n\nA) Decrease the \"Pending Payment Order Lifetime\" setting to 4 hours\nB) Increase the \"Pending Payment Order Lifetime\" setting to 1 year\nC) Remove the \"Pending Payment\" status entirely from the order workflow\nD) Implement a daily cron job to manually review and extend Pending Payment orders\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B - Increase the \"Pending Payment Order Lifetime\" setting to 1 year. \n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem described in the image. By default, Magento cancels Pending Payment orders after 8 hours. For businesses that use the Pending Payment status for orders that are shipped but not yet paid, with payment terms of 30-60 days, this default setting is far too short. \n\nIncreasing the lifetime to 1 year prevents premature cancellation of these orders, allowing ample time for payment to be received within the extended terms. This approach also aligns with the solution implemented by the user in the image.\n\nOption A would exacerbate the problem by cancelling orders even sooner. \nOption C is too extreme and would disrupt the normal order workflow. \nOption D, while potentially workable, introduces unnecessary complexity and manual intervention when a simple configuration change can solve the issue."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/05", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260074", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/252153/"], "docs_id": 260074, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is an extract of paragraph 2 of section 1 of the [Stack Exchange Terms of Service](https://stackexchange.com/legal):\n\n> ...Subscriber also certifies that they are legally permitted to use the Services and access the Network, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Network.

In Linux, threads have a different process ID to the other threads in the process. When you look at the PID column in `ps`, you're actually looking at the thread group ID (TGID), which is common amongst all threads in a process. This is for historical reasons due to the way threads evolved in Linux.\n\nFor example, on my system, chromium has a number of threads in a process (multiple processes too):\n\n```\n$ ps -efL | grep chromium\n[UID       PID  PPID   LWP  C NLWP STIME TTY          TIME CMD]\n[...]\ncamh     10927  5182 10927  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10929  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10930  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10933  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\n\n```\n\nThe second column is the TGID (although it is labelled as PID) and the forth column is LWP (light\\-weight process).\n\n```\n$ ls /proc | grep 10927\n10927\n$ ls /proc | grep 10929\n$ cd /proc/10929\n$ head -n 5 status\nName:   Chrome_ChildIOT\nState:  S (sleeping)\nTgid:   10927\nPid:    10929\nPPid:   5182\n\n```\n\nYou can see that process 10929 does not show up in `/proc`, but you can `cd` to it. If you look in the `status` file, you'll see that it is part of \"process\" (thread group) 10927, and from the output above, that process does appear in `/proc`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In Linux, what does the LWP column represent when using the command 'ps -efL', and how does it relate to the process ID (PID) shown in /proc?\n\nA) LWP stands for \"Lightweight Process\" and represents individual threads within a process. These may not appear as separate entries in /proc.\n\nB) LWP stands for \"Linux Working Process\" and is always identical to the PID shown in /proc.\n\nC) LWP stands for \"Linked Worker Process\" and represents child processes that are directly linked to the parent in /proc.\n\nD) LWP stands for \"Low-priority Waiting Process\" and shows processes that are waiting for CPU time, which are not listed in /proc.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: LWP stands for \"Lightweight Process\" and represents individual threads within a process. In Linux, threads within the same process share the same thread group ID (TGID), which is displayed as the PID in most process listings. However, each thread has its own unique LWP number.\n\nThese individual threads (LWPs) may not appear as separate entries when listing the contents of /proc, but you can still access their information by using their LWP number as if it were a PID (e.g., /proc/[LWP]). This is why in the example, thread 10929 doesn't show up when listing /proc, but you can still cd into /proc/10929.\n\nThe status file within each thread's /proc entry will show both the thread's individual PID (which matches its LWP) and the TGID of the process it belongs to. This design reflects the evolution of thread implementation in Linux and maintains compatibility with older systems while supporting multi-threaded processes."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/03", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/536577", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/211604/"], "docs_id": 536577, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Using the moderncv \\+ biblatex, I created the list of publications with label prefix and index number.\nFor a specific index, I would like to include an image/icon at the bottom of the label index as shown below:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4oX9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4oX9.png)\n\nI was wondering if there is any way or reference to generate such customized Biblatex styles?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your bibliography items are very short, an icon placed below the label number may clash with the label number of the next item.

README simply is a starting point. Explain where to find the installation documentation. Explain where to find developer documentation. Usage documentation. Changelogs. README should be a signpost: the one place you can look to be directed to where you really need to go.\n* Many pieces of software have HTML READMEs with navigation and such, often included with the software or source code. This is good because formatting and hyperlinks are more useful than plain text. Your simple README text file might direct someone toward a more expressive document.\n* Perhaps have links to GitHub or wherever the software lives, which generally also has more documentation as well. GitHub documentation is more closely tied to the structure of the code, since its markdown files live in source folders. This would be a great place to put developer documentation.\n* Whatever the documentation, have links to documents for \"I just want to install, what do I do?\" and \"how to compile from scratch on supported platforms.\"\n* Finally, developer documentation is well\\-placed in Doxygen, JavaDoc, or GitHub documentats. These are standard documentation formats that developers are expected to know how to build and read. Being more technical users, developers require less hand\\-holding. Provide a makefile, Ant script, or Visual Studio solution, and they should be able to figure it out.\n\nAs Robert Harvey alluded to in his comment, there is no standard thing to do.

Visitors are linked to the correct subfolder path initially\n2. Visitors are served a landing page from which they select their store and receive a cookie\n3. Some mechanism is used to set the run type and run code prior to PHP handling the response\n\nRegarding \\#3: since 1\\.4 Magento, made it possible to allow the Web server to determine the running context (**website** or **store**) as well as the particular code which should be used.

With Apache and `mod_rewrite` this can be done for subfolders with a bit of trickery:\n\n```\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/de/$\nRewriteRule .* - [E=MAGE_RUN_CODE:deutsch]\nRewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_MAGE_RUN_CODE} (.+)\nRewriteRule .* - [E=MAGE_RUN_CODE:%1]\n\n```\n\nApache is twitchy with environment variables and subfolders, as demonstrated by [this excellent SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10128290/833795). The initial two lines result in `$_SERVER[\"REDIRECT_MAGE_RUN_CODE\"] = 'deutsch';` while the latter two lines provide the needed `$_SERVER[\"MAGE_RUN_CODE\"] = 'deutsch';`. There are numerous other tricks, but the above has bitten me before.\n\n***The end goal should be initial detection as much as is reasonable (geoip \\+ multi\\-language concerns) while getting the user to set the store cookie which can be used to bypass/step through the logic in subsequent requests.***"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Magento-based e-commerce site needs to serve multiple domains and languages using different store views.

Some factors come into play:\n\n1. I run into a coding problem that requires research time, which adds a couple of time to my specified deadline.\n2. There are times when my internet is down for half a day or even a whole day.\n3. There are some inquiries left unanswered (via email)\n\nand many other factors. I was wondering how I can specify deadlines which will take into consideration any unexpected factors that might delay it or something like that, which of course, will not put a frown into my clients' face, hehe.\n\nBy the way, a client asked me to develop a site from scratch using Django in which I have not much experience of. He knew that and he consented to me doing some research while in development. I said I would finish the project in about 3 weeks yet I did not expect Django to be such a massive nerve\\-wracking framework, my internet was down during some days, and I only worked less than 10 hours on the holy week.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking you have two choices (and can take an intermediate position between them.)\n\nOne is to accept a \"hard\" deadline. If you do this I would always add a very large fudge factor. Unless the job is simple and you have done something almost exactly like it before you should estimate at least 3x what you think it should take, at first, if the deadline *must* be met. Maybe more. As you gain experience you might find that you can drop that a bit but the fudge factor should always be there. If you do this you will have to be quite rigid about not accepting changes without extending the deadline.\n\nAnother option is to be very honest with your client. The truth is that software estimates are very difficult to make accurately. So you can simply say \"I believe it will be X days before this is done. But I could be wrong. It might take significantly longer than that. And if you want changes as the work goes on it will make the whole thing take longer.\" Then you can work with them in terms of schedule. Even then you should apply a fudge factor but it can be smaller, since you have not absolutely promised to finish by a certain date.\n\nI'd also say that having your internet down/computer problems/etc. is not a very good excuse in most cases. You are a professional, so you are responsible for making sure you have internet access, and making sure you have a backup plan (I've done client work on a laptop at an internet cafe before, and I remember once seeing a developer pay someone $200\\.00 USD to use their internet connection overnight in order to respond to a client emergency when they were too far from home to get back in a timely enough manner.)\n\nI've done some very rush jobs, with hard deadlines in the past. I always charged a lot for it because it often meant days with little to no sleep. That can be lucrative, but it's not something I want to do very much, so when I freelance I tend to be generous with my time estimates, and leave myself some leeway.

This aligns with the advice in the documentation to \"be very honest with your client\" and explain that software estimates are difficult to make accurately. It's important to communicate that the timeline could be affected by various factors, including unexpected technical challenges or requested changes.

This hierarchical relationship accurately represents the scope of these concepts. Deep Learning is a specific approach within the broader field of Machine Learning, which uses multi-layered neural networks to learn from data. Machine Learning, in turn, is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating systems that can learn and improve from experience. Artificial Intelligence is the overarching field that aims to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking and behavior.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationships shown in the diagram.

Of course, this means I need to use a water valve and a MOSFET to control it. The MOSFET feeds power from a 9V battery to the solenoid, and a Huzzah ESP8266 (on a separate 9V battery) controls the MOSFET gate.\n\nI found that the ESP8266 would not open or close the valve, so I started testing the valve and I realized that I could not open the valve at all. The valve is a plastic 12V solenoid valve (<https://www.adafruit.com/product/997>), but the information on that page indicates that it can be run using 9V. As far as the 3 PSI minimum pressure requirement goes, the valve is connected to a resevoir that is 3\\-4 feet above the valve, so I figure that I have a decent amount of pressure from gravity.\n\nI have almost no idea what could be going wrong \\- I connected the 9V battery directly to the solenoid through a breadboard and nothing happened.

For example, my e\\-book reader use an unpartitioned space to store uboot, kernel and other data.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general it is not safe. The FS assumes that operations are written in certain order so it can write new data of file and then make a pointer to it from other data, the exact details depend on filesystem. Imagine if following happens:\n\n1. `dd` reads from location X which contains garbage or some data\n2. Filesystem writes to location X\n3. Filesystem writes to location X\\+1 pointer to location X\n4. `dd` reads from location X\\+1 link to location X\n\nFrom the point of view of backup you get a garbage data. However there are several ways to workaround it:\n\n* Freeze filesystem by filesystem specific command (I believe `xfs_freeze` is one and I don't know any other \\- but such option exists at least in theory)\n* Create a lvm snapshot and copy from it. The copy will be as\\-if you rebooted the computer (minus the HDD reordering) so it will be a dirty filesystem but the copy will be atomic. Note that some filesystems like XFS needs to be frozen first.\n* Use rsync as suggested by others. Now the copy is safe and you don't need LVM but the copy is not atomic. So while it avoids the above problem on filesystem level it might still run into problems with files (rather unlikely but one can imagine missing files while mv is executed in background for example)\n* Use filesystem with snapshoting such as [btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/), [tux3](http://www.tux3.org/), [zfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS), [nilfs](http://nilfs.sourceforge.net/en/)... Then you avoid both problems \\- you can just create a snapshot and copy from it by rsync having full atomicity. Note however that such filesystem often tend to be experimental.\n\nAs a last note \\- `dd` might not be a best way of backup. It copies a full disk which is often wasteful as you copy the 'garbage' as well. If you need to have a disk images something like [partimage](http://www.partimage.org/Main_Page) might be better. If you don't a better option is using either using a rsync, tar in differential/incremental mode etc. or a full backup system such as [bacula](http://blog.bacula.org/), [tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/index.html) or one of many others.

If you go on to become a grad student you're going to learn all this material eventually anyway, and as you know more math you can learn more math quickly. So the reason to take one class instead of another class is because it has a teacher who you learn well from!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is the most important factor an undergraduate student should consider when choosing math courses?\n\nA) The breadth of topics covered in the course\nB) The level of difficulty of the course material\nC) The reputation of the professor teaching the course\nD) The relevance of the course to future graduate studies\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer emphasizes that students should \"choose classes based on who is teaching them.\" The response suggests that the quality of the instructor is the most crucial factor, as a good teacher can enhance the learning experience regardless of the specific content. The answer implies that students will eventually learn all the necessary material in graduate school, so the primary consideration should be finding professors \"who you learn well from.\" This aligns most closely with option C, which focuses on the reputation and teaching ability of the professor.\n\nOption A is not the best choice because the answer doesn't prioritize breadth of topics.

increase the element's height, potentially causing layout issues.\nOption B (margin-bottom) could affect the layout of surrounding elements.\nOption D (bottom) would move the entire element, not just

I've created a workaround solution which involves creating a new template in the following location:\n\n> httpdocs \\> app \\> design \\> frontend \\> ThemeVendor \\> ThemeName \\>\n>  Magento\\_Checkout \\> web \\> template \\> shipping\\-information \\>\n>  address\\-renderer \\> default.html\n\nand commenting out the custom attributes section of the template \n\n```\n<if args=\"visible()\">\n    <text args=\"address().prefix\"/> <text args=\"address().firstname\"/> <text args=\"address().middlename\"/>\n    <text args=\"address().lastname\"/> <text args=\"address().suffix\"/><br/>\n    <text args=\"_.values(address().street).join(', ')\"/><br/>\n    <text args=\"address().city \"/>, <span text=\"address().region\"></span> <text args=\"address().postcode\"/><br/>\n    <text args=\"getCountryName(address().countryId)\"/><br/>\n    <a if=\"address().telephone\" attr=\"'href': 'tel:' + address().telephone\" text=\"address().telephone\"></a><br/>\n<!-- \n    <each args=\"data: address().customAttributes, as: 'element'\">\n        <text args=\"$parent.getCustomAttributeLabel(element)\"/>\n        <br/>\n    </each>\n-->\n</if>\n\n```\n\nObviously this isn't ideal but at least it makes the website workable while I look for a better solution.\n\n**Edit 17 March 2020 \\- SOLUTION**\n\nWith thanks to [Simon](https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/142/simon) this now seems to be resolved. I used trial and error on my development site.\n\nGoing into the database table `eav_attribute` and removing the following two values seems to have fixed the error: \n\n```\nID - 175 -  validation_status \nID - 257  - email\n\n```\n\nI'm not sure what validation status is and email seems to be a duplicate value. Regardless removing these two rows from the database table seems to have resolved the error. \n\nI have now implemented this on our live site.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For this kind of issue, it's really hard to find the root cause.

Set breakpoints in relevant code\n2. Inspect JavaScript objects and variables at runtime\n3. Step through code execution\n4. View the full call stack\n\nThe other options are more like workarounds (B), potentially risky database modifications (A), or general update procedures (D) that don't directly address root cause analysis.

Well, I can use redstone engines but they're slow. Is there a better way without using Forestry \\- I want not to have to install new mods.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Redstone engines certainly start slow but they increase significantly in speed the longer they are allowed to run. You can also use energy links to power steam engines and combustion engines \\- I did a quick test in creative, and even while still cooled down these will transfer a minimum of half a stack in one go. Warmed up they'll do a full stack at a time. \n\nIf you need speed more than volume you could add some gold pipe to your system. You can power gold pipe with a redstone torch and it will significantly increase the speed of the items that go through it for 16 blocks. In creative I tried a golden pipe after a transfer pipe powered by a steam engine, an energy link, and a a batbox; and I was really pleased with the results. \n\nEDIT: the tekkit wiki says that the boost lasts twice as long if you use stone pipe as opposed to cobble.\n\nUPDATE: Be cautious with the kind of power you supply an engine. It'll explode if you give it too much, and it'll overload if it runs too long. Redstone engines won't blow as long as something is running through the tube, so either be content with low volume and high speed, or increase the volume as discussed above but remember to shut your engines off every so often and let things cool.\n\nFinally you could try using pneumatic tubes with accelerators and magtubes. I haven't ever done much with these as they use redpower's blutricity, and at this point I don't think there's a mod that will transfer IC2 or BC power to blutricity. I've been tempted to start messing with them though because these tubes will only send items if there's a vacant space to put them; therefore they don't spit overflow out into the world if the target chest or machine is full."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Minecraft modpack using IndustrialCraft 2 and BuildCraft, which combination of methods would be most effective for increasing item transfer speed and volume without installing new mods?\n\nA) Using only redstone engines and cobblestone pipes\nB) Combining energy links with steam engines and gold pipes\nC) Using pneumatic tubes with accelerators and magtubes\nD) Powering combustion engines directly with MFE energy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because while redstone engines can be used, they are slow, especially initially.\nB) is correct because it combines several effective methods mentioned in the answer. Energy links can power steam engines, which transfer larger volumes. Gold pipes increase speed for 16 blocks, and using stone pipes instead of cobble extends this to 32 blocks.\nC) is incorrect because pneumatic tubes use blutricity from RedPower, which can't be directly powered by IC2 or BuildCraft energy without additional mods.\nD) is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as connecting MFEs directly to combustion engines could cause explosions due to power overload.\n\nThe correct answer provides a balance of speed and volume while staying within the constraints of the existing mod setup."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/04", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/139255", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/42297/"], "docs_id": 139255, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I refer [Magento 2 \\- Export/Import Product Attributes](https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/104399/magento-2-export-import-product-attributes) but no one answered :(\n\nI have already created new Attribute Set \\& it's Attributes.

It doesn't make sense.\n2. The factory that should instantiate the object will throw a \"circular dependency\" exception.\n\nI'll start with the second point.  \n\nIf you do it like that, when you try to instantiate your helper, the dependency injection container (DIC) will look for an instance of your class to pass it to your class constructor.  \n\nBut that class instance does not exist, so DIC will try to instantiate it and you are back at the previous step. \n\nAnd here is why it doesn't make sense.  \n\nYou would need a dependency on your class because you need to call a method from that dependency, but you can already call methods from your class inside your class. You don't need an other instance to call methods from that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 2 development, why is it not possible to have a class depend on itself in its constructor?\n\nA) It would cause a memory leak in the Magento framework\nB) It violates Magento's coding standards and best practices\nC) It would result in a circular dependency exception when instantiating the object\nD) It would conflict with Magento's attribute management system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Magento 2, having a class depend on itself in its constructor would result in a circular dependency exception. When the Dependency Injection Container (DIC) tries to instantiate the object, it would enter an infinite loop trying to create an instance of the class to pass to its own constructor.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while poor design could lead to memory issues, a self-dependency specifically doesn't cause a memory leak.\n\nAnswer B, although it might be considered a poor practice, is not the primary reason why this is not possible. Magento's coding standards don't explicitly forbid this.\n\nAnswer D is unrelated to the question. The attribute management system in Magento is not directly connected to how class dependencies are handled.\n\nThe key point is that circular dependencies in constructor injection lead to unresolvable situations for the Dependency Injection Container, making it impossible to instantiate the object."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/12", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/505826", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/250324/"], "docs_id": 505826, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using ansible in a vagrant environment managing a debian box.

By using Ansible's feature to call a script that returns the vault password, and storing this password in memory rather than on disk, you reduce the risk of the password being recovered from temporary files or persisting after a VM reboot. \n\nOption A is the current approach mentioned in the question, which has security risks if an attacker gains access to the VM or if a provisioner fails, leaving the temporary file on the system.\n\nOption C, using an environment variable, could potentially expose the password to other processes and might persist longer than necessary.\n\nOption D, hard-coding the password, is a significant security risk and violates best practices for handling sensitive data.\n\nThe memory-based approach (B) aligns with the user's suggestion of using memory to improve security, making it more difficult for an attacker to recover the password compared to file-based methods."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/12", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/48745", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/20958/"], "docs_id": 48745, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: IR point thermometers have come down a lot in price.

It can capture thermal images of large wall sections at once, providing a comprehensive view of insulation performance.

Responses suggesting *service* are appropriate, if they come from a representative of a business or organisation to a private citizen. They are not a good choice in the other direction. Between private citizens, they used to be much more common, when one might ask for the other\u2019s hospitality. But that is rare these days.\n\nA less formal **\u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d** is perhaps the only response of this sort that I would think is still typical. It implies that the speaker is ready and willing to have some of their time taken up by this unexpected enquiry.\n\n**\u201cCan I help you?\u201d** is also an option, but I find that outside of a business context, it often has a negative connotation: \u201cyou clearly have a problem\u201d, or even \u201cyou\u2019re causing *me* problems, so I\u2019ll \u2018help\u2019 you to go away\u201d. (Within a business context, it\u2019s generally fine: you can suggest that customers have a problem, *if* it\u2019s the sort of problem you\u2019re in business to solve!)\n\nPoliteness in English often takes the form of being indirect. Many questions can be made (more) polite by *asking if you can ask*. So instead of \u201cwhat is this about?\u201d (direct; not actually rude, but not trying to be polite either), you can say **\u201ccan I ask what this is about?\u201d** (\u201cMay\u201d instead of \u201ccan\u201d is slightly more formal.)\n\nIf the situation is very informal, a typical response would be to simply invite them to talk: **\u201cYes?\u201d** or **\u201cgo ahead.\u201d** (\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d falls into this category too, but is probably friendlier than you want to be with a stranger.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A stranger approaches you with a generic greeting like \"Hi!\" without specifying their purpose.

It's polite, indirect, and allows the other person to explain their purpose without assuming anything.

Using \\usepackage{globalcommands} will solve the issue.\n\nB) Commands defined in tcolorbox listings are always global by default. No resolution is needed.\n\nC) Commands are defined locally within each listing. To make them available globally, use \\xdef or \\global\\def instead of \\NewDocumentCommand.\n\nD) The issue can be resolved by adding the 'global' option to the tcolorbox listing environment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In LaTeX, commands defined within environments (including tcolorbox listings) are typically local to that environment. This means they're not accessible outside of it, including in subsequent listings. To make a command available globally, you need to use a global definition method. The documentation suggests using \\xdef for simple commands or \\global\\def for more complex ones. While \\NewDocumentCommand is a powerful way to define commands, it creates local definitions by default. The other options are either incorrect (A and B) or not a standard feature of tcolorbox (D). It's important to note that while making commands global can solve the immediate problem, it should be done cautiously as it can lead to unexpected behavior in larger documents."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/15", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/19992044", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1589336/"], "docs_id": 19992044, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sorry for the noob question but i am at this for several hours now.\n\nI am trying to create a unordered list that the `<li>` floating left. and the window's width is set.\n\nThe issue is when there is too many `<li>` it wont add scrolling instead it will put the `<li>` that dont fit in another line\n\nhere is an example:\n\n```\n<ul id=\"someUL\">\n    <li> whatever </li>\n    <li> whatever </li>\n    <li> whatever </li>\n</ul>\n\n```\n\nWell actually better show on fiddle.\n\nHere is an example of what i mean in <http://jsfiddle.net/eSckg/1/>\n\nMy question how do i go about doing that ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You don't say which version of Tomcat you are using so I am going to assume 7\\.0\\.x You need to add the following to your HTTPS connector in server.xml\n\n```\nSSLVerifyClient=\"none\"\n\n```\n\nDetails of this, all all the other SSL configuration options are in the docs:\n[http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat\\-7\\.0\\-doc/config/http.html\\#SSL\\_Support\\_\\-\\_APR/Native](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html#SSL_Support_-_APR/Native)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is configuring an HTTPS connector in Tomcat's server.xml file and wants to disable client certificate authentication.

It also mentions that little effort should be needed to enhance Photon to provide a location bias, which aligns with the developer's goal of implementing autocomplete with a bounding box parameter.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that search-as-you-type is not possible in Nominatim by design, and modifying it would require significant effort.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because Nominatim is described as not performing well for typeahead functionality and is designed for exact matches, not partial queries.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Photon is mentioned as a fast solution, it's noted that it doesn't include a bounding box parameter by default.
