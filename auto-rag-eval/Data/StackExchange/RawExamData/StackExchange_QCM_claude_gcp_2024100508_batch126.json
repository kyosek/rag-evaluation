Is the expansion of the universe creates acceleration?

So we gain speed without feeling any acceleration. If one of the twin in the twin paradox would use such a machine to gain speed; what would happen?\n\nI don't have a physics or math background, and I hope my question makes sense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Marco Ocram's answer is essentially correct; I just wanted to give the formula, and back up with some data:\n\nTime runs slower in distant galaxies by a factor $(1\\+z)$, where $z$ is the observed redshift of the galaxy. This is a prediction of general relativity, and is observationally verified. That is,\n$$\n\\\\Delta t\\_\\\\mathrm{here} \\= (1\\+z) \\\\Delta t\\_\\\\mathrm{there}.\n$$\n\nThis time dilation applies to all physical processes. The figure below (from [Goldhaber et al. 2001](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...558..359G/abstract)) shows how the width supernova lightcurves \u2014 i.e. how fast the luminosity increases and decreases \u2014 increases as a function of redshift. That is, the more distant the supernova is, the slower it evolves.\n\nThe effect is symmetric; an observer in a distant galaxy would see *us* redshifted, and hence time dilated, by the same factor that we see *them* redshifted.\n\n[![SN](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EAJ6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EAJ6.png)\n\nThe redshift is what is observed. To relate that to a distance, one needs a cosmological model. In the standard, flat \"[FLRW cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric)\", the distance to a galaxy of redshift $z$ is\n$$\nd \\= \\\\frac{c}{H\\_0} \\\\int\\_0^z \\\\frac{dz'}{\\\\sqrt{\n\\\\Omega\\_\\\\mathrm{m}(1\\+z)^3 \\+ \n\\\\Omega\\_\\\\Lambda }},\n$$\nwhere $c$ and $H\\_0$ are the speed of light and Hubble constant, respectively, and $\\\\Omega\\_\\\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\\\Omega\\_\\\\Lambda$ are the relative densities of matter and dark energy, respectively.\n\nIn the figure below, I plotted the time dilation factor as a function of distance from us. A secondary $x$ axis on top of the plot shows the corresponding lookback time, i.e. how long time ago we see the galaxy; as we approach 13\\.8 billion light\\-years \u2014 the age of the Universe \u2014 time dilation diverges toward infinity.

For z = 1.5, we calculate:\n\n1 + z = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5\n\nThis means that for every 1 unit of time that passes in the distant galaxy, 2.5 units of time pass on Earth.

The test is about the neurons, not about the monkeys. And the neurons are different ones (I'm taking a neurology course, so just believe me :\\-) ).\n\nNow, I'm not certain that a paired test may not be justified in the end, but I'm quite certain the justification above is completely bogus.

I feel as before: The paired test may be justified, but I'd say that for how this is used as a test in stats courses its use IMHO is at the very least not the best choice, at least if the question is as above and the reasoning as quoted.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue is that CP levels naturally vary across individuals. Some individuals will tend to have high CP levels and some will tend to have low CP levels.\n\nThis will tend to make a pair of CP measurements from the same individual more similar than the corresponding measurements from two different individuals would be.\n\nThis dependence between measurements on an individual is what makes them paired measurements.\n\nThis is different from \"everything happens in the same universe\" because \"being in the same universe\" would not tend make one pair of measurements more alike than another. \n\n\\-\\-\n\nEssentially the same reasoning (though less clearly explained) is in the answer you quoted.

Which of the following actions would be the MOST appropriate and code-compliant solution?\n\nA) Replace the 14/2 wire with 12/2 wire and keep the 20 amp breaker and receptacle\nB) Keep the 14/2 wire, but replace the 20 amp breaker with a 15 amp breaker and the 20 amp receptacle with a 15 amp receptacle\nC) Replace the 14/2 wire with 12/2 wire and downgrade the breaker and receptacle to 15 amp\nD) Keep everything as is, since the lights only draw 8.8 watts\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate and code-compliant solution is to keep the 14/2 wire but replace the 20 amp breaker with a 15 amp breaker and the 20 amp receptacle with a 15 amp receptacle. This is because breakers are sized according to the smallest wire gauge in the circuit. Since 14/2 wire was added, the maximum allowed breaker size is 15 amps. Changing the receptacle to match the new breaker size is also necessary. This solution ensures safety without requiring the more extensive work of rewiring. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't address the mismatch between wire gauge and breaker size. Option C is unnecessary since the 14/2 wire is sufficient for a 15 amp circuit. Option D is unsafe as it leaves an improperly sized breaker for the wire gauge used."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/05", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/591857", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 591857, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: By work\\-energy theorem: total work done on a mass equals the total change in kinetic energy.

The work you do accelerates the object giving it kinetic energy.\n\nAn example where the change in kinetic energy is zero is when you push an object with constant velocity on a surface with friction. The positive work you do when pushing the object a distance $d$ equals the negative work done by kinetic friction over the same distance $d$, for a change in kinetic energy of zero. The negative friction work takes the energy you gave to the object and dissipates it as heat at the contacting surfaces.\n\nHope this helps."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A block of mass m is initially at rest on a rough horizontal surface.

Some examples:\n\n* Applying the accelerator in a motor vehicle where the tires aren't touching the ground can damage the vehicle (transmission?), because torque that is intended to move the vehicle is far too excessive when the tires have no resistance.\n* \"Dry firing\" a spring\\-powered weapon such as an airsoft gun or foam\\-dart blaster with no ammunition loaded can damage the firing mechanism, which is designed to transfer the spring force into a projectile. The same applies to releasing a bowstring with no arrow nocked.\n\nModern devices may have mechanisms to avoid damage in these circumstances; for example, a modern car may disengage the drive train if it detects that a tire is spinning freely with no contact to the ground; power tools may include a belt to provide resistance when the tool is not in contact with anything.\n\nFor an upright floor vacuum, normal use of the vacuum would involve pushing it across the floor; regardless of the type of floor, there should be some air resistance from the floor. However, if we lift the vacuum while it is operating (for example, to carry it over an obstacle or across the room) there will be much less air resistance while the vacuum isn't in contact with the floor. Will this damage the vacuum over time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Less air resistance will not damage your vacuum.  \n\nSucking while on a floor (hardwood or maybe concrete) will not create that much of a drop in air resistance to even cause the pump to change its suction power. Therefore, it's okay.\n\nOn the other side, restricting the airflow, such as reducing the intake, or even restricting it entirely, will cause issues with the pump. Majority of the products will be able to determine some issues, such as overheating, and shut off themselves until optimal conditions, temperature, are reached.  \n\nI have noticed this feature even in a very cheap vacuum that got clogged.\n\nIn addition, I have used vacuums (that were intended for floors) to suck in dust or smoke for long periods of time.

However, restricting airflow by clogging or reducing the intake can cause issues with the pump and potentially lead to overheating. Many vacuums have safety features to shut off when overheating occurs, but this is more likely to happen due to restricted airflow than from operating with less resistance.

Consequently, their envelopes are very large and intersects a lot, which makes spatial indexes based on features' envelopes not so efficient.\n\nI suspect tilemill retrieves all contour lines intersecting a given tile to render them. The memory overflow is certainly a consequence of the fact that too many contour lines are intersecting some tiles.\n\nMy advice:\n\n1. Test what happens when the contours are cut into smaller pieces (with smaller envelopes). You could use the [ST\\_Split](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Split.html) function. The spatial indexes should become far more efficient then. Hopefully.\n2. For each zoom level, choose a contour interval so that only few relevant contour lines are selected and rendered.

Cutting contour lines into smaller pieces using ST_Split will make spatial indexes more efficient by reducing the size of feature envelopes. Adjusting the contour interval based on zoom level will reduce the number of lines rendered at each zoom, decreasing memory usage and improving performance. \n\nOption A might help temporarily but doesn't address the underlying inefficiencies.

That name resolution is working fine because curl reports that it cannot reach network 2800:3f0:4001:806::1005; this shows that the name translation did succeed. This is different than an error in name lookup:\n\n```\n $ curl -6 http://does.not.exist.foo.\n curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'does.not.exist.foo.'\n\n```\n\nIn order to reach an IPv6 address, you need to have a route to the destination address and very few connections have any IPv6 connectivity at all.

I know how to get to anywhere that I don't have an explicit route to by handing the packet to my default router at 192\\.168\\.1\\.1\\.\n\nYour name resolution is working just fine.

This is evidenced by several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The error message \"Failed to connect to 2800:3f0:4001:806::1005: Network is unreachable\" indicates that DNS resolution is working (as it successfully resolved the IPv6 address), but the network cannot be reached.\n\n2. The documentation explicitly states: \"It is not a problem with resolving IPv6 addresses. That name resolution is working fine because curl reports that it cannot reach network 2800:3f0:4001:806::1005\".\n\n3. The answer explains that to reach an IPv6 address, you need to have a route to the destination address, and very few connections have IPv6 connectivity.\n\n4. The example provided shows a system with almost no IPv6 routes, contrasting it with the IPv4 routing table which includes a default gateway.\n\nWhile the Ubuntu version might play a role (option D), it's not the primary cause. DNS resolution (option A) is working correctly. The curl command configuration (option B) is not the issue, as the problem persists even when explicitly using the -6 flag.

However, the syntax of the functions is very close to the C\\+\\+ API and therefore rather difficult. For raster data there is the wrapper [rasterio](https://pypi.org/project/rasterio/). For vector data there is the wrapper [fiona](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/). The [documentation](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#rules-of-thumb) describes for which cases `fiona` is suitable.\n\nYou can also access `ogr2ogr` from the command line inside Python. To simplify this, you can use the script `ogr2ogr.py` ([link](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/swig/python/samples/ogr2ogr.py)).

It provides a more Pythonic and user-friendly interface compared to the raw GDAL bindings, making it easier to read, write, and manipulate vector data formats like shapefiles.\n\nA is incorrect because while GDAL provides low-level control, its API is close to C++ and can be difficult to use directly in Python for this task.\n\nC is incorrect because Rasterio is primarily designed for working with raster data, not vector data like contour lines and polygons.\n\nD is not the best choice for this specific task.

So in the case above, the null check is useless. Either `p` is allocated, or an exception will be thrown causing the property setter to be skipped.\n\nI have asked my coworker about this in passing, and I get a passive answer along the lines of \"just in case\". I don't like this kind of \"paronia\\-programming\" myself. I think it hurts the readability and needlessly increases cyclomatic complexity. Because of this, I would like to make a formal request that this practice be stopped. Is this a reasonable request? Am I missing something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I agree with @MartinMaat about picking your battles.\n\nThere are many cases of \"just in case\" due to not really understanding the language despite the language being fixed in its rules for many of these things \\-\\- over parenthesizing an expression that doesn't need it due to not understanding the precedence rules of the language. But still, such practice is mostly harmless.\n\nWhen I was younger, I felt that we should learn the details of the language and thus avoid writing such superfluous code.\u00a0 (One of my pet\\-peeves was `return (0);` with its unnecessary parens.)\u00a0 However, I now moderate that position, in particular, because we use so many different languages now, jumping from client to server, etc... So, I now cut some slack for some such issues.\n\nYou're point about cyclomatic starts to go to logically reasoned argument.\u00a0 Let's look at [Code Coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage#Coverage_criteria) and especially [higher levels of coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage):\n\n> > 2. Each decision takes every possible outcome\n\nSince we cannot force the new operation to return NULL, ***there's no way to reach higher levels of code coverage for this conditional operation.***\u00a0 Of course, this may or may not be important to your organization!\n\nHowever, because of this code coverage issue I would prioritize it higher than than over\\-parenthesizing.\n\nOn the other hand, the underlying generated code will probably not suffer one bit for this as the code generations, JIT, and optimizers all understand that a `new`ed value will never be null.\u00a0 So, the real cost comes only in terms of readability and source code coverage capabilities.\n\nI would ask you what does the \"else\\-part\" of such an if statement look like? \n\nIf there is no else\\-part, I would argue that simply falling off the end of the routine or falling through to other code (i.e. no `else` for this `if`) is potentially dangerous, since now this \"just in case\" logically suggests that callers and/or further code down the line handles NULL as well.\n\nIf it reads:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p != null ) {\n    p.field = value;\n}\nelse {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\n\n```\n\nthen this is really overkill, as the language does all of that for us.\n\nI might suggest reversing the sense of the conditional \u2014 perhaps your colleague will be more comfortable with this:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p == null ) {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\nelse {\n    p.field = value;\n}\n\n```\n\nNow you can argue for the removal of the else wrapper, since it is very clearly unnecessary:\n\n```\np = new Object ();\nif ( p == null ) {\n    throw new NullReferenceException ();\n}\np.field = value;\n\n```\n\nWith this, the \"just in case\" is now what is conditional, whereas the succeeding code isn't.\u00a0 This approach further reinforces that when allocation fails, the appropriate response is throwing, rather than continuing to run code in this method and/or in this call chain (without any other proper handling of the allocation failure).\n\nSo, in summary there are two logically reasoned arguments to make here against this practice:\n\n1. Higher code coverage levels cannot be reached as we cannot force out of memory (or any constructor failure) to return null.\n2. The \"just in case\" (as shown above in the question) is incomplete ***and as such is flawed*** because of the inconsistency in expectations of how null were to be handled by other code beyond/past the `p.field = value;`.\n\nFundamentally, it seems like perhaps your colleague is on the fence about using exceptions \u2014 even though there's no choice here in C\\# for such things.\u00a0 (*If we want well\\-tested code* we cannot code for both an exception model for handling null and a non\\-exception model using null\\-return\\-values, side\\-by\\-side.)\u00a0 Perhaps if you reason with your colleague through these topics, they'll see some light!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is reviewing code and encounters the following pattern frequently:\n\n```\nPerson p = new Person();\nif (p != null)\n{\n    p.Name = \"John Smith\";\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the most compelling argument for removing this null check?\n\nA) It improves performance by reducing unnecessary conditional checks.\n\nB) It's impossible to achieve higher levels of code coverage with this pattern.\n\nC) The compiler will automatically optimize this code, so it doesn't matter.\n\nD) It makes the code more readable by removing redundant checks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While all options have some merit, option B presents the strongest argument based on the documentation.

What advantage would using a prototype bring about over subclassing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Why is subclassing too much bad**\n\n\"Too much\" is a judgement call; but take it from me it is bad. The code I work with has DEEP inheritance and the code is just damn hard to read, understand, follow, trace, debug, etc. etc. It is effectively impossible to write test code for this stuff.\n\n**Prototype pattern does away with subclassing**\n\nOr does the question mean \"does away with too much subclassing?\". This pattern calls for cloning a \"template\" object to avoid subclassing, at least at that point. There's no rule that says the \"template\" can't be a subclass.\n\n**Favor composition over inheritance**\n\nThis idea here also includes delegation and aggregation. Following this heuristic means **your software tends to be more flexible, easier to maintain, extend, and reuse.**\n\nWhen a class is composed of parts **you can substitute those parts at runtime**. This has a profound effect on testability.\n\n**Testing is easier**. You can use fake parts (i.e. \"mocks\", \"doubles\" and other testing\\-talk). Our code's deep inheritance means we must instantiate the entire hierarchy to test any bit of it. In our case that is not possible without running the code in it's real environment. For example we need a database in order to instantiate business objects.\n\n**Changes come with side effects and uncertainty** \\- The more \"base\" the class the more widespread the effects, for good or bad.

The standard conjectures for a given Weil cohomology theory over $k$ imply that one can modify the tensor structure on $M(k)$ and turn it into a tannakian category. This also implies the standard conjectures are true for any other Weil cohomology: any such cohomology will define a fiber functor of $M(k)$ and thus will be isomorphic to the fiber functor defined by the original Weil cohomology, at least after a change scalar to a bigger field of coefficients.\n\nNow, if a field $k$ is a filtered union of subfields $k\\_i$, such that, for each $i$, there is a Weil cohomology over $k\\_i$ for which the standard conjectures hold, then the category $M(k)$ is the filtered 2\\-colimit of the tannakian categories $M(k\\_i)$: this comes from the fact this is true for the version of motives where the Hom's are Chow groups up to rational equivalence, and from the preceding discussion. This implies that $M(k)$ is tannakian itself and that any Weil cohomology on $k$ defines a fiber functor on $M(k)$, from which one can deduce the standard conjectures for any Weil cohomology on $k$ rather formally."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the standard conjectures, Weil cohomology theories, and fields of characteristic 0?\n\nA) The standard conjectures are only valid for singular cohomology over the complex numbers.\n\nB) Proving the standard conjectures for any Weil cohomology over a field k is sufficient to prove them for all Weil cohomologies over k.\n\nC) The standard conjectures must be proven separately for each Weil cohomology theory and each field of characteristic 0.\n\nD) Proving the standard conjectures for an arbitrary Weil cohomology over each subfield of finite type of k is sufficient to prove them for any Weil cohomology over k.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The key principle is that proving the standard conjectures for an arbitrary Weil cohomology over each subfield of finite type of a field k is sufficient to establish them for any Weil cohomology over k. This is because:\n\n1. The category of pure motives M(k) can be turned into a tannakian category if the standard conjectures hold for a given Weil cohomology over k.\n2. Any Weil cohomology will then define a fiber functor of M(k), making it isomorphic to the fiber functor defined by the original Weil cohomology (after possibly extending the coefficient field).\n3. For a field k that is a filtered union of subfields k_i, if the standard conjectures hold for some Weil cohomology over each k_i, then M(k) becomes the filtered 2-colimit of the tannakian categories M(k_i).\n4. This implies M(k) is itself tannakian, and any Weil cohomology on k defines a fiber functor on M(k), from which the standard conjectures can be deduced for any Weil cohomology on k.\n\nThis approach is more general and powerful than the other options, as it allows for the extension of the standard conjectures to a broader range of fields and cohomology theories."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/12", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/157397", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/13374/"], "docs_id": 157397, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $f \\\\in L^1(\\\\mathbb{R})$, for $a\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ let $f\\_a(x)\\=f(x\\-a)$, prove that:\n$$\\\\lim\\_{a\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\\\|f\\_a \\-f \\\\\\|\\_1\\=0$$\n\nI know that there exists $g\\\\in C(\\\\mathbb{R})$ s.t $\\\\\\|f\\-g\\\\\\|\\_1 \\\\leq \\\\epsilon$, this is also true for $f\\_a$ and $g\\_a$.\n\nNow I have the next estimation:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\n\\\\\\|f\\_a\\-f\\\\\\|\\_1 \\&\\= \\\\int\\_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\|f(x)\\-f(x\\-a)\\| dx \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\int \\|f(x)\\-g(x)\\+g(x)\\-g(x\\-a)\\+g(x\\-a)\\-f(x\\-a)\\| \\\\\\\\\n\\&\\\\leq \\\\\\|f\\-g\\\\\\|\\_1 \\+ \\\\\\|f\\_a\\-g\\_a\\\\\\|\\_1 \\+ \\\\int \\|g(x)\\-g(x\\-a)\\|\n\\\\end{align\\*}\nmy question is: I can argue that $\\\\lim\\_{a\\\\to0} \\\\int \\|g(x)\\-g(x\\-a)\\| \\= \\\\lim\\_{a\\\\to0} \\\\lim\\_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\|g(x\\_0\\)\\-g(x\\_0\\-a)\\| 2T$, now I think that I can change the order of the limits here, but I am not sure why?\n\nP.s\n$x\\_0$ is some point in $\\[\\-T,T]$, and the above is valid from the intermediate integral theorem for continuous functions, right?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you need to do is to be a little more picky in your choices.

Now as a minimum you have to define:\\-\n\n* What data you are trying to protect?\n* Who are you trying to protect that data from?\n* Who *actually* needs access to what (and when)?\n* What is the legal/financial/business impact of that data being compromised?\n* What is the legal/financial/business need for a person/group having access to the data?\n* What budget is the business willing to assign to a \"get secure, stay secure\" strategy when it was not a business requirement previously?\n* What access does the system need to the data?\n* What does this process and systems this application rely on?\n* What is done to secure those environments?\n* Who is going to be responsible for implementing it and reviewing the whole process?\n\nUntil you know all those in detail you really don't have anything to work with. That information will define what mitigations to those threats you can (and cannot) apply and why. \n\nIt may be that the best thing to do is recognise that you don't have the necessary experience and that it would be best to bring in someone new with that experience.

Developers have SSH access to the machine for maintenance and releases. Recently, highly sensitive data started being stored in the application, raising security concerns. As a security professional tasked with securing this data, which of the following is the MOST comprehensive first step to address this situation?\n\nA) Immediately revoke all SSH access for developers to prevent data breaches\nB) Encrypt all data in MySQL and MongoDB databases\nC) Implement a thorough security assessment process, including defining what data needs protection, who needs access, and the potential impact of data compromise\nD) Move all sensitive data to a separate, air-gapped system that developers cannot access\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most comprehensive first step is to conduct a thorough security assessment (option C). This approach aligns with the principle that security should be built-in from the beginning and not treated as an afterthought. It involves understanding the full scope of the problem, including what data needs protection, who needs access, and the potential impacts of a breach. This process allows for a more holistic and effective security strategy.\n\nOption A (revoking SSH access) is too drastic and may hinder legitimate work. Option B (encryption) is a good security measure but shouldn't be implemented without first understanding the full security landscape. Option D (air-gapped system) might be excessive and impractical without first assessing the actual needs and risks.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach to security, considering all aspects of the system and its use, rather than implementing a quick fix that might not address the root of the problem."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/04/27", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/252338", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1601703/"], "docs_id": 252338, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **I received the first downvote for that question several seconds after publication.

The Peltier I am using is the TES1\\-12706 or TEC1\\-12706 (12v 60Watt)\n\nThank you so much, I mainly want to see if you guys think this would work, or I need to get a lower powered Peltier to be on the safe side, also I want you guys to tell me if that Ohm's Law conversion is correct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a much more [readable datasheet](http://www.thermonamic.com/TEC1-12706-English.pdf) for the TEC1\\-12706\n\nWhat can be easily said is that you **are unlikely to be able to** run both the Peltier and a fan on a power supply that can only deliver 2\\.4 A. This will depend on how accurately the battery pack shuts off on overcurrent of course, but assuming it's accurately measuring the current it won't work. \nYou need a power supply that will deliver at least 3 A if you don't want to regulate the voltage going to the Peltier. \n\nThe effective resistance of the Peltier module depends on temperature (both absolute and differential). The Peltier effective resistance for this module has a positive temperature coefficient, as the absolute temperature goes up, so does the effective resistance. The datasheet shows performance data using a constant current with variable voltage with the Hot side at a specified temperature.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkoL4.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkoL4.png)\n\nYou are wanting to feed the module with a constant 5 V ...so I marked it on the performance curve.\n\nThis graph shows T(hot) as 27 degC and we can consider this to be ambient temperature for this exercise. \n\nNow consider the points I marked:\n\n1. When you first turn the unit on there is no temperature difference between the hot side and the cold side, both are at 27 DegC (a balmy 80 Deg F). From the graph we can derive that you may draw about 2\\.5 Amps (halfway between the green and purple line). The effective resistance is about 2 Ohms.\n2. At point 2, as the temperature on the cold side is reduced by 20 degC (and assuming our fan on the hot side keeps it at ambient, 27 DegC), the cold side temperature is about 7 DegC ...this is 20 DegC less than the hot side. The current at this point is about 2 Amps. The effective resistance about 2\\.5 Ohms.\n3. At point 3, the cold side is at about \\-3 DegC (30 DegC less than the hot side). The current is about 1\\.8 Amps. The effective resistance about 2\\.8 Ohms.\n\nFrom the above you can see that the effective resistance varies with temperature, and how great a differential temperature can be maintained depends on the thermal losses in your mechanical design.\n\nIt's unlikely that you will be able to maintain the hot side at 27 DegC. If the ambient temperature varies and the hot side temperature varies then you have to work out what the effective resistance might be from the curves given.\n\nNotice in the datasheet that it shows a separate performance curve where the hot side is at 50 DegC (about as hot as the hand can tolerate). Notice also that the current flows have gone down (with a constant 5 V input) compared to those at 27 DegC. \n\nThe bad news is that as the ambient temperature drops to say 15\\.5 DegC (60 F) you can expect the current when you first turn the unit on (hot \\= cold side temp) to be MORE than at 27 DegC. Projecting the data given, I'd expect the turn on current to be very close to 3 A @ 15\\.5 DegC (60 DegF) ambient.\n\nThe only really viable solution is to measure the current and adjust the voltage to hold the current maxima at your desired level. \n\nDatasheets for modules\n\nThermonamic have a full set of [datasheets](http://www.thermonamic.com/pro_view.asp?id=806) and the TEC1\\-12704 does seem closer to a reasonable choice for you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a portable cooling system using a Peltier element (TEC1-12706) and a small fan, powered by a 5V, 2.4A max output battery pack. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the feasibility and performance of this setup?\n\nA) The system will work as intended, with the Peltier element drawing 2.1A and the fan drawing 0.4A, totaling 2.5A which is within the battery pack's capacity.\n\nB) The system will not work reliably because the initial current draw of the Peltier element at room temperature (27\u00b0C) could be as high as 2.5A, leaving insufficient current for the fan.\n\nC) The system will work, but the cooling performance will be optimal, as the Peltier element will maintain a constant current draw of 2.1A throughout its operation.\n\nD) The system is likely to fail because the current draw at lower ambient temperatures (e.g., 15.5\u00b0C) could exceed 3A, surpassing the battery pack's maximum output.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The answer is D because the documentation highlights several key points:\n\n1. The current draw of the Peltier element varies with temperature and is not constant.\n2. At room temperature (27\u00b0C), the initial current draw could be about 2.5A, which is already at the limit of the battery pack's capacity.\n3. As the ambient temperature decreases, the initial current draw increases. The documentation suggests that at 15.5\u00b0C, the initial current could approach 3A.\n4. The battery pack's maximum output is only 2.4A, which is insufficient for the potential current demands of the system, especially at lower ambient temperatures.\n5.

In terms of, how does this reflect on my original data from the regression?\n\nI'm totally stumped, thanks guys\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Linear regression in fact models the conditional expected values of your outcome. That means: if you knew the true values of the regression parameters (say $\\\\beta\\_0$ and $\\\\beta\\_1$), given a value of your predictor X, filling that out in the equation\n$$\nE\\[Y\\|X] \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X\n$$\nwill have you calculate the expected value for $Y$ over all (possible) observations that have this given value for $X$.\n\nHowever: you don't really expect any single $Y$ value for that given $X$ value to be exactly equal to the (conditional) mean. Not because your model is wrong, but because there are some effects you have not accounted for (e.g. measuring error). So these $Y$ values for a given $X$ values will fluctuate around the mean value (i.e. geometrically: around the point of the regression line for that $X$).\n\nThe normality assumption, now, says that the difference between the $Y$s and their matching $E\\[Y\\|X]$ follows a normal distribution with mean zero. This means, if you have an $X$ value, then you can sample a $Y$ value by first calculating $\\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 X$ (i.e. again $E\\[Y\\|X]$, the point on the regression line), next sampling $\\\\epsilon$ from that normal distribution and adding them:\n$$\nY'\\=E\\[Y\\|X] \\+ \\\\epsilon\n$$\n\nIn short: this normal distribution represents the variability in your outcome *on top of* the variability explained by the model.\n\nNote: in most datasets, you don't have multiple $Y$ values for any given $X$ (unless your predictor set is categorical), but this normality goes for the whole population, not just the observations in your dataset.\n\nNote: I've done the reasoning for linear regression with one predictor, but the same goes for more: just replace \"line\" with \"hyperplane\" in the above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducts a linear regression analysis and finds that the residuals are normally distributed.

This means that for any given X value, the actual Y values are scattered around the regression line (E[Y|X]) in a normal distribution pattern. \n\nOption A correctly captures this concept, stating that the dependent variable Y is normally distributed around the regression line for each X value.

The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials says that we can write any symmetric polynomial of the roots of a polynomial as a polynomial of its coefficients.

Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not a reference, but a short proof.\n\nWe use the following (probably known, but see later) lemma on representing a symmetric tensor as a linear combination of rank\\-1 symmetric tensors.\n\n**Lemma.** Let $A$ be a finite set, $K$ an infinite field. Denote by $\\\\mathcal S$ the set of symmetric functions $p:A^n\\\\to K$. Then $\\\\mathcal S$ is the $K$\\-span of rank\\-one functions, that is, the functions of the type $h(x\\_1\\)h(x\\_2\\)\\\\ldots h(x\\_n)$, where $h:A\\\\to K$.\n\n**Proof.** Note that the product of two rank\\-one functions is a rank\\-one function. Thus the linear space $\\\\mathcal T$, generated by rank\\-one functions, coincides with the $K$\\-algebra generated by them.\n\nWe may suppose that $A\\\\subset K$. For $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$ denote $e\\_k(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n)$ the elementary symmetric polynomial, that is, $\\\\varphi\\_t(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n):\\=\\\\prod(1\\+tx\\_i)\\=\\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^n t^ke\\_k$. We identify $e\\_k$ and the corresponding element of $\\\\mathcal S$. Choosing $n\\+1$ distinct values $t\\_1,\\\\ldots,t\\_{n\\+1}\\\\in K$ and solving the corresponding (Vandermonde's) linear system of equations we represent each $e\\_k$ as a linear combinations of $\\\\varphi\\_{t\\_i}\\\\in \\\\mathcal T$. Thus $e\\_k\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ for all $k\\=0,1,\\\\ldots,n$. It is well known that $e\\_k$'s generate the algebra of symmetric polynomials (over any field). Thus any symmetric polynomial function belongs to $\\\\mathcal T$. It remains to note that any symmetric function $f\\\\in \\\\mathcal S$ may be represented by a symmetric polynomial. Indeed, a symmetric function $f$ may be represented as $F(e\\_1,e\\_2,\\\\ldots,e\\_n)$ for certain function function $F$ defined on the corresponding finite set (because the values of $e\\_1,\\\\ldots,e\\_n$ determine the values of $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n$ up to permutation). $F$ in turn coincides with a polynomial function on this finite set. $\\\\square$\n\nNow we may prove your theorem for finitely supported function $i\\\\mapsto p\\_i$. Due to Lemma it may be supposed to have the form $p\\_i\\=\\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^n H(i\\_k)$ for a certain finitely supported function $H$ on $\\\\mathbb{N}$ (as OP, I denote here $\\\\mathbb{N}\\=\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots\\\\}$). In this case both parts of your identity are equal to $\\\\det (\\\\sum\\_m H(m)A^m)$.\n\n**Comment.** Lemma does not hold for finite fields. For example, if $A\\=K\\=\\\\{0,1\\\\}$. Then the function $x\\+y\\+z$ is not a linear combination of rank\\-one functions 1, $xyz$, $(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$: if $x\\+y\\+z\\=a\\+bxyz\\+c(x\\+1\\)(y\\+1\\)(z\\+1\\)$, then for $y\\=0,z\\=1,x\\=a$ we get $0\\=1$. I must make a warning that in the subject\\-related paper \"Symmetric tensors and symmetric tensor rank\" by Pierre Comon, Gene Golub, Lek\\-Heng Lim, Bernard Mourrain (SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 2008, 30 (3\\), pp.1254\\-1279\\) this statement, after equation (1\\.1\\), is stated for any field, although proved for complex numbers, and the proof uses that a non\\-zero polynomial has non\\-zero values.\n\nIn any case, you may always enlarge the ground field and safely think that it is infinite."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider an n \u00d7 n matrix A with eigenvalues a\u2081, ..., a\u2099. Which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between symmetric polynomials of eigenvalues and polynomials of matrix entries?\n\nA) The sum of any symmetric polynomial of eigenvalues can always be expressed as the sum of determinants of matrices formed by columns of powers of A, regardless of the ground field.\n\nB) The identity \u2211\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u207f p\u1d62a\u2081\u2071\u00b9...a\u2099\u2071\u207f = \u2211\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u207f p\u1d62 det(A\u2081\u2071\u00b9, ..., A\u2099\u2071\u207f) holds only when the ground field is infinite.\n\nC) The proof of the identity relies on the fact that every symmetric function can be represented as a linear combination of rank-one functions over any field, finite or infinite.\n\nD) The identity can be generalized to several commuting matrices without any additional constraints on the underlying field.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The identity relating symmetric polynomials of eigenvalues to polynomials of matrix entries holds when the ground field is infinite. The proof relies on a lemma stating that symmetric functions can be represented as linear combinations of rank-one functions, which is true for infinite fields but not necessarily for finite fields. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the statement doesn't hold for all fields, particularly finite fields. \n\nOption C is false because the representation of symmetric functions as linear combinations of rank-one functions is not valid for all fields, specifically not for finite fields.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the identity can be generalized to commuting matrices, the constraint on the field being infinite still applies.\n\nThe key insight is that the underlying field needs to be infinite for the identity to hold, which is captured in answer B."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/817750", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/21005/"], "docs_id": 817750, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I made a boot/installation media of Mythbuntu 16\\.04 by mkusb 10\\.6\\.6\\.
