How far is my formula correct and reflects my aims?\n2. Is it true that Rasch Model should be more useful for my data?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you would neeed to provide more details in your question to enable us to provide a more suitable answer. In the meantime, please see below.\n\nThe formula for your potential model mod1 suggests that you are treating **Group** as a random grouping factor. But **Group** has only 3 levels \\- Control, View, No View \\- and those levels are likely the only ones you are interested in. In other words, you are *not* considering that these levels are representative of a larger set of levels \\- you just care about the 3 concrete levels Control, View and No View. This suggests that you should allow **Group** to appear in the fixed effects portion of your model, not in the random effects portion. In particular, this implies that you shouldn't have terms like (Time\\|Group) or (Time\\|Group:Subject) in your model. \n\nUnlike **Group**, **Subject** and **Item** are genuine random grouping factors in that:\n\n* The subjects you included in your study are representative of a larger set of subjects to which you wish to generalize the study findings;\n* The items you included in your study are representative of a larger set of items to which you wish to generalize the study findings.\n\nIdeally, the subjects included in the study would have been selected at random from the larger set of subjects and the items included in the study would have been selected at random from the larger set of items. This would ensure their representativeness. \n\nFrom the diagram you provided, it seems that your two random grouping factors, **Subject** and **Item** are *fully crossed* (?). If this is indeed the case, *each subject* included in the study is exposed to *each of the items* included in the study, so it would make sense to allow for terms such as (...\\|Subject) and (...\\|Item) in your model formula. \n\nAs an aside, other possibility in terms of study design would be that *each subject* included in the study is exposed to *some but not all of the items* included in the study \\- with some overlap between subjects in terms of the items they are exposed to, in which case **Subject** and **Item** would be *partially crossed*. Yet another possibility would be that *each subject* is exposed to totally different items compared to all other subjects (so that **Item** is nested within **Subject**). Let's ignore these possibilities for now, as they don't seem to match your own study design. \n\nThe part that is not clear from your question is what exactly was measured for each subject by item combination in your study? Specifically, how often was your **Response** measured for each subject by item combination? \n\nWere your subjects allocated to one of 3 different groups \\- Control, View or No View \\- and then exposed in turns to each of the items included in the study? Was their **Response** assessed both *before* the exposure (Pretest) and *after* the exposure (Postest)? In that situation, it makes sense to allow the effect of **Time** to vary at random across subjects and items but not the effect of **Group**. So your preliminary model could be something like:\n\n```\nmod1 <- glmer(Response ~ Time*Group +\n                         (Time|Subject) +\n                         (Time|Item), \n              data = vocabDat, \n              family = 'binomial')\n\n```\n\nJust like Andre, I can't comment on the Rasch Model as I am not familiar with it.\n\nAddendum:\n\nLet's say your study design is much simpler (you only have one item) and your model is much simpler: \n\n```\nmod1 <- glmer(Response ~ Time*Group + (1|Subject),\n              data = vocabDat, \n              family = 'binomial')\n\n```\n\nThe model equation would be:\n\n```\nLOi = (beta0 + S0i) + beta1*TimeDummy + \n     beta2*ViewDummy+ beta3*NoViewDummy + \n     beta4*TimeDummy*ViewDummy+ beta5*TimeDummy*NoViewDummy\n\n```\n\nwhere \n\n* LOi \\= log odds of correct response on sole item for i\\-th subject;\n* S0i is a random intercept (aka random subject effect);\n* TimeDummy equals 1 when Time \\= Posttest and 0 when Time \\= Pretest;\n* ViewDummy equals 1 when Group \\= View and 0 else;\n* NoViewDummy equals 1 when Group \\= NoView and 0 else.\n\nThis model will ultimately enable you to compare the odds of a correct response between posttest and pretest, separately for each group, while allowing for subject\\-to\\-subject variability in responses. \n\nNow, if you revert back to your own design and account for item\\-to\\-item variability as well, a simplified model may be:\n\nmod1 \\<\\- glmer(Response \\~ Time\\*Group \\+ (1\\|Subject) \\+ (1\\|Item), \n data \\= vocabDat, \n family \\= 'binomial')\n\nand its equation would look like:\n\nLOij \\= (beta0 \\+ S0i \\+ I0i) \\+ beta1\\*TimeDummy \\+ \n beta2\\*ViewDummy\\+ beta3\\*NoViewDummy \\+ \n beta4\\*TimeDummy\\*ViewDummy\\+ beta5\\*TimeDummy\\*NoViewDummy\n\nwhere:\n\n* LOij \\= log odds of correct response for i\\-th subject on j\\-th item;\n* I0i is a random intercept (aka random item effect);\n* all else is as above.\n\nSo this last model will also enable you to model the change in odds of a correct response between postest and pretest, separately for each group, after taking into account subject\\-to\\-subject and item\\-to\\-item variability in responses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a vocabulary study examining the effect of different learning conditions (Control, View, NoView) on student performance over time (Pretest, Posttest), which of the following mixed-effects logistic regression models would be most appropriate for analyzing the dichotomous (correct/incorrect) responses across 20 vocabulary items?\n\nA) glmer(Response ~ Time*Group + (Time|Group:Subject) + (Time|Group) + (Time|Subject) + (Time|Word), data=vocabDat, family='binomial')\n\nB) glmer(Response ~ Time*Group + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), data=vocabDat, family='binomial')\n\nC) glmer(Response ~ Time*Group + (Time|Subject) + (Time|Word), data=vocabDat, family='binomial')\n\nD) glmer(Response ~ Time + Group + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), data=vocabDat, family='binomial')\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most appropriate model for this study design. Here's why:\n\n1. It includes the fixed effects of Time and Group, as well as their interaction (Time*Group), which allows for testing the main effects and how the effect of time might differ across groups.\n\n2. It treats Subject and Word (item) as random effects, which is correct since these are likely representative of larger populations.\n\n3. It allows the effect of Time to vary randomly across both Subjects and Words (items), which accounts for individual differences in how subjects might change over time and how items might behave differently over time.\n\n4.

Without a minimal working example, it's difficult to say for certain, but if you're using `\\include` then it may be possible that you're using a command like `\\includeonly` to only selectively include chapters. If the excluded files contain commands like `\\gls` they'll be skipped when the file is skipped, which means that they won't be written to the glossary file and no glossary will appear.\n\nHere's an example. The main file `test.tex`:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{report}\n\n\\usepackage{glossaries}\n\n\\makeglossaries\n\n\\loadglsentries{example-glossaries-brief}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch1}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch2}\n\n\\include{chapters/test-ch3}\n\n\\printglossaries\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nIn the `chapters` directory (folder) the files are:\n\n`test-ch1.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{Sample}\n\n\\gls{lorem}\n\n```\n\n`test-ch2.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{Another}\n\n\\gls{dolor}\n\n```\n\n`test-ch3.tex`:\n\n```\n\\chapter{No Glossary Entries Here}\n\n```\n\nNow the following document build sequence:\n\n```\npdflatex test\nmakeglossaries test\npdflatex test\n\n```\n\nwill correctly generate the glossary. However, suppose I now add\n\n```\n\\includeonly{chapters/test-ch3}\n\n```\n\nto the preamble. This excludes the two chapters that use `\\gls` and only includes the chapter that doesn't contain any `\\gls` (or similar) command. This means that nothing is written to the glossary. Now recompile (rebuild) the document:\n\n```\npdflatex test\nmakeglossaries test\n\n```\n\nThis produces an error message from `makeglossaries`:\n\n```\nmakeglossaries version 2.15 (2014-07-30)\nadded glossary type 'main' (glg,gls,glo)\nWarning: File 'test.glo' is empty.\nHave you used any entries defined in glossary 'main'?\nRemember to use package option 'nomain' if you\ndon't want to use the main glossary.\n\n```\n\nThis is because nothing has been written to `test.glo` because all the commands that perform that write have been skipped.\n\nWhat should you do? Well, if you're excluding chapters, that means you're still working on the document, in which case it doesn't matter. The document is already an incomplete draft since there are some chapters missing, so just skip the `makeglossaries` step until you're ready to check the entire document rather than just the particular chapter you're working on. Once you go back to including the files that contain glossary references, then go back to building the glossary.\n\n**Edit:** Another possibility is that you may be using an old version of `makeglossaries` which didn't pick up `\\@input` from the `.aux` file.

Two I have come across are K\\-fold and Monte Carlo cross\\-validation techniques. I have read that K\\-fold is a variation on Monte Carlo but I'm not sure I fully understand what makes up the definition of Monte Carlo. Could someone please explain the distinction between these two methods?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $k$\\-Fold Cross Validation\n--------------------------\n\nSuppose you have 100 data points. For $k$\\-fold cross validation, these 100 points are divided into $k$ equal sized and mutually\\-exclusive 'folds'. For $k$\\=10, you might assign points 1\\-10 to fold \\#1, 11\\-20 to fold \\#2, and so on, finishing by assigning points 91\\-100 to fold \\#10\\. Next, we select one fold to act as the test set, and use the remaining $k\\-1$ folds to form the training data. For the first run, you might use points 1\\-10 as the test set and 11\\-100 as the training set. The next run would then use points 11\\-20 as the test set and train on points 1\\-10 plus 21\\-100, and so forth, until each fold is used once as the test set.\n\nMonte\\-Carlo Cross Validation\n-----------------------------\n\nMonte Carlo works somewhat differently. You randomly select (without replacement) some fraction of your data to form the training set, and then assign the rest of the points to the test set. This process is then repeated multiple times, generating (at random) new training and test partitions each time. For example, suppose you chose to use 10% of your data as test data. Then your test set on rep \\#1 might be points 64, **90**, 63, **42**, 65, 49, 10, 64, 96, and 48\\. On the next run, your test set might be **90**, 60, 23, 67, 16, 78, **42**, 17, 73, and 26\\. Since the partitions are done independently for each run, the same point can appear in the test set multiple times, *which is the major difference between Monte Carlo and cross validation*.\n\nComparison\n----------\n\nEach method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Under cross validation, each point gets tested exactly once, which seems fair. However, cross\\-validation only explores a few of the possible ways that your data could have been partitioned. Monte Carlo lets you explore somewhat more possible partitions, though you're unlikely to get all of them\\-\\-there are $\\\\binom{100}{50} \\\\approx 10^{28}$ possible ways to 50/50 split a 100 data point set(!). \n\nIf you're attempting to do inference (i.e., statistically compare two algorithms), averaging the results of a $k$\\-fold cross validation run gets you a (nearly) unbiased estimate of the algorithm's performance, but with high variance (as you'd expect from having only 5 or 10 data points). Since you can, in principle, run it for as long as you want/can afford, Monte Carlo cross validation can give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.\n\nSome approaches fuse the two, as in the 5x2 cross validation (see [Dietterich (1998\\)](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089976698300017197) for the idea, though I think there have been some further improvements since then), or by correcting for the bias (e.g., [Nadeau and Bengio, 2003](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/pub_subject/finance/pointeurs/techrep.pdf))."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing k-fold cross-validation with Monte Carlo cross-validation for a dataset of 100 points.

Your base data is using NAD 1983 State Plane North Dakota North zone, in US survey feet. The sp1 file for the GPS data says that it's using NAD 1927 State Plane North Dakota North zone, in meters. It's unusual to have NAD 1927 State Plane coordinates in meters. Here's what I think is happening. Between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983, the projection parameters are the same except:\n\nNAD 1927\nfalse easting: 2000000 US ft \\= 609601\\.2192 m\n\nNAD 1983\nfalse easting: 1968500\\.0 US ft \\= 600000 m\n\nIf the GPS data is really NAD 1927, but you defined it as NAD 1983 (both units matching), the one layer would be offset around 9\\.6km or 31500 ft east\\-west. There could be an additional 20\\-200 m offset due to the mistaken datum. \n\nIf that's what you're seeing, even though the sp1 file says meters, the data may be in feet. \n\nSolution is to try to define the GPS data as the coordinate system that the sp1 file says. If it's really NAD 1927 ND North, in meters, you'll have to modify the existing NAD 1927 ND North definition."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS specialist is having trouble aligning shapefile data from a client with existing base data. The base data uses NAD 1983 State Plane North Dakota North zone in US survey feet. The client's data, according to the sp1 file, uses NAD 1927 State Plane North Dakota North zone in meters. The specialist notices that the client's data is consistently offset to the east. What is the most likely cause of this misalignment?\n\nA) The client's data is actually in NAD 1983 but was mislabeled in the sp1 file\nB) The false easting values differ between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983, causing an east-west offset\nC) The client's data is in a completely different coordinate system not mentioned in the sp1 file\nD) The base map is incorrectly projected, causing all new data to appear offset\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause is the difference in false easting values between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983 coordinate systems. NAD 1927 has a false easting of 2,000,000 US ft (609,601.2192 m), while NAD 1983 has a false easting of 1,968,500.0 US ft (600,000 m). This difference would cause an east-west offset of about 9.6 km or 31,500 ft if the data is incorrectly defined as NAD 1983 instead of NAD 1927. The consistent eastward offset mentioned in the question aligns with this explanation. Additionally, there may be a units mismatch (feet vs meters) contributing to the problem, but the primary issue stems from the difference in false easting values between the two coordinate systems."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/13", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/297142", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/360951/"], "docs_id": 297142, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new to Stack Overflow, and currently have 1 rep status (at the moment, I just posted three answers there).\n\nA few minutes back, the reputation section in my profile summary showed that I was awarded 10 reputation in relation to [this post answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44516947/how-to-read-relevant-information-from-maven-dependency-tree-using-regex-in-perl/44523920#44523920).

It just so happened that you were online to notice the immediate notification, but lost the reputation, again, when the user retracted their vote.\n\nIt is worth noting that this does not necessarily mean the user changed their mind, regarding the vote. The window to retract a vote without further edits to a question is rather small. As such, it is more likely that the initial vote was made *in error*, and the user noticed in time to correct said error. This sometimes happens to me, especially when I aim to check a questions total score, by clicking on the number in the middle of upvote and downvote buttons1.\n\nWhen a vote is thus retracted so shortly after being cast, the vote and its retraction do not appear in the user's reputation history for technical reasons (to avoid users filling each other's histories with meaningless vote/unvote events), and that is why you could not find any history about it.\n\nAs pointed out, this is the general Meta site for all of Stack Exchange, and [any registered user can post with only 1 reputation](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-posts). As you have noted, the reputation requirement pertains to *specific* site\\-metas (e.g. [Meta Stack Overflow](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/), which you are indeed still restricted from accessing.\n\n1 At a higher reputation, you can view the \"total score\", which displays total downvotes and total upvotes.

This explains the temporary increase in reputation to 10 (from an upvote), followed by a return to 1 rep when the vote was retracted. The documentation mentions that when a vote is retracted shortly after being cast, it doesn't appear in the user's reputation history for technical reasons. This also explains the temporary granting of new privileges (which are reputation-based) and the subsequent removal of those privileges when the reputation dropped back to 1. The green bar indicating positive reputation change and its disappearance also align with this explanation. Option A is incorrect because an accepted answer would grant 15 rep, not 10.

Until now, in this situations, I always did empirical tries in order to understand what's the correct ratio between power\\-on time and current. **Is there any general rule that allows you to calculate the right current starting from the power\\-on time and vice versa in order to obtain a good brightness?** Or is the empirical method the only way?\n\nOn the Internet I see that, in multiplexing, some people don't use resistors for the LEDs saying that if you **turn on the LED without any current limitation for a very low time** it will not damage. Obviously in this case the LED is very bright but is this technique completly safe for the LED or **affects its lifetime?** In the case where there is a **safe time** for which the LED can be turned on without current limitation, which is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Turning on the LED with no resistor does not mean there is no current limiting. It just means that current is limited by:\n\n* internal resistance and inductance of the LED\n* the same of your driving circuitry\n* your power supply's ability to supply current\n\nIf your power supply is a couple of AA batteries, then it probably can't supply much current. If your power supply is a 12V automotive lead acid battery, your LED will probably be reduced to cloud of metal and plastic vapor before you even realize what's happened.\n\nDetermining the current and duty cycle can be done by a rough rule of thumb: brightness is proportional to average power. So, if the LED has the brightness you like at a constant \\\\$10mA\\\\$, then it will have about the same brightness at \\\\$20mA\\\\$ pulses and a 50% duty cycle, or \\\\$40mA\\\\$ pulses and a 25% duty cycle.\n\nThere are two problems here. Firstly, when you start pulsing, even if you hold the average power the same, the *peak* power increases. This means the peak temperature increases also, and if the LED isn't given sufficient time for the heat to dissipate through the device between pulses, it will be damaged. This is what limits the peak current.\n\nThe maximum peak current will be given in the LED's datasheet. Usually, what limits the current is the LED's ability to dissipate heat. See this Cree application note for more on that: [Pulsed Over\\-Current Driving of Cree XLamp LEDs: Information and Cautions](http://www.cree.com/~/media/Files/Cree/LED%20Components%20and%20Modules/XLamp/XLamp%20Application%20Notes/XLampPulsedCurrent.pdf). Of course, these are high\\-power LEDs. Small indicator LEDs will be more fragile.\n\nThe other problem is that as current increases, \\\\$I^2R\\\\$ losses increase also, and the LED becomes overall less efficient. See [Does pulsing an LED at higher current yield greater apparent brightness?](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/17528/does-pulsing-an-led-at-higher-current-yield-greater-apparent-brightness)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an LED matrix display using multiplexing. To maintain brightness with shorter on-times, they're considering increasing the current. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding LED operation in this scenario?\n\nA) LEDs can safely be operated without any current-limiting resistor as long as the on-time is kept extremely short.\n\nB) The brightness of an LED is solely determined by its peak current, regardless of duty cycle.\n\nC) When pulsing an LED, keeping the average power constant will always result in the same brightness and efficiency as continuous operation.\n\nD) Increasing pulse current while decreasing duty cycle can maintain brightness, but may reduce efficiency and increase peak temperatures.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the trade-offs involved in pulsed LED operation. While increasing current and decreasing duty cycle can maintain average power (and thus apparent brightness), it comes with drawbacks:\n\n1. Higher peak currents lead to increased I\u00b2R losses, reducing overall efficiency.\n2. Higher peak currents also result in higher peak temperatures, which can damage the LED if heat doesn't dissipate quickly enough between pulses.\n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Even with short on-times, lack of current limiting can lead to LED damage, especially with high-current power supplies.\n\nOption B is incorrect because brightness depends on average power, not just peak current. The duty cycle is crucial in determining overall brightness.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while keeping average power constant can maintain apparent brightness, it doesn't account for the reduced efficiency and increased thermal stress that come with higher peak currents."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/28", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/143474", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/30982/"], "docs_id": 143474, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: DeVeDe 3\\.21\\.0 produces an DVD for playback in DVD players, but the Title menu does not show up.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer was found [here](https://groups.google.com/group/devede-forum/browse_thread/thread/8a87b2841c520038).\n\nIt seems that DeVeDe versions after 3\\.18 have this bug when using 12\\.04\\.\n\nReverting to 3\\.18 works."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with DeVeDe 3.21.0 on Ubuntu 12.04.

'Protect the Human' reminds us of slogans such as 'Protect the Tiger', 'Protect the Panda' etc.\n\nWhy does using 'the human' instead of 'humans' draw attention to the fact that people are vulnerable, living creatures? Is it because *conceptualisations* (this term is taken from Example 3\\) using 'the' suggest a patronizing tone? If it is, then Example 3 makes more sense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The blog post is discussing a specific construction, where \"the\" is combined with a singular noun to refer to it as a *kind* rather than a particular instance. It is a common way to refer to a kind of creature (\"the mountain lion is native to North America\"). It is not necessarily patronizing if used in this way, but using this construction to talk about kinds of people could give the impression that they are being disrespectfully categorized like animals.\n\nThere is a separate construction where \"the\" is combined with a *plural* noun referring to a category of people\u2014\"the Asians\", \"the Jews\", etc. With demographic categories, this can come across as disrespectful because it signals distancing (emphasizes that the speaker is separate from that group)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the nuanced use of the definite article \"the\" in referring to groups of people or individuals?\n\nA) Using \"the\" with a singular noun to refer to a kind is always patronizing and should be avoided in all contexts.\n\nB) The construction \"the + singular noun\" to refer to a kind is acceptable for animals but problematic for human groups, while \"the + plural noun\" for demographic categories can be seen as distancing.\n\nC) Both \"the + singular noun\" and \"the + plural noun\" constructions are equally appropriate when referring to any group of people or animals.\n\nD) Using \"the\" with either singular or plural nouns for groups is universally considered respectful and inclusive in English.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the nuances described in the documentation. The use of \"the + singular noun\" to refer to a kind (e.g., \"the tiger\") is common for animals but can be problematic when applied to human groups as it may suggest an overgeneralization or dehumanization. Meanwhile, using \"the + plural noun\" for demographic categories (e.g., \"the Asians\") can be perceived as distancing and potentially disrespectful, as it emphasizes the speaker's separation from that group.

But we get a lot of questions (at least, my review queue is full of questions) that are basically just two or three screens of unreadable garbage with a \"why doesn't this work?\" Between that, and a prose question that the OP has actually thought through, I'd prefer the prose question. If the prose question's comprehensible as it is, is it worth asking for code?\n\n(Thoughts specifically triggered by [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28681855/design-object-with-single-use/28682259), which didn't originally include any code, just the prose description. As it happens the added code isn't bad, even if it's not an MCVE, so asking the OP to post code didn't hurt.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Always?* **Hell no!**\n\nThere are problems where having an MCVE is all but essential to finding a solution. If you're *at all* familiar with the subject being asked about, you can identify these with one eye closed and the other peering through a cloudy malt beverage. If the asker forgot to include the code (or neglected to narrow it down to a specific problem area), then he has made a terrible mistake.\n\n...Then there are problems that don't really need any code, at least not in the question, but where code can be a more effective way to communicate what's being done than prose would be. Doesn't even need to be real code \\- pseudocode works fine. Your example falls into this category \\- it didn't *need* code, but the code is easier to read than the prose, and *together* they help to clarify the problem in a way that either one alone wouldn't.\n\n...and **then there are problems that don't benefit from code *at all*.** The asker is trying to do something specific, but has absolutely *no clue* how to do it \\- and any code he might include is just a waste of space:\n\n> How do I frob a widget? \n> \n> \n> I'm building a pugnacious flywheel grommet, and have found that I need to stabilize the system by frobnicating all incoming widgets. Using Java. I've searched the API docs but can find no indication of how this might be accomplished. \n> \n> \n> Here's my code:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> public class Frobnicator\n> { \n>     public Widget Frob(Widget unfrobbed)\n>       {\n>          // ????? \n>       } \n>   }\n> \n> ```\n\nThese questions are easily recognizable because the code \\- when included \\- is either entirely irrelevant to the problem, or entirely boilerplate. Sometimes both. Unlike the second class of problems, the code here actually distracts from the prose \\- I've seen folks answer these by filling in the blanks without bothering to read the actual problem statement, leading to much frustration on all sides. Fortunately, it's fairly easy to edit out the irrelevance, particularly if you're also providing an answer that makes it clearly unnecessary... \n\n...But then you run into the insidious problem of folks begging for code when none is needed. I've seen folks posting comments asking for code or linking to the MCVE or WHYT articles on questions that were already answered years ago and clearly do not need or benefit from any additions \\- in at least one instance, I observed an asker browbeaten into copying the solution *from an answer into the question,* just to quiet the complaints. \n\nThat's just annoying. \n\nWe already have guidelines for *when to include code* listed in [the How To Ask page](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

As the gas molecules are expelled from the extinguisher they still lose momentum, and this momentum is gained by Alice.\n\nAs a simpler model, imagine being on a frictionless surface while holding blocks. Now imagine throwing the blocks one at a time, each time throwing with the same force over the same time so that the blocks leave your hand at the same speed relative to you each time. Just because each block leaves your hand with the same relative velocity does not mean there is no force being exerted on you by the block. Each time you throw a block you will indeed increase your speed. Now, instead of blocks if you have many, many small molecules you are \"throwing\", the result is still the same.\n\nIn terms of impulse, you have to look at the force acting between you and the gas, not forces on the gas after it has left the extinguisher."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Alice is standing on a frictionless surface holding a fire extinguisher. When she activates the extinguisher, releasing a steady stream of gas, what happens to her motion and why?\n\nA) Alice remains stationary because the gas leaves the extinguisher at a constant velocity relative to her.\n\nB) Alice moves in the opposite direction of the gas stream due to conservation of momentum, even though the gas leaves at a constant velocity relative to her.\n\nC) Alice moves in the same direction as the gas stream because the gas pushes against her as it exits.\n\nD) Alice's motion depends on the mass of the extinguisher - she'll move only if it's lighter than her.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Even though the gas leaves the extinguisher at a constant velocity relative to Alice, she still experiences a force and moves in the opposite direction due to conservation of momentum. This is similar to the example of throwing blocks on a frictionless surface - each time a block (or in this case, gas molecules) is expelled, Alice gains momentum in the opposite direction. The constant relative velocity of the gas doesn't mean there's no force acting on Alice. The key is to consider the interaction between Alice and the gas as it's being expelled, not the gas's motion after it has left the extinguisher."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/22", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/240", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/129/"], "docs_id": 240, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do I quickly remove a lot of wall tiles without damaging the wall?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I tried the screwdriver and chisel technique with some tiles in a flat in Brighton... and quickly gave up once I found there were three layers of tiles there!

There is a lot of possible bottlenecks, to name few:\n\n**Network related**\n\nAs the number of connections grows, you can hit `worker_connections` limit of an Nginx worker process. The racyclist's description is pretty good, I'll just add few cents to it. Actually the more workers you have, the more possiblity you can hit `worker_connections` of one particular worker. The reason for that is Nginx master process cannot guarantee even distribution of connections between the workers \\-\\- some of them can process requests faster than others and thus the limit can be exceeded finally.\n\nMy advice is to use as few workers as possible with large number of `worker_connections`. However you will have to increase the number of workers if you have IO (see later). Use nginx's `status` module to watch the number of sockets it uses.\n\nYou shall likely hit OS (Linux or FreeBSD) limit on the number of per\\-process open file descriptors. Nginx will use descriptors not only for incoming requests, but for outgoing connections to backends as well. Initially this limit is set to the very low value (e.g. 1024\\). Nginx will complain in its `error.log` on this event.\n\nIf you are using `iptables` and its conntrack module (Linux), you shall exceed the size of `conntrack` table as well. Watch out `dmesg` or `/var/log/messages`. Increase this limit as necessary.\n\nSome very good optimized applications utilize 100% bandwidth. My bet is that you shall face previous problem(s) before.\n\n**IO related**\n\nIn fact, a Nginx worker blocks on IO. Thus if your site is serving static content, you will need to increase the number of Nginx workers to account for IO blocking. It's hard to give recipes here, as they vary a lot depending on the number and size of files, type of load, available memory, etc.\n\nIf you are proxying connections to some backend through Nginx, you should take into account that it creates temporary files to store the backend's answer and in the case of high traffic this can result in substantial load on the filessystem. Watch for messages in Nginx's `error.log` and tune `proxy_buffers` (or `fastcgi_buffers`) accordingly.\n\nIf you have some background IO (e.g. MySQL), it will affect static files serving as well.

The \u010cech nerve of p0:H0 \u2192 H admits a map from the original diagram H\u2022, and this map is universal among maps into (2,1)-congruences. This relationship is a categorified version of what happens when you take the coequalizer of a parallel pair of morphisms and then the kernel pair of that coequalizer.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the equivalence only holds if the original diagram H\u2022 was already a (2,1)-congruence. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the \u010cech nerve inherits properties from H\u2022, and may not necessarily be strict if H\u2022 involves weak equivalences.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as it ignores the important relationship between the \u010cech nerve and the original diagram.\n\nThis question tests understanding of advanced concepts in category theory, specifically related to groupoids, nerves, and universal properties in higher categories."}}
