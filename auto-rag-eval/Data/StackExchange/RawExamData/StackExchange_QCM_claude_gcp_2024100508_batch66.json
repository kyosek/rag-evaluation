Every log message is flushed because we need to have a record of what occurred leading up to a crash. My colleagues and I were curious about how to achieve the performance effects of buffering while guaranteeing that the log message had left the process.\n\nWhat we came\\-up with is:\n\n* make a FIFO that the application can write to, and\n* redirect the contents of that FIFO to a regular file via `cat`.\n\nThat is, what was ordinarily:\n\n```\napp --logfile logfile.txt\n\n```\n\nis now:\n\n```\nmkfifo logfifo\ncat logfifo &> logfile.txt &\napp --logfile logfifo\n\n```\n\n**Are there any gotchas to this approach?** It worked when we tested it, but we want to make absolutely sure that the messages will find their way to the redirect file even if the original application crashes.\n\n(We don't have the source code to the application, so programming solutions are out of the question. Also, the application won't write to `stdout`, so piping directly to a different command is out of the question. So `syslog` is not a possibility.)\n\n---\n\n**Update:** I've added a bounty. The accepted answer will **not** involve `logger` for the simple reason that `logger` is **not** what I've asked about. As the original question states, I am only looking for gotchas in using a FIFO.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note that a fifo is typically necessary in programming where the amount written in can surpass the amount read out.\n\nAs such a fifo wont work entirely smoothly as you anticipate but would solve your main problem whilst introducing another.\n\nThere are three possible caveats.\n\n1. Writing to the fifo is blocked indefinitely if nothing is reading the other end at initialization.\n2. The fifo has a fixed width of 64K by which if the buffer is filled by that point further writes will block until the reader has caught up.\n3. The pipe writer will by killed with SIGPIPE if the reader dies or exits.\n\nThis will mean that your problem (emulate buffered I/O on a non\\-buffered write) will be resolved. That is because the new 'limit' on your FIFO will in effect become the speed of whatever utility is writing what is in the pipe to disk (which presumably will be buffered I/O).\n\nNevertheless, the writer becomes dependant on your log reader to function. If the reader stops suddently reading, the writer will block. If the reader suddenly exits (lets say you run out of disk space on your target) the writer will SIGPIPE and probably exit.\n\nAnother point to mention is if the server panics and the kernel stops responding you may lose up to 64k of data that was in that buffer.\n\nAnother way to fix this will be to write logs to tmpfs (/dev/shm on linux) and tail the output to a fixed disk location. There are less restrictive limits on memory allocation doing this (not 64K, typically 2G!) but might not work for you if the writer has no dynamic way to reopen logfiles (you would have to clean out the logs from tmpfs periodically). If the server panics in this method you could lose a LOT more data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is using a FIFO (named pipe) to improve logging performance in an application where they don't have access to the source code. Which of the following is NOT a potential caveat of this approach?\n\nA) The application may block indefinitely if nothing is reading from the FIFO when it attempts to write.\nB) Writing to the FIFO will block if the 64K buffer is filled and the reader hasn't caught up.\nC) The application will receive a SIGPIPE signal if the reader process exits unexpectedly.\nD) Using a FIFO guarantees that all log messages will be saved even if the kernel panics.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and C are all genuine caveats of using a FIFO for logging as described in the documentation. However, option D is incorrect. The documentation specifically mentions that if the server panics and the kernel stops responding, up to 64K of data in the FIFO buffer could be lost. Therefore, using a FIFO does not guarantee that all log messages will be saved in the event of a kernel panic. This makes D the correct answer to the question asking which is NOT a caveat of the approach."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/12/02", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/84698", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/14747/"], "docs_id": 84698, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: With the advent of the dash I can easily open a file which I do not know the location of.\nHow can I find out where the file resides in the directory structure without using \"find\" or \"locate\" or another command line utility?\n\nAs far as I can tell, the search utility in nautilus will let me open the file but not open the folder where the file resides.\nThis question is related to the following questions: \n[View the folder of a selected file in the dash](https://askubuntu.com/questions/72871/view-the-folder-of-a-selected-file-in-the-dash)\nand\n[Using locate to find a directory](https://askubuntu.com/questions/15184/using-locate-to-find-a-directory)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use the command `locate` in Terminal or if you need to search for a file on the computer, there is an easy and built\\-in way to do it.\n\nLaunch the Search for Files program from the Places menu.

They seem to happen with great frequency when right clicking, but this is not restricted to a single app. It happens in Safari, Adium, NetNewsWire, etc. My gut feel is that there is that there is some common facility/plugin/routine causing this, likely from some third party extension or something else I've enabled.\n\nWhat is the best way to go about trying to troubleshoot this kind of issue?

I think this currently works on most or all browsers/platforms.\n\n*If for any reason that doesn't work, or for people who have trouble triple\\-clicking:*\n* Select the first character\\-\\-or any number of leading characters. Press `Shift`\\+`End`.\n\nThis will select from the beginning to the end. Then you can copy it like any text, such as with `Ctrl`\\+`C`.\n\nGiven those techniques, I think a single\\-line command and backslash\\-broken commands are about equally easy to copy and paste. However, I haven't tested them on all browsers (or all platforms).\n\nThe single\\-line command will be wrapped at the end of each line in a terminal, and tends to be readable in the terminal. A multi\\-line command broken with backslashes will often be broken up in the terminal as well\\-\\-unless you make each line very short\\-\\-and be less readable there as a result.\n\nBut the backslash\\-broken command is probably more readable in your post.\n\nBut the backslash\\-broken command takes more room in your post, and could consequently make the post as a whole less readable. And it is easier for you (or anyone editing the code) to make a mistake.\n\nBut if you do make a mistake, it might be easier for people reading your post to see the mistake.\n\nI don't think either way represents an identifiable best practice. It seems to me that you should use whichever way you prefer (or think is clearer in the context of your post). It's probably best to prefer one style or the other *within a single post.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When presenting long command-line instructions in technical documentation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of backslashes (\\) for line breaks?\n\nA) Using backslashes to break long commands into multiple lines is always preferable for readability and ease of copying.\n\nB) Single-line commands are superior because they are easier to copy using the triple-click method in most browsers.\n\nC) The choice between single-line and backslash-broken commands depends on the specific context and personal preference, with each approach having its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nD) Backslash-broken commands should be avoided entirely as they are more prone to errors and take up excessive space in documentation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that the choice between single-line and backslash-broken commands is largely a matter of personal style and context. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n- Single-line commands can be easily copied with techniques like triple-clicking or using Shift+End.\n- Backslash-broken commands may be more readable in a post but could be less readable in a terminal.\n- Single-line commands take up less space in a post but may require horizontal scrolling.\n- Backslash-broken commands might make errors more visible but are also easier to introduce errors when writing.\n\nThe documentation suggests that neither approach is universally better, and the choice should be based on the specific context and personal preference, while maintaining consistency within a single post.

The documentation indicates that the Caucus and Constituent badges were recently added to Stack Overflow. When new badges are introduced, they are often awarded retroactively to users who have already met the criteria in the past. In this case, the user had participated in previous elections, so when these election-related badges were introduced, they were awarded multiple times to reflect the user's past participation in different elections. This is supported by the images showing multiple award dates for each badge, corresponding to different election periods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not a bug, but an intended feature of retroactive badge awards.

However, now that we have the information necessary in hand, we can go through the process together.\n\nWe start with the *general receptacle* load \\-\\- this is 3VA (volt\\-amps) per square foot of house, or 3\\*2635 \\= 7905VA. To this, we add the *small appliance* load \\-\\- this is allocated at 1500VA per kitchen and laundry small appliance branch circuit (1 laundry and 6 kitchen in your case, conservatively treating the dishwasher and disposal circuits as SABCs) for 7\\*1500\\=10500VA. Totaling these two numbers, we get 18405VA, which we then apply a 35% *demand factor* to for everything over 3000VA, giving us 8392VA of factored load.\n\nFrom there, we then deal with major appliances. You don't have any major motor loads (such as a dedicated circuit for a well pump) in your house, and your primary HVAC load is your air conditioner at 26\\.8A; also, it appears that you have a gas water heater to go with your electric dryer and electric range. This means that we can use 9\\.6kVA as an *allowance* for the range (this handles ranges up to 50A, based on the Table 220\\.55 logic) and 5kVA as an allowance for the dryer as per NEC 220\\.54, to go with a 26\\.8A\\*230V\\=6164VA air conditioner load. Adding this all together gives us 29156VA of total demand (before the car charger), which we divide by 240V to give us 121\\.5A of service load.\n\nAdding the 9600VA (40A continuous) car charger to the existing load gives us 161\\.5A, which is over the current 150A service size, thus requiring an upgrade to 200A to fit this.\n\nAs to fitting the breaker in...\n-------------------------------\n\nHere's the bad news \\-\\- you *need* to install a subpanel to get the breaker for the EV to fit into your setup, since Square D does not make a HOMT240250, and it does not appear you have enough spare spaces otherwise to fit things in. The best bet is to move the range breaker (top left) out to the new subpanel \\-\\- this frees up space for a 100A breaker (HOM2100\\) that can then feed a 1AWG aluminum feeder (3x1AWG aluminum XHHW\\-2 in metal conduit) to a subpanel (I would use a 2 or 2\\.5\" conduit to accommodate a future upgrade of the feeder to 200A, and use a 200 or 225A main lug panel with ground bars and 42 spaces *minimum* for the sub), which can then mount a 40A 2\\-pole breaker for the range and a 50A 2\\-pole breaker for the EV charger."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is assessing a home's electrical system for an EV charger installation. The current setup includes:\n- Electric Range: 50 amps\n- Dryer: 30+20 amps\n- Air conditioner: 40+15 amps\n- Various 15 and 20 amp circuits\n\nThe homeowner wants to add a 50 amp EV Level 2 charger. The main service panel currently has 150 amp main circuit breakers. What is the most appropriate action for the electrician to take?\n\nA) Install the EV charger without any changes to the existing system\nB) Upgrade the main service panel to 200 amps and install the EV charger\nC) Install a subpanel, move the range breaker to it, and add the EV charger to the subpanel\nD) Advise against installing the EV charger due to insufficient capacity\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The current load calculation, including the EV charger, exceeds the 150A service capacity (161.5A). While upgrading to a 200A service would solve the capacity issue, it doesn't address the space limitation in the existing panel. Installing a subpanel allows for proper load distribution and creates space for the new EV charger. Moving the range breaker to the subpanel frees up space in the main panel for a 100A breaker to feed the subpanel, which can then accommodate both the range and EV charger breakers. This solution addresses both the capacity and space issues while being more cost-effective than a full service upgrade."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/11/01", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4293897", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/708144/"], "docs_id": 4293897, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The go\\-to approach for distributing n distinct objects into r alike boxes is S(n,r).

Of course, you are right that $\\\\mathbb Q\\[\\\\sqrt n]\\=\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt n)$ is always a field, so in particular a UFD.\n\nThe referenced sequence lists the [class numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_class_group#Properties) of real quadratic fields, i.e. $\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt n)$ with $n\\>0$ (and $n$ squarefree to really get different fields for different values of $n$). The class number is an arithmetical quantity attached to a field, or more precisely to its ring of integers, which measures the failure of unique factorization. It is equal to $1$ if and only if the ring of integers is a UFD. In the case of quadratic fields one can show that\n\n$$\n\\\\mathcal O(\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt n))\\=\\\\begin{cases}\\\\mathbb Z\\\\left\\[\\\\frac{1\\+\\\\sqrt n}2\\\\right]\\&,n\\\\equiv1\\\\mod 4\\\\\\\\\\\\mathbb Z\\[\\\\sqrt n]\\&,n\\\\not\\\\equiv1\\\\mod4\\\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand *these* are the rings which are UFDs exactly for the $n$ listed on $\\\\text{A}003649$, i.e. the $n$ for which the class numbers is $1$ as listed on $\\\\text{A}003172$.\n\n---\n\nThe title question is answered by *Rene Schipperus*. In general, a good way of investigating if a ring is a UFD is to find different factorizations and show that all factors are irreducible but not associated. For such quadratic rings $\\\\mathbb Z\\[\\\\sqrt n]$ a good tool for is the *norm function*:\n\n$$\n\\\\mathrm N\\\\colon\\\\mathbb Z\\[\\\\sqrt n]\\\\to\\\\mathbb Z,a\\+b\\\\sqrt n\\\\mapsto a^2\\-nb^2\n$$\n\nFor example, an element is a unit iff its norm is $\\\\{\\\\pm1\\\\}$ and if its norm is a prime, it is irreducible.

I believe the AMD CPUs will have dedicated memory banks, while the Intel CPU shares their banks. This has been said to give AMD an edge as they have direct memory access to their dedicated memory banks, but I don't think you'd notice ANY difference for most workloads if you compared the two head\\-to\\-head.\n\nNow, options on the servers, for performance, redundancy and remoting, on the other hand, are very important, more so than CPU architecture: \n\n* Redundant powersupplies\n* NICs\n* BIOS\n* RAM\n* ...and so on... Look for those.\n\nMost important, however, are the disks and their performance/redundancy/configurations:\n\n* RAID hardware performance\n* RAID configuration\n* Diskdrive performance\n* Redundancy outside the RAID configuration such as hot\\-swappable drives, hot spare disk etc.\n\nSecond most important is the OS. The most performance you'll get from a 64\\-bit system, so go with that.

But I think it's worth explaining that there's a general formalism that makes this type of result transparent. I'm sorry if this is clear to you already.\n\nLet $$\\\\Gamma\\_G : \\\\mathrm{Mod}\\_{k\\[G]} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Mod}\\_k$$\nbe the functor of taking $G$\\-invariants ($k$ is some ground ring). It is left exact, and $\\\\mathrm{Mod}\\_{k\\[G]}$ has enough injectives, so it admits a derived functor\n$$ R\\\\Gamma\\_G : D^\\+(\\\\mathrm{Mod}\\_{k\\[G]}) \\\\to D^\\+(\\\\mathrm{Mod}\\_k).$$\nThe derived functor goes between derived categories.\n\nHypercohomology can be expressed in terms of $R\\\\Gamma\\_G$: if $M^\\\\bullet$ is a cochain complex of $G$\\-modules, then $H^q(R\\\\Gamma\\_G(M^\\\\bullet)) \\= \\\\mathbb H^q(G,M^\\\\bullet)$.\n\nNow *by definition* quasi\\-isomorphisms of cochain complexes are isomorphisms in the derived category. So the fact that group hypercohomology takes quasi\\-isomorphisms to isomorphisms is equivalent, in the language of derived categories, to the statement that $R\\\\Gamma\\_G$ takes isomorphisms to isomorphisms. That is, the claim that you want is implicit in the statement that hypercohomology is a *functor between derived categories*.\n\nSo in a sense, once you know that group cohomology is a derived functor, then a reference for your statement is any textbook that explains how to talk about derived functors in the language of derived categories, e.g. [Gelfand and Manin \\- Methods of homological algebra](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-12492-5), Yekutieli's book \"Derived categories\", Verdier's thesis, or the [Stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a group \u0393 = {1,\u03b3} of order 2 and a \u0393-module A.

This follows from the proposition stated in the documentation, which says that if (\u03c61,\u03c60) is a quasi-isomorphism, then the induced homomorphism on hypercohomology \u03c6* : \u210dk(\u0393, A1 \u2192 A0) \u2192 \u210dk(\u0393, A1' \u2192 A0') is an isomorphism.

Group hypercohomology, being a derived functor between derived categories, takes these isomorphisms to isomorphisms.

Based on my results below this appears to be in order of innermost to outermost with exterior rings being listed before the interior rings within them.\n\nAdditionally interior rings (green lines) are always within exterior rings (red lines). It is possible to have rings that overlap each other, self\\-intersections, etc., but typically these are considered topologically incorrect and are [simplified](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/index.html#//002m000003w0000000) before they are stored.\n\n**Another important point is the distinction between parts and rings.** A feature can have multiple parts, and a part can have multiple rings. In the picture below, think of each solid red shape as an individual part, each having a single exterior ring and 0, 1, or more inner rings.\n\n[![Polygons with multiple nested ring levels](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYUDs.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYUDs.gif)  \n\n(source: [arcgis.com](http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/componenthelp/bitmaps/GeomPolygons.gif)) \n\n**For each part, the first ring is the outer ring, while all subsequent rings are inner rings.** The vertices of outer rings are oriented in a clockwise fashion while inner rings are oriented counter\\-clockwise.\n\n**Now to get practical:**\n\nYou can use the [geometry objects](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//002z0000001s000000) in arcpy to access the parts, rings, and vertices of a feature. There is a null point between the rings of a part. You could iterate over the parts and points, checking for the null point to see if there are interior rings.\n\nSee the Python script below. This defines a [generator function](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) to list the X, Y, FID, part, ring, and vertex indexes which is called repeatedly within a [SearchCursor](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//000v00000039000000) to write to a CSV file using the [`csv`](http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html) module.\n\nThe FID, part, and ring indices uniquely identify each ring, and you know that if the ring index is 0 it's an exterior ring. If the ring index is greater than 0, it's an interior ring. One tweak you might want to make is to remove the last point of each ring as it will always be the same as the first point, to make a closed ring. To do that just set `skiplastvertex = True` near the top of the script.

That 95%CI just indicates that if this study is repeated for many times, approximately 95% of them will have their confidence intervals including the true weight difference (which is unknown to us).\n\nNow, the tricky parts are: i) you really don't know if your study is among those 95%, or the unfortunate 5% which committed a type I error (mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true.) ii) 95% of them will include the true difference doesn't mean that exact true difference is what your study found; aka your statement is implying that what your study found is the population's true difference, which is quite unlikely. And iii) the statement is vague enough to be interpreted in the individual level (e.g. 95 out of 100 clients will gain weight or 95% success rate), which is not entirely correct because 95%CI are for population mean inference.\n\nBecause of the reasons above, I'd advise against using the proposed interpretation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducts a paired sample t-test on weight measurements before and after a treatment, finding a statistically significant change.

Let me argue why this is impossible.\n\nWe can assume w.l.o.g. that the coordinates $(u,v)$ on the tangent plane to $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ at $q$ were chosen so that $\\\\exp\\_q$ maps the axis $(u,0\\)$ to the great circle connecting $q$\u00a0and\u00a0$p$, and more precisely, if $0\\<\\\\delta\\<\\\\pi$ is the distance between $q$\u00a0and\u00a0$p$ on $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$, that $\\\\exp\\_q$ takes $(\\\\delta,0\\)$ to\u00a0$p$.

But the inverse image of $\\\\tilde q$ by $\\\\exp\\_p$ is discrete (since $\\\\exp\\_p$ is a diffeomorphism outside of circles of radius $k\\\\pi$ around the origin which are mapped to either $p$ or its antipode $\\\\tilde p$, and we are assuming $p,q,\\\\tilde p,\\\\tilde q$ distinct); and $\\\\psi$ must map $C$ (which is connected) inside this inverse image: so $\\\\psi$ must be constant on\u00a0$C$. But this contradicts the fact that $\\\\psi(\\\\pi,0\\) \\= (\\\\pi\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ and $\\\\psi(\\-\\\\pi,0\\) \\= (\\-\\\\pi\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ (as per previous paragraph) are not equal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A stealth missile M is launched from a space station at an unknown direction but with a known constant speed v_m.

How can you have an even in the past with a verb (*can*) apparently in the present. Well, you can. The sentence **is** grammatically correct.\n\nThe word *Can* is listed in the *Oxford English Grammar \\[OEG]* as one of many **auxiliaries** (words that help the meaning of some other verb. Some such words can function as verbs in their own right. \n\nFor example, *have* can function as a verb in its own right, as in \"I **have** a book\" (present tense) or \"I **had** a book\" (past tense); or it can function as an auxiliary, as in \"They **have** never seen the Great Wall of China\".\n\nThe word *can* (apart from the misleadingly identically spelled container) only exists as an auxiliary, followed by some verb, and meaning *be able to*. Sidney Greenbaum of OEG lists *can* among a long list of such auxiliaries, such a *ought, may, will, etc..*.

If she is right, then the manager was right: Dembelele **didn't** say much, either in length or offensiveness. If not there are plenty of worse things Dembelele could have said in French or, for that matter, Spanish that would have been very offensive indeed. \n\nIn the context of what the commentator wrote, a correct, only slightly different alternative would have been:\\- \n\n> Dembelele *couldn't* have said much to the referee.\n\nYour alternative (\"Dembelele couldn't say much to the referee.\") is correct English, but means something slightly different. That would mean that the player would have been unable to say much the referee, because (for example) his team captain got between them and pushed him back, shouting at him to shut up.\n\n*Cannot* is present, and refers to the (present) **fact that** it cannot (**now**) be the case that Dembelele (**then**) said much. If you use *couldn't have* then the sentence is entirely related to the past: a slight but real difference."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"cannot\" in the sentence \"Dembelele cannot have said much to the referee\" is most accurate?\n\nA) The use of \"cannot\" in this context is grammatically incorrect because it mixes present and past tenses.\n\nB) \"Cannot\" in this sentence refers to a present impossibility about a past event.\n\nC) The sentence would be more grammatically correct if \"couldn't\" was used instead of \"cannot.\"\n\nD) \"Cannot\" in this context indicates that Dembelele was physically unable to speak to the referee at the time of the incident.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The use of \"cannot\" in \"Dembelele cannot have said much to the referee\" is grammatically correct and refers to a present impossibility about a past event. It expresses that, based on current knowledge or evidence, it is not possible that Dembelele said much to the referee in the past incident.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the use of \"cannot\" in this context is grammatically correct, despite appearing to mix tenses.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while \"couldn't have\" could be used, it's not more grammatically correct than \"cannot have\" in this context.

Using R, fake data might be something like this:\n\n```\ncount    <- rpois(8, 10)\nspecies  <- rep(c(\"a\", \"b\"), 4)\nhost     <- rep(c(\"c\",\"c\", \"d\", \"d\"), 2)\nrain     <- c(rep(0,4), rep(1,4))\nmy.table <- xtabs(count ~ host + species + rain)\n\n, , rain = 0\n\n    species\nhost  a  b\n   c 12 15\n   d 10 13\n\n, , rain = 1\n\n    species\nhost  a  b\n   c 11 12\n   d 12  7\n\n```\n\nNow, I want to know two things: Are species associated with host plants? Does \"rain or not\" effect this association? I used `loglm()` from `MASS` for this:\n\n```\n # Are species independent to host plants, given the effect of rain?\nloglm(~species + host + rain + species*rain + host*rain, data=my.table)\n\n # Given any relationship between host plants and species, does rain change it?\nloglm(~species + host + rain + species*host)\n\n```\n\nThis is a little outside my comfort level, and I wanted to check that I'd set the models up right and that this was the best way to approach these questions. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two ways to interpret your first question, which are reflected in the two ways you asked it: \u201cAre species associated with host plants?\u201d and, \u201cAre species independent to host plants, given the effect of rain?\u201d \n\nThe first interpretation corresponds to a model of *joint independence*, which states that species and hosts are dependent, but jointly independent of whether it rained:\n\n$\\\\quad p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_{sh} p\\_r$\n\nwhere $p\\_{shr}$ is the probability that an observation falls into the $(s,h,r)$ cell where $s$ indexes species, $h$ host type, and $r$ rain value, $p\\_{sh}$ is the marginal probability of the $(s,h,\\\\cdot)$ cell where we collapse over the rain variable, and $p\\_r$ is the marginal probability of rain. \n\nThe second interpretation corresponds to a model of *conditional independence*, which states that species and hosts are independent given whether it rained:\n\n$\\\\quad p\\_{sh\\|r} \\= p\\_{s\\|r}p\\_{h\\|r}$ or $p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_{sr}p\\_{hr} / p\\_r$\n\nwhere $p\\_{sh\\|r}$ is the conditional probability of the $(s,h,r)$ cell, given a value of $r$.\n\nYou can test these models in R (`loglin` would work fine too but I\u2019m more familiar with `glm`):\n\n```\ncount <- c(12,15,10,13,11,12,12,7)\nspecies <- rep(c(\"a\", \"b\"), 4)\nhost <- rep(c(\"c\",\"c\", \"d\", \"d\"), 2)\nrain <- c(rep(0,4), rep(1,4))\nmy.table <- xtabs(count ~ host + species + rain)\nmy.data <- as.data.frame.table(my.table)\nmod0 <- glm(Freq ~ species + host + rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod1 <- glm(Freq ~ species * host + rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod2 <- glm(Freq ~ (species + host) * rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nanova(mod0, mod1, test=\"Chi\") #Test of joint independence\nanova(mod0, mod2, test=\"Chi\") #Test of conditional independence\n\n```\n\nAbove, `mod1` corresponds to joint independence and `mod2` corresponds to conditional independence, whereas `mod0` corresponds to a *mutual independence* model $p\\_{shr} \\= p\\_s p\\_h p\\_r$. You can see the parameter estimates using `summary(mod2)`, etc. As usual, you should check to see if model assumptions are met. In the data you provided, the null model actually fits adequately. \n\nA different way of approaching your first question would be to perform Fischer\u2019s exact test (`fisher.test(xtabs(count ~ host + species))`) on the collapsed 2x2 table (first interpretation) or the Mantel\\-Haenszel test (`mantelhaen.test(xtabs(count ~ host + species + rain))`) for 2\\-stratified 2x2 tables or to write a permutation test that respects the stratification (second interpretation). \n\nTo paraphrase your second question, *Does the relationship between species and host depend on whether it rained?*\n\n```\nmod3 <- glm(Freq ~ species*host*rain - species:host:rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nmod4 <- glm(Freq ~ species*host*rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\nanova(mod3, mod4, test=\u201dChi\u201d)\npchisq(deviance(mod3), df.residual(mod3), lower=F)\n\n```\n\nThe full model `mod4` is saturated, but you can test the effect in question by looking at the deviance of `mod3` as I've done above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a three-level contingency table analysis of species, host plants, and rainfall, which R code would be most appropriate to test whether the relationship between species and host plants depends on rainfall?\n\nA) loglm(~species + host + rain + species*host, data=my.table)\n\nB) glm(Freq ~ species*host + rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\n\nC) glm(Freq ~ species*host*rain - species:host:rain, data=my.data, family=poisson())\n\nD) fisher.test(xtabs(count ~ host + species))\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A uses loglm() but doesn't include the three-way interaction necessary to test if rain affects the species-host relationship.\nOption B tests for joint independence but doesn't consider how rain might modify the species-host association.\nOption C is correct because it includes all two-way interactions and tests the three-way interaction (species*host*rain) by comparing models with and without this term.\nOption D is Fisher's exact test, which is for 2x2 tables and doesn't account for the third variable (rain) at all.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows us to test whether the relationship between species and host depends on rainfall by comparing this model to a fully saturated model, as shown in the documentation."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/11/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/74548143", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/610569/"], "docs_id": 74548143, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When trying to use Huggingface estimator on sagemaker, Run training on Amazon SageMaker e.g.\n\n```\n# create the Estimator\nhuggingface_estimator = HuggingFace(\n        entry_point='train.py',\n        source_dir='./scripts',\n        instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge',\n        instance_count=1,\n        role=role,\n        transformers_version='4.17',\n        pytorch_version='1.10',\n        py_version='py38',\n        hyperparameters = hyperparameters\n)\n\n```\n\nWhen I tried to increase the version to transformers\\_version\\='4\\.24', it throws an error where the maximum version supported is 4\\.17\\.\n\n**How to use AWS Sagemaker with newer version of Huggingface Estimator?**\n\nThere's a note on using newer version for inference on [https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/deploying\\-open\\-ais\\-whisper\\-on\\-sagemaker/24761/9](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/deploying-open-ais-whisper-on-sagemaker/24761/9) but it looks like the way to use it for training with the Huggingface estimator is kind of complicated [https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/huggingface\\-pytorch\\-versions\\-on\\-sagemaker/26315/5?u\\=alvations](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/huggingface-pytorch-versions-on-sagemaker/26315/5?u=alvations) and it's not confirmed that the complicated steps can work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use the Pytorch estimator and in your source directory place a requirements.txt with Transformers added to it.

Now, for each $r\\_i$\\-partite set, we are blocked from making $r\\_i\\\\choose 2$ edges. However, this is the only restriction on edges, so the number of edges in a complete multipartite graph $K(r\\_1,\\\\ldots, r\\_k)$ is just\n\n$\\|E\\|\\={N\\\\choose2}\\-\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=1}^k{r\\_i\\\\choose 2}$\n\nHence, if you want to $\\\\textit{maximize}$ the number of edges for a given $k$, you can just choose each sets such that $r\\_i\\=1\\\\forall i$, which gives you the maximum $N\\\\choose 2$.\n\nIf on the other hand you want to $\\\\textit{minimize}$ the number of edges for a given $k$, we can use a little switching argument to show that the minimum occurs when all the $r\\_i$s are as near to $\\\\frac{N}{k}$ as possible. \n\nHere's the switching argument: Let $r\\=\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{N}{k}\\\\rfloor$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist $r\\_i$ and $r\\_j$ such that $r\\_j\\-r\\_i\\\\geq 2$ in a $k$\\-partite graph $M$ with a minimum number of edges. Let $\\|M\\|$ denote the number of edges in $M$. Consider now $M'$ which we create from $M$ by taking a vertex $x$ in the $r\\_j$ set and adding it to the $r\\_j$ set. This switch adds $r\\_j\\-1$ edges and gets rid of $r\\_i$ edges. Hence $\\|M'\\|\\=\\|M\\|\\+r\\_j\\-1\\-r\\_i\\\\leq \\|M\\|\\-1$ Hence we have a contradiction. This means that the sizes of two sets cannot differ in size by more than $1$. Hence a $k$\\-partite graph of minimum size must must have $r\\_i\\\\in\\\\{r,r\\+1\\\\}$ for all $i\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,k\\\\}$. In particular, if $N\\\\equiv h \\\\mod k$.

The `\\documentclass` command specifically looks like this:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[preview, convert={density=300}]{standalone}\n\n```\n\nIf the source file is named `main.tex`, compiling it will result in producing the `main.pdf` and `main.png` files.\n\n`latexmk` runs only once the first time `main.png` is created. However, it goes into an endless loop once I begin updating the source file (and hence the `main.pdf` and `main.png`)\n\nI think this is because `latexmk` mistakes the `main.png` file as part of the source for building the final `main.pdf`.\n\nIs there a way to exclude certain files from being monitored by `latexmk`? I searched inside `man latexmk` but there are no occurrences of \"exclude\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can reproduce this with `latexmk 4.35`. The issue is that the created `png` file contains date\\+time created meta\\-information which changes on every run, and `latexmk` thinks the `png` file is part of the input, not output. I cannot think of an appropriate regular expression for `$hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'png'}` to really solve this at the right level since `png`s are binary files.\n\nHowever, I can help you to get `latexmk` to ignore the generated `png` file. The reason why `latexmk` thinks the `png` file is an input to your document is that in `standalone.cls`, there are commands like `\\IfFileExists{\\outfile` with various forms of file extensions to detect if conversion succeeded. Therefore, as far as `pdflatex` knows, you are reading that file during the run, but it knows nothing about you writing the file as it is done externally to the TeX engine. This information that `pdflatex` has is picked up by `latexmk` through the `recorder` feature. Disabling the `recorder` feature (by adding `-recorder-` to the `latexmk` options) means `latexmk` becomes ignorant of the `png` file and cannot therefore rerun when it changes. I am not aware of any feature in `latexmk` that allows you to specify an 'ignore dependants' list within which you could specifically name the output `png` file.\n\nAlso, from the `standalone` manual:\n\n> `standalone` executes the same LaTeX compiler (e.g. `pdflatex`) again as a sub\\-process which compiles the current document fully. This is done when the standalone class is loaded, so that the main compiler instance is still at `\\documentclass` and has not yet itself opened the output file for writing. After the document got compiled using the sub\\-process the external conversion tool will be executed. If required intermediate conversions like `dvips` are also executed beforehand. Finally the main compiler run is terminated without producing any output, keeping the output file generated by the sub\\-process intact. A drawback of this implementation is that the `log` file created by the sub\\-process is overwritten by the main process and does not hold meaningful information. This can be compensated by setting a different `jobname` for the sub\\-process using the `subjobname` conversion setting.\n\nNote this refers to running `pdflatex` on the subjob, not `latexmk`! As `latexmk` is reliant on the information in the `log` file, we should follow the suggestion of using a different jobname for the sub\\-process.\n\nThere are therefore two steps which together seem to workaround the problem at this stage:\n\n* Use the `subname` option to the `convert` settings in `standalone`.\n* Pass the `-recorder-` option to `latexmk` to disable the `recorder` feature of `pdflatex` (so the generated `png` file is not identified as a dependant).\n\nMWE (called `converttest.tex` for the command line given below):\n\n```\n\\documentclass[preview, convert={density=300,subjobname=\\jobname-converted}]{standalone}\n\\begin{document}\n    Hello.\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n`latexmk` command line: `latexmk -pdf -shell-escape -recorder- \"converttest\"`\n\nThen, change the TeX file, perhaps changing `Hello` to `Hello world` and re\\-run the same `latexmk` command\\-line. Things work if `-recorder-` is used but not otherwise. But now remember that the output image has a different filename (`-converted` is appended)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the 'standalone' package with image conversion and latexmk, which combination of steps can help prevent latexmk from entering an endless compilation loop?\n\nA) Use the 'subname' option in standalone's convert settings and enable the 'recorder' feature in latexmk\nB) Disable the 'recorder' feature in latexmk and use a different jobname for the main document\nC) Use the 'subname' option in standalone's convert settings and disable the 'recorder' feature in latexmk\nD) Enable the 'recorder' feature in latexmk and use the same jobname for both main and sub-processes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

But for heavy objects the influence of the air resistance will be smaller, if they have a similar surface area compared to the light objects.\n\nThe answer depends on the properties of your tyres and the road. But on an even road the air resistance will typically dominate once you reach a certain speed (the friction of the wheels $F\\_W$ will be more or less independent of speed, but not of weight as a heavier person deforms the tyres more, generation more friction, but as it is not the dominant part we will ignore it for now).\n\nThe air resistance of a person will vary approximately like $m^{2/3}$ or $m^{1/3}$ in dependence of the mass. The air resistance in turbulent flow is given by $F\\_R \\= \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\rho c\\_D A v^2$, where $\\\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $c\\_D$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient depending on the form, $A$ is the area of the object perpendicular to the flow and $v$ the velocity relative to the fluid. Your mass scales like $L^3$, so your area scales like $L^2 \\= m^{2/3}$ assuming isotropic growth, the drag coefficent $c\\_D$ will be roughly independent of your weight but highly dependent on your position and clothing, which also influence your surface area).\n\nYour acceleration will be given by:\n$$ a \\= g \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\+ F\\_\\\\text{W} \\- \\\\frac 1 2 c\\_D \\\\rho v^2 \\\\frac{A}{m} \\= \\\\text{const} \\- O(m^{\\-1/3}). $$\n\nThis means you are at an advantage if you are heavier (or rather: larger and therefore heavier), as the influence of the drag scales like $m^{\\-1/3}$.\n\nIf we assume that your weight is not distributed equally in all directions you gain even more.

This increasing air resistance opposes the constant gravitational force component g sin(\u03b8), causing the net acceleration to decrease. Eventually, the cyclist will approach a terminal velocity where the acceleration becomes zero.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the acceleration is not constant due to changing air resistance.\nOption B is incorrect as the acceleration decreases, not increases, with velocity.\nOption D, while true in isolation, is not the most accurate statement about the cyclist's acceleration in this scenario."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/11", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/164563", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/36793/"], "docs_id": 164563, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a theory $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\Phi^\\\\dagger)(\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\Phi)\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\Phi^\\\\dagger\\\\Phi)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\Phi^\\\\dagger\\\\Phi)^2$$ where $\\\\Phi\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\phi\\_1\\+i\\\\phi\\_2\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi\\_0\\+i\\\\phi\\_3\\\\end{pmatrix}$ is a complex $SU(2\\)$ doublet. After symmetry breaking there is no residual symmetry and hence there are $(2^2\\-1\\)\\=3$ goldstone bosons. The same Lagrangian can also be written as $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\phi\\_i)^2\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}\\\\phi\\_i^2\\)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{3}\\\\phi\\_i^2\\)^2$$ which is nothing but the Lagrangian of linear sigma model. After symmetry breaking the symmetry of the Lagrangian reduces from $O(4\\)$ to $O(3\\)$. Therefore, there are $3$ goldstone bosons once again and the results match. However, I'm having a confusion with the following. Consider the theory $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\xi^\\\\dagger)(\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\xi)\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\xi^\\\\dagger\\\\xi)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\xi^\\\\dagger\\\\xi)^2$$ where $\\\\xi\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\xi\\_1\\+i\\\\xi\\_2\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi\\_3\\+i\\\\xi\\_4\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi\\_0\\+i\\\\xi\\_5\\\\end{pmatrix}$ is a complex $SU(2\\)$ triplet. The Lagrangian is again $SU(2\\)$ invariant. Right? After SSB there is no residual symmetry and umber of goldstone boson is 3\\. However, if we write it as $$\\\\mathcal{L}\\=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{5}(\\\\partial\\_\\\\mu\\\\xi\\_i)^2\\-\\\\mu^2(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{5}\\\\xi\\_i^2\\)\\-\\\\lambda(\\\\sum\\\\limits\\_{i\\=0}^{5}\\\\xi\\_i^2\\)^2$$ then $O(6\\)$ symmetry breaks down to $O(5\\)$ and number of Goldstone bosons is $\\=5$. So it doesn't match. Then where am I making the mistake? What is the correct number of Goldstone bosons in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your first two theories, *\u03a6* in the spinor rep of SU(2\\), and *\u03c6* in the vector rep of O(4\\), are dealt with correctly, with 3 generators broken in both cases, so 3 goldstons and one massive field. \n\nYou have completely messed up the counting and symmetry structure of your latter theory. The first form, with a complex triplet *\u03be*, is SU(3\\)\\-, not just SU(2\\), invariant, and this SU(3\\) breaks down to the residual SU(2\\) by the v.e.v., so 8\\-3\\=5 broken generators, and thus 5 goldstons, and one residual massive field, just as in the language of your O(4\\)/O(3\\) vector representation model. \n\nI am unclear as to how you concluded, erroneously, that \"there is no residual SU(2\\)\". There is: it mixes up the components not involving the v.e.v. So, for example, if the v.e.v. is dialed to the 3rd component, the SU(2\\) subgroup mixing up the upper two components ($\\\\lambda\\_1, \\\\lambda\\_2,\\\\lambda\\_3$ Gell\\-Mann matrices) is unbroken.

After SSB, this breaks down to a residual SU(2) symmetry. The number of Goldstone bosons is equal to the number of broken generators, which is 8 (SU(3)) - 3 (SU(2)) = 5.

In this case, it's multivariate simply because it contains multiple variables (Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape) that can be analyzed together. The question highlights a common misconception about multivariate data - it doesn't necessarily require designated response variables or proven correlations. Any dataset with multiple variables that can be analyzed in relation to each other can be considered multivariate.
