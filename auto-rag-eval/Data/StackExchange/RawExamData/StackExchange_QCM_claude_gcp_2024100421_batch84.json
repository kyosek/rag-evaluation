My project is about designing a solar dish having a diameter of 1\\.5 meters and a focal length of 60cm. so at the focal point, a circular coil (copper pipe) will be folded, in order to have a superheated steam as an output. What I'm struggling to know is: How to calculate the Power at the focal point?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The upper bound is easy. The [solar constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant) through the atmosphere is about $970W \\\\over m^2$ so you're gathering at most $\\\\pi\\\\cdot((0\\.75m)^2 \\\\cdot 970W / m^2 \\= 1\\.7kW$ \n\nIf your focal point is perfect (it isn't) then you'd have infinite [power density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density).\n\nYou will need to measure the actual power produced (and therefor the efficiency) because it depends on a lot of factors like the reflectivity of the coper and so forth.\n\n*Edit: [fixed solar constant to account for atmospheric absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_%28solar_energy%29)*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A solar dish with a diameter of 1.5 meters and a focal length of 60cm is designed to generate superheated steam. Given that the solar constant through the atmosphere is approximately 970 W/m\u00b2, calculate the following:\n\n1. What is the maximum theoretical power that can be gathered by this solar dish?\n2. If the actual measured power output at the focal point is 1.2 kW, what is the overall efficiency of the system?\n3. What factor is NOT likely to affect the actual power output at the focal point?\n\nA) 1. 1.7 kW, 2. 70.6%, 3. The reflectivity of the dish surface\nB) 1. 1.7 kW, 2. 70.6%, 3. The Earth's rotational speed\nC) 1. 2.1 kW, 2. 57.1%, 3. The focal length of the dish\nD) 1. 2.1 kW, 2. 57.1%, 3. The ambient air temperature\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n1. The maximum theoretical power is calculated using the formula: Power = \u03c0 * (diameter/2)\u00b2 * solar constant\n   Power = \u03c0 * (1.5m/2)\u00b2 * 970 W/m\u00b2 \u2248 1.7 kW\n\n2. Efficiency = (Actual power output / Maximum theoretical power) * 100%\n   Efficiency = (1.2 kW / 1.7 kW) * 100% \u2248 70.6%\n\n3. The Earth's rotational speed is not likely to directly affect the power output at the focal point. The other factors mentioned (reflectivity of the dish surface, focal length, and ambient air temperature) can all impact the actual power output.\n\nOption B is correct because it accurately states the maximum theoretical power, the calculated efficiency, and correctly identifies a factor that is not likely to affect the power output at the focal point."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/05", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/199495", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/97724/"], "docs_id": 199495, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to spot an enemy jet behind me when on a jet\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can sign in on any Xbox 360 just by entering your username and password on it, then downloading the profile.

A notable exception is the most celebrated result of recent years, the proof of Fermat's last theorem by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles in 1994 \\[...]\n> To complete his proof, Wiles assumed the existence of a type of large cardinal known as an inaccessible cardinal, technically overstepping the bounds of conventional arithmetic\"\n\nIs this true ?\nIf so, could someone please outline how they are used ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic contention here is that Wiles' work uses cohomology of sheaves on certain Grothendieck topologies, the general theory of which was first developed in Grothendieck's SGAIV and which requires the existence of an uncountable [Grothendieck universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_universe). It has since been clarified that the existence of such a thing is equivalent to the existence of an [inaccessible cardinal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal), and that this existence \\-\\- or even the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal! \\-\\- cannot be proved from ZFC alone, assuming that ZFC is consistent.\n\nMany working arithmetic and algebraic geometers however take it as an article of faith that in any use of Grothendieck cohomology theories to solve a \"reasonable problem\", the appeal to the universe axiom can be bypassed. Doubtless this faith is ~~predicated on~~ abetted by the fact that most arithmetic and algebraic geometers (present company included) are not really conversant or willing to wade into the intricacies of set theory. I have not really thought about such things myself so have no independent opinion, but I have heard from one or two mathematicians that I respect that removing this set\\-theoretic edifice is not as straightforward as one might think.

Manin made a point of asking in public whether the proof of the Weil conjectures depends in some essential way on inaccessible cardinals, is this not a sign that \"Of course not; don't be stupid\" may not be the most helpful reply?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and inaccessible cardinals in set theory?\n\nA) Wiles' proof explicitly uses inaccessible cardinals as a fundamental part of its argument.\n\nB) The proof relies on cohomology theories that, in their most general form, assume the existence of Grothendieck universes, which are equivalent to inaccessible cardinals.\n\nC) Inaccessible cardinals are necessary for the proof, and this requirement cannot be eliminated or simplified.\n\nD) The proof has no connection to inaccessible cardinals or advanced set theory concepts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Wiles' proof uses cohomology theories developed in Grothendieck's work, which in their most general formulation assume the existence of Grothendieck universes. These universes are equivalent to inaccessible cardinals in set theory. However, it's important to note that many mathematicians believe that for specific applications like Wiles' proof, the reliance on such large cardinal axioms can likely be avoided or simplified, even if doing so is not straightforward. The proof doesn't explicitly use inaccessible cardinals (ruling out A), and while there is a connection to advanced set theory through the background theories used, it's not definitively necessary for the specific proof (ruling out C). Option D is incorrect because there is indeed a connection, albeit indirect, to these set-theoretic concepts through the cohomology theories employed."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/21", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/245135", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/87590/"], "docs_id": 245135, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I put up some temporary paper shades with the stick\\-on backing that were positioned on the **vinyl** part of my windows.

If I'm right, this smearing is necessary to determine the position of a particle in QFT. Why is that necessary? And please, spare my poor soul from a lot a math ;\\-)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fundamental particles in QFT are mathematical points with no size. This leads to so\\-called \"ultraviolet\" (or short\\-distance) divergences (infinities) as the distance between two particles becomes arbitrarily small. The \"smoothing\" procedure is one way to \"regulate\" (or make finite) the divergences by averaging the position of the particle over some small but finite volume. This effectively treats the particle as if it had some size, which mathematically tames the divergences. Of course we are ultimately interested in taking the limit where the size of the particle goes to zero, so smoothing is usually just the first step in a process to understand how to take this limit consistently.\n\nYou may be familiar with the potential of a point charge in electromagnetism\n\\\\begin{equation}\nV(r) \\= k \\\\frac{q}{r}\n\\\\end{equation}\nwhere $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge of the particle, and $r$ is the distance from the particle. As $r\\\\rightarrow 0$, $V\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$. This is an example of an ultraviolet divergence as you get arbitrarily close to a point particle. One manifestation of this divergence is that the *self\\-energy* of the point charge $U \\= \\\\frac{1}{8\\\\pi k}\\\\int d^3 x E^2$ (where $E$ is the electric field) is infinite.\n\nAn example of a \"smoothing\" procedure would be to replace the charged particle with a ball of radius $a$ with the same charge. Then the maximum value of the potential is $V(a) \\= k q / a$; inside the ball, the potential drops smoothly to zero, rather than racing off to infinity. The self energy is finite."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In quantum field theory (QFT), why is the process of \"smearing\" or \"smoothing\" necessary when dealing with fundamental particles?\n\nA) To increase the mass of particles and make them easier to detect\nB) To create a visual representation of particles for better understanding\nC) To regulate ultraviolet divergences that occur due to point-like nature of particles\nD) To slow down particles and make their behavior more predictable\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In QFT, fundamental particles are treated as mathematical points with no size. This leads to ultraviolet (short-distance) divergences as the distance between particles approaches zero. The process of \"smearing\" or \"smoothing\" is used to regulate these divergences by averaging the particle's position over a small but finite volume. This effectively gives the particle a size, which helps to mathematically manage the infinities that would otherwise occur.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because smearing doesn't affect the mass of particles. \nAnswer B is incorrect as the purpose isn't for visualization but for mathematical treatment. \nAnswer D is incorrect because smearing doesn't affect the speed or predictability of particles.\n\nThe analogy with electromagnetism helps illustrate this concept: just as replacing a point charge with a charged ball of finite radius prevents the potential from becoming infinite at the center, smearing in QFT prevents similar infinities in particle interactions."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/38789", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/15841/"], "docs_id": 38789, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I remove the *Workspace Switcher* launcher from the Unity dock?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### For 14\\.04\n\nDrag the undesirable icon on the trash can.\n\n### For 13\\.04\n\nBy default, the workspace\\-switcher is not enabled in the Launcher.

There are a couple of ways you can do it:\n\n* Raster Calculator \\- simply use the raster calculator and you can set the resolution and extent there and can make them match another raster by selecting the raster band you want to match in the Raster Bands list and then clicking the \"Current layer extent\" button. The columns and rows fields will let you set the resolution. However, this method gives you no control over the resampling method.\n* Using [GDAL\\_Warp](http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html) \\- this tool lets you set the output resolution either by specifying the width and height of the output raster or by specifying the \\-tr switch (see the documentation). You can get to the GDAL\\_warp tool by going Raster\\-\\>Projections\\-\\>Warp (I did say it wasn't obvious from a resampling point of view!). \n\n\t+ (v2\\.x) If you want to use the \\-tr switch, fill in all the boxes for input raster and output etc (your source and target SRS values will presumably be the same in this case \\- though don't have to be if you're reprojecting as well). Then click the little pencil icon at the bottom and edit the auto\\-generated gdal\\-warp commandline to include your \\-tr switch. Gdal\\_wrap lets you specif the algorithm you want to use for the resampling and so is a little less of a blunt instrument than using the raster calculator.\n\t+ (v3\\.x) The \\-tr switch is enabled by using the *Output file resolution in target georeferenced units* box. For example, to downsample a 1m DEM to a 2m DEM, you can enter 2 in that field. However, there is no option to pass two different arguments for non\\-square pixels. Say your target pixel size is `0.3125,0.25`, meaning the `xres` is `0.3125` and the `yres` is `0.25`. If you now pass the value `0.3125` in that box, it will set `-tr 0.3125 0.3125` in the command. To counter this limitation, simply copy the code, paste to the command line, edit the \\-tr flag and run. For example: \n\n\t`gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 -tr 0.3125 0.25 -r near -te 71.40625 24.875 84.21875 34.375 -te_srs EPSG:4326 -of GTiff foo.tiff bar.tiff`\n\n\t(depending on your instalation and environment variables, you may also need to explicitly state the path to gdalwarp)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to resample two geotiff images to the same resolution in QGIS.

Variance from both types of variables are accounted for in a linear model (e.g., regression, ANCOVA). So, a covariate is not just a third variable not directly related to the dependent variable. It is merely a dimensional variable.\n\nThe reason statistical packages have options for both of these is because the statistical packages treats them differently.

Which of the following approaches best addresses the testability concerns while maintaining the functionality?\n\nA) Keep the class static but add a mock implementation for testing purposes:\n```csharp\npublic static class FileHelper\n{\n    private static IFileHelper _instance = new RealFileHelper();\n    \n    public static void SetMockForTesting(IFileHelper mock)\n    {\n        _instance = mock;\n    }\n\n    public static void ExtractZipFile(Stream zipStream, string location)\n    {\n        _instance.ExtractZipFile(zipStream, location);\n    }\n    // Other methods...\n}\n```\n\nB) Convert the static class to a singleton:\n```csharp\npublic class FileHelper\n{\n    private static FileHelper _instance = new FileHelper();\n    public static FileHelper Instance => _instance;\n\n    private FileHelper() { }\n\n    public void ExtractZipFile(Stream zipStream, string location)\n    {\n        // Implementation\n    }\n    // Other methods...\n}\n```\n\nC) Make the class non-static, extract an interface, and use dependency injection:\n```csharp\npublic interface IFileHelper\n{\n    void ExtractZipFile(Stream zipStream, string location);\n    // Other method signatures...\n}\n\npublic class FileHelper : IFileHelper\n{\n    public void ExtractZipFile(Stream zipStream, string location)\n    {\n        // Implementation\n    }\n    // Other methods...\n}\n\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    private readonly IFileHelper _fileHelper;\n\n    public MyClass(IFileHelper fileHelper)\n    {\n        _fileHelper = fileHelper;\n    }\n    // Usage of _fileHelper...\n}\n```\n\nD) Keep the class static but use a service locator pattern:\n```csharp\npublic static class FileHelper\n{\n    private static IFileHelper _instance = ServiceLocator.Resolve<IFileHelper>();\n\n    public static void ExtractZipFile(Stream zipStream, string location)\n    {\n        _instance.ExtractZipFile(zipStream, location);\n    }\n    // Other methods...\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best approach for improving testability. By making the class non-static, extracting an interface, and using dependency injection, we achieve several benefits:\n\n1. The class can be easily mocked in unit tests.\n2. It follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, allowing for better decoupling.\n3. It enables easier substitution of implementations, improving flexibility.\n4. It makes the dependencies of a class explicit through constructor injection.\n\nWhile options A and D attempt to introduce some level of testability, they still rely on global state and don't fully solve the issues associated with static classes. Option B (singleton) doesn't significantly improve testability and can introduce its own set of problems. Option C provides the most flexible and testable solution while maintaining the original functionality."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/11", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/184434", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/69062/"], "docs_id": 184434, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I select several points in a buffer to just each buffer them and among them to choose a point that has the highest elevation using ArcMap? \n\nEach point can be in several buffer and as each buffer can have multiple points.\n\nI have many points that has elevation and I want to remove some points that are too close together.

An occupancy is a single tenant, within reason. For instance a single family home gets one service. If that house is later subdivided into four apartments, it *could* have four meters and four services, but the power company will be reluctant to provision all this, so they will insist on proof that the city authorized the subdivision.\n\nSimilarly, a large building subdivided into live\\-work spaces, workshops, studios or retail stores may be able to get a separate utility meter and service for each tenancy. \n\nAlternately, the landlord can take one service, and fit his own \"submeters\" and then rebill the tenants. \n\nSo what happens when the 4\\-unit apartments are turned back into a single family home? Awkward. The power company may be able to bill them on one bill. Electrically, you have to live with it, and keep each service's hots, neutrals and grounds separate. If you've got four 60A services and want to fit a heat pump with a 70A aux heat, you've got a problem. \n\n---\n\n**You can't feed one main panel from two meters.** (unless the power company specifically wires you up that way, and remember, the point of demarcation isn't the meter, it's below the meter, and in that case, it would be on them). This would be paralleling without using equipment made for paralleling, and would raise huge issues for overcurrent protection, maintenance shut\\-off, and finding main panels able to support merging main feeds (you won't). And if any of the services are out of phase with each other \\-\\- KABOOM! That last is why even if you were do this harebrained idea, you'd want overcurrent protection *before* the merge. \n\nWhat you can do is install one new, proper main service (e.g. 200A) with one main panel. Then later at your leisure, cut over each old panel to be a subpanel of the new main. If you are in Europe, the new main could be 3\\-phase and serve a single phase to each subpanel. So for instance, in that case, you'd provision your heat pump's 70A aux heat directly off the new main, bypassing the subpanels altogether. You could cut loads over to the new main at your leisure, and eventually deprecate the old panels. But \\-\\- \n\nJust to sanity check here, are you sure the building's best value isn't subdivided? If so, take care to arrange things so a rollback is possible. If so, the plan might be leave the subpanels intact, and go with submetering if that day ever comes."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A building owner wants to combine electrical services for a property that was previously divided into multiple units. Which of the following approaches is both safe and compliant with typical electrical codes?\n\nA) Install a new main panel that is fed directly from two separate utility meters to increase available power\nB) Connect the outputs of multiple existing meters in parallel to feed a single main panel\nC) Install a new 200A main service and panel, then gradually convert old panels to subpanels fed from the new main\nD) Leave all existing services in place but install a device to electronically combine their power before the main panel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct and safe approach. Installing a new main service and panel, then gradually converting old panels to subpanels, allows for proper overcurrent protection and avoids the dangers of paralleling separate services. Option A violates the rule of one meter per occupancy and creates safety issues. Option B is extremely dangerous, risking equipment damage and fire from potential phase mismatches. Option D is not a real solution and would still involve unsafe paralleling of services.

This is supported by several factors:\n\n1. The services could be started manually, indicating that the configuration and binaries were correct.\n2. The issue affected multiple services (HAProxy and Docker), suggesting a system-wide problem rather than a service-specific one.\n3. The problem resolved itself over time without intervention, which is consistent with a rogue process eventually terminating or releasing resources.\n4. The error messages indicate that the processes were exiting abnormally (core-dump), which could be caused by resource conflicts.\n\nOption A is unlikely as hardware issues typically don't resolve themselves so quickly and cleanly. Option C is possible but less likely, as systemd issues usually require intervention to resolve. Option D is improbable because configuration files don't typically self-repair, and corrupted configs would likely prevent manual starts as well.\n\nThe correct troubleshooting step, as suggested in

Strictly speaking, magnetic dipole is a collection of two magnetic poles with non\\-zero magnetic dipole moment (the Coulomb magnetic moment). It is a useful model of a magnet from the Coulomb theory of magnetostatics, where magnetic field *can* do work on magnetic poles; in this theory, force on physical magnetic dipole made of two particles with magnetic pole charge $q,\\-q$ at positions $\\\\mathbf r\\_1,\\\\mathbf r\\_2$ is\n\n$$\n\\\\mathbf F \\= q \\\\bigg(\\\\mathbf H(\\\\mathbf r\\_1\\) \\-\\\\mathbf H(\\\\mathbf r\\_2\\) \\\\bigg).\n$$\nDeriving the formula for potential energy for such a dipole in magnetic field\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\nis easy, the derivation is just like that for potential energy of an electric dipole in external field in electrostatics.\n\nWhen you ask how\n\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\n\nis consistent with the idea that magnetic field cannot do work on charged particles (due to the Lorentz formula), you are asking about *magnetic moment* that is due to a current loop, not about magnetic moment due to magnetic dipole (which belongs to the theory above).\n\n**Energy of magnetic moment in external magnetic field**\n\nThe potential energy formula\n\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\n\nis still valid in a limited sense for systems where the magnetic moment $\\\\mathbf m$ is due to a current loop, but it is harder to derive. It is easier to derive it in special cases, such as magnetic moment due to loop of current.\n\n**Work of external forces on a current loop in changing external magnetic field**\n\nConsider a planar current loop, placed in an external field $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$ that we can control. Let the loop be in unstable position in the magnetic field (held in place by some external forces), so that magnetic field is $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,1}$ (rougly in the direction of the $z$\\-axis), the current is $I\\_1$ (negative), $\\\\mathbf S \\= A\\\\mathbf e\\_z$ is the surface area vector of the circuit, and magnetic moment is $\\\\mathbf m\\_1 \\= I\\_1 \\\\mathbf S \\= I\\_1 A \\\\mathbf e\\_z$ (roughly of opposite orientation to the magnetic field).\n\nThen during a small time interval $\\\\Delta t$ we slowly increase the external magnetic field by a little to a value $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,2} \\= \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,1} \\+ \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$.\n\nDue to this change, during that time the current will experience induced electric field due to external sources $\\\\mathbf E\\_{i,ext}$ and entire circuit will experience induced EMF that boosts the current in the original direction. As this proceeds, the external induced electric field will do work on the current, and since this is a conservative system, this work will get stored in the system (as increased magnetic energy). So we can use this work to define potential energy:\n\n$$\n\\\\text{increase of potential energy when going from state 1 to state 2} :\\= $$\n$$\n\\\\text{work of external induced electric force on the current}.\\\\tag{\\*\\*}\n$$\n\nFormally\n\n$$\nE\\_{p,2} \\- E\\_{p,1} \\= \\\\Delta W.\n$$\n\nWe can express the work done as function of magnetic field and magnetic moment of the current loop. The procedure could be as follows.\n\nWork done during $\\\\Delta t$ can be expressed as the product\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext} I\\_1 \\\\Delta t\n$$\nwhere $\\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext}$ is external induced EMF. This is, due to Faraday's law, equal to minus rate of change of magnetic flux due to external magnetic field through the circuit:\n\n$$\n\\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext} \\= \\- \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf S}{\\\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nCombining the two last equations, we get\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\- \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf S I\\_1\\.\n$$\n\nHowever the circuit has, initially, the magnetic moment\n\n$$\n\\\\mathbf m\\_1 \\= I\\_1 \\\\mathbf S.\n$$\n\nSo the work done is\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\- \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf m\\_1\\.\n$$\n\n**Defining potential energy for a \"frozen\" magnetic moment**\n\nIf the current loop system is such that current (and thus also magnetic moment) stays almost the same during all the changes of external field we do, we can approximate and say the only changing term on the right\\-hand side of work done (above) is the external magnetic field. This may be the case when there is already a much greater current in the system than the current changes we can cause by the external magnetic field. Then we can define the following potential energy function of the external magnetic field:\n\n$$\nE\\_p (\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}) \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}. \\\\tag{\\*}\n$$\n\nAs long as $\\\\mathbf m$ changes only negligibly during all changes of magnetic field we do, this potential energy obeys (\\*\\*). This is somewhat applicable to a ferromagnet in a weak external magnetic field. Its magnetization and magnetization current is almost \" frozen\" and changes only very little due to weak external field.\n\n**The correct potential energy for the current loop in perfect conductor**\n\nThe potential energy derived above *is not* valid for an ordinary current loop when the current is entirely induced by changes in external magnetic field.\n\nIn general, if the magnetic moment changes are partially non\\-conservative (e.g. the changes of magnetic moment produce some heat inside), then there is no potential energy that can be defined.\n\nHowever, if our current loop system is conservative (perfect conductor), exact potential energy function can still be derived. We start with the expression for work done during infinitesimal change:\n\n$$\nd W \\= \\- d\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf m.\n$$\n\nNow, if both $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$ and $\\\\mathbf m$ were functions of the same quantity, we could integrate this and find the correct potential energy function.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's second circuital law applied to perfect conductor, we have\n\n$$\n\\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext} \\+ \\\\mathscr{E}\\_{self} \\= 0,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{dB}{dt} A \\= \\- L\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $L$ is self\\-inductance of the circuit and $B$ is normal component of $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$ effective in calculating the magnetic flux. From this and the initial condition $I\\=0, B\\=0$ we find that magnetic field is a function of current:\n$$\nB \\= \\- \\\\frac{L}{A}I.\n$$\nSimilarly, magnetic moment magnitude is function of current $m \\= IA$. So now we can express the work done as\n\n$$\ndW \\= d\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{1}{2}L I^2\\\\bigg)\n$$\nwhich suggests that potential energy is\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\\\frac{1}{2}L I^2\\.\n$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of external field and magnetic moment:\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}.\n$$\nThis energy expression is half of that given by the sought\\-for formula (\\*). The different factor is due to fact that during the process of increase of magnetic field, magnetic moment in\n\n$$\n\\- \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf m\n$$\nis built up from zero. Work on zero or very small magnetic moment as field changes by $\\\\Delta B\\_{ext}$ is almost zero, but in the end, work on the final magnetic moment is much larger. Magnetic moment is a linear function of the external magnetic field, so net work is one half of the product of the final values."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A circular current loop with area A and current I is placed in an external magnetic field B_ext.

The partial likelihood is a ratio of hazards among those who fail and those who live on at each failure time: (individuals in the \"risk set\"). If you write out the math, you'll see that the baseline hazard function cancels out and so you get partial likelihood contributions that do not vary as a function of time. \n\nThe one wrinkle about information regarding times is the specification of the risk set: this is why only the ordering of event times matters... this is what compelled Cox to call it a *partial* likelihood and not a *conditional* likelihood. When you think of the interpretation of the $p$\\-value, you consider the event times as given, but permutations of which individuals fail when is the only contribution to \"randomness\" in the sample.\n\nThe partial likelihood behaves much like a regular likelihood and can be maximized to obtain estimates of time\\-invariant hazard ratios."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the Cox proportional hazards model, why is the ordering of event times sufficient, rather than the exact time points?\n\nA) The model assumes that hazards are constant over time, making exact time points irrelevant.\nB) The partial likelihood approach cancels out the baseline hazard function, relying only on the ordering of events.\nC) The Cox model is not actually time-dependent, but rather event-dependent.\nD) Exact time points are used, but they are transformed into ranks before analysis.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Cox proportional hazards model uses a partial likelihood approach, which is a key feature that allows it to work with just the ordering of event times rather than exact time points. This approach involves calculating the ratio of hazards among those who experience the event and those who survive at each failure time. When you write out the mathematics, the baseline hazard function cancels out in this ratio. As a result, the partial likelihood contributions do not vary as a function of time, but rather depend on the ordering of events. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Cox model does not assume constant hazards over time; in fact, it allows for a time-varying baseline hazard.\n\nOption C is misleading. While the model does focus on events, it is still fundamentally a time-to-event model, just one that doesn't require exact time measurements.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The times are not transformed into ranks; rather, only the order of events matters in the calculation of the partial likelihood.\n\nThe correct answer, B, captures the essence of why the Cox model can work with just the ordering of events: the partial likelihood approach mathematically eliminates the need for exact time points while still allowing for estimation of hazard ratios."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/12", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/82129", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/28354/"], "docs_id": 82129, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Mechanical Engineering Master Thesis about positioning control of a pneumatic system with Model Predictive Control. I am primarily an electrical engineer and i do not know much about electronics. I need to design an interface card in order to connect a valve (5/3 way), two pressure sensors, a linear scale to my NI\\-PCI\\-6010 data acquisition card.\n\nI have a bunch of questions about them. I tried to find solutions about them but none of them is enough for me. I wish you can help me.\n\nHowever proportional valve (<http://xdki.festo.com/xdki/data/doc_ENGB/PDF/EN/MPYE_EN.PDF>) needs to be driven with 4\\-20 mA, my PCI\\-6010 card (<http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/371498a.pdf>) doesn't support it as i understand. Its analog output have a range of \\-5 to \\+5 V, i need to convert it into 4\\-20 mA.\n\nFirst of all, do I need to convert \\-\\+5V or can I use 0\\-5V instead? I have seen lots of voltage\\-to\\-current converters in other websites, but all of them is about converting 1\\-5 V to 4\\-20 mA, I think there is an offset problem for 0\\-5V. I have found a non\\-inverting summing amplifier that can do what I want, but when input voltage reaches 5V, output current reaches 20,496 mA and this is surely a problem, also i need linearity.\n\nI have found an IC that can convert 0\\-5 V to 4\\-20 mA (XTR110, I think you all have a word to say about it), but I cannot wait to purchase it, because i couldn't find any distributor in my country. So that I want to design a PCB in order to get over this problem.\n\nAlso I don't want to use a passive voltage\\-to\\-current converter. Here is the circuit I designed.\n\n![0-5 V to 4-20 mA Converter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKRne.png)\n\nV1 \\= 5 V, Vref \\= 1 V (for offset problem)\n\nAlso; when V1 \\= 0V, output current is 4,037 mA.

OAs ( Operational Amplifier) are good for Voltage gain and High impedance output, but not to \"play\" with current, the current output is sensible with the components tolerance. Try to simulate your circuits with variation of 5% in your devices (resistors \\& VCC) and see the output. When you will buy the components they will have deviations about 1% to 5%, depend on the quality of the materials you will buy.\n\nTransistors are the devices to play with current gains, but impedance could be the problem. \n\nSee also the tolerance for the Valve mid\\-position for current, it is 1\\.3%:\n\n```\nVoltage type [V DC] 5 (\u00b10.1)\nCurrent type [mA] 12 (\u00b10.16)\n\n```\n\nYour are right the 12\\.267 mA are not correct ( max. acceptable would be 12\\.16 mA), take this into consideration because it means: **the tolerance current output of your circuit must be max. 1\\.3%!!!.**\n\nIt could means also that maybe temperature compensation of your output must be implemented depend on the range of temperature where the device will operate and ICs you will use.\n\nI have seen the Page 6 Datasheet of the valve: \n\n```\nSetpoint value\nVoltage type [V DC] 0 \u2026 10\nCurrent type [mA] 4 \u2026 20\n\n```\n\nWhy don't you try to control the valve with \"Voltage type\"? I think it is easier to transform your \\+\\-5V to a 0\\-10 Volt linear signal with mid\\-position on 5V. And you have a little more tolerance (2%) requirement for your output. It is easy, you can use an OA adder with a two inputs: one a \\+5V offset and the second your \\+\\-5V signal (you must check the tolerance)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an interface to control a pneumatic valve using a data acquisition card.

This is suggested because:\n\n1. It's easier to transform the -5 to +5V signal to 0-10V using a simple op-amp adder circuit.\n2.

Much of it involves ugly math (summations involving exponential functions). I'm going to try to distill the theory to basics, then apply it to your question.\n\nFirst off we need some definitions:\n\n* Service \\- A general class of resource that provides work\n* Instance \\- An individual worker for a service\n* Pool \\- The number of available workers\n* Request \\- A work unit that needs servicing\n* Queue \\- The ordered list of requests awaiting servicing\n* Job \\- A request being actively serviced by a service instance\n* Runtime \\- The time is takes for an instance to service a job\n* Limit \\- A resource constraint on an instance that can place a ceiling on runtime\n* Exception \\- A failure in the processing of the request\n\nNow to put them into common context:\n\nYou're due to fly out on an international flight. You have baggage and an economy ticket. You locate your airline, and join the group of folks waiting to check in. There are three slightly harried airline representatives beyond the eight people ahead of you, and two of the three have customers they're already checking in. As you wait, you notice that customers leave the front at an average of one minute per person, plus 45 seconds for each checked bag.\n\nUnder this content, when you first arrived you have a service (airline check\\-in) with three server instances (pool size three), eleven requests, with queue length nine, two active jobs, and a runtime proportional to the number of seats *plus* bags.\n\nThere are ways to speed you on your way:\n\n* The airline could hire a dozen more check\\-in specialists. This would provide more instances, and therefore more completed jobs per unit time. But the extra salary would increase costs to the point that fares tripled, and your holiday might fall victim.\n* The airline could limit two persons and three bags per job (which would also yield also more jobs/time) but you probably want to keep both your spouse and infant daughter on the flight with you (getting kicked out of the line would be a service exception, as would still being in the queue when your flight announced final boarding).\n\nLet's say that there just happens to be an additional check\\-in specialist, who was on break. This individual walks up to an open podium, logs in with two\\-factor authentication, flips some switches to make the light turn on, and calls to the next person in line. Now you've experienced service pooling \\-\\- the worker was available, but it took a bit to spin up to become an instance.\n\nIn the GIS realm, the same principles can be applied, but let's describe the system based on the load you've described (assuming a one\\-min, two\\-max service list defaults):\n\nYou are running an airport with 100 airlines and 100 two\\-position check\\-in terminals, with 100 representatives at lit check\\-in stations, and 100 extra staffers in the back room to take on additional work (one per airline). We don't know how often a flyer comes in, or to which airline, or whether any representatives are busy, or how profitable the airport is that it can afford to have so many workers sitting around waiting for not enough customers. We do know that planes are leaving without passengers on occasion.\n\nWould increasing the number of back\\-room staffers for one airline help prevent unhappy flyers? Well, maybe for that one airline, but in the context of the airport, probably not.\n\nWhat you need to do is:\n\n* Identify which services are consistently busy, and which are usually idle\n* Reduce minimum pool from those that are often idle\n* Add maximum pool size to the busiest services, highest queue length first (but add slowly, no more than half the backlog at a time; workers are expensive)\n* If requests to certain servers are of short duration, and extremely bursty, it might make sense to increase the minimum number of instances, to reduce the latency of spinning up pooled instances\n* Review and repeat as necessary\n\nIn the end, you only have so many resources, and it's not clear what the error might be. An expensive way to find out if your error is due to resource exhaustion is to double the capacity of the server (2x CPU and/or 2x RAM), or double the number of servers (the latter increases overhead cost, due to additional communication, but also provides a means to continue servicing during maintenance windows). The less expensive options all involve more work, since you'd need to do some research into queuing theory and review the practical aspects of your deployment in light of this theory. In between might be a short\\-term consult from a expert to review your configuration and make recommendations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS service is experiencing performance issues due to high demand.

I cannot envisage how it's used in old\\-day English or in fun. Perhaps I'm short of some imagination (a few GIF pictures could make for a better understanding). Those bolded parts are not specific enough for me. Please help to clarify them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Calling it stagey or theatrical might be going a bit too far, but this usage is fairly restricted. The places I can see it being used are for adding emphasis and for giving instructions. It's entirely possible that there are more that I haven't thought of, but these came to mind.\n\nFor dramatic effect:  \n\n> John and Steve are running a foot race and are neck and neck right up to the finish line, when John pulls ahead by an eyelash. John cries out, \"I win!\"  \n> \n>   \n> \n>  Sam has been struggling with chemistry for hours, but with Sue's help he finally has a moment of understanding and excitedly says, \"I get it!\" in triumph.\n>    \n>   \n> \n>  Sam continues working with more success, but Sue continues to treat him as if he doesn't understand any of the material. Eventually he snaps at her, annoyed, \"I get it!\"\n\nFor conveying instructions, as in a demonstration:\n\n> I am showing my daughter how to tie her shoes; we each have a shoe. I say, \"First I cross the strings. Next I wrap one end around...\"  \n>   \n> \n>  I am showing my chemistry students how to use a separatory funnel correctly. I say, \"First I pour the mixture into the funnel, then I stopper it. Next I invert it and open the stopcock to vent gases...\"  \n>   \n> \n>  Instructing a new dishwasher: \"We wash the dishes, rinse them with clean water, dry them, then put them away in their proper spots.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the appropriate use of the simple present tense for dramatic effect or instruction?\n\nA) It is commonly used in everyday conversation to describe ongoing actions.\nB) It is primarily used in old-fashioned theatrical language and is rarely seen in modern English.\nC) It can be used for emphasis in moments of triumph or realization, and for giving step-by-step instructions.\nD) It should always be accompanied by an exclamation mark in writing to convey its dramatic nature.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The simple present tense can indeed be used for dramatic effect or instruction, but its use is more nuanced than the other options suggest. Option A is incorrect because the progressive tense (e.g., \"I am opening\") is more common for describing ongoing actions in everyday conversation. Option B overstates the tense's association with theatrical language and understates its modern usage. Option D is too prescriptive; while an exclamation mark might sometimes be appropriate, it's not always necessary.\n\nOption C correctly captures two key uses of the simple present tense for dramatic effect:\n1) In moments of triumph or sudden realization (e.g., \"I win!\" or \"I get it!\")\n2) When giving step-by-step instructions or demonstrations (e.g., \"First I cross the strings. Next I wrap one end around...\")\n\nThese uses align with the examples provided in the explanation about dramatic effect and conveying instructions."}}
