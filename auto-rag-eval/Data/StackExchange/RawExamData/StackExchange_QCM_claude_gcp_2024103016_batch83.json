I know 1/2 inch is strong enough, but I was thinking more of the nailing. Anyway... it's installed.\n\nI plan to install Tyvek 200 underlayment using 3/4\" cap nails, and 1\\-1/2\" cap nails where the joists are.\n\nFor the PBR I have the same, 1\\-1/2\" metal to wood screws for the joists, and 3/4 for the metal to metal ribs, so I don't see any protrusions there unless I don't hit a joist which is possible.\n\nSince it's a carport, of course when you look up at the bottom, you will see any screws protruding out. There will be quite a few. I guess I could live with them if I had to but I don't really want to.\n\n**Question:** Is it OK to cut off (*either with my cutters or rotary tool*) the tips of any protruding screws or nails? Will it hurt the \"holding power?\"\n\nFYI i am in Los Angeles. We don't get hurricanes etc. I looked at the high wind history for the last 20 years and it never got above 35 MPH.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: After chatting with my contractor buddy, I just decided to use normal 1\\.5 cap nails only where the joists are, which are 16 OC. Any other places that need it I will just use Tack 1/2 Staples.I will also tape the edges down with my fantastic 3M flashing tape to the drip edge I will have nailed down.

This approach provides adequate fastening at structural points (joists) while minimizing visible fasteners from below. The use of staples between joists allows for additional securing of the underlayment without protruding through the plywood. This method balances the need for proper attachment with aesthetic concerns, particularly important for a carport where the underside is visible. Additionally, taping the edges with flashing tape to the drip edge provides extra security without adding visible fasteners."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/13", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/238890", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/130143/"], "docs_id": 238890, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've the following Interface.\n\n```\npublic interface ValueInterface\n{\n  long  getValue();\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd the class:\n\n```\npublic class ValueCreator implements ValueInterface\n{\n  private static long value  = 0;\n\n  public void setValue(long valueInDollar)\n  {\n    value= valueInDollar;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public long getValue()\n  {\n    return value;\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe static code analyzer findbugs warned me not to set a static field in a non\\-static method.

Here is how `addError`, `addSuccess`, `addNotice`, `addWarning` work.  \n\nThe message you give as a parameter for those methods are added to the session.  \n\nwhen a page is viewed, Magento checks in the session for any messages.  \n\nIf there are any, they are displayed and removed from the session. \n\nSo when you do an action (like refreshing cache types for example) and the action is finished, but the redirect is not complete, it means you will have the messages in the session already and refreshing any other page will display them and remove them from session. \n\nI don't think there is a way to \"fix\" this.

When a success message (or any other type of message) is added to the session using methods like addSuccess() or addError(), it is stored in the session data. When any admin page is loaded, Magento checks the session for pending messages. If found, these messages are displayed and then removed from the session.\n\nIn the scenario described, if you perform an action on one page (like refreshing caches) that adds a success message to the session, but then quickly refresh a different admin page before the original page has completed its refresh, the success message will appear on the second page. This happens because the message is already in the session, and the second page load retrieves and displays it before the first page has a chance to do so.\n\nThis behavior can also occur on the frontend if a user navigates quickly enough between pages. While it may seem counterintuitive, it's part of how Magento handles session-based messaging across the entire admin (and frontend) interface."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/13", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/3974", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/270/"], "docs_id": 3974, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have a kitchen mixer tap something like the one below.

The documentation provides the optimal orientation vector u = [1,2,...,2^(d-1)]/\u221a(1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (2^(d-1))^2), which can be simplified to \u221a(3/(4^d-1))[1,2,...,2^(d-1)].

A good beginner's access to OOP is often *\"start with objects representing things from the real world\"*, that is true. \n\nHowever, you **should not stop with this**!\n\nClasses can (and should) be used to structure your program in various ways. Modeling objects from the real world is one aspect of this, but not the only one. Creating modules or components for a specific task is another sensible use case for classes. A \"feature extractor\" is probably such a module, and even it contains only one **public** method `extract_features()`, I would be astonished if if does not also contain a lot of private methods and maybe some shared state. So having a class `FeatureExtractor` will introduce a natural location for these private methods.\n\n*Side note: in languages like Python which support a separate module concept one can also use a module `FeatureExtractor` for this, but in the context of this question, this is IMHO a negligible difference.*\n\nMoreover, a \"feature extractor\" can be imagined as \"a person or bot which extracts features\". That is an abstract \"thing\", maybe not a thing you will find in the real world, but the name itself is a useful abstraction, which gives everyone a notion of what the responsibility of that class is. So I disagree that this class does not \"represent anything\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In object-oriented programming, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the creation and use of classes?\n\nA) Classes should only represent concrete objects from the real world and nothing else.\n\nB) Classes should always have multiple public methods to be considered properly designed.\n\nC) Classes can be used to structure programs in various ways, including modeling real-world objects and creating modules for specific tasks.\n\nD) Creating a class for a single-method operation like feature extraction is against SOLID principles and should be avoided.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. While it's common for beginners to start by modeling real-world objects as classes, this is not the only valid use for classes in object-oriented programming. Classes can and should be used to structure programs in various ways, including creating modules or components for specific tasks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because classes are not limited to representing only concrete real-world objects.

A well-designed class can have a single public method if that's all that's needed to fulfill its role.\n\nOption D is incorrect because creating a class for a specific task, even if it has only one public method, can be a valid design choice.

If you don't have the proper tools and/or knowledge, it's often best to let the professionals handle maintenance and repair.*\n\nGas Furnace Ignition Sequence:\n==============================\n\n1.

Main burners ignite.\n10. Blower timer starts.\n11. Flame sensor detects main burner flame.\n12. Blower starts.\n\nIgnition Problems:\n==================\n\nVacuum Switch Not Closing\n-------------------------\n\nIn a high efficiency furnace, if the vacuum switch does not close after a certain timeout. The furnace will shut down, then possibly retry a few times depending on model. If after a given number of tries the switch still does not close, the furnace will enter lock out. Once in lock out, the furnace has to be manually reset (depending on model).\n\nThe vacuum switch will look something like this...\n\n![Vacuum switch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JuyoF.jpg)\n\nAnd will have a rubber tube connecting it to the draft inducer. This part cannot be repaired, and must be replaced if it's faulty.\n\nPilot Not Igniting\n------------------\n\nIf the pilot does not light, you'll first want to check to make sure there is something trying to ignite it. Typically a spark or glow ignitor is used, so first you'll want to determine which is being used.\n\n### Glow Ignitor\n\nA glow ignitor looks similar to this, though may not be visible without further disassembly.\n\n![Glow ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3OVd.jpg)\n\nIt works by passing a current through it, causing it to heat up and glow. It should heat up enough to ignite the pilot gas. If it doesn't heat up, it should be replaced.\n\n### Spark Ignitor\n\nA spark ignitor looks like this.\n\n![Spark Ignitor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KugBz.jpg)\n\nTake notice of the thick, often orange or red wire that is typically used to connect the ignitor to the ignition control module. This device works by generating an electrical arc between the two probes, causing the pilot gas to ignite. If there is no spark, you'll have to replace the ignition control module and/or the ignitor itself. If the [ignitor is not igniting the gas](https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/32529/33), but there is a spark. You can try cleaning the electrodes with fine steel wool, to remove any carbon buildup.\n\nPilot Not Proving\n-----------------\n\nFor a pilot to \"prove\", it simply means that the flame sensor has sensed the pilot flame. If there is no pilot or the sensor doesn't detect it, the furnace will often purge the system and then try again. Furnaces will often try a set number of times, before entering lock out.\n\nIf you can see the pilot flame, but the sensor is not detecting it. Try gently cleaning the sensor with fine steel wool, to remove any built up carbon. Also make sure the sensor is in the proper location with respect to the flame (Check the owners manual for proper placement), and adjust as necessary. If that doesn't work, replace the sensor.\n\nMain Burner Not Proving\n-----------------------\n\nIf the main burner ignites, but the furnace shuts down before the blower starts. You'll want to check the main flame (or rollout, high limit, etc) sensor(s). If your furnace has error code indicators, check those and compare to the owners manual for translation. In this case, you'll want to test and/or replace each sensor and/or contact an HVAC technician"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a high efficiency gas furnace, what component is responsible for detecting negative pressure and must close before the ignition sequence can continue?\n\nA) Flame sensor\nB) Vacuum switch\nC) Pilot valve\nD) Draft inducer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The vacuum switch is a crucial component in high efficiency gas furnaces. It detects the negative pressure created by the draft inducer. If the vacuum switch does not close after the draft inducer starts, the furnace will not proceed with the ignition sequence. This is step 3 in the high efficiency gas furnace ignition sequence as described in the documentation. The vacuum switch cannot be repaired and must be replaced if faulty. Other options, while important parts of the furnace, do not perform this specific function of detecting negative pressure and allowing the sequence to continue."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/859446", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/423417/"], "docs_id": 859446, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have 2 forests \\- domainA.com and domainB.net.

What does it intuitively mean? If one is to explain this to their child how would one go about it?\n\nIt's a concept that I have difficulty in articulating \\- especially when relating variance to risk. I understand it mathematically and can explain it that way too. But when explaining real world phenomena how do you make one understand variance and it's applicability in the 'real world', so to speak.\n\nLet's say we are simulating an investment in a stock using random numbers (rolling a die or using an excel sheet, doesn't matter). We get some 'return on investment' by associating each instance of the random variable to 'some change' in the return.

This increased dispersion of cards corresponds to a higher variance in their distances from the release point. \n\nIn Trial 1, the cards are dropped from a lower height, giving them less opportunity to spread out, which would result in a lower variance. This experiment provides an intuitive understanding of variance as a measure of spread or dispersion in a dataset.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the height and method of release significantly affect the spread of the cards.

However, this configuration is essential for proper circuit operation. When the power supply is connected correctly, the MOSFET is held on and conducts with low resistance in both directions. More importantly, this orientation ensures that the MOSFET's body diode is reverse-biased during normal operation. If the polarity is reversed, the body diode remains reverse-biased, and the MOSFET turns off, preventing current flow and protecting the circuit.

As patents often are, this one is written in such a generic manner as to apply to any different type of tunneling protocol, from what I can tell.\n\nThe payload of this encapsulated traffic would be opaque to the any firewall at the network on the other end of the tunnel. Presumably, these encapsulated packets would be passed through unfiltered to the internal host where the other end of the tunnel terminated. That host would receive the traffic, pass it through its own firewall, decapsulate the traffic (if allowed by its own firewall), and pass the decapsulated packets back its firewall. When the packet travels thru the firewall the second time (after decapsulation), it has an \"this packet traversed the network edge\" bit set such that only rules with the \"edge traversal\" bit also set will apply to the packet.\n\nFigure 4 of that patent application appears to describe the process graphically, and the \"Detailed Descriptions\" section beginning on page 7 describes the process in painfully specific detail.\n\nThis basically permits a host\\-based firewall to have different rules for traffic that came in via a tunnel thru the local network's firewall, as opposed to traffic that was just sent unencapsulated by a tunnel directly through the local network's firewall.\n\nI wonder if the iptables \"mark\" functionality would be prior art to this patent? It certainly seems like it does a very similiar thing, albeit in an even more generic fashion (since you can write user\\-land code to \"mark\" packets for virtually any reason if you want to )."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the purpose of the \"Edge Traversal\" option in Advanced Windows Firewall on Windows Server 2008+?\n\nA) It allows services to be accessible across a NAT device without port forwarding\nB) It enables IPsec tunneling for all firewall rules\nC) It permits different firewall rules for traffic that came through tunnels versus direct unencapsulated traffic\nD) It automatically configures VPN connections when a machine is behind a router\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The \"Edge Traversal\" option allows the Windows Firewall to apply different rules to traffic that has been encapsulated and tunneled through the network edge, as opposed to traffic that arrives directly without encapsulation. This functionality is particularly useful for handling traffic from tunneling protocols, such as IPv6 to IPv4 tunnels. When enabled, it allows the host-based firewall to distinguish between and separately handle traffic that has traversed the network edge via a tunnel and traffic that has arrived through normal routing.

But when it comes the time to do riemannian geometry they leave all that nice machinery and just talk about the Riemann tensor, sectional curvature, Jacobi's equation and the first and second variations of engergy. \n\nSo, isn't there a way to tackle the classic problems in global riemannian geometry (for example the theorems that one can see in do Carmo's book) with Cartan's methods using moving frames? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Moving frames and differential forms are primarily useful for exact formal pointwise computations involving local differential invariants of a geometric structure (such as a Riemannian metric) and proving theorems that follow from such computations. An example might be the uniqueness of Riemannian metrics with constant sectional curvature. An impressive amount of differential geometry can be studied in this way, as shown in the work of Elie Cartan, S. S. Chern (see, for example, his papers generalizing Gauss\\-Bonnet and constructing Chern classes), and Robert Bryant.\n\nThe approach is less useful when working globally or semiglobally and when studying geometric inequalities rather than exact identities. The power of studying Jacobi fields along geodesics lies in the comparison theorems that originate in Sturm\\-Liouville theory. Here, formal computations are needed only to reduce the original geometric setup to a self\\-adjoint linear second order ODE, and the computations are best done with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal frame of vector fields (parallel along geodesics). The Cartan differential form approach is less convenient here.\n\nThe same is true when considering variational formulas for various energy integrals that are useful in differential geometry. It is possible to do the computation using differential forms and the formula for the Lie derivative, but for most of us find it more natural to work with vector fields and/or local co\\-ordinates when doing these computations.\n\nThe upshot, as I have already said elsewhere, is that I find it quite handy to be able to do computations using any of the different approaches and choose the one that feels most comfortable at any given moment."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages and limitations of using moving frames and differential forms in Riemannian geometry?\n\nA) Moving frames and differential forms are equally effective for both local computations and global geometric inequalities, making them the preferred method for all aspects of Riemannian geometry.\n\nB) The Cartan differential form approach is particularly useful for studying geometric inequalities and variational formulas, but less effective for exact formal pointwise computations.\n\nC) Moving frames and differential forms excel in exact formal pointwise computations and proving theorems based on local differential invariants, but are less convenient for global analyses and geometric inequalities.\n\nD) The study of Jacobi fields along geodesics is best approached using moving frames and differential forms, especially when dealing with comparison theorems derived from Sturm-Liouville theory.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the strengths and limitations of moving frames and differential forms in Riemannian geometry as described in the given text. These methods are indeed powerful for exact formal pointwise computations involving local differential invariants and for proving theorems that follow from such computations. However, they are less useful when working globally or semi-globally, and when studying geometric inequalities rather than exact identities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the universality of moving frames and differential forms, ignoring their limitations in global analyses.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the strengths and weaknesses of the Cartan differential form approach.

This is a non-trivial property that can be deduced from the integrality of the character table.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all permutations of order n are necessarily self-conjugate. \nOption B is too restrictive, as conjugacy extends beyond just the inverse.\nOption D is false because permutations of order n don't always form a single conjugacy class, especially for larger n.\n\nThis question tests understanding of group theory concepts, character tables, and their implications for conjugacy classes in symmetric groups."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/21", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/377092", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/2893/"], "docs_id": 377092, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there any formulas due to Ramanujan that have still not been proved\u2014or disproved?\n\nIf so, what are they?\n\nI believe this conjecture is due to Ramanujan and still open: if $x$ is a real number and $2^x$ and $3^x$ are both integers then $x$ is an integer.

The sed command used to introduce NUL characters is actually adding both a NUL character (\\0) and a newline character (\\n) at the end of each record.

With no authoritarian clues to guide us, I will indulge in some unfounded (but, I think, reasonable) speculation:\n\nMy personal guess would be that this is one of a group of words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic (since my knowledge of Scottish is quite rudimentary, I\u2019ll refer only to the Irish forms here\u2014it\u2019s quite a safe bet that most, if not all, of these also exist in some form or other in Scottish) that refer to something seen as tiny and insignificant, either something verbal or a physical object.\n\nThese words all start with *sm\\-* plus a vowel usually either /\u026a/ or /\u0250\\~\u0259/ and one more consonant. Most of the words are monosyllabic, with this consonant being then final, but some have an extra syllable, usually /\u0259/, /\u0259\u027e/, or /\u0259\u026b/ (these are all common nominal endings and are not part of the root of the word\u2014the latter two are non\\-productive diminutives).

It causes a preceding consonant\u2014i.e., the final consonant in the root or the final r/l in the suffix, if there is one\u2014to become slender if it isn\u2019t already (see [Irish phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_phonology#Consonants) for what broad and slender consonants are). Sometimes, this slenderisation is continued backwards to the root\\-final consonant even if there is a suffix, but not always; similarly, the schwa in the *\\-al/\\-ar* suffixes is sometimes deleted, sometimes not.\n\nAll the words listed above can be turned into diminutives very easily with this suffix, and quite a few of them would either coincide in Irish or be so similar that they would certainly coincide if borrowed into English:\n\n> *Smiog* \\> ***smig\u00edn***; *smiogal* \\> ***smiogail\u00edn/smigil\u00edn/smigl\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smid* and *smioda* \\> ***smid\u00edn***; *smaid* \\> ***smaid\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smiodar* and *smeadar* \\> ***smidir\u00edn*** (or sometimes *smidr\u00edn*)  \n> \n> *Smiot* \\> ***smit\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smut*, *smuta*, and *smuit* \\> ***smuit\u00edn***\n\nOf these, a few are common enough to have entered the dictionaries: *smidir\u00edn* \u2018tiny piece/scrap/fragment\u2019 (this is the source of the English word \u2018smithereens\u2019, as in \u2018blow something to smithereens\u2019); and *smit\u00edn* \u2018rap, smart blow as with a stump of wood\u2019.\n\nOf the others, I myself have certainly heard people using *smid\u00edn* and *smuit\u00edn* in regular speech in Irish to refer to little scraps of paper, pieces of dust, flecks of paints, specks of dandruff, smudges\u2014things like that.\n\nMy guess would be that \u2018smidgen\u2019 (and perhaps also \u2018smudge\u2019) in English comes from one or more of these diminutives and their source words. Both \u2018smidgen\u2019 and \u2018smudge\u2019 appear to have existed originally both with a final /d\u0292/ and a final /t\u0283/, which fits perfectly with being from a mixture of these words that also vacillate between final d and final t.\n\nIt appears from a bit of Googling that [this Reader\u2019s Digest PDF](http://media.rd.com/rd/consumer_marketing/Ultimate-Word-Power.pdf) gives a similar etymology, so I\u2019m not the first to advance this theory after all, it seems."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the likely origin of the English word \"smidgen\" according to the speculation in the text?\n\nA) It derives directly from the Scots word \"smitch\" without any intermediary forms.\n\nB) It comes from a Latin root meaning \"small\" that was adopted into English via Norman French.\n\nC) It evolved from one or more Irish/Scottish Gaelic diminutive forms of words starting with \"sm-\" that refer to small things or amounts.\n\nD) It originated as an onomatopoeic word in Middle English to represent the sound of something tiny.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The text speculates that \"smidgen\" likely comes from Irish or Scottish Gaelic diminutive forms of words starting with \"sm-\" that refer to small things or amounts.

In a diatomic molecule, when considering the ground state with zero angular momentum, the wavefunction is invariant under rotations. This leads to delocalization in the angular dimension, meaning the absolute positions of the nuclei are smeared out rotationally. However, the internuclear distance (the modulus of R) is well-localized near the equilibrium position.

If the script is optional in a sequence of commands (like in `your-script && do-something-else`), returning 0 allows subsequent commands to run even if the user cancels.
