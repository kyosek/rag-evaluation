However, I don't get immediate feedback. Instead, I connect to wi\\-fi. However, wi\\-fi is both slower and less reliable than ethernet. Thus, I'd like to know whether I am connected to ethernet or not. Of course I can go into preferences and network settings to see whether I'm connected to ethernet, but it would be better if there was some form of indicator in the status bar, just as there is for wi\\-fi.\nThus, my question:\n\n**Is there a way of getting an indicator of ethernet connectivity in the OSX menu\\-bar?**\n\nPerhaps there is a free application that can do this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is Menumeters:\n\n* [menumeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) for OSX 10\\.10 and earlier\n* The port of [menumeters for OSX 10\\.11 onwards](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/).\n\nIf you go into the preferences for MenuMeters it is possible to add a network icon to the OSX menu bar.\nClicking on the icon, indicates the current network (i.e., wifi or Ethernet).\n\nThis is a reasonable solution, but it still requires you to click on the icon to see whether ethernet is connected."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator wants to monitor network connectivity on multiple Mac workstations running various versions of OSX.

What is the most appropriate solution to this problem?\n\nA) Manually enter a comma-separated list of attribute names in the \"Unique ID fields\" dropdown of the Dissolve algorithm configuration.\n\nB) Use the \"Dissolve all\" option in the Dissolve algorithm configuration to bypass the need for selecting specific attributes.\n\nC) Create a custom processing script that takes the intersected layer and key fields as inputs, then use this script in the model instead of the standard Dissolve algorithm.\n\nD) Modify the Graphical Modeler to allow dynamic population of the \"Unique ID fields\" dropdown based on the input layer's attributes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct solution is to create a custom processing script. This approach allows you to specify the input layer and key fields as parameters, which can then be connected to the model's inputs. The script uses these parameters to run the Dissolve algorithm with the correct fields, overcoming the limitation of the standard Dissolve algorithm in the Graphical Modeler where you can't directly select attributes from a dynamically generated input layer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because manually entering attribute names causes an error, as shown in the documentation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because using \"Dissolve all\" would not allow you to dissolve based on specific attributes from each input layer of the Intersection algorithm.\n\nOption D, while potentially useful, is not a current feature of the QGIS Graphical Modeler and would require significant modifications to the software."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/07/13", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/202011", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/24602/"], "docs_id": 202011, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm an archaeologist and I'm struggling with the generation of a reference coordinate system for georeferencing the *Spezialkarte der Osterreichisch\\-Ungarischen Monarchie* (XIX century).

But the net allocates over 1GB of RAM when I train it. What is all that memory needed for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I found out some of the factors that may contribute to the effect.\n\n1\\) At least in tiny\\-cnn, some of the buffers are allocated not once but once per **worker thread**. On a machine with **8** CPU threads, this can increase the memory usage a lot.\nIn debug mode using MS VC\\+\\+ 2015 the following two lines in the code base allocate a big chunk, both related to worker threads: [`ith_in_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L481) and [`ith_out_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L485).\n\n2\\) Additionally to the values for the neurons and weights listed in my question, also gradients and some other stuff for the backward passes and the optimization have to be stored.\n\n3\\) Not sure if this is relevant fot tiny\\-cnn, but many frameworks seem to use an operation called **im2col**. This makes the convolution much faster, by expressing it as a matrix multiplication. But in case of filters with 3\\*3 in height and width, this scales the number of values from the input to a convolution up by a factor of **9**.\nJustin Johnson explains it in the lecture [\"S231n Winter 2016 Lecture 11 ConvNets in practice\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue4RJdI8yRA) starting at 36:22\\.\n\n4\\) There was an **error in my initial calculation**. When a volume of 512\\*512\\*3 is convolved with 6 3\\*3 filters and then send into an average pooling layer, the result volume is 256\\*256\\*6, but in between it is 512\\*512\\*6, also contributing with a factor of **2**.\n\n5\\) There was **another error in my initial calculation**. I demonstrate it on the last conv layer (7\\). It takes a volume of 16\\*16\\*96 to a volume of 8\\*8\\*192 with filters of size 3\\*3\\. This means every filter has 3\\*3\\*96 weights, and there are 192 of them, resulting in 165888 (3\\*3\\*96\\*192\\) weights overall for this layer, not 6912\\.\n\nSo numerologically multiplying only the first three factors (8, 9 and 2\\) we end up with a factor of 144, which seems enough to explain the high memory consumption."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A convolutional neural network is designed for image processing with an input size of 512x512x3.

In the given setup, every maximal torus T \u2282 Z_G(S) is uniquely an isogenous product S \u00b7 T_0 for an anisotropic maximal torus T_0 \u2282 D(Z_G(S)).

The point cloud I'm testing against is very big (\\~800\\.000\\). However, this doesn't really explain why my implementation is so slow. This is my approach:\n\nFirst, I created a spatial index for the point shape \n\n`pntshp.ExecuteSQL('CREATE SPATIAL INDEX ON %s' % table_name)`\n\nI defined an array of buffer distances to narrow down the search radius. Which of course also means that I have to create a buffer for each point (which might be expensive). \n\n`BUFFER_DISTANCES = ( 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 ) # 100m, 500m, 1km, 2km, 5km` \n\nThen, the buffer is used as a spatial filter \n\n`node_lyr.SetSpatialFilter(buff)`\n\nIf the filter returns `None` the buffer distance will be increased. \n\n```\nfor buffer_d in BUFFER_DISTANCES:\n    buffr = get_buffer(xy_street,buffer_d)\n    ...\n\n```\n\nThen I am calculating the distance to the points returned by the spatial filter\n\n```\np=ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)\np.AddPoint(xy[0],xy[1])\n\nfor feat in node_lyr:\n    geom = feat.GetGeometryRef()\n    d = p.Distance(geom)\n    dist.append(d)       \n\n```\n\nTo get the closest point:\n\n```\ndef get_closest_pnt(dist, node, how_close):\n    mrg = zip(dist,node)\n    mrg.sort(key=lambda t: t[0])\n    try:\n        return mrg[how_close]\n    except IndexError, ierr:\n        print '%s \\ndist/node tuple contain %s' % (ierr,mrg)\n\n```\n\nIt all works fine but is really slow. Creating a spatial index didn't show any effect, really. To calculate 100 points this implementations takes \\~6,7 seconds. The program needs to be able to calculate the closest location for more than 2000 points as fast as possible. Any ideas on how to improve my approach? \n\n**EDIT**\n\nI tried different approaches to see where it gets me. I came across something very astonishing I want to share here. \n\nI implemented a simple lookup algorithm as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19154296/python-how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-a-set-the-fast-way), and one of the solutions that where suggested (the sorted set approach). \n\nThe surprising fact is that performance is not only dependent on the implementation but even more so of the OSX. My original ogr/buffer algorithm turns out to be blazing fast on my OSX whereas it is painstaking slow on Linux (hence the question here). \n\nHere are my results (100 runs). \n\n```\nMethod       |     OSX        |  Linux Ubuntu\nogr buffer   | 0:00:01.434389 | 0:01:08.384309\n\nsub string   | 0:00:19.714432 | 0:00:10.048649\n\nsorted set   | 0:00:01.239999 | 0:00:00.600773\n\nSpecs Mac OSX\nProcessor 4x2.5 GHz  \nMemory 8 GB 1600 MHz\n\nSpecs Dell Linux Ubuntu\nProcessor 8x3.4GHz\nMemory 7.8 GB\n\n```\n\nIf someone can explain why these differences occur, please don't hesitate. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Avoiding the spatial query**\n------------------------------\n\nSince you noted buffering is computationally expensive and may be holding you back, consider this approach: Start looping through each point and round off your lat long point to a decimal place within your buffer (i.e. if your lat/long is 12\\.3456789/12\\.3456789 then get all points that begin with a lat/long of 12\\.34567/12\\.34567 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34567/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34567\\). Use a [hash table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to do this. Take this subset of points, get all distances to your input point, and the point with minimum distance is the one you want. Creating a lookup methodology will make this very efficient.\n\nThis avoids having to do expensive spatial queries and query filter setup 800,000 times. You would only be doing string/double comparisons and distance calculations in this method. The only downside that I could see to this method is that each decimal roundoff is an order of magnitude above the last, so if your spatial query didn't return any points, rounding down again may return many more points than you need, which would slow you down a bit. However, you have at least two orders of magnitude in your orignal BUFFER\\_DISTANCES, so I think this method may suffice for your purposes and would certainly be faster than the method you have going right now.\n\n**The hash table:**\n-------------------\n\n[Here's](http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/algorithms/hash/article.php/c5131/Introduction-to-Hash-Tables.htm) a more concise and better introductory explanation to hash tables. \n\nThe concept is like so: You want to look up the definition for the word \"Yes\" in the dictionary. You don't look through every word in a dictionary starting from A to find the words that start with Ye, correct? You jump straight to the Y section first, then you look for the page that says Ye\\-Yo and then you scan all the words on that page to get the definition for Yes.\n\nThe lookup methodology to loop through all the lat/long points would be implemented in this same fashion. You'd look first for all the lat/longs that start with 12\\.3 in a range from, lets say 0 to 99\\. Then you'd look in those 10 values for 12\\.34, and so on. If programmed correctly, you can return a \"bucket\" with all of the points within your buffer, without having to execute a single spatial query or string/double comparison!\n\nFinally, it should be noted that if you store your indexed table in a RDBMS, there may be optimization for this already. If your lat/long values are doubles and do a simple [BETWEEN](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp) SQL query, it will likely have its search function [already optimized](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/557425/optimize-sql-that-uses-between-clause) to do this (if your query is written correctly)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: \n1.

Migrating directly to MySQL could be time-consuming and may be overkill for the current needs. SQLite offers a good compromise - it provides the benefits of a relational database (ACID compliance, SQL querying, etc.) while still being file-based and requiring no separate server setup. It's lightweight, installation-free, and can easily handle the data requirements of a medium-sized application. This option allows the developer to transition to a more robust database system without the complexity of full MySQL migration, while also providing an easier path for future scalability if needed."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/06", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/484825", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/133430/"], "docs_id": 484825, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The datasheet for the LMH6702 recommends using 6\\.8uF bypass capacitors on both power supply pins.

For the low impedance load, the LMH6702 can slew its output very quickly, requiring bulk bypass capacitors (6.8\u03bcF) to handle the high current demands. This is in addition to smaller high-frequency decoupling capacitors. However, when driving the high impedance input of the ADC08200, the output current from the LMH6702 is much lower, so the bulk bypass capacitors are not necessary. In this case, the 0.1\u03bcF capacitors suggested in the ADC08200 datasheet are sufficient for proper operation.

I'll get to it later. Once you have the script, all you have to do is to execute it. As suggested before, edit your \\~/.bashrc file and add at the end a line containing the path to your script. For example, if you have the script in your home folder and the script's filename is \"cowscript\", then you could add the following line at the end of your \\~/.bashrc file:\n\n```\n$HOME/cowscript\n\n```\n\nNow, the script used in Linux Mint 9 is the following:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nRANGE=4\n\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        cow=\"small\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        cow=\"tux\"\n        ;;\n    2)\n        cow=\"koala\"\n        ;;\n    3)\n        cow=\"moose\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nRANGE=2\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowsay\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowthink\"\n        ;;\nesac\n/usr/games/fortune | $command -f $cow\n\n```\n\nBasically, it will display a random cow (either *small*, *tux*, *koala*, or *moose*) and the message will be taken from fortune. Also, this script will execute wither *cowsay* or *cowthink*, the only difference being that *cowthink* will display a thinking cow instead of a talking cow.\n\nNow, the fun thing is that you can modify the script to show more cows or to show different cows. To do that, you first need to know what cows you have installed. In a terminal, run:\n\n```\ncowsay -l\n\n```\n\nYou can use any of those cows. All you have to do is to edit the script: if you want to add a new cow, just copy the lines containing \"cow\" (plus the number and semi\\-colons) and paste them before the line that says \"esac\". Then, change the number and name of the cow, so for instance, if you want to add a cow called \"udder\", all you have to do is to add these lines before the first \"esac\":\n\n```\n4)\n    cow=\"udder\"\n    ;;\n\n```\n\n**Important**: the second line of the file, \"RANGE\\=4\", must be changed also. If you add one cow, then instead of 4 use 5, also if you delete one cow, then you must use 3, and so on. Also note that the numbers that you see must be in the range from 0 to *RANGE \\- 1*. That's why RANGE is 4 and the numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3\\.\n\nYou could also create your own cows, although that might take a bit more of work. All you have to do is to get any ASCII art you like and edit it, but it is a bit tricky. You can see how it's done here: [http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow\\-to\\-make\\-a\\-cow\\-talk\\-on\\-terminal\\-startup/](http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow-to-make-a-cow-talk-on-terminal-startup/) However, consider that any **@** and **\\\\** symbols need to be backslashed, that is, you must put before that symbol this other symbol: **\\\\**. This might be the case for **\\#**, too (but not always). If your ASCII Art contains **\\#**, you could backslash it too, but sometimes it would be enough with just one of them... I'm not sure how to explain it, sorry. I guess you will have to try to see if it works. Also, make sure that the file you edit has the extension \".cow\"\n\nFinally, once you have your own cows, you can either add them to the default location (you probably will need to be superuser for that) at /usr/share/cowsay/cows, or you could add to your \\~/.bashrc file this lines:\n\n```\nexport COWPATH=\"/usr/share/cowsay/cows\"\n# set COWPATH so it includes user's cows\nif [ -d \"$HOME/cowfiles\" ] ; then\n    COWPATH=\"$COWPATH:$HOME/cowfiles\"\nfi\n\n```\n\nBe sure to add those lines before you call your \"cowscript\". This also assumes that you have a folder called \"cowfiles\" on your home folder. Change the path if you want so it points to the folder where you have your cowfiles."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to customize your terminal to display a random cowsay message when it starts up.

How do I interpret it? I assume that if lower bound of interval is higher than 0\\.5 then I can conclude that my model is better than random one. What confuses me is that $AUC$ is in the middle of interval so it will always be inside CI. I think that maybe if my model was applied to some different observation, I would be 95% sure that its $AUC$ fit into CI. Am I right?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confidence interval is an interval\\-estimate for some true value of a parameter. Let us (as an example) start with e.g. a confidence interval for the mean of a normal distribution and then move on to ROC and AUC so that one sees the analogy. \n\nAssume that you have a random normal variable $X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu;\\\\sigma)$. Where $\\\\mu$ is the **unknown** population mean and, to keep it simple, let us assume that $\\\\sigma$ is known. \n\nWe now draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of X, i.e. we get a sample $x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\dots x\\_n$. The goal is to have an idea about the unknown $\\\\mu$ using the sample drawn. It is well known that the arithemetic average $\\\\bar{x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_i x\\_i$ is an unbiased (point) estimator for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$ and that $\\[\\\\bar{x}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{x}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$ is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$. \n\nIf we draw another sample $y\\_1, \\\\dots , y\\_n$ from the distribtion of $X$ then, in the same way we will find **another** confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ as $\\[\\\\bar{y}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{y}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$. \n\nSo each time we draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, we find a confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ and all these intervals will be different. **The fact that it is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval means that, if we draw an 'infinite' number of samples of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, and for each of these samples we compute the $95\\\\%$ confidence interval, then $95\\\\%$ of all these intervals (one interval for each sample) will contain the unknown $\\\\mu$.** (so sometimes , namely $5\\\\%$ of the intervals, such an interval will not contain the unknown $\\\\mu$, so sometimes you have bad luck.)\n\nThe same holds for the AUC, when you compute the AUC, you compute it from a sample, in other words what you compute is an estimate for the **true *unknown* AUC**. Similarly you can, for the sample that you have, compute a confidence interval for the true but unknown AUC. If you were able to draw an infinite number of samples, and for each sample obtained compute the confidence interval for the true AUC, then $95\\\\%$ of these computed intervals would contain the true but unknown AUC. \n\n**Note that the interval is random, because it is computed from a random sample. The true AUC is not random, it is some unknown property of your population.**\n\nUnfortunately you can not draw an infinite number of samples, most of the time you have only one sample, so you will have to do it with one interval, **but you are rather confident** ($95\\\\%$ of the so computed intervals will contain the true unknown AUC) that this interval will contain the true AUC. And yes, if the lower border of the interval is higer than 0\\.5 then **you can be rather confident that** your model is not the random model, but, as above, you may also have had bad luck with the sample."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An analyst has developed a predictive model and calculated its Area Under the Curve (AUC) to be 0.75 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.70, 0.80].

Recently I've been trying to follow a more domain centric design philosophy and I'm looking for advice in the best way to solve a specific problem.\n\nI am implementing a basic 2d grid. There are 3 basic classes, Item, Tile (has a list of Items), and World (has a 2d array of Tiles).\n\nI am struggling with where to put the move() method which moves an item from one tile to a neighboring tile. My initial inclination would be to place the move method in the Item class since it is the item that is actually moving.\n\nHowever, that would create a circular dependency. In the past I always worked with dumb objects in which case the move() method was in a higher layer (some kind of WorldManager or MoveManager) which knows about both tiles and items. I'm interested in what proposals others might have that can avoid the circular dependency while maintaining the domain\\-centric philosophy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To answer your question directly:\n\nA player would tell (by picking it up) an item to move from one tile to another. So logically, the move method goes on Item and receives the two Tiles as parameters.\n\nNow having said that:\n\nDon't let DDD get in the way of single\\-responsibility principle. It's ok to have non\\-entity items, such as MoveManager, and call it part of your domain. Just because you don't persist it anywhere, doesn't make it less a part of the domain.\n\nPeople often confuse the data model with the behaviour (or business domain) model when talking about DDD. Anything can be an entity. In fact, one could argue that anything persisted [already has its single responsibility](http://blog.pluralsight.com/2012/03/02/whats-the-single-responsibility-of-an-entity-in-domain-driven-design/) and shouldn't be given any more.\n\n[From MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419654.aspx):\n\n> I, for one, am not disturbed by the need to involve other, non\\-entity classes, and I would try to avoid lifting the central behavior outside of my entity. You should always remember that entities are intrinsically behavioral units. Often that behavior will be implemented as a kind of state machine\u2014when you invoke a command on an entity, it is responsible for changing its internal state\u2014but sometimes it's necessary for you to obtain additional data or impose side\\-effects upon the outside world."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a domain-centric design for a 2D grid system with Item, Tile, and World classes, what is the most appropriate approach for implementing the move() method while adhering to domain-driven design principles and avoiding circular dependencies?\n\nA) Implement the move() method in the Item class, passing Tile objects as parameters\nB) Create a separate MoveManager class to handle all movement operations\nC) Place the move() method in the World class, as it has knowledge of all Tiles and Items\nD) Implement the move() method in the Tile class, as it contains the list of Items\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nWhile option A might seem logical from a domain perspective, it could lead to circular dependencies. Option C centralizes too much responsibility in the World class. Option D doesn't align well with the domain model, as Tiles shouldn't be responsible for moving Items.\n\nThe correct answer, B, suggests creating a separate MoveManager class. This approach aligns with the single-responsibility principle while still being considered part of the domain in DDD.

However, the exterior of the wall has some wood siding that is about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. So I'm not sure if these wood planks are necessary.

The planks likely serve a crucial structural purpose by providing shear strength to the building, especially important in areas prone to high winds, storms, or earthquakes.

The best approach is to carefully remove them to allow for the installation of new wiring and insulation, then reinstall them to maintain the home's structural integrity.

There are other disk repair utilities out there like DiskWarrior, Drive Genius and the like.\n\nIf you don't have one, you should. you won't use it often but will be glad you have it when stuff like this happens.\n\nFailing that and assuming that you already have a backup you can boot to the recovery partition and use disk utility to remove the current partition and reformat a new one.

These tools often have more advanced repair capabilities than the built-in Disk Utility. If these fail, the next steps would be to attempt reformatting and reinstalling the OS. Only if all software-based solutions fail should hardware replacement be considered. Option A is premature without trying software solutions first. Option C ignores the underlying partition issues, which could lead to further problems. Option D is risky and doesn't address the potential hardware issues.

Additionally, enabling CD Text is not recommended for very old players.\n\nThe key points are using CD-R (not DVD-R), burning as Red Book CDDA format, using WAV or AIFF files, and avoiding advanced features like CD Text for maximum compatibility with vintage players."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/23", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/177877", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/86496/"], "docs_id": 177877, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Everything I saw suggests coulomb has no fundamental units.\nSo then how is Newton/Coulomb equivalent to Volt/meter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The coulomb (C) is the *derived* unit for charge in SI. One coulomb is the amount of charge in one ampere\\-second. The elementary charge (charge of one proton or (\\-) electron) is roughly ${\\\\sim}1\\.602\\\\times10^{\\-19}\\\\:\\\\mathrm C.$ Moreover, $1\\\\:\\\\mathrm C \\=1\\\\:\\\\mathrm{A\\\\,s}$.\n\nThe units work out the in the equivalency, which never requires breaking the coulomb into its base units, as follows:\n\n* Newton: amount of force used when accelerating one kilogram at 1 meter per second squared, $$1\\\\:\\\\mathrm N \\= 1\\\\mathrm{\\\\frac{kg \\\\, m}{s^2}}.$$\n* Joule: energy transferred (or work done) when applying a force of one newton through a distance of one meter, $$1\\\\:\\\\mathrm J \\=1\\\\:\\\\mathrm{N \\\\, m}.$$\n* Volt: potential energy of one joule per electric charge of one coulomb, $$1\\\\:\\\\mathrm V \\= 1\\\\:\\\\mathrm{\\\\frac{J}{C}}.$$\n* Converting volts to joules per coulomb, then joules to newton\\-meters, then cancelling the meter, you get\n$$\\\\mathrm{\n1\\\\:\\\\frac{N}{C} \\= 1\\\\:\\\\frac{V}{m} \\= 1\\\\:\\\\frac{J}{C \\\\, m} \\= 1\\\\:\\\\frac{N \\\\, m}{C \\\\, m} \\= 1\\\\:\\\\frac{N}{C}.\n}$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A parallel plate capacitor has a uniform electric field between its plates. If the distance between the plates is doubled while maintaining the same charge, how will the electric field strength and potential difference between the plates change?\n\nA) The electric field strength will halve, and the potential difference will remain constant.\nB) The electric field strength will halve, and the potential difference will double.\nC) The electric field strength will remain constant, and the potential difference will double.\nD) Both the electric field strength and potential difference will halve.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThis question tests understanding of the relationships between electric field strength, potential difference, and distance in a capacitor, as well as the units involved.\n\n1. Electric field strength (E) is measured in N/C or V/m. It's given by E = V/d, where V is the potential difference and d is the distance between plates.\n\n2. When the distance is doubled, the electric field strength will halve because E is inversely proportional to d.\n\n3. Potential difference (V) is measured in volts, which is equivalent to joules per coulomb (J/C). It's given by V = Ed.\n\n4. When d is doubled and E is halved, their product (V) will double.\n\n5. This aligns with the equivalence shown in the documentation: 1 N/C = 1 V/m.\n\nOption B correctly captures both of these changes. A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the change in potential difference. C is wrong because the electric field strength does change. D is incorrect on both counts."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/01/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/35620", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/2471/"], "docs_id": 35620, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As noted by the title, is nesting types (e.g. enumerated types or structures in a class) considered bad practice or not?

The warning you are receiving is not suggesting you never have a nested type. It is simply indicating that your nested type should use an appropriate access modifier and code location.\n\nIf the nested type is truly only used inside the containing class (i.e. it is an internal data container or status indicator), then set its access modifier to private.\n\nIf the nested type is part of one or more method signatures, then it is not in fact local to the containing class. It represents a message being passed to or from instances of the containing class. In this case, it is arguably better to move the nested type out of the containing class, and give it a more open access modifier such as internal or public.\n\nIn short, the warning appears to be recommending that you make local types private, and shared types should stand alone."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is working on a C# project and receives the following warning from Visual Studio Code Analysis:\n\nWarning 34 CA1034 : Microsoft.Design :\n Do not nest type\n 'ClassName.StructureName'.\n Alternatively, change its\n accessibility so that it is not\n externally visible.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate action for the developer to take in response to this warning?\n\nA) Remove all nested types from the project, as they are considered bad practice.\nB) Ignore the warning, as nested types are always acceptable in C# programming.\nC) Make the nested type private if it's only used within the containing class, or move it outside the class if it's used in method signatures.\nD) Always move nested types outside of their containing classes, regardless of their usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to evaluate the usage of the nested type and act accordingly. If the nested type is truly only used inside the containing class (e.g., as an internal data container or status indicator), it should be made private. This addresses the warning by changing its accessibility so that it's not externally visible. On the other hand, if the nested type is part of one or more method signatures, it represents a shared type that should be moved outside the containing class and given a more open access modifier such as internal or public. This approach ensures that local types remain private while shared types are appropriately accessible, following best practices in C# programming."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/07/27", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10114", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130556/"], "docs_id": 10114, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to search for Windows 7 on SU; get a notion of what the FAQ were and so forth.\n\nHowever, searching for Windows 7 yields simply Windows in the search engine. \n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This does correctly map to [windows\\-7](/questions/tagged/windows-7 \"show questions tagged 'windows-7'\") now, as we do a guess on the top (n) tags based on a few heuristics \\-\\- even combining words when you enter two, etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the search functionality for tags on Stack Exchange, as explained in the documentation?\n\nA) The search engine always matches exact phrases entered by users, without any interpretation.\n\nB) The search engine uses complex algorithms to guess the most relevant tags, even combining words when multiple are entered.\n\nC) Users must manually select tags from a predefined list to ensure accurate search results.\n\nD) The search functionality is limited to single-word tags and cannot process multi-word queries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that the search engine \"does a guess on the top (n) tags based on a few heuristics -- even combining words when you enter two, etc.\" This indicates that the system uses sophisticated algorithms to interpret user queries and match them to the most relevant tags, even when the input doesn't exactly match the tag name.
