For full programming capabilities and crucially, debugging features like breakpoints, it's recommended to use a cheap SWD (Serial Wire Debug) adapter. This can be a dedicated ST-Link module, or even a repurposed Discovery board with the appropriate jumper configuration. Using an SWD adapter with software like ST's tools on Windows, or open-source options like Texane's tool or OpenOCD on Linux/Mac, provides both code loading and full debugging functionality.

Seems like one might assume they are equal, but this is not true. I also noted that it seems when the range of A \\& B respectively are small the median(A/B) is quite near median(A)/median(B), but with a large range the two values seem to diverge. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a property of mathematics, it is actually rare that the order of operations does not matter, e.g. the log of the square root is not the same as the square root of the log (except for a few special cases).\n\nWe often focus on some of those special cases where due to operations distributing, associating, and commuting (flashbacks to algebra, oh no!) we can do things in either order. For example to compute a mean we can either add the numbers together then divide the sum by $n$, or we can divide each number by $n$ then sum those values. This is because division (multiplication) distributes over addition. With paired data we have the fact that the mean of the differences is the difference of the means. But these are the rarer cases, not the rule.\n\nSo in general you should not expect to get the same result when you do things in a different order, it is also not true that the mean of the ratios is the ratio of the means, so why should it be true for the median?"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing two datasets, A and B, each containing 100 numeric values.

These are different operations and the order matters.\n\nB is incorrect because the mean of ratios is not equal to the ratio of means in general. This is a common misconception.\n\nC is correct. As mentioned in the original text, when the ranges of A and B are small, median(A)/median(B) tends to be closer to median(A/B). This is because with smaller ranges, there's less variability in the ratios, making the two calculations more similar.\n\nD is incorrect. The order of operations does matter when working with means and medians of ratios.

I really think that if one placed the input of air or water somewhere in the midle of the turbine intead of the edge one will be able to place the vent holes in the inner half of the turbine.

To do so, add the following at the very top of your nginx.conf:\n\n```\nload_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\n\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```\nnginx -t\n\n```\n\nIf all is well:\n\n```\nnginx -s reload\nservice nginx restart\n\n```\n\nEdit:\n\n```\n-s signal' Send signal to the master process. The argument signal can be one of: stop, quit, reopen, reload. The following table shows the corresponding system signals.\n\nstop' SIGTERM\nquit' SIGQUIT\nreopen' SIGUSR1\nreload' SIGHUP\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are using Nginx version 1.12.0 and want to implement UDP load balancing using the stream module. After adding the stream directive to your nginx.conf file, you encounter an \"unknown directive 'stream'\" error. What is the most likely cause and solution for this issue?\n\nA) The stream module is not installed. You need to recompile Nginx with the --with-stream option.\n\nB) The stream module is installed but not loaded. Add the line \"load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\" at the top of your nginx.conf file.\n\nC) The stream module is incompatible with your version of Nginx. Upgrade to a newer version that supports the stream module.\n\nD) The stream directive is placed in the wrong location in the nginx.conf file. Move it inside the http block.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The error message suggests that Nginx doesn't recognize the stream directive, even though the stream module is included in Nginx 1.12.0. The configuration output shows that the stream module was compiled as a dynamic module (--with-stream=dynamic). To use a dynamic module, it needs to be explicitly loaded in the configuration file. Adding the line \"load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;\" at the top of the nginx.conf file will load the stream module, allowing you to use the stream directive for UDP load balancing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the module is already installed, just not loaded. Option C is unnecessary since version 1.12.0 supports the stream module. Option D is incorrect because the stream directive should be at the same level as the http block, not inside it."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/08", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/85733", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/31923/"], "docs_id": 85733, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My items are not showing an out of stock message/label on the catogroy pages, if you click a sold out item it does state as out of stock on the product page..\n\nI installed an app to move all of the out of stock items last.\nI also edited my theme a little and I am wondering if I have excellently clicked the wrong settings or removed some code. I can't find any information about this online, as I am sure its not something that normally goes wrong, or I am just being stupid.\n\nThis is very annoying because people do not know what is out of stock until they click items and then they may just think everything is out of stock and give up looking.\n\n---\n\n\\=\\=\\=\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Magento\n *\n * @category    design\n * @package     meigeetheme_default\n * @copyright   Copyright (c) 2012 MeigeeTeam.

$order->getCurrencyCode();\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct answer because it accurately retrieves the last real order ID from the checkout session, loads the order using the increment ID, and then correctly accesses the grand total and order currency code. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't specify which order to load and uses incorrect method names for retrieving the total and currency.\n\nOption B is close but uses getLastOrderId() instead of getLastRealOrderId(), which may not always return the correct order ID in all scenarios.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses non-existent methods (getLastOrder(), getTotalDue(), getCurrencyCode()) that are not part of the standard Magento sales/order model."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date":

We've more or less finished transitioning our Java codebase into one managed and built with Maven. Now, I'd like for us to integrate with Hudson and Sonar or something similar. My reasons for this are that it'll provide a 'zero\\-click' build step to provide testers with new experimental builds, that it will let us deploy applications to a server more easily, that tools such as Sonar will provide us with well\\-needed metrics on code coverage, Javadoc, package dependencies and the like.\n\nHe thinks that the overhead of getting up to speed with two new frameworks is unacceptable, and that we should simply double down on documentation and create our own scripts for deployment. Since we plan on some aggressive rewrites to pay down the technical debt previous developers incurred (gratuitous use of Java's Serializable interface as a file storage mechanism that has predictably bit us in the ass) he argues that we can document as we go, and that we'll end up changing a large swath of code in the process anyways.\n\nI contend that having accurate metrics that Sonar (or fill in your favorite similar tool) provide gives us a good place to start for any refactoring efforts, not to mention general maintenance \\-\\- after all, knowing which classes are the most poorly documented, even if it's just a starting point, is better than seat\\-of\\-the\\-pants guessing.\n\nAm I wrong, and trying to introduce more overhead than we really need? Some more background: an alumni of our company is working at a Navy research lab now and suggested these two tools in particular as one they've had great success with using. My coworker and I have also had our share of friendly disagreements before \\-\\- he's more of the \"CLI for all, compiles Gentoo in his spare time and uses Git\" and I'm more of a \"Give me an intuitive GUI, plays with XNA and is fine with SVN\" type, so there's definitely *some* element of culture clash here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider what buys you the most and when.\n\nMy guess is that you want to use Hudson for a build server, and Sonar for providing \"quality metrics\".\n\nThe build server is crucial and essential! You should only send binaries out of the house built and tested by the build server directly from the sources in your source control system. For your internal housekeeping the build number should be embedded in the binaries sent out of the house. The value of this simply cannot be overestimated! \n\nThe \"quality metrics\" are nice, but do you *need* them right now? I would expect that it is less important than the build engine and therefore I would postpone them until your coworker is ready for more.\n\nYou will find it VERY easy to do Maven builds with Hudson. So do that, and save Sonar for later.\n\nNote that there are RPM's available for Redhat based Linux systems providing for automatic upgrades with yum which is nice.\n\nAnd just for the record: Use products for these kinds of things.

The answer states, \"The build server is crucial and essential!\" and recommends doing Maven builds with Hudson first, saving Sonar for later.

Also, by \"identical spheres\", I'm assuming (drawing from experience with other questions in the book, again) they mean \"Identical, uniform spheres\".\n\nInstinctively, I quickly jotted down\n\n$${F}\\\\propto{1/R^2}$$\n\nQuite easy to come up with, really... two identical, uniform spheres in contact will have their centers of mass separated by a distance of $R$ \\+ $R$ \\= $2R$, and the rest is Newton's law of universal gravitation,\n\n$$F \\= \\\\frac {G.M.m}{d^2}$$\n\n---\n\nBut here's the catch:\n\nThe supplied answer follows a different rationale, to arrive at a totally different relation.\n\n> $$F \\= \\\\frac {G.M.m}{d^2}$$\n> \n> \n> \\=\\> $$F \\= \\\\frac {G.M.M}{(2R)^2}$$\n> \n> \n> Since mass can be expressed as the product of density ($\u03c1$) and volume ($V$),\n> \n> \n> \\=\\> $$F \\= \\\\frac {G.(\u03c1)\\[(4/3\\)\u03c0R^3].(\u03c1)\\[(4/3\\)\u03c0R^3]}{(2R)^2}$$\n> \n> \n> \\=\\> $${F}\\\\propto\\\\frac{R^6}{R^2}$$\n> \n> \n> \\=\\> $${F}\\\\propto{R^4}$$\n\n---\n\nI was incredulous at first.\n\n\"Gravitational force is *directly* proportional to the *fourth* power of distance?!

And if the mass increases, so would the gravitational force between the spheres.\n\nWhy *my* answer (inverse square law) would be \"wrong\" here, is because when I take up the center of mass argument, it doesn't consider the \"contact\" constraint.\n\n---\n\n**So is the answer supplied in the book correct? If so, is it for the same reasons as I've mentioned? Or am I missing something?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The fundamental problem is that the question doesn't give enough information.\n\nOne approach is to assume the spheres have the same mass whatever their radius. Thus the force is as you calculated, goes as $1/R^2$\n\nThe other approach is to assume the spheres have constant density whatever the radius. In this case the masses change as the radius changes, and as such the force goes as $R^4$.\n\nSo, in a way, both answers are right."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Two identical spheres of radius R are in contact with each other.

The relationship depends on unstated assumptions:\n\n1. If we assume the spheres have constant mass regardless of radius, then F \u221d 1/R\u00b2 (option A) would be correct, following Newton's law of gravitation with a separation distance of 2R between the centers.\n\n2. If we assume the spheres have constant density, then as R increases, the mass increases as R\u00b3. This leads to F \u221d R\u2074 (option B), because the masses in Newton's law would each contribute R\u00b3, while the denominator contributes R\u00b2.\n\n3.

I strongly recommend not ever using a vapor barrier in a basement. Read through my answer above for some more details. But, in summary: XPS acts a moisture retarder, but will still allow trapped moisture to dry to one side or the other. And since a basement can have moisture on either side, it's good to let it breath. When I finished my basement in MN, this was the biggest challenge I had with the St. Paul building inspectors. They insisted on vapor barriers, though invariably, in every basement I visited in MN with a VB, it smelled musty. I eventually did enough research to show them that the times have changed and VBs are not recommended that much anymore in basements by modern builders.\n2. adding the fiberglass likely wouldn't hurt anything...it's more insulation. But it may not add a whole lot, either, if the XPS is already sufficiently thick enough. So, the question is how thick is the current XPS?

This method allows for proper moisture management, as XPS acts as a moisture retarder while still allowing any trapped moisture to dry to either side.

Maybe I missed it, but I don't see a specification for the maximum reverse current through an output (the 0\\.3V negative voltage will be exceeded).

Essentially you then create an electron beam. This is the basic principle of a [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube), [a cathode ray tube (tv tube)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) and an [electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope).\n\nIt is even possible to create an arc in \"vacuum\". This happens when the cathode or anode material evaporates (every material, including metals, has a non\\-zero vapor pressure) and the gas (evaporated metal) then becomes ionized and becomes conductibe. Then of course we do not have a true vacuum anymore. The message is that as long as we have electrodes in a fixed compartment we cannot have ideal vaccuum. This in turn then can even lead to arcing. This for instance happens in [vaccuum power switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_interrupter)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An experimental setup involves a vacuum chamber with two electrodes. As the voltage between the electrodes is gradually increased, which of the following phenomena is most likely to occur first?\n\nA) Formation of a stable plasma\nB) Emission of electrons from the cathode\nC) Spontaneous generation of particles\nD) Breakdown of the vacuum chamber walls\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: As the voltage is increased, electrons will be able to leave the cathode once the potential energy from the applied voltage exceeds the work function of the cathode material. This electron emission occurs before other phenomena like plasma formation or chamber breakdown. Option A is incorrect because a stable plasma requires ionization of gas, which isn't initially present in a vacuum. Option C is physically impossible, and option D would require extremely high voltages beyond those needed for electron emission."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/09/03", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/535837", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/101753/"], "docs_id": 535837, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a Postfix server setup which works fine most of the time but between 100 \\- 200 mails gets deferred every day with the following errors:\n\n```\nstatus=deferred (lost connection with alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[74.125.142.27] while sending RCPT TO)\n\nstatus=deferred (lost connection with mta6.am0.yahoodns.net[66.196.118.34] while sending message body)\n\n```\n\nThat's around 10 % of all outgoing mails.

The fact that you get the 554 after the end of DATA suggests that there is something in the content of the message that they don't like, although the server *could* have already decided that it's going to reject your message much earlier than that and has been configured to wait until the end for various reasons (1\\. waste your time/bandwidth/resources, and 2\\. gather as much information about your message as possible).\n\nThe hardest part of these situations is that you're failing policies that are developed and enforced by the receiving end; they might be rejecting your message because the body has the word \"apple\" in it and the last octet of your IP address is a multiple of 3 for all we know. Highly unlikely, but possible.\n\nMessages usually aren't rejected based on failure of 1 criteria, especially by \"the big boys\", so I would *guess* that you're failing multiple tests, but the only way to find out exactly (considering the lack of information in the rejection message) is to ask them unfortunately.\n\nI found [this page](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/69585?hl=en) for Google in relation to your problem which may be a good path to follow.

The fact that the error occurs after the DATA command suggests that the content of the message is triggering the rejection. Additionally, the documentation mentions that newly composed emails to the same recipients are accepted, indicating that the issue is likely with the specific content of the bounced emails rather than server configuration or IP reputation.

What is the most effective sequence of steps to reveal the entire diagram in Word?\n\nA) Adjust your monitor resolution, copy the Visio diagram again, and paste it into Word using \"Paste Special\" as a device-independent bitmap.\n\nB) In Word, right-click the pasted image, select \"Size and Position\", and manually enter the original dimensions of the Visio diagram.\n\nC) Copy the Visio elements, paste into Word, resize the image smaller, right-click and select the Crop button, then expand from a corner in crop mode to reveal the full diagram.\n\nD) Export the Visio diagram as a high-resolution image file, then insert this image file into Word using the \"Insert\" tab and \"Pictures\" option.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it follows the exact steps outlined in the StackExchange documentation to solve this specific issue. This method addresses the problem where the full Visio diagram is actually present but not visible, and uses Word's crop tool to reveal the hidden portions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adjusting monitor resolution doesn't address the core issue and using \"Paste Special\" doesn't necessarily solve the problem.\n\nOption B is incorrect because manually entering dimensions doesn't guarantee that the full diagram will be visible, and it doesn't utilize the crop tool which is key to revealing the hidden portions.\n\nOption D, while potentially a workable solution in some cases, is not the most effective method as described in the documentation.

This involves 2 cuts, the first is to remove enough so that when the second cut is made the remaining section can be handled safely. Use a reciprocating saw with a long enough metal cutting blade.  After the second cut the pipe should be 3/4\\-1 inch protruding from the ground. Next make 2 cuts so that the pipe is cut in quarters. With a cold chisel and short handled sledge pound each of the 4 quartered pipe sections inwards to the pipe.  Hammer each section at a time until they touch the inside of the pipe. When done the pipe will be below ground level and ready to be filled with asphalt.  Alternately, once the pipe has been cut so that it is close to the ground cut the inside wall with a new saw\\-zall metal blade and again at 30 degrees from the first. You may not cut all the way through, but the resulting 2 slices will be enough to snap the pipe with pliers.

From my understanding, ARIMA forecasts better for short\\-term projections rather than long\\-term projections (is this true or false)? I am implementing the ARIMA to make a 6 month projection on a daily basis. Would I get better results if I predict one day, then retrain the model including that day, then predicting the next day, and then retraining, and so on?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses. Sorry if I wasn't being clear. I am using the ARIMAX model, and I have about 30 exogenous variables. I know what the actual values are for the endogenous variable, even for the 6 month projection period. I want to test how well my model performs on this 6 month period. So what I meant by retraining is that after I make a prediction for the next day using n samples, I would retrain on n\\+1 samples, where the new sample is using the actual value for the endogenous variable as opposed to the prediction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ARIMA models are univariate so the only information they use is the history of the series. Essentially, they tell you how the variable will react to previous stochastic variation. When you start forecasting with them you no longer have any 'noise' in them because your model will not add in error terms (and nor should it). So what you'll see is that the forecast will quickly decay to the constant term/trend in your ARIMA model. Re\\-estimating the model won't help because you're not adding any new information about the underlying process.\n\nOver 180\\+ forecast periods you'll need to add in more explanatory variables to get anything more than a trend line out of your model. For instance, you might include macroeconomic projections as an input, which would give you some dynamics over a 6 month period.\n\n**Update:** If you are going for in\\-sample predictive power then using all the data will give you a better fit, so yes it will improve. The underlying question is what you want to achieve. If you're trying to understand the causative factors explaining the dependent variable then a few extra observations aren't going to overturn your theoretical priors. If you want forecasting power then you want to use as much data as possible to estimate your model. Of course you need to be wary of overfitting, which I guess is why you want to check the estimation against a sub\\-sampled model. If you're seeing a lot of change in your coefficients as you increase the sample size and they don't stabilise that's indicating your model's mis\\-specified."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An analyst is using an ARIMAX model with 30 exogenous variables to make a 6-month projection on a daily basis.

I have experienced both (not in the order presented below :\\-) ).\n\nMost likely cause in general is **battery exhausted and not recharging** due to insufficient power supply voltage. Most micro\\-USB chargers are rated for 1\\.0A current; the Asus T100 requires 2\\.0A.\n\nDue to Li\\-Ion battery design, when it is just \"topping off\", the Asus will require less than 1A of current. Therefore, practically any charger will be able to top off the Asus.\n\nBut when it is markedly discharged, the Asus will attempt to suck the full 2A of current, and this will drop the input voltage a bit. If the power supply is not the original one, and is only rated for 1\\.0A, the voltage drop will be enough to drive the voltage outside the battery controller's \"comfort zone\", and the red LED light will power on (since current is being drawn) \\-\\- but the battery won't recharge, as the controller won't allow it. With some aftermarket chargers you will notice the light on the charger going off, then on, then off, continuously.\n\nPC USB ports also sometimes have an overcurrent protection, so that they won't charge a flat\\-batteried Asus even if they will allow it to top off.\n\nSolution is of course to use the original Asus power supply, or a power supply with a higher **current** rating, typically 2\\.1A (be careful; higher **current** ratings will not damage the Asus, but higher **voltage** ratings, rare as they are, definitely will). You want to have exactly 5\\.0V (the USB standard) and equal or more than 2\\.0A. Standard smartphone chargers are 1\\.0A or less, and will definitely not work, *even if they might work when the Asus isn't completely flat*. Some tablet chargers are 2\\.1A and will work.\n\nThe other possibility is a faulty battery connection. The battery has an internal connector covered by a transparent yellow adhesive protection film, but there are reports that the connector might sometimes not be plugged all the way in. Unless you're very very careful, this will void the warranty: insert a guitar pick or a thin hard **plastic** sliver between the bottom of the tablet and the screen. Drive it gently all around, and you will see the catches snap open. The cover must be slid out towards the USB power plug; do not force it open there, or you might damage the USB connector. Once removed the shell, you will see the battery (a double silvered flat package) and four connectors. The battery one is covered by an adhesive film. Try picking loose the adhesive film; the connector shouldn't move. You can use a hard plastic sliver to pry it loose and re\\-seat it until it clicks, then replace the adhesive film. When putting back the cover, first slide it over the USB connectors; don't simply press it in place. *After* the connectors are slotted in the back cover, then you can press the cover in place (you can just snap each catch closed by pinching screen and cover together with thumb and forefinger in corrispondence of each catch)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with their Asus T100 tablet not charging properly. What is the most likely cause and solution for this problem?\n\nA) The micro-USB port is damaged and needs to be replaced by a technician.\n\nB) The battery is faulty and needs to be replaced entirely.\n\nC) The charger being used doesn't provide sufficient current, and a higher-rated charger is needed.\n\nD) The tablet's software is preventing proper charging and needs to be updated.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the charging issue is that the charger being used doesn't provide sufficient current. The documentation states that the Asus T100 requires a 2.0A current, while most micro-USB chargers are only rated for 1.0A. When the battery is significantly discharged, it attempts to draw the full 2A, which a lower-rated charger cannot provide. This causes the voltage to drop outside the battery controller's acceptable range, preventing charging.\n\nThe solution is to use the original Asus power supply or a charger with a higher current rating (typically 2.1A or higher) that can provide 5.0V and at least 2.0A. Standard smartphone chargers (usually 1.0A or less) are insufficient, especially when the battery is very low.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because there's no indication of hardware failure in the given information.

This method avoids issues with infinite values at r=0 or r\u2192\u221e, and doesn't involve logarithms of dimensionful quantities. It allows for an arbitrary reference point r0, typically with \u03a6(r0) set to 0.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's impossible to choose a finite constant to make the potential approach 0 as r\u2192\u221e. \n\nOption B introduces a truncation radius, which isn't necessary for defining the potential, and doesn't solve the underlying mathematical issues.\n\nOption D attempts to fix the problems with dimensionful quantities in logarithms and keeping the potential negative, but it's an ad hoc solution that doesn't address the fundamental issues in defining the potential for an SIS."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/13", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/914898", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/688826/"], "docs_id": 914898, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want all Nautilus windows/folders to show file listings the same customized way.\n\nOn Windows I'd simply configure a single folder like I want, open options, click \"set all folders like this one\" (or something on those lines, don't remember the exact button label)\n\nOn Nautilus (Ubuntu file manager) I can configure a single folder at a time.

Do NPCs only refer to characters a human player cannot choose to control?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key distinction is that a Bot represents an *automated player*; an NPC, by contrast, *isn't playing the game at all*.\n\nIn general, an **NPC** is a *part of the game*; a placed object which is designed by the creator and exists to *interact with* the player. Examples would include vendors, quest givers, or enemies. In some games, (particularly RPG's), the term is also used to refer to characters *under the control of*, but not *generated by* the player. They are often distinguished by having distinct personalities and dialog, whereas a \"Player Character\" is meant as more of an extension of the player themselves. Think of the companion party members in the *Mass Effect* series for an example.\n\nA **Bot**, by contrast, is essentially a *player of the game* controlled by a computer. This can be populated *within* a single instance, as a feature in some games (i.e. AI opponents in a normally multiplayer game), or, in some cases, actually represents a separate instance of the application running on a networked computer and being controlled by some manner of AI script (as is common in many MMO's, much to the dismay of the communities playing the game). The term 'Bot' is also often used to refer to software used to enhance or replace the skills of a human player of the game; for example, an '*Aim\\-Bot*' that handles targeting, or a '*Farming Bot*' in an MMO that performs tedious or menial tasks.

They can be vendors, quest givers, enemies, or even companion characters in RPGs.

Since intermediate directories in the path also affect this, the permissions must be set appropriately leading up to the ultimate destination that you intend to upload to.\n\nIn the latter case, look at your `vsftpd.conf`. `write_enable` must be true to allow writing (and it is false by default).

But were we able to reduce it to zero? Is there any residual friction?\n\nThis question is about only the friction between the wheel and the road. I understand that there will be friction in other places, e.g. between the wheel and axle or between the vehicle and the atmosphere.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As many others point out, there *is* friction present, otherwise the wheel wouldn't grap the surface and pull the car forward. But you are talking about a different kind of friction. There is a possibility of different kinds of friction:\n\n* [**Kinetic friction**](https://www.allthatmatters.academy/courses/forces-3/lessons/kinetic-friction/), if the wheel ever slides and skids over the asphalt. This is friction between objects that slide over one another.\n* [**Static friction**](https://www.allthatmatters.academy/courses/forces-3/lessons/static-friction/), which is what the other answers talk about. This is friction that holds something still. It always works in the direction that prevents two objects from sliding. The point on the wheel that touches the ground experiences static friction, because it is *standing still* in that very negligibly small moment.\n\nBut\n\n* **rolling friction** is what you are refering to. Ideally there is no kinetic friction, and static friction only grabs the asphalt and doesn't reduce the speed (on horizontal surface and without wheel torque). All other forces that *do* work against the wheel rotation (except friction around the axle, as you also point out) are collectively called *rolling friction*.\n\nRolling friction happens of several different reasons. For example,\n\n* the rubber tires contract and expand and thus dissipate energy. The energy is taken from the rotation, and this factor counts as rolling friction. Also\n* the ground underneath might deform. The deformation costs energy and will as well cause a surface with normal forces that do *not* act radially (towards the wheel's center) anymore. Such forces will cause torques that might counteract the rotation. See the following picture from [this source](http://www.phy.davidson.edu/fachome/dmb/PY430/Friction/rolling.html):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/56VPt.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/56VPt.gif)\n\nWithout rolling friction (in an ideal world), the car will continue to roll and never stop.

Rolling friction still exists.\n\nB is incorrect as it confuses rolling friction with kinetic friction. Kinetic friction occurs during sliding, while rolling friction is a different phenomenon.\n\nC is correct. Static friction at the contact point is indeed necessary for the wheel to grip the road and propel the vehicle forward.
