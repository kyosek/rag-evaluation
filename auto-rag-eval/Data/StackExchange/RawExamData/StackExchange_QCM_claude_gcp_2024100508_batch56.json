Even in my CSS now I hardly ever use classes or id's because I like clean, easy to read, uncluttered html files. For example, why use this:\n\n```html\n<body id=\"anchor\" ontouchstart=\"\">\n  <nav id=\"nav\">\n    <div id=\"design\" class=\"option\">\n      <p class=\"vCenter\">design</p>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"function\" class=\"option\">\n      <p class=\"vCenter\">function</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div id=\"rule\"></div>\n\n    <div id=\"advanced\" class=\"option\">\n      <p class=\"vCenter\">advanced</p>\n    </div>\n  </nav>\n</body>\n\n```\n\nWhen I can use this:\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <nav>\n    <div>\n      <p>design</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p>function</p>\n    </div>  \n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      <p>advanced</p>\n    </div>\n  </nav>\n</body>\n\n```\n\nAnd then use the very powerful CSS3 selectors to access all of my elements. Or I could use JavaScript to give these elements classes and ids. Am I too obsessed with clean code? Or is this a more future proof, cleaner way of developing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **This seems like a very bad idea to me.** defining css rules for classes and adding those classes to the html is a great way to make your css reusable. The way you're suggesting, with a complex selectors, sounds like a recipe for mangled stylesheets. Sure, your html is clean as a whistle, but now the css is a pain in the butt to maintain. \n\nConsider:\n\n```\n.centre-box {\n    /* your rules */\n}\n\n```\n\nVs\n\n```\nbody div > div:nth-of-type(3) > div {\n    /* your rules */\n}\n\n```\n\nThen next week you you add a div above the box you want to be centred, and it's broken. To fix it, you have to find the tangly css rule that targeted your centre\\-box before, and change it to be something new. And all of this hassle so that your html looks cleaner? \n\n**More up front time, higher maintenance cost, no extenuating circumstance that makes it necessary. End of story.**\n\n---\n\nAddendum\n========\n\n### Why do complicated css selectors even exist?\n\nSometimes you want to style more than just one element. Consider this example from [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), a very popular css framework. (Note: It's written in less, which compiles to css. It supports nesting, so all you need to know when reading the example is that `foo { bar { /* rule */ } }` in less is `foo bar { /* rule */ }` in css.)\n\n**Example:** [navbar source](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/navbar.less) uses the `>` selector ([direct child selector](https://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/)) to style direct children of the `.navbar-brand` element. \n\nBut in this case, you use a class with a meaningful name to relate the css rule to a part of the DOM, and you use the fancy selectors to style the child elements of that class. \n\n### What about doing it in JavaScript?\n\nThis seems like a non\\-solution for me too... to convert from using classes and ids and your old stylesheet to doing it with JavaScript, you'll keep your css the same, simplify your html, but *add an entirely new JavaScript file* which must either (1\\) use complex selectors with jQuery, so it's as much of a rat's nest as the crazy selector stylesheet option, or (2\\) use JavaScript without jQuery to traverse the DOM and attache elements as needed. \n\n(1\\) is just as bad as putting it in css, and (2\\) is worse than (1\\) in my opinion because you'll basically have to duplicate your DOM structure in your JavaScript file (just in a different format, but same info), so you still have a DOM with ids and classes, it's just written in JavaScript. That's a **lot** more complexity. \n\n### So what is unobtrusive JavaScript?\n\nI won't give a full treatment of it here because there's lots on Google if you're looking for details. But the key point as it relates to this is that unobtrusive JavaScript is that you don't want your JavaScript to intrude on your html. This relies on using ids and classes to identify which elements to attache JavaScript behaviour to. Unobtrusive JavaScript says: use ids and classes to attach events to elements instead of inlining the JavaScript events. \n\n### In a nutshell\n\nCss classes with meaningful names are the current best way to associate a set of css rules with a portion of the html that you want to modify. This is the current convention, and the alternatives that you're suggesting add complexity and reduce maintainability."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web developer is considering removing all class and id attributes from their HTML to make it \"cleaner\", and instead using complex CSS selectors or JavaScript to style and manipulate elements. Which of the following statements best describes the potential impact of this approach?\n\nA) It will significantly improve performance and make the code more maintainable.\nB) It will make the HTML cleaner but likely create more complex and harder to maintain CSS and JavaScript.\nC) It aligns perfectly with the principles of unobtrusive JavaScript.\nD) It's the recommended best practice for modern web development.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While removing classes and ids from HTML may make it look cleaner, it often leads to more complex and harder to maintain CSS and JavaScript. The top answer in the StackExchange post strongly advises against this approach, stating it's \"a very bad idea\" that results in \"mangled stylesheets\" and higher maintenance costs. Using meaningful class names is considered the current best practice for associating CSS rules with HTML elements, offering better reusability and maintainability. Complex selectors or JavaScript-based styling can lead to fragile code that breaks easily when the HTML structure changes. Additionally, this approach doesn't align with unobtrusive JavaScript principles, which actually rely on using classes and ids to attach behaviors to elements."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/08", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/339428", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/219247/"], "docs_id": 339428, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm having (for example) a entity (Drop) with this NBT: \n\n`{Item:{tag:{display:{Lore:[\"test1\"]}},id:\"minecraft:bread\"}}`\n\nI'm trying to add a new lore:\n\n`/data merge entity @e[type=item,tag=myDrop] {Item:{tag:{display:{Lore:[\"test2\"]}}}}`\n\nBut when I execute this and collect my drop there is ONLY test2 as lore but i need test1 and test2\\.\nPlease help!\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: I don't know the content and/or the count of test1\\.\n\nEDIT2: So simply a array.append() but how in minecraft?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1\\.14 introduces this feature using the \"`append`\" mode of `/data modify`:\n\n```\n/data modify entity @e[type=item,limit=1] Item.tag.display.Lore append value \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"second line\\\"}\"\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Minecraft 1.14+, you want to add a new line of lore to an item without overwriting the existing lore.

You are essentially trying to make a cycle out of only these three steps:\n\n1\\) Isothermal expansion (A to B)\n\n2\\) Adiabatic expansion (B to C)\n\n3\\) Adiabatic compression back to original state (C to A)\n\nThe curve going from C to A cannot be an adiabatic process.

This step is needed so that we can get on the correct adiabatic curve back to state A\n\n---\n\nTo be a little more specific, let's say the pressure and volume at states $B$ and $C$ are $(P\\_B,V\\_B)$ and $(P\\_C,V\\_C)$ respectively.

In a Carnot cycle, an adiabatic process follows the equation PV^n = constant, where n is a property of the gas. When compressing adiabatically from state C, the system would follow the same curve as the previous adiabatic expansion (B to C), but in reverse. This means it would return to state B, not A. \n\nOption A is incorrect because an adiabatic compression does not violate the First Law of Thermodynamics. \n\nOption B is incorrect because an ideal adiabatic process does not change the entropy of the system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while an adiabatic compression does require work input, it wouldn't necessarily require more work than the entire cycle produced. The issue is the path of the compression, not the amount of work involved.\n\nTo complete the Carnot cycle and return to state A, an isothermal compression step is necessary after the adiabatic expansion.

The longer the cable length, the more attenuation of the signal intended signal and greater build\\-up of undesirable signal. The maximum spec'd distance of Ethernet is 100 meters, so at 2% of that, you probably haven't a sufficiently bad enough cable.\n\nUsing a longer cable, introducing an electromagnetic source of interference through inductance, or using a lousier cable (CAT 3 / phone cord) may cause more errors.\n\nErrors are detected using a CRC32 of the ethernet frame.

The longer the cable, the more opportunity there is for signal attenuation and interference buildup.

This UIViewController must be set as the\n>  initial UIViewController for this storyboard.\n\nIt isa mentioned that in case of **Storyboards**, we should create an extension and use that in `UIViewController` : \n\n```\nextension MyViewController: StoryboardInstantiable {\n}  \n\n```\n\n**StoryboardInstantiable :** \n\n```\nimport UIKit\n\nprotocol StoryboardInstantiable: NSObjectProtocol {\n  associatedtype MyType  // 1\n  static var defaultFileName: String { get }  // 2\n  static func instantiateViewController(_ bundle: Bundle?) -> MyType // 3\n}\n\nextension StoryboardInstantiable where Self: UIViewController {\n  static var defaultFileName: String {\n    return NSStringFromClass(Self.self).components(separatedBy: \".\").last!\n  }\n\n  static func instantiateViewController(_ bundle: Bundle? = nil) -> Self {\n    let fileName = defaultFileName\n    let sb = UIStoryboard(name: fileName, bundle: bundle)\n    return sb.instantiateInitialViewController() as! Self\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Queries :** \n\n1. As the author mentioned that separate **Storyboard** would have to be created for each `UIViewController`, how is using Xib a better way in *Coordinator pattern* ?\n2. Why do we need to create a separate **Storyboard** for each `UIViewController` ? Can't we use `UIViewController`'s storyboard identifier for that by not linking any `UIViewController` using segues ? That way can adjust the above extension using identifier and easily achieve the same.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have read that tutorial many times and it uses a Coordinator for each View controller which doesn't make sense to me. I thought that the purpose of a Coordinator was to move the logic of navigation away from the view controllers and into a higher level object that can manage the overall flow. \n\nIf you would like to initialise ViewControllers from the main storyboard, use this protocol and extension instead:\n\n```\nimport UIKit\n\nprotocol Storyboarded {\n    static func instantiate() -> Self\n}\n\nextension Storyboarded where Self: UIViewController {\n    static func instantiate() -> Self {\n        // this pulls out \"MyApp.MyViewController\"\n        let fullName = NSStringFromClass(self)\n\n        // this splits by the dot and uses everything after, giving \"MyViewController\"\n        let className = fullName.components(separatedBy: \".\")[1]\n\n        // load our storyboard\n        let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: Bundle.main)\n\n        // instantiate a view controller with that identifier, and force cast as the type that was requested\n        return storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: className) as! Self\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nThe only requirement is that each View controller used by it has this protocol and has a StoryboardID with the same name as the class. \n\nYou can use it this way:\n\n```\nprivate func startBlueFlow() {\n    let vc = BlueViewControllerOne.instantiate()\n    vc.coordinator = self\n    self.navigationController.push(vc, animated: true)\n}\n\n```\n\n**Disclaimer:** Protocol taken from [this article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps) which may also help you\n\n**UPDATE:** (added reference)\n\n[Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/) is commonly credited and referenced in other articles and tutorials regarding the coordinator pattern in iOS and Redux.

While the initial documentation suggests creating separate Storyboards for each UIViewController, this is not a requirement of the Coordinator pattern itself. The top answer provides a more flexible approach using a single main Storyboard with Storyboard IDs. This method allows for effective implementation of the Coordinator pattern without the need for multiple Storyboards or exclusive use of XIBs. The custom `Storyboarded` protocol and extension demonstrate how to instantiate view controllers from the main Storyboard, maintaining the benefits of the Coordinator pattern while leveraging the visual design capabilities of Storyboards. This approach aligns better with the core purpose of the Coordinator pattern, which is to manage navigation flow and separate it from individual view controllers, rather than dictating specific UI setup methods."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/11", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/12161", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/5019/"], "docs_id": 12161, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a kitchen drain that won't stop leaking.

I am not allowed to add such new fields as 'The country of tax residence' or 'Business form', but I am required to seek existing unused fields with the same data type (but with possibly quite different names) and to use them for my new data.

If your \"Java/PHP/JavaScript\" is where your application logic lives, your application entities should be independent of your storage. If your DBAs are adamant they want huge tables, let them do this, but they should consider [normalizing the database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).\n\nYour queries should not retrieve the entire entity, this is inefficient. For every user table, you might have many user domain objects or DTOs, that handle particular functionality.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider querying database views instead of the tables directly.

This directly corresponds to option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the theorem allows for models of any infinite cardinality, not just countable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the theorem specifically refers to infinite models and infinite cardinalities, not finite ones.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the Axiom of Choice is necessary for proving this theorem.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem and its implications for algebraic structures, as well as the role of the Axiom of Choice in this context."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/22", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/94886", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/23136/"], "docs_id": 94886, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Wikipedia's entry on Gauss:\n\n\"Though Gauss had been up to that point supported by the stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also **did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support**\"\n\nAs a mathematician, I find, rather obviously this opinion to be very shocking (especially coming from Gauss himself).\n\nWikipedia does not give any sources related to the quote above.

According to the expert response, without a source machine to copy permissions from, the situation is very difficult to remedy. The best hope is finding a forgotten tar backup that includes file permissions. However, even with such a backup, restoring the system to perfect functionality is not guaranteed.

I have a set of data points $\\\\{X\\_1, X\\_2, \\\\ldots X\\_n\\\\}$ and a set of possible cluster centers $\\\\{M\\_1, M\\_2, \\\\ldots, M\\_m\\\\}$. Initially, I propose to simply use a weight vector $w$, and compute the scalar product of $w$ and $\\[X\\_i \\- M\\_j]$ to get the distance of point $i$ to cluster centre $j$. This is all very simple... but completely unwieldy if $n$ and/or $m$ and/or the dimensionality of my data points is large. So is there any (simple) way of hiding all the matrix calculations and producing a (matrix/vector) formula that produces the (scalar) distance without using temporary arrays?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Excel supports matrix operations.**\n\nIn this case, do the following:\n\n* Put the data points in an $n$ by $p$ array where $p$ is the dimensionality of the space. Call this array `X`.\n* Put the cluster centers in an $m$ by $p$ array and call it `M`.\n* Put the weights into a $1$ by $p$ array and call it `W`.\n* Create a range for the $n$ by $m$ calculation. Bound it on the left with the sequence $1,2,\\\\ldots, n$, going down the column. To be concrete, let's suppose this sequence is in cells `A2`, `A3`, etc. Bound it above with the sequence $1,2,\\\\ldots, m$. To be concrete, let's suppose this is in cells `B1`, `C1`, etc. Thus the upper left corner of the results will in cell `B2`.\n* Select the top cell in the result array (`B2`). In the formula bar type\n\n```vba\n    =MMULT(W, ABS(TRANSPOSE(OFFSET(X, $A2-1, 0, 1) - OFFSET(M, B$1-1, 0, 1))))\n\n```\n\nand press `Enter`. Drag this formula throughout the entire array, first to the right across all $m$ cells of the top row, and then after selecting the entire top row, down to include all $n$ rows. Judicious use of \"\\\\$\" in the formula causes it to update appropriately when dragged. (This illustrates how to compute an outer product in Excel.)\n\nThis formula does the following:\n\n1. `OFFSET(X, $A2-1, 0, 1)` uses the entries in the left column (column `A`) to index into the rows of array `X`.\n2. `OFFSET(M, B$1-1, 0, 1)` uses the entries in the top row (row `1`) to index into the rows of array `M`.\n3. `-` subtracts the designated row of `M` from the designated row of `X`, yielding a $1$ by $p$ array.\n4. `TRANSPOSE` converts that result to a $p$ by $1$ array.\n5. `MMULT` performs the matrix multiplication of the $1$ by $p$ array `W` by the $p$ by $1$ array computed in the preceding step, producing a $1$ by $1$ array: that is, a number (the distance)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is using Excel to perform nearest neighbor calculations for clustering analysis.

Now both volumes in the properties are at the same level, but the noise coming out was slightly different. \n\nSo do the 2 ports have different \"levels\" of output? Volume, bass, treble...?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on what hardware you have in the computer, but **there usually is a difference between speaker and headphone ports** \\- specifically, relating to the max/min speaker/headphone impedance values you can use with either port.\n\nCertain sound cards, for example the [Auzentech X\\-Fi\\-Forte](http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-fi_forte.php), include a built\\-in headphone amplifier on the headphone port. Taking a look at the actual output port specifications, we can also see different loading levels for the headphone and other line\\-out ports:\n\n```\nHeadphone Load Impedance: 16 - 600 \u03a9\nLine Output    Impedance: 330 \u03a9\nLine/Aux Input Impedance: 10 k\u03a9  (10,000 \u03a9)\n\n```\n\nThis is why many sound cards specify to **not** use a passive (i.e. unamplified) speaker with certain ports, as the lower impedance may cause too much current draw, and possibly damage the particular port. \n\n---\n\nThe general thing to note here, though, is **impedance matching your speakers/headphones to the appropriate port**, and in general, your speakers go to the speaker port, and your (unpowered) headphones go to the headphone port, precisely for the reasons outlined above. This also explains why you might notice a slight difference in the volume levels between the two ports."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A sound engineer is troubleshooting an audio setup where 2.1 speakers are connected to a computer.

The solution is to always use the headphone jack for all audio devices.\n\nB) The speaker port has higher impedance, resulting in lower volume. The solution is to use an external amplifier for the speaker port to match the headphone jack's output.\n\nC) The ports have different impedance ranges, affecting the volume output. The correct solution is to connect the speakers to the speaker port for optimal impedance matching and performance.\n\nD) The volume difference is due to software settings.

Audio ports, particularly headphone and speaker ports, are designed with different impedance ranges to accommodate various types of audio devices. Speakers typically have lower impedance compared to headphones, and the speaker port is designed to handle this. Using the appropriate port ensures optimal impedance matching, which not only affects volume but also overall audio quality and prevents potential damage to the audio hardware.

How does 1 button generates 4 states (from my point of view it should be on/off)?\n\nThe chip under the black epoxy \"bubble\" has an oscillator and a state machine that implements this functionality.\n\n> 2. Could somebody explain me as to a child how the board works?\n\nAll of the functionality is inside the chip, so \"explaining\" how it works would amount to designing something similar to what's on the chip. It's not a very complex chip, and could be easily put together in either a bipolar or a CMOS process, or assembled from discrete transistors (either BJT or MOS).\n\nIt's just as likely though that instead of an ASIC it's just a very simple microcontroller. Then, \"explaining\" would amount to writing a little bit of C or assembly code to provide the same behavior.\n\nTo \"fix\" the board you could remove the original chip (scrape it off), buy a 6\\-pin microcontroller, load it with code that does what you described, solder it down, and you'd end up with the same functionality.\n\n> 3. How to diagnose why it might not work (the root of the question) \u2013 so the LED stopped flashing?\n\nMost likely mechanical stress caused a bonding wire to rip off the chip or off the board. This is a *very low cost* design, and is not particularly sturdy. The cheap PCB substrate bends a lot as the button is operated, and this is not mechanically compatible with relatively rigid epoxy and chip die. Something is apt to get damaged sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you had means to dissolve the epoxy away, I bet you'd find a disconnected/broken bonding wire \\- one or more out of several that connect the chip die to the PCB traces. If you then had access to a wire bonding machine, you could re\\-make the connection, assuming that the chip wasn't damaged.\n\nThere is also some possibility of electrical damage due to static electricity or batteries inserted with reverse polarity.\n\nIn any case, any effort spent on \"fixing\" it is worth orders of magnitude more than the device itself. The cheapest \"fix\" is to get a new one, unless you want to learn a lot about fairly intricate engineering.\n\nTo actually fix it, you'd need to learn the basics of chip de\\-encapsulation (using rather strong chemicals that require lots of care in their use), chip bonding, microscope technique and recognition of chip structures needed to assess the current state of the chip and its connections, etc. Then, if the chip itself was damaged, you could scavenge a chip die from another one of those flashers, attach it to the PCB, and bond it. It takes little time in a well equipped microelectronics prototyping lab, or a lot of time and effort if you'd want to collect 2nd hand tools needed to do it all. You'd also need plenty of practice on working flashers before attempting to fix a broken one. You'd break many in the learning process, too.\n\nUltimately, whether it's \"fixable\" is entirely upon what tools you have access to or can put together, how much you're willing to learn, and how much money you have to pay for all that.\n\nIf your only goal is to \"fix\" the thing: buy a new one. It'll be infinitely cheaper than fixing it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A simple LED flasher circuit powered by two CR2032 3V batteries has stopped working.

While it's theoretically possible to fix by removing the epoxy and rebonding the wires, the expertise and equipment required make this impractical. The most cost-effective and practical solution is to simply replace the entire device with a new one, as attempting repairs would far exceed the cost of the device itself.

Namely the ones labelled `CentOS-Stream`:\n\n```\n$ dnf repolist enabled | grep CentOS\nAppStream                 CentOS-8 - AppStream\nBaseOS                    CentOS-8 - Base\nPowerTools                CentOS-8 - PowerTools\nStream-AppStream          CentOS-Stream - AppStream    #\nStream-BaseOS             CentOS-Stream - Base         #\nStream-extras             CentOS-Stream - Extras       #\ncentosplus                CentOS-8 - Plus\nextras                    CentOS-8 - Extras\nfasttrack                 CentOS-8 - fasttrack\n\n```\n\nBut has anyone actually done this, or can confirm my assumption from their larger \\*nix experience?\n\n\\-\\- edit \\-\\-\n\nI went to actually investigate this today, and found that I don't have the CentOS 8 repos listed above... So I guess Stream isn't an \"add on\" as such. I suppose that makes sense.\n\n```\nappstream          CentOS Stream 8 - AppStream\nbaseos             CentOS Stream 8 - BaseOS\nepel               Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 8 - x86_64\nepel-modular       Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux Modular 8 - x86_64\nextras             CentOS Stream 8 - Extras\nnginx              nginx repo\n\n```\n\nSo, there goes the \"that should be easy enough\" idea. Anyone got any ideas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So it appears that all you need to do is:\n\n1. Get the CentOS\\-\\*.repo files (without Stream in the name) from an other CentOS 8 box. (I had to use a new VM)\n2. Copy \\& Paste / `scp` to the box in question\n3. Disable all the CentOS\\-Stream\\-\\*.repo files in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`\n4. Run `dnf distro-sync` which will downgrade some things (many, many things)\n5. Reboot\n\nThis held the answer: [https://centosfaq.org/centos/moving\\-from\\-centos\\-8\\-to\\-stream\\-and\\-possibly\\-back\\-again/](https://centosfaq.org/centos/moving-from-centos-8-to-stream-and-possibly-back-again/)\n\nThat link's \"switch back command\" also has an instruction to `dnf remove centos-release-stream`, and a removal of the now defunct CentOS\\-Stream\\-\\*.repo files. Which I may do, presuming that I have not killed the box in question.\n\nI will update this answer once the fate of said box is known.\n\n\\-\\- edit: Post above operations \\-\\-\n\nSaid box now doesn't appear to fully boot into Gnome. And root cannot login via SSH. So that's fun. I can still use Webmin, which is good. And while I can reset the root password there, it makes no difference to the denying of root's login.\n\nThe issue was the PAM config files were gone. The Solution for no\\-login was to copy all the content of the *files* in /etc/authselect (not the ones in /etc/authselect/custom) to the box in question. (Clearly, you can only do this if you have access to the machines file system. But as I said, I had Webmin running, so that worked for me)\n\nHooray!\n\nNow, as to the `dnf remove centos-release-stream`, it returns:\n\n```\nRepository extras is listed more than once in the configuration\nError: \nProblem: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: setup\n(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)\n\n```\n\nI'm not convinced I need to care about that though. With the repo's disabled, I can't foresee an issue arising here. (But it would be nice to remove it for completions sake.)\n\n\\-\\- edit: Review \\-\\-\n\nI have established one reason to move/remove the *.repo files \\- `yum` / `dnf` don't like it when these files have repo\\= the same in two files. I simply moved the CentOS\\-Stream* files into a new subdirectory and `chmod`'d that directory as 000 so it didn't see them.

You should model for the relationships you care about or are useful to you. The relationship of roles to users is more of an implementation detail and not something worth modelling at all at a code level, let the database handle the consistency. Knowing all the users in a role seems like more of a user search capability than anything useful in working with a role.\n\nIn either case you really don't want to model both directions of a many to many case in code at the same time, because you will run into circular reference and consistency issues.
