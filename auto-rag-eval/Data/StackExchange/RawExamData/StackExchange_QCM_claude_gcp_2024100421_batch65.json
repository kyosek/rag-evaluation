Counts per second for 10 different distances (each spaced 1 cm apart) were taken for preset times ranging from 200 to 2000 seconds (depending on how far the source is from the counter). \n\n**Objective and Question:** We are plotting counts per second vs source\\-to\\-counter distance for our sample, which emits beta radiation. We expect it to be $\\\\frac{1}{r^2}$ dependance by the inverse square law, however we are getting less than $\\\\frac{1}{r^2}$ dependance for larger distances (i.e) we are getting fewer counts than predicted by the inverse square law. At first we thought it was the air particles interacting with the beta particles, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it (according to the instructor), and the lab question hints it should have something to do with the geometry of the experiment. Can someone please help me understand this problem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reason why the inverse square law doesn't hold for a beta emitter is due to the fact that with a beta emitter we are dealing with a whole energy spectrum of beta particles (ranging from 0 eV to the maximum beta energy; in this case 2\\.28 MeV for 90Y). The low\\-energy betas are absorbed in the intermediate layer of air and the further you get from the source the more betas are absorbed by the air until you reach the maximum range in air (for the maximum beta energy 2\\.28 MeV of 90Y this range is 8\\.8 meter, for the maximum beta energy 0\\.546 MeV of 90Sr this range is 2 meter) and all betas are absorbed. The inverse square law for a beta emitter is valid up to approx. 30 cm in air, at greater distances the inverse square law deviates further and further.\n\nNote: because the half\\-life of the daughter 90Y (64 hours) is very much shorter than that of the mother 90Sr (29 years), there is absolute equilibrium between mother and daughter, i.e. the activity of the daughter 90Y is equal to that of the mother 90Sr."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is conducting an experiment with a beta-emitting radioactive source (90Sr/90Y) and a Geiger counter. They measure the counts per second at various distances from 1 cm to 100 cm. Which of the following best explains why the observed count rate deviates from the inverse square law at larger distances?\n\nA) The inverse square law is only applicable to gamma radiation, not beta radiation.\n\nB) The Geiger counter becomes less efficient at detecting beta particles at greater distances.\n\nC) Low-energy beta particles are increasingly absorbed by air at greater distances, causing a deviation from the inverse square law.\n\nD) The decay of 90Sr into 90Y changes the energy spectrum of emitted particles at greater distances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The inverse square law doesn't hold perfectly for beta emitters at larger distances due to the absorption of low-energy beta particles by air. Beta radiation consists of a spectrum of energies, and the low-energy particles are more easily absorbed by air molecules. As the distance increases, more of these low-energy particles are absorbed before reaching the detector, causing the observed count rate to fall off more rapidly than predicted by the inverse square law alone.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the inverse square law applies to all types of radiation in principle, but other factors (like air absorption) can cause deviations.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the efficiency of the Geiger counter itself doesn't significantly change with distance in this scenario.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while 90Sr does decay into 90Y, this doesn't change with distance and both are in equilibrium, contributing to a constant energy spectrum."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/21", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/387502", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/163665/"], "docs_id": 387502, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to disable the bluetooth at boot, without blacklisting the kernel module.\n\nI commented the following two lines in the `/etc/init/bluetooth.conf`:\n\n```\nstart on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\n\n```\n\nThen I added:\n\n```\nstop on runlevel [0123456]\n\n```\n\nIn the file `/etc/init.d/bluetooth`, wright before the `exit 0`, I added the line:\n\n```\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\n```\n\nNone of those try succeeded.\n\nI saw on the Internet to add the last command in the `/etc/rc.local` file.

The code provided by me also is not really high\\-performing, because iterating over many tokens of the argument takes place.*\n\nAbout TeX\\-jargon:\n\n* TeX's eyes translate characters to TeX's internal character\\-representation\\-scheme (which with traditional TeX is ASCII (8bit) and with XeTeX/LuaTeX is unicode) and pass them to TeX's mouth where tokenization takes place. The internal character\\-representation\\-scheme can be seen as a function where the characters are the domain and the code\\-point\\-numbers are the range/codomain.  \n\nCategory codes refer to characters before tokenization, not to character\\-tokens. The category\\-code\\-r\u00e9gime can be seen as a function where the characters (determined by their code\\-point\\-number in the TeX\\-engine's internal character\\-representation\\-scheme) are the domain and the category codes are the codomain. Category codes in turn determine the action that shall be triggered when, in the stage of tokenization, a character of the respective category code is encountered.\n* Thus, strictly spoken, character tokens don't have category codes. They have categories. And character codes. \"Category\" and \"character code\" are properties of a specific character token that got inserted into the token\\-stream. The values of these properties are determined in the course of tokenizing in TeX's mouth. During tokenization the category is determined by applying the catcode\\-r\u00e9gime\\-function to the character and \"seeing\" what action the character shall trigger. In many cases the action to be triggered is creating and appending to the token\\-stream a character\\-token of the respective category and with a character\\-code which is determined by applying the internal character\\-representation\\-scheme\\-function to the character. The token\\-stream in turn goes down TeX's gullet where in a process of regurgitation expansion of expandable tokens takes place. After that unexpandable tokens (and expandable tokens whose expansion was suppressed) reach the stomach for further processing, e.g., performing assignments, creating boxes, ... The category of a character token determines the treatment of that character token and the actions it triggers in the stage of expansion and in later stages.\n* There is this \"expansion\\-thingie\" in TeX: Expanding a macro\\-token \"returns\" the macro\\-token's toplevel\\-expansion, not the final result of the expansion\\-cascade.  \n\nThus when describing desired output, please be specific about what you mean by \"return\", i.e., tell\n\t+ whether the result to be \"returned\" is to be a sequence of tokens or to be a page of a .dvi/.pdf\\-output\\-file or to be a message on the terminal or ...\n\t+ in case of wishing to obtain a sequence of tokens: whether expandability is required (and if so: about the amount of expansion\\-steps to be triggered for obtaining the tokens that form the result\u2014with complex macro\\-mechanisms based on `\\romannumeral`\\-expansion you need to trigger at least two expansion\\-steps for obtaining the result) or \"side\\-effects\" like defining temporary macros/scratch\\-macros are allowed.\n\n---\n\nMacro arguments hold explicit character tokens of category 1(begin group) in the same amount as explicit character tokens of category 2(end group).\n\n---\n\n\"Off\\-the\\-cuff\"\\-outline:\n\nBoth the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token and the routine for finding/stringifying the matching explicit category\\-2\\-character\\-token iterate and remove the first component from the argument (which either is an explicit space\\-token of category 10 and character code 32 or is an undelimited argument itself) until either the argument is empty or the argument has a leading explicit character token of category 1\\.\n\nIn case of emptiness the routines are done without returning any tokens as there are no explicit category 1/2 tokens in the argument.\n\nIn case of having reduced the argument to something that has a leading explicit character token of category 1,\n\n* the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token hits that token with `\\string`, then prepends another opening\\-brace and then extracts the first component of the first component of the argument, using an extraction\\-routine which takes explicit space tokens into account.\n* the routine for finding/stringifying the matching explicit category\\-2\\-character\\-token does a loop where both the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token\nand the routine for extracting the first component of the argument, which takes explicit space tokens into account, are used:\n\n\"Lay hands\" on the first component of the argument (which is known not to be a space, but something nested inside a brace\\-group) for checking if that first component is empty.\n\nIf the first component of the argument is empty, there is something like `{}etc etc`. In this case stringify the opening brace, remove it (taking into account that stringification might have yielded a space\\-token), hit the closing brace with `\\string` and extract the first component from the result, using the extraction\\-routine which takes explicit space tokens into account. Terminate, returnig the result of the extraction.\n\nIf the first component of the argument is not empty, there is something like `{<stuff>}etc etc`. In this situation you get four cases by two checks:  \n\nCheck 1: Use the routine for finding/stringifying the first explicit category\\-1\\-character\\-token for checking if stringification of the argument's first token yields an explicit space\\-token.  \n\nCheck 2: Check if the first component of the argument, which is the content of the brace\\-group `{<stuff>}`, has a leading space.  \n\nDepending on the result of these checks: Stringify the opening brace and remove it either as a space\\-token or as an undelimited argument, then remove the following component either as space\\-token or as undelimited argument and then prepend an opening\\-brace.

`\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified` and `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBracesMatchingClosingBraceStringified` LaTeX macros?\n\nA) Both macros always return a catcode-12 character token, regardless of the input.\n\nB) The `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified` macro returns the first category-1 character token, while `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBracesMatchingClosingBraceStringified` returns the matching category-2 character token.\n\nC) These macros only work with ASCII characters and fail with Unicode input.\n\nD) The macros require the use of \u03b5-TeX extensions or Lua to function properly.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption A is incorrect because the macros don't always return a catcode-12 character token. They return the result of applying `\\string` to the relevant character token, which may produce different results depending on the input.\n\nOption B is correct. The `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBraceStringified` macro is designed to find and stringify the first explicit category-1 (opening brace) character token in the input that is not a control sequence or active character. The `\\UD@ExtractFirstOpeningBracesMatchingClosingBraceStringified` macro finds and stringifies the matching category-2 (closing brace) character token.\n\nOption C is incorrect. The documentation doesn't mention any limitations regarding Unicode input. In fact, it states that the internal character representation scheme with XeTeX/LuaTeX is Unicode.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The documentation explicitly states: \"Running the code does not require \u03b5-TeX-extensions or Lua-extensions or the like.\"\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates understanding of the macros' functionality and purpose, which is crucial for working with complex TeX/LaTeX code involving category codes and character tokens."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/10", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/217803", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/95863/"], "docs_id": 217803, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the following paragraph, i don't get the meaning of the last part \"I would argue, should you always feel you must.\" Any possible explanation will be appreciated. \n\n> The truth is that the human mind is far more complex than any \u201csecret.\u201d And you can\u2019t simply change yourself; nor, I would argue, should you always feel you must.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general when a person say or write \"I would argue\" it means that the person thinks that what s/he says is true, but does not claim that it is clearly proved. often the person offers reason \\-\\- arguments \\-\\- to support the view, but sometimes only implies that such arguments exist and could be brought forward. The implication is that the person making the statement would be prepared to defend the statement in some sort of debate, but that a differing view is legitimate enough that it could also be argued. \n\nIn the sentence:\n\n> And you can\u2019t simply change yourself; nor, I would argue, should you always feel you must.\n\nthe writer is saying that a person can't easily or automatically change himself or herself, **and** that a person should not always even feel some sort of need or obligation to make a change. The placement of the phrase \"I would argue\" means that the writer is stating he fist part \\-\\- that a person cant just change easily \\-\\- as absolute fact. The second part, the writer is saying is more of an opinion, but the writer thinks that there are good reasons to support the opinion that a person need not feel a need to change.\n\nIt happens that I am rather fond of the phrase \"I would argue\" and use it with some frequency, so I have some experience in how to use it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of using the phrase \"I would argue\" in academic or formal writing?\n\nA) To assert an opinion as an undisputable fact\nB) To present a viewpoint while acknowledging potential counterarguments\nC) To avoid taking responsibility for a controversial statement\nD) To indicate that the writer is unsure about their own position\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"I would argue\" is used to present a viewpoint or opinion that the writer believes to be true and can support with reasons, while simultaneously acknowledging that it may not be universally accepted or definitively proven. It suggests that the writer is open to debate and recognizes the legitimacy of differing views. This approach is commonly used in academic and formal writing to present arguments in a balanced and nuanced manner.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"I would argue\" actually softens an assertion rather than presenting it as undisputable fact. Option C is incorrect because the phrase is used to take a stance, not to avoid responsibility. Option D is incorrect because the phrase typically indicates confidence in one's position, even if it's presented as debatable, rather than uncertainty."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/11/03", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2502497", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/346385/"], "docs_id": 2502497, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For the purpose of field extensions, and other field properties, is there a program capable of computing\n\n$2^{16983000\\*94351^{70}}$ $\\\\pmod {6661\\*94351^{71}}$\n\n$3^{16983000\\*94351^{70}}$ $\\\\pmod {6661\\*94351^{71}}$\n\nPlease give examples of some.

What does this result suggest about the multiplicative order of 2 and 3 in the multiplicative group of integers modulo (6661*94351^71)?\n\nA) The multiplicative order of both 2 and 3 is exactly 16983000*94351^70\nB) The multiplicative order of both 2 and 3 must be a divisor of 16983000*94351^70\nC) The multiplicative order of 2 and 3 must be coprime to 6661*94351^71\nD) The multiplicative order of 2 and 3 must be larger than 16983000*94351^70\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: When an integer a raised to the power n is congruent to 1 modulo m, it means that the multiplicative order of a modulo m must divide n.

Jolenealaska indicates that this was still common in the late 70s. \n\nThis in fact represented literary practice in the 19th century, and a primary object of schoolteachers has always been to encourage use of prestige forms\u2014what used to be called \u2018proper English\u2019\u2014and to stamp out non\\-standard forms.\n\nSince the middle of the 19th century, however, *may* has been giving way to *can* in permissions, and it is my impression that schoolteachers have pretty much given up that particular fight. Nonetheless, the 'rule' still prevails in formal, written English\u2020; and there are lots of people out there (many in very senior positions) who I adhere to the rule.\n\nI consequently recommend that you observe this distinction in any formal writing you undertake if you have any hope of becoming a Recognized Authority (at which point, of course, you may write anything you please).

Consequently, during the years you are learning the dialect you are working entirely with texts older than you are yourself, or written by authors who are older; and by the time you master the language, and start publishing your own texts you are yourself older than many or most of your readers.\n* It is not only a much richer language lexically, it is a much more complex one syntactically, because it must express more complex ideas with more precision and writers have no opportunity to interrupt their discourses to explain what readers have not understood. It has many more 'rules' to ensure that what you say is what you mean and cannot be understood to mean something else.

Specifically, when dealing with a Spring / Springboot / Seam project, what benefit is there to having a separate implementation and interface class for a bean and having them in the same package and module?\n\nFor example, if I have (for a Seam application):\n\n```\npublic interface MyRepository {}\n\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n@Name(\"myRepository\")\npublic class MyRepositoryImpl implements MyRepository {\n    //impl\n}\n\n```\n\nwouldn't any project that can acess the MyRepository interface also already be injecting the implementation class?

If your repository implements an interface, and your application consumes the repository as an interface rather than concrete implementation, then it is easier to isolate parts of your application that require data access. Your unit tests can mock the repository by injecting a TestMyRepository object, which implements the same interface.\n\nSo it is not really about the application using only one implementation. It allows you to create a second implementation for testing purposes. It is easy to forget that mock or stub objects are also concrete implementations. Mocks and stubs exist to facilitate testing rather than actual data access."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Spring/Spring Boot project, what is the primary benefit of having separate interface and implementation classes for a repository bean in the same package and module?\n\nA) To improve application performance by allowing lazy loading of implementations\nB) To facilitate easier unit testing by enabling mock implementations\nC) To enforce strict encapsulation of repository methods\nD) To enable runtime switching between different repository implementations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The main benefit of having separate interface and implementation classes for repository beans is to facilitate easier unit testing. This separation allows developers to create mock implementations of the repository interface for testing purposes. By consuming the repository as an interface rather than a concrete implementation, parts of the application that require data access can be easily isolated and tested. This approach enables the injection of test implementations (like TestMyRepository) that implement the same interface, making it simpler to write and maintain unit tests without relying on actual data access.\n\nOption A is incorrect because separating interfaces and implementations doesn't directly impact performance or lazy loading.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while interfaces can help with encapsulation, this isn't the primary reason for this pattern in the context of repositories.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although this pattern could potentially allow for switching implementations, this isn't typically done at runtime and isn't the main benefit in Spring/Spring Boot projects."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/05/30", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/361747", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/150264/"], "docs_id": 361747, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let me discuss two possible constructions of Gaussian measures on infinite dimensional spaces.

A measurable space $(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F})$ is a set $\\\\Omega$ equipped with a $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\mathcal{F}$. A measure $\\\\mu$ on the measurable space $(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F})$ is a map from $\\\\mathcal{F}$ to $\\[0,\\\\infty]$ satisfying the usual axioms. From now on I will only talk about probability measures.\nFor best behavior, the $\\\\Omega$ should be a (nice) topological space and $\\\\mathcal{F}$ should be the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra for that topology. Suppose one has two topological spaces $X,Y$ and a continuous injective map $\\\\tau:X\\\\rightarrow Y$. Then if $\\\\mu$ is a measure on $(X,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X)$ where $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X$ is the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra of $X$, then one can construct the direct image/push forward measure $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ on $(Y,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_Y)$ by letting\n$$\n\\\\forall B\\\\in\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{Y},\\\\ \n(\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu)(B):\\=\\\\mu(\\\\tau^{\\-1}(B))\\\\ .\n$$\nThis is well defined because a continuous map like $\\\\tau$ is also $(\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X,\\\\mathcal{B}\\_Y)$\\-measurable. Technically speaking $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ are different measures because they are on different spaces. However, one could argue that they are *morally* the same. For example, one might be given the measure $\\\\tau\\_{\\\\ast}\\\\mu$ without knwing that it is of that form, and only later realize that it is and thus lives on the smaller set $\\\\tau(X)$ inside $Y$.\n\n**The first construction:**\n\nLet $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of multi\\-sequences of fast decay $f\\=(f\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$, i.e., the ones for which\n$$\n\\\\forall k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, \\|\\|f\\|\\|\\_k:\\=\\\\sup\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\langle x\\\\rangle^k\\|f\\_x\\|\\\\ \\<\\\\infty\n$$\nwhere $\\\\langle x\\\\rangle\\=\\\\sqrt{1\\+x\\_1^2\\+\\\\cdots\\+x\\_d^2}$.\nPut on the vector space $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ the locally convex topology defined by the collection of seminorms $\\|\\|\\\\cdot\\|\\|\\_k$, $k\\\\ge 0$.\nThe strong dual can be concretely realized as the space $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ of multi\\-sequences of temperate growth. Namely, $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of discrete fields $\\\\phi\\=(\\\\phi\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ such that\n$$\n\\\\exists k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\exists K\\\\ge 0,\\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d,\\\\ \\|\\\\phi\\_x\\|\\\\le K\\\\langle x\\\\rangle^k\\\\ .\n$$\nThe vector space $s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is given the locally convex topology generated by the seminorms\n$\\|\\|\\\\phi\\|\\|\\_{\\\\rho}\\=\\\\sum\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\rho\\_x\\\\ \\|\\\\phi\\_x\\|$\nwhere $\\\\rho$ ranges over elements of $s(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with nonnegative values.\n\nThe measure $\\\\mu\\_C$ obtained via the Bochner\\-Minlos Theorem is a measure on $X\\=s'(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with its Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_X$.\n\n**The second construction:**\n\nLet $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$ made of multi\\-sequences of finite support $f\\=(f\\_x)\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$, i.e., the ones for which\n$f\\_x\\=0$ outside some finite set $\\\\Lambda\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{Z}^d$. Put on the vector space $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ the finest locally convex topology. Namely, this is the locally convex topology\ngenerated by the collection of *all* seminorms on $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ .\nNote that $s\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)\\\\simeq \\\\oplus\\_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $s'\\_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ be the strong topological dual realized concretely as $\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d}$.

Why does this matter? In older PICs there are no instructions for reading data from ROM, so a method was developed called Table Read, in which data arrays are stored as a sequence of RETLW instructions (return from subroutine with literal in working register). \n\nThe 12F1501 is one of the new generation of enhanced mid range PICs which can use their index register to read the ROM directly, so it has no restrictions on placement of data in the ROM. However the XC8 compiler still insists on trying to align `stringtext` on page boundaries, and refuses to put it in page zero even when only a few bytes of initialization code are 'in the way'! This may result in running out of space even though you have a significant amount of 'free' ROM.\n\nThe easiest way around this problem is to simply force your arrays into a code section \\- then the compiler should align them on word boundaries with no gaps (like normal code). Just add a section specifier to each array definition, like this:\\- \n\n```\nconst __section(\"mystringtext\") unsigned char patterns[12] = {\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n};    \n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with the XC8 compiler for PIC microcontrollers, which of the following statements is true regarding the placement of constant data arrays in ROM?\n\nA) The stringtext psect must always be placed in the first half of each program memory page for all PIC microcontrollers.\n\nB) For newer PIC microcontrollers like the 12F1501, constant data arrays can be placed anywhere in ROM without restrictions.\n\nC) The XC8 compiler always aligns stringtext on page boundaries and never places it in page zero, potentially wasting ROM space.\n\nD) Using the __section() specifier with constant arrays allows the compiler to align them on word boundaries with no gaps, potentially saving ROM space.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because this restriction only applies to 'baseline' PICs like the 12C509, not all PICs.\nB is partially true for newer PICs, but the XC8 compiler still imposes some restrictions.\nC is partially true, but it's not always the case and doesn't provide a solution.\nD is correct and provides a workaround for the compiler's behavior, allowing more efficient use of ROM space by treating the constant arrays more like code sections."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/10/30", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/64615250", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/10809859/"], "docs_id": 64615250, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Data will be received from clients, with different formats, in an Excel file.\n\nUsually the file will have more than three sheets and multiple columns in each sheet.

You need to turn this into a filter that checks if *all* the predicates are satisfied. We can do by using [**`all :: Foldable f => (b -> Bool) -> f b -> Bool`**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:all). Here the `b` for the `all` function is a function `a -> Bool`, and thus the type of the function `(b -> Bool)` is `(a -> Bool) -> Bool`. We do this by *calling* each function on that element:\n\n```\nfilters :: [a] -> [a -> Bool] -> [a]\nfilters xs fs = filter (\\x -> all ($ x) fs) xs\n```\n\nwe can further generalize the signature to:\n\n```\nfilters :: Foldable f => [a] -> f (a -> Bool) -> [a]\nfilters xs fs = filter (\\x -> all ($ x) fs) xs\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given the code snippet from the StackExchange answer:\n\n```haskell\nfilters :: [a] -> [a -> Bool] -> [a]\nfilters xs fs = filter (\\x -> all ($ x) fs) xs\n```\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct about this implementation of the `filters` function?\n\nA) The function applies each predicate in `fs` to every element in `xs`, returning only the elements that satisfy at least one predicate.\n\nB) The function uses lazy evaluation to optimize performance by short-circuiting the evaluation of predicates.\n\nC) The function applies all predicates in `fs` to each element in `xs`, returning only the elements that satisfy all predicates.\n\nD) The function is not type-safe and will cause a runtime error if `fs` is empty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

If that difference is a whole number of wave lengths $\\\\lambda$ then these waves will show positive reinforcing interference.

In both cases, the difference in path length (\u0394L) between two rays determines whether constructive or destructive interference occurs. For X-ray diffraction, this path difference is determined by the spacing between crystal planes (D) and the angle of incidence (\u03b1). For optical diffraction gratings, it depends on the spacing between reflective areas (D) and the angles of incidence (\u03b1) and reflection (\u03b2). While the underlying principle of wave interference is the same, the specific geometries and materials involved differ between the two phenomena.

The etymology of the word is actually that it\u2019s a shortened form of the word *alts\u00e5* (which means something like \"therefore\", \"thus\", or *\"verily\"*, the latter sense being where the slang meaning derives from.)\n\nExample:\n\n```\nJeg liker det  ikke, ass.\nI   like  that not   ????\n\n```\n\nWhich means, \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d The purpose of the word *ass* is hard to explain, but it sort of adds some sincerity to the sentence.

A bit like English *indeed*, but *indeed* doesn\u2019t work for a negative statement like this, and it certainly doesn\u2019t work for informal language.\n\nThe word is extremely common in spoken Norwegian, especially among young people.\n\nSome more examples:\n\n> Jeg vet ikke, *ass*.

I realize that I could just use nothing, since the word carries only **some** meaning and is not that crucial, but I still feel it would be better to use **something**, to capture the feeling of the sentence.\n\nSo I know about *man* or even the word *dude*.

It\u2019s more like a laid\\-back word like *dude*. You\u2019re not **that** passionate about what you\u2019re saying, but you do mean in. *Ass* at the end means that you mean what you\u2019re saying. A bit like *really*. But it\u2019s also a laidback word, you can certainly say it while speaking in a lazy or careless tone. Also, it\u2019s used *very* frequently in informal Norwegian, so it\u2019s a bit watered down. The word it derives from, *alts\u00e5* (thus, therefore, verily), **could** be used in the same way, but hardly any young people do so in informal contexts, and it sounds old\\-fashioned.\n\nI found the [definition of *alts\u00e5*](http://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=alts%C3%A5&ant_bokmaal=5&ant_nynorsk=5&begge=%20&ordbok=begge) in a Norwegian dictionary:\n\n> ### Forsterkende:\n> \n> \n> * Det er helt sant, alts\u00e5!\n> * Han er veldig kjekk, alts\u00e5!\n\nWhich means:\n\n> ### Reinforcing:\n> \n> \n> * It\u2019s completely true, verily!\n> * He is very handsome, verily!\n\nI guess I should just use *verily* in the subtitles. That sounds, like, *so* casual, for real.\n\nPlease note that *alts\u00e5* is perhaps not *as* old\\-fashioned in Norwegian as *verily* is in English. (I believe *verily* is **extremely** old\\-fashioned and perhaps even pompous in English?) However, *alts\u00e5* **is** still somewhat old\\-fashioned.\n\nTo break down the word *alts\u00e5* even more, its etymology is *alt* (all, everything) \\+ *s\u00e5* (so).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **When subtitling, this word is God's gift to you!**\n\nHere's your predicament as I see it: you are bound to render speech, presumably casual dialogue, in subtitles. A word that seems to be a cross between an epistemic intensifier and a filler keeps being repeated. It has no obvious counterpart in the target language, but a lot of good renderings exist. The main point appears to be to sound colloquial.\n\nMy advice: **Do not try to translate the word**, especially not by making a list of possible English renderings and alternating between them. **Just translate the meaning.** If the meaning and style (and *not* the original wording in Norwegian) call for \"man\" or \"you see\", etc., then by all means put it in (even if the source phrase does not contain \"ass\"). \n\nI'm sure you are already doing that, but \"ass\" keeps bothering you. \nIt would be a serious problem in dubbing (as your audience would be lip\\-reading). With subtitles, you want to be **minimalistic**; you may need to put less than the original while being truthful to it. So personally I'd be very happy and try to put all the colloquial, buddy\\-buddy feel of the conversation into the wording of the phrase itself.\n\nSo \n\n> \"Jeg vet ikke, ass.\"  \n> \n> *No idea.*  \n> \n>  or (if you must)  \n> \n> *Really, no idea.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When subtitling a Norwegian TV show that frequently uses the colloquial term \"ass\" at the end of sentences, what is the best approach for translating this term into English?\n\nA) Always translate \"ass\" as \"man\" or \"dude\" to maintain consistency\nB) Create a list of English equivalents like \"really,\" \"honestly,\" \"seriously\" and rotate between them\nC) Translate \"ass\" literally as \"verily\" in all instances to capture its etymological roots\nD) Focus on conveying the overall meaning and tone of the sentence rather than directly translating \"ass\"\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The best approach when subtitling is to focus on conveying the overall meaning and tone of the sentence rather than trying to directly translate the Norwegian term \"ass\". This word serves as a casual intensifier that doesn't have a direct English equivalent. Attempting to consistently translate it with specific words like \"man\" or \"dude\" could lead to unnatural dialogue, especially when considering gender and group conversations. Similarly, rotating through a list of English intensifiers or using the literal but outdated \"verily\" would not capture the casual, colloquial nature of the original dialogue. Instead, the subtitler should aim to convey the informal tone and emphasis of the original sentence through the overall wording and structure of the English translation, without necessarily including a direct equivalent for \"ass\" in every instance."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/24", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/275636", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/54616/"], "docs_id": 275636, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Playing with 16 cards. 4 A, 4 K, 4 Q, and 4 J; \n\nDeal 8 2 card hands.

Mark the $q\\=4$ queens in the deck and deal them randomly into those $n$ places. \n\nLet's say that a \"pattern\" is a vector $p\\=(p\\_1, p\\_2, \\\\ldots, p\\_k)$ in which $p\\_i$ counts how many of the groups contain exactly $i$ queens. For example:\n\n* Two hands with two queens gives the pattern $p\\=(0,2\\)$.\n* One hand with a pair of queens and two single\\-queen hands gives the pattern $p\\=(2,1\\)$.\n* Four single\\-queen hands gives $p\\=(4,0\\)$.\n\nNotice that each $p\\_i$ is between $0$ and $m$, the sum of the $p\\_i$ cannot exceed $m$, and $1p\\_1 \\+ 2p\\_2 \\+ \\\\cdots \\+ kp\\_k \\= q$ because it counts the total number of queens.\n\n**We're practically done:**\n\n1. There are $\\\\binom{n}{q}$ possible subsets of the $n$ places that will correspond to the locations of the $q$ queens.\n2. Count the number of ways to create a pattern $p$ by starting with the largest possible counts of queens and working down:\n\n\t* There are $\\\\binom{m}{p\\_k}$ ways of choosing the $p\\_k$ hands that will contain $k$ queens. All are equally probable.\n\t* After those hands are selected, there remain $m\\-p\\_k$ hands and therefore, *conditional* on selecting the hands with $k$ queens, there are $\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}$ ways of selecting the hands with $k\\-1$ queens. Within each of those hands, independently, there are $\\\\binom{k}{k\\-1}$ ways of selecting which cards are the queens. Thus, $$\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\binom{k}{k\\-1}^{p\\_{k\\-1}}$$ counts the possible arrangements.\n\t* Proceed in the same manner for indexes $i$ from $k$ down through $1$. **The total number of possible ways to distribute the queens to create pattern $p$ is the product of the individual counts, equal to** $$\\\\binom{m}{p\\_k}\\\\cdot\\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k}{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\binom{k}{k\\-1}^{p\\_{k\\-1}}\\\\cdots \\\\binom{m\\-p\\_k\\-\\\\cdots\\-p\\_2}{p\\_1}\\\\binom{k}{1}^{p\\_{1}}.$$\n\nDividing (2\\) by (1\\) gives the desired probabilities.\n\nIn the example of the question,\n\n* Two hands with two queens, $p\\=(0,2\\)$, occur with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{2}}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{1}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.01538462\\.$$\n* $p\\=(2,1\\)$ occurs with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{1}\\\\binom{7}{2}\\\\binom{2}{1}^2}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{24}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.36923077\\.$$\n* $p\\=(4,0\\)$ occurs with probability $$\\\\frac{\\\\binom{8}{4}\\\\binom{2}{1}^4}{\\\\binom{16}{4}} \\= \\\\frac{40}{65} \\\\approx 0\\.61538462\\.$$\n\n---\n\n**Let's check with a simulation.** Here are the results of 10,000 computer\\-generated deals as output by the following `R` program:\n\n```\n               0,2    2,1    4,0\nsimulation 0.01600 0.3731 0.6109\ntheory     0.01538 0.3692 0.6154\n\n```\n\nThe agreement is excellent.\n\n```\n#\n# Specify the problem.\n#\nm <- 8\nk <- 2\nq <- 4\n#\n# Create a data structure.\n#\nn <- m*k\nDeck <- c(rep(1,q), rep(0, n-q))\n#\n# Perform a simulation.\n#\nset.seed(17)\np <- replicate(1e4, {\n  paste(tabulate(colSums(matrix(sample(Deck, n), k)), k), collapse=\",\")\n})\n#\n# Theory.\n#\nf <- function(p, m, k){\n  p <- rev(p[1:k])\n  n <- m*k\n  q <- sum(k:1 * p)\n  a <- m - c(0, cumsum(p[-k]))\n  exp(sum(lchoose(a, p) + lchoose(k, 0:(k-1))*p) - lchoose(n,q))\n}\n#\n# Summarize the simulation.\n#\nsimulation <- table(p) / length(p)\ntheory <- sapply(names(simulation), function(s) {\n  eval(parse(text=paste0(\"f(c(\", s, \"), \", m, \", \", k, \")\")))\n})\n#\n# Compare to theory.\n#\nsignif(rbind(simulation, theory), 4)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a card game, 16 cards are used: 4 Aces, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, and 4 Jacks.

The design uses a resistor\\-divider network and then a unity op\\-amp. The signal is appropriately scaled but there appears to be a ton of ripple / noise in the output. The input signal is \\-1V to 1V @ 100 KHz and output is a motion control DAC.\n\nI am using a TI OPA188 OpAmp with a \\+12V / \\-12V power supply. On both power supplies I have a 1uF ceramic, 100 uF electrolytic and 10 uF tantalum capacitor, and then directly next to the OPA188 I have 0\\.1uF decoupling capacitor. The schematic is this (note the part is OPA188 not OPA140\\):\n\n[![Schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oA4L6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oA4L6.png)\n\nThoughts:\n\n* Do I need to do something with the power (filter?) from the switching power supplies (TDK\\-Lambda LS25\\-12\\)?\n* I do not have a resistor or capacitor on the feedback from op amp output to negative. Does that cause instability? Ditto with the output \\- I drive the output directly to the remote ADC, no resistor. Error?\n* Did I make a poor choice \\- is this op amp not suited to unity gain buffer?\n\nThe noise is periodic, at least 200 mV pk\\-pk (a deal\\-killer as noise like that is directly picked up by the ADC control circuit). The output cable is a typical BNC 50 Ohm cable, \\~3' long, high impedance ADC controller at the other end.\n\nAdded \\- picture of noise (op\\-amp \\-\\> 3' BNC cable \\-\\> scope):\n[![scope](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3KfBP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3KfBP.jpg)\n\nAdded \\- picture of \\-12V power rail and op\\-amp output\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dG9Vm.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dG9Vm.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think you chose the wrong opamp, at least not based on what you are showing here. It looks like power supply noise to me based on the obvious correlation between supply and output. Also the noise is periodic at about 15\\-20ms which would match 50/60hz.\n\nOpamps have a specification **power supply rejection ratio**, which says how well the opamp can isolate the output from the power supply. Looking at the datasheet for this opamp, PSRR is very good, about 140dB, but that is at DC and PSRR is frequency dependent. \n\nLooking at your second picture, I see about 1V p\\-p noise on the power rail, and 20mV on the output (not 200mV \\- wrong probe setting?). You are seeing maybe 35dB PSRR in this configuration, from 1V to 20mV. Looking at Fig 12 in the datasheet (PSRR vs Frequency) this ratio happens around 10\\-100kHz. It wouldn't be surprising if you have that sort of noise on your power rail, switching converters typically run 50khz upwards.\n\nYou should probably add some filtering on both power rails to ground using L\\-C filters. There is no easy answer on what exactly to use and it may not be simple to do this 'properly' \\- [this PDF](https://designers-guide.org/design/bypassing.pdf) has some good information. However if it were me, I would grab some power inductors and capacitors, check the cutoff frequency using [the formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit), and give it a try to see if it helps reduce the noise. For example I might try 22uH/47uF for 5kHz cutoff."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer designs a circuit to reduce an input signal by 10x using a resistor-divider network and a unity op-amp. The output shows significant periodic noise of about 20mV peak-to-peak, correlated with 1V peak-to-peak noise on the power rail. The op-amp used is an OPA188 with a datasheet-specified PSRR of 140dB at DC. What is the most likely cause of this noise and the best approach to mitigate it?\n\nA) The op-amp is unsuitable for unity gain configuration. Replace it with a different model.\nB) The noise is caused by insufficient decoupling capacitors. Add more capacitors near the op-amp power pins.\nC) The noise is power supply related, likely from switching converters. Add L-C filters on both power rails.\nD) The issue is caused by lack of feedback resistor. Add a 10k resistor in the feedback loop.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The periodic nature of the noise and its correlation with the power rail strongly suggest power supply noise as the source. While the op-amp has excellent PSRR at DC (140dB), this drops significantly at higher frequencies (to about 35dB in this case). The noise is likely coming from switching power supplies operating in the 10-100kHz range. Adding L-C filters on both power rails would help reduce this high-frequency noise before it reaches the op-amp. Options A and D are incorrect as the op-amp choice and feedback configuration are not the primary issues. While option B (adding more decoupling capacitors) might help somewhat, it doesn't address the root cause as effectively as L-C filtering."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/24", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/73972", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/26797/"], "docs_id": 73972, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to know how a native speaker would say that someone tries to smile, however hard it may be for this person to do so (because he is embarrassed, or because he simply is reluctant to smile at something which he does not find particularly funny).

I'll be adding some of the most notable quest categories and the quests under those categories related to your question:\n\n### Quests to Do As Soon As Possible\n\n* [Blood on the Ice](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blood_on_the_Ice)  \n\n**Why**: The Necromancer Amulet is a Legendary\\-quality item very useful for low\\-level spellcasting characters, especially those interested in Conjuration, and can be sold for a lot of gold for a low\\-level character. There are numerous glitches associated with this quest, and the best fix is to start the quest as soon as possible and complete it all at once.\n* [The Forsworn Conspiracy](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forsworn_Conspiracy) and [No One Escapes Cidhna Mine](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_One_Escapes_Cidhna_Mine)  \n\n**Notes**: ...if you side with the Stormcloaks in the Civil War and if you complete Forsworn Conspiracy before Compelling Tribute and then wait until after Compelling Tribute to start Cidhna Mine, it will become unavailable permanently. It is also possible to have the same effect result from completing Forsworn Conspiracy, then completing Season Unending before Cidhna Mine, even if you have not joined the Stormcloaks.\n\n### Quests to Save for Later\n\n* [Dragon Rising](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Rising)  \n\n**Why**: Completing this quest early ensures a large number of Dragon Souls by exploring, if the player is capable of surviving the dragon's attacks.  \n\n**Why not**: After completing this quest, Skyrim will be full of dragons. Deferring it until you're in the mood to fight dragons lets you explore the world in relative peace and allows you to learn Words from Dragon Lairs more easily. Note that starting the quest will not cause dragons to appear; only after killing Mirmulnir will dragons start spawning.\n* [Joining the Stormcloaks](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Joining_the_Stormcloaks) or [Joining the Legion](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Joining_the_Legion)  \n\n**Why not**: Joining either the Stormcloaks or the Legion removes access to all the opposing faction's camps and causes \"random encounter\" fights to occur. Capturing towns has been known to break certain quests.\n\n### Quests that Conflict\n\n* [Lost to the Ages](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_to_the_Ages) (Dawnguard DLC) and [Mourning Never Comes](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mourning_Never_Comes)  \n\n**Why**: During Lost to the Ages, you are required to trek through Raldbthar, where Alain Dufont lives. If you kill him before starting Mourning Never Comes, you cannot kill Nilsine Shatter\\-Shield for the bonus reward in that quest.  \n\n**Why not**: Alain only becomes hostile if you attack him, he won't defend the other bandits in the area. You can kill all the bandits but Alain, and complete Lost to the Ages without affecting Mourning Never Comes.

Each automated test targets a \"customization\" our client ordered to modify an existing website.\n\nThe current flow is:\n\n1. `checkout development`\n2. `git pull`\n3. `checkout -b unique-customization-test-branch`\n4. *magic code stuffs*\n5. `git commit && git push`\n6. create pull request into dev\n\nEach automated test makes use of a `FooBar.groovy` library that I'm constantly updating, creating various functions to streamline the process of building these tests. Sometimes one of my teammates will need a new function added to `FooBar.groovy`, e.g. verify no duplicate rows exist in a table, and ask me to add that for them to use in their current branch / automated test.\n\nOf note: there's a no\\-pushing\\-to\\-dev policy in place, so right now what we're doing is:\n\n1. I checkout a new `FooBar` branch\n2. add function to the `FooBar.groovy` lib\n3. commit, push, and PR into dev\n4. my teammates run `git checkout origin/development -- FooBar.groovy` to get the latest changes\n\nBut then they have to either\n\n* discard the pulled changes to `FooBar.groovy` any time they switch branches to avoid conflicts and mucking the history, which is a hassle for the git savvy and nigh impossible without help for the git novices and often leads to `FooBar.groovy` accidentally getting committed in their test branch or\n* commit `FooBar.groovy` to their branch and just try to ensure that they've pulled the most recent version of it into their branch before creating the PR so as to not overwrite newer code\n\nThere *has* to be a better way. This seems super not\\-optimal. Any advice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like foobar.groovy should be an actual component not a source file that it checked in. In that case, turn it into a component with a separate repository and have each team or branch reference a version of that component that they need.\n\nThen it's just a matter of specifying which component version to use, just like any other dependency. Different branches use different versions. NPM install or similar the version your branch requires.\n\nAnother thing to consider if you don't want to go down the component route is those foobar.groovy changes should be in the same commit as the branch that the developer is working on. A commit is a single unit of work and that includes code, tests, and any changes to make all the tests work. Then after the the pull request is approved you can handle the merging of that test script as needed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is struggling with managing changes to a shared FooBar.groovy library file across multiple feature branches.
