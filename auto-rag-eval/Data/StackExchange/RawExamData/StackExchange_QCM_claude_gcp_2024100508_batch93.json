You can't updated db with it. You can send request to your server side script, which will update something in datatable.\n\nYou can find example of doing this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004233/jquery-ajax-post-example-with-php) or just [use google](https://www.google.ru/search?q=how%20to%20make%20ajax-request)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a PostgreSQL clustered database using Stado on two nodes, a user experiences slow query performance on the first run after server restart, but subsequent runs are fast.

This is a common occurrence in database systems, including PostgreSQL.\n\nWhen a query is first run, the database engine needs to parse the query, create an execution plan, and potentially read data from disk. These steps can be time-consuming. However, on subsequent runs, the database can utilize cached data and optimized query plans, resulting in faster performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if the Stado coordinator was improperly configured, it would likely cause consistent performance issues, not just on the first run.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the query complexity might affect overall performance, it doesn't explain the difference between the first and subsequent runs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because if the nodes' agents were not initialized correctly, it would likely cause ongoing issues, not just affect the first query after a restart.\n\nThe correct answer, C, best explains the observed behavior of slow initial performance followed by faster subsequent runs due to caching and optimization mechanisms in the database system."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/24", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/487928", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/235389/"], "docs_id": 487928, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If there is a fire in a building and I am on 10th floor and I can't exit the building.Is it safe to jump out of the window with a chair and when chair is close to the ground I just jump of the chair and I will be safe. Is this safe or not?

The chair needs to carry your and its own momentum downwards when you jump off it. Unfortunately that is a lot of momentum. And no human could push so hard off this chair (you'd have to accelerate the chair downwards probably with some 100's of km/h terminal velocity after full extension of your legs, because of the mass difference. Your legs would break). So no, it's not safe.\n\nA more interesting question could be: What mass of chair should you pick if you had different chairs available for maximum survival probability with increasing height of the jump (the chairs all being of the common \"vanishes on impact\" variety of course)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A person weighing 70 kg is trapped on the 10th floor of a burning building, approximately 30 meters high.

The method is unsafe because the force required to push off the chair and counteract the accumulated momentum would be far beyond human capabilities and would likely result in severe injury. \n\nOption A is incorrect because no amount of pushing off the chair just before impact would be sufficient to safely arrest the fall from such a height. \n\nOption B mentions the correct approximate momentum (1400 kg m/s) that would be acquired during the fall, but it's not possible for a person to safely counteract this momentum by pushing off a chair.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the mass of the chair would actually be relevant in calculating the overall momentum and potential outcomes, though it doesn't make the method safe regardless of its mass.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that the method is unsafe and provides a valid reason why - the extreme force required would cause severe injury, making this the best answer among the options provided."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/17", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1365097", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/255015/"], "docs_id": 1365097, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to answer this question: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, and let $f: M \\\\rightarrow M$ be a diffeomorphism.

The attached photo shows the \"drop\" for one of the in\\-floor units.\n\nIs this a typical practice when a zone has multiple drops?  \n\nI can see the benefit of this, in that each successive device doesn't lower the overall temperature as much as if they were \"one out, two in\" plumbed, and this also allows for more overall flow through the system rather than being restricted by the smaller devices, but it leaves me wondering how enough water goes through the individual devices, since it seems that it would be easier to keep flowing through the larger\\-diameter main loop than taking the 1/2\" route through the baseboard or whatever.\nThe loop pipe seems to be 1\", and the drops are 1/2\" copper. The overall system has a single circulator and zone valves for each thermostat\\-controlled zone.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Jzsp.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Jzsp.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, that is how modern hydronic heating systems are commonly set up. The main pipes are called the \"primary loop\" and each set of smaller piping to the radiators is called a \"secondary loop\". (The technique has been around since at least the 1950's, but it used to be limited mostly to commercial buildings. Its use in residential systems has become a lot more common in the last 20 years.)\n\nBoiler manufacturers want it done this way because the boiler is not designed to get back return water at too low a temperature. Yes, it sounds counterintuitive, I hear you thinking \\- isn't the whole point of the boiler to heat water? The problem is that if the temperature difference between the inside of the boiler and the returning water is too great, it will cause condensation inside the boiler which will ruin it.\n\nInstallers like to do it this way because it means you don't need to install lots of extra piping that would be required for a traditional \"header\\-type\" system with separate supply and return pipes.\n\nIt also means that you can turn on/off individual zones without affecting the overall system pressure too much.\n\nIf you want to know everything there is to know about Hydronic heating loops, Dan Holohan's website [HeatingHelp.com](https://heatinghelp.com) is a great place to start. Here is their article on [primary\\-secondary pumping](https://heatinghelp.com/systems-help-center/understanding-primary-secondary-pumping/). If you really want to go deep, Dan also wrote [an entire book](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0996477268) on the subject (as well as multiple other books about heating systems)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In modern hydronic heating systems, why is the primary-secondary loop configuration preferred over a traditional daisy-chain setup?\n\nA) It allows for easier installation of extra piping\nB) It prevents condensation in the boiler and allows for better zone control\nC) It increases the overall temperature of the system\nD) It reduces the diameter of the main loop pipes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary-secondary loop configuration is preferred in modern hydronic heating systems for several reasons:\n\n1. It prevents condensation in the boiler by ensuring that the return water temperature is not too low. If the temperature difference between the inside of the boiler and the returning water is too great, it can cause damaging condensation.\n\n2. It allows for better zone control. Individual zones can be turned on or off without significantly affecting the overall system pressure.\n\n3. It reduces the need for extra piping that would be required in a traditional header-type system with separate supply and return pipes.\n\n4. It provides more consistent heating across all radiators or heating elements, as each secondary loop receives water at the same temperature from the primary loop.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this configuration actually reduces the need for extra piping. Option C is incorrect because while it provides more consistent heating, it doesn't necessarily increase the overall temperature. Option D is incorrect as the main loop pipes (primary loop) are typically larger in diameter than the secondary loops."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/28", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/12867", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4707/"], "docs_id": 12867, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'd like to build a simple desk; just a single plank of wood (or a few side\\-by\\-side) with solid supports on each end of the desk.

Sorry if I posted to the wrong place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have to think David will agree, on reflection, that his answer has failed to capture the essence of entanglement. Any stream of particles, if not specially prepared, will measure \\+h/2 or \\-h/2 at detector A; they will do with respect to the x axis, or the y axis, or any axis. Exactly the same is true at detector B. How can this very ordinary circumstance illustrate the mystery of entanglement? But that seems to be what David has said: that if you prepare the particles in the entangled state, you get this \"strange result\". I see nothing strange about it since it seems to be exactly the same result if you set up two detectors far apart and measured streams of particles that were totally random.\n\nI am going to suggest that the mystery of entanglement lies in the perfect correlation (or anti\\-correlation) that you get when you set up both detectors along the x axis. Some people think there is nothing mysterious about this because it is exactly what you would expect if the two particles were created with equal and opposite spins. These people are very wrong. The reason they are wrong is that the experiment works the same no matter how you align the detectors with respect to the source of the particles. We can imagine an experiment where particles are created with opposite spins, but assuming the spin axis is random at the moment of creation, there is no way a pair of detectors should show 100% correlation no matter what angle you set it to. In fact, in the case of entanglement, there is 100% correlation regardless of the orientation. That is a real problem and it is really the only problem.\n\nEDIT: I explain this issue in more detail in my blog article, [\"Entanglement and the Crossed Polarizers\"](http://marty-green.blogspot.com/2011/12/entanglement-and-crossed-polarizers.html \"Entanglement and the Crossed Polarizers\")."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the key mystery of quantum entanglement according to the explanation provided?\n\nA) The fact that particles can be measured as +h/2 or -h/2 along any axis at detectors A and B\nB) The perfect correlation between entangled particles regardless of detector orientation\nC) The ability to prepare particles in an entangled state\nD) The creation of particles with equal and opposite spins\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe key mystery of quantum entanglement, as described in the text, is the perfect correlation (or anti-correlation) between entangled particles, regardless of how the detectors are oriented.

tested on my MacBook Pro 5\\.3:\n\n1. When you see \"Try Ubuntu without installing\", select it and type `e` for editing and add as kernel option `nomodeset`. You must insert it on the most long line who contains \"splash silent\", before the \"\\-\\-\". After that press `F10` key.\n2. Alternatively you can download and use [the special iso for Mac here](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/precise/daily-live/current/). Then choose \"64\\-bit Mac (AMD64\\) desktop CD.\" Everything works well without touching anything."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: You are trying to install Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro 5.3, but are encountering display issues during boot. Which of the following solutions is most likely to resolve the problem without requiring additional downloads?\n\nA) Download and use a special Mac-specific Ubuntu ISO image\nB) Add the kernel option \"nomodeset\" before booting from the standard Ubuntu ISO\nC) Install the r8169 network card driver after booting into Ubuntu\nD) Use the \"openipmish\" command to enable display redirection\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption A, while potentially effective, requires downloading an additional ISO image, which is not the most immediate solution.\n\nOption B is the correct answer as it provides a quick fix using the existing Ubuntu ISO. By adding \"nomodeset\" as a kernel option, it addresses common display issues on Mac hardware without requiring additional downloads.\n\nOption C relates to fixing network card issues, which is not relevant to the display problem described in the question.\n\nOption D refers to a command for managing IPMI interfaces, which is unrelated to resolving boot-time display issues on a Mac."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/13", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/482822", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/262948/"], "docs_id": 482822, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume that we have some count data $x\\_{1}, \\\\dots, x\\_{n}$, which take values $\\\\{1, \\\\dots, m\\\\}$\nand we have some estimator of the probability mass function, $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}} \\= (\\\\hat{p}\\_{1}, \\\\dots, \\\\hat{p}\\_{m})$. In order to evaluate the performance of the estimator one can use Brier score which is the following. Let $\\\\mathbf{I}\\_{i} \\= (0, \\\\dots, 1, \\\\dots, 0\\)$ is a vector in $\\\\mathbb{R}^{m}$, with value $1$ is at the $t$\\-th position from the beginning of the vector, if $x\\_{i} \\= t$, for $t \\\\in \\\\{1, \\\\dots, m\\\\}$ and all $i\\=1,\\\\dots, n$ . The Brier score is given by\n$$\nBS \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}\\|\\|\\\\mathbf{I}\\_{i} \\- \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\|\\|\\_{2}^{2} \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n} \\\\sum\\_{j\\=1}^{m}(I\\_{i,j} \\- \\\\hat{p}\\_{j})^2\\.\n$$\n\nI have got the following questions: what is the intuition behind this score? Will BS converge (in some sense) to the smallest value if (iff?) the estimator is consistent?\n\nIs this basically a quadratic score, suggested by Stone in\n\nM. Stone (1974\\) Cross\\-Validation and Multinomial Prediction Biometrika, Vol. 61, pp. 509\\-515 ?\n\nHow common is the use of it in practice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simplest way for me to think about the [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) is to think of it as the equivalent of mean\\-square error for this type of task. It is a particular [proper scoring rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule), with the property:\n\n> If a cost is levied in proportion to a proper scoring rule, the minimal expected cost corresponds to reporting the true set of probabilities.\n\nIt thus favors good calibration of the probability model, rather than properties like accuracy that are based on an assumed value of a particular probability cutoff to make assignments of categories.\n\nIn practice I suspect that log\\-loss is more frequently used as a proper scoring rule, because that's what underlies logistic regression. The Brier score is easily applied to evaluating any type of probability model, however, and you will find it frequently recommended here as a good way to discriminate among models. Today you would find [236 posts containing \"Brier score\"](https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22brier+score%22) on this site, close to the [246 containing \"log\\-loss\"](https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22log-loss%22)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The Brier score is a method for evaluating the performance of probability estimators.

I don't remember any massive Twitter thread about it. They're actually a lovely lot once you get to know them.\n\nNo one has ever complained about inclusiveness in Super User moderators or the fact we have no female ones.\n\nIn short? We're not big enough for people not really engaged in the network to complain about.\n\nWe don't need no Twitter whiners telling us we aren't friendly or inclusive. We don't curse the dark. We light fires. We fix the problems we see. We use our [site metas to educate folks](https://meta.superuser.com/questions/12972/can-we-be-nicer-to-folks-whose-english-isnt-that-great). We engage our fellow users. We flag. In short, we make the sites we use what we want it to be through direct, specific action.\n\nWhile sometimes folk deny it, *communities* form around Stack Exchange sites and as someone *inside* the system and *familiar* with these communities *you* can be part of the effort to make the communities friendlier.\n\nThe key is really *watching out for each other*. See something aimed to offend? Have a polite word, and or flag it.\n\nSee a user struggling with image uploads? Give a hand\n\nSee a post that has a good core, but quite a few spelling mistakes? Fix 'em.\n\nSee a question that has information scattered over comments? Roll 'em in. Add a comment like \"Comments are meant to be temporary \\- I've taken the liberty of rolling them into the question.\n\nI've had folks add *substantial* edits to my posts back in the day, and apologise for it. Those edits resulted in my question being better. \"Hi, the answer I wanted to post was very similar \\- so I've taken the liberty of adding additional information that hopefully improves it. If you're unhappy with it, you can choose to roll back\". Then upvote the answer so they don't.\n\nIn a sense we can make SE better *not* by worrying just about whether $group feels included. We make it better by trying to ensure users have a good experience, and we use *our* knowledge of the system to ease them through the first few posts.\n\nWe improve it by helping new users with the experience we have on the site. The best thing we can do for inclusiveness \\- for new users of *all* sorts is to help guide them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is the most effective way for users to improve inclusiveness and friendliness on Stack Exchange sites other than Stack Overflow?\n\nA) Waiting for official Stack Exchange initiatives to address issues on all sites\nB) Complaining about unfriendliness on Twitter to gain attention\nC) Taking direct, specific actions within the community to help and guide new users\nD) Focusing solely on increasing diversity among moderators\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer emphasizes that users can improve their Stack Exchange communities through \"direct, specific action\" rather than waiting for external interventions. It suggests actively helping new users, editing posts to improve quality, flagging inappropriate content, and generally being welcoming and supportive. The answer states, \"We fix the problems we see\" and \"We make the sites we use what we want it to be through direct, specific action.\" This approach of community members taking initiative is presented as more effective than complaining on social media or waiting for top-down changes."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/21", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173947", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/115661/"], "docs_id": 173947, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I will be installing a new 500GB hard drive in my macbook. It is a late 2008, aluminum, 13\\-inch screen. Once I install it, how do I get an operating system that's 10\\.7 or newer (downloaded from the App Store) on to the bare/unformatted drive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Being a 1 Mac household and an IT professional who has only supported PCs, I had a challenging time trying to figure out how to reload OSX after my husband's Mac hard drive died. Hopefully I diagnosed a bad hard drive correctly (I'll provide my method) and I hope this helps someone out there. This is probably overkill on instructions, but there are PC people out there who may try to help out the (much more) rare critical Mac issue. I did most of this from memory, so I may have messed up a label here or there. Please use Common sense if I did this and look around the screen for something that looks like what I'm talking about.\n\n**NOTE**: This process only worked because the hard drive was still able to access recovery mode by holding Command\\+R on startup. If your Mac is unable to access that feature, this may not work for you, but I included some other handy stuff, like recovering files from the drive.\n\nInitial Symptom: My husband's Mac had been randomly shutting down for some time, but we were limping it along. Finally, on startup one day, he saw a progress bar that would complete and then the device would shut down. Here is the process I followed:\n\n**Things you'll need:**\n\n* SATA/IDE to USB Adapter (Mine was Vantec USB 2\\.0, but it shouldn't matter. Be sure to get one with external power source. I've had little to no success with USB powered devices.\n* Mac running OSX Lion or later (prior versions didn't have the recovery partition)\n* New Hard drive that is compatible with Mac.\n* T8 Mini Torx screw driver\n* Small phillips screwdriver\n* *Recommend*: A cold beer and a lot of patience\n* Just in case you pull off the rubber coating, you'll need a case removal tool like you use to replace a cell phone screen. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVPDSG/ref\\=tsm\\_1\\_fb\\_lk](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B004XVPDSG)\n\nStep 1: Troubleshoot the Device\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Power off the Device\n2. Hold down the Command\\+R keys as you start the device. Continue holding the keys until the Recovery Utility prompts you to select a language (Grey Screen) \\*\\*NOTE:\\*\\*You may have to hold the keys for up to two minutes.\n3. After you've selected a language preference, Select the Disk Utility item in the list of utilities.\n4. Select your drive on the left navigation panel (It's probably already selected)\n5. Click the *Verify Disk* button in the Disk Utilities. It will probably show some erros. Click the *Repair Disk* button that will only appear after you click *Verify*. Do this until there are no errors or (like me) you receive a message saying that the disc couldn't be repaired.\n6. Click the *Verify Disk Permissions* button. If this completes successfully, click *Repair Disk Permissions*\n**NOTE** This may solve your problem. If you didn't receive a nasty message on step 5 saying the Disk was corrupt, to back up your files and such, good on ya! Try some Canadian troubleshooting \\-\\- When in doot (doubt) Reboot!\n\nStep 2: Removing the Hard Drive from the Mac\n--------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a great visual guide to the steps below: [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook\\+Pro\\+13\\-Inch\\+Unibody\\+Mid\\+2010\\+Hard\\+Drive\\+Replacement/4305](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2010+Hard+Drive+Replacement/4305)\n\n1. Turn off the MacBook.\n2. Remove the hard drive from the device by removing the 8 screws from the bottom of the MacBook and pulling off the bottom cover, **being careful not to pull at the edges as it will pull off the rubber coating**. If you accidentally do this, tip to follow. To pull the cover, put your fingers at the hinge of the MacBook screen (from the bottom), and lift from the metal part under the rubber cover.\n3. You will see a small black bar held down with two screws right next to the hard drive. This must be removed before the hard drive is pulled out.\n4. If your hard drive is OEM, there should be a plastic tab that you gently pull on to lift the hard drive, being cautious of the SATA cable\n5. Pull gently at the cable connector seated in the end of the hard drive facing the exterior of the case to disconnect the hard drive.\n\n### *If you messed up and pulled off the rubber coating:*\n\n1. After you have finished removing the bottom cover, get out the case removal tool from the list of things you'll need that you diligently ordered with your new hard drive for just $1 or so\n2. Hold the rubber coating on the metal case with the metal part (inside of the cover) facing you.\n3. **GENTLY** slip the edge of the case removal tool under the edges of the rubber coating with the edge of the tool facing towards you and lift the edge back over the edge of the metal backing.\n4. Slowly glide the tool around the edge, lifting the rubber back into place, being extra cautious around the corners.\n5. Put the back plate down and don't breathe on it or the rubber stuff will come off again.\n\nStep 3: Using a PC and HFS Explorer to Recover Files\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Download HFS Explorer and install it on your PC (<http://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/>)\n2. Plug the removed hard drive into the SATA/IDE to USB device. There will be two cables to plug in and they are directional. The smaller plug is the data cable that goes into the rectangular USB connector. The other goes to the power cable. If you bought the same one I did, there is a connector that adapts the standard power supply connector to SATA. There is a power switch on this cable.\n3. Plug the USB cable into your PC and turn on the power switch on the cable (if you haven't already).\n4. You should hear the device chime in Windows, or you can verify that the device driver was recognized and installed in Device Manager. **Note:** You will not see it show up as a hard drive as the Mac drive format is not diurectly compatible as a disk drive with Windows.\n5. Open HFS Explorer and click File \\> Load File System From Device\n6. I was not able to use the AutoDetect Button successfully, but you can try. I selected the *Select a Device* radio button and in the *Detected Devices* drop\\-down and click *Load*\n7. Select the files and folders you wish to back up in the tree to the left just like you would any Explorer (or Finder for you Mac peeps) tree, then click *Extract*. My husband's files were in the second partition under the **Users \\> \\[Username]** folder.\n8. Follow the prompts to extract the files to the desired location. You will have to babysit it because there are a lot of Mac file names that are not OK on Windows. I used the \"Auto\\-Rename\" feature and it worked swimmingly.\n\nStep 4: Installing OSX on the New Hard Drive\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're still with me, crack open another beer, because you've probably finished the first one. This was the most frustrating part to research. When you Google, \" How do I load OSX on a new hard drive using a PC \", you end up with some great suggestions to use VM Virtual Box, which means you have to get a copy of your OSX load. Well, mine happened to be on this one very broken Mac hard drive, and you can only make a Mac bootable with a Mac. Grr...So, I gave this a shot. I hope it works for you.\n\n1. Install the **NEW** hard drive back into Mac. Before you do this, there are a couple of screw\\-in pins that are in the sides of the old hard drive that you will need to hold your new hard drive in place. Use the T8 mini Torx screwdriver to remove them and place them into the sides of the new drive. These will hold your new drive in place. Put a couple of screws on opposite corners of the bottom plate to hold it in place and protect all the precious bits in there. **Do not turn on the Mac yet**\n2. Connect the **OLD** device to the SATA/IDE connector, connect the USB to the Mac and turn on the power to the new hard drive\n3. Hold down the *Option* key and turn on the device to choose which device to boot to.\n4. Select the **OLD** hard drive (Probably called Recovery\\_\\[something]) when prompted to choose a boot device.\n5. The boot sequence will take you into the Mac Recovery Utilities menu\n6. Select the Disk Utilities option from the menu\n7. Select the **NEW** Drive in the list to the left and click *Verify Disk*. This should come out clean\n8. Click the *Erase* option in the Disk Utility and complete a format of the hard drive using the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) option\n9. If you like, partition the drive using the *Partition* option and set the number and size of partitions to the desired size.\n10. Exit the Disk Utility tools using the menu in the upper\\-left\n11. In the recovery menu, click the Reinstall OSX option\n12. If you are prompted to connect to a wireless network, you can either connect it to an ethernet cable to speed things along, or click the Wireless icon in the upper\\-right of the top toolbar to search for an SSID to connect to. This will permit you to use the online recovery options to download the operating system.\n13. Follow the prompts and enter your iTunes login info\n14. When prompted to select a disk for installation, select the disk (or partition) you would like to install OSX on on the **NEW** hard drive and follow the prompts to initiate the installation.\n15. **IMPORTANT** When the reboot after download occurs, if the installation gets stuck on *Verifying Disks* or shows symptoms of pixelation on the progress bar and corresponding status text, hold down the power button on the Mac to shut it down. CONGRATULATIONS! You successfully diagnosed that the old hard drive is bad. ;\\-) If this occurs and your installation doesn't go through, pull the USB cable from the SATA/IDE to USB adapter from the USB port, hold down the *Control* key and turn the Mac on. Select the **Install OS X** drive as the boot device.\n16.

However, during the installation, the process gets stuck on \"Verifying Disks\" with a pixelated progress bar. What should be your next step to successfully complete the installation?\n\nA) Continue waiting, as the installation may take several hours to complete\nB) Restart the MacBook and try the installation process again from the beginning\nC) Shut down the MacBook, disconnect the external (old) hard drive, then reboot while holding the Control key and select the \"Install OS X\" drive\nD) Boot into Single User Mode and attempt to manually complete the installation using Terminal commands\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation specifically mentions that if the installation gets stuck on \"Verifying Disks\" or shows symptoms of pixelation on the progress bar, you should shut down the MacBook by holding the power button. Then, it instructs to disconnect the USB cable from the SATA/IDE to USB adapter (which connects the old hard drive), hold down the Control key while turning on the Mac, and select the \"Install OS X\" drive as the boot device.

I'm having a bit of trouble with my bridge overheating and I was wondering if smoothing the output would help. (Aside for putting a heat sink on it, which I'm in the process of doing) The bridge runs at 30A typically (rated for 100A) and starts getting hot kind of fast, but I only really use it for less than a minute anyway since the system I use it for is very efficient.\n\nEdit 0: The load is used for various electrochemical reactions done at low voltage (9V DC) and high current (30A DC). The reaction doesn't really care whether the DC is smoothed or not. The question refers to how much heat the bridge is building up, not that I'm running a heater.

The average and the RMS currents through the bridge will both increase, so more heat (but also more output power). \n\nBecause the capacitor charges in sharp pulses, the heating will actually be more than you might expect from the average output current increase.

This occurs for several reasons:\n\n1. The average current through the bridge increases, as the capacitor maintains a higher average voltage across the load.\n2. The RMS (Root Mean Square) current also increases, which directly relates to power dissipation.\n3. The capacitor charges in sharp pulses, leading to higher peak currents through the diodes.\n4. Diode forward voltage increases with current, causing more voltage drop and thus more power dissipation during these high-current pulses.\n5. Some of the heating is related to the square of the current (I\u00b2R losses), which becomes more significant with these sharp pulses.\n\nTherefore, while smoothing the output with a capacitor can improve the quality of the DC output, it actually increases the thermal stress on the bridge rectifier components."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/07/25", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/229788", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/119541/"], "docs_id": 229788, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is more of theoretical question, not a practical, but it might be useful for some (we already have a system).

The two differ in physical form factor, with PTHPs being lower to the ground/squatter than a unit marketed as TTW, but the concepts and operation are essentially the same for these units as they are for a window unit.\n\nPTHPs are commonly seen in multi\\-unit buildings, especially where units are small, such as hotel/motel rooms or efficiency apartments.

Run `sudo iwconfig` and turn off 'Power Management' for your card.\nReboot and see if it's fine now.\nReboot again and see if it's fine now. If not, we'd have to add it to the `Startup Applications`.\n2. A friend of mine faced the same issue. The default Atheros drivers were to be blamed. Your TX\\-log fills up and that leads to authentication failure.\n\nIn 'Software Sources'/'Software \\& Updates', enable 'Backports' under the 'Updates' tab.\n\nThen update the system.\n\nAlso:\n`sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic`\n\nReboot \\& check.\n3.

The access point works fine for several hours, but then stops accepting new connections. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue and its corresponding solution?\n\nA) The wireless card's power management is enabled, causing intermittent connectivity issues. Disable power management using \"iwconfig\" and add it to startup applications.\n\nB) The default Atheros drivers are causing the TX-log to fill up, leading to authentication failures. Enable backports and install updated drivers from the backports repository.\n\nC) The hostapd service is crashing periodically. Implement a cron job to restart the hostapd service every hour.\n\nD) The wireless channel is becoming congested over time. Configure hostapd to use dynamic channel selection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is related to the default Atheros drivers causing the TX-log to fill up, which leads to authentication failures after several hours of operation. This aligns with the symptoms described in the question, where the access point works fine initially but stops accepting new connections after some time.\n\nThe solution involves enabling backports in the Software Sources and installing updated drivers from the backports repository. Specifically, the answer suggests installing the package \"linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic\" which should provide updated drivers that address this issue.\n\nWhile option A (disabling power management) could potentially help with some wireless issues, it's less likely to be the root cause of the specific problem described. Options C and D are not mentioned in the provided troubleshooting steps and are less likely to address the core issue of authentication failures after extended operation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/14", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/114316", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/31180/"], "docs_id": 114316, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Being a young and fairly inexperienced developer recently employed by a \"real\" software company I'd like some opinions and pointers on how to do the following:\n\n**Approaches on how to get familiar with a companies products , especially when you've no idea how it all works**.

The insurance is mostly Life and Long Term Disability. We have a monolith library that all of our applications use at this time. We are thinking of moving more of our application to services and I'm trying to get some information on DDD practices to segment out our monolith.\n\nAs an example, two of our applications are a Policy Administration system and a Census Entry system. Policy Admin stores all the information about insurance policies and the clients. The client would be an organization, school, city, county, etc. Some pieces that are tracked are the policy header information, the classes, the different lines of business under the class (For a Life policy, you could have Supplemental Life, Spouse Life, Dependent Life, etc.), how volumes are calculated, rates, eligibility information, etc.\n\nA good representation of our current object model is the following. There are more pieces of information under each object but these are the main pieces.\n\n```\nClient\n  Policy\n    Class\n      Coverage (line of business)\n        Rates\n        Option (how volumes are calculated)\n        Eligibility (whether someone can elect the coverage)\n        Participation (rules on when to enforce requiring Evidence of Insurability)\n\n```\n\nOur census entry system handles the entry of employees at the client. It also uses the policy admin data to create coverage elections based on the policy, class, coverage and option an employee is electing. It uses the option to calculate and store the volume on the coverage election. \n\nData model in census entry would be\n\n```\nClient\n  Employee\n    Coverage Elections\n\n```\n\nIt seems I would have two bounded contexts here. One for Policy data and one for Employees and Coverage Elections.\n\n1. Would I have a copy of the necessary information from the policy admin system that the census entry system needs in order to perform? The concern here is there is a lot of data that would be needed. Most of our data has effective and cancel dates. For example, when an option changes; a new option is created and the old one is canceled. For a particular option there could be a few historical records that would be needed.\n2. Would I have a coordination service that the app talks to. This service handles getting the information from policy admin to do the actions in the census entry system? This introduces a dependency though.\n3. Some other way I'm not thinking of?\n\nI'm thinking that number 1 is the way to go but wanted to get some ideas. \n\nI have another situation where the census entry data and rates are used to generate a bill. For the billing system, would I have copies of the necessary data from both Policy Admin and Census Entry to perform that task?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am not the greatest master in these kinds of \"problems\". But the most flexible solution I can come up with is:\n\n* 1 table to hold the data for the groups\n* 1 table to hold data for the users\n* 1 table to assign users to groups, also specifying access level (regular, admin) and any other roles / rights might be needed.\n\nIn the \"worst\" case, the third table will have Ngroups x Nusers entries (all users are members in all groups)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of developing a Group Level Insurance system with Policy Administration and Census Entry components, which approach would best align with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for managing the relationship between these bounded contexts?\n\nA) Create a complete copy of all Policy Administration data within the Census Entry system, including historical records, to ensure full autonomy.\n\nB) Implement a coordination service that the Census Entry system calls to retrieve necessary information from Policy Administration in real-time.\n\nC) Maintain a selective copy of essential Policy Administration data within the Census Entry system, updated through event-driven mechanisms.\n\nD) Merge both Policy Administration and Census Entry data into a single, shared database to simplify data access.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C aligns best with DDD principles by maintaining bounded contexts while allowing for practical data sharing. It avoids the data duplication issues of A, the tight coupling of B, and the anti-pattern of a shared database in D. \n\nA selective copy of essential data, updated through events, allows the Census Entry system to operate independently while keeping relevant policy information synchronized. This approach respects bounded contexts, maintains data consistency, and allows for scalability and performance optimization.\n\nOption A would lead to excessive data duplication and synchronization challenges. Option B creates a direct runtime dependency between contexts, which can lead to performance issues and tight coupling.

That exact question is asked and answered in courses titled \"Computational Physics\" when they discuss Monte Carlo methods. Anyone interested in that question is vastly more likely to be a physicist than a statistician. Finally, the question received two very answers from physicists. The probabilities involved in the problem are not particularly difficult.\n\nTo clarify, I think it is a physics question because it is about a commonly\\-used physics tool. As a comparison, I use a differential refractometer in my research. A question about the internal functioning of a refractometer would clearly be on\\-topic. I see questions about the internal functioning of Monte Carlo methods to be on the same level: a question about how a particular physics tool works.

I usually make a point of checking the profile and am much more lenient with the young and wish that others would be too. Maybe newbies should be encouraged to give their age in the profiles and old hands encouraged to read the profile if they intent to jump on somebody or downvote with a strict comment.\n\nNow that you have brought this up I will mention that I am wondering why there are so few women physicists joining our questions and answers. I know that in some countries a large percentage of physicists are women. So this could be one of the reasons, since women take things more to heart, so to speak, even in this virtual reality. Of course there are other reasons too for the gender difference : children and grandchildren occupy women's extra curricular time very much.

The issue is likely caused by the mini-split units modulating their cooling output at low loads, which prevents the evaporator coils from getting cold enough to effectively condense moisture from the air. This leads to high humidity in the room and potential odor issues. The recommended solution, as mentioned in the top answer, is to switch the unit to \"dry\" mode, which forces the system to prioritize dehumidification. This addresses the root cause of the problem by ensuring proper moisture removal, even at low cooling loads.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation mentions that the evaporator coil doesn't look particularly dirty, and professional cleaning wasn't suggested as a solution.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this problem?\n\nA) Faulty hard drives on the server\nB) Incompatible GPU drivers on the workstations\nC) Incorrect DNS configuration on the network\nD) Permissions issues with networked home directories\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The problem described in the scenario is most likely caused by permissions issues with networked home directories. Several key points support this conclusion:\n\n1. The issue only occurs when using networked user accounts, not local accounts.\n2. The error logs show multiple \"access permission denied\" messages when trying to access the AddressBook database file in the user's networked home directory.\n3. The problem doesn't occur when the user is logged in directly on the server or when using local home folders.\n4. The issue persists across different server hardware and network configurations, suggesting it's related to how the system is accessing networked resources.\n\nWhile option B mentions GPU issues, which are discussed in the last part of the text, this is unrelated to the specific vCard and QuickLook problem described in the main scenario.

The user's processes inherit groups from the parent process or are given groups by the login process. To apply the new group membership, the user needs to either log out and log back in, use the 'newgrp' command to start a new shell with updated group memberships, or reboot the system. Option D correctly identifies this solution. \n\nOption A is incorrect because changing file permissions wouldn't address the underlying group membership issue.

The person probably had a leftover socket lying around and went \"whatever\". I myself had a NEMA 10\\-50 in my stocks; I threw it in the trash rather than risk someone installing it. \n\nYou cannot ever use NEMA 10 except to repair a broken outlet in dryer or range circuits which predate 1989\\. Anytime you see a grounded with neutral location with NEMA 10, it was installed NEMA 14 and foolishly rolled back to NEMA 10 socket because an appliance arrived with a NEMA 10 plug. The proper procedure is to change the plug to NEMA 14\\. \n\nYour all\\-metal EMT pipe has two \\#10 hot wires, a perfectly acceptable ground (The pipe itself) and a useless dunsel of a ground in the \\#12 green wire. Fortunately, redundant grounds are not illegal, so you can just ground it to the box and the panel and forget about it. Can't hurt, might help. \n\nYour wiring can support any of the following connectors: NEMA. 6\\-15, NEMA 6\\-20, and NEMA 6\\-30, however you must change the breaker to the corresponding amperage. (Due to a special exception a 20A breaker is allowed on a **dual** NEMA 6\\-15 socket; however it's illegal to put a 6\\-15 plug on a 16A charger.)\n\nYour charger, at 16A, is *right on the line* between needing a 20A plug or a 30A plug. Consult the instructions. Set your socket and breaker to match."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is assessing a NEMA 10-50 receptacle for potential use with an electric vehicle charging station (EVSE). The receptacle has a red wire, a black wire, and a green wire, and is connected to a 30-amp breaker. The wiring runs through 1/2 inch EMT conduit for about 25 feet. The EVSE draws 16 amps. What is the most appropriate and safe course of action?\n\nA) Use the existing NEMA 10-50 receptacle as-is for the EVSE\nB) Convert the receptacle to a NEMA 6-50, keeping the 30-amp breaker\nC) Replace the receptacle with a NEMA 6-30, change the breaker to 30 amps, and use the EMT conduit as the ground\nD) Replace the receptacle with a NEMA 6-20, change the breaker to 20 amps, and use the EMT conduit as the ground\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The existing NEMA 10-50 receptacle is incorrectly wired and unsafe to use. NEMA 10 configurations should only be used for pre-1989 dryer or range circuits. The proper action is to replace it. Given that the EVSE draws 16 amps, it requires a circuit rated for at least 20 amps (80% rule). The existing #10 wires can support up to 30 amps, but it's best to match the circuit to the EVSE's needs.

Simply put, you're not playing as team and the other team is. They're not necessarily bad players, but your team is scattered on the map and getting ganked.\n\nOther than pinging objectives and yelling at them for overextending, is there anything else that can be said or done to get your team to play as one?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer to this question could be very long and complicated as \"leading\" involves keeping track of a great many thing all of which are detailed in themselves. Lets start with the basics each of which can be expanded and may be scenario specific.\n\nFirstly, since you are asking the question we are going to assume YOU are going to be the team leader. As such, you need the following skills.\n\n* Diplomacy\n* Champion Knowledge\n\t+ Allied Champions\n\t+ Enemy Champions\n* Map Awareness\nSo Now lets break this down a little further\n\n---\n\n**Diplomacy**\n\nYou need to be able to guide your allies to accomplish whatever objective is in the best interest of the team and you need them to listen to you. Therefore, you should probably be talking and communicating with your team from the start of the game. If you start to bark out orders once everyone is level 9 or at the 20 minute mark, no one is going to listen to you because they will have developed their own strategy since none was presented to them. This being said, commanding and just pinging are insufficient to obtain the role of team leader. Some players will respond to \"mid needs help\" while others will need to be explicitly told and yet others won't ever listen to you at all (it happens). So you need to know the players on your team almost as well as the game itself to be an effective leader.\n\n---\n\n**Champion Knowledge \\- Allied Champions**\n\nYou have to know the capabilities of the champions you are leading ***.*** Note the emphasis on the preceeding \".\" You have to know each of your ally's strengths, weakness and limitations. Ideally you should be familiar with **all** of their abilities and those ability's strengths, weaknesses and limitations. There are too many champions and abilities to cover them and their interactions here but here is an example:\n\nLet's pretend your ally is Jax or Katarina and they are in trouble. Sometimes, you can save them by being in range of their Leap Strike/Shunpo abilities, allowing them to jump out of a gank. Leading is often more about being in the right place at the right time than telling other people where to be. If you are often at the right place at the right time (leading by example) players will recognize your competence and tend to congregate where you are, which is nice when starting a group push is your intention.\n\n**Champion Knowledge \\- Enemy Champions**\n\nKnowing your team is important but knowing the enemy team might just be more important. Knowing enemy champions, abilities and tendencies will allow you to make the correct decisions regarding: who and when to gank, when and where to push, watch to watch for when being baited, etc. Note there are guides to all of the above elsewhere so a detailed description of each will not be covered here. However, here is another example:\n\nYou are chasing an enemy at low health but there is a Teemo on the enemy team. Odds are the champion you are chasing will lead you on a trail through Teemo's mushrooms in hope that they will slow you enough that they get away or kill you if you are at low health. As the leader on your team it is your goal to remind your allies of this and minimize losses through overextension.\n\n---\n\n**Map Awareness**\n\nAll of the above is worth nothing if you aren't aware of what is going on in your game. What lanes are being pushed? What allies are in distress and in need of assistance? Where are enemy champions? Is the Dragon minion available to kill? Is the enemy team currently killing Baron?\n\nYou have to be playing your champion and simultaneously aware in some way of all of the above. Things like the Mini Map and communication are good tools to make sure you and your allies are aware of what is going on but there is also some degree of awareness that comes with experience.\n\n---\n\nThis answer was intended to focus more on the act of leading than to describing the specific situations and circumstances which may be encountered. In the end, every game situation is unique and will need a different approach. It should also be noted that mastering the game mechanics and becoming a good individual player is not the same as being a good leader. Communication and team play are imperative when seeking wins and an improved gaming experience overall."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a team leader in a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, which combination of skills is most crucial for effectively guiding your team to victory in the late game?\n\nA) Strong individual mechanics, ability to solo carry, and extensive knowledge of your own champion\nB) Diplomacy, allied and enemy champion knowledge, and map awareness\nC) Ability to ping objectives frequently, yell at teammates for mistakes, and farm efficiently\nD) Knowledge of meta strategies, perfect last-hitting, and aggressive playstyle\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Diplomacy, allied and enemy champion knowledge, and map awareness. \n\nThis combination of skills is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as essential for an effective team leader. Diplomacy is crucial for communicating with teammates and getting them to follow your lead.

Is this an actual item of clothing, or is it some sort of future piece of fashion that we're supposed to imagine? As you can see, there's not much context to go on in figuring out what it might look like.\n\nThere was some suggestion [on SciFi Stackexchange](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/71304/what-is-a-terrorist-jacket) (from which this was migrated) that this may be a fanciful prediction for how language may evolve in the future, and that the author is suggesting that the distinction between \"bomber\" and \"terrorist\" may disappear in future British English. My question is: **is this an actual type of clothing, or was it made up for the book?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A Google Books search finds three books with one or more matches for \"terrorist jacket\" besides Connie Willis, [*The Doomsday Book*](https://books.google.com/books?id=2v22ikL95GQC&pg=PA70&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw5Pj9uOPQAhVI2WMKHYi4CH0Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (1993\\). One book is older than Willis's and two are younger.\n\nThe early occurrence is from Meade Minnigerode, [*The Magnificent Comedy: Some Aspects of Public and Private Life in Paris, from the Fall of Robespierre to the Coming of Bonaparte, July, 1794\\-November, 1799*](https://books.google.com/books?id=OPpnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22terrorist+jacket%22&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw5Pj9uOPQAhVI2WMKHYi4CH0Q6AEIVDAI) (1931\\) \\[combined snippets]:\n\n> When the time came to strike down H\u00e9bert, and Chaumette\u2014when it was necessary to be clear of any indulgent taint, when policy required a display of terrorist zeal, lest it be said that the attack on H\u00e9bert was counter\\-revolutionary in character\u2014Robespierre made himself the patron of the blood drinkers; he slipped on his **terrorist jacket** and was as comfortable in it as he had ever been in his immaculate blue coat. Later, when policy required, he would perhaps slip it off again. He spilled blood, Thibaudeau was to record, \"solely as a deliberate necessity in order to ... surmount obstacles. ... The scaffold was the only weapon that he knew how to handle; he made use of it without pity and without remorse.\"\n\nIn this excerpt, the author might just as well have spoken of Robespierre's \"terrorist hat\": the sense is purely metaphorical and the word *jacket* (or *hat*) stands for *role*\u2014the particular role that the man is to play when appropriately garbed (metaphorically speaking).\n\nNext, from Joseph Black, [*Vladimir Putin and the New World Order: Looking East, Looking West?*](https://books.google.com/books?id=V6EidjCuDKIC&pg=PA343&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRhLqzu-PQAhVHHGMKHVBQCqsQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (2004\\):\n\n> As we have seen, officials in Moscow looked forward to the upcoming APEC meetings in Shanghai, where they hoped to hear what they had gained by closing the \\[Lourdes surveillance] base in which there had been some 1,000 personnel housed. Confusion on this issue was common on Moscow, where misguided rumors circulated that it was not to be fully closed down. Certainly the Russian communist press kept pressure on the Kremlin and the public to maintain links with Cuba and, above all, to prevent the U.S. from fitting Cuban for a **terrorist jacket**, making it subject to attack by the coalition.\n\nIn this excerpt *Cuban* appears to be a typo for *Cuba*, and the sense of the sentence is that the U.S. government is eager to act (metaphorically) the role of tailor and impose the identity of \"terrorist\" on the Cuban government. The jacket in question may also carry a hint of being a straitjacket. The sense of the expression here is quite similar to its sense in the previous example.\n\nAnd from Susan Rosenberg, [*An American Radical*](https://books.google.com/books?id=ovUeQCkmoE8C&pg=PT126&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7w_y8xOPQAhXGxVQKHdsVBRoQ6AEITjAH#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (2011\\):\n\n> They interviewed all of us. We had thirty minutes each. I went first,and when I was finished I hoped that everyone else had been more detailed in their descriptions, as I didn't think I had been clear enough. The ACLU \\[American Civil Liberties Union] team had been sympathetic, but the problem of my \u201c**terrorist jacket**\u201d seemed to be a big concern. They asked me question after question about my record. Dr. Korn said that it was clear to him that the unit had a specific intent.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The BOP \\[Bureau of Prisons] had admitted to the ACLU that while we had been housed in the HSU \\[High Security Unit], there had been no threats by outside forces to either retaliate against the BOP or to free us and that our placement there was simply a matter of the \"justice community's\" decision. We believed that if we relied in the BOP's answer, we would never get rid of the \"**terrorist jacket**.\" They would construct a larger version of what we were in, with all the necessary controls in it. We further believed that our psychological files needed to be released to prove that the HSU was an experiment in psychological torture.\n\nIn Rosenberg's book, *jacket* has a very specific meaning:\n\n> A \"**prison jacket**\" is security identification that determines your resulting placement in either a maximum\\- or minimum\\-security facility. It is based on the moment of the crime. Because the crime and its severity are frozen in time, this ensures that the prisoner is her crime. Because you cannot undo the events that have occurred, you are reduced to the greatest mistake of your life, or the most extreme behavior of your life.\n\nEssentially, Rosenberg had been assigned a prison jacket of \"terrorist\"\u2014that is, the federal prison system had labeled her, for administrative purposes, a terrorist; she compresses that idea into the expression \"terrorist jacket.\"\n\nIf we turn now to the examples from Willis's book, we immediately see that \"terrorist jacket\" as used there is neither a metaphor nor a specimen of bureaucratic jargon. It's simply descriptive: Montoya is wearing a jacket that the author thinks looks like the kind of jacket a terrorist might wear. The absence of any other instance of \"terrorist jacket\" in the Google Books database strongly suggests that this term is strictly Willis's invention, and that you could go to an Abercrombie \\& Fitch or Burberry or FCUK store anywhere and not find a rack of outer garments for sale beneath a placard with the alluring name \"terrorist jackets.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Connie Willis' novel \"Doomsday Book\", the term \"terrorist jacket\" is used to describe a piece of clothing worn by a character.

For any $x\\\\in X$, the set\n$$P\\_x\\=\\\\{a\\\\in H:x\\\\in g(a)\\\\}$$\nis a filter closed under arbitrary meets, i.e., principal: $P\\_x\\=\\[h(x),1]$ for some $h(x)\\\\in H$. Moreover, $P\\_x$ is completely prime, hence the element $h(x)$ is completely join\\-irreducible.\n\nNow, if $a,b\\\\in H$ are such that $a\\\\nleq b$, then there exists a completely join\\-irreducible element such that $u\\\\le a$, and $u\\\\nleq b$: indeed, $g(a)\\\\nsubseteq g(b)$ as $g$ is an embedding, hence there is $x\\\\in g(a)\\\\smallsetminus g(b)$, and then $u\\=h(x)$ works.\n\nThis implies that any $a\\\\in H$ is the join of all completely join\\-irreducible elements below it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let H be a complete Heyting algebra.

According to the proposition in the documentation, a complete Heyting algebra H has a complete embedding into Up(X) for some poset X if and only if every element of H is a join of a set of completely join-irreducible elements in H. This is equivalent to H being isomorphic to Up(X) for some poset X.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all complete Heyting algebras have such embeddings (e.g., the real interval [0,1]).\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete.

What is the largest k so that at least 95% of the boxes meet the warranty?\n\nAttempt:\nI know I should use the Central Limit Theorem for this problem, but not sure what N should be in the setup since there are 400 devices in each box and the number of boxes are unknown. Could anyone give me a hint on the setup? Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **You have to assume the devices in any box are independent.** When that is the case, the number of working devices in any box must follow a Binomial distribution. The parameters are $400$ (the number of devices in the box) and $.95$ (the working rate).\n\nSuppose you guarantee $k$ or more devices per box work. You are saying that at least 95% of all such boxes contain $k$ or more working devices. In the language of random variables and distributions, you are asserting that the chance of a Binomial$(400, 0\\.95\\)$ variable equaling or exceeding $k$ is at least $95\\\\%$. The solution is found by computing the $100\\-95$ \\= fifth percentile of this distribution. The only delicate part is that since this is a discrete distribution, we should take some care not to be one off in our answer.\n\n`R` tells us the fifth percentile is $k\\=373$:\n\n```\nqbinom(.05, 400, .95)\n\n```\n\n> 373\n\nLet's check by computing the chance of equaling or exceeding this value:\n\n```\npbinom(373-1, 400, .95, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n```\n\n> 0\\.9520076\n\n(Somewhat counter\\-intuitively, for me at least, is that the `lower.tail=FALSE` argument of `R`'s `pbinom` function does *not* include the value of its argument. Thus, `pbinom(k,n,p,lower.tail=FALSE)` computes the chance associated with an outcome *strictly* greater than `k`.)\n\nAs a double\\-check, let's confirm that we cannot guarantee even a larger value: \n\n```\npbinom(373, 400, .95, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n```\n\n> 0\\.9273511\n\nThus, the threshold of $0\\.95$ falls between these two successive probabilities.\n\nIn other words, we have found that\n\n> In the long run $95\\.2\\\\%$ of the boxes will contain $k\\=373$ or more working devices, but only $92\\.7\\\\%$ of them will contain $374$ or more working devices. Therefore we should not guarantee any more than $373$ if we want $95\\\\%$ or more of the boxes to meet this standard.\n\nIncidentally, a Normal distribution *turns out* to be an excellent approximation for this particular question. (Rather than display the answer you would get, I will leave it to you to do the calculation, since you requested information only on how to set up the problem.)\n\nThis plot compares the Binomial distribution function to its approximating Normal probability.\n\n[![figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iotJf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iotJf.png)\n\nThe two don't perfectly agree\\-\\-*but near $k\\=373$ they are very close indeed.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electronics company produces devices that work properly 95% of the time.

What is the largest value of k that satisfies this condition?\n\nA) 371\nB) 372\nC) 373\nD) 374\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C (373). This problem can be solved using the Binomial distribution with parameters n=400 (number of devices per box) and p=0.95 (probability of a device working).\n\nTo find k, we need to calculate the 5th percentile of this distribution, as we want 95% of boxes to meet or exceed this number. Using statistical software or tables, we can determine that the 5th percentile of a Binomial(400, 0.95) distribution is 373.\n\nWe can verify this by calculating:\nP(X \u2265 373) \u2248 0.9520 (95.20%)\nP(X \u2265 374) \u2248 0.9274 (92.74%)\n\nThis shows that 373 is the largest value of k that ensures at least 95% of boxes will meet the warranty conditions.\n\nOption A (371) and B (372) are too low and would result in more than 95% of boxes meeting the condition, which is not the largest possible k.\nOption D (374) is too high, as only about 92.74% of boxes would meet this condition, falling short of the required 95%."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/18", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/691227", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/514900/"], "docs_id": 691227, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to append file text after last word of another file on a UNIX system.\n\nFile 1\n\n```\n& program executed successfully\n\n```\n\nFile 2\n\n```\nHello\nWorld\nThis is a sample output \n\n```\n\nI want to copy the first two words and paste them after the last word of file 2\\.\n\nExpected output:\n\nFile3\n\n```\nHello\nWorld\nThis is a sample output & program\n\n```\n\nFile2 has a newline character at the end, so when I tried using `cat`, it prints on a new line instead of printing after the last word on the same line.

(Or \"What's not \\[adjective] about \\[something].\") Also note, though, that in this construction the speaker is usually making the opposite point; ie. they think the privacy policy is perfectly clear, and don't understand what you could possibly see as unclear.\n\nSome other situations where you could use this construction:\n\n> Person 1: I thought you said this party was going to be fun?\n> \n> \n> Person 2: Oh, come on. What's not fun about this party?\n\nOr:\n\n> Person 1: You look great in that Big Bird costume!\n> \n> \n> Person 2: Seriously? What about this costume is not ridiculous?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the usage and implication of the phrase \"What about [something] is not [adjective]?\" in English?\n\nA) It's only used to express genuine curiosity about unclear aspects of a topic.\nB) It's primarily used to challenge negative perceptions and emphasize positive qualities.\nC) It's a grammatically incorrect construction and should be avoided in formal communication.\nD) It's exclusively used in academic discussions to analyze complex subjects.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"What about [something] is not [adjective]?\" is primarily used to challenge negative perceptions and emphasize positive qualities. As explained in the StackExchange answer, this construction is often employed when the speaker believes the opposite of what's being implied. For instance, in the example \"What's not fun about this party?\", the speaker is suggesting that the party is indeed fun, contrary to someone else's implication. \n\nWhile option A captures part of the usage, it misses the key aspect of the phrase often being used rhetorically. Option C is incorrect as the construction is grammatically valid and widely used. Option D is too narrow and doesn't reflect the phrase's common usage in everyday conversations.\n\nThe correct answer, B, best captures the essence of how this phrase is typically used - as a rhetorical device to challenge a negative view and implicitly assert a positive one."}}
