The following plot is one example.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/47lAp.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/47lAp.png)\n\nHere are some questions:\n\n* Why don't we include the area below 0\\-10kHz as well? And also why does integration stop at 2fo?\n* There's a formula that relates the bandwidth to the IPN power, given as \\\\$ P\\_{noise}\\=S\\_1\\+10log(4BW\\_1\\) \\\\$, where \\\\$S\\_1\\\\$, which has the unit dBc/Hz, and \\\\$BW\\_1\\\\$ are specified in the following figure,\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H149B.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H149B.png)\n\nThe document given to me only cited this equation from a conference journal held at an ISSCC public meeting somewhere in 2009\\. Couldn't find its source unfortunately. Anyway I can relate the RMS phase jitter to the noise power given by the document as such:\n\n$$ \\\\sqrt{4S\\_1BW\\_1}$$\n\n$$\\\\sqrt{10^{\\\\frac{S\\_1}{10}}.10^{log(4BW\\_1\\)}}$$\n\n$$\\\\sqrt{10^{\\\\frac{S\\_1\\+10log(4BW\\_1\\)}{10}}}$$\n\n$$\\\\sqrt{10^{\\\\frac{P\\_{noise}}{10}}}$$\n\n* How does this equation reconcile with the equation given in the first image, in which RMS phase error is reported on as \\\\$\\\\sqrt{2\\\\times 10^{\\\\frac{A}{10}}}\\\\$. There seems to be a 2 missing in the document's calculated noise power. So does it really miss a 2?\n* Since \\\\$S\\_1\\\\$ is measured at f\\-3dB it looks to me that some area will be missed from integration. Because \\\\$S\\_1\\\\$ is slightly less than the dc gain of the noise profile. Does that add to the inaccuracy of the second formula for RMS phase jitter?\n\nThanks for your attention,\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's unclear from the image if you have set the FTDI adapter to the correct voltage 5\\.0V or 3\\.3V (it should be 3\\.3V).\n\nI have experience programming bare ESP32 modules in this manner, but never a break\\-out board like this.\n\nLooking at your log and reading through esptool.py is seems clear that you have communication in both directions, otherwise it should have failed earlier \\- BUT I would verify this by disconnecting one wire (TX, RX) at a time and try a download, just make sure that the download behavior does indeed change.\n\nHow are you powering the ESP32? It looks like you are taking VCC from the FTDI adapter. The ESP32 is a bit power hungrier than many other controllers, are you sure your FTDI adapter is able to power it adequately?\n\nRemoving the USB/TTL bridge *should* not be necessary as it *should* be passive with no USB connected, and most ESP32 breakout boards include a resistor on the bridge TX output to make sure you can \"override\" the signal externally, like you are doing now. However, if you keep being unable to program I would remove it or cut the relevant traces just to be sure."}, "answer": "Question: An engineer is attempting to program an ESP32 breakout board using an FTDI adapter but is encountering difficulties.

The answer states that \"The ESP32 is a bit power hungrier than many other controllers, are you sure your FTDI adapter is able to power it adequately?\" This suggests that insufficient power could be the root cause of the problem.\n\nOption A is less likely because while the voltage setting is mentioned, it's not identified as the primary issue. Option B is incorrect because the answer indicates there is communication in both directions. Option D is possible but considered a last resort, as the answer suggests removing the USB/TTL bridge only if other solutions fail."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/06/29", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/72798491", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/17900785/"], "docs_id": 72798491, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a microservice that will receive a message, something like this:\n\n```\n[\"00:12\", \"12:20\", \"15:40\"]\n\n```\n\nAre there any out\\-of\\-the\\-box solutions to allow methods to run at a given time each day?\nUsing cron from Spring does not involve changing the time at runtime.

The error logs show repeated \"Allowed memory size exhausted\" errors. What is the most likely cause and immediate solution to this problem based on the information provided?\n\nA) The upgrade to PHP 7.3 is incompatible with Magento 2.4, causing memory leaks. Downgrade to PHP 7.2.\nB) Elasticsearch 6.7 is not properly configured, leading to excessive memory usage. Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.x.\nC) The Content Security Policy (CSP) module is malfunctioning, causing uncontrolled memory consumption. Temporarily disable the CSP module.\nD) The server lacks sufficient RAM for Magento 2.4's requirements. Increase the server's physical memory.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key to solving this issue lies in analyzing the error log patterns. The top answer points out that the errors consistently follow a specific sequence: Serialize error, collector error, and CSP error. Upon investigating the CSP module, it was found that the unserialize, dynamicCollector->add, and dynamic policy addition functions were triggering these errors.\n\nThe answerer successfully resolved the issue by disabling the CSP module, which immediately improved performance. While other factors like PHP version, Elasticsearch configuration, or server resources could potentially contribute to performance issues, the specific error pattern and the immediate resolution achieved by disabling the CSP module strongly indicate that this is the root cause of the problem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because PHP 7.3 is compatible with Magento 2.4, and downgrading PHP is unlikely to resolve this specific issue. Option B is incorrect because while Elasticsearch configuration could affect performance, it doesn't explain the specific error pattern observed. Option D, while potentially beneficial in some cases, doesn't address the root cause identified in the error logs and the successful resolution by disabling the CSP module."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/09/15", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/256716", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/156635/"], "docs_id": 256716, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was in my kitchen and decided to take something to the patio. I flipped the light switch, which is a dimmer. Once I did that, all the lights in the surrounding area went out. Not the entire house. We went out to the breaker box and nothing was tripped. My husband then flipped the breaker switch that is responsible for these areas and the lights came back on. To test, I duplicated the scenario and the same thing happened. Not sure what to do or what\u2019s wrong.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Two key clues:\n\n* *to the patio* That means \"outside\". Outside often means vulnerable to weather. Has it rained recently? Even if it has not, but certainly if it has, you could have water in a light fixture or a junction box between the switch and the lights. That can cause an actual short or a *ground fault*.\n* *nothing was tripped* There are two kinds of breaker trips: *overcurrent* and *AFCI/GFCI*.\n\nOvercurrent is what we are all used to: A 20A circuit gets 50A (or even more in a \"dead short\") and quickly trips. Breakers are now designed to \"trip\" (stop current flow) even if the breaker handle is physically held in place. As a side effect, it is possible for an overcurrent trip to happen without any *visible* movement in the breaker panel.\n\nAFCI/GFCI is actually two different things, but they have a key in common: if they are protected by a breaker you do *not* necessarily get the usual \"trip\" that you get in an overcurrent situation. Current is still cut off, but through a different mechanism. GFCI is the one most people are familiar with, known by the TEST and REST buttons on receptacles in kitchens and bathrooms. But GFCI (and its cousin AFCI) can be on breakers instead of at point of use.\n\nIn all of these cases, turning the breaker \"off\" (though it was actually already \"off\") and \"on\" will fix the problem, at least until the next trigger event. But if it is an AFCI or GFCI trip then you may (depending on the breaker design) be able to press a RESET button on the breaker.\n\nOutside *receptacles* are required to have GFCI protection. Outside *lights* are generally not required to have GFCI protection. But they often do have GFCI protection, either because they share a circuit with outside receptacles or just because somebody decided it made sense.\n\nMy hunch is that your trip was due to rain or condensation in an outside light fixture or junction box, either GFCI or an actual overcurrent trip.\n\nTake a look at your breaker. If it has a RESET button on it, or any writing about AFCI or GFCI or \"Testing\" or an indicator light, read carefully and figure out how to:\n\n* Determine if a trip is AFCI, GFCI or overcurrent (it may be easy to figure out or it may not)\n* Reset it from an AFCI or GFCI trip that did not involve an overcurrent trip. An overcurrent trip always requires actual breaker movement to reset, but AFCI and GFCI often do not.\n\nThen see if you can reproduce the problem and check the breaker to see if it either indicates an AFCI or GFCI trip or responds to a RESET button.\n\nIf this turns out to be a GFCI trip then the usual solution is to track down which location (should be something controlled by the dimmer) is causing the problem, dry it out and see if that fixes the problem. Not all GFCI trips can be solved by drying things out \\- sometimes there is insulation damage or component damage requiring replacing things to properly fix it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner experiences a power outage in part of their house when using a dimmer switch for patio lights.

Key points supporting this:\n\n1. The issue involves outdoor lighting (patio), which is prone to moisture exposure.\n2. No visible breaker trip was observed, which is characteristic of GFCI trips.\n3. Cycling the breaker restored power, which can reset a GFCI trip.\n4. The problem is reproducible, suggesting an environmental factor like moisture.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a faulty dimmer alone wouldn't typically cause a partial outage affecting multiple areas. Option B is wrong because the question specifically states no visible trip was observed. Option D is an overreaction; rewiring the entire area is unnecessary based on the symptoms described.

However, note the use of `-e` (gnome\\-terminal doesn't match xterm's behavior). If you are using Debian/Ubuntu/etc, the Debian packagers have attempted to provide a wrapper to hide this difference in the `x-terminal-emulator` feature.

Calculations show that when a shock wave\n>  encounters an interstellar cloud, it races around the thinner exterior\n>  of the cloud more rapidly than it can penetrate its thicker interior.\n>  Thus, shock waves do not blast a cloud from only one direction. They\n>  effectively squeeze it from many directions.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. If the Sun (and Solar System) was formed in this way, rather than a collapse of a cloud of dust and gas, (by itself, through gravity alone), do we have any idea of what event caused it, for example, do we know where a possible ex\\-supernovae is located, or has it long since vanished by now?\n2. Stars are often formed in groups. I wonder do we have an age for the nearest stars (using the [H\\-R diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram)) or any evidence that they may have been part of the same gas and dust cloud that formed our Sun?\n\nI do appreciate that:\n\n1. Astronomical observations are difficult in many circumstances, e.g. obscuration by dust or gas often prevents an accurate picture of objects located many light years from Earth.\n2. The Sun was formed 4,500 million years ago, this fact may make finding evidence of a possible trigger event extremely difficult to discover.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're right that the Sun being 4\\.5 billion years old makes observations difficult. The Sun goes around the Galaxy about once every 225 million years, so since the Sun formed it has gone around the Galaxy perhaps 20 times. The trouble is that the Galaxy is not like the Solar System: stars don't go around on nice nearly circular orbits, everything is a bit jumbled. To give you an idea, here's an estimate of where the stars that are currently in the Solar neighbourhood have been during the [last orbit of the Sun around the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year):\n\n![animation of some MW stellar orbits for stars now near the Sun](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8jrc.gif)\n\nAs you can see, they span over 80,000 light years (that's basically the full width of the Milky Way) just 1 orbit ago, so a supernova remnant that was near the Sun 20 orbits ago could be virtually anywhere. We can't measure the age of the Sun or supernova remnants accurately enough to help either (as in being able to say \"aha! a remnant with exactly the age of the Sun!\").\n\nIt's similarly difficult to find stars that may have formed near the Sun. About the best we can do is to look for stars with similar age and chemical composition to the Sun, but at 4\\.5 billion years old, the accuracy of stellar ages isn't terribly good. Asking more broadly what star formation conditions were like in the Milky Way when the Sun formed is also a difficult question and a topic of current research, see for instance [this reasonably current review](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:0907.0415).\n\nA potentially more fruitful approach is to look for Sun\\-like stars that are forming now and see what conditions look like for their formation \\- potential triggering mechanisms, how many stars formed in a group, etc. But this only helps inform what the formation of the Sun would have looked like \\- it's likely the Milky Way was a significantly different beast 4\\.5 billion years ago in terms of gas supply, morphology, [ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Interstellar_medium) conditions, etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information about stellar formation and the Sun's history, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) We can easily trace the Sun's origin to a specific supernova remnant that triggered its formation 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nB) Stars currently near the Sun likely formed from the same gas cloud, as evidenced by their similar ages on the H-R diagram.\n\nC) The Sun has orbited the Milky Way galaxy approximately 20 times since its formation, making it difficult to pinpoint its exact origin location.\n\nD) The conditions of star formation in the Milky Way 4.5 billion years ago were likely identical to what we observe in Sun-like star formation today.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer C is correct because the information states that the Sun goes around the Galaxy about once every 225 million years, and since it's 4.5 billion years old, it has completed roughly 20 orbits. This, combined with the complex and \"jumbled\" nature of galactic orbits, makes it extremely difficult to determine the Sun's exact origin location. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the text explicitly states that finding evidence of a trigger event from 4.5 billion years ago is extremely difficult. \n\nOption B is not supported by the information given, which suggests that accurate age determination for stars as old as the Sun is challenging.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the text mentions that the Milky Way was likely significantly different 4.5 billion years ago in terms of gas supply, morphology, and interstellar medium conditions compared to what we observe today."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/12/10", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/268215", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/125207/"], "docs_id": 268215, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: ***Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, and your wisdom.***\n\nCan I say this in formal speech to an old guy who have taken good care of me and taught me a lot?\n\nIs \"wisdom\" natural to use or is it overly formal.

Simply laying it on the ground, even with some type of warning tape is not going to change that.\n\nThe line needs to be buried but before doing that you need to determine if the wire used is rated for direct burial. If should have a \"UF\" designation on it. UF wire is more expensive than non\\-UF types and that's what concerns me regarding your \"electrician\". He cut corners on the installation, he may have cut corners on the materials as well.\n\nAlso, this type of circuit (i.e. outdoor) needs to have a GFCI breaker installed. Where did the hookup to existing power happen?

This ensures the installation is safe and up to code before any further work is done.

They have mostly to do with the internal workings of the class and are not required to be public or internal.\n\nExample:\n\n```\npublic class MyButton : Button, ICoolFoo\n{\n    private void InitializeFoo()\n    {\n        // Only used from class\n    }\n\n    private void UpdateFoo()\n    {\n        // Only used from class\n    }\n\n    public Foo SomeFoo()\n    {\n        // From ICoolFoo.\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MyLabel : Label, ICoolFoo\n{\n    private void InitializeFoo()\n    {\n        // Only used from class\n    }\n\n    private void UpdateFoo()\n    {\n        // Only used from class\n    }\n\n    public Foo SomeFoo()\n    {\n        // From ICoolFoo.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe initialize and update methods are only used from inside the class and don't require access from outside. The consumer of these classes doesn't care about them so putting them in an interface would bloat it unnecessarily.\n\nNow, from a developer's perspective I need to document that implementers of ICoolFoo should have a similar structure to keep the details similar and easy to follow, but are irrelevant to the outside. Ideally I would add something like a base class with private virtual members which I can add to any new class with a few keystrokes, but that doesn't work of course.\n\nIs there any pattern or clever architecture to improve this design?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This depends a lot on the ecosystem, specifically:\n\n* Do library developers take backwards\\-compatibility seriously?\n* Can I install different versions of the same package side by side?\n\nIf the answer to either question is \u201cyes\u201d, there is no problem.\n\nWhen backwards\\-compatibility is ensured, there is no conflict between the dependency on E v1\\.X and E v2\\.X. As E v2\\.X is backwards compatible to E v1\\.X, you can resolve the dependency to E v2\\.X and everything should work. This means that packages should not specify exact dependency versions or ranges of allowed versions, but only minimum required versions. This strategy is sufficient in stable, well\\-tested ecosystems like Debian/APT or CPAN.\n\nWhen I can install and load multiple versions of the same package, two different versions do not conflict. The advantage is that all dependencies are isolated, and that precise versions can be pinned. The disadvantage is that dependencies cannot be shared between libraries which leads to duplication and bloat. Languages that assume a global package namespace generally have difficulty with this strategy. This strategy can also cope with unstable ecosystems where breaking changes are common (e.g. Ruby or JavaScript). Notable users of this strategy are NPM and Java/OSGi.\n\nSo what happens if there are breaking changes, but I can't install two versions for the same package?\n\nThe naming scheme you have suggested is not uncommon. Assuming that each project uses a SemVer\\-compatible version number like \u201cFoo v1\\.X.0\u201d and \u201cFoo v2\\.Y.0\u201d, the major version number that indicates breaking changes would become part of the package name, leading to packages like `foo X.0` and `foo2 Y.0`. (If the major version is `1` that is essentially meaningless for the purpose of a package name, so it can be omitted.) Within each of `foo` and `foo2` there would only be backwards\\-compatible changes, so the minimum\\-version strategy can be used.\n\nIn the Ubuntu repositories, there are multiple APT packages with such names, for example `python` vs. `python3`, or `openjdk-8` vs. `openjdk-9`, or `libgtk2.0-0` vs. `libgtk-3-0`. Most projects do not see changes on a scale that would make versioned package names necessary."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a software ecosystem where breaking changes are common and multiple versions of the same package cannot be installed side by side, which of the following strategies is most effective for managing dependencies with conflicting version requirements?\n\nA) Always use the latest version of each dependency, regardless of compatibility\nB) Implement a naming scheme that incorporates the major version number into the package name\nC) Strictly enforce backwards compatibility for all package updates\nD) Use exact version numbers for all dependencies in project specifications\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This approach would likely lead to frequent compatibility issues and is not recommended.\nB) This is the correct answer.

When you communicate between 6to4 and Teredo you get all the problems of each combined plus a few more due to complex interactions between the protocols.\n\nThus it may come as a surprise to you that the answer is: **Yes, you can get reliable communication between 6to4 and Teredo.**\n\nBoth protocols suffer from the same main problem. They rely on third party relays which are underprovisioned and due to their third party nature come with no SLA.\n\nTeredo uses one relay for both directions. 6to4 usually uses two for different directions, but due to the triangular routing in Teredo you end up depending on three 6to4 relays rather than just two. That is a total of four third party relays which you will be depending on \\- all of which must have enough capacity for your traffic.\n\nBut you don't have to rely on third party relays. You can set up your own relay.\n\nSetting up your own Teredo relay\n================================\n\nThe Teredo relay is the simplest to set up, and it happens to be the most important to your scenario. A Teredo relay needs a single UDP port on a public IPv4 address. Thus you should not deploy the relay on the LAN behind your D\\-Link router. You should avoid having any 6to4 relay/gateway on the path between your LAN and the Teredo relay. Thus you should not deploy the relay outside the D\\-Link router.\n\nIn short you need a Teredo relay on the D\\-Link router to make connectivity work reliably. If the D\\-Link cannot run a Teredo relay, your best option is to replace the D\\-Link router with a router which can run a Teredo relay. In my experience it will work reliably if you use a Linux machine with Miredo configured in relay mode for the router.\n\nDeploying your own Teredo relay on the D\\-Link router would not only mean that you no longer rely on a third party Teredo relay. It will also give you a native path between your Teredo relay and your LAN, thus you avoid two of the three third party 6to4 relays as well.\n\nWhat's left\n===========\n\nYou would still be relying on a single third party 6to4 relay. A Teredo client need to choose which Teredo server it will be using. The two Teredo clients I know of each have a default configured which will be used if you do not change the configuration yourself. The network path from the Teredo server to your D\\-Link router will have to pass through a 6to4 relay.\n\nSo what you need to do is to choose a Teredo server with access to a reliable 6to4 relay. Ideally a 6to4 relay should be configured on the machine running the Teredo server.\n\nIs this a recommendable configuration?\n======================================\n\nInstalling a Teredo relay on your router is definitely a reliability improvement as long as your router has a public IPv4 address. It will give a significant reliability improvement for any communication with Teredo users, and it will not have any impact on other communication. This is true regardless of whether your router is doing 6to4 or native IPv6\\.\n\nUsing 6to4 on your LAN is however not recommendable as many networks have not installed any 6to4 relays. Hosts on your LAN would often face problems communicating with hosts with native IPv6\\.\n\nUsing a Teredo client is not recommendable either due to all the same reasons that 6to4 isn't. However there are a few cases where Teredo can be useful. Most importantly a Teredo client can connect to hosts on the LAN behind your router (assuming your router has a Teredo relay). And sometimes I have come across CGN deployments working so poorly that Teredo through the CGN is more reliable than TCP through the CGN."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a network setup where Host 1 is using Teredo and Host 2 is using 6to4 for IPv6 connectivity, what is the most effective way to improve the reliability of communication between these hosts?\n\nA) Increase the number of third-party 6to4 and Teredo relays being used\nB) Replace the D-Link router with a Linux machine running Miredo in relay mode\nC) Configure Host 1 to use 6to4 instead of Teredo\nD) Install a Teredo server on Host 2\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B.

This new definition has better typesaftey since it requires a function, while yours will accept any value, and will do nothing unless there are side effect required to evaluate the value passed in. We also now call the function passed in for its side effects instead of just returning it.\n\nThe problem with `Unit` is that when a unit is required any value can be provided which will be automatically discarded for a `Unit`. For example, with your code `new Button(5)` is valid, as is the code `val x: Unit = 5`.\n\nThe reason the first code `class Button( act: => Unit) {def fire = act}` \"works\", is you call the method foo, and pass the result into the `Button` constructor. Since it's a by\\-name parameter `foo` doesn't actually run until it's used. When you then use the Unit value passed into the class, the expression needs to be evaluated so `foo` is fun.\n\nYou second example is different however, adding the underscore (`foo _`) now means that you are passing in the method itself as a function, instead of calling the method and passing in the result as in your first example. It's perfectly fine to pass a function in to the constructor even thought the type now is not `Unit` since as discussed earlier any value can be discarded and replaced by `Unit`. When you evaluate the Unit value, there are no side effects this time since you don't run the method to get the unit, just create a function which is the discarded without being run. `def fire = act`\n\nWhen you change the type to be a function. \n\n```\nclass Button( act: () => Unit) {def fire = act()}\n\n```\n\nnow only a `() => Unit` is a valid argument instead of anything, and the fire method runs that function."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Scala, consider the following class definition:\n\n```scala\nclass Button(act: => Unit) {\n  def fire = act\n}\n```\n\nWhich of the following statements is true about this implementation?\n\nA) This implementation is type-safe and will only accept functions as arguments.\nB) The class will accept any value as an argument, even if it's not a function.\nC) Using `foo _` as an argument will always cause the `foo` method to be executed when `fire` is called.\nD) The `fire` method will always execute the passed function, regardless of how it was passed to the constructor.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because this implementation is not type-safe. It will accept any value, not just functions.\nOption B is correct. The class will indeed accept any value as an argument due to the nature of by-name parameters and Scala's treatment of Unit.\nOption C is incorrect. Using `foo _` passes the method itself as a function, which doesn't get executed when `fire` is called.\nOption D is incorrect. The `fire` method's behavior depends on how the argument was passed. If a function was passed directly (like `foo _`), it won't be executed.\n\nThe key point is that this implementation using `act: => Unit` is not type-safe and can lead to unexpected behavior.

The way I do it is with a dynamic DNS provider like dyndns.org. \n\n1. Set up your router to prefer traffic out one connection. At the least, do this for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (there are benefits to this \\-\\- some web apps will not like it if you use the same session but bounce between different IPs, and will log you out). This means no HTTP(S) traffic goes out over your secondary connection unless the primary is down.\n2. Create a dynamic DNS account and record for office.ourfirm.com\n3. Install the dynamic DNS client on an internal server.\n\nWhen the dyn DNS client updates your record, it will usually come from your primary connection, and so everything will come to that IP. If the connection goes down, it will start coming from your secondary connection, and thus you get your failover. If you lose a connection, it will take up to as long as your dyn DNS client updates before coming back up (5 minutes maybe? less with \"pro\" accounts).\n\n---\n\nThere's two ways to do the dyn DNS account:\n\n1. Get a premium account where it can host DNS for you (you can host ourfirm.com, or just delegate office.ourfirm.com to the service).\n2. Create a domain using their hosting services, like ourfirm.dyndns.org (which will be an A record hosted by dyndns). Set up office.ourfirm.com to be a CNAME to ourfirm.dyndns.org. Often this method will be free.\n\n---\n\nOn a side note regarding fail\\-over, you mention two ADSL connections. That's great and all, but there are several considerations here:\n\n* If they're both accounts from the same provider, all you're really getting is redundancy from your DSL modem in your office. If the phone lines, your provider, or their upstream provider go down, you're still offline regardless of having a failover.\n* Do the lines come in on the same sets of phone lines? Most datacenters put in lots of effort to ensure their upstream connections come physically from different directions and come into the building in separate places. This ensures that eg, a construction crew can't take out a line and kill all your connections in one swoop.\n* If they're different providers, are they still on the same upstream connections? Figure out what your ISP's providers are (hopefully they have more than one). If you have two different ISPs but they both share the same upstream provider, you still aren't totally protected.\n* With DSL, often it's the phone company that provides the DSL and resells bandwidth and access to ISPs (eg, Bell Nexxia). In this case, you're still dependent on one company (your local phone company) to have their DSL network up, even if the actual internet bandwidth comes from different places.\n\n---\n\nAt my current office we have failover exactly as described, and our primary connection is cable, and our secondary is DSL. Nothing is shared between the two, and both are major ISPs with multiple upstream connections to the internet backbone. I'm sure somewhere it's vulnerable to a backhoe operator, but at least they're completely physically different cables maintained by different companies, so there's very little chance of something that will kill both.\n\nI'd highly recommend using two different technologies for the best redundancy. There are many possible ways to connect now, so it's not overly difficult or expensive in most places: cable, DSL, fibre, satellite, wireless, GSM/cellular."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to implement failover between two internet connections for their office.ourfirm.com domain. Which of the following approaches best addresses their needs while providing the most robust redundancy?\n\nA) Use round-robin DNS to alternate between the two ADSL connections\nB) Set up a dynamic DNS service with a client on an internal server, using two ADSL connections from the same provider\nC) Implement a dynamic DNS solution using two different technologies (e.g., cable and DSL) from separate providers with distinct upstream connections\nD) Create multiple A records in the DNS configuration, pointing to both ADSL IP addresses\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because round-robin DNS is not a true failover solution and doesn't provide seamless transition if one connection fails.\n\nB) is better than A, but using two ADSL connections from the same provider doesn't offer true redundancy, as both could fail if there's an issue with the provider or shared infrastructure.\n\nC) is the best option as it provides true redundancy by using different technologies (cable and DSL) from separate providers with distinct upstream connections. This minimizes the risk of both connections failing simultaneously due to a single point of failure.\n\nD) is incorrect because simply creating multiple A records doesn't provide automatic failover and could result in users attempting to connect to a non-functioning IP address.\n\nThe correct answer (C) aligns with the documentation's recommendation for using different technologies and providers to achieve the best redundancy, while also incorporating the dynamic DNS solution for automatic failover."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/03", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/109203", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/333/"], "docs_id": 109203, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do I remove a UI component child via Layout XML?\nFor example, from the below xml directive in `checkout_index_index.xml`.

Not the heatsink though, it's kind of metalic frame on the other side of motherboard around GPU and CPU area. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A GPU temperature of 90C is worrisome. Into the hundreds and it would likely instantly fail. 230C is nearly hot enough to melt tin and you would definitely have smelled something burning. I doubt highly that your GPU reached that real temperature. To be sure, you might want to carefully clean and then reapply the thermal paste to the GPU being careful to make an even, thin covering over the entire chip."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user replaced the thermal pad on their GPU with Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste. After the change, SpeedFan showed rapidly changing temperature readings of ~90\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C, and 230\u00b0C. What is the most likely explanation for these readings?\n\nA) The GPU is actually overheating and reaching dangerously high temperatures.\nB) The thermal paste was applied incorrectly, causing poor heat transfer.\nC) There is a malfunction in the temperature sensor or monitoring software.\nD) The GPU is experiencing thermal runaway and is about to melt.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The wildly fluctuating temperature readings (from 90\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C to 230\u00b0C) strongly suggest a malfunction in either the temperature sensor or the monitoring software (SpeedFan). A real temperature of 230\u00b0C would be hot enough to melt solder and cause immediate failure, which didn't occur. The user didn't report any burning smell or visible damage, further supporting that these extreme readings are likely due to a sensor or software issue rather than actual temperatures. While incorrect application of thermal paste (option B) could cause overheating, it wouldn't explain the erratic readings. Options A and D are ruled out because such extreme temperatures would cause immediate and noticeable hardware failure."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/08", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/312483", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/164438/"], "docs_id": 312483, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: People who don't have a critical mind.

I used trial and error on my development site.\n\nGoing into the database table `eav_attribute` and removing the following two values seems to have fixed the error: \n\n```\nID - 175 -  validation_status \nID - 257  - email\n\n```\n\nI'm not sure what validation status is and email seems to be a duplicate value. Regardless removing these two rows from the database table seems to have resolved the error. \n\nI have now implemented this on our live site.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For this kind of issue, it's really hard to find the root cause.

In Console tab, we can check the `address()` object.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GW8D6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GW8D6.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: When debugging a Magento 2.3.4 checkout issue related to custom attributes, which of the following is NOT a recommended debugging approach?\n\nA) Using Chrome DevTools to set breakpoints and inspect variables\nB) Adding a debugger statement in relevant Knockout.js templates\nC) Directly modifying the eav_attribute database table to remove problematic attributes\nD) Checking the address() object in the browser console when a debugger is triggered\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA, B, and D are all valid debugging approaches recommended in the discussion. Using Chrome DevTools (A), adding debugger statements to templates (B), and inspecting objects in the console (D) are proper debugging techniques. \n\nOption C, directly modifying the database table, is not a recommended debugging approach. While it was mentioned as part of the final solution, directly altering database tables without fully understanding the implications can be risky and is not a standard debugging practice.

The use of \"herded\" in this context emphasizes the forceful, controlling nature of the action. It suggests the subject is treating the other person almost like an animal, pushing or guiding them against their will. This word choice adds to the intensity and potentially violent or coercive nature of the scene, even though only one person is being moved.

If we move this antenna such that it accelerate first for a moment, and then it moves with constant speed, we can see that the frequency of the received light will be shifted instantly in antenna's frame(toward blue or red, doesn't matter). The question is, in antenna's frame after acceleration, (which is indeed inertia) how can the frequency of the light still be shifted? After all, the light transmitter is far like 100 light years away, so when antenna moves, in antenna's frame we would expect some kind of delay to see a movement for the the far star (transmitter) and ofcourse the Doppler shift effect (antenna is at the rest in its frame, so the only reason for receiving doppler shifted frequency would be the movement of transmitter itself in this frame). But there is no such delay in formulas at least. \n\nIf you don't get what i am trying to say note that in every frame, Doppler shift happens because of transmitter movements (every frame consider itself at the rest!). If transmitter starts its movement while it's 100 light years away, we will see transmitter movement and Doppler shift effect 100 years later. However, when antenna moves, there is no such delay which is very strange. It is as if transmitter doesn't move, but frequency has been changed out of thin air. \n\nI understand that in accelerated systems laws of physics changes, metric is different and etc. However, even by knowing accelerated frames metrics (like Rindler and such), i can't show that there is indeed a solution for this problem. Because after all, in reality antenna will recieve Doppler shifted light even after it maintains its speed and becomes inertia\n\nI won't accept an answer without math even though i might upvote one. Everybody can say that accelerated systems are different, i need a thorough solution.\n\nUpdate: you can generalize this question to every effects in SR, like Lorentz contraction between two points in a far away space. \n\nUpdate 2: Thanks to the help of all users, i am convinced that in accelerated frames there is nothing wrong with none local effects, for example if i rotate my head, i will see movement of stars immediately, hence @ThePhoton 's answer is acceptable for me now.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The question is, in antenna's frame after acceleration, (which is indeed inertia) how can the frequency of the light still be shifted?\n\nThe light frequency was always shifted in this frame. (i.e. the frequency was always different in this frame than in the frame where the receiver is intially not moving)\n\nYou have two inertial frames, we can call them \"A\" and \"B\". Initially the receiver is at rest in frame A, and then it accelerates until it is at rest in frame B. But frame B wasn't created by this action. Frame B always existed. The only difference is that initially the receiver is at rest in frame A, so it measures the source frequency in frame A. Later the receiver is at rest in frame B, so it measures the source frequency in frame B.\n\nBut the frequency of the light in the frame B never changed, so there's no reason to worry about how it could have changed instantaneously."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An antenna initially at rest relative to a distant star suddenly accelerates to a constant velocity v away from the star.

This is because the new inertial frame (where the antenna is at rest after acceleration) always existed, and in this frame, the light frequency was always different from the original frame. The antenna's acceleration merely caused it to transition from one existing inertial frame to another. There's no need for information to propagate to the star or for the star to \"move\" in the new frame. The frequency shift is a consequence of the change in reference frames, not a physical change in the light itself that needs to propagate.

And it is not difficult to find them.\n\nWe seek continued fractions of the form\n\n$\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[a,\\\\overline{b,c,2a}]$\n\nFirst off, add $a$ to get a \"pure\" periodic expression. We shall call the quadratic surd $x$:\n\n$x\\=a\\+\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[\\\\overline{2a,b,c}]$\n\nWe may then render\n\n$x\\=2a\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{b\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{c\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{x}}}$\n\nand upon clearing fractions\n\n$(bc\\+1\\)x^2\\+(b\\-c\\-2a(bc\\+1\\))x\\-(2ab\\+1\\)\\=0$\n\nNow comes the sneaky part. If the above quadratic equation over the integers is to have a root $a\\+\\\\sqrt{N}$, its other root must be $a\\-\\\\sqrt{N}$ forcing the linear coefficient to be exactly $\\-2a$ times the quadratic one! Thereby $b\\=c$ above and the quadratic equation simplifies to:\n\n$(b^2\\+1\\)x^2\\-2a(b^2\\+1\\)x\\-(2ab\\+1\\)\\=0$\n\nThis gives an integer radicand whenever $2ab\\+1$ is a multiple of $b^2\\+1$, in which cases the common factor of $b^2\\+1$ may be cancelled from the quadratic equation leaving the equation monic.\n\nSuppose, for example, we drop in $b\\=2$. Then $2ab\\+1$ is to be a multiple of $5$ and $a$ can be any whole number one greater than a multiple of $5$. Putting $a\\=1$ results in the \"trivial\" solution $\\\\sqrt{2}\\=\\[1,\\\\overline{2}]$, as the period is reduced from three to one due to $b\\=c\\=2a$. But this equality is avoided for larger eligible values of $a$ and we get a series of period $3$ solutions. In all cases $N$ is one fourth the discriminant of the monic polynomial obtained after cancelling out the $b^2\\+1$ factor:\n\n$a\\=6\\\\to \\\\sqrt{41}\\=\\[6,\\\\overline{2,2,12}]$\n\n$a\\=11\\\\to \\\\sqrt{130}\\=\\[11,\\\\overline{2,2,22}]$\n\n$a\\=5k\\+1\\\\to \\\\sqrt{25k^2\\+14k\\+2}\\=\\[5k\\+1,\\\\overline{2,2,10k\\+2}]$\n\nThere are more families of solutions like this with other values of $b$. Just put in an even positive value for $b$ (why even?) and turn the crank. You must put $a\\>b/2$ to avoid the collapse we saw above with $\\\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n---\n\nSo much for a repeat petiod of $3$, what about larger periods?\n\n**Claim:** For any positive whole numbers $r$ there are at least an infinitude of $\\\\sqrt{N}$ continued fractions having repeat period $r$ where $N$ is a whole number, having the following form:\n\n$\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[kP\\_r\\+1;\\\\overline{2,2,...,2,2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)}]$\n\n$P\\_r$ is a Pell number defined by $P\\_0\\=0,P\\_1\\=P\\_{\\-1}\\=1,P\\_r\\=2P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}\\\\text{ for } r\\\\ge 2$, and $k$ is a whole number $\\\\ge 0$ for $r\\=1$, $\\\\ge 1$ otherwise. The number of $2$ digits before the final entries is $r\\-1$.\n\nThe proof bears some similarities to calculating the general solution for $r\\=3$ above. First add $kP\\_r\\+1$ to the expression to make a purely periodic fraction:\n\n$x\\=kP\\_r\\+1\\+\\\\sqrt{N}\\=\\[\\\\overline{2(kP\\_r\\+1\\),2,2,...,2}]$\n\nThen\n\n$x\\=2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)\\+\\\\dfrac{1}{\\[2,2,...,2,x]}$\n\nBy mathematical induction on $r$ and using the recursive relation defined for Pell numbers in the claim it is true that\n\n$\\[2,2,...,2,x]\\=\\\\dfrac{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}{P\\_{r\\-1}x\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}$\n\nwith $r\\-1$ digits of $2$ in the block. When this is substituted into the previous equation the following is obtained:\n\n$x\\=2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)\\+\\\\dfrac{P\\_{r\\-1}x\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}$\n\n$x\\=\\\\dfrac{(2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_r\\+P\\_{r\\-1})x\\+2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_rx\\+P\\_{r\\-1}}$\n\n$(P\\_r)x^2\\-2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_rx\\-(2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2})\\=0$\n\nUpon completing the square and back\\-substituting $\\\\sqrt{N}\\=x\\-(P\\_rk\\+1\\)$ we obtain:\n\n$N\\=\\\\dfrac{(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2P\\_r\\+2(kP\\_r\\+1\\)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_{r\\-2}}{P\\_r}$\n\nUsing the Pell number recursion to eliminate $P\\_{r\\-2}$:\n\n$N\\=\\\\dfrac{(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2P\\_r\\+2(kP\\_r)P\\_{r\\-1}\\+P\\_r}{P\\_r}\\=(kP\\_r\\+1\\)^2\\+2kP\\_{r\\-1}\\+1$\n\nthereby identifying $N$ as a whole number.

I think, given that many devices in my network work but both the Thinkpad and the Ipod do not work, this is somewhat strange.\n\nThe following output might be useful:\n\n```\nmax@max-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-7th:~$ ifconfig\nenp0s31f6: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        ether f8:75:a4:08:16:da  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n        RX packets 4810  bytes 5092583 (5.0 MB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 3726  bytes 420311 (420.3 KB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n        device interrupt 16  memory 0xea200000-ea220000  \n\nlo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536\n        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0\n        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>\n        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)\n        RX packets 2341  bytes 210190 (210.1 KB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 2341  bytes 210190 (210.1 KB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\nwlp0s20f3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet6 fe80::9418:a3d9:4ff1:e94c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\n        inet6 fde2:8acd:e9d3:0:429a:b26:8370:18ce  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\n        inet6 2003:ec:3730:f00:c26b:1148:c6c6:b07c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>\n        ether 94:e6:f7:06:76:97  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n        RX packets 3674  bytes 1519570 (1.5 MB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 3531  bytes 605307 (605.3 KB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\nmax@max-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-7th:~$ iwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nwlp0s20f3  IEEE 802.11  ESSID:\"ZYXEL-133\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 04:BF:6D:55:0F:0E   \n          Bit Rate=86.7 Mb/s   Tx-Power=22 dBm   \n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:on\n          Link Quality=47/70  Signal level=-63 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:458   Missed beacon:0\n\nenp0s31f6  no wireless extensions.\n\n```\n\nThe command \"ip route show\" does not yield anything.

Go to network settings and uncheck the \"IPv6\". \n\n[https://linuxconfig.org/how\\-to\\-disable\\-ipv6\\-address\\-on\\-ubuntu\\-18\\-04\\-bionic\\-beaver\\-linux](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-disable-ipv6-address-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux)\n\nGoogle is probably reachable with IP v6\\.

They can connect to Google, but not to other websites. Based on the network configuration output provided, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The system's DNS settings are incorrect\nB) The wireless adapter is malfunctioning\nC) The system lacks an IPv4 address assignment\nD) The router is blocking access to non-Google websites\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The output of the ifconfig command shows that the wireless interface (wlp0s20f3) only has IPv6 addresses assigned, but no IPv4 address. This explains why the user can reach Google (which supports IPv6) but not other websites or even ping their router's IPv4 address. The lack of output from the \"ip route show\" command further confirms the absence of IPv4 routing. Disabling IPv6 or properly configuring IPv4 addressing would likely resolve the issue."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/24", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18518", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/49/"], "docs_id": 18518, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have many double entries in Launchpad.![see screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HEuZ.png) (Address Book, DVD Player, Image Capture). Any idea why and how to fix it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Launchpad looks for applications in at least two different locations: the Applications folder in your Home directory, and the \"root\" Applications folder sitting in \"Macintosh HD.\" If it sees an application in more than one place, it puts an icon on the Launchpad for each place it's in. (Try using Spotlight to see if you have more than one Address Book!)\n\nMoving the extraneous apps out of \\~/Applications should put them out of Launchpad's sight (at least, as of the next reboot)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You notice multiple icons for the same applications appearing in your Mac's Launchpad. What is the most likely cause of this issue and how can it be resolved?\n\nA) The applications are corrupted and need to be reinstalled. To fix this, uninstall and reinstall the affected applications.\n\nB) Launchpad's database is corrupted. To fix this, reset Launchpad by running a terminal command.\n\nC) The same applications exist in both the user's Home directory Applications folder and the root Applications folder. To fix this, move the duplicate applications out of the Home directory's Applications folder.\n\nD) The Mac's display settings are causing visual glitches. To fix this, adjust the screen resolution in System Preferences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of how Launchpad functions on a Mac. According to the documentation, Launchpad searches for applications in multiple locations, including the user's Home directory Applications folder (~\\Applications) and the root Applications folder. If an application exists in both locations, Launchpad will display multiple icons for it. The correct solution is to move the duplicate applications out of the Home directory's Applications folder, leaving only one instance in the root Applications folder. This will cause Launchpad to display only one icon per application after a system reboot."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/07/30", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/198898", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/109342/"], "docs_id": 198898, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm just finishing up adding outlets to the front and back of my house.

The circuit originates from the main panel, goes through a junction box, and then splits to feed outlets on the front and back of the house. If the electrician installs a GFCI outlet between the panel and the junction box, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) Only the outlets on one branch after the junction box will be GFCI protected\nB) The GFCI outlet will protect itself, but no other outlets on the circuit\nC) All outlets on both branches after the junction box will be GFCI protected\nD) The GFCI outlet will interfere with the proper functioning of the circuit and should not be installed in this configuration\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a GFCI outlet is installed upstream of a junction box, it provides GFCI protection to all downstream outlets, regardless of how the circuit branches after the GFCI. This is because all outlets are wired in parallel, and the GFCI protection extends to all devices on the load side of the GFCI outlet. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because GFCI protection doesn't discriminate between branches after a junction box. \nAnswer B is false because GFCI outlets protect all downstream devices, not just themselves. \nAnswer D is incorrect because this is a valid and common configuration for GFCI protection in outdoor circuits."}}
