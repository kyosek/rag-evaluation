It subtends a certain angle at your eyes, that is, it has a certain angular extension in your field of view. If you look at the moon through a telescope, the diameter of the virtual image created by the scope is much smaller than the actual diameter of the moon. So how does this help? It helps because the angle subtended by the scope's moon image is greater than that subtended by the moon without the scope. The scope provides angular magnification and that makes the moon look bigger. Angular magnification is used when the image is virtual, as in telescopes, binoculars and microscopes."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A student is observing the moon through a telescope with an angular magnification of 50x. The moon's actual angular diameter when viewed with the naked eye is approximately 0.5\u00b0. If the student adjusts the telescope to create a virtual image, what will be the apparent angular diameter of the moon as seen through the telescope, and what type of optical system is this telescope likely to be?\n\nA) 25\u00b0; Galilean telescope\nB) 1\u00b0; Keplerian telescope\nC) 25\u00b0; Keplerian telescope\nD) 0.01\u00b0; Galilean telescope\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The angular magnification of a telescope is defined as the ratio of the angular size of the image to the angular size of the object when viewed with the naked eye. Given that the magnification is 50x and the moon's actual angular diameter is 0.5\u00b0, we can calculate the apparent angular diameter through the telescope:\n\nApparent angular diameter = Actual angular diameter \u00d7 Magnification\n= 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 50 = 25\u00b0\n\nThis large apparent angular diameter indicates that the image is magnified significantly.\n\nThe question specifies that the telescope creates a virtual image. In optics, there are two main types of astronomical telescopes:\n\n1. Galilean telescopes, which produce an erect virtual image but have a narrow field of view.\n2. Keplerian telescopes, which produce an inverted real image at the focal plane, but when viewed through the eyepiece, create a magnified virtual image.\n\nGiven the high magnification and the creation of a virtual image, this is most likely a Keplerian telescope. Keplerian telescopes are more commonly used for astronomical observations due to their superior magnification and wider field of view compared to Galilean telescopes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 25\u00b0; Keplerian telescope."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/04", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/424907", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 424907, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When compiling the document, the pdf product looks like this:\n\n[![pictura](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uS1El.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uS1El.png)\n\nThe font size of the section is easy to change with `titlesec` package, but what about the remaining text? \n\nI have tried with `\\documentclass[size]{extreport}` but it doesn't works.

To get the argument to fly you don't need to actually *construct* the anti\\-diagonal string in the sense of print out all the digits (that would indeed be an infinite task)!

Instead, we only need to specify a rule for how this number differs from every number in the given list. This specification is finite and allows us to conclude that the new number is different from all numbers in the list without actually computing all of its digits.

Here's why:\n\n1. Segmenting the LED strips into groups and powering each with a 60A 5V supply distributes the load and reduces the risk of a single point of failure.\n\n2. Using an inverter to convert 12V DC to 120V AC allows for efficient power transmission through the slip rings. High voltage and lower current reduce power loss over the wires.\n\n3.

This approach allows for the use of standard slip rings rated for AC power, which are more readily available in high current ratings.\n\n5. The suggestion to use a GFCI after the inverter adds an extra layer of safety.\n\nOption A is incorrect because small buck converters may not be designed for current sharing and could lead to uneven load distribution.

To solve it:\n\n1) We need to calculate the probability of getting at least one ball of each color in 20 draws.\n2) It's easier to calculate the complement - the probability of missing at least one color.\n3) We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to account for overlapping cases.\n4) The calculation involves summing probabilities for different scenarios (missing one color, two colors, etc.) with appropriate signs.\n5) The final step is subtracting this probability from 1 to get the probability of selecting all colors.\n\nThe exact calculation is complex, involving many terms.

The scope and probe risetimes are usually typical ones and may vary for each probe. Likewise there are a lot of other error sources, not the least one being uncertainty in the scopes sampling and limited resolution (in most digital scopes you see a sinc interpolation of the signal, try finding a dot display mode to see how many datapoints there really are that you can base your measurement of).\n\nThus trying to calculate it that way can only be called a rough estimate.\n\nLets try some numbers to get a feeling here:\n\nThe real perfect data:\n\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{1\\.4ns^2 \\+ 1\\.8ns^2 \\+ 0\\.7ns^2} \\= 2\\.385ns\\\\$\n\nLets assume the system rise time is perfect, but just not the scopes timing:\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{\\-1\\.4ns^2 \\- 1\\.8ns^2 \\+ 2\\.36ns^2} \\= 0\\.608ns\\\\$\n\nAnd now lets assume the scope and probes are a bit off too:\n\\\\$\\\\sqrt{\\-1\\.45ns^2 \\- 1\\.85ns^2 \\+ 2\\.36ns^2} \\= 0\\.21ns\\\\$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is measuring the rise time of a signal using an oscilloscope and probe with the following specifications:\n- True signal rise time: 0.7 ns\n- Probe rise time: 1.4 ns\n- Oscilloscope rise time: 1.8 ns\n\nThe measured rise time on the oscilloscope is 2.385 ns.

might want to analyse the capture in WireShark \\- much easier). This is how your IPv6 host knows how to get out to the internet. Also watch for `Neighbor Solicitation` as this is the replacement for ARP.\n\nIf you see these requests coming in, but not going back out, then your internal firewall is blocking IPv6 traffic. If you see them going out (requests), but not back in, then you need to make sure that your prefix length is correct (that's the `/64` part. Although I've seen a lot of `/64`s being passed out that are actually a `/48`).\n\nBig Important Bold Bit\n======================\n\n**ICMP is absolutally critical for IPv6 functionality.** In IPv4 it can be blocked without huge impact, but in IPv6, the whole network relies on ICMP for all its functionality. Don't block it.\n\nIn reference to\n\n> My provider gave me a \"/64\" (whatever\n>  that is \\- I'm still confused) of IPv6\n>  addresses\n\nThat's your Prefix Length, previously known as your [Subnet Mask](https://serverfault.com/questions/49765/how-does-subnetting-work) that's used for [CIDR](https://serverfault.com/questions/12854/cidr-for-dummies). The lower the number, the more IP addresses you have. For IPv6, `/64` and `/48` are very common and should give you more IP addresses than you will ever need in your entire life."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An administrator is troubleshooting IPv6 connectivity issues.

Router Advertisements are how IPv6 hosts learn about default gateways, and Neighbor Solicitation replaces ARP for address resolution. These are fundamental to IPv6 operation.\n\nD is incorrect because a /64 prefix in IPv6 provides an enormous number of IP addresses, far more than a typical IPv4 subnet."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/20", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/575357", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/48263/"], "docs_id": 575357, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to define a function that takes a value which represents time and returns an integer. \nSo when using it, the function would look something like $f(t)$\n\nWhat is the right (or commonly used) domain for such a function?\n\n$f:T \\\\rightarrow Z$\n\nWhat would $T$ actually be?

They have a 25kg bag of self-leveling concrete mix that requires 6L of water. The contractor has a 24L bucket for mixing. Based on this information and the details provided, answer the following:\n\n1. Will the 24L bucket be sufficient for mixing the concrete?\n2. What is the approximate volume of the mixed concrete?\n3. If the contractor wants to cover a rectangular area of 4m x 3m, what would be the approximate thickness of the applied layer?\n\nA) Yes; 18L; 15mm\nB) No; 31L; 10mm\nC) Yes; 24L; 7.5mm\nD) Yes; 18L; 7.5mm\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\n1. The 24L bucket will be sufficient. The total volume of materials (25kg dry mix + 6L water) will be less than 24L.\n2. The approximate volume can be calculated from the coverage information provided: 18,000 cubic centimeters = 18L.\n3. Given that 18L covers 6 square meters at 3mm thickness, for a 12 square meter area (4m x 3m), the thickness would be approximately half of 3mm, which is 1.5mm. However, to use all the mixed concrete, the thickness would be 3mm x (6 sq m / 12 sq m) = 7.5mm.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately answers all three parts of the question based on the given information and calculations."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/11/08", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/302993", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/374676/"], "docs_id": 302993, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to edit [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24312260/javafx-application-hide-osx-dock-icon/32984600#32984600), because there is a code comment (that starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`) in the code, and that's why code wasn't shown properly.\n\nBut selecting the whole code and marking it as a code block or pressing `CMD` \\+ `K` button doesn't work.\n\nHow do I insert a code with comments in the answer?\n\nAnd the code should be marked up in the language it was written.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An alternative to the language tag is to add another level of indentation (which I do quickly with Notepad\\+\\+ or whatever code editor of your choice).\n\nSo effectively, what's in the answer currently...\n\n```\n\n<!-- language: lang-java -->\n\n    /**\n     - This class is intended to start application as AWT application before initializing\n     - JavaFX application.

If the integral of f(z) along any circle in D is zero, then f(z) is indeed analytic in D. This is a generalization of Morera's Theorem, as proven in the link provided. The proof involves showing that if the integral along all circles is zero, then the integral along all closed curves must also be zero, which by Morera's Theorem implies analyticity.\n\nOption B (triangles) and C (squares) are not sufficient.

Then let's assume they follow the [\"Salpeter birth mass function\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function) so that $n(M) \\\\propto M^{\\-2\\.3}$ (where $M$ is in solar masses) for $M\\>0\\.1$ to much larger masses. There are more complicated mass function known now \\- Kroupa multiple power laws, Chabrier lognormal, which say there are fewer low mass stars than predicted by Salpeter, but they don't change the gist of the argument. \nUsing the total number of stars in the Galaxy, we equate to the integral of $N(M)$ to get the constant of proportionality: thus \n$$n(M) \\= 1\\.3\\\\times10^{10} M^{\\-2\\.3}.$$\n\nNow let's assume most stars are on the main sequence and that the luminosity scales roughly as $L \\= M^{3\\.5}$ ($L$ is also in solar units), thus $dL/dM \\= 3\\.5 M^{2\\.5}$.\n\nWe now say $n(L) \\= n(M)\\\\times dM/dL$ and obtain\n$$ n(L) \\= 3\\.7\\\\times10^{9} M^{\\-4\\.8} \\= 3\\.7\\\\times10^{9} L^{\\-1\\.37}.$$\n\nThe total luminosity of a collection of star between two luminosity intervals is\n$$ L\\_{\\\\rm galaxy} \\= \\\\int^{L\\_2}\\_{L\\_1} n(L) L \\\\ dL \\= 5\\.9\\\\times 10^{9} \\\\left\\[L^{0\\.63} \\\\right]^{L\\_{2}}\\_{L\\_1}$$\nThis equation shows that although there are far more low\\-mass stars than high mass stars in the Galaxy, it is the higher mass stars that dominate the luminosity.\n\nIf we take $L\\_1\\=0\\.1^{3\\.5}$ we can ask what is the upper limit $L\\_2$ that gives $L\\_{\\\\rm galaxy} \\= 1\\.3\\\\times 10^{10} L\\_{\\\\odot}$ ($\\=5\\\\times10^{36}$ W)?\n\nThe answer is only $3\\.5L\\_{\\\\odot}$. But we see *many* stars in the Galaxy that are way brighter than this, so surely the Galaxy ought to be *much* brighter?\n\nThe flaw in the above chain of reasoning is that the Salpeter mass function represents the *birth* mass function, and *not* the present\\-day mass function.\nMost of the stars present in the Galaxy were born about 10\\-12 billion years ago.\nThe lifetime of a star on the main sequence is roughly $10^{10} M/L \\= 10^{10} M^{\\-2\\.5}$ years. So most of the high mass stars in the calculation I did above have vanished long ago, so the mass function effectively begins to be truncated above about $0\\.9M\\_{\\\\odot}$. But that also then means that because the luminosity is dominated by the most luminous stars, the luminosity of the galaxy is effectively the number of $\\\\sim 1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ stars times a solar luminosity.\n\nMy Salpeter mass function above coincidentally does give that there are $\\\\sim 10^{10}$ star with $M\\>1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ in the Galaxy. However you should think of this as there *have been* $\\\\sim 10^{10}$ stars with $M\\>1 M\\_{\\\\odot}$ born in our Galaxy. A large fraction of these are not around today, and that is actually the lesson one learns from the integrated luminosity number you quote!\n\nEDIT: A postscript on some of the assumptions made. The Galaxy is much more complicated than this. \"Most of the stars present in the Galaxy were born 10\\-12 billion years go\". This is probably not quite correct, depending on where you look. The bulge of the Galaxy contains about 50 billion stars and was created in the first billion years or so. The halo also formed early and quickly, but probably only contains a few percent of the stellar mass. The moderately metal\\-poor thick disk contains perhaps another 10\\-20% and was formed in the first few billion years. The rest (50%) of the mass is in the disk and was formed quasi\\-continuously over abut 8\\-10 billion years. (Source \\- [Wyse (2009\\)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0415v1.pdf)). None of this detail alters the main argument, but lowers the fraction of $\\>1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ stars that have been born but already died.\n\nA second point though is assuming that the luminosity of the Galaxy is dominated by main sequence stars. This is only true at ultraviolet and blue wavelengths. At red and infrared wavelengths evolved red giants are dominant. The way this alters the argument is that some fraction of the \"dead\" massive stars are actually red giants which typically survive for only a few percent of their main sequence lifetime, but are orders of magnitude more luminous during this period. This means the contribution of of the typical low\\-mass main sequence stars that dominate the stellar numbers is even *less significant* than the calculation above suggests."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 5\u00d710^36 Watts.

While the Milky Way has birthed many high-mass stars over its lifetime, most of these have already completed their life cycles due to their shorter lifespans. The current luminosity is dominated by stars around 1 solar mass, which represent the upper end of the surviving initial stellar population. This explains why the galaxy's total luminosity appears to correspond to about 10 billion solar-type stars, even though the total stellar count is much higher. Option A is incorrect because red dwarfs, while numerous, contribute little to the total luminosity. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't account for stellar evolution over the galaxy's lifetime.

The input is read, parsed, and the contents are stored on a structure for later use.\n\nNow, in general you want to keep into account transformation of the data from the input, such as adding default values when not specified, or adding full path information to relative path specified in the input. There are two different strategies to achieve this.\n\nThe first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time. In practice, you put all the intelligence into the input parser, and your application has no logic to deal with unexpected circumstances, such as an unspecified value. You lose the information of what was specified and what wasn't, but you gain in black\\-boxing the details. Your \"running code\" needs that information in any case and in a proper form, and is not concerned if it's the default or a user\\-specified information.\n\nThe second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior. unspecified values are not filled (which may however be a problem in languages not supporting None) and data is stored verbatim from the file. The intelligence for recovery must now go into the \"running code\", which must check what was specified in the file, eventually fall back to a default, or modify the input properly before using it. \n\nI would like to know your opinion on these two approaches, and in particular which one you found the most frequently implemented. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is, of course, a false dichotomy. The real answer is not this simple.\n\nAlso the presence or absence of `None` or `Null` isn't interesting (or even relevant).\n\n> The first strategy is to perform these transformations at input file reading time.\n\nIn the long run, this becomes a maintenance nightmare. \"black\\-boxing the details\" is a bad policy.\n\n> The second strategy is to have the file reader a real one\\-to\\-one mapper from the file to a memory\\-stored object, with no intelligent behavior.\n\nThat's a very weird way to put it, but that's one small part of a good architecture.\n\n**None**. `None` or `Null` is what you can call a *domain independent null* \\-\\- a universal nothing value. Some languages (like C) lack a domain independent null. That doesn't mean anything, because you have at least two ways forward.\n\n1. Domain\\-specific null. Input values like zero\\-length fields, or `999-99-9999` for a Social Security Number and stuff like that are domain\\-specific null values. You may have this kind of thing.\n2. Flags. The embedded SQL folks decided that the best way to handle SQL NULL in languages which don't have a domain\\-independent NULL is to provide an array of flags as null indicators. Applications in C (or COBOL or even FORTRAN) would have to check the null indicator for the presence of a SQL NULL. The actual field could have any random junk in it if the indicator said it was really a NULL.\n\n**Transformation**. For information on this, read up on ETL (Extract Transform Load) processing.\n\nApplications that process files naturally form a pipeline.\n\n1. Input reading. This byte\\-to\\-character processing. The least you can do to read. If you have Unicode decoders, they go here. Nothing more.\n2. Some kind of lexical scanning \\-\\- the basis for syntax recognition. If it's a CSV file, this is the comma or tab recognition.\n3. Some kind of file object parsing. This creates Domain Objects based on the file representation. For CSV or tab\\-delimited files, it creates a list of row values. \n\nFor XML files, 1, 2 and 3 are combined into an XML parser.\n4. Some kind of application object parsing. For CSV files, this is where you'd transform a sequence of objects into something more usable by your application. \n\nFor JSON, YAML or files, this creates the objects. Often, 2, 3 and 4 are all done by the load operation.\n\nAt this point you have an object in your application domain. Processing from this point forward is independent of the initial input format. In the applications I support, all of the previous processing is a separate library that handles XLS, XLSX, CSV and a few other formats for the inputs.\n\nOnce you have a application domain object, you then have to apply your application's rules. This varies a lot, of course. But here's the strategy.\n\n1. Write down the \"outer\" processing loop. `for object in source(): process( object )`. Maybe it involves decision making. `for object in source(): if valid( object): process( object )`. Whatever the high\\-level, end\\-user, easy\\-to\\-understand summary is.\n2. Odds are good that none of the input objects are actually suitable for this kind of processing. You have things like cleansing, filtering, validation, derived data calculation, foreign\\-key reference lookups and the final stage of persistence (update/insert/delete) processing. This forms a natural pipeline. \n\nDefine this pipeline from \"back to the front\". \n\nWhat must be true of the objects so they can fit with your ideal outer loop? \n\nWrite down all the conditions that must be true. (cleaned this way and that way, filtered for this that and the other, calculations done for this and that, etc., etc.)\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for the persistence step?\n\nWhat's the last thing that has to be done to prepare for that?\n\netc. \n\nUntil you've run out of \"last thing to be done to prepare\" and you're looking at the input objects and a pipeline of steps to prepare them for their final persistence.\n3. For each stage in the pipeline, design the simplest transformation function you can get away with to do just that operation on each input object, cleaning, filtering, validating, deriving data, doing lookups and finally doing whatever persistence thing must be done.\n\nEach of these stages will have to make use of the null indicators, BTW. \n\nSome of these will be generic and reusable. Some won't be. Don't think about reuse. Discover reuse after you've written the same code 3 or more times.\n\n**Object Updates**. There are at least two ways to handle the transformations.\n\n1. Update the objects as you go. This is classic \"OO\" design. Stateful objects.\n2. Create new objects from old objects. This is more of the functional programming design. Immutable objects. In some languages, this requires more memory management. On the other hand, if each object is immutable, the pipeline becomes simpler because each stage expects a specific data type and creates an object of a different specific data type."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing an application that processes input files and transforms data, which of the following approaches is considered the most maintainable and flexible in the long run?\n\nA) Perform all data transformations and apply default values during the initial file reading stage, creating a black-box system.\n\nB) Create a one-to-one mapper from the file to memory-stored objects with no intelligent behavior, leaving all transformation logic to the main application code.\n\nC) Implement a pipeline approach with separate stages for input reading, lexical scanning, object parsing, and application-specific transformations.\n\nD) Use a single, monolithic function that handles file reading, parsing, and all data transformations in one step.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I have a circuit that has a solar panel and some other power sources and I am to do a circuit analysis when there is no sun and show how it affects the system. \n\nHowever I have been told that in reality if solar panels are not fitted with blocking diodes then they will drain the battery or consume power from other sources if they are hooked up to it. So would I treat a solar panel as a source of power dissipation at night or would I simply assume it creates a short circuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you mean \"open circuit or source of power dissipation\" \\- if it was short circuit it would cause substantial power dissipation.\n\nSummary: It is usual to fit blocking diodes and good practice but on small to medium panels at voltages under say 100V it is probably not strictly necessary. \n\n**Detail:**\n\nIt is usual to fit blocking diodes to prevent reverse current when Vbattery is \\> Vpanel.\n\nI have an experimental setup here with a 30Vmp 250 Wmp panel so Imp is about I\\=W/V \\~\\= 8\\.3A. Those are the values you would get in full sun (insolation about 1 sun \\= 1000 W/m^2\\). It's 10:45pm here at present and the panel is in near complete darkness. I just applied 25VDC to the panel and it drew 40 mA or about 0\\.04/8\\.3 \\~\\= 0\\.5% of full current. That is not a trivial amount but may be acceptable. In a typical day with say 4 sunshine hours the % current lost at that rate is in the order of say 12 hours x 40 mA / (4 hours x 8\\.3A) \\=\\~ 1\\.5% of the day's insolation wasted. The current lost will be higher at the dark to day transitions but still probably modest \\- see below. \n\nIn practice the ability of the panel to pass current relates to the current that it would provide if optimally loaded. Consider maximum power \\= Wmp to occur at 1 sun of insolation \\= 1000 W/m^2\\. For much of the light level range from about 5% x 1 sun or less up to 1 sun the panel is close to a current source with current close to being proportional to light level and Vout being about 70% of max output at low light levels and close to Vmp at most light levels above 10%. Vpanel only falls substantially at say 1% x 1 sun or less. \n\nThe implications of the above is that when Vpanel is well below battery voltage the current it will support is minimal and in the dark it is about zero. While a blocking diode will prevent this loss it also has potential losses of its own. A schottky diode will drop say 0\\.4V to 0\\.6v in smaller systems depending on load and more than that in large systems. On a say 12V battery system Vmp is typically 18V (which is probably higher than needed for most situations). A fully charged floated lead acid battery requires about 13\\.7 V and you \"never\" need over 15V so a diode drop is not too problematic except in VERY low light conditions. \n\nAt very high voltages (hundreds of volts) you can get cell breakdown in some cases and diodes seem like a good idea.

When you sever a neutral, you cut off current flow, and the downline load \"lifts\" the neutral wire to 120V. Now you have 120V across those two neutrals. When you touch them together again, you complete the circuit and the downline load comes back on again. The spark is small because it's current\\-limited by what the downline load will draw. \n\nBetween neutral and ground, it's because you have paralleled neutral and ground. **when you parallel 2 wires (don't), current flows in proportion to their *conductivity*.** The conductivity of neutral and ground are pretty close, so when you do that (don't), about half the current flows via ground instead of neutral. Again the downline load limits current, so the spark stays small. \n\nWhy is neutral and ground not precisely the same voltage? Because neutral is *workin' for a living*, and ground is not. You're seeing **voltage drop on the neutral**, which since a neutral starts at 0V, tends to *lift* the neutral's voltage up a volt or two. It's the same effect as a beam\\-style torque wrench: the heavy beam bends with the many foot\\-pounds of torque, but the indicator beam is under no strain, so remains straight. The difference indicates torque. \n\nIf you knew the exact resistance of the neutral wire, you could compute current using that observed ground\\-neutral voltage difference \"E\", and known neutral resistance \"R\", plug them into E\\=IR and out pops I, your amps. \n\nOh yeah... your bulbs\n---------------------\n\nYour problem is completely unrelated to this garden walk through the world of neutrals and bonding. The readings you're asking about were a red herring, sorry. Since you have a DVM, measure voltages on circuits in your house which work \\- as many as possible \\- and look for anything weird, *especially* some below 120V with others equally *above* 120V."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a residential circuit where light bulbs frequently burn out. They measure 4.2V between the line and neutral/ground with the switch off, and observe sparks when touching neutrals together or neutral to ground. What is the MOST likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The neutral and ground are improperly bonded throughout the house, causing a voltage potential between them.\n\nB) There is a loose connection in the neutral wire, causing voltage drop and current to flow through alternative paths.\n\nC) The light switch is faulty, allowing a small amount of current to pass even when in the off position.\n\nD) The sparks are normal behavior caused by capacitive coupling in the wiring, and unrelated to the bulb issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The sparks observed when touching neutrals together or neutral to ground indicate there is current flowing through the neutral wire even with the switch off. This suggests a loose connection in the neutral, causing voltage drop (explaining the 4.2V reading) and allowing current to flow through alternative paths when the neutrals are touched together. A loose neutral connection can cause voltage fluctuations that lead to frequent bulb burnouts. Options A and C don't fully explain all the observations, while D incorrectly dismisses the relevance of the sparks to the problem."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/02/06", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/252101", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/18339/"], "docs_id": 252101, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am having problems configuring the uncomplicated firewall (ufw) to allow outgoing multicast traffic.

It allows IGMP traffic with a TTL of 1 for IPv4, which is typically used for local network multicast. For IPv6, it allows specific ICMPv6 types (130, 131, 132, and 143) with a hop limit of 1, which are used for multicast group membership maintenance. This configuration directly addresses the error messages mentioned in the question, which were related to IGMP and ICMPv6 multicast traffic being blocked.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it uses TCP instead of IGMP and ICMPv6, which are the protocols used for multicast traffic management.\n\nOption C, while allowing general UDP multicast traffic, doesn't specifically address the IGMP and ICMPv6 issues mentioned in the error messages.\n\nOption D only addresses IPv4 IGMP traffic and doesn't include any rules for IPv6 multicast, making it an incomplete solution."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/09", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/122010", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/6450/"], "docs_id": 122010, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Source: [Absolute FreeBSD: The Complete Guide to FreeBSD, 2nd Edition by Michael W.

It's not the main verb (which is \"will give\"), nor is it an independent clause as it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.
