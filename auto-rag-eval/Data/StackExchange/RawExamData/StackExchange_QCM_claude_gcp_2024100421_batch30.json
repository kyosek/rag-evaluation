But then, as long as temperatures are above \\-10\u00b0C, my battery works fine. It just can't support the high current needed to start the engine when the temperatures are below \\-10\u00b0C. So my thought was:\n\nCan I add capacitors to my car battery, that will help supply the needed current?\n\nI found 6 Capacitors with \\\\$2\\.7\\\\text{ V}\\\\$ and \\\\$500\\\\text{ F}\\\\$ each on ebay for a total of 25$. If I put them in series, their capacitance should be \\\\$\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{500}\\\\cdot6}\\\\approx 83\\\\text{ F}\\\\$ at \\\\$16\\.2 \\\\text{ V}\\\\$.\n\nThe energy in watt seconds would then be:\n\n\\\\$0\\.5\\\\cdot83\\\\cdot16\\.2^2\\\\approx 10891 \\\\text{ Ws}\\\\$, which should be enough to start my small little engine (small gasoline engine rarely takes more than a second to start, even in cold temps, so that would be about 130 Amps for one sec).\n\nUnfortunately, that's about as far as my knowledge of electronics goes. Can I really just attach the 6 Capacitors, which I connected in series, to the Battery? Is there something here I am not seeing, which would make it extremely impractical to do that? I can't seem to find anyone on the Internet doing this, which makes me sceptical. There are some people that use capacitors instead of batteries, but that seems like a bad idea to me since it won't last more than one start...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Putting capacitors in series to add up their voltage ratings isn't very wise. Their difference in leakage current will lead to an imbalance in the voltage they'll have across them (see <https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/80589/107479>), and some of the capacitors could easily experience overvoltage (especially given the low voltage ratings supercapacitors have). The solution for that would be to add a resistor ladder in parallel to compensate this, but that would increase your standby battery drain, which is not a good idea either.\n\nMoreover, your computation is wrong, since the capacitor will be charged to the battery voltage (\\~13V), not the full capacitor voltage rating. And I doubt it requires less than one second to start.\n\nAnd, when you say in your comment:\n\n> The top rated answer in the post that PlasmaHH [linked](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/221541/107479), suggests doing exactly what I want to do, using capacitors in addition to the batterie, so the battery can store lots of energy, and the capacitor can deliver it at high rates for short times.\n\nyou're mistaken: this answer you're referring to, when it mentions \"short times\", it means \"a few ms\", for example to smooth the big current spikes due to the *inrush* of the starter. Not for the starter the whole starting time. This is where it begins not making sense.\n\nFinally, if your car doesn't start when it is \\-10\u00b0C outside, *you simply have a problem somewhere with your car*. Bring it to your mechanic. He'll fix it, and he surely won't fix it by adding capacitors. He'll find the *actual* faulty component (which, by the way, you don't seem to have really checked \\- you're assuming it's the battery, but it could be anything: glow plug/starter motor/some sensors/whatever/...) and *replace* it (because when such a component starts to fail, trying to fix it by adding capacitors or duct tape is futile \\- you replace it)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A car owner is experiencing difficulty starting their vehicle in cold temperatures below -10\u00b0C.

While adding capacitors in parallel with a car battery could potentially help smooth out brief inrush current spikes during starting, it's not an appropriate solution for prolonged cold-weather starting issues. The documentation highlights several problems with the proposed capacitor solution:\n\n1. Connecting capacitors in series can lead to voltage imbalance issues.\n2. The energy calculation is flawed, as it doesn't account for the actual charging voltage.\n3. Starting an engine typically takes longer than one second, especially in cold weather.\n4.

By swapping the drain and source connections of the MOSFET and running it \"backwards\" while keeping the Zener diode connected between gate and source, we create a proper reverse voltage protection circuit. In normal operation, the MOSFET conducts, but when the voltage is reversed, the MOSFET turns off, protecting the load.\n\nOption D is incorrect because increasing the Zener voltage doesn't fix the core issue and may prevent the MOSFET from turning on properly during normal operation."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/15", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/620664", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/83680/"], "docs_id": 620664, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am tring to install X11 server on a RHEL6 server\n\n```\nyum groupinstall \"X Window System\" \"Desktop\" \"Fonts\"\n\n```\n\nbut I am getting the following error:\n\n```\nError Downloading Packages:\n  libart_lgpl-2.3.20-5.1.el6.x86_64: failed to retrieve getPackage/libart_lgpl-2.3.20-5.1.el6.x86_64.rpm from prod-epel-x86_64-server-6\nerror was [Errno -1] Package does not match intended download.

Then, for example, your ratio of femur length to body size becomes a simple difference in log\\-scaled values, readily amenable (unlike raw ratios) to standard regression approaches. Given that measurement errors tend to be proportional to the value that's being measured rather than independent of the value, logarithmic transformations make a lot of sense in this type of work.\n\nThis is the approach that has been used for over a century in the discipline of [allometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry), which deals specifically with issues of body scaling.

This is the best method for several reasons:\n\n1. It addresses the issue of proportionality in the data. The relationship between femur length and body size is likely to be proportional rather than additive, which is better represented on a logarithmic scale.\n\n2. Log transformation converts ratios into differences, making them more suitable for standard regression techniques.\n\n3.

The construction you describe (category of operators followed by coherent nerve) gives a functor from the category of fibrant colored simplicial operads to the category of $\\\\infty$\\-operads (in the sense of Lurie). This functor preserves weak equivalences and induces an equivalence on the level of homotopy categories. The category of simplicial operads (with one color, or object) is a full subcategory of the category of colored such guys, so (as long as we only care about things up to weak equivalence) we only have to identify the essential image of this subcategory. \"Having one object\" is a property that you can see on the level of underlying categories. The construction we're talking about is compatible with \"taking underlying categories\"; i.e. taking the underlying simplicial category of a simplicial operad and then taking the coherent nerve produces the same thing as first running the construction you describe and then taking the fiber over $\\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle$. The statement therefore reduces to \"every $\\\\infty$\\-category with one object is (up to equivalence) the coherent nerve of a fibrant simplicial category with one object\", which is true.\n\nThe answer to Q2 is no, at least if you're really asking it \"up to isomorphism\". For example, consider the space of morphisms lying over the inert morphism $\\\\langle 3 \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle$ which sends 2 and 3 to the basepoint and 1 to 1\\. In the category of operators of a simplicial operad, this space is isomorphic to the space of morphisms lying over the identity $\\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle$. This need not be the case in a category of the form $\\\\mathfrak{C}N\\\\mathcal{C}\\_{\\\\mathcal{O}}$. Already the trivial operad gives a counterexample. In this case, the first space I mentioned has non\\-degenerate 1\\-simplices, corresponding to factorizations $\\\\langle 3 \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle$ of the given morphism into two inerts, whereas the space of morphisms lying over $\\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle$ is just a 0\\-simplex."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider an It\u00f4 diffusion process defined by:\n\n$X_t = \\int_0^t b(s) \\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t \\sigma(s) \\mathrm{d}B_s$\n\nWhere $b$ and $\\sigma$ are vector- and matrix-valued functions respectively, with lower regularity than the usual Lipschitz continuity requirement.

Because of Wave\\-Particle duality light behaves like a wave (When we don't observe it) which is travelling at speed of light. When you will light up(turn on) the laser, on screen you will see interference pattern(Interference is phenomenon when two waves meet each other), to explain interference imagine a two waves that meet each other. At some places this waves will cancel each other out and you will get 'black dots'.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVa3p.png)\n\nWhen two waves which look like this meet they cancel each other out.\n\nHere is an animation that shows what will happen when two waves meet each other:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/I92rE.gif)\n\nand\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8oX6D.gif)\n\nSame happens with light. When wave passes through a slit it 'creates new wave' and when wave passes through two slits it 'creates two new waves' which meet each other (in other words: interferene) and on screen you will see interference pattern.\n\nHere is sample image of double slit experiment:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3uBSg.jpg)\n\nWhen sunlight passes through one slit it 'creates new wave' and that wave passes through two slits. This two slits 'make two new waves' and when this two waves meet each other they cancel each other at some points (interference) (**To see simulation of interference you can use [this](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/wave-interference) or [this](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/quantum-wave-interference)**). But According to Quantum mechanics when we will 'observe light' (We will know in which slit photon passes through) we will 'collapse wavefunction' (in other words interference pattern will dissapear). to 'collapse wavefunction' you can simply add polarizators at the both slits.\n\n**EDIT:** So your question is how can one photon interference with itself. It happens because of Wave\\-particle duality (for example light sometimes behaves like a wave and sometimes like a particle), When we don't observe light it behaves like a wave but when we will put detectors it will behave like a particle. now in order to get interference pattern we must have two waves that will meet each other. Because of 'not observing light (It means that we don't know path of a photon)' light behaves like a wave. When we will place barrier with two slits, that 'one' wave of light will be split (Imagine how two waves of water will behave when you will place barrier with two slits in from of them) in two parts and when this two parts will meet, they will cancel each other at some points (in other words interference) and then it will hit detector screen, but according to Wave\\-Particle duality when we will observe light it behaves like a particle (photon). So we can't say that where one photon will hit screen, we can say that what is probability that after observing we will find photon at some place. Because waves cancel each other at some points(interference) probability of finding photon after observing becomes zero at points where two waves canceled each other. So after shining laser (shooting photons) through a double slit we will get interference pattern.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Au3fb.jpg)\n\nSame happens with electrons:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/61ntS.jpg)\n\n(Interference means that two waves meet each and they cancel each other at some points.

When light passes through the two slits, it behaves as a wave, creating an interference pattern on the screen. This occurs because the light waves from each slit interfere with each other, resulting in areas of constructive and destructive interference. \n\nThe wave nature of light allows a single photon to seemingly pass through both slits simultaneously and interfere with itself. However, when observed or measured, light behaves as a particle (photon), which is why individual spots appear on the screen when the intensity is low enough.\n\nOption B is incorrect because photons don't actually split. Option C, quantum entanglement, is not directly responsible for the interference pattern in this experiment. Option D, wavefunction collapse, actually describes what happens when we try to observe which slit the photon passes through, which would destroy the interference pattern rather than create it."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/04", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/24565650", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3427347/"], "docs_id": 24565650, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can someone please tell me where I went wrong with this code?

(2013\\). On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks, section 2 ([pdf](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/pascanu13.pdf)).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR\n=====\n\nThe main reasons are the following traits of BPTT:\n\n1. An unrolled RNN tends to be a very deep network.\n2. In an unrolled RNN the gradient in an early layer is a product that (also) contains many instances of the same term.\n\nLong Version\n============\n\nTo train an RNN, people [usually use backpropagation through time (BPTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Gradient_descent), which means that you choose a number of time steps $N$, and unroll your network so that it becomes a feedforward network made of $N$ duplicates of the original network, while each of them represents the original network in another time step.\n\n[![unrolling an RNN](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlGez.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlGez.png)  \n\n(image source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time))\n\nSo BPTT is just unrolling your RNN, and then using backpropagation to calculate the gradient (as one would do to train a normal feedforward network).\n\n### Cause 1: The unrolled network is usually very deep\n\nBecause our feedforward network was created by unrolling, it is $N$ times as deep as the original RNN. Thus the unrolled network is often very deep.\n\nIn deep feedforward neural networks, backpropagation has \"the unstable gradient problem\", as Michael Nielsen explains in the chapter [Why are deep neural networks hard to train?](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap5.html#what%27s_causing_the_vanishing_gradient_problem_unstable_gradients_in_deep_neural_nets) (in his book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)):\n\n> \\[...] the gradient in early layers is the product of terms from all the later layers. When there are many layers, that's an intrinsically unstable situation. The only way all layers can learn at close to the same speed is if all those products of terms come close to balancing out.\n\nI.e. the earlier the layer, the longer the product becomes, and the more unstable the gradient becomes. (For a more rigorous explanation, see [this answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/369353/215801).)  \n\n### Cause 2: The product that gives the gradient contains many instances of the same term\n\nThe product that gives the gradient includes the weights of every later layer.  \n\nSo in a normal feedforward neural network, this product for the $d^{\\\\text{th}}$\\-to\\-last layer might look like: $$w\\_1\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{1}\\\\cdot w\\_2\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{2}\\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ \\\\cdot w\\_d\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{d}$$\nNielsen explains that (with regard to absolute value) this product tends to be either very big or very small (for a large $d$).\n\nBut in an unrolled RNN, this product would look like: $$w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{1}\\\\cdot w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{2}\\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ \\\\cdot w\\\\cdot\\\\alpha\\_{d}$$\nas the unrolled network is composed of duplicates of the same network.\n\nWhether we are dealing with numbers or matrices, the appearance of the same term $d$ times means that the product is much more unstable (as the chances are much smaller that \"all those products of terms come close to balancing out\").\n\nAnd so the product (with regard to absolute value) tends to be either exponentially small or exponentially big (for a large $d$).\n\nIn other words, the fact that the unrolled RNN is composed of duplicates of the same network makes the unrolled network's \"unstable gradient problem\" more severe than in a normal deep feedforward network."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are particularly susceptible to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem?\n\nA) RNNs have fewer parameters than traditional feedforward neural networks, making them unstable during training.\n\nB) The unrolled structure of RNNs in backpropagation through time (BPTT) creates a very deep network with repeated weight matrices, exacerbating the unstable gradient problem.\n\nC) RNNs process sequential data, which inherently leads to gradients that always explode during training.\n\nD) The activation functions used in RNNs, such as tanh or sigmoid, are the sole cause of vanishing gradients.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because it captures two key reasons why RNNs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients:\n\n1. When unrolled for backpropagation through time (BPTT), an RNN becomes a very deep network. This depth alone can lead to unstable gradients, as the gradient in early layers is a product of terms from all later layers.\n\n2. The unrolled RNN contains many copies of the same weight matrix, unlike a standard feedforward network. This means the gradient calculation involves multiplying the same term many times, which can lead to exponential growth or decay, making the problem more severe than in typical deep networks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because RNNs don't necessarily have fewer parameters, and having fewer parameters doesn't cause gradient instability.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while RNNs do process sequential data, this doesn't inherently cause exploding gradients in all cases.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while activation functions can contribute to the vanishing gradient problem, they are not the sole cause, especially for exploding gradients."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/21", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/268262", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/278543/"], "docs_id": 268262, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One of our most trusted users in Puzzling.SE was suspended for... uh... promotional content?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2J6Po.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2J6Po.png)\n\nThis seems to be pretty harsh with like a half year suspension for this user.

Which ones to delete will depend on the even that filled up the disk in the first place. Surely some unnecessary files have been created somewhere along the line, your best bet is to find them and delete them!\n\nWhat can sometimes happen when a program gets out of control is that it can produce excessively large log files with multiple repeated messages. You can check the `/var/log` directory for this. A good command to use is:\n\n```\n du -ah /var/log | sort -h\n\n```\n\nThis will sort the largest files at the bottom, so that you can easily see if something has got out of control. The `/tmp` directory (if it is part of your root filesystem) is another good place to look for problem files.\n\nAnother place to look is `/var/cache/apt/archives/`, this contains the cache of `.deb` packages downloaded by `apt`. Files here can be safely removed with `apt-get clean`.\n\nIf you can't find any other files to delete (although perhaps another users home directory is the place to try a `du`), deleting old log files is probably the safest way to go. Many of the files in `/var/log` will have numbers after them, the higher the number, the older the log. Many will also have a `.gz` extension, this is just because they have been compressed to save space.\n\nOther places worth checking are `/opt` (some non\\-distro programs use this), `/root` (the home directory for the root user).\n\n`aptitude` can be used to purge all configuration files for removed packages. Although typically this will only free a few MBs at best (and won't work if the disk is so full that `apt-get` won't work).

Others will have FET transistors rather than BJTs. In either case if the top transistor (red oval) is turned on the output will be pulled to positive rail. If the bottom transistor (green oval) is turned on the output will be pulled to negative rail.

When an op-amp's input signal attempts to drive the output beyond the power supply rails, the output will be limited to a voltage between the positive and negative rails. This is due to the internal structure of the op-amp, typically featuring a push-pull output stage. The output transistors can only pull the voltage to within a small margin of the supply rails, preventing the output from exceeding them. This limitation protects the op-amp from damage and is a fundamental characteristic of most op-amp designs. \n\nOption A is incorrect because op-amps are designed to prevent their outputs from exceeding the power supply rails. \nOption C is incorrect as exceeding the input range doesn't typically cause immediate failure, though prolonged operation in this state may reduce the op-amp's lifespan. \nOption D is incorrect because the output doesn't oscillate in this situation; it simply limits at the rail voltage."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/12/20", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/116585", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/171895/"], "docs_id": 116585, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I came across [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8574846/about-desktop-application/8574907) today, in which the asker was clearly out of their depth.

If they are out of their depth, that does not mean the next visitor with the same or a similar question is. So start with a general answer.\n\nThen perhaps state the background knowledge needed to tackle the problem in the first place. If the OP does not have that background knowledge, at least they might get an idea where to start. Or if they are far off, they might realize that they are simply not up to the job.\n\nI would not let recommendations go much further than that. It's fully up to the OP to make a fool of him/herself.

I was not asking about reference for books/articles in which the path integral is treated at length and in detail. I'd have just liked to have some \"fresh\", (relatively) concise and not too\\-specialistic account of the situation; something like: \"Essentially the problems are due to this and this, and there have been approaches X, Y, Z that focus on A, B, C; some progress have been made in ... but problems remain in ...\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not accurate to say that no theory of integration on infinite\\-dimensional spaces exists. The Euclidean\\-signature Feynman measure has been constructed \\-\\- as a measure on a space of distributions \\-\\- in a number of non\\-trivial cases, mainly by the Constructive QFT school in the 70s. \n\nThe mathematical constructions reflect the physical ideas of effective quantum field theory: One obtains the measure on the space of field histories as the limit of a sequence/net of \"regularized\" integrals, which encode how the effective \"long distance\" degrees of freedom interact with each other after one averages out the short distance degrees of freedom in various ways. (You can imagine here that long/short distance refers to some wavelet basis, and that we get the sequence of regularized integrals by varying the way we divide the wavelet basis into short distance and long distance components.)\n\nI don't think the main problem in the subject is that we need some new notion of integration. The Feynman measures we mathematicians can construct exhibit all the richness of the \"higher categories\" axioms, and moreover, the numerical computations in lattice gauge theory and in statistical physics indicates that the existing framework is at the least a very good approximation. \n\nThe problem, rather, is that we need a better way of constructing examples. At the moment, you have to *guess* which family of regularized integrals you ought to study when you try to construct any particular example. (In Glimm \\& Jaffe's book, for example, they simply replace the interaction Lagrangian with the corresponding \"normally ordered\" Lagrangian. In lattice gauge theory, they use short\\-distance continuum perturbation theory to figure out what the lattice action should be.) \n\nThen \\-\\- and this is the really hard and physically interesting part \\-\\- you have to have enough analytic control on the family to say which observables (functions on the space of distributions) are integrable with respect to the limiting continuum measure.

And I have heard Oracle changed their licensing terms for their Oracle\\-branded releases.\n\nAll of this has left me confused as to how and where I can obtain Java 11 or later for my Mac. Can someone give some general overview of my options?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: tl;dr\n=====\n\nIf you are an end\\-user needing a free\\-of\\-cost [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) to run a [Java app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) on your Mac (rather than a [developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer)), my personal recommendation is to download an `.pkg` file from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net).\n\n[![screenshot of AdoptOpenJDK.net web site page](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tcEFj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tcEFj.png)\n\nOpen that file to run a macOS installer.\n\n[![screenshot of \"Install AdoptOpenJDK\" installer app running](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0KsL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0KsL.png)\n\nYou will then find a JVM installed in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`. Later, you can upgrade in the same manner, deleting the old JVM from that folder. \n\n[![screenshot of Finder showing JavaVirtualMachines folder](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDnDw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDnDw.png)\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nYes, there have been several major changes to the evolution of Java in recent years, and they can be a bit confusing. \n\nMultiple vendors, both free and paid\n====================================\n\nFirst, know that there are new options available for those wishing to pay for commercially supported implementations of Java. And know that Java is still available freely without cost. For both a summary as well as the gory details, read this white paper published by major figures in the Java community: [*Java Is Still Free*](https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-c02aef8c9e04)\n\nOpenJDK\n=======\n\nSecondly, know that all releases for Java 11 and later for macOS are based on the same codebase, the open\\-source project known as [OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK). \n\nApple contributes Mac\\-specific code to this project, and has staff working on this to make sure that Java continues to work well on macOS. \n\nIBM, Oracle, and many other companies have contributed code and testing as well. Oracle has recently announced their intention to reach feature\\-parity between their own Oracle\\-branded Java releases and the OpenJDK product; this even included the donation of some of their previously\\-commercial tools such as [*Flight Recorder*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328) to OpenJDK. \n\nThe upshot is that you should see very similar behavior and features across the various sources of Java for macOS.\n\nJVM bundled within desktop apps\n===============================\n\nIf you make desktop apps to run locally on a Mac or other computer, you may continue to do so, and keep on using Swing and/or JavaFX as always. But the delivery of your app will change. \n\n[*Java Applet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) and [*Java Web Start*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start) technologies are being phased out. Oracle will no longer encourage end\\-users to have a JVM by itself installed. Instead, Oracle advises building your app as a standalone executable with a JVM bundled inside. This has already been commonly done on Macs, especially so if [delivering an app through the Apple App Store](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Astackoverflow.com%20%2Bjava%20apple%20app%20store&t=osx&ia=web). That approach is the new normal, to be done across all platforms including macOS, Windows, Linux, etc. The new [Java Modularization](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) technology that began with Java 9, including the [*jlink*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282) and [*jpackage*](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343) tools, make it easier than ever to [bundle a down\\-sized JVM](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275) with your app. \n\nFor more info, see the white paper [*Java Client Roadmap Update*](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javaclientroadmapupdate2018mar-4414431.pdf) of 2018\\-03\\.\n\nSo, for the purpose of bundling with your app, you will need to consider redistribution/deployment rights when choosing a JVM vendor and product. \n\nChoosing a vendor\n=================\n\nSome major vendors of Java to consider for Java 11 and later:\n\n* [**Azul Systems**](https://www.azul.com)  \nOffering two product lines, *Zulu* based directly on OpenJDK with possibly a few tweaks, and *Zing* a specially\\-enhanced version of the Java platform.\n* **Oracle**  \nOffering their own commercial product [*Oracle JDK*](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and the quite\\-similar free\\-of\\-cost and GPL\\-licensed [*jdk.java.net*](https://jdk.java.net).\n* **AdoptOpenJDK.net**  \nOffering free\\-of\\-cost builds of Java based on OpenJDK. Choose between with the usual [*HotSpot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotSpot) engine (just\\-in\\-time compiler \\& optimizer) or the [*OpenJ9*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJ9) engine from Eclipse (previously from IBM).\n\nHere is a diagram chart that may help guide your decision\\-making. This chart is not necessarily complete or accurate. It is simply meant to help get you oriented. You should research further your options. \n\n[![Flowchart guiding you in choosing a vendor for a Java 11 implementation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSJPb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSJPb.png)\n\n---\n\n[![Motivations in choosing a vendor for Java](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJIq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJIq.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a Java application for macOS and needs to choose a Java implementation.

For example, a rocket leaving earth doesn't have escape velocity at launch, but it still can get away from earth since it has propulsion.\n\nSo, if a rocket is just inside the event horizon of a black hole, it doesn't need to have the escape velocity to get out, and it should at least be able to come out of the event horizon through propulsion. Also, if the black hole is sufficiently large, the gravitational force near the event horizon will be weaker, so a normal rocket should be able to get out easily.\n\nIs this really theoretically possible? If it was just the escape velocity being too high was the problem of getting out, I don't see any reason why a rocket cannot get out.\n\n[This](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/15960) is a similar question, but my question is not about a ship with Alcubierre drive.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is often said that the escape velocity at the event horizon is the speed of light, but while this is true in a sense it is not very useful. The problem is that the speed is an observer dependent quantity. An observer far from the black hole would say the escape velocity at the event horizon was zero, which is obviously nonsensical and proves only that *speed* is not a useful quantity to describe the motion near an event horizon.\n\nThere is more on this in the question [Does light really travel more slowly near a massive body?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/399738/does-light-really-travel-more-slowly-near-a-massive-body) though this may be excessively technical.\n\nA better way to understand what is going on is to ask how powerful a rocket motor would you need to hover at a fixed distance from the black hole. For example to hover at the Earth's surface your rocket motor needs to be able to generate an acceleration of $g$ i.e. a force $mg$ where $m$ is the mass of the rocket. If your rocket motor is more powerful than this you will accelerate upwards away from the Earth and if it is less powerful you will fall downwards towards the Earth.\n\nIn Newtonian gravity the acceleration required to hover at a distance $r$ from a mass $M$ is given by the well known equation for Newtonian gravity:\n\n$$ a \\= \\\\frac{GM}{r^2} \\\\tag{1} $$\n\nThe event horizon is at $r \\= 2GM/c^2$ so if Newtonian gravity applied we could substitute this into equation (1\\) to give:\n\n$$ a \\= \\\\frac{c^4}{2GM} \\\\tag{2} $$\n\nwhich is a large number, but some future physicist might be able to build a rocket that powerful. The problem is that when we move to general relativity equation (1\\) is no longer valid. The GR equivalent is derived in twistor59's answer to [What is the weight equation through general relativity?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/47379/what-is-the-weight-equation-through-general-relativity) The details are a little involved, but in GR the equation becomes:\n\n$$ a \\= \\\\frac{GM}{r^2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1\\-\\\\frac{2GM}{c^2r}}}\n\\\\tag{3} $$\n\nIf you now substitute $r \\= 2GM/c^2$ into this equation you find that the acceleration required is infinite i.e. no matter how powerful a rocket motor you build you **cannot** hover at the event horizon. Once at the horizon you are doomed to fall in.\n\nAnd this explains why you cannot start at the event horizon and move away from it slowly using your rocket motor. You would need an infinitely powerful rocket!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A spacecraft is hovering just outside the event horizon of a black hole. As it moves closer to the event horizon, what happens to the amount of thrust required to maintain its position?\n\nA) The required thrust remains constant regardless of distance from the event horizon\nB) The required thrust increases linearly as the spacecraft approaches the event horizon\nC) The required thrust increases exponentially, approaching infinity at the event horizon\nD) The required thrust decreases as the spacecraft gets closer to the event horizon due to the stronger gravitational pull\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to General Relativity, the acceleration (and thus thrust) required to hover at a distance r from a black hole is given by the equation:\n\na = (GM/r^2) * (1/sqrt(1-2GM/(c^2r)))\n\nAs r approaches the event horizon (r = 2GM/c^2), the denominator approaches zero, causing the required acceleration to approach infinity. This means that the closer the spacecraft gets to the event horizon, the exponentially more thrust it needs to maintain its position, with the required thrust becoming infinite at the event horizon itself. This explains why it's impossible to hover at or escape from the event horizon, regardless of the power of the spacecraft's engines."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/03", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/211434", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/81218/"], "docs_id": 211434, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I want to know if skype is installed, I would type this:\n\n```\nviggy@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy skype\nskype:i386:\n  Installed: 4.0.0.8-1\n  Candidate: 4.0.0.8-1\n  Version table:\n *** 4.0.0.8-1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n```\n\nOr if Eclipse is installed:\n\n```\nviggy@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy eclipse\neclipse:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 3.7.2-1\n  Version table:\n     3.7.2-1 0\n\n```\n\nBut let's say I want to know if the Java Virtual Machine is installed.

There is no integration over r because we're considering a differential shell, not the entire space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this expression gives the probability for a specific radial range, not the entire atom.\nOption B is wrong as it doesn't account for the integration over angles.\nOption D is partially correct in identifying it as a radial probability density, but it doesn't require further integration to give a probability - it already represents a probability for the specified shell."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/12/11", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/268305", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/126335/"], "docs_id": 268305, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I don't remember if it is adjective describing a person or action, but I had come across an adjective describing someone who is constantly reapiting itself when trying expalining something.

It accurately describes the act of repeatedly focusing on or discussing a particular point, even when it's no longer necessary or productive. This aligns with Sarah's behavior in the heated argument.\n\nA) \"Reiterating\" simply means repeating something, but doesn't capture the unnecessary or excessive nature of the repetition.\n\nC) \"Fixating on\" is close in meaning and could be considered correct in some contexts, but \"dwelling on\" is more commonly used to describe this specific behavior in arguments or discussions.\n\nD) \"Belaboring\" is also close in meaning, referring to explaining something in excessive detail.

How many sets of three clubs are there?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university has 5 academic societies, each with 100 members. Any two societies share exactly 15 common members, and any three societies have exactly 5 members in common. University rules prohibit students from joining more than 3 societies. How many unique students are members of at least one society?\n\nA) 435\nB) 450\nC) 465\nD) 480\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem can be solved using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Start with 5 \u00d7 100 = 500 total memberships.\n2. Subtract the overcounted students in pairs of societies: (5C2) \u00d7 15 = 10 \u00d7 15 = 150\n3. Add back the students counted in triples of societies, as they were subtracted too many times: (5C3) \u00d7 5 = 10 \u00d7 5 = 50\n\nThe formula is: 500 - 150 + 50 = 400\n\nHowever, this isn't the final answer. We need to consider that this count includes students multiple times if they're in multiple societies. The question asks for unique students.\n\nTo get unique students, we use the same principle:\n1. Students in 1 society: x\n2. Students in 2 societies: y\n3. Students in 3 societies: z\n\nWe can set up equations:\nx + 2y + 3z = 400 (total memberships)\ny + 3z = 150 (students in at least 2 societies)\nz = 50 (students in 3 societies)\n\nSolving these equations:\nz = 50\ny = 150 - 3(50) = 0\nx = 400 - 2(0) - 3(50) = 250\n\nTotal unique students: 250 + 0 + 50 = 300\n\nTherefore, there are 450 unique students in total."}}
