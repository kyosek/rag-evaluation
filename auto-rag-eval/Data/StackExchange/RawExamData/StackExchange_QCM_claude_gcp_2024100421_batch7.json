Armies were likewise said to \u201clive off the land\u201d or \u201coff the country\u201d\u2014meaning that in wartime they obtained what they needed by appropriating it from the territories they crossed rather than being supplied from home. \n\nA similar use of *off* appears in the phrase *dine off* (pheasant, the haunch, six or seven courses) meaning one obtains one\u2019dinner from these sources. \n\nSo to say that \u201cShe lives off her parents\u201d means she obtains the necessities of life from her parents; to say that \u201cI've been living off rats\u201d means I get my nutrition by eating rats."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the phrase \"She lives off her parents,\" what does the preposition \"off\" most accurately indicate?\n\nA) The physical location where she resides\nB) The source of her financial support\nC) The distance between her and her parents\nD) The frequency of her visits to her parents\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The preposition \"off\" in this context indicates the source of one's sustenance or support, not a physical location. It originates from phrases like \"living off the land,\" where it denotes obtaining resources from a particular source.

[Strickland's notes](https://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/courses/homotopy/cgwh.pdf) call this *compactly generated*.\n\nBy compact I mean not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\nThe reason I ask is that standard constructions of non $k$\\-spaces for example the square of the one\\-point compactification of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ and the product $\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\setminus \\\\{1,\\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}$ where the second quotient means identifying $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ to one point, are usually not locally compact.\n\nI'm looking for a locally compact space which is not a $k$\\-space.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is that, assuming AC, there are locally compact spaces which are not compactly generated. (That is, do not have topologies which are final with respect to all maps with compact Hausdorff domains. i.e. do not belong to the monocoreflective hull of the class of compact *Hausdorff* spaces as computed in $Top$.)\n\nThe construction of such a space is due to J. Isbell, *[A Distinguishing Example in k\\-Spaces](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1987-100-03/S0002-9939-1987-0891170-3/)*, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. **100** (1987\\), 593\\-594\\. Below is my attempt at his details.\n\nLet $X\\=\\\\omega\\_1\\+1$, where $\\\\omega\\_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, and topologise $X$ by giving it the base of *closed* sets generated by $(i)$ countable initial segments $\\[0,\\\\alpha]$, and $(ii)$ the singleton $\\\\{\\\\omega\\\\}$. The space $X$ is our counterexample.\n\n> $X$ is locally compact.\n\n*Proof*: Indeed, more is true: every subspace of $A\\\\subseteq X$ is compact. For $A$, if nonempty, contains a least element, every neighbourhood of which contains all of $A$ except for possibly $\\\\omega\\_1$. $\\\\square$\n\n> $X$ is not compactly generated.\n\nProof: The claim is that there is a non\\-closed subspace $A\\\\subseteq X$ with the property that whenever $f:K\\\\rightarrow X$ is a continuous function with $K$ a compact Hausdorff space, the preimage $f^{\\-1}(A)$ is a closed subset of $K$. We will show that the open subspace $A\\=\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ has this property.\n\nSo take $K$ and $f$ as above and suppose $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega)\\\\subset K$ is not closed. Fix a countable ordinal $\\\\alpha\\_1$ and consider the closed set $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq K$. This is disjoint from the closed set $K\\\\setminus f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$, so by normality of $K$ there are disjoint open sets $U\\_1,V\\_1\\\\subset K$ with $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq U\\_1\\\\subseteq X\\\\setminus V\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$. Because we are assuming that $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is not closed we have $X\\\\setminus V\\_1\\\\neq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha)$, so in particular the inclusion $U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is proper. Thus there is a countable $\\\\alpha\\_2\\>\\\\alpha\\_1$ for which there is a proper inclusion $U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_2]$.\n\nNow iterate the process to obtain a sequence of proper inclusions\n$$f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_1]\\\\subseteq U\\_1\\\\subseteq f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_2]\\\\subseteq U\\_2\\\\subseteq\\\\dots$$\nSince $\\\\bigcup\\_\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\alpha\\_i$ is countable, $\\\\bigcup f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\alpha\\_i]\\=f^{\\-1}(\\\\bigcup \\[0,\\\\alpha\\_i])$ is closed in $K$ and hence compact. On the other hand it is covered by the $U\\_i$, but by no finite subfamily of them. Thus there is a contradiction. It must be that $f^{\\-1}\\[0,\\\\omega\\_1\\)$ is closed in $K$. $\\\\square$\n\n*Remark*: $(i)$ All that was needed of $K$ was its compactness and normality.

Here's why:\n\n1. X is locally compact: Every subspace of X is compact. For any nonempty subset A of X, the least element of A has a neighborhood that contains all of A except possibly \u03c9\u2081. This makes X locally compact.\n\n2. X is not a k-space (or compactly generated): The open subspace A = [0,\u03c9\u2081) is not closed in X, but for any continuous function f from a compact Hausdorff space K to X, f\u207b\u00b9(A) is closed in K. This violates the definition of a k-space.\n\n3. X is not Hausdorff: The points \u03c9\u2081 and any \u03b1 < \u03c9\u2081 cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\n4. The fact that X is locally compact but not a k-space makes it a counterexample to the idea that all locally compact spaces are k-spaces.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while X is not Hausdorff, this wasn't part of the key properties we were looking for.\nOption B is incorrect on both counts - X is locally compact and is not a k-space.\nOption D is incorrect because X is indeed locally compact, even though it's not a k-space."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/27", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/50754", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/20272/"], "docs_id": 50754, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When using the virtual terminals on TTY 1\\-6 \\[\\*], it's sometimes easy to forget to log out: The screen goes blank after a while, but I'm still logged in \\- no password required, anyone can use my account.

If that's a problem you could go back to using the interrupt and set it for `CHANGE` and keep track of the time between when the line goes high and low again. It would be something like the following untested code:\n\n```\n#define MY_PIN 0 // Make sure this matches the interrupt line\nunsigned long start_micros = 0;\nunsigned long last_duration = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(9600);\n    pinMode(MY_PIN, INPUT);\n    attachInterrupt(0 , PWM_handler, CHANGE);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n   if (last_duration >= 1750)\n      Serial.println(\"TX on\");        \n}\n\nvoid PWM_hander()\n{\n    if (digitalRead(MY_PIN) == HIGH)\n        start_micros = micros();\n    else\n        last_duration = micros() - start_micros;\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using a radio control receiver with an Arduino for servo control, which of the following approaches is most appropriate and why?\n\nA) Use interrupts triggered on CHANGE to constantly monitor the receiver's signal, as this provides the most responsive control.\n\nB) Connect the receiver's output directly to a servo, bypassing the Arduino entirely, as the PWM signal is already suitable for servo control.\n\nC) Use the pulseIn() function to measure the duration of the PWM signal from the receiver, interpreting pulse widths to determine control inputs.\n\nD) Configure the Arduino to generate its own PWM signal based on serial input, ignoring the receiver's output completely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach for this scenario. Using the pulseIn() function allows the Arduino to measure the duration of the PWM signal coming from the radio control receiver. This method is suitable because:\n\n1. It doesn't rely on interrupts, which can be problematic with constantly changing PWM signals from the receiver.\n2. It directly measures the pulse width, which corresponds to the desired servo position or control input.\n3. It allows for simple thresholding (e.g., pulses \u2265 1.75ms considered \"on\") to interpret the control input.\n4. While it may cause some delay due to the blocking nature of pulseIn(), it's generally sufficient for most RC applications.\n\nOption A is incorrect because constant interrupts can lead to erratic behavior with PWM signals. Option B bypasses the Arduino's control, which isn't the goal. Option D ignores the receiver entirely, which defeats the purpose of using radio control."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/27", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/143287", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4836/"], "docs_id": 143287, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are some examples of non\\-Lambertian light scatters/radiators in everyday life?

There are multiple scattering from the rough wood surface producing Lambertian scattering but there is also specular reflection from the varnished top layer of wood. \n\nLambertian scattering depends on the surface having a sufficiently random level of roughness. Once you start reducing the roughness or randomness you will get non\\-Lambertian diffuse scattering. There will be a directional component to amount of scattering so by tilting the surface you will be able to detect it. The peak scattering angle will depend on the degree of roughness but it will be at the same angle of the specular reflection for only slight roughness.

Let's say I want to make it a IPv6 only. I want to do it with only gigabit\\-capable devices. I can do that through a router or an L3 switch.\n\nLet's take these two as an example:\n\n* 5 gigabit port router (e.g. [http://routerboard.com/RB2011iL\\-IN](http://routerboard.com/RB2011iL-IN))\n* 24 gigabit port L3 switch (e.g. [http://routerboard.com/CRS125\\-24G\\-1S\\-IN](http://routerboard.com/CRS125-24G-1S-IN))\n\nAssume IPv4 is not used and features such as VPN tunnels are also not important.\n\nAre there any obvious issues with using L3 switch instead of a router in this scenario? E.g. lower security, lower throughput, etc.\n\nTo phase the question differently \\- why would you use one or another in similar scenarios?\n\nOr to phase differently again \\- what are the scenarios for most people (residential or very small business users) that would require one or another or where picking one or another would be superior?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nTo clarify, this is a new setup and I'm looking at two options:\n\na) The standard `inside network <-> dummy switch <-> router <-> internet`, where all devices are connected to a dummy switch and the router is playing a firewall role\n\nb) The router\\-less `inside network <-> L3 switch <-> internet`, where devices are connected to an L3 switch that is at the same time playing a role of a firewall\n\nOption a) is both more complex (two devices to administrate) and more costly (need to buy both a dummy switch and a router). Option b) is potentially less secure and could have other cons (that's what I'm trying to figure out).\n\nSince this is a home / small business setup, I'm not interested in anything except the above, so NAT, VPN, other WAN\\-type connectivity options, BGP routing, etc. are not something I'm looking for. I.e. it's pretty much as bare\\-bones setup as any other residential customer \\- I just need to be able to connect to the Internet and have standard security.\n\nSpecifically, on the page for the L3 switch I linked to I found:\n\n\u2022 RouterOS gateway/firewall/VPN router with passive cooling\n\nSo it *should* support all I need (and more), but then again I'm wary of the marketing and looking for some input about this. Most importantly, whether others have a similar setup (while preferred, absolutely not restricted to the one I linked \\- just something in the similar price range, e.g. up to $250 or so) and some facts about why the setup is good or not.\n\nTo clarify even more, I am leaning towards the L3 switch setup because it's simpler in my opinion. I am trying to figure out whether going with L3 switch has any obvious deficiencies that I would want to avoid, most importantly from security and throughput / latency standpoints. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since this is a home network, although a large one, I would counsel a router\nas being more versatile. A router can do NAT, QoS, Voice gateway,\naccess control lists (security) and more,\nwhile a switch usually cannot.\n\nAnother difference (might not apply here), is that L3 switches do not offer the same WAN\\-type ports (T1, T3, etc.) that a standard router does.\n\nThe L3 switch will act like a switch when it is connecting devices that are on the same network, and like a stripped\\-down router when connecting externally.\nIn general, you want to use a router when most of the time the device does routing. Likewise, you want to use a switch when when most of the time the device does switching. In other words, if one of the main purposes of the device\nis to connect externally, use a router. If its main purpose is to connect \nbetween local/internal devices, use a switch.\n\nThe specifications for your L3 switch includes a firewall, but I'm not sure\nhow good it is. In general a router has its own IP address(es) while a\nswitch doesn\u2019t. I would prefer a router for better protection against attacks\ncoming from the Internet.\nRouting software knows how to deal with different IP packets, such as ICMP and others, but switches don\u2019t.\n\nAs regarding future expansion, multiple routers can be connected together as a network, but not switches.\n\nThe advantage of the L3 switch is that it will be much faster on switching\npackets, but the question only you can answer is whether you need that speed.\n\nIn all, for security and versatility I would advise using a router\nfor a home network.\n\nYour linked router is defined as \"a low cost multi port device series\" for $99\\.\nGiven that the L3 switch you are considering is priced at $189,\nyou could afford a better router for the same price.\nI would also counsel a router that supports the\n[DD\\-WRT firmware](https://www.dd-wrt.com/site/) with easy installation,\njust in case you would need more functionality in the future.  \n\n(Note : Product recommendations are disallowed on this forum.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business is setting up a new network with approximately 20 devices and wants to implement IPv6 only.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the choice between these two devices for this scenario?\n\nA) The L3 switch is the superior choice as it offers higher throughput and lower latency for internal network traffic.\n\nB) The router is the better option due to its ability to handle NAT, QoS, and provide more robust security features.\n\nC) The L3 switch is preferable because it can connect multiple networks together more efficiently than a router.\n\nD) There is no significant difference between the two options for this specific use case, so the choice should be based solely on cost.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The router is the better option for this small business network scenario. While the L3 switch may offer faster internal switching, the router provides several advantages that are crucial for a small business network:\n\n1. Better security features: Routers typically offer more robust firewall capabilities and are better equipped to protect against attacks from the internet.\n\n2. Versatility: Routers can handle NAT, QoS, and other advanced networking features that may be useful for a small business, even if not immediately required.\n\n3. Future-proofing: Routers can be more easily connected to form larger networks if the business expands.\n\n4. Dedicated WAN port: Routers are designed to connect directly to internet service providers, which is typically more straightforward than using an L3 switch for this purpose.\n\n5.

As my studies didn't offer any statistics courses, I'm having trouble to understand what type of statistical analysis I should perform on my data. After describing the data, I hope some of you can tell me more about this.\n\nTwo groups of possible factors / variables influencing CSR have been identified: company\\-specific and country\\-specific.\n\nFirst, company\\-specific variables are\n\n* `MKT_AVG_LN`: the marketvalue of the company\n* `SIGN`: the number of CSR treaties the company has signed\n* `INCID`: the number of reported CSR incidents the company has been involved in\n\nSecond, each of the 4,000 companies in the dataset is headquartered in one of 35 countries. For each country, I have gathered some country\\-specific data, among others:\n\n* `LAW_FAM`: the legal family the countries' legal system stems from (either French, English, Scandinavian, or German)\n* `LAW_SR`: relative protection the countries' company law gives to shareholders (for instance, in case of company default)\n* `LAW_LE`: the relative effectiveness of the countries' legal system (higher value means more effective, thus for instance less corrupted)\n* `COM_CLA`: a measurement for the intensity of internal market competition\n* `GCI_505`: mesurement for the quality of primary education\n* `GCI_701`: measurement for the quality of secondary education\n* `HOF_PDI`: power distance (higher value means more hierarchical society)\n* `HOF_LTO`: country time orientation (higher means more long\\-term orientation)\n* `DEP_AVG`: the countries' GDP per capita\n* `CON_AVG`: the countries' average inflation over the 2008\\-2010 timeframe\n\nIn order to make an analysis on this data, I \"raised\" the country\\-level data to the company\\-level. For instance, if Belgium has a `COM_CLA` value of 23, then all Belgian companies in the dataset have their `COM_CLA` value set to 23\\. The variable `LAW_FAM` is split up into 4 dummy variables (`LAW_FRA`, `LAW_SCA`, `LAW_ENG`, `LAW_GER`), giving each company a 1 for one of these dummies.\n\nThis all results in a dataset like this:\n\n```\nCOMPANY MKT_AVG_LN ... INCID ... LAW_FRA LAW_SCA ... LAW_SR LAW_LE COM_CLA ... etc\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   1      1.54          55          0       1          34     65     53\n   2      1.44          16          0       1          34     65     53\n   3      0.11           2          0       1          34     65     53\n   4      0.38          12          1       0          18     40     27\n   5      1.98         114          1       0          18     40     27\n   .       .             .          .       .           .      .      .\n   .       .             .          .       .           .      .      .\n 4,000    0.87           9          0       1           5     14     18\n\n```\n\nHere, companies 1 to 3 are from the same country A, and 4 and 5 from country B.\n\nMy DV, `GSE_RAW` is a numerical value for each companies' CSR behavior given by a rating agency.\n\n* I believe the country\\-level variables are also called \"categorical\" variables, as many companies share the same value for these variables (in the example above, companies 1 to 3 all share the same values for `LAW_FRA` to `COM_CLA`). I believe to have found out that \"categorical\" variables are also known as fixed factors. Is all this true?\n* I believe an OLS regression analysis is not the proper model here because of the categorical (country\\-level) variables. It has been proposed to use \"Generalized Linear Models\" (GLS), using the country\\-level variables as (fixed?) \"factors\" and the company\\-level variables as \"covariates\". Is this correct? And as a subquestion: why exactly is OLS not appropriate because of the country\\-level variables? What is it what they do in the OLS calculations that makes them set off the regression?\n\n`[edit 1]` I am using SPSS for statistical analysis\n\n`[edit 2]` Here my attempt to create a GLM using this data. However, I am unable to not get the \"you haven't specified a custom model\" Do I have to select all 4 variables here (becaus I want a beta and significance level for all 4 of them to construct a regression model)? And if so, why do I have to do this twice? I already said in a previous dialogue box that `DEP_AVG` and `CON_AVG` are fixed factors and that `SIGN` and `INCID` are covariates. Why would I, for instance, insert `INCID` here as a covariate, but not include it in the model building dialogue? Also, I really don't understand the output I'm getting, since it is very different from ordinary OLS output (the only output I'm slightly comfortable with). \n\n* Am I now doing the right analysis?\n* How can I get a regression model from this?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ewFeo.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether a variable is categorical depends only on the variable, not on any \"sharing\" of common values. In your case, LAW\\_FAM is categorical because it has four discrete categories: FRA, SCA, ENG, GER. In particular, LAW\\_FAM is nominal: the categories have no ordering. You could have several countries which happen to have exactly the same DEP\\_AVG, but that doesn't make DEP\\_AVG a categorical variable.\n\nI would suggest that you look at [Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model), since you have hierarchical data: country\\-level data and company\\-level data nested within countries.\n\nYour post is very good: you include enough details to help us help you. One more thing that would also help us point you in the right direction is to know what software you will be using for your analysis.\n\nEDIT: You ask about Generalized Linear Models, which are chosen for specific kinds of dependent variables. For example, if you were wanting to predict a categorical variable, you'd use Logistic Regression (which is done with a GLM)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A law student is conducting research on factors influencing corporate social responsibility (CSR) behavior of companies.

The sum S = \u03a3(k=1 to n-1) sin^m(\u03c0k/n) is indeed related to the imaginary parts of the n-th roots of unity. Specifically, sin(\u03c0k/n) represents the imaginary part of the k-th n-th root of -1 in the complex plane. \n\nThe sum of the m-th powers of these imaginary parts can be expressed as a polynomial in elementary symmetric functions of these parts. This is because any symmetric polynomial in the roots of a polynomial can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric functions of those roots.\n\nTo find the specific polynomial, one would start with the equation (x + iy)^n + 1 = 0, which represents the n-th roots of -1, and then eliminate x to get a polynomial in y (the imaginary parts). This resulting polynomial would have the sin(\u03c0k/n) terms as its roots.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the result is often algebraic, it's not always a simple trigonometric function.

I'm wondering if it is a good idea/practice to split log messages so that errors and warnings go to stderr while debug/informational/notice messages go to stdout instead? Or is this irrelevant given that many dedicated logging processes only read from stdin anyway, which requires source log messages in stderr and stdout be combined and redirect to logger's stdin. \n\n\\[Update]\n\nThe two answers below both mentioned syslog, I think I need to clarify the setup in detail. \n\nThe daemon processes I asked are running in foreground by themselves. Daemonization is managed by supervising processes such as `runit` or `supervisord`. In both cases, the stderr and stdout of the daemon processes will be captured by the supervising processes, and it's the supervising processes' job to decide how and where to store the logs (might be syslog, or somewhere else in the network over UDP). The daemon processes don't have to worry about what and where to write logs, as they just write to stdout/stderr. \n\nIn the case of `runit`, its logging facility `svlogd` will read from its stdin for the redirected log messages, which are combined stderr/stdout of the managed daemon process. As for `supervisord`, it can record stderr and stdout to separate log files. \n\nSo in this specific settings, is it a good practice to split logs between stderr and stdout, or just write to one of them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, something important to clarify: `STDOUT` and `STDERR` are rarely relevant within the context of a daemon process once it has successfully started, unless you're invoking one with a debugging switch.\n\nThe whole point of a daemon is that it needs to disassociate itself from having a controlling terminal, so that it can persist after logout. Once there is no terminal, all messages need to be sent to either a syslog daemon or a log file managed directly by the process.\n\nIf you are not actually referring to daemons, and really just mean any shell script or similar that you're writing yourself, then the logic should generally be this:\n\n* `STDOUT`: Anything you want being trapped by pipes or basic output redirection.\n* `STDERR`: \"Out of band\" messages. Things you want hitting someone's terminal anyway, even if they're doing some kind of redirection. (hence why they're associated with errors) Let the user decide if they also want to redirect these messages as well, i.e. redirecting `STDERR` to `STDIN` as you mentioned."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating a logging system for a set of daemon processes managed by supervisord.

This allows for a logical separation of log messages based on their severity or type.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while daemon processes typically don't use stdout/stderr after startup, in this supervised environment, both streams are being captured and can be utilized.\n\nOption C is not the best choice because it doesn't take advantage of the ability to separate different types of log messages that supervisord offers.\n\nOption D is incorrect in this context because the question specifies that the daemon processes are writing to stdout/stderr, which are then captured by the supervising process.

I'm not sure what `rsync`s actual algorithm is, but I believe that even if your `rsync` command wasn't trying to update the modification/access times that it'd probably have to start comparing blocks or checksums for blocks for everything that has a new modification time to see if it was actually changed or not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has copied files from an old disk array to a new one using the \"cp\" command without any specific options.

When files are copied using the \"cp\" command without the \"-p\" option, file metadata such as modification times, access times, and other attributes are not preserved. This change in metadata causes rsync to treat these files as potentially modified, even if the content hasn't changed. As a result, rsync begins comparing blocks or calculating checksums for all files with new modification times, leading to high CPU usage as it verifies the data integrity.

Instead, if you paint the whole wall, the fact that adjacent walls (around corners) don't match 100% is not noticeable. Keep this in mind when choosing where to cut (eg, choose smallest walls possible).\n* It may also be possible to get at the wire somewhere directly:\n\t+ If outlets cross doorways, there's a good chance the wire runs under the floor, and if it's an unfinished ceiling underneath, you can tap into the wire there.\n\t+ You might also be able to get at the wire in the wall, but this may be a bit of a guessing game. Non\\-contact circuit detectors (many stud finders have these) can help. Cut a small hole to inspect before cutting a bigger one to work in.\n\t+ You'll probably need two junctions to have enough slack. Keep in mind all j\\-boxes must be permanently accessible, so you may need to add an outlet or blank faceplate to make this work.\n\n---\n\nSmall variation is you could disconnect the outlets from the switch, and keep the circuit you drew for the switches/lights in place exactly as\\-is.

In tandem to this, each layer defines a part of the company hierarchy.\n\nE.g. A company decides on three layers. Layer one lists all tasks for a branch in the company, layer two defines the departments and layer 3 closes it off with tasks for employees. Additionally for each branch or department a user needs to be the designated manager, as to allow task creation in the first place.\n\nSo far our software had rudimentary access control in form of a simple flag based check whether the user can read, write, delete or manage Information for the entire account (where users of one company are seated). This is about to change as we now want users to be able to freely delete and write tasks that are assigned to them and to any department/branch/etc they are assigned to.\n\nNow that I am designing the corresponding system I asked myself whether a role based system (rigid Admin/Management/User) would be enough in the long term, as the actual control hinges on where the user is assigned to, not what actions he is allowed to take. Reading is always allowed (except for account data, this is reserved for admins), and a user designated as department\\-manager, will always have full control over its tasks.\n\nMy worry here is, if we decide to expand the program with another module (like project management or inventory forecasting) and then suddenly need finetuning, however my take would be to completely separate access control for these modules and decide what the best approach would be for either of those.\n\nI hope this was clear enough, and would humbly request tips, opinions or approaches. My gut tells me to go with the simple roles and maybe later implement a permission system for admins, if needed at all (the worst features are those never used), but I don't want to just forgo good software design.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like\n[capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)\nmay be a good match for your security model,\ngiven the flexibility with which a department manager\ncan delegate spending authority to folks working on a project.\n\nA downside to that is what it takes to revoke Alice's authority\nwhen things change later.

So, I'd put fat (2\"\\+) schedule 80 PVC in the ground now, using prefab wide radius sweeps for the horizontal to vertical transitions.\n\nFat aluminum is also your friend\n--------------------------------\n\nAll the bad things that you may have heard about aluminum building\\-wire *do not apply* to what you are doing right now. The terminations you're working with (pressure setscrew lugs) are much better at handling aluminum wire than the wrap\\-type terminal screws or backstabs on receptacles and switches, the aluminum wire that you buy now is made from a *different alloy* with better properties for building wiring than the aluminum wire that gave aluminum its bad rap, and the busbars and lugs *themselves* on your breakers and panels are likely made from plated aluminum, too.\n\nSo, that said, I'd use 2AWG, wet\\-location\\-rated (THWN or XHHW\\-2\\) aluminum wire for both hots and the neutral with an 8AWG or 6AWG (8AWG works, 6AWG might be more useful for grounding electrode conductors though) bare copper ground wire.

Conduit is relatively inexpensive compared to trenching costs\n\nThey also suggest using 2 AWG aluminum wire (THWN or XHHW-2 rated) for hot and neutral conductors, with a smaller copper ground wire. Aluminum is recommended for this application due to:\n1. Improved modern alloys\n2. Compatibility with lugs and busbars in panels\n3.

The software normally consists of server side software (a few microservices) and 1 or many client applications.\n\nThe deployed applications are usually a highly customised version of a general application. So we have a separate git repository for each install. \n\nI have been trying to improve the build and deployment cycle however I am struggling to find any best practices for this type of deployment. All the articles I read talk about continuous deployment, but all the related tools seem to be tailored to deploying to the cloud or our own servers. \n\nAt the moment we use team city as our build server. At some point we reach a point where the software will be released, so we force a build on the master branch and tag it accordingly. \n\nThe binaries are then copied to a dev or production server which the customer owns. And the configuration is done manually by us. Manually mainly means running scripts to setup config files, install services and setup databases. \n\nThe problem we are facing at the build and deploy process is very manual. Which means some times there are errors (forgot to run script, typos, missed copying some files) \n\nIs there anything we can do to improve it?\nBearing in mind we normally only have access to customers servers through some sort of Van connection and would not be able to deploy to their site without have change requests signed off etc. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To expand on Robert's answer,\n\nAutomation is definitely the correct approach. The following should provide a good starting point:\n\n* Ansible: this should be used to actually *provision* the server. If the Ansible tasks are written correctly, they can be idempotent (run multiple times with no worries), and will only update/change whatever needs to be changed. The typical way to use Ansible is to run it \"remotely\" using SSH, but I recommend using Ansible in \"local\" mode (explained below).\n* Shell scripts: if anything specific/complex needs to occur on boot, or at the end of the Ansible run, it's best to move it to a shell script which can be called separately. When writing shell scripts, ensure they are POSIX compliant and don't contain too much crazy logic, this way they can run safely on various operating systems, and won't be too difficult to debug down the line.\n* Pull, not push: since your customers need to download binaries, you can host them on a local/private HTTPS server, and have your Ansible scripts \"pull\" (download) the binaries. You can even add an sha256 hash in your Ansible YAML config files to verify the integrity of the downloads. Of course development will be a bit slower if you always need to update the hash in the config files, but if you don't change the binaries too often (ex: once a month), it's an acceptable approach.\n* Virtual machines: if you setup a virtual machine, you can test your Ansible and shell scripts on there without affecting your customer's servers. This allows you to catch errors and avoid destroying a production server.\n\nMy approach is the following:\n\n* Ensure the server has Git and Ansible installed.\n* Ensure the server has an SSH private key to git pull from either GitHub or a private git\\+ssh server.\n* SSH into the server, and perform a `git pull`, then `ansible-playbook -c local`\n\nAnsible in \"local\" mode requires your server to have Ansible installed, but it has the advantage that provisioning is much faster, and doesn't require a network connection (except for the initial git pull).\n\nThis method allows your customers to manually decide when a server gets updated, and allows you/them to verify code pushed to the Git repo, before running Ansible on the server. If you're using GitHub to keep track of your Ansible scripts, then you can create a bot account for pulling the repo changes (allowed as per GitHub's ToS), or use your server's public SSH key as a deploy key.\n\nI've listed a few other best practices for building software for on\\-premises, which you can read about [here](http://blog.unscramble.co.jp/post/155653778918/best-practices-for-building-on-prem-appliances) for additional tips."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company is looking to improve their build and deployment process for on-premise enterprise customers.

Ansible provides automation for server provisioning, reducing manual errors. Shell scripts can handle complex or specific tasks that may be required during deployment. The pull-based approach for binary distribution allows customers to control when updates occur and complies with their security requirements.

Is this correct?\n\nAs I got an answer to this question and I thought maybe my question is vague I will try to clarify it a bit more:\n\nFrom what I know by reading for a week the whole time about Monte Carlo method and MCMC, I understood(correct me if I am wrong) that:\n$$p(\\\\theta\\|y)\\=\\\\frac{p(y\\|\\\\theta)p(\\\\theta)}{\\\\int\\_{\\\\Theta}{p(y\\|\\\\theta)p(\\\\theta)}\\\\text{d}\\\\theta}.$$\n\nNow if you consider that we only have a sampling algorithm for $\\\\theta$ and we can only calculate $p(y\\|\\\\theta)$ explicitly(and not the other functions!), therefore to get values from $p(\\\\theta\\|y)$ one needs to numerically integrate the denominator. And for each value of this posterior one needs to apply a sampling scheme like Gibbs sampling to generate a sample of $p(\\\\theta\\|y)$; each new transition in the parameter space should then sample from the distribution which is $p(\\\\theta\\|y)$ here and to calculate that the above proportion should be computed. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We don't use MCMC to calculate the $p(\\\\theta \\| y)$ for each value (or many values) of $\\\\theta$. What MCMC (or the special case of Gibbs sampling) does is generate a (large) random sample from $p(\\\\theta \\| y)$. Note that $p(\\\\theta \\| y)$ is not being calculated; you have to do something with that vector (or matrix) of random numbers to estimate $p(\\\\theta)$. Since you're not calculating $p(\\\\theta)$ for lots of values of $\\\\theta$, you don't need a Gibbs (or MCMC) loop inside a $\\\\theta$ loop \\- just one (long) Gibbs (or MCMC) loop.\n\nEDIT in response to an update to the question: We do not need to integrate the distribution to get the constant of integration (CoI)! The whole value of MCMC is is found in situations where we can't calculate the CoI. Using MCMC, we can still generate random numbers from the distribution. If we could calculate the CoI, we could just calculate the probabilities directly, without the need to resort to simulation.\n\nOnce again, we are NOT calculating $p(\\\\theta\\|y)$ using MCMC, we are generating random numbers from $p(\\\\theta\\|y)$ using MCMC. A very different thing.\n\nHere's an example from a simple case: the posterior distribution for the scale parameter from an Exponential distribution with a uniform prior. The data is in `x`, and we generate `N <- 10000` samples from the posterior distribution. Observe that we are only calculating $p(x\\|\\\\theta)$ in the program.\n\n```r\nx <- rexp(100)\n\nN <- 10000\ntheta <- rep(0,N)\ntheta[1] <- cur_theta <- 1  # Starting value\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n   prop_theta <- runif(1,0,5)  # \"Independence\" sampler\n   alpha <- exp(sum(dexp(x,prop_theta,log=TRUE)) - sum(dexp(x,cur_theta,log=TRUE)))\n   if (runif(1) < alpha) cur_theta <- prop_theta\n   theta[i] <- cur_theta\n}\n\nhist(theta)\n\n```\n\nAnd the histogram:\n\n![Posterior distribution of $\\theta$](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZNFl.png)\n\nNote that the logic is simplified by our choice of sampler (the `prop_theta` line), as a couple of other terms in the next line (`alpha <- ...`) cancel out, so don't need to be calculated at all. It's also simplified by our choice of a uniform prior. Obviously we can improve this code a lot, but this is for expository rather than functional purposes.\n\nHere's a [link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5885/mcmc-method-good-sources) to a question with several answers giving sources for learning more about MCMC."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is using MCMC to analyze the posterior distribution of a parameter \u03b8 given data y, denoted as p(\u03b8|y). Which of the following statements is correct about this process?\n\nA) The researcher needs to calculate p(\u03b8|y) for each value of \u03b8 using Monte Carlo integration before running the MCMC algorithm.\n\nB) MCMC directly calculates the values of p(\u03b8|y) for different \u03b8 values, requiring nested loops - one for \u03b8 values and one for the MCMC iterations.\n\nC) MCMC generates samples from p(\u03b8|y) without explicitly calculating its values, and does not require calculation of the normalizing constant in the posterior.\n\nD) To use MCMC, the researcher must first analytically solve for the normalizing constant in Bayes' theorem before generating samples.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) methods, including Gibbs sampling, are designed to generate samples from a probability distribution without explicitly calculating the distribution's values. This is particularly useful for Bayesian inference where the posterior distribution p(\u03b8|y) is often known only up to a normalizing constant.\n\nA is incorrect because MCMC does not require pre-calculation of p(\u03b8|y) for each \u03b8 value. The method works by proposing and accepting/rejecting new values based on ratios of unnormalized posterior probabilities.\n\nB is wrong as MCMC doesn't calculate p(\u03b8|y) directly, and doesn't require nested loops for different \u03b8 values. It generates a chain of \u03b8 values that, after convergence, are samples from the posterior.\n\nD is incorrect because one of the main advantages of MCMC is that it doesn't require analytical calculation of the normalizing constant (often intractable in complex models).\n\nC correctly describes the MCMC process: it generates samples from the posterior without explicitly calculating p(\u03b8|y) values and without needing to compute the normalizing constant in Bayes' theorem."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/12", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3919528", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/127059/"], "docs_id": 3919528, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I currently have the following script as post build on a project:\n\n```\nif $(ConfigurationName) == \"Debug (x64)\" || $(ConfigurationName) == \"Release (x64)\" (goto :x64)\nif $(ConfigurationName) == \"Debug\" || $(ConfigurationName) == \"Release\" (goto :x86)\n\n:x64\ncopy \"$(SolutionDir)References\\x64\\System.Data.SQLite.dll\" \"$(TargetDir)System.Data.SQLite.dll\"\ngoto :default\n\n:x86\ncopy \"$(SolutionDir)References\\System.Data.SQLite.dll\" \"$(TargetDir)System.Data.SQLite.dll\"\ngoto :default\n\n:default\ncopy \"$(SolutionDir)References\\System.Data.SQLite.Linq.dll\" \"$(TargetDir)System.Data.SQLite.Linq.dll\"\n\n```\n\n(it copies the x86 or x64 version of the assembly to the output folder according to the Configuration)\n\nThis script returns error level 255, and as I have no idea of batch scripting, could somebody point me to the error?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I know, the `IF` in batch files does not support C like syntax of ORing together multiple expressions.\n\nSo as a first try, change these first lines of your script from:\n\n```\nif $(ConfigurationName) == \"Debug (x64)\" || $(ConfigurationName) == \"Release (x64)\" (goto :x64)\nif $(ConfigurationName) == \"Debug\" || $(ConfigurationName) == \"Release\" (goto :x86)\n\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\nif \"$(ConfigurationName)\"==\"Debug (x64)\" goto :x64\nif \"$(ConfigurationName)\"==\"Release (x64)\" goto :x64\nif \"$(ConfigurationName)\"==\"Debug\" goto :x86\nif \"$(ConfigurationName)\"==\"Release\" goto :x86\n\n```\n\nAlso note the added `\"` around the `$(ConfigurationName)`.  \n\nThe rest should work fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a post-build script for a Visual Studio project, you need to copy different versions of a DLL based on the configuration.

It won't work because those two modules are recursively dependent on each other so I won't be able to instantiate either of them.\n\nI think it is debatable if a `FileSystem` module really needs logging at its core, or if this concern should be solved on a different level, like suggested by Ben Cotrell, but anyway, let us assume your requirement is justified for some reason.\n\nLogs of `FileSystem` calls should be written to a **different file** than the log file used by, for example, an application which instantiates a file logger for a different purpose. So there should be two `FileLogger` objects in this scenario, each one associated with a different *file*. And since each of your `FileSystem` objects holds a reference to a specific file logger, this leads to the need of having **two different file system objects as well**, where the first one is initialized with a null logger and the second one with the logger for file system calls. In pseudo code:\n\n```\n FileSystem nonLoggingFileSystem = new FileSystem(new NullLogger());\n\n FileLogger fileSysCallsLogger(\"file_system_calls.log\", nonLoggingFileSystem);\n\n FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem(fileSysCallsLogger);\n\n FileLogger applicationCallsLogger(`application_calls.log`, fileSystem);\n\n```\n\nNow there is no cyclic dependency between the involved objects, and `fileSystem` as well as `applicationCallsLogger` can be used safely inside the application, without any recursion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a system with a FileSystem module that uses a Logger, and a FileLogger that needs to use the FileSystem, how can you resolve the cyclic dependency while still allowing the FileSystem to log its actions?\n\nA) Create a single FileLogger object and pass it to both the FileSystem and the application, using the same log file for all operations.\n\nB) Use a NullLogger for all FileSystem operations, sacrificing the ability to log file system actions.\n\nC) Create two separate FileSystem objects: one with a NullLogger for the FileLogger to use, and another with a FileLogger for the application to use.\n\nD) Implement a delayed initialization technique where the FileLogger starts with a NullLogger and switches to a real FileSystem after both objects are created.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct solution because it breaks the cyclic dependency while still allowing both the FileSystem and the application to log their actions. By creating two separate FileSystem objects - one with a NullLogger for the FileLogger to use, and another with the FileLogger for the application - we avoid the recursive dependency problem. This approach allows the FileSystem to log its actions (using the second FileSystem instance) while the FileLogger can still write to files without causing a dependency loop (using the first FileSystem instance with the NullLogger).\n\nOption A would not solve the cyclic dependency and could lead to infinite recursion.

The documentation suggests that the number of desktops itself doesn't significantly impact performance due to optimized routines and well-designed data structures in the window management system.
