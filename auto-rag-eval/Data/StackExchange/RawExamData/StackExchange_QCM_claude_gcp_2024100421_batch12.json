It was very useful to use \"fool's covering spaces\" of a space $X$, defined as\nfunctors $\\\\Pi\\_1(X)\\\\to Sets$, where $\\\\Pi\\_1(X)$ is the fundamental groupoids of $X$. In a more \"covering space way\", a fool's covering space can be described as a set $Y$, a map $p:Y\\\\to X$, and a map $p^{\\-1}(x\\_1\\)\\\\to p^{\\-1}(x\\_2\\)$ for any path between $x\\_1, x\\_2\\\\in X$, satisfying the obvious properties.\n\nIs there a standard name for \"fool's covering spaces\"? Calling them \"functors $\\\\Pi\\_1(X)\\\\to Sets$ \" is a bit heavy for the class.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Fool's covering spaces\" are very close to *overlays* of R. H. Fox (see [this](http://www.springerlink.com/content/hk52316r65043102/) paper in the first place and also [this one](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm74/fm7416.pdf)), which I think are still better: they retain all nice properties of \"fool's covering spaces\" and have additional ones. An equivalent (see [\"Steenrod homotopy\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1407), Lemma 7\\.3 or [Mardesic\\-Matijevic](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0166-8641(00)00012-2)) definition of an overlay is that it is\n\n> a covering that is induced from some covering over a polyhedron (or equivalently from some covering over a locally connected semi\\-locally simply\\-connected space).\n\nFox's original (equivalent) definition is that it is\n\n> a map $p:Y\\\\to X$ such that there exists a cover $\\\\{U\\_\\\\alpha\\\\}$ of $X$ satisfying\n> \n> \n> (i) each $p^{\\-1}(U\\_\\\\alpha)\\=\\\\bigsqcup\\_\\\\lambda U\\_\\\\alpha^\\\\lambda$, where each $p$ restricted over $U\\_\\\\alpha^\\\\lambda$ is a homeomorphism onto $U\\_\\\\alpha$; and\n> \n> \n> (ii) if $U\\_\\\\alpha^\\\\lambda\\\\cap U\\_\\\\beta^\\\\mu$ and $U\\_\\\\alpha^\\\\lambda\\\\cap U\\_\\\\beta^\\\\nu$ are both nonempty, then $\\\\mu\\=\\\\nu$.\n\nCondition (i) of course amounts to a definition of a covering in the usual sense.\n\nA third definition of overlays is by their monodromy. $d$\\-Sheeted overlays over a connected base $X$ (possibly $d\\=\\\\infty$) are identified with\n\n> the homotopy set $\\[X,BS\\_d]$.\n\nThis is essentially the monodromy classification theorem of Fox; for a shorter proof and the above formulation see \"Steenrod homotopy\", Theorem 7\\.4\\. Another reformulation:\noverlays are\n\n> functors $pro$\\-$\\\\Pi\\_1(X)\\\\to Sets$, where $pro$\\-$\\\\Pi\\_1$ is the fundamental pro\\-groupoid.\n\nThis is due to [Hernandez\\-Paricio](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm156/fm15611.pdf) (but note that his claim that Fox did his theory only for finite\\-sheeted overlays is not only incorrect but misleading; in fact, for finite\\-sheeted ones Fox shows that they reduce to coverings). I'm not fully happy with the pro\\-groupoid definition because a pro\\-groupid is a whole diagram of groupoids. I would prefer something like \"overlays are functors $\\\\Pi\\_1\\\\to Sets$, where $\\\\Pi\\_1$ is the topologized Steenrod fundamental groupoid (which combines Steenrod $\\\\pi\\_0$ and Steenrod $\\\\pi\\_1$)\"\nSuch formulation is possible, at least, in a special case (see Corollary 7\\.5\\. in \"Steenrod homotopy\").\nOver a base that is compact and Steenrod\\-connected (aka \"pointed 1\\-movable\"; in particular, this includes compact spaces that are connected and locally connected), overlays are\nidentified with functors $\\\\check\\\\pi\\_1(X)\\\\to Sets$, where $\\\\check\\\\pi\\_1$ is the topologized Cech (or Steenrod) fundamental group.\nNote that $\\\\check\\\\pi\\_1(X)\\=\\\\pi\\_1(X)$ if $X$ is locally connected and semi\\-locally simply\\-connected.\n\nFinally, I should mention that over a compact (metric) base, overlays can also be defined\n(Theorem 7\\.6 in \"Steenrod homotopy\") as\n\n> coverings in the category of uniform spaces.\n\nSuch uniform coverings have been studied by I. M. James in his book \"Introduction to Uniform spaces\"; see [Brodsky\\-Dydak\\-Labuz\\-Mitra](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3937) for a clarification of James' definition (the latter paper also has some relevant followups). This is really saying that overlays are precisely those coverings for which a metric on the base can be \"lifted\" to a metric in the total space. (Note that the compact base has a unique uniformity: as everyone might remember, every continuous function on a compact space is uniformly continuous.)\n\nDISCLAIMER: Following Fox, I have been assuming all spaces to be metrizable :) It is known\nthat this is not a real restriction, and everything extends to arbitrary spaces, perhaps with minor modifications (see Mardesic\\-Matijevic's paper, which also has many additional references about overlays; also the papers by Dydak\\-et\\-al. and Hernandez\\-Paricio may be relevant to this point) However, I prefer being ignorant of the non\\-metrizable world and so don't follow these modifications or whether they are needed.\n\nSUMMARY: For purposes of proving something about coverings of locally connected semi\\-locally simply\\-connected spaces usual covering work fine. For purposes of proving anything in topology beyond these restrictions, you would definitely need overlays, rather than \"fool's covering spaces\". But admittedly overlays are slightly harder to define. Thus for purposes of defining a formal concept which agrees with coverings for \"nice\" spaces and is not intended to be used for proving anything beyond \"nice\" spaces, \"fool's covering spaces\"\nsuit well; I would call them e.g. *path\\-overlays*.\n\nBy the way, I like the idea about the Seifert\\-van Kampen theorem; I think if combined with overlays, it should give a Seifert\\-van Kampen theorem in Steenrod homotopy, which would be an interesting result."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the relationship between \"fool's covering spaces\" and overlays as defined by R.H.

They also have applications beyond the restrictions of traditional covering spaces, making them more general and powerful than fool's covering spaces.

Most of the time one of the following happens:\n\n* I self\\-report a body and lose because it's obvious who was with the body\n* I run away from the body and someone reports it and lose because I'm running away from it\n* I am caught venting and voted out\n\nSometimes, I am lucky and get away with it, but it's pretty unique that it will happen. Is it me, or are these strategies bad? If they are bad, what's a good straightforward useful strategy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most of your problems are related to people discovering the body. Social tactics are another core part of playing impostor but that\u2019s so broad I can\u2019t address it here.\n\nThe easiest step you could take to reduce the frequency the corpses you make are discovered is to use your tools of sabotage. As an impostor you have a variety of abilities that allow you to disrupt the game and restructure the priorities of the crewmates.\n\nThe simplest and one of the most effective tactics is to wait until you are alone with a crewmate, sabotage a crisis on the opposite side of the ship, and immediately kill the solo crewmate. The crisis will draw other crewmates to fix it, which brings them away from the body, allowing you to slip away and have plausible deniability. The best part? If the crewmates ignore the crisis and let the timer reach zero then. you win!\n\nThe second critical sabotage you can create is to kill the lights. This reduces the crewmate\u2019s vision to about what is an arm\u2019s reach away, anything outside of that length is obscured. While the lights are off you, as an impostor, retain full perception and can seek out and kill with a high level of impunity. Even in a crowded room you can still kill unseen if the lights are out.\n\nThe last sabotage you can inflict is locking doors to a hallway. This is still a powerful tool if used properly. The core use of locking a door is to briefly keep people out of a room, or to purposefully lock people in a room. Locking others out of a room allows you to kill and vent away while guaranteeing there are no witnesses. Likewise, trapping somebody in a room may give you enough time to finish your kill cool down and strike again before your quarry is able to escape. Both forms of door sabotage are situational, but in the right situations they can be used to great effect.\n\nThere are an endless supply of tips to maximize your killing potential when playing as impostor \\- but the best teacher is practice. As you play more rounds of Among Us you\u2019ll learn through trial and error what tactics work best and what tactics get you caught. It\u2019s not fun to be caught now but as you play more sessions your skill level will increase and you will become more lethal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Among Us gameplay information:\n\nQuestion: As an Impostor in Among Us, which combination of strategies is most likely to help you avoid detection after killing a crewmate?\n\nA) Self-reporting the body immediately and sabotaging lights right after\nB) Sabotaging a crisis on the opposite side of the ship before killing, then locking the doors to the crime scene\nC) Venting away from the body and sabotaging oxygen to distract crewmates\nD) Killing in a crowded room with lights on and then running away from the body\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B combines multiple effective strategies mentioned in the text:\n\n1. Sabotaging a crisis on the opposite side of the ship draws crewmates away from your location, giving you an opportunity to kill without witnesses.\n2. Killing when alone with a crewmate reduces the chance of immediate discovery.\n3. Locking the doors to the crime scene after the kill prevents other crewmates from quickly finding the body, giving you time to establish an alibi.\n\nOption A is incorrect because self-reporting immediately is often suspicious, and sabotaging lights after reporting doesn't help conceal the kill.\n\nOption C is partially correct (venting away can be useful), but sabotaging oxygen isn't specifically mentioned as a superior tactic compared to other types of sabotage.\n\nOption D is a poor strategy as it involves killing in front of potential witnesses and then behaving suspiciously by running away from the body."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/180472", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/71659/"], "docs_id": 180472, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Just as *shortchange* means cheating someone by giving insufficient money as change, the word I am looking for means *cheating through counterfeit money*. \n\nThere are words as simple as *deceive*, *bilk*, *swindle*, *cozen* and others, but I couldn't find a word that means exactly what I need.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> [*To **shove***](http://www.socialvocabulary.com/defines/shove.html) \\[[**the queer**](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JRuNMHNcu5cC&pg=PA4788&lpg=PA4788&dq=slang%20%22shove%20the%20queer%22%20%22pass%20counterfeit%20money%22&source=bl&ots=6iCNPNNIkk&sig=QmLY0BwQCIZotb44RpXcQfV_wvE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EM2oU7uOC4jPOfCdgdAK&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=slang%20%22shove%20the%20queer%22%20%22pass%20counterfeit%20money%22&f=false)] *\\- verb 4\\.

I was at a talk and the speaker said that the mean function is usually quite uninteresting and all the inference effort is spent on estimating the correct covariance function. \n\nCan someone explain to me why that should be the case? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think I know what the speaker was getting at. Personally I don't completely agree with her/him, and there's a lot of people who don't. But to be fair, there are also many who do :) First of all, note that specifying the covariance function (kernel) implies specifying a prior distribution over functions. Just by changing the kernel, the realizations of the Gaussian Process change drastically, from the very smooth, infinitely differentiable, functions generated by the Squared Exponential kernel\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6RtP.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6RtP.png)\n\nto the \"spiky\", nondifferentiable functions corresponding to an Exponential kernel (or Matern kernel with $\\\\nu\\=1/2$)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPswd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPswd.png)\n\nAnother way to see it is to write the predictive mean (the mean of the Gaussian Process predictions, obtained by conditioning the GP on the training points) in a test point $x^\\*$, in the simplest case of a zero mean function:\n\n$$y^\\*\\=\\\\mathbf{k}^{\\*T}(K\\+\\\\sigma^{2}I)^{\\-1}\\\\mathbf{y}$$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{k}^\\*$ is the vector of covariances between the test point $x^\\*$ and the training points $x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n$, $K$ is the covariance matrix of the training points, $\\\\sigma$ is the noise term (just set $\\\\sigma\\=0$ if your lecture concerned noise\\-free predictions, i.e., Gaussian Process interpolation), and $\\\\mathbf{y}\\=(y\\_1,\\\\ldots,y\\_n)$ is the vector of observations in the training set. As you can see, even if the mean of the GP prior is zero, the predictive mean is not zero at all, and depending on the kernel and on the number of training points, it can be a very flexible model, able to learn extremely complex patterns.\n\nMore generally, it's the kernel which defines the generalization properties of the GP. Some kernels have the [universal approximation property](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/micchelli06a/micchelli06a.pdf), i.e., they are in principle capable to approximate any continuous function on a compact subset, to any prespecified maximum tolerance, given enough training points.\n\nThen, why should you care at all about the mean function? First of all, a simple mean function (a linear or orthogonal polynomial one) makes the model much more interpretable, and this advantage must not be underestimated for model as flexible (thus, complicated) as the GP. Secondly, in some way the zero mean (or, for what's worth, also the constant mean) GP kind of sucks at prediction far away from the training data. Many stationary kernels (except the periodic kernels) are such that $k(x\\_i\\-x^\\*) \\\\to 0 $ for $\\\\operatorname{dist}(x\\_i,x^\\*)\\\\to\\\\infty$. This convergence to 0 can happen surprisingly quickly, expecially with the Squared Exponential kernel, and particularly when a short correlation length is necessary to fit the training set well. Thus a GP with zero mean function will invariably predict $y^\\*\\\\approx 0$ as soon as you get away from the training set. \n\nNow, this could make sense in your application: after all, it is often a bad idea to use a data\\-driven model to perform predictions away from the set of data points used to train the model. See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/219579/what-is-wrong-with-extrapolation) for many interesting and fun examples of why this can be a bad idea. In this respect, the zero mean GP, which always converges to 0 away from the training set, is safer than a model (such as for example an high degree multivariate orthogonal polynomial model), which will happily shoot out insanely large predictions as soon as you get away from the training data. \n\nIn other cases, however, you may want your model to have a certain asympotic behavior, which is not to converge to a constant. Maybe physical consideration tell you that for $x^\\*$ sufficiently large, your model must become linear. In that case you want a linear mean function. In general, when the global properties of the model are of interest for your application, then you have to pay attention to the choice of the mean function. When you are interested only in the local (close to the training points) behavior of your model, then a zero or constant mean GP may be more than enough."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Gaussian Process (GP) modeling, why is the covariance function (kernel) often considered more important than the mean function for inference?\n\nA) The mean function is always set to zero and cannot be modified.\nB) The covariance function determines the shape and smoothness of the GP realizations, while the mean function has no impact on the model's flexibility.\nC) The covariance function defines the prior distribution over functions and largely determines the GP's generalization properties, while the mean function mainly affects interpretability and extrapolation behavior.\nD) The covariance function is easier to estimate than the mean function, so researchers focus on it for computational efficiency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the covariance function (kernel) plays a crucial role in determining the GP's behavior and generalization capabilities. It defines the prior distribution over functions and can dramatically change the nature of the GP realizations (e.g., from smooth to spiky). The kernel also largely determines the model's flexibility and ability to learn complex patterns from data.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean the mean function is entirely unimportant. As the explanation notes, the mean function can enhance interpretability and affect the model's behavior in extrapolation scenarios. A well-chosen mean function can incorporate prior knowledge about the global behavior of the system being modeled.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mean function can be set to various forms, not just zero. Option B is wrong because while the covariance function is indeed crucial for the model's flexibility, the mean function does have an impact, especially in areas far from training data. Option D is incorrect because the focus on the covariance function is not primarily due to computational reasons, but rather its fundamental role in shaping the GP's properties."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/12/06", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/239556", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/144626/"], "docs_id": 239556, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have now noticed a crack running along the length of the living room ceiling.  \n\nLooking to see who I need to come and look and fix it for me, so what trade, ie builder or joiner?\n\n[![Long crack in ceiling](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEzqil.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEzqi.jpg)\n\nClick for full size\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *From comments:* These are all UK terms.

The presence of a visible nail and tension in the joint indicates potential structural issues rather than just surface-level problems. The recommendation is to contact a general builder (known as a contractor in the US) who can investigate the underlying cause, particularly the joist movement, and also handle any necessary plasterwork and joinery. This professional would be best equipped to assess the situation comprehensively, especially given the concern about potential changes to the structure above (like a removed wall or chimney breast edge)."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/01", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/92825", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 92825, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is related to [this](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/92753/sums-of-powers-mod-p)  question. \n\n **Question.**  Suppose that $p$ is a prime, $p\\-1$ is divisible by $q^2$ for some $q$. Is it true that every number modulo $p$ is a sum of two $q$\\-th powers. \n\nIf $q\\=2$, then (\\*) is true. Indeed in that case $p\\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4$. Take any number $t \\\\mod p$. WLOG we can assume that $t$ is odd (the product of two sums of two squares is a sum of two squares). If $t\\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4$, then consider the arithmetic progression $4np\\+t, n\\\\ge 0$. By Dirichlet, it contains a prime $p'\\\\equiv 1\\\\mod 4$. By Fermat, $p'$ is a sum of two squares, hence $t$ is a sum of two squares modulo $p$. If $p\\\\equiv \\-1 \\\\mod 4$, then consider the arithmetic progression $8np\\+t\\-2p, n\\\\ge 0$. By Dirichlet, it contains a prime number $p'$ of the form $4k\\+1$ (since $p\\\\equiv 1\\\\mod 4$) and we are done. \n\nThat question may be easier than the question cited above. Or it may be a known open problem. \n\n **Update**  Several simplifications of the argument for $q\\=2$ were proposed.

Moreover, for entries of type `@misc`, it doesn't process `editor` fields either. You need to change the name of the `url` field to `note`, and you need to change the `editor` field name to `author`. If you want the information contained in the `urldate` field to be shown in the formatted bib entry as well, be sure to make it part of the `note` field. And, copy the information in the `series` field (\"Issues Brief\") to the end of the `author` field.\n\nFor the `\\url` macro to work, you must load either the `url` package and/or the `hyperref` package. If you want the citation call\\-outs and any URL strings in the bibliography to be made into hyperlinks, you should definitely load the `hyperref` package. \n\nTwo additional comments. First, the `german` and `ngerman` packages are obsolete. *Don't load them.* Instead, load the `babel` package with the option `german` or `ngerman`; use the latter option if your document is supposed to adhere to post\\-1997 (1998?) spelling and hyphenation conventions. Second, don't manipulate the low\\-level `\\baselinestretch` parameter directly. Instead, load the `setspace` package and issue a suitable `\\setstretch` directive.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMHGs.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMHGs.png)\n\n```\n\\RequirePackage{filecontents} % just to make this answer self-contained\n\\begin{filecontents}{Literatur12.bib}\n@misc{InternationalUnionforConservationofNature.2017,\n  author = {{International Union for Conservation of Nature}},\n  year   = {2017},\n  title  = {Deforestation and Forest Degradation (Issues Brief)},\n  note   = {\\url{https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/deforestation-forest_degradation_issues_brief_final.pdf}, \n            zuletzt gepr\u00fcft am 07.07.2018},\n  urldate = {07.07.2018},\n  series = {Issues Brief}\n}\n\\end{filecontents}\n\n\\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}\n\\usepackage[left=4cm, right=3cm, vmargin=3cm]{geometry}\n\n%%\\usepackage{german} % 'german' package is obsolete\n\\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}\n\\addto\\extrasngerman{%\n  \\renewcommand{\\refname}{Literaturverzeichnis}}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} \n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n%%\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.5}  % don't modify this low-level parameter directly\n\\usepackage{setspace} % instead, use the 'setspace' package\n\\setstretch{1.5}\n\n\\usepackage[round,authoryear]{natbib}\n\\bibliographystyle{ecta}\n\n\\usepackage[hyphens]{url} % 'hyphens' option allows line breaks after \"-\" characters\n\\usepackage[colorlinks,allcolors=blue]{hyperref} % optional\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\cite{InternationalUnionforConservationofNature.2017}\n%\\section{Literaturverzeichnis} % not necessary\n\\bibliography{Literatur12}\n\\end{document}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the ecta bibliography style in LaTeX, which of the following modifications is necessary to properly display URL information for a @misc entry?\n\nA) Change the url field to hyperlink\nB) Rename the editor field to author and move the url field content to note\nC) Add the hyperref package without modifying the bib file\nD) Change the urldate field to accessdate\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The ecta bibliography style doesn't recognize the url, urldate, and series fields for @misc entries.

Scientists assume that most of space is flat because observations of distant galaxies and galaxy clusters appear undistorted, much like looking through a flat piece of glass. This is analogous to how we assume a large expanse of glass is flat when images seen through it are not distorted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because dark matter does not uniformly curve all of space. Its effects are localized.\n\nOption B, while partially true, does not directly address why we assume space is mostly flat. It focuses on the scale of dark matter effects rather than the observational evidence for flatness.\n\nOption D is incorrect because gravitational lensing effects are not seen everywhere in space. They are localized phenomena caused by concentrations of matter (including dark matter) that act like cosmic magnifying glasses, distorting the images of more distant objects only in specific regions.\n\nThe key point is that the vast majority of our observations show an undistorted universe, leading to the assumption of overall flatness, with dark matter causing localized curvature effects."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/01", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/134199", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/29101/"], "docs_id": 134199, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let me more specific here\n\n> For the last two decades, people's interest in their ancestor's family, cultural and living background have been increasing.\n\nThere are two questions.\n\nThe first question is about the correct usage of a phrase: **For the last two decades** is being used as a phrase.

Is it a problem with my application's design, and should I design it in a more TDD, service\\-oriented way that always listens on some socket? Or should I just give up on isolation, and do something like this:\n\n* Poll repository for changes\n* Pull from repository\n* Build docker image\n* Run docker image as container\n* Open SSH session into container\n* Run tests\n* Kill docker container\n\nSSH'ing into the container seems like an ugly solution to me, since it requires deep knowledge of the contents of the container, and thus break the isolation.\n\nI would love to hear SO's different approaches to this problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You may invert the logic by moving test runner to the docker image:\n\n1. Tests are run within the docker image, so they access the application like in any other context, and the presence of docker doesn't change anything.\n2. Aggregating test results is where connection becomes an issue. The actual technology used will depend on your current infrastructure. It may as well be a message queue, a custom API or a direct access to the database.\n3. Since it belongs to the process which runs inside a docker image to report the test results, and not to the central service to pull the results from the test runners, it means that again, the presence of docker image doesn't make any difference."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Dockerized continuous integration workflow, what is the recommended approach for running tests on a background service that only communicates with a database?\n\nA) SSH into the Docker container and run the tests manually\nB) Expose a socket in the application to allow external test execution\nC) Include the tests within the Docker image and run them inside the container\nD) Mount the test files as a volume and execute them from outside the container\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The best approach is to include the tests within the Docker image and run them inside the container. This method maintains the isolation provided by Docker while allowing the tests to access the application in its natural environment. It doesn't require breaking the container's isolation (like SSH would) or modifying the application's design to expose unnecessary sockets. The test results can then be reported back to the CI system through various means such as a message queue, custom API, or direct database access, depending on the existing infrastructure. This approach keeps the testing process consistent across different environments and preserves the benefits of containerization in the CI workflow."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/09", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/17988", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/7219/"], "docs_id": 17988, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I dont know if anyone else out there has noticed but the Helicopters in Bad Company 2: Vietnam are stupidly hard to shoot down.\n\nI consider myself quite a Veteran at the original Bad Company 2 where heli's weren't all that much of a problem with the tracer dart and rpg combo, but I am really struggling with them in Vietnam.\n\nCurrently I just chip away slowly with an LMG and hope they dont fly off the get healed. Is there something incredibly obvious that I am missing ? because its just plain ridicolous how much damage these things can do sometimes (even if the pilot isnt anything special).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In hands of a good pilot Huey is pretty much indestructible if it keeps healing after a few cycles (they could even heal it right in the air). If I jump into one I would be dead in 10 seconds, but I still remember one guy that was murdering our whole team for the whole game scoring \\>4k points (and taking down choppers is my highest priority).\n\nThe best you can do is to spot it as early as possible and hope that a few teammates start helping, single handed you can only be somewhat an annoyance to a good pilot forcing him to go for a repair after couple cycles. To take cycle strafing armored chopper down in one cycle you probably would need at least 3 people with LMGs.\n\nIf I am the only one who tries to take it down, then the safest strategy against a good pilot is to shoot only when the chopper is turned backwards to you, and then quickly move to a new position before the next cycle.

This approach maximizes damage potential while minimizing the risk of counterattack.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tracer dart and RPG combo, while effective in the original Bad Company 2, is not mentioned as a viable strategy in the Vietnam version.\n\nOption B is incorrect because continuously firing without regard for positioning would make the player an easy target for the helicopter.\n\nOption D is incorrect because skilled pilots can repair their helicopters in the air, making it unlikely for them to land for repairs.\n\nThe correct answer, C, aligns with the \"safest strategy\" described in the documentation for a single player trying to combat a skilled helicopter pilot."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/28", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/143098", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/45826/"], "docs_id": 143098, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am facing issue with Magento, module installation, same error showing like the beginning of Magento installation.\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n[![screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dimC1.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dimC1.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All you need to do is check your Magento 2 requirements:\n[CLick here to check](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/system-requirements-2.0-tech.html)\n\nAnd install all latest version extensions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is attempting to install a new module in Magento 2 but encounters an error similar to the one shown during the initial Magento installation.

It does not impose any specific slot population requirements.\nAdvanced Error Correction Code (ECC) mode extends SDDC from x4 DRAM based DIMMs to both x4 and x8 DRAMs. This protects against single DRAM chip failures during normal operation. The restriction is that memory modules must be identical in size, speed, and technology. Identical DIMMs are installed in matched pair. Since you can order a server from start with this type of module compliance, there's no problem using AECC instead of optimized.\n\nNote that both optimized and AECC modes will let the **full amount of memory** be usable.\n\nIf power is fine which it should be on a server, there is no actual reason for RAM modules to have problems, the probability of that is low.\n\nIf you want to make sure you don't have to open up the server in the low chance case of a memory failure, you may choose spare mode. In this mode, one rank per channel is reserved as a spare. If persistent correctable errors are detected on a rank, the data from this rank is copied to the spare rank, and the failed rank is disabled. The memory available to the operating system is reduced by one rank per channel.\n\nFor example, in a dual\\-processor configuration with 16x 4 GB single\\-rank memory modules, the available system memory is: **3/4** (ranks/channel) \u00d7 16 (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 48 GB, and not 16 1x (memory modules) \u00d7 4 GB \\= 64 GB.\n\nMirroring is like a RAID 1 for memory. The bad part is that in a mirrored configuration, the total available system memory is one half of the total installed physical memory, exactly like with HDDs in RAID 1\\. So if you really need maximum protection you an choose this one but in your case you will have only 192 GB (**half**) to work with.\n\nFault Resilient Memory (FRM) is an operating mode introduced in newer PowerEdge servers. The mode establishes an area of memory that is fault resilient and can be used by hypervisors such as VMware ESXi to load vmkernel, critical applications or services to maximize system availability. The operating systems uses the resilient region exposed from the platform and map the process\u2019s address ranges to enforce resiliency. This is good to be used for ESXi installations. FRM creates a highly resilient memory zone for the hypervisor, protecting it from severe memory errors. With the VMware Reliable Memory feature, vSphere 5\\.5 and later revisions can take advantage of this zone, providing the hypervisor with a strong protection from memory faults that would bring down the entire system."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A server administrator is configuring memory options for a new PowerEdge server.

The -XX:MaxPermSize=256m argument should be placed in the eclipse.ini file under the -vmargs section.\n\nOption A (-launcher.XXMaxPermSize=256m) is incorrect due to a bug in Eclipse Helios that prevents this syntax from working properly.\n\nOption C (-XX:PermSize=256m) sets the initial PermGen size, not the maximum size, and would not solve the OutOfMemoryError.\n\nOption D (-Xmx256m) increases the maximum heap size, not the PermGen size, and would not address the specific PermGen space error.\n\nThe correct configuration helps prevent PermGen space errors by allowing Eclipse to use more permanent generation memory, which is particularly important when working with large projects or multiple plugins."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/22", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/875023", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/13295/"], "docs_id": 875023, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been wondering if anyone knows if there is a generating function for harmonic series of the form $H\\_{2n}$?.\n\nThat is, we are familiar with $$\\-\\\\frac{\\\\log(1\\-x)}{1\\-x}\\=\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}H\\_{n}x^{n}$$\n\nBut, is there one for $$\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}H\\_{2n}x^{n}$$ that anyone knows of?.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is an ugly trick, but it works.

This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. QgsMapToolEmitPoint is specifically designed to emit a QgsPoint for each click on the map canvas, which is ideal for capturing user clicks.\n\n2. The canvasClicked signal provides the exact coordinates of the clicked point, making it easy to perform spatial queries to identify features at that location.\n\n3.

It integrates well with QGIS's existing infrastructure and provides a clean, maintainable way to implement click-based feature identification.\n\nWhile the other options (QgsMapToolIdentify, QgsMapCanvas, and QgsMapTool) are related to map interactions in QGIS, they are either less specific to the task at hand or require more complex implementations to achieve the same result as QgsMapToolEmitPoint with canvasClicked signal."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/14", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/42711", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/5916/"], "docs_id": 42711, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do I install Ubuntu as the only OS on a MacBook?\n\nThat is, I'd like to completely remove Mac OS X and install Ubuntu.

An inelastic collision is one in which part of the kinetic energy is changed to some other form of energy in the collision. Any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some of the kinetic energy into internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large scale impacts are perfectly elastic.\n\nThink of a ball bouncing off a wall. The velocity of the wall due to the collision is very close to zero, momentum conservation is easy to achieve .\n\nYour \"box\\-photon collisions.\" fall into the framework of a macroscopic collision , because the box is a macroscopic object. Because of the large mass of the box the velocity of the box needed to achieve momentum conservation is practically zero, and within measurement errors, which means, even though the photon will lose some of its energy to the box, the energy change is so small that it cannot be measured.

In collisions with the box, photons may transfer a small amount of energy to the box, which would be observed as a change in the photon's frequency (due to E=h\u03bd), not a change in velocity.

What you're missing is that \"two\\-by\" lumber **is actually 1\\-1/2\" wide**.\n\n1\\-by is 3/4\" wide.  \n\nAnd manufacturers *don't* make products that require 2\" wide studs. That would imply some sort of pre\\-war construction using rough\\-sawn timbers.\n\nIn the early days, a 2x4 was *milled* 2\" x 4\". Then it was run through a *jointer* to make one side flat, then (using the jointed side) a *planer* to make the other side parallel to the first side, then more passes through the planer to make both sides smooth. Same thing in both axes. Early experience was that rough\\-cut lumber was irregular enough that 1/2\" of material would be used up in all this jointing and planing. So the target \"finished\" size was the finished timber was 1\\-1/2\" x 3\\-1/2\".\n\nContemporarily, mills have gotten better at their game, and are able to rough\\-saw the lumber more precisely, so they're not *really* wasting 1/2\" anymore."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In modern construction, what is the actual width of a standard \"two-by\" lumber, and why does this discrepancy exist between the nominal and actual size?\n\nA) 2 inches wide, because manufacturers still use pre-war construction standards\nB) 1-3/4 inches wide, due to the planing process removing 1/4 inch from each side\nC) 1-1/2 inches wide, as a result of historical milling and finishing processes\nD) 2 inches wide, but 1/2 inch is removed during installation for fitting purposes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Modern \"two-by\" lumber is actually 1-1/2 inches wide. This discrepancy between the nominal (2 inches) and actual (1-1/2 inches) size is a result of historical milling and finishing processes. In the past, rough-sawn 2-inch lumber would lose about 1/2 inch during the jointing and planing processes to achieve smooth, parallel sides. Although modern milling techniques are more precise and don't necessarily waste as much material, the 1-1/2 inch finished size has become the industry standard. Option A is incorrect because pre-war standards actually used true 2-inch lumber. Option B provides an incorrect measurement and reasoning.

Additionally, the actual performance benefit can only be determined through benchmarking under specific workloads. \n\nOption A is incorrect because 'noatime' is not universally beneficial and requires careful consideration before implementation. \n\nOption B is too absolute; while 'relatime' is a safe default, it can be changed if appropriate for the specific use case. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the choice between 'noatime' and 'relatime' can have a measurable impact, especially for workloads with a large volume of reads and writes to the same files, which is typical for database operations."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/09/22", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/163784", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/59586/"], "docs_id": 163784, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some points given in ECEF coordinates (or LatLongAltitude based on WGS84, which is interchangable in my understanding). Currently I am working on a mapping software which allows to visualize these points in maps. The current software version orthographically projects the points onto a plane, but future versions should support a wider range of map projections like Mercator and others. (It is not yet decided which exactly but the software design should be open to extension.)\n\nFrom what I have read so far, the usual process for creating maps is\n\n* project the 3D points onto the chosen reference ellipsoid which yields (2D) LatLong coordinates (in case of WGS84 ellipsoid, I could use my current LatLong and \"drop\" the altitude information)\n* transform the LatLong coordinates into map coordinates (depending on the chosen map projection)\n\nThis actually is different from what we are doing currently: By first projecting onto the reference ellipsoid, the altitude is \"lost\". If then the projected point is transformed (e.g. with an orthographic projection) to map coordinates, altitude has no effect. In contrast, if the 3d point is directly projected orthographically, \"altitude\" (wrt to any ellipsoid) has effect on the output coordinates.\n\nI tried to illustrate this (based on the height definition in @Farid Cher's answer):\n\n[![1-step vs 2-step projection](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eim0h.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eim0h.png)\nWhen Point P0 is directly projected (as in our case) it becomes P0p on the Projection plane, whereas by first projecting onto the ellipsoid (to P1\\) and then projecting on the Projection plane, it becomes P1p (which is not P0p).\n\nMy questions are these:\n\n1\\.) Is there any (practically relevant) map projection which follows the approach that we have currently implemented or do they \"all\" adhere to the two step process described earlier? (I.e., does the Altitude have an influence on the map coordinates?)\n\n2\\.) Is it safe to assume that all points with the same LatLong coordinates (wrt any practically used reference ellipsoid) are on a straight line? (I know that depending on the choice of geodetic or geocentric coordinates, these lines for different LatLong may have a common point or not, but that's not too important for me.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To address your second question, I can say, that depends on how you project earth topography on your ellipsoid (how the straight line is defined). The straight line can be rhumb\\-line, a line vertical to the ellipsoid surface or a line that passes through the ellipsoid center. If you define this line, then you can say any LatLong on this line are equal.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCDKc.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCDKc.jpg)\n\nSo any point (LatLong) on earth surface has an equivalent point on the ellipsoid (e.g. wgs84\\). It is not like simply dropping the z (altitude) from 3D coordinate. This is usually the intersection of rhumb\\-line with the mathematical ellipsoid surface. \n [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/plSBz.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/plSBz.gif)\nWhen you transform a geographic coordinate system (WGS84\\) to a projected coordinate system, It doesn't mean you are losing (dropping) the Z (earth topography). The LatLong already contains the altitude implicitly (intersection of rumb\\-line with ellipsoid). \n\nSo to answer your first question, all map projections are doing the same process like your orthographic projection. But you should know how the ellipsoid X,Y (Phi,Lambda) are inferred from the location on earth surface. There are many ellipsoids or spheroids that estimate the earth surface. Each of them has a well defined mapping, from the earth topography on the mathematical earth surface (ellipsoid or spheroid). \n\nI reccommend you to read esri online documentation about map projections:\n[Projection basics the GIS professional needs to know](http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=projection_basics_the_gis_professional_needs_to_know)\n\n**Update**\n\nIn your example you are trying to project a simple 3D point (X,Y,Z) to a 2D space (not a map projection). \n\nWhy do we use map projections at all?\nWith map projection we want to reach the 2D space from ellipsoidal (spherical) surface of the earth. It seems more complex than your simple projection. So we use approximation. For example with the popular TM (Transfer Mercator) projection, We fit a cylindrical shape to earth surface that the cylinder is longitudinal along the equator. Although with this specific projection, it may result in extreme stretching near poles.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lozoN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lozoN.png)\n\nImagine you are projecting each point on estimated earth e.g. ellipsoid (LatLong) to this cylinder (This part is like your process of orthogonal projection). visualize you have cut the earth to equal slices; Then open the sliced earth to cover the cylinder.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujUTa.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujUTa.jpg)\n\nThen suppose this cylinder is a paper and you cut the paper vertically. Now you have a 2D surface that contains all points from the complex 3D earth surface."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A GIS developer is creating software to visualize points on a map.

While many map projections do follow a two-step process of first projecting onto a reference ellipsoid and then applying a map projection, the exact process can vary. Some specialized projections or applications might handle altitude differently. The question highlights that the standard process often involves the two steps mentioned, but leaves room for variations based on specific projection types or use cases.

Wait at least 30\\+ seconds after the last change, *before* considering a write. When I futz with the volume, it is to mute advertising. Also I often increase volume to hear something specific, maybe a favourite track, then re\\-set volume quite close to where I started. If you haven't implemented a mute, it might be worth doing so. That is a common case for me, and might be a common case for you. You might significantly reduce the number of volume updates by ignoring mute, and leaving the saved volume unchanged.\n2. Don't write if the value is only a couple of % different. It is unlikely that your ears will tell the difference.\n\nIf the number of writes/day is still an issue, detect 'power down', and change the strategy to only saving when power is being removed. \n\nThe chip will need several milliseconds to ensure it can do the EEPROM write. \nThe best data I've found about EEPROM write time is \"Table 28\\-18, Typical Wait Delay Before Writing the Next Flash or EEPROM Location\" says the delay is \"3\\.6ms\". \n\nSo the local power supply to the ATmega will need a maintain an operating voltage for longer than that to ensure EEPROM is correctly written. That might be a bit awkward to do on an Arduino.

Which sheaves can we get as the pushforward of a locally free sheaf of rank 1? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Write $$ f\\_\\* \\\\mathcal{O}(m) \\= \\\\bigoplus\\_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} \\\\mathcal{O}(k)^{\\\\alpha(m, k)}. $$ We want to compute the multiplicities $\\\\alpha(m,k)$. We have $f^\\* \\\\mathcal{O}(k) \\= \\\\mathcal{O}(nk)$ where $n \\= \\\\deg f$, so the projection formula gives $$ (f\\_\\* \\\\mathcal{O}(m)) \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{O}(\\-k) \\= f\\_\\* \\\\mathcal{O}(m\\-nk),$$ \nand hence $\\\\alpha(m,k) \\= \\\\alpha(m\\-nk, 0\\)$. If $S(x) \\= \\\\sum\\_m (m\\+1\\)x^m \\= 1/(1\\-x)^2$ and $A(x) \\= \\\\alpha(m,0\\) x^m$, then applying $h^0(\\-)$ to both sides of the first displayed formula, multiplying by $x^m$ and summing over $m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}$ gives $$ S(x) \\= A(x)\\\\cdot S(x^n).$$\nThus \n$$ \\\\alpha(m,k) \\= \\\\left(\\\\text{coefficient of }x^{m\\-nk}\\\\text{ in } S(x)/S(x^n) \\= (1\\+x\\+\\\\cdots \\+ x^{n\\-1})^2\\\\right). $$\nFor example, $$f\\_\\* \\\\mathcal{O} \\= \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\oplus \\\\mathcal{O}(\\-1\\)^{n\\-1}.$$\n\n(The above argument appears in my paper \"Frobenius Push\\-Forwards on Quadrics\", and works similarly for $\\\\mathbb{P}^N$. The first place I know where these pushforwards are computed is the paper \"Frobenius direct images of line bundles on toric varieties\" by J. F.

It requires careful attention to the exact formula provided and an understanding of sheaf notation."}}
