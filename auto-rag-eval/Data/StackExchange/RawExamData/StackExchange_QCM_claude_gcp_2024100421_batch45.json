We have notions of psuedo\\-Riemannian or Riemannian metrics on a manifold, and they differ in the slightest way of being positive\\-definite or not. However, what happens if we drop positive\\-definite AND symmetry? For example, if we had a nondegenerate bilinear form $g\\_p: T\\_p M \\\\times T\\_p M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ that varied smoothly between points. Has this been explored in depth? It appears to me at surface level that one could still concoct connections, curvature, and possibly a notion of parallel transport in this flavor of 'smooth geometry'. A motivation for me to ask is as follows. Suppose $R$ is an $S$\\-algebra where $\\\\Omega\\_{R/S}$ is reflexive and the canonical isomorphism $\\\\phi: \\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\to \\\\Theta\\_{R/S}$ is an isomorphism of $R$\\-modules (i.e. nonsingular varieties). There exists a canonical map $\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\to R$, which is $R$\\-bilinear and nondegenerate, and is given by $\\\\langle \\\\omega, V \\\\rangle \\= l(\\\\omega)$ where $l:\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\to k$ such that $l \\\\circ d\\_{R/S} \\= V$. This induces a morphism $$\\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\phi^{\\-1} \\\\times 1}\\\\Omega\\_{R/S} \\\\times \\\\Theta\\_{R/S} \\\\to R.$$ Natural questions that arise are is this composition $R$\\-bilinear nondegenerate, and when is it symmetric? Which symmetric $R$\\-bilinear forms factor through $\\\\phi^{\\-1} \\\\times 1$? When we work with a manifold and have a metric tensor that is bilinear and nondegenerate, just how interesting is this flavor of curvature (whatever it is supposed to mean)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider a bilinear form $b \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}^\\\\infty (T^\\*M\\\\otimes T^\\*M, \\\\mathbb{R})$ and an affine connection $\\\\nabla \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{\\\\Gamma}^\\\\infty(TM) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{\\\\Gamma}^\\\\infty(T^\\*M\\\\otimes TM)$ whose parallel transport preserves $b$. That can be expressed by the condition $b(\\\\nabla\\_X Y, Z) \\+ b(Y, \\\\nabla\\_X Z) \\= 0$ for all $X, Y, Z \\\\in \\\\Gamma(TM).$\n\nWhen $b$ is symmetric nondegenerate tensor (i.e. a pseudo\\-Riemannian metric), then this $\\\\nabla$ is caleld metric connection. It always exists, but it is not unique! To get a unique connection one has to impose also that $\\\\nabla$ has zero torsion tensor. \n\nWhen $b$ is antisymmetric nondegenerate tensor (i.e. a presymplectic form), then $\\\\nabla$ is known as symplectic connection but this time the uniqueness is not saved by torsion\\-freeness. \n\nThe way to handle these problems in general is to consider one torsion free $b$\\-connection $\\\\nabla$ and study its modification $\\\\nabla \\+ A$ where $A \\\\in \\\\Gamma(\\\\mathrm{End}(TM)).$ Such modified connection preserves $b$ if and only if $b(A(X)Y, Z) \\+ b(Y, A(X)Z) \\= 0\\.$ Torsion\\-freeness is equivalent to $A(X)Y \\- A(Y)X \\= 0\\.$ From this it is obvious that the affine space of torsion\\-free $b$\\-connections is governed by the representation theory of Lie algebra of the isotropy group of $b$. Sometimes you get just the trivial representation, sometimes you get bigger space.\n\nThe punchline here is that connection preserving some tensorial objects are generally not unique. You can either add some additional data to fix them, or you can try to construct invariants which do not depend on the possible choices."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a smooth manifold M with a non-degenerate bilinear form b \u2208 C\u221e(T*M\u2297T*M, \u211d) that is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. Let \u2207 be an affine connection on M preserving b. Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) The connection \u2207 is always unique for a given b.\nB) Adding the condition of zero torsion tensor always guarantees uniqueness of \u2207.\nC) The space of b-preserving connections can be studied by considering modifications of the form \u2207 + A, where A \u2208 \u0393(End(TM)).\nD) The isotropy group of b plays no role in determining the affine space of b-preserving connections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When dealing with a general non-degenerate bilinear form b that is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric, the connection \u2207 preserving b is not necessarily unique, even with the additional condition of zero torsion.

Of all the careless lines of code recorded in the annals of computer science, this one may stand as the most devastatingly efficient. From interviews with rocketry experts and an analysis prepared for the space agency, a clear path from an arithmetic error to total destruction emerges.\n\nWhat major changes did Flight's 501 failure and the subsequent investigations inspire to the research of safety critical systems and software testing?\n\nI'm not looking for an explanation of the bug itself, but for an explanation of the historical impact of the bug, in terms of research that were inspired from or were directly related to the investigation(s) of the failure. For example this [paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1998ESASP.422..201L) concludes:\n\n> We have used static analysis to:\n> \n> \n> * check the initialization of variables,\n> * provide the exhaustive list of potential data access conflicts for shared variables,\n> * exhaustively list the potential run time errors from the Ada semantics.\n> \n> \n> **To our knowledge this is the first time boolean\\-based and non boolean\\-based static analysis techniques are used to validate industrial programs.**\n\nSimilarly, [this paper](http://spiderman-2.laas.fr/IFIPWG/Workshops&Meetings/40/5-Cousot.pdf)(pdf) notes:\n\n> Abstract interpretation based static program analyses have been used for the\n> static analysis of the embedded ADA software of the Ariane 5 launcher and\n> the ARD.

Still a quite expensive failure but nowhere near the $7 billion figure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically speaking, it was more a case of \"[software rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)\". The flight control software was recycled from the earlier Ariane 4 rocket, a sensible move given how expensive it is to develop software, especially when it's mission critical software which must be tested and verified to far more rigorous standards than most commercial software needs to be. \n\nUnfortunately, nobody bothered testing what effect the change in operating environment would have, or if they did they didn't do said testing to a sufficiently thorough standard. \n\nThe software was built to expect certain parameters to never exceed certain values (thrust, acceleration, fuel consumption rates, vibration levels, etc). In normal flight on an Ariane 4 this wasn't a problem because those parameters would never reach invalid values without something already being spectacularly wrong. The Ariane 5, however, is much more powerful and ranges that would seem to be silly on the 4 could quite easily happen on the 5\\. \n\nI'm not sure what parameter it was that went out of range (it might have been acceleration, I'll have to check), but when it did, the software was unable to cope and suffered an arithmetic overflow for which there had been insufficient error checking and recovery code implemented. The guidance computer started sending garbage to the engine nozzle gimbals, which in turn started pointing the engine nozzle pretty much randomly. The rocket started to tumble and break up, and the automatic self\\-destruct system detected the rocket was now in an unsafe irrecoverable attitude and finished the job. \n\nTo be honest, this incident probably didn't teach any new lessons, as the kind of problems have been unearthed before in all manner of systems, and there are already strategies in place to deal with finding and fixing errors. What the incident did do was ram home the point that being lax in following those strategies can have enormous consequences, in this case millions of dollars of destroyed hardware, some extremely pissed off customers and an ugly dent in the reputation of Arianespace. \n\nThis particular case was especially glaring because a shortcut taken to save money ended up costing a huge amount, both in terms of money and lost reputation. If the software had been tested just as robustly in an Ariane 5 simulated environment as it had been when it was originally developed for Ariane 4, the error surely would have come to light long before the software was installed in launch hardware and put in command of an actual flight. Additionally, if a software developer had deliberately thrown some nonsense input into the software then the error might have even been caught in the Ariane 4 era, as it would have highlighted the fact that the error recovery that was in place was inadequate.\n\nSo in short, it didn't really teach new lessons, but it rammed home the dangers of not remembering old ones. It also demonstrated that the environment within which a software system operates is every bit as important as the software itself. Just because the software is verifiably correct for environment X doesn't mean it's fit for purpose in the similar but distinct environment Y. Finally it highlighted how important it is for mission critical software to be robust enough to deal with circumstances that shouldn't have happened. \n\nContrast flight 501 with Apollo 11 and its computer problems. Whilst the LGC software suffered from a serious glitch during the landing, it was designed to be extremely robust and was able to remain in an operational state in spite of the software alarms that were triggered, without putting any astronauts in danger and still being able to complete its mission."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the impact of the Ariane 5 Flight 501 failure on software testing approaches?\n\nA) It introduced entirely new testing methodologies that had never been considered before in safety-critical systems.\n\nB) It demonstrated the importance of rigorous testing in simulated environments that accurately reflect new operational conditions, even for previously validated software.\n\nC) It proved that software testing is unnecessary for systems that have already been successfully deployed in similar environments.\n\nD) It showed that automated testing tools are always superior to manual testing methods for mission-critical software.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Ariane 5 Flight 501 failure didn't necessarily introduce new testing methodologies (A), but rather emphasized the importance of existing best practices.

For example, let's say I put a weight onto a piston at equilibrium. The force of gravity will now act on the system. Why is the force (gravity I think) of a piston slowly compressing an ideal gas not conservative? The \"potential energy\" of the weight should be being transferred into the gas molecules somehow because the internal energy (I think) of the system went up because we see that the pressure of the gas has gone up.\n\nDoes it matter if the process is reversible or irreversible?\n\nNote: Some of the potential energy also turned into kinetic energy of the weight as it moved. But perhaps we can assume that the weight moves so slowly that it gains an infinitesimal in kinetic energy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It does matter if the process is reversible or irreversible because reversible processes give maximum work. It can be verified by a PV diagram of a reversible process. These processes produce maximum work because the value of pressure is infinitesimally greater (in case of compression) than the pressure of the gas in the container. \n\nAs we know, $W\\_{ext}\\=\\-P\\_{ext}\\\\Delta V$, if Pressure was maximum for each infinitesimal change in volume then the work done (corresponding to that change) will also be maximum. This can only happen if the external pressure is infinitesimally greater than the pressure of the gas in the container and compression will take place very slowly.\n\nIn other words, the PV diagrams of reversible processes give maximum area under the PV curve and the volume axis.\n\nThese processes, ideally speaking, never reach completion and are very slow and obviously, cannot be realized in real life. A reversible process is a ideal process.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SephW.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SephW.jpg)\n\nWork done in path dependent. This can also be verified by the PV diagram. Take this diagram for example.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CP8I.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CP8I.png)\n\nThere are infinitely many paths that can be taken to move the system from state A to state B and each path will give a different value of work done.\n\nThe work done in path A\\-B is greater than the work done in path A\\-C\\-B. (Work done is give by the area under the PV curve and V axis).\n\nThe work done by the system in a cyclic transformation is equal to the heat absorbed by the system. Since $\\\\Delta U\\=0$, if the system work is done **by** the system $(\\\\Delta V\\=\\+ve)$ then the heat has to be absorbed by the system $(q\\=\\+ve)$ in order for $\\\\Delta U$ to be $0$.

(And of course in POTS there's no metadata at all.) 3GPP TS 24\\.008 might be a good place to start looking; it contains the formats of the actual radio packets that are sent and received to set up or tear down a voice call.\n\nI'm not familiar with the newer (4G, LTE, etc) interfaces and they might be able to carry more call metadata, but whether metadata sent by one handset will make it across the network to another handset, or whether any phones have APIs to send or receive that data, is another question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the transmission of custom data along with a phone call in cellular networks?\n\nA) Custom data can be easily added to call headers in all cellular network standards, and this functionality is widely available through APIs on most smartphones.\n\nB) The ability to send custom data with phone calls is strictly prohibited by cellular network standards and impossible to implement.\n\nC) In classic GSM/3G/UMTS systems, there is limited metadata beyond basic call information, but newer 4G/LTE systems might have more capabilities for custom data transmission.\n\nD) All cellular networks universally support the transmission of extensive custom data alongside voice calls, but this feature is restricted to privileged users for legal reasons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. The answer acknowledges that older cellular systems (GSM/3G/UMTS) have limited metadata capabilities, primarily including basic information like the dialed number, call type, and possibly some routing information.

That is, I'd like to `debootstrap` it myself or adjust the `lxc-ubuntu` template (commonly under `/usr/share/lxc/templates`) in order for this to work.\n\nHere's why I am asking this question. If you look at the `lxc-ubuntu` template, you'll notice:\n\n```bash\n# Detect use under userns (unsupported)\nfor arg in \"$@\"; do\n    [ \"$arg\" = \"--\" ] && break\n    if [ \"$arg\" = \"--mapped-uid\" -o \"$arg\" = \"--mapped-gid\" ]; then\n        echo \"This template can't be used for unprivileged containers.\" 1>&2\n        echo \"You may want to try the \\\"download\\\" template instead.\" 1>&2\n        exit 1\n    fi\ndone\n\n```\n\nFollowing the use of `LXC_MAPPED_GID` and `LXC_MAPPED_UID` in the referenced `lxc-download` template, though, there seems to be nothing particularly special. In fact all it does is to adjust the file ownership (`chgrp` \\+ `chown`). But it's possible that the extended attributes in the `download` template are fine\\-tuned already to accomplish whatever \"magic\" is needed.\n\nIn the comments to [this blog post by St\u00e9phane Graber](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/17/lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers/) St\u00e9phane tells a commenter that\n\n> There\u2019s no easy way to do that unfortunately, you\u2019d need to update\n>  your container config to match that from an unprivileged container,\n>  move the container\u2019s directory over to the unprivileged user you want\n>  it to run as, then use Serge\u2019s uidshift program to change the\n>  ownership of all files.\n\n... and to:\n\n* have a look at <https://jenkins.linuxcontainers.org/> for the packages built for the `download` template\n* check out `uidmapshift` from [here](https://launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/+archive/nsexec)\n\t+ This program appears to roughly do `lxc-usernsexec -m b:0:1000:1 -m b:1:190000:1 -- /bin/chown 1:1 $file` as explained in [`lxc-usernsexec(1)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lxc-usernsexec.1.html)\n\nBut there are no further pointers.\n\n**So my question is: how can I take an ordinary (privileged) LXC container that I have built myself (having `root` and all) and migrate it to become an unprivileged container?** Even if you can't provide a script or so, it would be great to know which points to consider and how they affect the ability to run the unprivileged LXC container. I can come up with a script on my own and pledge to post it as an answer to this question if a solution can be found :)\n\n*Note:* Although I am using Ubuntu 14\\.04, this is a *generic* question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was just doing something very similar, moving KVM VMs into unprivileged LXC.\n\nI was using system containers for this (so they can be started automatically on boot), but with mapped UID/GIDs (user namespaces).\n\n1. edit /etc/subuid,subgid (I mapped uid/gids 10M\\-100M to root and use 100K per container)\n2. for first container, use u/gids 10000000\\-10099999 in /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/config\n3. mount the container storage on /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs (or do nothing if you don't use separate volume/dataset/whatever per container)\n4. chown 10000000:10000000 /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs\n5. setfacl \\-m u:10000000:x /var/lib/lxc (or simply chmod o\\+x /var/lib/lxc)\n6. lxc\\-usernsexec \\-m b:0:10000000:100000 \\-\\- /bin/bash\n\nNow you're in the first container user namespace. Everything is the same, but your process thinks it's uid is 0, when in fact in the host namespace it's uid 10000000\\. Check /proc/self/uid\\_map to see whether your uid is mapped or not. You will notice you can no longer read from /root and it seems to be owned by nobody/nogroup.\n\nWhile in the user namespace, I rsync from the original host.\n\nOutside the user namespace, you will see that the files in /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs are now owned not by the expected (same) uids as the origin installation, but rather 10000000\\+remote\\_uid. This is what you want.\n\nThat's it. When you have your data sync'ed, remove everything from container's /etc/fstab so it won't try to mount things, and it should start. There might be other things to change, check what the LXC template for the containerised distro does. You can definitely remove the kernel, grub, ntp and any hardware\\-probing packages in the container (you don't even have to run it, you can chroot to the container from the user namespace)\n\nIf you don't have a running remote VM, you can also mount the original VM storage in the host namespace and rsync/SSH back in to localhost. The effect will be the same.\n\nIf you (as it seems) simply want to change your privileged container to unprivileged, you might as well just add the uid/gid mapping, add a mapping as above to your container config and then do something along the lines of:\n\n```\nfor i in `seq 0 65535`; do\n  find /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs -uid $i -exec chown $((10000000+i)) \\{\\} \\;\n  find /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs -gid $i -exec chgrp $((10000000+i)) \\{\\} \\;\ndone\n\n```\n\nThat should be all that needs doing, now you should be able to run the container unprivileged. This example above is extremely inefficient, uidshift will probably do a better job at this (but I haven't used it yet).\n\nHTH."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: You have a privileged LXC container that you want to migrate to an unprivileged container.

Pretty close to what you are measuring.\n\nMaybe you can try to just measure the difference between active and stop current and see if that difference corresponds to the difference calculated from values in the datasheet.\n\nEDIT1:\n\nI'd also suggest to perform `SystemClock_Config()` at the start of the program and not at the end of the `while()` loop. The content of the registers is preserved during stop of the controller.\n\nI must say that I am a bit curious what a microcontroller is supposed to do when it is not connected to anything.\n\nEDIT2:\n\nI was thinking that the debugger/programmer might interfere with your measurement, but if you disconnect the SWDIO and SWCLK line and reset the controller it should be fine. The debugger can enable some internal debugging peripherals which might consume additional current. Resetting or power cycling will reset those peripherals, so they are inactive.\n\nAt this point I am at a loss what might cause this current draw.

The LM1117 datasheet shows a typical quiescent current of 5mA, which, when added to the typical 500\u00b5A of the MCU in Stop mode, results in about 5.5mA total current draw. This closely matches the measured 5.6mA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the code shows proper GPIO configuration for low-power mode.

Now, I've made my first steps into a project where I'm working with a number of equally unexperienced programmers which is why we have produced a bit of spaghetti code. I'm trying to learn how to use testing and other techniques to improve the code quality but one of my newbie co\\-workers says that tests make things more difficult. Apparently, he has done internships in teams where unit tests were used.\n\nHe argued that tests were constantly in his way when he tried to implement a new feature. The tests would fail after he had changed the code. So he had to adapt the tests which of course increased his workload.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense to me. I thought tests were supposed to make things easier. So, I suspect that he either didn't implement the features correctly or that the unit tests were badly done. So, I'm wondering: How can I write unit tests so that they don't fail just because a new feature was implemented?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By making them test just the thing they're about, and not lots of unrelated properties that are true now but might change later.\n\nSome examples from my experience. Often systems are supposed to send notifications to their users when certain things happen. With a proper test harness, it's easy to mock email messages and verify that they go out, get to the correct recipient and say what they're supposed to say. However, it's not a good idea to assert simply \"When this even happens, this user receives that exact message text\". Such a test would fail whenever the I18N texts are revised. It's much better to assert \"The message contains the user's new password / The link to the announced resource / the user's name and a greeting\", so that the test keeps working and only breaks when the routine does, in fact, not do its stated job.\n\nSimilarly, when you test auto\\-generated IDs for something, never assume that whatever value is generated at the moment will always be generated. Even when your test harness doesn't change, the implementation of that feature might change so that the outcome changes while still fulfilling its contract. Again, you don't want to assert \"The first user receives ID AAA\", but rather \"The first user receives an ID composed of letters, and the second user receives an ID also composed of letters and distinct from the first one\".\n\nIn general, beware of testing things that aren't in the contract for the thing you're testing. Understanding what is *essentially* true about the behaviour of a unit and what is only *accidentally* true is the key to writing minimal covering tests \\- and it is also extremely helpful for understanding the system and maintaining it successfully. This is one way in which test\\-driven development improves outcomes even when not catching bugs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a system that sends notifications to users when certain events occur.

It tests the essential behavior of the notification system without being overly specific or brittle.\n\nA) is incorrect because it tests for an exact message text, which may change with updates to internationalization or minor text revisions.

This allows for flexibility in the message content while still ensuring the core purpose of the notification is met.\n\nC) is incorrect because it's testing an arbitrary characteristic (message length) that's not essential to the functionality and could easily change with minor updates.\n\nD) is incorrect as it focuses on an implementation detail (specific email address) that might change and is not crucial to the core functionality being tested.\n\nThe key principle here is to write tests that focus on the essential behavior and contract of the code, rather than incidental details that may change.

Thus, SL(2,R) is embedded into $O(V,b)$ \\- the orthogonal group of V with respect to the form $b$. \n\nConsider a spin representation of $O(V,b)$, this is a representation in the space of dimension $2^N$. One can restrict this representation to $SL(2,R)\\\\subset O(V,b)$.\n\nThe question is: how to decompose this representation of SL(2,R) of dimension $2^N$ into irreducibles?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes this question is a bit old, but I can never resist some fun character theory. Maybe you have already figured out a satisfactory answer to your original question, but in case not, here is a purely computational method for finding the decomposition you seek.\n\nBy general weight theory, the weights of the representation of $SL\\_2$ of dimension $2n\\+1$ are $\\\\langle(2n)\\\\beta, (2n\\-2\\)\\\\beta, \\\\ldots,(\\-2n\\+2\\)\\\\beta, (\\-2n)\\\\beta\\\\rangle$ where $\\\\beta$ is the highest weight of the defining 2\\-dimensional representation (Although $\\\\omega$ is more standard for weights, I use $\\\\beta$ here to avoid confusion with the $\\\\omega$'s I use for the weights of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$).\n\nThe weights of the $2n\\+1$ dimensional representation of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ are $\\\\langle\\\\omega\\_1, \\-\\\\omega\\_1\\+\\\\omega\\_2, \\-\\\\omega\\_2\\+\\\\omega\\_3,\\\\ldots, \\-\\\\omega\\_{n\\-2}\\+\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1},\\-\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1}\\+2\\\\omega\\_n,0,\\\\ldots,\\\\rangle$ where the weights after the $0$ weight are just the negatives of the weights before the $0$ weight.\n\nThe embedding $SL\\_2\\\\hookrightarrow SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ that you are interested in takes weights of $SL\\_2$ to weights of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$; in both lists above I ordered the weights starting from the highest weight and working down.\n\nAssociating corresponding weights on the lists, one gets the following correspondence of the fundamental weights:\n\n$\\\\omega\\_1 \\= (2n)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_2 \\= (4n\\-2\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_3 \\= (6n\\-6\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\ldots$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_{n\\-1} \\= (n^2\\+n\\-2\\)\\\\beta$\n\n$\\\\omega\\_n \\= (\\\\frac{n^2\\+n}{2})\\\\beta$\n\nIn general, for $k\\\\neq n$, one gets $\\\\omega\\_k \\= (2kn\\-(k^2\\-k))\\\\beta$\n\nSo how do we use this to decompose the spinor representation $\\\\Sigma\\_n$ (with highest weight $\\\\omega\\_n$) of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$? Let $X\\_i \\= exp(\\\\omega\\_i)$; then the character of the spinor representation of $SO\\_{2n\\+1}$ can be written as:\n\n$\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_n) \\= (X\\_1X\\_2\\\\ldots X\\_n)^{\\-1}(1\\+X\\_1\\)(X\\_1\\+X\\_2\\)\\\\ldots(X\\_{n\\-2}\\+X\\_{n\\-1})(X\\_{n\\-1}\\+X\\_n^2\\)$.\n\nFrom the weight correspondence above, letting $Y \\= exp(\\\\beta)$ (hence $X\\_1 \\= Y^{2n}, X\\_2 \\= Y^{4n\\-2}$ and so on) one gets the restriction of this character back to $SL\\_2$:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_{2n\\+1}}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_n) \\= Y^{\\-\\\\frac{1}{6}(4n^3\\+3n^2\\-n)}(1\\+Y^{2n})(Y^{2n}\\+Y^{4n\\-2})\\\\ldots(Y^{n^2\\+n\\-6}\\+Y^{n^2\\+n\\-2})(Y^{n^2\\+n\\-2}\\+Y^{n^2\\+n})$\n\nExpanding this product out, one can read off the weights of the restriction as the exponents of $Y$.\n\nFor example, when $n\\=2$ one gets:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_5}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_2\\) \\= Y^{\\-7}(1\\+Y^4\\)(Y^4\\+Y^6\\) \\= Y^3\\+Y\\+Y^{\\-1}\\+Y^{\\-3}$\n\nThis has weights $3\\\\beta$, $\\\\beta$, $\\-\\\\beta$, and $\\-3\\\\beta$, and hence corresponds to the $4$\\-dimensional irreducible representation of $SL\\_2$.\n\nWhen $n\\=3$, one gets:\n\n$Res^{SO\\_7}\\_{SL\\_2}\\\\chi(\\\\Sigma\\_3\\) \\= Y^{\\-22}(1\\+Y^6\\)(Y^6\\+Y^{10})(Y^{10}\\+Y^{12}) \\= Y^6\\+Y^4\\+Y^2\\+2\\+Y^{\\-2}\\+Y^{\\-4}\\+Y^{\\-6}$\n\nThis has weights $6\\\\beta$, $4\\\\beta$, $2\\\\beta$, $0$ (multiplicity 2\\), $\\-2\\\\beta$, $\\-4\\\\beta$, and $\\-6\\\\beta$ and so this is the sum of the $7$\\-dimensional irreducible representation with the trivial representation.\n\nContinuing this, for small $n$, the restriction of $\\\\Sigma\\_n$ splits as $11\\\\oplus 5$ (n\\=4\\), $16\\\\oplus 10\\\\oplus 6$ (n\\=5\\), and $22\\\\oplus 16\\\\oplus 12\\\\oplus 10\\\\oplus 4$ (n\\=6\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the spin representation of O(V,b) restricted to SL(2,R) as described in the documentation.

There are some programs that can attempt to recover the data by passing the drive images, setting the stripe size and then analyzing the data. However I have no idea how people are getting the individual drive images. \n\nI understand I can't mount the array of disks but I was hoping I could mount them one at a time. Perhaps connect just one and set it as a RAID 0, but I can't figure out how to do this without erasing the contents of the drive. If I lose the RAID table data then that would be ok. \n\n@ kasperd\n\nJBOD or some kind of \"pass through\" option would be exactly what I need. Disabling the RAID and just mounting a single drive. \n\nI looked through my controller options but did not see any option like that.

The first variable (X1) is a solar radiation variable from NWP software, while the second variable (X2) is another NWP output variable. The model with X1 alone has an R\u00b2 of 0.564, and adding X2 increases R\u00b2 to 0.565. The partial F-test shows statistical significance due to a large sample size (n=2949).

The actual increase in R\u00b2 is very small (0.001). However, the correct interpretation depends on the specific context of solar radiation prediction. In some fields, even a tiny improvement could be meaningful if it leads to better predictions or decisions. The researcher needs to determine what magnitude of improvement in R\u00b2 would be practically significant in this particular context, rather than relying solely on statistical significance or dismissing the result outright.

I am stuck beyond that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Step 1**\n\n3 is always a prime factor. \n\n**Step 2**\n\nWe show that there are infinitely many numbers of the form $11, 111, \\\\ldots$ which are divisible by any $x$, where $x$ is not a factor of $2$ and $5$.\n\nConsider $S \\= \\\\{11, 111, 1111, \\\\ldots, 111111111111111\\\\}$ (15 ones in the last one). So there are $14$ numbers in this set. Divide each one by $13$, and then the remainder modulo $13$ for each number is from $0$ to $12$. Since there are $14$ remainders (from the set S) and only $13$ possible outcomes, therefore there are $2$ numbers for which, the remainder is the same. Then the difference of these two numbers is now divisible by $13$. This difference is of the form $11111\\\\ldots00000$ ($a$ $1\u2019s$ and $b$ $0\u2019s$). That means the number $1111\\\\ldots111$ (with $a$ $1\u2019s$) from this set is divisible by $13$. \n\nThis means there are infinitely many numbers of this form divisible by $13$. The same argument can be extended to any $x$.

To achieve a boundless condition where waves propagate without reflection, as shown in the example, we need to set u_t + u_x = 0 at the right boundary. This condition ensures that the outgoing wave (moving to the right) passes through the boundary without generating a reflected wave.\n\nOption A is incorrect because setting boundary values to zero would create a fixed boundary condition, leading to reflections.\n\nOption C is incorrect because periodic boundary conditions would cause the wave to wrap around, which is not the desired boundless behavior.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while frequency domain methods can be useful for certain wave problems, they are not necessary for implementing boundless conditions in the time domain as described in the example.\n\nThe key insight is that the boundless condition is achieved by carefully setting the boundary condition to allow the outgoing wave to pass through without generating reflections."}}
