It's aimed at Arduino, but the concepts are all applicable to any microcontroller.\n\n> IR detectors are little microchips with a photocell that are tuned to listen to infrared light. They are almost always used for remote control detection \\- every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to listen for the IR signal from the clicker. Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels. IR light is not visible to the human eye, which means it takes a little more work to test a setup.\n> \n> \n> In this tutorial we will show how to\n> \n> \n> * Test your IR sensor to make sure its working\n> * Read raw IR codes into a microcontroller\n> * Create a camera intervalometer\n> * Listen for 'commands' from a remote control on your microcontroller"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a microcontroller-based system to receive and interpret IR signals from a remote control. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for accurately detecting and decoding the IR signals?\n\nA) Use an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to continuously sample the IR sensor's output and analyze the resulting waveform in software.\n\nB) Implement a simple voltage threshold detector and measure the time between rising and falling edges to determine the binary values.\n\nC) Use an IR detector module tuned to the carrier frequency, connect its output to a digital input pin, and measure pulse widths in software to decode the signal.\n\nD) Employ a specialized IR decoding chip that directly outputs the decoded command values to the microcontroller via a serial interface.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach for accurately detecting and decoding IR signals in a microcontroller-based system. This method aligns with the concepts presented in the documentation:\n\n1. It uses an IR detector module, which is specifically designed to detect IR signals and filter out ambient light and noise.\n2. Connecting the output to a digital input pin allows for simple and efficient signal detection.\n3. Measuring pulse widths in software provides flexibility to decode various protocols and adapt to different timing requirements.\n\nOption A (using an ADC) would be unnecessarily complex and resource-intensive for this application. Option B (simple threshold detector) might work for some basic protocols but would be less reliable and adaptable than option C.

That means you don't think enough about lane dynamics yet. As AP mid, the way you play is basically you push the lane to the enemy tower and go do other stuff (gank other lanes, take a jungle camp, take blue, etc.). You can do that freely because the lane is pushed, the opponent can't destroy your tower since he has to push the lane back first which takes about 30 seconds to a minute until the minions are at your tower, depending on how strong you pushed the lane and how strong the opponents champion can push.  \n\nThat is enough time to go to another lane and help them.  \n\nIf you destroyed the first tower, you can push the lane even further back, giving you even more time to gank other lanes.\n\nGenerally speaking, once you destroyed the tower or gained the ability to insta\\-clear a minion wave, you should spend as little time as possible in your lane and as much time as possible ganking other lanes and then be there just in time to catch the big counterwave coming in range of your tower. In the meantime take your and sometimes even his wraith camp for some bonus farm while you go to top or bottom lane.\n\nAnother way to approach this situation with more defensive mids is to freeze the lane, that means let the lane come to you and tank it far enough away from your tower that it doesn't shoot but close enough that the enemy mid can't farm your minions. Then farm very, very slowly which denies the opponent his farm since he can't reach your minions safely and since he has no tower to back him up, it makes him extremely vulnerable to ganks which can snowball your advantage even further. However, defensive mids will rarely get into this situation in the first place.\n\nHowever, the situation most likely means that the opposing team is just bad, so you could do whatever and still win. It should never occur in a match of equally strong teams of decent skill."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: As an AP mid-laner who has destroyed two enemy towers early in the game, what is the most effective strategy to maintain and extend your advantage?\n\nA) Stay in your lane to protect your tower and continue pushing\nB) Roam to other lanes to help teammates, taking jungle camps along the way\nC) Freeze the lane near your tower to deny the enemy farm\nD) Focus on becoming the team's jungler since you can't safely push further\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B because it aligns with the optimal strategy described in the documentation. After destroying towers and gaining the ability to quickly clear minion waves, the best approach is to spend minimal time in your lane and maximize time helping other lanes. This strategy allows you to:\n\n1. Extend your advantage to other parts of the map\n2. Help teammates in other lanes get ahead\n3. Take jungle camps for additional farm and experience\n4. Maintain pressure on your lane by quickly clearing waves before roaming\n\nOption A is incorrect because staying in lane doesn't maximize your impact on the game. Option C, while a valid strategy in some situations, is more suited for defensive play and doesn't capitalize on your advantage. Option D is incorrect as it suggests abandoning your lane entirely, which is not advisable for an AP mid-laner.\n\nThe key is to balance pushing your lane quickly, roaming to impact other lanes, and returning to catch incoming waves, thereby maintaining pressure across the map and denying the enemy team opportunities to recover."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/08/12", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/66829", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/8786/"], "docs_id": 66829, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am creating an annotated bibliography.

Also, note that I've pulled a constant factor $\\\\sqrt{2/a}$ out of the constants and put it into brackets\\-\\-\\-you'll see the reason for that in a bit.)\n\nThe thing is, this expression $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ doesn't have any physical meaning as is. You also have to pick values for the $c\\_n$ before you can think of it as a particular state.

What that means, though, is pretty deep. The idea is that when you're in a superposition of many states, you have a certain probability to end up in any of them. If I measure the energy of a particle in state $\\\\psi$, the wavefunction will collapse into a randomly selected one of the states\n$$\n \\\\psi\\_n \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right)\n$$\n(I think these are the separable solutions to which you refer) and you'll measure an energy $E\\_n \\= \\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$; the probability that the state will end up in any particular state $n$ is $\\|c\\_n\\|^2$, or in this case $1/100$. So: you start out in $\\\\psi$, I measure your energy to be $E\\_n$, and you end up in a state $\\\\psi\\_n$.\n\nIt's important to understand that which state you end up in is *totally random*. There is absolutely no way to tell beforehand what state it'll be, and therefore what energy will be measured\\-\\-\\-no hidden variables that determine what the state will turn out, and no correlations with other variables. Sure, you know that some states (those with the largest $c\\_n$ associated) will be more likely than others, but that's it. This is the principle behind many hardware random number generators.\n\nYou're presumably wondering about those functions $\\\\psi\\_n$. I haven't told you why the state will collapse into those particular functions. What's so special about the $\\\\psi\\_n$ as opposed to some other function\\-\\-\\-say, $\\\\arccos(\\\\sinh(\\\\exp(x)))$? Also, I just pulled the numbers $E\\_n$ out of nowhere, which is distinctly unsporting. \n\nWhat's going on is that these functions are *eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian* with *eigenvalue* $\\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2m}$. The vocabulary about eigen\\-stuff is just putting names to some facts I you've already realized: namely, that when I apply the Hamiltonian \n$$\n H \\= \\-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{dx}\n$$\nto one of the states $\\\\psi\\_n$, I get back $\\\\psi\\_n$ (the eigenfunction) multiplied by a constant $E\\_n$ (the eigenvalue)\\-\\-\\-that is to say,\n$$\n \\-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{dx} \\\\psi\\_n \\= \\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{a}} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi x}{a}\\\\right) \\= E\\_n \\\\psi\\_n,\n$$\nwhich is just the (time\\-independent) Schrodinger equation. So, t'm in ao rephrase my summary: you start out in a superposition of states, I measure your energy, and you end up in some eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.\n\nThis is one (well, two) of the general axioms of quantum mechanics: if the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are $\\\\psi\\_n$ (these don't have to be the $\\\\psi\\_n$ I wrote down above, if the Hamiltonian is not the square\\-well Hamiltonian) and I measure the energy of a particle in a state $\\\\psi$, then the particle will end up in a state $\\\\psi\\_n$ with probability\n$$\nP(n) \\= \\\\left\\|\\\\int\\_{\\-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi\\_n^\\* \\\\psi\\\\ dx\\\\right\\|^2 \\= \\|c\\_n\\|^2\n$$\n(where $^\\*$ denotes complex conjugation\\-\\-\\-that always causes me some confusion, since mathematicians use the symbol differently). That last step (where I bring in the $c\\_n$s) is not totally obvious. It follows from the fact that the $\\\\psi\\_n$ are *orthonormal*\\-\\-\\-that is, $\\\\int\\_{\\-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi\\_j^\\*\\\\psi\\_k\\\\ dx \\= 1$ if $j \\= k$, and $0$ if $j \\\\ne k$. You'll want to work out for yourself exactly how that works. First, notice that the $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ can be written nicely in terms of the $\\\\psi\\_n$; then, plug that $\\\\psi\\_{general}$ into the above expression for $P(n)$; finally, prove that the particular $\\\\psi\\_n$ I wrote for the square\\-well case are orthonormal using a trig identity (that's why I put the constant out front of them). \n\nThis imposes the very important constraint that\n$$\n\\\\sum \\|c\\_n\\|^2 \\= \\\\sum P(n)\\= 1\\.\n$$\nThe particle has to end up in at least one of the states, so the sum of the probabilities can't be less than $1$, and it would be total nonsense for the total probability to be greater than $1$, so $1$ it is. This is called \"normalization\", as in \"the state is normalized\".\n\nAs another fun exercise, explore the state I gave you as a specific example. Plot it ($x$ in units of $a$), change that 100 to a bunch of different numbers $N$ (you'll have to change the value of the $c\\_j$ so that the state is normalized), and plot again. You should see that the state is more or less localized around $x \\= a/2$. What is the width of the state, and how does that width (call it $\\\\Delta x$) change with N? Given that the momentum of an eigenstate $\\\\psi\\_n$ is $p\\_n \\= \\\\sqrt{2mE} \\= n\\\\pi\\\\hbar /a$, how does this relate to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle? \n\nI should note that I've skipped a whole bunch of details, and not just in that exercise at the end.

This new definition has better typesaftey since it requires a function, while yours will accept any value, and will do nothing unless there are side effect required to evaluate the value passed in. We also now call the function passed in for its side effects instead of just returning it.\n\nThe problem with `Unit` is that when a unit is required any value can be provided which will be automatically discarded for a `Unit`. For example, with your code `new Button(5)` is valid, as is the code `val x: Unit = 5`.\n\nThe reason the first code `class Button( act: => Unit) {def fire = act}` \"works\", is you call the method foo, and pass the result into the `Button` constructor. Since it's a by\\-name parameter `foo` doesn't actually run until it's used. When you then use the Unit value passed into the class, the expression needs to be evaluated so `foo` is fun.\n\nYou second example is different however, adding the underscore (`foo _`) now means that you are passing in the method itself as a function, instead of calling the method and passing in the result as in your first example. It's perfectly fine to pass a function in to the constructor even thought the type now is not `Unit` since as discussed earlier any value can be discarded and replaced by `Unit`. When you evaluate the Unit value, there are no side effects this time since you don't run the method to get the unit, just create a function which is the discarded without being run. `def fire = act`\n\nWhen you change the type to be a function. \n\n```\nclass Button( act: () => Unit) {def fire = act()}\n\n```\n\nnow only a `() => Unit` is a valid argument instead of anything, and the fire method runs that function."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Scala, consider the following class definition:\n\n```scala\nclass Button(act: => Unit) {\n  def fire = act\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the primary reason why passing `foo _` (where `foo` is a method) to the Button constructor behaves differently from passing `foo` directly?\n\nA) The underscore creates a lazy evaluation of the method\nB) The underscore converts the method to a function object without invoking it\nC) The underscore causes the method to be invoked immediately\nD) The underscore makes the parameter call-by-value instead of call-by-name\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. When `foo _` is used, it converts the method `foo` into a function object without invoking it. This is different from passing `foo` directly, which would be treated as a call-by-name parameter and evaluated when `act` is used inside the `Button` class.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the underscore doesn't create lazy evaluation; the call-by-name parameter already provides that.\nOption C is incorrect because the underscore actually prevents immediate invocation, rather than causing it.\nOption D is incorrect because the underscore doesn't change the call-by-name nature of the parameter; it changes what's being passed (a function object instead of a deferred method call).\n\nThis question tests understanding of Scala's method-to-function conversion, call-by-name parameters, and the distinction between passing a method reference and its result."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/12/22", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1945005", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/139459/"], "docs_id": 1945005, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It has been long time since we have been validating our forms using JavaScript.

I already tried killing the silverfish but more spawn after it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No, this is not a bug. It is an intentional feature.** (though I've never seen it in Hunger Games before)\n\nIn Minecraft, there are \"bug blocks\" accessible in the creative inventory. They look exactly like stone bricks (or a variation of), stone, or cobblestone. These blocks are called ID's similar to \"Stone Brick Monster Egg.\"\n\nSilverfish have a special property \\- when they get hit, they summon more. They can only summon more from these bug blocks, destroying the block in the process\\*. If left alone, a silverfish will disappear into a non\\-bug stone, cobble or stone brick block and turn it into a bug block. \n\nWhenever devious map makers want to cause chaos, they often spawn in a silverfish and surround it with bug blocks. Apparently the Hunger Games map had bug blocks, and you attacking the silverfish summoned more. \n\n\\*Bug blocks also summon silverfish when broken by the player.\n\nYou can **prevent a horde of silverfish** by:\n\n* **One hitting the silverfish**. Silverfish which are one\\-hitted (killed in one strike with a weapon) don't summon more, even if there are bug blocks around.\n* **Not digging bug blocks**. When you try to dig a bug block, it will dig sort of slow compared to a pickaxe, but quite quickly compared to the fist. It is a unique digging speed, meaning it can't be reproduced with a pickaxe \\- so experienced players can tell if they are digging a bug block.\n* **Running**.

Fund. Math., 78(3\\):193\u2013203, 1973\\. \n\nActually, there is a very interesting mathematical story here, and several problems. \n\nThe question was first asked about uncountable sets of reals and $\\\\omega\\_1$. Quickly, it was recognized to be a problem about what we now call non\\-special orders. $L$ is *non\\-special* iff $L\\\\to(\\\\omega)^1\\_\\\\omega$, meaning that if $L$ is split into countably many pieces, at least one is not reverse\\-well\\-ordered, i.e., it contains a strictly increasing sequence. Baumgartner and Hajnal proved that $L\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2\\_n$ for any countable ordinal $\\\\alpha$ and $n\\<\\\\omega$.\n\n(In human: If L is non\\-special, and to each subset of $L$ of size 2 we assign a color, there being only finitely many colors to begin with, then for any countable ordinals $\\\\alpha$ there is a subset of $L$ order isomorphic to $\\\\alpha$, all of whose 2\\-sized subsets are assigned the same color.)\n\nTheir original proof uses Martin's axiom, as it depends on a kind of diagonalization over certain functions $f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega$ and one needs that if there are not \"too many\" of them, then there is one dominating all. This is to my mind the key use of MA in their paper, although there is another one. Then one argues that being special is preserved by ccc forcing and that the conclusion is absolute.\n\nGalvin later found a very nice combinatorial argument that avoids forcing. Clinton Conley recently found a similar proof. It rests on a kind of abstract Fubini theorem, the point being that the special linear sub\\-orders of a non\\-special $L$ form a proper $\\\\sigma$\\-complete ideal. Galvin noticed that the result should hold in a more general setting, and conjectured that that's the case.\n\nThe conjecture was later proved by Stevo Todorcevic: $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2\\_n$ holds if $P$ is non\\-special, but it suffices that $P$ is a partial order, rather than a linear order. Stevo's beautiful argument proceeds by three stages:\n\n1. To each $P$ we can associate a certain tree; if $P$ is non\\-special, so is the tree (in the usual sense of non\\-special, hence the name), and the result holds for $P$ iff it does for the tree. This is a direct combinatorial argument, but it is very general (not just for colorings of pairs). For example, it simplifies the proof that $P\\\\to(\\\\omega)^1\\_\\\\omega$ implies $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^1\\_\\\\omega$ for any $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$. We get a nice combinatorial theory of non\\-special trees: For example, an appropriate version of Fodor's lemma holds.\n2. The result holds for non\\-special trees of size less than the pseudo\\-intersection number ${\\\\mathfrak p}$. (This is one of the *cardinal invariants* of the continuum.) Again, the proof does not use forcing.\n3. Finally, a forcing argument shows that ${\\\\mathfrak p}$ can be made as large as one wants while preserving being non\\-special, and by absoluteness we get the full theorem. The argument here shows in particular, that one does not need preservation of being non\\-special under ccc forcing, simpler particular classes of forcing notions suffice.\n\nStevo's paper is \"Partition relations for partially ordered sets\". Acta Math., 155(1\\-2\\):1\u201325, 1985\\. \n\nAs far as I know, there is no forcing\\-free proof of 3\\., that the result holds for all non\\-special trees $T$, even if $\\|T\\|\\\\ge{\\\\mathfrak p}$. It cannot be a direct argument, as Stevo found examples of non\\-special trees all of whose subtrees of small size are special. Albin Jones indicated a while ago that he had an argument, but I never saw it and his webpage and contact information vanished since. In my mind, this remains open.\n\nA few years ago, Rene Schipperus proved a \"topological\" version of Baumgartner\\-Hajnal, namely that if $L$ is an uncountable subset of ${\\\\mathbb R}$, or $\\\\omega\\_1$, then for any $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$ and any coloring of the 2\\-sized subsets of $L$ with finitely many colors, we can find monochromatic sets of type $\\\\alpha\\+1$ that, moreover, are closed in the natural topology of ${\\\\mathbb R}$ or $\\\\omega\\_1$. Rene uses an argument that builds on the original approach, and in particular uses MA. I don't know how to prove his theorem without using forcing.\n\nFinally: The corresponding result in dimension 3 should be that if $P$ is a non\\-special partial order, then $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha,n)^3$, i.e., that if the 3\\-sized subsets of $P$ are colored with 2 colors, then either for the first color for each $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$ there are homogeneous sets of type $\\\\alpha$, or else for the second color there are linearly ordered homogeneous sets of any finite size. This is open, and several people have worked hard on it for years."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the Baumgartner-Hajnal theorem and its related developments is NOT correct?\n\nA) The original proof of the Baumgartner-Hajnal theorem used Martin's Axiom and involved forcing techniques.\n\nB) Galvin later found a combinatorial argument that avoided the use of forcing in proving the Baumgartner-Hajnal theorem.\n\nC) Todorcevic's generalization of the theorem to partial orders has a completely forcing-free proof for all cases.\n\nD) Schipperus proved a topological version of the theorem for uncountable subsets of R or \u03c9\u2081, using an argument that still relies on Martin's Axiom.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The statement in option C is incorrect. While Todorcevic did generalize the Baumgartner-Hajnal theorem to partial orders, his proof still involved forcing in the final step. Specifically, the proof had three stages, and only the first two stages avoided forcing. The third stage used a forcing argument to show that the pseudo-intersection number \ud835\udd2d could be made arbitrarily large while preserving the non-special property of trees. As mentioned in the text, there is no known forcing-free proof for the case where the size of the non-special tree T is greater than or equal to \ud835\udd2d. This remains an open problem in the field.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are all correct statements based on the information provided in the text.

It properly defines the new bibliography string, sets up a toggle to show \"et int\" only once, and uses conditional statements to format names correctly. It handles the first few authors (based on bbx:etinttrunc), the last author, and inserts \"et int\" in between when necessary. Options A and D are oversimplified and don't handle all cases correctly. Option B is close but lacks the toggle mechanism and some necessary formatting details."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/330473", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/6246128/"], "docs_id": 330473, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand how different privileges unlock, and how you can gain access to different parts of SO with more reputation.

According to the documentation, the main incentive for users to continue earning reputation beyond the highest privilege unlock (at 25,000 reputation) is personal satisfaction from helping others and enjoying the process of answering questions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because all site privileges are unlocked by 25,000 reputation, so there are no additional features to gain beyond this point.\n\nOption B is not accurate because while reputation is publicly visible, the documentation suggests that it's not typically used on resumes except in very specific circumstances related to expertise in particular tags.\n\nOption C is not mentioned in the documentation and isn't a primary motivation for most users.\n\nOption D aligns with the statement that users continue to participate \"Simply because a user enjoys answering questions and helping others,\" which is presented as the main reason for continued engagement after reaching high reputation levels."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/07", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/254579", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/138409/"], "docs_id": 254579, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The max that I was able to get the stats at is 65\\+.

The documentation clearly states that to achieve very high stats (even 300+ in all categories), the most effective approach is to invest in a great development team and staff. This involves hiring skilled team members, training them over time, and leveling them up.

It uses the `map` directive to create a variable `$log_referer` based on the HTTP referer. This approach is more efficient than using `if` statements in the server context. The `access_log` directive then uses this mapped variable to conditionally log to the specified file. This method avoids the use of `if` statements in the server context, which is generally discouraged in Nginx for performance reasons. Options A and B incorrectly place `access_log` inside `if` statements, which is not supported. Option D attempts to use a complex condition directly in the `access_log` directive, which is not the correct syntax."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/07", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/28911649", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4146006/"], "docs_id": 28911649, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In most cases, is it better to reverse an integer by extracting digits and putting them onto a string and use valueOf() to obtain the value; or to reverse the integer directly as an integer?\n\nI'm inclined to say the former is better due to it being ubiquitous in the answer solutions of my book whenever they need to reverse an integer.\n\nWhat is the drawback of using the other approach besides being a bit more time\\-consuming to write and read?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first way (converting the integer to a string, reversing the string, then converting it back):\n\n* Is easier to understand.\n* Is likely to require less code.\n* Is likely to be slower.\n\nThe second way:\n\n* Is harder to understand.\n* Is likely to require more code.\n* Is likely to be faster (for one thing, it requires no memory accesses).\n\nOf course, modern computers are so complex that the *only* way to tell whether something is faster is to actually measure it.

The direct integer manipulation method is typically faster but more complex to write and understand. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the string method is easier, it's not always the fastest. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the characteristics of the two methods - the string method is actually easier to understand and typically requires less code.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, reversing integers is rarely needed in real-world applications outside of programming exercises."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/08", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/315127", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/16952/"], "docs_id": 315127, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any permissions configuration that allows a user to delete a file but not to read from it or to write to it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A file's permissions determine who can read, write or execute that file.

Setting the file permissions to 000 ensures that no one (except root) can read, write, or execute the file. Setting the parent directory permissions to 777 allows anyone to write to the directory, which includes the ability to delete files within it.\n\nB) This is incorrect. File permissions of 700 would allow the owner to read, write, and execute the file, which contradicts the requirement of not being able to read or modify.\n\nC) This is incorrect. File permissions of 644 would allow the owner to read and write, and others to read, which contradicts the requirement of not being able to read or modify.\n\nD) This is incorrect. While file permissions of 111 would prevent reading and writing, the parent directory permissions of 755 would not allow all users to delete files (only the owner of the directory could do so).\n\nThe key concept here is that in POSIX systems, deleting a file is considered a write operation on the parent directory, not an operation on the file itself.

However, a black hole doesn't have a sign problem as you are having trouble with.\n\nIn particular, there don't seem to be any truly infinite amounts in the real world, at least not of anything involving mass or energy in any (even tiny) amounts, since an infinite amount of even tiny things yields a universe\\-swallowing black hole (again, maybe).\n\nThe fact is that infinity is a mathematical concept. And, it happens to be one that you're using slightly incorrectly. You say that at $\\\\theta\\=\\\\pi / 2$, $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ becomes $\\+\\\\infty$, but this isn't entirely true. The output of the function is *never* $\\+\\\\infty$!

But again, it is never actually $\\-\\\\infty$.\n\nPerhaps what might help is the fact that these two vastly different results actually have a very solid wall$\\-$a boundary$\\-$between them! The values of $\\\\theta$ which are below $\\\\pi/2$ are separated from the values of $\\\\theta$ which are above $\\\\pi/2$ by the one number which *actually is* $\\\\pi/2$. At this one value of $\\\\theta$, the expression $\\\\tan \\\\theta$ does not lean towards *either* side, but is rather totally undefined! That one input is actually a boundary between the two vastly\\-different results from both sides.\n\nHowever, this sort of behavior is rife through many different functions.

Failing to use wire\\-nuts correctly causes a lot of series arcing burn\\-ups of wire nuts and potential fires.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"Fits All\". Each size of wire\\-nut is UL\\-approved *for specific combinations of wires*.

If one nut is 2\\-5 \\#10, well two \\#10 is on the small side for that nut but it's just right for three \\#10s.

I would even get the Wing\\-Nut or Twister models as they are easier to grip. Do not use tools \\- you'll crack the nut.\n\nLastly, doing the wire nuts right is pointless if you then limp\\-wrist the screw torques on the socket. Recent science has shown screw torques matter bigtime \\- look at all the talk among EVers about cheap sockets getting hot \\- it's not the socket it's the lack of a torque wrench when they installed it. NEC 2014 requires setting torque correctly on any screw that specifies a torque.

There's no such thing as a universal \"fits-all\" connector. Each size is UL-approved for specific wire combinations.\n2. It's ideal to use wire nuts in the middle of their rated range.

However, I did not find a satisfactory answer anywhere else (and do not yet have the \"reputation\" to comment or upvote), so I thought it would be best to ask a new question myself.\n\nMy question is this. For each of 12 human subjects, I have computed a correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho) between 6 levels of an independent variable X, and corresponding observations of a dependent variable Y. (Note: the levels of X are not equal across subjects.) My null hypothesis is that in the general population, this correlation is equal to zero. I have tested this hypothesis in two ways:\n\n1. Using a one\\-sample t\\-test on the correlation coefficients obtained from my 12 subjects.\n2. By centering my levels of X and observations of Y such that for each participant, mean(X) \\= 0 and mean(Y) \\= 0, and then computing a correlation over the aggregate data (72 levels of X and 72 observations of Y).\n\nNow, from reading about working with correlation coefficients (here and elsewhere) I have started to doubt whether the first approach is valid. Particularly, I have seen the following equation pop up in several places, presented (apparently) as a t\\-test for average corelation coefficients:\n\n$$t \\= \\\\frac{r}{SE\\_{r}} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n\\-2}}{\\\\sqrt{1\\-r^{2}}}$$\n\nwhere $r$ would be the average correlation coefficient (and let's assume we've obtained this using Fisher's transformation on the per\\-subject coefficients first) and $n$ the number of observations. Intuitively, this seems wrong to me as it does not include any measure of the between\\-subject variability. In other words, if I had 3 correlation coefficients, I would get the same t\\-statistic whether they were \\[0\\.1, 0\\.5, 0\\.9] or \\[0\\.45 0\\.5 0\\.55] or any range of values with the same mean (and $n\\=3$)\n\nI suspect, therefore, that the above equation does not in fact apply when testing the significance of an average of correlation coefficients, but when testing the significance of a single correlation coefficient based on $n$ observations of 2 variables. \n\nCould anyone here please confirm this intuition or explain why it is wrong? Also, if this formula doesn't apply to my case, does anyone know a/the correct approach? Or perhaps my own test number 2 is already valid? Any help is greatly appreciated (including pointers to previous answers that I may have missed or misinterpreted).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A better approach to analysing this data is to use a [mixed\\-model](/questions/tagged/mixed-model \"show questions tagged 'mixed-model'\") (a.k.a. mixed effects model, hierarchical model) with `subject` as a random effect (random intercept or random intercept \\+ slope).

This method allows for modeling a single overall relationship while accounting for individual differences between subjects. It benefits from partial pooling and uses the data more efficiently than the other options.\n\nOption A is flawed because it doesn't account for the varying levels of X across subjects and loses information by reducing each subject's data to a single coefficient.

It is a many\\-sorted first\\-order theory. The sorts include numbers (natural, real, complex), sets, ordered pairs and other tuples, functions, manifolds, projective spaces, Hilbert spaces, and whatnot. There are axioms asserting the basic properties of these and the relations between them. For example, there are axioms saying that the real numbers form a complete ordered field, that any formula determines the set of those reals that satisfy it (and similarly with other sorts in place of the reals), that two tuples are equal iff they have the same length and equal components in all positions, etc.\n> \n> \n> There are no axioms that attempt to reduce one sort to another. In particular, nothing says, for example, that natural numbers or real numbers are sets of any kind. (Different mathematicians may disagree as to whether, say, the real numbers are a subset of the complex ones or whether they are a separate sort with a canonical embedding into the complex numbers. Such issues will not affect the general idea that I'm trying to explain.) So mathematicians usually do not say that the reals are Dedekind cuts (or any other kind of sets), unless they're teaching a course in foundations and therefore feel compelled (by outside forces?) to say such things.\n\nQuestion: *If set theorists just want to do set theory and not worry about foundations (and encodings of mathematical objects as sets), do they also work in the theory T?* Or are they always regarding every object as a set?\n\nAlso, do I understand it correctly that it's hard to actually formalize the syntax of the theory T, because of the many types and connotations of natural language involved?

If Newton's second law was incorrect then the dimensions of energy might be different, but we don't believe the second law is wrong because too many well established bits of Physics would break if it weren't correct.\n\nYou need to be a bit careful when your geometry isn't Euclidean, e.g. in special and general relativity, and you may wish to write the second law as something like:\n\n$$F \\= m\\_0 a \\+ \\\\text{higher order terms}$$\n\nbut as Manishearth says in his comment, the extra terms have to have the same dimensions as $m\\_0a$ because you can't add terms that have different dimensions (well, not if you want it to make physical sense)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on dimensional analysis and Newton's second law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the units of energy in physics?\n\nA) The units of energy are fundamentally derived from Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation E = mc^2.\n\nB) The units of energy (ML^2T^-2) are a convention that could be arbitrarily changed without affecting physical laws.\n\nC) The units of energy (ML^2T^-2) are a direct consequence of Newton's second law and the definition of work, and remain valid even in relativistic contexts.\n\nD) In non-Euclidean geometries, such as those used in general relativity, the units of energy must be fundamentally different from ML^2T^-2.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The units of energy (ML^2T^-2) are derived from dimensional analysis of Newton's second law (F = ma) and the definition of work (W = F * d). This relationship holds true even in more complex physical theories like special and general relativity, where additional terms may be added to equations but must maintain the same dimensions for consistency. While Einstein's E = mc^2 is a famous energy equation, it doesn't define the units of energy. The units remain consistent across classical and relativistic physics, making them a fundamental aspect of how we describe energy in nature, not just a conventional choice."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/26", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/104017", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/140894/"], "docs_id": 104017, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Under the ***Projects \\& Interest*** section\\-\\-as it appears in the pdf view of my SO Careers Profile\\-\\-is the url for my SO user page, and below that:\n\n> Written 328 answers.

Enable \"Show administrative tools\" in the Start screen settings.\nC) The search indexing service is malfunctioning. Rebuild the search index to resolve the problem.\nD) PowerShell ISE is not compatible with the Start screen search. Pin it to the Start screen as a workaround.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue is that PowerShell ISE is categorized as an Administrative Tool, which is hidden from Start screen search results by default in Windows 8. To resolve this, the user needs to enable the \"Show administrative tools\" option in the Start screen settings. This can be done by:\n\n1. Opening the Start screen\n2. Pressing Win+I to open the settings for the Start screen\n3. Selecting the \"Tiles\" option\n4. Toggling on the \"Show administrative tools\" option\n\nOnce this setting is enabled, PowerShell ISE will appear in partial search results on the Start screen.

According to the documentation, items given to NPCs through pickpocketing are not permanently stored in their inventory. These items can disappear after certain events occur, such as leaving the area or simply allowing time to pass in the game. This mechanic prevents players from using NPCs as permanent storage for their items.

The iPhone 3GS is still for sale and clearly it doesn't cost as much to make now as it did on the day it was released. It's also clear that each device released at the $650 retail price point doesn't really cost that to make. Retail pricing is more of a calculated gamble that the market will bear that price. Only months to years later can the margins be measured.\n\nI think the cart is a bit before the horse as I read your question.

Instead, it quotes Horace Dediu, who describes the iPhone as a \"salesman\" for mobile broadband services, receiving a \"healthy commission\" for this role. This suggests that the iPhone's higher price is largely due to its function in selling cellular services, rather than its manufacturing costs or Apple's profit margin.

Which of the following configurations correctly implements this protection?\n\nA) A diode connected in parallel across the input terminals, with its cathode connected to the positive input\nB) A diode connected in parallel across the input terminals, with its anode connected to the positive input\nC) A diode connected in series with the positive input line, with its cathode facing towards the module\nD) A diode connected in series with the negative input line, with its anode facing towards the module\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct configuration is to place the diode in series with the positive input line, with its cathode facing towards the module. This arrangement allows current to flow normally when the polarity is correct, but blocks current if the polarity is reversed, protecting the module.\n\nOption A and B are incorrect because they show the diode in parallel, which would not provide the required series protection.\nOption D is incorrect because placing the diode in the negative line would not protect against reverse polarity.\n\nThe module specifications explicitly state \"Please Series diode at the input port,\" which is correctly represented by option C. This configuration matches the diagram provided in the top answer, showing the diode in series with the positive input line."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/10/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/116723", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/37807/"], "docs_id": 116723, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some difficulties removing the no data part from a GeoTIFF SRTM.

Which of the following steps would achieve this result?\n\nA) Apply a mask layer to clip out the sea areas\nB) Use the \"Extract by Attributes\" tool to remove pixels with elevation values below sea level\nC) In Layer Properties, under Symbology, set the Display Background Values option to \"No Color\"\nD) Create a new raster with the Raster Calculator tool, setting all sea pixels to null\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach to remove the sea parts (no data areas) from a GeoTIFF SRTM file in ArcGIS is to adjust the symbology settings. By going to Layer Properties, then to the Symbology tab, you can find the option for Display Background Values. Setting this to \"No Color\" will effectively remove the visualization of the sea areas (typically shown in black) without altering the underlying data. This method is simple, non-destructive, and achieves the desired visual result as shown in the example images.\n\nOption A is incorrect because applying a mask layer is a more complex process and not necessary for this visualization change. Option B is incorrect because it would actually modify the data values, which is not required and could lead to data loss.

Otherwise you have to write your own such as tables/data grids for example (typically, you will have to write your own video player, good luck !). Swing is more \"modern\" as Sun engineers learned from their AWT mistakes and made something better, albeit more complex. Both Swing and AWT are event\\-based so if you know event\\-driven programming you will be at home. The learning curve is a bit steeper with Swing because of the larger number of available classes, though by practicing a bit with tutorials you should quickly be fine.\n\nCheck out this [IBM presentation on SWT, Swing \\& AWT](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/grid/library/os-swingswt/), it really is a good read.

Swing is indeed preferred over AWT due to its more extensive set of components, as mentioned in the documentation.\n2. Neither AWT nor Swing has built-in components specifically for video playback. The documentation suggests that for AWT, you would have to write your own video player, and for Swing, it refers to external resources for implementing video playback.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the chronological order of AWT and Swing, and falsely claims AWT has built-in video components.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it equates AWT and Swing capabilities, which is not true according to the documentation. It also falsely claims built-in support for video playback.\n\nOption D is partially correct about AWT being older and having limited components, but it's wrong about AWT providing native video playback support.\n\nThis question requires candidates to synthesize information about the evolution of Java GUI frameworks and their limitations, particularly in specialized areas like video playback."}}
